Way back in 2008 I came up with a square-less calendar design that combined the tradition layout with a todo list: <a href=""http://www.chrisnorstrom.com/2010/12/invention-calendar-layout-that-actually-has-space-for-notes-reminder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisnorstrom.com/2010/12/invention-calendar-layo...</a>. Things got delayed, years later I tried a kickstarter for the calendar but it failed miserably. My goal was too high and my video sucked.<p>Over a year later I just said ""screw it"" I'm going for it. And threw in $2,000 to purchase my first 250 calendars & boxes & shipping supplies. I didn't know how I was going to sell them, it was already December so I was late, but somehow they sold. In a little over a month I sold a whole bunch on FAB.com and my own Wordpress e-commerce site I threw together. I sold out in 2 months and ordered another $6,000 worth of inventory mostly for next year. Upgraded their design so they were more premium and could be rolled up. Taking the packaging weight down to just 1 pound instead of 2.3 pounds. With the new design my packaging uses only 6 ounces of cardboard instead of 1.2 pounds like before. And redesigned my site.<p>The magnet pens I make by painstakingly by hand by boiling each and every cap in hot water so the plastic softens just enough to quickly insert a magnet into before the plastic cools. I searched all over the internet and Alibaba for magnet pens and just couldn't find anything economical or high quality enough. All the magnet pens out there were just weak or impractical. Plus with mine you can recycle the magnetic cap on other pens. I've been selling a bunch on ebay since last year. It took almost a year to become cash flow positive with the magnet pens and about 2 months to become cash flow positive with the calendars. I'm really bad at sales btw, it's my first time. But it's been totally worth it. The learning experience alone is worth more than collage classes.<p>Here's my store I opened up with my products: <a href=""http://dayonepp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dayonepp.com/</a> I've got more original products on the way as well.<p>Just for you guys, use promotion code ""hn"" to get $1 off your order.",1367330291

5632191,comment,5630936,5631758,1,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"It's not misleading to point out that a country with more guns has more gun-related deaths. Indeed, it would be misleading <i>not</i> to point this out. A death is a death, and a preventable death is a preventable death.<p>Consider this: in the 1970s, Britain switched from coal-gas furnaces to natural gas, which has a much lower level of carbon monoxide. During the period when the country made the switch, the suicide rate dropped by a third and has remained lower ever since.<p>When people no longer had convenient access to carbon monoxide poisoning, a significant fraction of people who would otherwise have committed suicide did not do so. The conclusion is that a person's likelihood of going through with committing suicide is at least partially a function of how easy it is to do it.<p>In the United States, over half of all suicides are via firearms. Looked at differently, two-thirds of all gun deaths are suicides. (Less than a thousand Americans die annually due to accidental gunshots, but they are responsible for over 20,000 injuries a year.)<p>Not surprisingly, if you look at the distribution of deaths due to injury by firearm, the death rates are highest in states that have the highest rates of gun ownership. The relationship is straightforward: states with more guns per capita have more gun injuries and deaths per capita.<p>The ten highest states by firearm death rate are: D.C. Alaska, Louisians, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Mississippi, New Mexico, Arkansas and Alabama. The ten lowest states are: Hawaii, Massachussetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Maine and Iowa. (You could overlay a red-state blue-state electoral map over the same data and it would match almost perfectly.)<p>Looked at still differently, several recent studies have found that states with the weakest gun regulations have the highest rates of gun deaths by homicide, suicide, accidental deaths, deaths of children and so on, even when you control for the rate of household firearm ownership. That is, gun death rates are higher in states with weaker gun laws, independent of the level of gun ownership (though of course they also correlate).<p>Bottom line: if the United States had more of a Swiss approach to gun ownership, with its rigorous controls, restrictions and training requirements, its guns would kill far fewer people each year. But the very people most determined to own firearms are also most determined not to allow the government to exert the kind of regulation and oversight that would mitigate the risk.",1367330134

5632186,comment,5631441,5631441,64,0,calinet6,,,"Excellent article. I'm immensely glad and lucky to have had Brian Harvey as a professor, and this echoes exactly what he taught us and the general teaching at Berkeley: that the concepts of programming and computer science were of paramount importance, and that you should understand them in the abstract.<p>To this day, this is why I value a good theoretical CS education, why I value university education, and why I continue to look back on and use my supposedly theoretical and impractical CS education with great respect.<p>This is so true: ""learning another programming language isn't a big deal; it's a chore for a weekend. I tell my students, 'the language in which you'll spend most of your working life hasn't been invented yet, so we can't teach it to you. Instead we have to give you the skills you need to learn new languages as they appear.'"" Can you imagine how valuable it was to be told that from the start?<p>He's right about scheme too: part of the value of using Scheme or Lisp is its inherent crazy unfamiliarity to the great majority of students. The first thing when you see all those parentheses and weird paradigms is ""woah, this is unlike anything I've seen before."" And that's <i>perfect.</i> You don't get lost in things you think you already knowyou learn concepts fresh and the language, because it's so weird and wild and totally abstract and you can't imagine using it for any real projectis as malleable and temporary as modeling clay. You get to make things with it that teach you about art, and how to look at things, how to see infinitynot about the properties of the materials in your hands.<p>For this reason among others, it's profoundly disappointing to me that Berkeley has switched their introductory language to Python. As great as it is, it's no Scheme, if only for the fact that its popularity and usefulness as a language detracts from the underlying concepts. I have to think Brian Harvey fought this change, had he not retired and lost some influence.<p>""Every five years or so, someone on the faculty suggests that our first course should use language X instead; each time, I say ""when someone writes the best computer science book in the world using language X, that'll be fine.'""<p>SICP was, in retrospect, a masterpiece of education. Someone sat down and thought about exactly these concepts and how best to elucidate them without getting in the way of the connections being made. The new trend toward applications-focused education feels to me like the wrong direction, and I don't think I would get as good an education today as I did learning abstract concepts theoretical computer science taught as the most important part.<p>Sure, it's fun and attractive to think about applying what you learn to the revolution at hand quickly, making mobile apps and designing robots and putting everything together into useful applications, but you can learn all that stuff after a couple semesters of awesome CS core theory anyway. And while you might get frustrated for those 2 years as an 18-year-old hotshot upstart startup-minded student, in 10 years you'll look back on it and think, ""wow, that really was the most important part.""",1367330084

Nothing wrong with it.  Te code worked well and was mostly bug-free.  The company bidding to acquire his business did not do Forth and saw it as an impediment.  They, like a million others, did C.  Ultimately he sold the company for $16 million with a requirement to translate the code base to C under contract.<p>Today I use C for any time I need to do embedded work.

You nailed it.<p>I feel like I've been badly conditioned over the past few years. I've worked on failed software projects (only one my fault, years ago and I didn't know what I was doing) and in bad managerial environments, and I've never experienced team synergy or symbiotic management-- I know it exists, but it hasn't been my experience. Yet as an almost-succeeded creative writer, I'm really good at kvetching because I can capture peoples' complaints in a way that almost no one else can. I'm terrified of conditioning myself out of tech just by being so much better at kvetching (I can write a top comment on almost any forum).<p>I don't <i>failure</i> is that bad. I'm old enough to realize that good ideas fail for all kinds of reasons, and that it's pointless to get married to an idea, a project, or even a job. I can hack failure. It comes with the territory. Scrap the old project, start a new one. Most people who achieve great things were much bigger failures than I am, up until a couple years before the ""overnight success"".<p>What really drives the nail in is the low social status that comes with failure. Project cancelled? Ok, fine. Is it a transfer or a layoff? Just let me know and be fair about it, and we're cool. Lose a job? That happens. Dealing with humiliation afterward-- applying for subordinate roles for which I'm way overqualified, having to go through 47 goddamn phone screens for each company just to prove I'm not an idiot-- is harder. It doesn't help that we're a tribe (technologists, software engineers) with extremely low social status (especially per IQ point) in comparison to project managers and bike-shedding executives.<p>I don't know that it's the association of hard work with failure itself that's so devastating, but the association of it with <i>low social status</i> is, I think, what drives so many people out of our industry before age 35. Project failure would be okay if it wasn't so devastating to our social status, especially in an industry where ageism begins at 27. Then, we see people of mediocre talent and work ethic getting ahead (including $200M+ acq-hires) on social polish and it's just more demoralizing.",1367329868

5632138,comment,5631208,5631208,14,0,jedbrown,,,"The central problem here is neglecting to identify the <i>purpose</i> of branches [1] and a haphazard attitude toward ""merging from upstream"" [2,3].<p>If you use topic branches for every feature and bug fix, then you can even test them in an integration branch (often called 'next') so that they can interact with other new features before graduating to 'master'.  This makes 'master' more stable which is good for users and good for developers because they can be more confident that a bug in their topic branch was introduced in their branch. It is also easier to make releases.<p>Use of a 'next' integration branch also relieves some of the pressure from merging new features. Other developers' _work_ is not affected if 'next' is broken and the merge can be reverted without impacting the history that ultimately makes it into 'master'. Running 'git log --first-parent master' [4] will show only merges, one per feature, and each feature has already been tested in 'next', interacting with everything in 'master' as well as other new features. See gitworkflows(7) [5] for more on 'master'/'next'.<p>If we acknowledge that 'master' (and possibly 'next') are only for integration, then we don't have the problem of 'git pull' creating a funny merge commit because we're developing in a topic branch, but the same behavior occurs when we run 'git merge master' (or 'git pull origin master').  This is a merge from upstream and usually brings a lot of code that we don't understand into our branch.  These ""just keeping current"" commits annoy Linus [2,3] because they do not advance the purpose of the topic branch (""to complete feature/bugfix X so that it can be merged to 'master'""). Linus' short and sweet rule of thumb [3] is<p><pre><code>    If you cannot explain what and why you merged, you\n    probably shouldn't be merging.\n</code></pre>\nWe can usually only explain a merge from upstream when we (a) merge a known stable point like a release or (b) merge because of a specific conflict/interaction, in which case that should go into the merge commit. If you use 'git merge --log', merges from topic branches contain a nice summary while merges from upstream usually have hundreds or thousands of commits that are unrelated to the purpose of your branch.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gitster.livejournal.com/42247.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitster.livejournal.com/42247.html</a> (Junio Hamano: Fun with merges and purposes of branches)<p>[2] <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/328436/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/328436/</a> (Rebasing and merging: some git best practices)<p>[3] <a href=""http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_merges_from_upstream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_merges_from_upstream.html</a> (Linus Torvalds: Merges from upstream)<p>[4] <a href=""http://git-blame.blogspot.com/2012/03/fun-with-first-parent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-blame.blogspot.com/2012/03/fun-with-first-parent....</a> (Junio Hamano: Fun with --first-parent)<p>[5] <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflow...</a>",1367329546

Don't rebase public branches, and that includes master and whatever else you're deploying from.<p>In any case, you <i>can't</i> rebase master unless you're willing to force push, and if that hasn't tipped you off to the fact that you've gone off piste, what will?<p>> If you've got an entire history that's been heavily-rebased and your problem is ""This bug started happening on Tuesday last week"", you have a big problem: You can't just track back through your simple, linear branch until you get to last Tuesday's commits.<p>This hypothetical scenario of last Tuesday's bug therefore makes no sense. You can do exactly that, because you don't rebase history: you rebase work in progress <i>onto</i> the canonical record.<p>In summary, rewriting history would be bad, but that's not what rebase is used for.",1367328946

But I should be clear that I also strongly disagree with the statement 'always use rebase!'.<p>Merge and rebase are two similar but distinct ways to update a branch in git. They are both appropriate at different times. A very good guide to sensible merge/rebase policy can be found here<p><a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/328436/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/328436/</a><p>(see also <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/328438/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/328438/</a>)<p>I use rebase regularly. I always work on branches other than master, i.e. task and feature branches. I never rebase branches that are shared with other developers - development  to these shared public branches is always just adding new commits to a stable history. Merging is important but rebasing is a wonderful tool.<p>With respect to the issue of timestamps, I did not know this and am very glad to learn it, you do have a problem here. My position would be that I would rather throw out the timestamp chronology than abandon rebase. Typically in my experience bugs can, and usually are, tracked against a particular commit, which solves this problem. However, I appreciate that this won't always be the case, but throwing out rebase for this is a high price for a moderate reward IMHO. :)",1367328860

My experience has indicated that the French system is set up in such a way as to reward people who dont take any risks. It is not simply the banking system or taxes that is to blame. There is a cultural stigma against taking risks that does not exist in the States. The education system is at least 100x better than the best schools in America, yet good test score count for very little when it comes to the hustle required in entrepreneurship, much less web based entrepreneurship where everyone is brilliant and hard working. There is simply not the same commitment to innovation.

It is just a question of time until someone who had such a bug doesn't realize it, doesn't schedule downtime, and suffers the consequences.<p>And what's the consequence of eliminating leap seconds?  In the next few decades the Earth and our clocks will drift out of alignment by about 1% of the amount that they are already forced to be out of alignment for most of us by the fact that time zones are an hour wide.  Which very few people will notice.<p><i>Even in your example, Linux machines didn't actually crash - some processes spinlocked. And it wasn't even all Linux machines, if you were running a mildly old kernel (say, the one that came with debian etch and derivatives) nothing happened whatsoever.</i><p>If the bug had been introduced during a longer period without leap seconds - not long ago there was one that lasted 7 years - then its impact would have been more widely felt.  And it is true that it wasn't technically a crash, but many websites did suffer outages because internal services stopped responding.

If you are working that many hours there better be a good reason, like a big payday. Startups are different than PMEs because the only way you would even think about working 60+ hours is if you have some equity in the success of the company.<p>There are 2 ways the 35 hour week works:<p>1) You are paid for 35 hours/wk and work as much as you want all year long. December arrives and you go full RTT. You basically take a vacation while the company pays you the balance of those over 35 hour weeks. I've been in a few places where half the office is gone for the entire month of December, and sometimes November. If you don't use all your RTT by 31/12 you've basically worked for free.<p>2) Overtime. In my case my CDI (employee contract) is for 35 hours + 4 overtime hours that I've agreed to. Say the company only wants me to work 35hours/wk one month, too bad pay me 35+4. And if I go over 39 hours? RTT. Depending on the workplace, this can either get  collegial or hostile very quickly.<p>Also, when it's 7-8 hours of work the french really do work those hours. This is in contrast to my American observation of working 6-7 and goofing off for 2-3. But then you're always having to stay late. This pacing requires proper project management, something that was really lacking in most of my american bosses (Americans tend to inherit the manager job, to go cadre in France you actually have to take courses on managing people).",1367327659

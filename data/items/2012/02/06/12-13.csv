'Disregarding of convictions' is not the same thing as a pardon, it is what it says it is: it is, simply, 'we will no longer take these convictions into account' (and a db admin gets to run a very rare delete command).<p>A pardon would be recognition that the conviction was in itself wrong, even at the time (the paragraph of law that made sex between men was snuck into a bill of 1885 which dealt with sex crimes relating to young women. It took nearly 75 years to remove).<p>Even if it is impractical to pardon everyone, pardoning Turing would have made a very public statement alongside the 'Disregarding of convictions'.<p>I believe the statement would still be worth making and I would go further to include a few others, e.g. Oscar Wilde.<p>Note also that the bill specifically holds a paragraph to make exactly this kind of pardon possible:<p><pre><code>  87 Saving for Royal pardons etc.\n\n  Nothing in section 86 affects any right of Her Majesty, by \n  virtue of Her Royal prerogative or otherwise, to grant a \n  free pardon, to quash any conviction or sentence, or to \n  commute any sentence.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/146/11146.68-74.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/14...</a>",1328532882

3557174,comment,3557069,3557069,7,0,kokey,,,"These things come in waves.  I remember in the early 90s when organised piracy was rife.  There were courier groups transferring data between BBS systems, between countries, usually committing various kinds of telephone and bank fraud in their activities either to make long distance phone calls to transfer data on by modem, or to purchase hardware to store the data on.  These were people who often did it for the love or status, and not for money.  However, at the same time, these large boards would make money from selling tapes of the software, and others would sell floppy disks and CDs with the software on.  The end consumer would end up having easy access to pirated software through friends, markets and other means.  Then a crackdown happened, and it was an international effort.<p>People weren't all taken down directly for piracy, others were taken for fraud or anything else related to their activities in the piracy scene.  Some of it would fail in court, but it would be after a year of not having access to their computer equipment.<p>Several years later we had Napster, and easy access to pirated music was in the hands of the normal user again, until Napster had to give up.<p>Now with torrents, we had something that resembled the scene of the early 90s closer.  The crackdown is also similar.<p>After Napster we ended up with services like iTunes, last.fm and Spotify, and I think post torrent crackdown we should hopefully end up with similar video services giving us a choice between buying or renting videos for cheap or for free.<p>I'm optimistic that we'll see some improvement in the video delivery business over the coming years.  It won't be as cheap as using btjunkie etc. and it won't have as wide a selection, but hopefully not too far from it for the bulk of consumers.",1328531733

I would have guessed that it's causing an exec (or something equivalent) with argv ""/bin/sh"", ""-c"", ""cp -p /bin/sh..."". That's malicious if run as root ('4' in 4755 is setuid, so it basically hides a root shell in /tmp), but it's not 'rm -rf /'. I could believe that the post is wrong, but I'd still like to know how this works.<p>What I've gathered:<p>1. The final bytes of hex there are ""/bin/sh\\0-c\\0"", which is where I'm getting the argv from. The exec is mostly a guess, because I can't think what else it would be doing. The previous hex bytes are non-text, possibly precompiled executable code.<p>2. The '_attribute_ ((section("".text"")))' is a gcc extension that causes this string not to be stored where it usually would be in the binary. I believe the .data section would be more normal? But I've never been very clear on what the different sections are for.",1328530674

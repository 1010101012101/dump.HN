180910,comment,180311,180311,0,0,photomatt,,,"Recently switch all of the WordPress.com load balancers to be nginx. They push a little over a gigabit of traffic right now and about half a billion requests per day, no sweat. We use Spread + Wackamole for failover, there's more info on Barry's blog:<p><a href=""http://barry.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/load-balancer-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://barry.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/load-balancer-update/</a><p>I wouldn't recommend DNS round robin for load balancing. (We did it for a while, many problems and flaws in the approach.)",1209926987

180907,comment,180407,180475,0,0,troystribling,,,"The power density arguments are valid. I work in a large data center and the statements about empty floor space because of power limitations is accurate. The data center was designed in the late 90's, since then power density has increased to the point that we cannot fill it with equipment.<p>Also, the decentralized distribution of hardware described in the article reminded of a MMORPG described in the Charles Stross novel Halting State. There the MMORPG was distributed over the players hardware so that very little centralized hardware was required.",1209926388
180906,comment,180827,180827,0,0,m0nty,,,"I have Firefox on a Mac, with 23 extensions installed. Very occasionally, it bombs (usually when leaving Gmail) but otherwise it's been fine. Maybe the people who have problems should try, you know, just closing it now and then. Not exactly a high-tech solution, but it works OK for me. Having said that, I often run my computer and Firefox for days at a time.<p>I would be interested in the alternatives, but afaict they don't exist. Another browser with extensions like Adblock, Web Developer Toolbar, Firebug, etc? I doubt it.",1209926265
180905,comment,180551,180551,0,0,mixmax,,,"""We will pursue partnerships and investments to realize the competitive advantages that come with scale""<p>I don't think Microsoft will get much more scale than they already have, they are on most peoples desktop already. What they should pursue is technology - they are obviously unable to create compelling technology themselves. Besides with their resources they would easily be able to buy every interesting startup in sight.",1209926131

180903,comment,180517,180557,0,0,goodkarma,,,"In several markets - such as search, search marketing (i.e. pay per click advertising), web-based applications (i.e. Google Docs or whatever MS calls it), etc., Microsoft has really dropped the ball.<p>The two things they lack are respect for their competition, and respect for new ideas.  The ideas were there, but Microsoft didn't listen.  Their competitors did.<p>Probably the result of Microsoft getting huge and evil and not caring about their customers. They didn't notice that technology was passing them by.<p>And then there was Google.  When you get a lot of smart people working on something and give them a head start, it makes it very difficult for a competitor to catch up. :)<p>I don't think Yahoo is much better.  If the average Yahoo shareholder understood how bad ""Panama"" is given all the hype it got, they probably would have sued Yahoo by now.",1209925918

180901,comment,180589,180589,0,0,freikwcs,,,"Not much else to add except I would recommend picking up two books as well.<p>1.  A standard price theory text that will give you the basic tools of economists.<p>2.  A book that provides real-world applications illustrating how these tools are used.  (I agree - Basic Economics by Sowell is a great place to start.)",1209925344

180899,comment,180589,180879,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I don't think you are aware of much modern economics. In general, the Chicago school exactly takes the viewpoint that one is dealing with a complex, nonlinear and nondeterministic system. Neoclassical economics takes a similar viewpoint.<p>See also [complexity economics](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_economics</a>).<p>As for econometrics, they do exactly what you said economics doesn't do: try to fit the models to real life, and reveal when the models fail.",1209925061

180897,comment,180842,180891,0,0,nwinter,,,"By daily manual polling, I can track when submissions occurred and how many points they received, but I can't so easily track <i>when</i> they received those points.<p>I could write a program to poll more frequently, to look for changes in each submission's score. That might be even more valuable data than hourly traffic data. I wonder how involved that would be.<p>Is there a better way of doing it?",1209924977

180894,comment,180890,180890,0,0,curtis,,,"This is a long article -- 10 pages, I'm warning you now.  It's also one of the most interesting things I've read in a long time.  It describes the efforts of CeaseFire, a Chicago organization trying to apply the principles of public health to preventing violence.  The organization was founded by an epidemiologist with experience fighting infections disease in Africa, but the people who work for the organization -- the ""violence interrupters"" -- are mostly ex-gang members.  The article ends up mostly focusing on the interrupters rather than the science itself, so it's not really a science article.  It's still well worth reading.",1209924602

Scheme can be fast too - Chez and Icarus are known for speed, and there's always Stalin if you're willing to deal with a static program or add your own interpreter.",1209924570
180892,comment,180517,180724,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Why?<p>They should have dumped their stock when the offer was first floated (and stocks reached about the same premium MS was offering). Yahoo's management never said it would accept that first offer and all shareholders who ""lost"" money are those who expected a reversal of the initial positions (""we won't pay a penny more"" and ""we will not sell at this price"").<p>Things like these happens all the time.<p>And I would not rule out an evil plan where all MS intended was to keep Yahoo's management buried in zillions of frivolous lawsuits (that would have to prove Yahoo's management somehow knew this offer was in Yahoo's shareholders' best interest and resisted despite of that)<p>IIRC, MS was buying back stock. By making this offer they got a nice discount.",1209924556

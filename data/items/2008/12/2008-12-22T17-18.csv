So you end up working to keep it on the leash least it give you exponential run times when you were not expecting it.<p>I ended up concieving my algorithms without thinking about Prolog's backtracking, and then coding: bending the Prolog interpreter to my will by getting the backtracking to implement the control flow called for by my algorithm. It seemed a bit indirect and a bit clumsy.<p>My attempts at writing a parser in Prolog were absurdly slow. Later I read that there are ways of writing parsers in Prolog that work well, and writing parsers was one of the killer apps for Prolog, so I guess I never really understood programming in Prolog properly. On the other hand it is troubling that I failed at one of the things the language is supposed to make easy. I'm in no hurry to give it a second look.",1229968593

The statements that cannot be proven are unproveable because they are false in a non-standard interpretation of arithmetic. It is the existence of non-standard interpretations that is the big surprise, and the fact that statements are, in a sense, false that blocks proving them.<p>The equation whose roots are the Godel numbers of the proofs that it have no solutions has non-standard solutions. That is why there is no proof that it has no solutions. But the non-standard solution is the Godel number of, err, well what exactly? The trouble with the extra, non-standard numbers is that you cannot reach them by counting, so the proof they number is only finite in the non-standard interpretation. You cannot write it out. It doesn't count because we require that proofs be finite, and by finite we mean finite in the ambient meta-theory, which takes the standard model of the natural numbers.<p>It would be much better to sumarise Godel's theorem as showing that first order logic fails to tie down the nature of infinity.<p>Do we care about non-standard arithmetic? If memory serves, there are proofs that non-standard arithmetic is not computable. I can see why Bernie Madoff might find that convenient, but the rest of us can regard the uselessness of non-standard arithmetic as mathematically proven.<p>Godel's proof shows that first order logic is limited by the existence of mathematical monstrosities that we cannot use (because their arithmetic is not computable) and never encounter (because you cannot reach them by counting)",1229967559

406564,comment,406465,406465,0,0,mdasen,,,"It depends.<p>Local diets will be fresher.  Often that leads to better taste and nutrition since, for example, a fruit can be picked closer to its peak ripeness which means better taste and nutrition from it.  The nutritional value can be salvaged with storage techniques, but most people dislike those techniques because they don't taste as good (I think they taste fine, but I'm not a foodie).<p>Local dies will be seasonal - sometimes <i>very</i> seasonal.  In a place like New England, it means a winter of Apples and other produce that stores well, pastas and such, and salty, smoked meat.  It's not how people who can afford otherwise want to eat.<p>Local diets could be impossible.  Take an area like Boston.  It's heavily populated with not so fertile land.  With so much land already in use for things like apartments and offices, there's a decent chance it isn't possible to eat that local.  If local extends to the rest of New England, the situation looks better.  Right now, local food is available to pretty much anyone that wants it because few care.<p>Local food may or may not be more environmentally friendly.  There are two things at play here.  First, transportation and the associated pollution.  That's pretty easy to calculate.  The second is what you have to do to the land in an area to make it good for growing.  New England will require more resources to be spent growing that a more fertile environment.  Heck, Arizona and New Mexico wouldn't survive.  You simply can't grow enough food there for the population because it's a desert.<p>Variety will be constrained by local produce.  Avocados would become unknown on the east coast.  Oranges in the northeast. This has two effects: 1) people like variety and ""exotic"" things like oranges and avocados; 2) it means that food that is very healthy for us (like oranges) disappear from our diets and our nutrition goes down.<p>For the most part, we don't really have a choice.  We're not going to move people out of deserts because they can't grow local food and we aren't going to give up our variety and luxuries.  Local food can be a good thing environmentally (especially for items that grow well in your locality), but the environmental cost of transport is less that the cost of local grown in other cases.<p>I think the easiest thing to say is, be conscious of what you're doing/eating.  Don't deprive yourself of the vitamin C in oranges, but try not to make exotic foods a staple.  And don't waste food. Learn how to store food before it goes bad.  That will do a lot more good than arguments back and forth by people that want to stroke their own egos about how great they are.",1229965984

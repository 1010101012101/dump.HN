Market forces are usually underestimated by theoretical computer scientists, but they have a much stronger say in the success of a language than anything else.<p>However I still believe knowing C inside out is an essential skill, and as bad as it is, it's better than most of the alternatives for ""low level"" code. They usually either try too hard to be different or don't offer enough to substitute C and all the traction, coders, literature and codebase around it. And, as you mentioned, the fact that architectures became historically forced to play nice with C's machine abstraction.",1357840783

No.<p>So, how about we stick to <i>useful</i> definitions, and agree that in modern times C is a low-level language, and, likewise, understand that agreeing to that isn't going to change one letter of the C specification or remove one line of C's libraries or anything else?<p>There's no gain to be had by anyone in this silly line of argument.",1357840770

I installed it onto an IBM x3100 M4 open box special ($400!) that I had picked up and after I added 32GB of RAM, an nVidia Quadro 600 and 5 (JBOD-configured) hard drives to it, the thing absolutely flies.

5038518,comment,5037694,5038372,5,0,dlf,,,"People use the term ""vesting"" to refer to a clause typically embodied in a founders' agreement in which the shares ""vest,"" or become shares that you actually have a right of ownership over, if you continue to perform your duties.<p>Vesting schedules typically last 4 years with shares vesting quarterly or monthly.<p>So, you can think of it like this: After year one, you'll own a 1/4 of your 50%, or 12.5%. Year two, 1/2, or 25% ...and so on. You don't actually own the full 50% (i.e. doesn't ""fully vest"") until year 4.<p>Many vesting agreements carry a one year cliff, which means that none of your shares vest if you leave the company before performing for one full year. This is to prevent the ""lazy founder"" problem, where one founder is doing most of the work and the other one is goofing off, or decides to leave and take another job.<p>This is important because the first year is the most risky for a startup and requires all hands on deck. If someone flakes out, you can't have a big chunk of shares tied up in them. One, because it isn't fair. Two, because you likely need to go find yourself another founder or will need that equity for first employees. It scares off experienced founders and investors to see a chunk of your cap table trapped in a ""bad decision"" founder that flaked out. This same logic carries over to why there are vesting arrangements... you shouldn't be compensated if you abandon the company and don't put in the same work as the other founder.<p>Hope that helped explain what it is and the reasoning for it!",1357840723

It seems like every C program, even ones that are praised as being excellently written, are a mess of pointers, memory management, conditional statements that check for errors, special return value codes, and so forth.<p>To put it another way, look at the difference between an implementation of a Red/Black Tree in C and one written in Lisp or Haskell.  Not only are basic things overly difficult to get right in C, but C does not become any easier as problem sizes scale up; it lacks expressiveness and forces programmers to deal with low-level details regardless of how high-level their program is.",1357840595

Usually other terms are used; for instance, ""memory model"". If you google that you'll find some things. As you read them, notice that they may or may not match the hardware you are actually running on, and given the simplicity of C's model, nowadays almost never does.<p>C is a low-level language that lets you close to the machine, and even lets you drop into assembler, but it is true that it is enforcing/providing a certain set of constraints on how the library and code will act that do not necessarily match the underlying machine. It may not be a ""virtual machine"", depending on exactly how you define that term, but the idea isn't that far off.<p>Also, this is a good thing, not a criticism. If it really was just a ""high level assembler"" that provided no guarantees about the system, it would be as portable as assembler, which is to say, not at all.<p>For a much more clear example of this sort of thing in a language similarly thought to be ""close to the metal"", look at C++'s much more thorough specification of its memory and concurrency model, and again notice that this model is expected to be provided everywhere you can use a C++ compiler, regardless of the underlying hardware or OS.

Computer science jargon even more so.<p>Meaning that any particular term can often have many gradations of meaning.  So ""X means Y"" does not necessarily imply ""X does not mean Z"".  Especially when Y and Z are similar concepts.<p>I suppose we could lament the inherent ambiguity of the jargon, but the truth is that for the most part problems only result when ambiguous language is used in combination with an argumentative person armed with equal measures of pedantic zeal and failure to grasp the fundamental characteristics of natural language. Without that element, for the most part any reasonably knowledgeable person should be able to figure out which of the particular meanings is at play from context.  For example, even though the term ""high level language"" is used in multiple ways, the statement ""C is not a high level language"" is not all that ambiguous, even when considered in isolation.  As long as you're willing to grant that the person making the statement is not an idiot, then it's trivial to determine that they weren't using the ""everything but machine and assembly language"" definition.",1357839719

Prolog is based on a model where computation is performed by answering a query based on a database of rules.  These are all ""virtual machines"" -- the realization of these computation models is based on compiling a program for a specific machine.  It is not different with C; C just happens to use a model that is very similar to the real machine that a program executes on (but it is not necessarily identical e.g. you probably do not have so much ram that any 64-bit pointer would correspond to a real address on your machine).",1357839398

5038360,comment,5037089,5038179,8,0,cube13,,,"It's more descriptive, but somewhat incorrect.<p>The common definition of a process virtual machine is that it's an interpreter that can be written to that essentially emulates an OS environment, giving abstracted OS concepts and functionality.  This aids with portability.  Another concept of virtual machines in general is, for lack of a better term, sandboxing.  You're limited to only the functionality that the VM provides.<p>C goes halfway with that.  You generally don't need to care about most OS operations if you're using the standard library(which abstracts most OS calls), but you definitely do need to care about the underlying OS and architecture if you're doing much more than that.  Also, simple C definition doesn't allow for threads or IPC, both of which are provided by the POSIX libraries.  You're also allowed to directly access the ABI and underlying OS calls through C.<p>The best example of C not really having a VM is endianness.  If C had a ""true"" virtual machine, the programmer really shouldn't need to be aware of this.  But everyone that's written network code on x86 platforms in C knows that you need to keep it in mind.  Network byte order is big endian, but x86 is little endian, so you need to translate everything before it hits the network.<p>EDIT: I think LLVM is somewhat of a red herring in this context.  Realistically, unless you're writing straight assembly, there's nothing stopping anyone from writing a VM-based implementation for any language.  The problem with C and the other mid to low level languages is that if you're writing the VM, you need to provide a machine that not only works with the underlying computational model, but also provide abstractions for all the additional OS-level functionality that people use.<p>So C could definitely become a VM-based language, especially if the intermediate form is flexible enough.",1357839260

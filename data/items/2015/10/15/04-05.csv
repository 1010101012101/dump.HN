(Actually, Nixon did something similar in 1968 against Humphrey, by convincing the South Vietnamese government to not hold peace talks.  He not only betrayed the US but the South Vietnamese he made a deal with, since he pulled US troops out in 1972)<p>Then of course there is the FBI acting as a political police - disrupting the civil rights movement, bugging Martin Luther King Jr. and leaking information gained to the media, attacking those Democrats who were voting against continuing the Vietnam War etc.<p>Some of these excesses were pulled back in the 1970&#x27;s, but in recent years they have begun raising their head again.

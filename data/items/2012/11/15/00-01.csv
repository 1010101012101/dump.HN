I don't see them leading the way in any particular sector when it comes to consumer electronics. In audio products they're nobodies, in computing they make so-so non-descript equipment, in photography they've lost almost all the ground they once had to Canon and Nikon, in video they are being trounced by the likes of Samsung, LG, and Panasonic, and in cell phones they've just about been wiped off the face of the planet by Apple and Android handset manufacturers.<p>About the only sector they seem to be doing okay in is consoles, which from what I understand are not massively profitable, and are on the way out.",1352940980

( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies</a> ) The huge British East Indias of the world become entangled with government and rise and fall at the whims of politics.<p>This makes me believe there's some kind of definable relationship between money extracted, business size, business lifecycle, and benefit to society. A startup with ambitions of being very big, profitable and influential is declaring that it wants to lead civilization in a certain way. But if it achieves size and profit by simply decreasing benefits and increasing extraction, it's actually a corrupting force; post-hoc charity can't change that.<p>And in technology, every wave of new possibilities pulls a few corruptors along for the ride, in part because we don't always know at the outset whether they're ultimately a good or bad force.

Or like the great disk drive crisis of 2011 where people put multiple orders into multiple distributors only to cancel when one of them filled.<p>Another thing to consider (and this was true of the Nexus 4 and later updated in the article) the article said they 'sold out' but Google didn't. The authors interpreted not being able to get to a sales page as being 'sold out' but later discovered that there was some order rate management going on where the 'overflow' went to the 'coming soon' page and repeated attempts would eventually get you a page you could order from.<p>Logistics management is a tricky thing, if you are good at it you can pretty much name your own salary because its trivially easy to 'show' how much you are worth with basic accounting techniques. If the company has the volume you can literally say ""If you hire me I'll save you $700,000 a year, I'll actually save you $1,000,000 a year but I'm going to keep $300,000 of it as salary.""",1352939320

All the user needs to do is monitor this one file descriptor in his event loop, and call a function in the library which determines which of its own file descriptors have become ready, and reacts appropriately, possibly by calling callbacks if the user needs to be notified.<p>Unfortunately if you're trying to be portable, you can't do this, and instead have to implement a complete event notification abstraction (unless you know you will only ever be dealing with this one file descriptor).

Saying that ""Sony has a culture where it is OK to fail"" is laughable, for example. How many companies out there are widely successful? Most of product launches are so-so or fail to meet their objectives, yet you do not see companies firing everyone every 6 months. Iterations are necessary until you hopefully find a good proposition. It takes time to get a hit. Now that's no excuse for Sony to keep pushing bad products out of their chains, but of course, every company allows employees to fail at least a few times. R&D is about trial and error.<p>Then I think the author is deeply wrong about quoting iSupply as a reliable source for the cost of hardware. iSupply has NO idea of what the hardware actually costs. They simply open a parts catalog and check how much each part would be sold, one by one, and add it up. That is downright ridiculous, because when Sony buys chips for their Playstation, they tell the supplier: ""Make me THIS price because I will buy 10 millions of your chips"" and they have huge advantage in negociations. So, iSupply and nobody else apart from the supplier and Sony themselves know the real Bill of Materials. The rest is pure speculations.<p>And saying Sony does not care about budget and is focused on engineers only sounds false to me. If that was the case why would they produce their Playstation outside of Japan? The Playstation 1 and 2 were the examples of frequent cost reduction through their lifetime - just like the PS3 did as well, with a big step down in price from the earlier years. I am pretty sure Sony does not LOSE money on PS Vita either, and probably keep some margin there to reduce the price later. Net, they are not losing money with the Vita, and there is no need to ""kill"" it. They may need to further invest in it, rather, for it to become a reasonably successful machine, but I am afraid they do not have much cash to heavily support it seeing their overall financial shape.<p>Finally, showing Return of Assets alone is meaningless. You have to compare Ra from one business to another business in the same fields. Ra only makes sense in comparison.<p>Let me add as well that comparing liabilities between Software heavy companies (like Google and Microsoft) does not make ANY sense, since Google and Microsoft do not own plants and manufacture much themselves (their may businesses are advertising and second, software). It would make much more sense to compare Sony's liabilities with Panasonic, Sharp, Mitsubishi... while there is not actual company that covers the exact same range of businesses as Sony.<p>Seriously, when you have no understanding of finances, writing this kind of articles using numbers you do not understand rather makes you look like a fool.",1352937934

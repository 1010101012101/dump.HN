Then you only have to invest the surplus, which shrinks the investment problem considerably.  That surplus could be invested in T-bills.<p>The above is roughly how the system works now, makes sense right?<p>Of course, you'll see various peopl with an axe to grind calling it a pyramid scheme for the pass-thru payout.  And claim that the government is ""raiding"" the trust fund by selling it t-bills, or say that the trust fund is backed by quote ""worthless IOUs"".  I didn't know t-bills were so disreputable!  But aside from the silly rhetoric, it's a pretty sensible strategy.<p>It shouldn't be a surprise that the people who administer the program 40 hours a week actually kinda know what they're doing.

I shoot RAW, and then handle on my desktop -- and calibrated monitor -- all of the adjustments. If nothing else, no matter how good the camera's CPU, the awful display on the back of the camera makes serious work impossible. It just can't be big enough if it's on the back of a convenient camera, and it won't be calibrated.<p>But for your average person taking photos of the kids at their soccer game, they don't care about any of that. The camera makers do a pretty good job of fine-tuning the heuristics (white balance, color adjustment, sharpening, etc.) so that the JPEG the camera produces is usually quite good, even if it's not excellent.<p>These people will be the ones driving a new ""broadcast"" image format.

Instead they've marginally chopped file sizes in only certain scenarios, while adding numerous new downsides, while actually reducing the feature set.<p>Are they insane?

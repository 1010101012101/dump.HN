Absorptive Markov chains (for the linked puzzle) are an OR tool that solves the problem very efficiently. Even though it&#x27;s a small puzzle and it can be solved by hand with other approaches reasonably efficiently, those approaches may not scale as well to larger variations of the problem or aren&#x27;t as general a solution or don&#x27;t tie in as well when connecting a number of different optimization/planning problems.<p>Regarding the wide-ranging difficulty of puzzles (perhaps it&#x27;s just too late for me here, is that FarmOR one really an elementary school problem? EDIT: Just reread it, it&#x27;s much easier than I originally thought because I misread it), it reminds me of the puzzles in CACM (I think it was that publication). They were generally math/CS puzzles, 3 at different levels of difficulty. The 3rd was - occasionally? often? - an open problem and all 3 would be similar, but different conditions (perhaps becoming more general) would increase the difficulty from puzzle to puzzle. On a given puzzle it might be trivial to solve 1 & 2 for a CS freshman, others might challenge seniors or grad students (depending on their domain at least). The author wasn&#x27;t making a comment on the nature of CS, he (IIRC) was simply presenting puzzles and challenges. Some are easy, some are hard, some may be impossible without a lucky insight or domain familiarity.",1384746784

I think &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; and &quot;organizing the world&#x27;s information&quot; were entirely sincere, and I miss that spirit. Now I can&#x27;t really distinguish them from any other company.<p>As hegemons go, I guess they&#x27;re still better than average. And they&#x27;re way better than Microsoft. But Google&#x27;s decline makes me wonder where they&#x27;re going to bottom out.",1384743807

Power consumption is low enough that solar power is a realistic option while keeping the system portable. JamesH has also been very responsive with adding new features to raspicam/raspistill such as the very useful signal mode. It WOULD be nicer without the binary blobs.",1384743699

If you can borrow Bitcoins from someone, you can sell them, and then you&#x27;re short. While there may not be an active lending market, in principle no reason it couldn&#x27;t be done.<p>A lot of times the ETF sponsor or a related entity will participate in arbitrage to keep prices in line... they might have ability to lend to each other. In fact, that may be an important way the Winklevii expect to make money. (in addition to the fact their Bitcoin hoard is more valuable if it&#x27;s more liquid and more accepted by traditional investors)<p>Now, if the underlying is illiquid and doesn&#x27;t have good price discovery, the ETF will probably be in the same situation. In the example above, if you&#x27;re not darn sure you can sell the underlying pretty quickly at a higher price than the ETF, you&#x27;re not going to attempt the arb.

But after being signaled by the police, getting into the driver&#x27;s seat and putting the keys into the ignition more than reasonably qualifies as a furtive gesture. It could easily be misconstrued as an attempt to flee, and once cops think you&#x27;re fleeing, all bets are off. Now it isn&#x27;t just about your dog that might get shot, but <i>your own</i> well-being is at stake.<p>I did not intend to be an ass. It&#x27;s perfectly plausible that if he did that, the cops would be at him before he could secure the car, and they&#x27;d have shot the dog anyway as it tried to escape from the driver&#x27;s door or perhaps the windows if they weren&#x27;t rolled up quickly enough. And you&#x27;d be on here saying that he should have just held onto the dog and carefully transferred it to an officer so that they could secure it.<p>None of this changes the fact that you&#x27;re engaging in a classic blame-the-victim argument. The onus is not on the victim to &quot;be smart&quot; and get out of the aggressor&#x27;s way. The onus is on the aggressor to, you know, not aggress.<p>If you want to thumb your nose at the stupidity of the victim in this case, then fine.

I&#x27;ve been thinking quite a bit about it since that bit of news broke, and since it&#x27;s referenced in this statement, it&#x27;s back in my head.<p>I winced a bit at the claim of being a stateless person, as I&#x27;d previously understood that to mean lacking citizenship <i>anywhere</i>, not being without a passport for travel. Perhaps I&#x27;ve been wrong about that all these years.<p>I&#x27;m still researching, but so far, I&#x27;ve found the following passport-revocation authorities:<p>1. Obtained illegally or through fraud<p>2. Altered or misused (no definition yet on &#x27;misused&#x27;)<p>3. Issued to persons whose citizenship is cancelled<p>4. Non-payment of child support<p>5. Non-repayment of repatriation loan<p>6. Persons convicted of sex tourism<p>7. Persons convicted of drug trafficking<p>8. [based on comment below] Standing warrants for arrest (and other standing legal/court orders against the bearer)<p>Interestingly enough, 22 USC  2721 states that:<p>> <i>A passport may not be denied issuance, revoked, restricted, or otherwise limited because of any speech, activity, belief, affiliation, or membership, within or outside the United States, which, if held or conducted within the United States, would be protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</i><p>I&#x27;ve yet to find an authority to revoke a passport from a citizen who is openly seeking political asylum.<p>However, there is 22 USC  217a:<p>><i>A passport shall be valid for a period of ten years from the date of issue, except that the Secretary of State may limit the validity of a passport to a period of less than ten years in an individual case or on a general basis pursuant to regulation.</i><p>So, there&#x27;s that. Perhaps this is one such individual case.<p>Additionally, the law requires the DOS to send the passport owner written notification of revocation. I wonder if the US is considering a press statement to be such written notice?<p>Any lawyers versed in passport issues know whether revoking a passport in a situation like this runs afoul of law or established precedent?<p>[edit: formatting failure on my part]",1372743158

Did Europe intervene in the American Civil War, or in any of the multitude of conflicts in the Americas, East Asia, or Africa over the past 200 years? Even the rest of Europe abandoned Austria and Czechoslovakia to the Germans before Poland fell.</i><p>The 19th century&#x27;s balance of power was essentially established by intervening in other countries so as to not plunge the entire continent into war.  During the Spring of Nations in 1848, Austria, Prussia and France intervened in several smaller European countries (as well as internally) to crush uprisings.<p>During the American Civil War, there were a couple of wars in Europe, which were much more interesting to Europeans, as these were part of the German and Italian unification wars.  Besides, the USA was nowhere as powerful during the 1860s as Europe was in the 1910s, so the comparison is not really useful.<p>Remember, states don&#x27;t have friends, they have interests.  Why would the Europeans intervene in a civil war of yours?  But besides that, the Europeans did intervene in several conflicts around the world, particularly in places where they had interests.  Such as the Latin American independence wars (as well as other wars in Latin America), African revolts (remember the 19th century was the scramble for Africa) and East Asia wars that threatened their trading ports (such as the Boer War).",1372742966

Perhaps there will be random unavoidable &quot;corruptions&quot; in the fusing process that result in the signals for stimuli changing (i.e. sensitivity to heat and cold is probably somatic) and the brain pulling up inappropriate emotions or responses?<p>Is it still your identity if chemical mismatches change your interpretation of your memories over the long term or are you now a hybrid that, due to the transplant, has the extreme fortune of experiencing life and even epistemology in an entirely different way?",1372742891

5975933,comment,5973971,5974411,5,0,zhoutong,,,"The price of ETF and the price of underlying are simply correlated as a result of market forces. There&#x27;s no &quot;tracking&quot; between the two. The only &quot;tracking&quot; happens to the Net Asset Value of the ETF, which the quantitative fund manager must aim to follow the underlying as much as possible. In this case, by holding 100% of asset in Bitcoin in this trust, the NAV tracking can be assumed to be perfect.<p>The liquidity doesn&#x27;t matter if the ETF has a fixed pool (with regular creation and redemption). The volume of the ETF can exceed the volumes of all Bitcoin exchanges combined, because the investors are actually trading paper - certificates that represents some units of the trust, which holds Bitcoin.<p>If creation needs to happen, the investor needs to give the underlying to the trust in exchange for units. In this case, only BTC changes hands.<p>If redemption needs to happen, the investor will receive the underlying from the trust. In this case, only BTC changes hands.<p>So, at the trust&#x27;s side, it&#x27;s entirely possible to eliminate all fiat transactions after the ETF is issued. All future changes in units will happen with the underlying only, which is Bitcoin. This is similar to and consistent with most of the stock indices ETFs out there in the market.<p>An analogy: The liquidity of gold ETFs can obviously exceed the liquidity of physical gold. Actually it already does (for retail investors).",1372741387

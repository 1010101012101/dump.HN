</code></pre>
Rail can be a very cheap way to move freight. Slower than truck, sure. But quite inexpensive. I'd love to see more rail freight.<p>The problem however is that in many parts of the country the same lines are shared by both passengers and freight. This means that for starters those lines are not going to be suitable for high speed passenger rail anyway. But beyond that, Amtrak gets second priority on those lines. This is one of the reasons for the frustrating delays that rail travel in the US always seems to have.",1239918997

They implemented a very innovative business model to make cell phones accessible to the poor, by allowing the cell phone owner (a villager) to resell minutes to other people in that same village.<p>What is interesting (and relevant for HN) is that the Grameen Phone experience demonstrates how access to technology empowers people exponentially:<p>1) The cell phone owner (villager) has a new source of income<p>2) The other villagers also increase their income, because now with access to crop information and market info, they can run their crops with less waste and negotiate a better price<p>3) Women is empowered because most of the phone owners are women (who are disenfranchised in that society)",1239915720

Hence you cannot apply the same anti-competitive reasoning. Sure, what they do sucks for the people who have adopted their platform (both users and developers), but it's not anti-competitive (if it was, Android would be dead in the water). If you want an analogy, Apple's pissing in their own walled garden which is surrounded by a nice big open field (Android). You are always free to leave the garden through the big open gate (well, excepting the contract termination fees, but those aren't due to Apple). In contrast, Microsoft was equivalent to a feudal lord who owns the right of commerce over the local market (MSDOS) and comes by and destroys your little shop (Dr. DOS). OK, that last analogy is a little strained.<p>>It would be hard for Apple to reach market shares as great as MS, if they do you will see them hit equally hard for breaking monopoly rules.<p>By which you mean, not at all (US government dropped the ball on the case against Microsoft)..",1275688284

Banks settle up at midnight between each business day: at that point, there's a shuffle where they figure out how much capital they need to meet reserve ratio requirements after the day's deposits & withdrawals, borrow from other banks at the Fed funds rate, or in the worst case, borrow from the Fed's discount window.  If you figure a business day to transfer the money internally, then a business day to settle up with counterparties, then a business day for the money to appear in the receiving account, there's your 3 days.<p>(I suspect they also pad the times a bit...when I've transferred money, it's usually taken a day and a half to two days for it to appear, which is consistent with the intraday settlement process.  They want a little bit of a cushion in case some employee isn't on the ball or things otherwise get hung up.)",1275687752

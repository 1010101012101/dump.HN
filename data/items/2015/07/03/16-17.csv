When you deposit coins into an exchange today, the majority of them are sent into cold storage and remain untouched. When you withdraw Bitcoin, you are not getting the exact same coins you deposited. There is nothing technically preventing exchanges from lending out Bitcoin instead of keeping it in cold storage, which would increase the money supply.<p>An analogy would be walking into a bank and handing the teller $100. This money goes into the cash draw (analogous to a hot wallet). When the customer behind you asks to overdraft their account and withdraw $100, your note is handed to them, but your account balance remains at $100. Now you both have $100.<p>Coinbase does not &quot;defer&quot; or &quot;aggregate&quot; transactions between their customers. Most internal transactions are processed &quot;off-blockchain&quot;, which simply means that ledger entries are being updated in the background and no actual Bitcoin is being transferred.",1435942734

9826650,comment,9823561,9823561,0,0,zackmorris,,,"Here in Boise, ID it&#x27;s been between 100 and 110.  I remember these temperatures 15 years ago when I worked outdoors but what I don&#x27;t remember is the humidity.  It&#x27;s odd to be sitting outside at midnight at 90 degrees and 30% humidity, which feels like midwest weather.  It&#x27;s more usual for the high desert to get down to the 70s or even 50s at night with any altitude.<p>While this may be more of a random fluctuation than full on global warming, I’m concerned because weather has been strange for years now.  We often get excessive rain for months in the spring, which didn’t used to happen.  The weather in this location is getting more moderate, while the rest of the country seems to be getting more extreme (this is one of the long term predictions of global warming).<p>IMHO there is a connection between widespread die offs and weather that hasn’t been studied well yet.  I’m too young to remember what the northwest was like before things like wildfire control threw everything out of balance.  Imagine 150 years ago - there were large animal herds, dense lush forests, pristine waters, and one of my favorites: 10 foot tall sagebrush as far as the eye could see where now we only have cheatgrass.<p>If you go out in the wilderness today, there is so little wildlife.  Big game is rare, no wolves, a handful of bears, few to no birds, orders of magnitude less fish due to dams.  We really have no frame of reference for what settlers witnessed, when life was everywhere they looked.<p>In these death zones, we are seeing some pretty apocalyptic $#!@:<p><a href=""http://www.cdhd.idaho.gov/news/current/groundsquirrelplague.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdhd.idaho.gov/news/current/groundsquirrelplague....</a><p>The world is so much sicker than anyone realizes.  All areas are in decline, so if you look at things like timber and fishing, the numbers are down 50%, even 90% of where they started.  What we do have in abundance now is pests.  Mosquito abatement for West Nile virus is a requirement here now.  Pine beetles scurry everywhere you look, leading to the not-so-distant demise of rocky mountain forests.  So it makes sense to me that global warming may show a blip of 3% off normal and result in these wide swings.  Think of how missing wetlands affect hurricane flooding, but now apply that to all chaotic systems everywhere.  I don’t know how anyone could come to the conclusion that everything is fine (in other words, that chaos is at a stalemate or diminishing).<p>So that’s my radical environmentalist explanation.  Global warming is one thing, but the widespread famine of the natural world is looming within our lifetimes and I find that really uncanny.  Unfortunately people generally only ponder what’s right in front of their faces rather than extrapolating how it all plays out.  Although in fairness, if doing the projections leads to the same hollow realization that nothing can be done, then there’s something to be said for denial.  At least we still have good beer!  It’s important to keep a balanced perspective on these things and not let them get you down too much.<p>My personal solution to this is to live as a hipster and try to make enough money that I can not be too much of a burden on the planet (living close to work etc).  Unfortunately there’s a case to be made that income and carbon footprint are relatively synonymous, due to the level of infrastructure needed to acquire it.  Living as a hermit doesn’t really help either because we are capable of contributing more than 0 solutions to the problem.  So I always find myself back at square one with the struggle against ineffectualism.  This may be a natural evolution in global consciousness, but I just hope that it happens fast enough that it’s not all gone before we have the spiritual means to step outside the consumer capitalism matrix and do something.",1435942643

It is, however very frustrating these days, .com is still king and for example I had whole dictionaries running for my keyword*.com -- and surprisingly enough, even the most insane combinations were taken. Ofcourse, selling a premium domain once in a while for 15k, makes it possible to hog 100&#x27;s of other domains.

It irks me when someone pulls a task manager screenshot, orders by memory usage, and picks one application out of it. &quot;See, program X is using XXXMBs of memory! Bloated!&quot; Well, perhaps it is, perhaps it isn&#x27;t. You are still using it, so it is probably doing its job well. Perhaps that &quot;wasted&quot; memory is being used for caching.<p>This is specially true when people compare OS memory consumption. If an OS is not using all your memory, you are wasting it. It should be using it for <i>something</i>, be it caching, eager loading, whatever. As long as you can quickly reclaim it when needed.<p>Same goes for CPU usage. &quot;It&#x27;s using 100% of my CPU!&quot;. Well, did you tell it do anything? If so, isn&#x27;t that what you want? You want the task to complete quickly so it can go back to idle. Now, if it is supposed to be idling, and using a lot of CPU, that&#x27;s a problem (Slack, I&#x27;m looking at you).<p>From the article:<p>> The same CD that hasn’t been able to fit Ubuntu since 2011 still fits approximately 150,000 pages of unformatted English text without any compression.<p>Well, yeah. But one-dimensional metrics are useless. What about the number of packages? Did it increase? Is Ubuntu now packing high-resolution artwork, to be used with our 5k displays? What else has changed? I&#x27;m certain that the CD is not all source code, so the English text comparison is meaningless.<p>>The burden of selecting software that is not bloated is entirely on the user. The default is bloated, if you want the unbloated version, you’ll have to work (search) for it yourself. And in many cases (e.g. anything that needs a web browser) such a search may not even be fruitful.<p>Sometimes, the opposite is true. Take Vim and Atom, which are mentioned in the article. You can <i>add</i> packages to them, so increasing the perceived &quot;bloat&quot; is entirely up to the user. Unless the user takes the easy way and installs a &quot;vim-full&quot; package. Which, if we have memory and cpu to spare, isn&#x27;t usually a problem. We are talking about VIM in the age of laptops with 16GB of RAM.<p>> There are very little tools available to to help the user select unbloated software. Very few packages make any claims about their storage and runtime charactaristics at all<p>Now, here I agree. It is something difficult to measure.<p>> Over time, the battle against bloat is always lost. Even Ubuntu, which has traditionally presented itself (besides other things) as a method to extract a few extra life-years out of old hardware, is mentioned in the list above. In other words: it’s only less bloated than the alternatives.<p>Yes. And yet it is inching closer and closer of being &quot;ready for the desktop&quot;. It has to cater to a lot of people, which means bundling lots of features. Still less &quot;bloated&quot; than other commercial operating systems. Considering the number of available packages, Ubuntu offers a very good deal.<p>> or even simply the introduction of flash screens.<p>Oh, now we are in agreement. See, if you are waiting for a splash screen, you can&#x27;t do your job. The software is not doing its job. Therefore, the amount of time being spent at the splash screen should be reduced, so that we can eliminate the need for one. In the bargain, eliminating the code and artwork for the splash screen, thus reducing bloat.<p>Still, in some cases, this is unavoidable. Take games. They will often present splash screens when loading a level (if they have such a concept). Some of them will even go as far as present animated 3D geometry, using the GPU (and CPU). Which are mostly idle anyway, waiting for I/O. Sometimes, one can devise a better way of packing the files, to reduce loading times. Even more so when the actual serialization mechanism is inefficient(hi, Kerbal Space Program). But what they are usually trading off is a lag-free game play, in exchange of a loading screen (think of it as warming a huge cache). Is that bloat? The assets are huge, because we want them to be.<p>Are you developing for an embedded platform? No, mobile doesn&#x27;t count, they are effectively shrinked PCs from a few years ago (with non-mechanical storage even). If so, then worry about every CPU cycle you are using, as well as storage. Build your own linux distribution if you have to, compile with the exact flags for your platform so you can generate optimal code.<p>Running in a battery powered device (no matter the size)? Then try not to use too much CPU, and certainly not constantly. Batch stuff, run in bursts, get it over quickly. Disable any non-essential tasks.<p>Is a background task? Try not to disturb the rest of the system, please.<p>A foreground, interactive desktop application? You are likely the focus of the user&#x27;s attention, do whatever it takes to minimize the latency! The only reason not to gobble all RAM is that the user may be running other stuff too. And the reason for minimizing CPU usage is heat and power.

I did not make vague allusions nor was the power structure I described slightly different: I described a chaotic, unstable, though rather uniformly distributed power. Just about the complete opposite of the power structure we have on this planet now.<p>True, we do not know how (or whether) the world would be different if genetic contribution were small, but neither do we know that for weak ESP (like in the infamous Derryl Bem experiment, where people could guess with a slightly better than random probability, one of two possibilities -- provided they were related to naked women -- a second or so into the future). Still, we don&#x27;t put too much effort looking for weak ESP.<p>> In fact, we know it&#x27;s false for height, skin pigment, and a variety of other easy to measure traits.<p>Oh, we know skin pigment affects power very well. It just does so with the mediating factor of society.<p>> But I guess it&#x27;s completely impossible that some harder to measure trait might also exhibit similar variance.<p>So far it is you who are making vague allusions to mysterious traits that you are not even able to describe at all, let alone ascribe to genetics in any shape way or form, when a simpler explanation exists which so far explains observations rather well.<p>Is it impossible? Of course not! But what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t too different from creationism. We can&#x27;t disprove that, either.<p>If you have some better notions of what it is you&#x27;re looking for, why you believe it may be genetic in spite of drastic revolutions in power distribution among the races -- occurring over mere centuries -- then we&#x27;ll have something to study. You haven&#x27;t even made a clear hypothesis let alone a falsifiable one.<p>--<p>And I must say once again -- though of course it isn&#x27;t enough to dismiss it -- that your case isn&#x27;t at all helped by the fact that experiments have shown a strong desire in humans to believe in innate differences, even as very young children, who view social differences as hereditary, innate and immutable. It does us a lot of good to believe so: it absolves us of moral considerations, alleviates fear of change, and gives us a strong sense that what is is what should be. In short, it makes it easier for us to cope with the world -- just like religion. Religion (or magical thinking) and racism (or ingroup allegiance) appear at a very early age, and are possibly instinctual.<p>This is one example of a study (there are tons) by my friend&#x27;s former research group: <a href=""http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/.premium-1.528187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/.premium-1.528187</a>",1435940863

It&#x27;s got some functional features, but I don&#x27;t consider it to be a functional language (IMHO). If Scala is functional, then so are Ruby, JavaScript, and a host of other languages with higher order functions and the ability to be immutable, so long as you make the effort to not mutate anything (though anything is immutable by that logic). That doesn&#x27;t make Scala bad. I actually enjoy writing it most days, but I think it&#x27;s not quite accurate to call it a functional programming language.<p>For that matter, even Clojure has enough imperative parts that I don&#x27;t consider it to be functional. Maybe I&#x27;m just overly strict in my definitions.<p>Anyway, Elixir qualifies, but isn&#x27;t heavily used. I hope that changes some day, because it&#x27;s a beautiful language. It manages to be principled about being functional, while also having an easy learning curve, and rock solid dependability. I want to see Elixir grow, because a language this good deserves to be popular.<p>According to the Red Monk rankings, Haskell is close to Scala in usage. The learning curve is much higher, but I love writing it. I love the clean, simple code that Haskell pushes me towards, and it usually does the right thing the first time I run it. It seems to be gaining traction lately, and Stack has me excited about the possibility of things ramping up even further.",1435940839

The power and flexibility you need to manage styles of these components quickly outgrows the power of CSS.<p>You start having to rely on splitting the css into files that contain only styles applying to each component, so that the structure is manageable and you can find things and make changes easily. So why not just drop those styles right into the component file where they&#x27;re referenced anyway? What concerns are you separating by keeping the css out in a separate file?<p>You also start having to rely on build-time tools like SASS and LESS to introduce the necessary features to handle complexity in a large, component-structured codebase: variables, scope, mixins, etc. All these things are trivial features of JS, so why not just use JS to put in the styles directly instead of doing it with css propped up by a complex tool-chain? What are you gaining by doing so, other than having the CSS in a separate file? And, again, why is this a good thing?<p>CSS is just a technology for applying styles to your markup. For many apps, it&#x27;s in inferior technology to JS for doing this, particularly when using a framework like React.",1435940754

The great depression makes this clear. We can also see it in the current Greek situation. However, runaway inflation is equally bad, as we can see from post WW1 Germany, and modern day Venezuela and Argentina. Is it the fact that the change in the buying power of money is large and unexpected, or is it the sign of the inflation percentage that is bad?<p>2) Under the current debt based money system, the negative effects of inflation fall primarily on the poor. The wealthy purchase government bonds, which protect them inflation. They also have bank accounts, or finance debt either directly or indirectly. This means that instead of inflation falling on the populace evenly, it falls doubly on the poor.<p>3) Under a constant money supply system that eschews debt, the rich must seek out investment that actually increases productivity, rather than doing parasitic zero-sum investments (such as bond purchases and loan giving) that merely transfer value from one person to another. This would tend to grow the economy faster.<p>4) Under a constant money supply (like Bitcoin in a few years), wages and prices would tend fall by however much the economy was growing (2% - 3% a year), but the raises that people give out for seniority would tend to overwhelm the wage issues.",1435940611

This latter restriction can be avoided using FMUC.\n - Hedging your comments with &quot;(without extensions)&quot; is crass, since there are many extensions that have very wide support.\n - Talking about a minimal baseline is at best ignorant, at worst deliberately misleading. Chatrooms aren&#x27;t in our baseline, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should ignore them.\n - &quot;Not particularly suited to mobile&quot;.

There&#x27;s also the matter of insurance. I think we can agree that establishing clear responsibilities and ensuring everyone is properly covered by an insurance in case of an accident is a good thing.<p>Then there&#x27;s the taxi license. In France (as in other countries) their number per city is limited. Therefore at the end of their career, taxi drivers sell them and recoup the cost of their acquisition. That&#x27;s a sum of money they don&#x27;t want to lose. Those license can get very expensive in major cities like Paris.<p>Finally there are also some kind of regulations about the car itself (like you have to have a standardized indicator on the roof of the car, a taximeter, etc.)<p>IMHO we need some reforms to make sure every Uber driver has at least the right insurance and perhaps has followed some kind of course to be able to transport people. As for the taxi licenses, it&#x27;s kind of an artificially created scarcity. If removed, there are some costs (existing drivers will want to get a refund, then they may want to change occupation, etc.) Finally, as for the car requirements, Uber takes care of the indicator/taximeter. They also have some rules about the cars.<p>In conclusion, Uber is not trying to disrupt a market, they&#x27;re going against an existing institution with clear rules and regulations in a lot of countries.",1435939486

Let&#x27;s take an extreme case - a medium that when used will harm the receiver of the message. You might say that this medium is not neutral but the fact is that the medium is always neutral. What isn&#x27;t neutral is the designer of that medium or the one who uses it. Even in the very unlikely case that both are ignorant of the harmful effects, the medium still remains neutral, much like a destructive force of nature is neutral.",1435939238

Note that you can import files in JS too. If you want to turn it into n files, then there&#x27;s webpack&#x27;s code splitting, which makes even more sense here.",1435939220

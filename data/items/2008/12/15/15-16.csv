398415,comment,397996,397996,0,0,Retric,,,"Personally I recommend the first half of Ivan Horton's Beginning C++ for any beginning to intermediate programmer.  It's a little dated, but it does a great job of explaining what things look like in memory and why longs are not all the same size etc.  It's clear without being overly verbose.  And more importantly it's examples are strong examples of what type of code I want to read.",1229356231

The ""body"" of a python lambda is an expression while the body of other python functions is an indented statement block, with an implicit ""return None"" for fall through, requiring an explicit ""return"" for some other value.<p>Your lambdas could be like other functions.  Or, horrors, you could define two forms, ""anonymous"" and ""expression"", where ""expression"" is like python lambdas and ""anonymous"" defines an anonymous function whose body is just like other function bodies (ie multi-line, requiring explicit ""return"" s).<p>do-while/until may pose bigger problems.",1229356126

What’s your sale process and have you understood your audience? How are you going to answer those service calls and emails? Are you going to run the next Google on the cloud? There are costs associated with all of that, and, even if they are compressed by technology too, the investments required to keep differentiating yourself are increasing.<p>What’s worse perhaps is that, with all its focus on IT, Paul seems to forget that not all start-ups are web start-ups. How about biotech, cleantech, robotics? Is marketing and distribution free for those ones as well?<p>There is, as always, some truth in what Paul is writing - the man is smart - but in my view, VCs are certainly here to stay and scale those start-ups that can make it into serious money machines.

398394,comment,394946,396000,0,0,newt0311,,,"There is a problem with your analysis. Switch viewpoints to the reference frame of the traveling twin. In that case, that twin stays in a constant position and the other twin travels with a trajectory of x(t) = -0.9 c sin(kt) / k. The negative sign is irrelevant as we are only interested in absolute velocity and the negative sign implies that the movement is in the opposite directions. Then by your calculations, the other twin should now experience 0.74... seconds. Ie. Without accounting for the acceleration that one of the twins experiences, you can always switch frames and therefore cannot draw any conclusive results for both twins simultaneously unless you fix the reference frame (but in that case, differential aging really makes very little sense).<p>As to calculation the actual difference in age, I don't know GR sufficiently well to be able to calculate the aging of the twins but I know some people who do.

I'm genuinely curious, since most programming jobs that I can think of aren't exactly world-changing.<p>Yes, a programmer in the video game industry might spend their days debugging the mammary physics of ""the next killing simulator"". But they might also create the next Braid or Minecraft, helping a lot of people connect and have fun in the process. Similarly, a programmer outside the games industry is much more likely to be tweaking some bespoke piece of accounting software than they are making the next Facebook.",1314561503

Girls really are just objects of carnal fascination to many of these guys.<p>But humans today have changed very little physiologically in the last 50, 000 years.

I have a rather interesting combination of analytic and artistic talents that can only be fully taken advantage of in the context of a game and its engine. I have looked at other industries, but in all of them they only utilize a subset of my abilities. In my attempt to optimize my impact to the absolute maximum, I have come to the conclusion that making games is what I am best at doing, and I must use this to push forward society in any way possible, even if it is only to give people a spark of hope when the world seems to be eating itself alive.<p>Sometimes, games are the most useful thing one could ever work on.",1314561274

Alex can be a bit of a bombthrower, and not always in a helpful way. For me the line is drawn somewhere between <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2932298"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2932298</a> (unhelpful because indiscriminate and judgmental - and yes, reductionist.

I'm guessing the line draws itself a little differently for you.<p>Sadly, the interesting question (what if anything is the religious significance of yoga in the modern West?) probably falls in the large category of stuff that is impossible to discuss online. It always <i>appears</i> possible, but immediately degenerates into binary twiddling where everyone takes their own pre-existing bitmask, ANDs it with what they perceive the competing bitmasks to be, and emits signals of ""yes/like"" and ""no/dislike"" that vary only in intensity. The informational content of this process is low. It's like addictive food that lacks nutrition.<p>I have a theory as to why this is. High-value discourse -- in which people experience their overlapping divergences as something other than a binary opposition and come away from the encounter slightly transformed, which is a deeply human and satisfying experience -- requires <i>rapport</i>, and rapport is a somatic phenomenon. It mostly occurs when people are both personally acquainted and physically nearby. Online discussions, which have neither, are therefore inhospitable. We end up with a lot of verbiage that is cognitively sophisticated but emotionally/limbically primitive. I wonder if auxiliary in-person meetups of online communities will continue to grow as a way to mitigate this. In any case we should look for a way to increase the likelihood of rapport. I don't mean to try to bring it about (that would be awful) but to ask what conditions increase the probability of it occurring spontaneously.<p>(Normally I'd edit this down but I'm late for brunch at my sister's house, so you get the overwrought version!)",1314561105

Someone taking you around europe is attractive to anyone, and the person who is capable of making such an offer is going to be more attractive themselves....<p>Then again, there's the fact that, at least for me, its a lot easier to meet women in other countries than in the USA.

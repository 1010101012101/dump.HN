308435,comment,307261,308133,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"But it's not extortion. It's perfectly valid and legal. The client list is entirely comprised of huge corporations that could afford to fight frivolous patent suits. Do you think that as soon as they get a letter from a ""troll"" they just mail a check?<p>Also when you phrase it as ""Technology companies agree to pay patent-licensing fees to inoculate themselves against potential lawsuits by Intellectual Ventures."" it sounds like extortion. Another way to phrease it is ""companies agree to pay patent-licensing fees because Intellectual Ventures owns the valid patents they are infringing on.""<p>You can phrase almost any perfectly moral activity to sound like extortion by using the same trick. ""I pay taxes to inoculate myself against potential lawsuits by the IRS."" or ""I pay rent to inoculate myself against being evicted by the landlord."" or ""I go to the grocery store to inoculate myself against starvation."" Is the grocery store extorting me?",1221763996

Product and price are different things, specially in the software market, where the price doesn't necessarily reflect the cost.<p>So if people would not buy a 3x more expensive Windows, great product it not the motive by which it was successful.<p>I think the most accurate explanation in this case is not that Windows was a great product, but as another commenter said, that it offered a better value proposition for the money invested - and Microsoft had not the better product value, but the better price proposition,  so they won that equation:<p>MacOS had a product value of 10, and a price of 5, so the value proposition was 2.<p>Windows had a product value of 5, but a price of 1, so the value proposition was 5, for each dollar invested.",1221763527

Quiet, and did a great job, as long as you cut the grass regularly--if it gets too long, it just pushes the blades down rather than cutting them.  And then you're kinda SOL, since there's no way to get back to a regularly mowed state with the reel mower.  It also obviously didn't smell as bad as a powered mower.  No gasoline smell and the grass wasn't pulverized into sneeze-inducing particles...just snipped off in pretty little pieces.",1221761527

They claim the FCC is engaging in over reach.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear more about the &#x27;15 &quot;Broadband Subscriber Access Services&quot; pages&#x27; you mention. Where is this mentioned?<p>You might want to check out a recent talk @ NANOG from John Yoo.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJV1gWYPX8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVJV1gWYPX8</a><p>IMO the questions are more interesting than the actual preso.<p>What we got with this FCC ruling is an arrangement between the ISPs and the edge. Or you might call them the pipes and the content. It&#x27;s striking to me how little discussions of the last-mile were framing the debate, or how little consumer choice was taken into consideration. According to Wheeler, my interests as a consumer end at me not having my traffic biased. When in fact, most consumers are more interested in having choice in last-mile providers, or just paying less for their Internet connectivity. In short, I&#x27;m bummed we didn&#x27;t get unbundling in the last-mile.<p>The pipes got a monopoly. Content got the right to offer services without having to pay the pipes for the privilege. Google got the right to access utility poles. Google is the interesting hybrid with a history in content, but quickly moving into pipes.<p>None of these interests really care if you or I have choice in our last-mile ISP, or how much we pay. So Comcast, TWC and Verizon get handed a monopoly by the FCC. Americans shouldn&#x27;t have to clamor and beg Google to deliver fiber to their homes.<p>Also, what happens once Google is everywhere and they turn tyrannical? Do we need to have yet another last-mile provider invest billions to deliver service to our homes? How many Internet wires do I need running into my house to get competition? Imagine how stupid it would seem if I had multiple water pipes running into my house, or electricity wires.<p>The FCC missed an opportunity to reframe the debate away from net neutrality and towards monopoly in the last mile. If I had choice in last-mile providers net neutralty wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. If my provider treated me like crap I could simply choose another one.",1426182780

In other words, the network is in the position of having to attract both customers and drivers, and price/reimbursement are the primary tools.<p>Eventually, this should drive the margin for car-hailing networks to a stable low point, because if the price is too high customers will go elsewhere, and if the driver share is too low drivers will go elsewhere. Only by building its own fleet or by maintaining an artificial lockin of some sort (and I would classify brand/marketing dominance as being an artificial method of maintaining market power) can an intermediary network manage any level of bargaining power.",1426182610

And even that turned out to be an overestimate.  Not only has it had no lasting impact, I wouldn&#x27;t say it had a fleeting impact either.<p>In fact, I can&#x27;t think of a single measurable impact the book has had on Wall Street.  At most it gave people who already distrusted the financial industry a few more reasons to do it, but it led to no new laws, no new regulations, no prosecutions, no <i>anything</i> really.<p>And if you ignore the headline and look at the article, Lewis&#x27;s main argument seems to be that he made some very rich people &quot;angry&quot;.  Which is 1) a far cry from &quot;shaking wall street to its core&quot; 2) something he offers zero evidence—even anecdotally—to support and 3) also not true, as far as I&#x27;m aware.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I&#x27;ve read several of Lewis&#x27;s books, I like his writing, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s a great guy.  But I kind of doubt even Lewis believes this spin; it&#x27;s just marketing.<p>Edit:  It&#x27;s also worth remembering that the losers in the rise of HFT are overwhelming the big institutional players in the market.  People have this weird idea that HFT is all about big banks victimizing small investors, but in reality the big banks are the losers, and the small investors are the winners.  (Yes, really.)  Which makes Lewis&#x27;s claim that he was making the richest people in Wall Street angry so ironic.  They were already angry at HFT, and they tried to use Lewis as ammunition in their ongoing fight against HFT.  It&#x27;s a bit like making a movie about how fracking is terrible, then priding yourself about how you must have made the big oil majors very bad...not even realising that they were the ones funding you all along, because fracking is a threat to them, not an opportunity.<p>(And yes, that happened.  Matt Damon&#x27;s film <i>Promised Land</i> turned out to be heavily funded by the UAE, who has a vested interested in discouraging domestic fossil fuel production in the US.

If two songs share a lot of the same elements, they can sound similar. But sharing just two elements isn&#x27;t the same as swiping a song. Stay With Me has the same chords as Won&#x27;t Back Down, and it has a similar 6 note sequence in the Melody. But the rest of the melody is very different. And the tempo, voicing, arrangement, words, all contribute to make Stay With Me an original composition. Nobody confused the two songs until Petty&#x27;s lawyers pointed it out.<p>I was using the blues as an easily available example of musical borrowing. You seem to think different rules should apply to blues songs than to &quot;compositions.&quot; Blues songs are compositions. They have melodies. Their chord progression is just as common the one used in Stay With Me.<p>You&#x27;re incorrect about Blurred Lines. The song did NOT take the progression and melody from the Marvin Gaye song. They have different progressions and melodies. What Blurred Lines took from Marvin Gaye was the drum beat. As a drummer, I can tell you thousands of songs use the exact same drum beat. Granted, this beat is pretty unique. But so is the Purdie shuffle, and to my knowledge, Bernard Purdie never sued John Bonham for Fool in the Rain.<p>Here&#x27;s where you&#x27;re right: It is foolish to say &quot;Music is in danger.&quot; But what I said was that it will be harder for music to thrive. Look what patent trolls are doing to the tech industry. If we agree that having the same drumbeat is plagiarism, the same thing could happen to music.",1426181340

9192313,comment,9188160,9191535,0,0,weland,,,"Yes, my point was that OpenSSL <i>did not</i> throw away the standard library! openssl_{malloc|free} were thin wrappers over the native malloc() and free(), except that they tried to be clever and <i>not</i> natively free() memory areas so that they can be reused by openssl_malloc() without calling malloc() again. I.e. sometimes, openssl_free(buf) would not call free(buf), but leave buf untouched and put it in a queue -- and the openssl_malloc() would take it out of there and give it to callers.<p>So basically openssl_malloc() wasn&#x27;t always malloc()-ing -- it would sometimes return a previously malloc()-ed aread that was never (actually) freed.<p>This rendered OpenBSD&#x27;s hardened malloc() useless: you can configure OBSD to <i>always</i> initialize malloc-ed areas. If OpenSSL had used malloc() instead of openssl_malloc, even with the wrong (large and unchecked) size, the buffer <i>would not</i> have contained previous values, as it would have already been initialized to 0x0D. Instead, they&#x27;d return previous malloc()-ed -- and never <i>actually</i> free()-d -- buffers, that contained the old data. Since malloc() was not called for them, there was never a chance to re-initialize their contents.<p>This can trivially (if just as dumbly!) be implemented in Go. It&#x27;s equally pointless (the reasons they did that were 100% historical), but possible. And -- assuming they&#x27;d have done away with the whole openssl_dothis() and openssl_dothat() crap -- heartbleed would have been trivially prevented in C by just sanely implementing malloc.<p>> (We eventually plan on supporting this case, just haven&#x27;t gotten there yet.)<p>I&#x27;m really (and not maliciously!) curious about how this will be done :).

Git was more functional, but Mercurial was a lot simpler to use. In fact, almost everyone I spoke to at the time preferred Mercurial and honestly I thought it was going to be the winner. Project hosting sites that had typically used centralized source control systems like CVS or SVN scrambled to add Git and Mercurial support (including Google Code).<p>Then GitHub happened. They realized that the it&#x27;s not just the source control system that should be decentralized but every aspect of the project. Projects could be forked with a single click, pull requests created and tracked, network graphs explored. It created an organic and discoverable open-source ecosystem, the likes of which we never saw on Google Code, SourceForge, etc. Anyone could explore ideas in existing projects without having to gain committer access. It was magical.<p>GitHub may have just as easily decided to bet on Mercurial instead. I believe if that would have happened, Mercurial would be the most widely used system today. BitBucket did something similar for Mercurial and did pretty well, but GitHub always had the lead.<p><i></i> It was the project hosting sites that lead the source control systems, not the other way round <i></i><p>So, back to Google Code. It could have been something huge and it could have made Mercurial the winner, but Google Code never grokked the importance of &quot;social coding&quot;. Even though the source code was decentralized, the projects themselves were still centralized. Decentralized project concepts such as forking, network graphs, pull requests, etc - this was all from the new world of GitHub.<p>Over the past two years we&#x27;ve seen Google release new open-source projects on GitHub, then existing projects starting to migrate. Recently, Go started migration too — this is no casual move because it affects the import paths used in a vast amount of user created Go code which will build breakages. Yeah, the writing is on the wall for Google Code.<p>When SourceForge fell out of favor it was sold. It’s now filled with ads, especially deceiving ones on project downloads page which try to trick users into downloading some malware infested turd burner. In fact, for a while SourceForge were actively modifying genuine project releases to include spyware. Cocks.<p>Google didn&#x27;t do a SourceForge. If there&#x27;s anything we’ve learned from Google over the years is that they’re not afraid of shutting down projects that don’t work out. By the way, I really respect Google for this — killing products takes guts.<p>Google Code — I salute you. You did well, you made the open source world a better place, and above all you stepped aside when you knew the time was right.",1426180513

9192181,comment,9191007,9191007,0,0,grellas,,,"U.S. law fundamentally rests on the idea of checks and balances and a division of power so that no one person or body can easily enact or execute laws that are against the interests of the people. The legislative branch enacts laws, the executive branch laws executes them, and the judicial branch interprets them.<p>In the modern era, when a law requires complex administration, its enactment by the legislative branch does not end the process of defining what the law will be and how it will function. For any complex area, an administrative body is set up to implement and administer the law in its details. That means appointing bureaucrats who take the broad mandate of the law and give it life by applying it to the countless details that actually affect people&#x27;s lives. So, the tax laws specify broad enactments saying that people must pay income taxes, estate taxes, excise taxes, etc. But the IRS exists to give those laws life and to promulgate a mountain of regulations that tell us when this is that item constitutes an item of income or a deductible expense or an exemption from this or that, etc., etc. Of course, under the way that U.S. law works, any such agency must be given full authority to exercise discretion to give reasonable interpretations to whatever legislative enactments set up the statutory authority under which it functions. At the same time, the power of the agency is strictly limited to working within that statutory authority. Within its bounds, the agency has vast powers; outside its bounds, it can do nothing.<p>Thus, the essence of administrative law is the idea of reasonable discretion to promulgate and enforce regulations to see that the law&#x27;s underlying purposes are fulfilled. The power of the bureaucrats who make such regulations is <i>enormous</i>, as long as they stay within their bounds. And courts routinely accept this. So long as the regulations adopted by the bureaucrats are deemed to be within their bounds, and not deemed to be acting arbitrarily or capriciously or without rational basis, the courts defer to the bureaucratic judgment and uphold whatever they do.<p>And so we now have the FCC of &quot;we will censor this and that&quot; and of &quot;we will revoke your license for this or that&quot; fame being entrusted with broad powers to regulate the internet, powers that could be legally used to do all sorts of things deemed abhorrent and restrictive of freedom but as to which the agency assures us it will use voluntary restraint in exercising.<p>This, I believe, is hardly a sure foundation upon which to base a long-term hope of assuring a free and open internet.<p>I do believe, given the political climate, that it will be a short-term solution for guaranteeing &quot;net neutrality,&quot; whatever that means exactly.<p>But, in our federal system, amid the various ways the idea of net neutrality might have been won and protected, the worst imaginable way from a conceptual standpoint is to say that internet freedom can best be guaranteed by giving broad discretionary power to bureaucrats to do what they will within the nebulous confines of a communications act enacted 80 years ago that did not even contemplate modern technology as we now know it. This is the very act that has been most characterized for decades now by an orgy of lobbying by one competitive group or interest or another to gain this or that advantage over others and whose crowning glory appears to rest in a mountain of endless litigation over what this or that may mean in the act.<p>I have purposely framed the above comments with multiple &quot;this or that&quot; references because that is the whole idea behind a nebulous bureaucratic framework: it can morph and shift in ways scarcely imaginable as time passes, as vested interests mount campaigns for their pet issues, and things get carved up by insiders with the nominal aim of protecting consumers but with the normal goal of carving up the booty for those who have the biggest stakes in the process.<p>Even in this thread (and many others like it), we already see vigorous debates over the meaning of this or that interpretation and of the motives behind them. This is all deemed safe for the moment because it is discussing an issue over which people are passionate, an issue which is right before us, and an issue over which each of us believes we have sound reasoning that ought to be adopted in the current debate.<p>But take that same process, extend it to a whole range of issues that the FCC might now address, add to the mix the vigorous energies of everybody and his uncle who has a stake in getting this or that competitive advantage on the issue, and then toss it to the courts to sort out who is right, well, you then have a lethal brew that in my view leaves us vulnerable to future abuse that is hardly trivial but affects the very essence of how a free and open internet ought to function.<p>Remember, you always believe the &quot;good guys&quot; will be in charge. But give enough unrestricted power to any governmental agency with very few checks on that power and the &quot;bad guys&quot; may then run wild with what you have done, much to your chagrin.<p>I realize this is a very unpopular position in this forum. But it has to be said. I truly hope I am wrong in my concerns.",1426180135

But everywhere you see social mobility, those are cases where people with little power slowly obtained success, which then turned to power.<p>Examples from the middle ages include grants of knighthood[1] as payment for some unusual service. While usually a knight would only come from wealthy or noble families (or at least a family with good connections) -- hence, from a position of some power -- sometimes knighthood was granted to brave foot soldiers -- i.e. people with little power. Sometimes, the title came with land (and the serfs that worked it, of course).<p>In non feudal societies, social mobility was usually achieved through money, although some classes were barred from obtaining any money whatsoever (slaves). You can see groups of immigrants, provided the host society did not block their steps too much, slowly gain money, and later recognition and connections. This process would often take several generations.<p>Analyzing those processes is helped by the fact that often you can observe power directly. Money and nobility titles are very conspicuous forms of power, easily measurable directly. More hidden forms of power such as connections can also be traced directly (a boy of low background would be taken to the home of a merchant as a gift to his parents in recognition of some service; this lets you trace connections across classes); charisma (which in the middle ages was a great way to attain power in religious circles) could be seen in some extraordinary ascetic acts[2] or visions[3]. The latter was one of the few ways women could rise to positions of power in medieval societies (see Joan of Arc), although others would be marrying, and surviving, a man of power. While it was often expected of widows to remarry, some medieval societies were surprisingly relatively accepting widows, recognized their independence, and allowed them to transact on their own.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.lordsandladies.org/steps-to-knighthood.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lordsandladies.org/steps-to-knighthood.htm</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Stylites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Stylites</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Brocadelli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Brocadelli</a>",1426179622

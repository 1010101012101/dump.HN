On the one hand it's useful enough that I still use it, but on the other it's pretty hideous. The XSLT looks for special XML elements representing characters that will need to be escaped for either LaTeX or HTML, like <underline/> and <amp/>.

Every country benefits from immigrants.<p>But if you're going to encourage entrepreneur immigrants, you should be open to anyone with a business plan, and enough experience and minimal personal assets necessary to make the business a success.<p>Since this is difficult to determine, don't try to determine it.

""the dot com boom"" there was a severe shortage of corporate lawyers in Silicon Valley due to the deal work exploding with record IPOs, M&A and VC activity etc.<p>Alongside the shortage, the cost of living in the Bay Area was rising which increased when there was an exodus of lawyers from law firms going to the Bay Area for in-house opportunities at startups. As a result to combat this, Law firms in SF/LA increased their associates pay which was then being matched throughout the rest of the country.<p>Once this happened it resulted in the increased wages leading to the prices at the level they are because:<p>- Noone wants to cut their wages - companies also do anything they can to prevent wage cuts even if that means reducing headcount.<p>- Law firms prestige are linked to money - in order to attract the best talent they compete on price by paying the highest starting salaries and bonuses. Likewise in order to keep the rest of the employees motivated they pay the same salaries across departments. Thus they then had to tackle the issue of the increase overheads so law firms increased their rates to manage increased overheads and to increase profitability of the firm ensuring they keep their best talent around.<p>However, with that said the reason lawyers are expensive despite the ""oversupply"" of them is because if you require a law firm with experience that is able to handle complex litigation, transactions etc and is able to allocate a significant amount of man-hours at your case then you're going to have to compensate them in order to do so.<p>So to answer the question are lawyers expensive, they're not.

People here obviously think I'm pretty snarky and a bit of an asshole and I'm fine with that, but I don't generally write comments singling people who disagree with me out by name and demanding that some circumstance of their career or status or upbringing requires them to agree with me at their own moral peril. I wish you could just disagree with me objectively.<p>Calling arguments I've made ""nonsense"" and ""ignorance"" doesn't make your argument stronger. It makes you sound emotional. That can be an effective card to play if you think your emotions are going to cow your opponent into shutting up. Is that what you're trying to do?<p>Moving on, you haven't addressed my point at all. URLs are human readable. We test a couple hundred web applications in any given year. How many ridiculous URLs do you think I've seen? I provided specific examples: human-readable URLs that human-readably gave up whole filesystems. Human-readable URLs that human-readably gave up SQL queries. Human-readable URLs that human-readably gave up private messages.<p>To follow your logic to its reasonable conclusion, all those vulnerable URLs were open season for Internet attacker^H^H^H^H^H^H^Husers; shame on those companies for over-exposing resources in URLs and then expecting the legal system to clean up after them! If that's what you believe, fine, but you're arguing for the decriminalization of a whole lot of very damaging attacks. And to what end? I guess my bill rate would go way up when people realized they had even less recourse against exploitation of bugs in their system.<p>Meanwhile, you've followed my logic to an improper conclusion. As Rayiner has tried to explain on numerous threads, the legal system is not a programming environment that evaluates objectively observable facts and spits out conclusions based solely on them. Crimes are (i) an intent to break the law and (ii) actions in furtherance of that attempt. It is not illegal to ""ask for the next book in a series"". But if an abortion clinic used a case management application with a bug that disclosed --- via human-readable URL --- the identities of all its patients, it absolutely should be a crime to use those URLs to dump confidential patient information to Pastebin.<p>None of this means I think Aurenheimer deserves prison time for getting email addresses from AT&T. He was charged with identity theft, in part (I think) because the CFAA has a badly written 1-up mushroom clause that says computer fraud is extra bad when charged alongside another felony. The idea that email addresses of iPad subscribers constitute ""identities"" is ludicrous.",1359069494

5112886,comment,5112094,5112660,25,0,nagrom,,,"None of it is easy. I haven't read this particular paper, but I have worked on similar experiments. First, you have to create muons and then isolate them in the particle beam and this costs quite some money (typically fire accelerated protons at a target and allow the pions and other decay products to be dumped in some dumb absorber that the muons pass through). Then you have to capture the muons into orbits around protons that come from hydrogen that needs to be disassociated and ionised. Then you have to pulse the hydrogen with a laser and excite the muon into a new energy state and accurately measure the energy of the photons that come off in the decay. You almost certainly need subnanosecond accuracy in your timing at this point. Of course, you can never be absolutely certain what you're measuring in any particular event so you sum over millions of events and average. And you have to simulate the whole thing (typically using a C++ framework called GEANT running on massive processor farms analysed with a horror-show of an analysis toolkit called ROOT) to see what could go wrong and determine the possible sources of error and uncertainty in your measurement.<p>To get the money to do this, you have to apply for government grants that may take up to a year to get approved. And no government wants to fund it so you need an 'in' with the lab, because they'll be the ones that sponsor your application for it to have a chance of success, and you'll need to know people from a whole load of other countries to collaborate with and prove your <i>bona fides</i>. And the people writing all these grant applications and doing most of the middle management are distracted by teaching literally hundreds of students every week during term time, so they can't even work full-time on it.<p>There are other experimental ways of doing this (e.g. measure correlated form factors and parton distribution functions from elastic scattering and extrapolate to zero momentum transfer), but they're all harder. They'll probably be done within the next 30 years. Probably. This particular effort is likely the work of 30-50 PhDs working for five or more years (at 50% of the salary they'd earn working for commercial companies), discounting any of the commercially available technology like electronics developed by CAEN or detector components developed by the likes of ElJen or Hamamatsu. And I would be surprised if they didn't mint another 10-15 PhDs during the effort. And I haven't covered the highly trained technicians and electronic engineers that are usually needed to build a lot of the custom experimental equipment.",1359069376

He is charging me $100/hr, which seems like a lot, but the hours he quoted for the full project were very reasonable.  However, need some contractual work for the same company and have a friend who is a partner at a major law firm in the Valley & he charges close to $700/hr.   He is very bright and hard working, but can anything justify $700/hr.  What am I missing?",1359068611

5112834,comment,5109788,5112768,4,0,ScottWhigham,,,"That's just not true. In fact, I wouldn't agree with a single statement you just made. An Apogee mic is good but there's a reason he used a $3500 mic + $20,000 more in gear. For you to say that a $200 mic would have achieved the same results is just utter crap. If that was the case, no one would use a professional studio and, instead, would buy said $200 MiC and be done with it.<p>And wait - you think that his fans, the ones paying $0.99 for the song, are going to pay $40,000 for his gear? Sheesh - I have to believe that you're just talking to hear yourself talk at that point.<p>The resell value on mics is no different than anything else except in one regard: it's much, much harder to tell fakes in mics, and it's much harder to detect problems in mics than it is with other gear. With a guitar, it's easy - does it play well, stay in tune, feel good, and have no scratchy pots? Then it's good. With an amp, does it sound good? Is it loud? Any scratchy pots? When you tap the tubes, are any microphonic? But with a mic - it's much trickier. You pretty much have to send it to the manufacturer for them to tell you whether it is ""right"".<p>That being said, buying and selling used microphones is the way to go for most hobbyists. You can buy said Neumann U87 for $2500 used thus potentially saving $1000. As long as it doesn't need to be reconditioned, you've done well.",1359068526

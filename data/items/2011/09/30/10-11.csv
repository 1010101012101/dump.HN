My point is that a very small minority of programmers is doing system programming. And if you're not part of that minority, software <i>isn't</i> at all as bad as Dahl describes. In fact, it got super many enablers for free, without many corresponding headaches, over the last 10 years or so. There are a lot of real decent high level tools.<p>Most of the Java ecosystem is open source, btw, and it has comparably easy high level tools as Visual Studio / .NET. Eclipse and NetBeans are real decent and open source, and so are Maven and all tooling for the cool JVM languages (i.e. not Java). I don't think my point applies to proprietary platforms like .NET only.<p>In fact Node is quickly becoming an equally cool platform. Big load of open source libraries, robust and dependable core engine, thriving community, excellent package management, etc. Nothing there to hate.<p>I daresay Ryan Dahl hates software for us so we don't have to.",1317379392

We have a large amount of different layers. Gigantic amounts of interfaces inheriting from interfaces, and being passed around as parameters. Partial classes, with implementation spread out all around the application. Everything grandly designed according to design patterns, and every piece of code positioned in the smallest possible unit. <i>Everything</i> in the front end is a user control.<p>In theory this gives us extreme extensibility, flexibility and code reuse. From an academics stand point, it's well designed according to best practice.<p>In reality, it is completely and utterly obfuscating the actual code that get things done. Adding another db field to the UI requres modification of data-access layer, business object layer, changes to 2-3 different types of interfaces, additional code to a type conversion class, initialization code in the front-end, additional display logic to a user control, extra custom validation logic etc etc.<p>I really feel with the author, and can unfortunately confirm it's often the same shit no matter what software you are dealing with.",1317378777

If you are installing many servers you should have this part automated. And ti shouldn't be meaningless either. I think you are doing it wrong.<p><i>> Once upon a time, I could use the well known admin login 'root'.</i><p>You still can. root login can always be reenabled if you want it that badly.

There are studies that prove the fact that many who get this kind of condition are usually heavier or they are already suffering from an underlying condition. The most difficult part about sleep apnea is the fact that this can go on for many years without being detected. The reason that it is so hard to detect is because patients who have this disease do not show any signs or symptoms while they are awake. There are two things that could tell you that it is time to find for sleep apnea cures and this is when you suffer from being generally tired in the morning and if people tell you that you snore severely at night.",1317377540

Rewriting performance critical parts is a lot of work, and not having to rewrite a corpus reader, tree transformations, or evaluation procedure is an advantage; aside from being an excellent prototype platform. With Cython you can seamlessly combine Python code such as that from NLTK with your own optimized code. This was indeed never the intention of NLTK, but I have found the general idea of combining arbitrary Python code with optimized Cython code to work very well. The end result is a much less bloated code base in comparison to something like Java or C++.",1317377221

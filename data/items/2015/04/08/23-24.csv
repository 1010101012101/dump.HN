If you think you haven&#x27;t encountered it, you probably haven&#x27;t actually checked your files closely enough – this is particularly easy to miss with things like video or image formats which were designed to tolerate a few bit-flips.<p>The reason why so many Mac users were interested in ZFS was that a modern filesystem incorporates strong integrity checks so you are guaranteed to either read back the bytes you originally wrote or get an error. That&#x27;s a much better way to work than requiring you to use a tool which does strong hashes periodically to see if anything has broken.",1428537581

Because you assumed the sex of someone in an article and ended up being wrong? This doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone, I suspect. I don&#x27;t believe that the positive energy in the ether is going to suffer a net loss because some people made this assumption either.<p>But it&#x27;s not just that, feeling bad about about assuming the incorrect sex of an author and recognizing a simple mistake. This can be seen in the fact that one poster even went so far as to describe their assumption  and one of another user&#x27;s as being &#x27;sexist&#x27;, which it most likely is not.  Someone said it best earlier, so I&#x27;m just going to quote them,<p>&#x27;Making an assumption about someones gender, race, age, etc based on what is most common (or most common to you) does not make you a sexist, racist or agist. It just makes you human.&#x27;<p>When presented with a faceless author and no hints of their sex or appearance, its pretty typical for one to fill in the blanks in their mind. The picture they come up with will be informed by all the experiences that they have encountered in their lifetimes. Simply being wrong doesn&#x27;t suggest any ill will, belief of inequality, discrimination, or prejudices towards or against any group of people.  Whoops seems like a level headed response, Oh shit I&#x27;m being sexist seems like a bit of an exaggeration<i>.<p></i> Although it totally could be case, and kudos to someone who suddenly has the self realization that they&#x27;re a sexist and wants to post about it.",1428537440

Whether it&#x27;s right or wrong to make money off it... I don&#x27;t know.<p>But I can feel both sides.<p>For example my favourite all time PC game is Heroes of Might and Magic (2 and 3). There is a wonderful &quot;inspired-by&quot; version called PalmHeroes, and then some open source projects (freeheroes and others).<p>And then I won&#x27;t mind paying for the latest version UbiSoft released for iPad&#x27;s - and it seems that version was just the DOS version emulated on the iPad (okay, maybe not, but felt that way).<p>But I was satisfied nonetheless. Playing heroes on the iPad is great.<p>Ah well, I don&#x27;t really have saying in such matters - maybe movies/books can help a bit in this direction.<p>.....<p>Now one thing that is possibly worrying - is how current games are going to be emulated in the future. It used to be that next-gen games were able to play previous games (PC, console) or emulate them, but PS3/Xbox360 are already hard to emulate on PC (especially PS3) - wondering with even newer consoles...<p>And then that&#x27;s even minor, what&#x27;s more worrying if the game relies on external assets/services (fully online games) - then nothing could be done really....",1428537396

Make it some exponential function, so that after a certain number of years, holding onto the rights to some IP is just too expensive to maintain unless the holders feel they can actually do something good and profitable with the IP (rather than a system that would need to show regular &quot;use&quot;, which would incentivize publishing crap to satisfy a regulation).",1428537261

Afterwards we had a big A3 piece of paper with notes, graphs and formulas all over it, which he took home with him.<p>Two weeks later I met him again, of course I wanted to continue teaching him. I thought maybe the Z^4+C variant would be a nice step further. Turns out he already had written the Julia version of the zoomer ... on his Android phone, while waiting at the dentist&#x27;s ... O_o<p>Now I used to be all about fractals when I was his age, later grew up to be a 4096 byte democoder (around 2000), I was sooo jealous, what I wouldn&#x27;t have given for a pocket computer <i>that</i> powerful! Lucky kid :)<p>Aaanyway, apart from sharing this cute anecdote, my point is this. There&#x27;s some extremely clever young bastards out there. Now there&#x27;s not many, but they&#x27;re also not extremely rare. I know a handful, although this particular guy is probably the cleverest right now. They come from all sorts of backgrounds, too. But the important part is not that they&#x27;re highly educated, but that they&#x27;re highly <i>educatable</i>, and given the opportunity to develop this. Their little hacker brains are hungry enough :)<p>Having written their own graphics code, running against CPU-limits (although we hit float precision before it got really slow), I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d appreciate some of the awesomeness of stunts on a limited machine like the 8088. In fact one of the earlier graphics I programmed with him was something very similar to the circle interference pattern described in the article (it was mostly his own idea, playing with interference patterns, I just carefully nudged towards the classic demo effect, because I knew it&#x27;d result in a really cool effect).<p>[0] He already knew how to draw stuff with Processing. He already tried to look online for how the Mandelbrot algorithm works, but couldn&#x27;t quite wrap his head around it. Missing bit of information turned out to be (a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd, hadn&#x27;t learned that in school yet. If you explain i as rotation by 90 degrees, the rest becomes quite intuitive, visually.

After not hearing from them for 2 days, I sent an email and they got back to me saying that due to a clerical error, it was actually out of stock and wouldn&#x27;t be shipping out for another 4 days. Meanwhile, the website still listed the part as in stock. They didn&#x27;t care, what&#x27;s the worst I could punish this retailer for? Denying them all of my future spare fridge part purchases?<p>Sure, there&#x27;s always exceptions to be found in all of these areas but by being the exception, you relegate yourself to a niche of the market and it becomes hard to expand outside of that niche.",1428535668

Incredibly unlikely statistical events happen all the time in finance.<p>A great read on an alternative view on the topic of using statistics for finance is The (Mis)Behavior of Markets by Benoit Mandlebrot [1]. It&#x27;s very well written, basic enough for most to comprehend and first book on finance I read in college (before I went on to major in finance + math).<p>The aforementioned book has some very interesting notions with Trading Time being my favorite. Basically one can near-perfectly &quot;forge&quot; financial data with fractal objects called &quot;financial cartoons&quot; [2]. The objects are composed to two distinct fractals - one for price vs trading time and another for trading time vs clock time [3]. The latter rescales the volatility seen former, either compressing or expanding it. Rescaling volatility isn&#x27;t a new idea, but it was a parallel &quot;discovery&quot;.<p>There has been some work on figuring out how to use Fractal Geometry to analyze financial time series data but it&#x27;s still in its infancy. The problem is figuring out how to transform the data into the fractals domain + figuring out what the results from a fractal based analysis would mean for forecasting future events. I&#x27;ve been working on these problems for many years (in earnest in college and as a hobby thereafter) but made little true progress.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Misbehavior-Markets-Financial-Turbulence/dp/0465043577"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Misbehavior-Markets-Financial-Turb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/randfrac/Market/Fake/Fake.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/randfrac/Market/Fake/Fake.h...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/randfrac/Market/TradingTime/TradingTime.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/randfrac/Market/TradingTime...</a>",1428535432

But given that we&#x27;re dealing with Mark Pincus, the founder famous for wanting control, I guess this was expected.<p>To those who are unaware, Mattrick was primarily let go for his failure with Zynga Poker. The updated version killed user engagement so badly, the game may never recover. Zynga Poker is one of the company&#x27;s most interesting assets, given that online gambling will be legalized in the next few years.<p>Mattrick represented a shift in Zynga: instead of low-brow clones of competitors, Zynga would focus on high-polish triple AAA games. It was a daring strategy, since Zynga&#x27;s reputation single handedly scared away many amazing game designers. You can copy a farming game easily and get decent results if you have a team of data analysts. It is quite difficult to copy a great hardcore RTS and get good results. Zynga spent 500 million USD to buy NaturalMotion, an excellent game developer in this space. They spent a ton of money on their slots game, acquiring valuable IP licenses + great slot designers. They spent a ton of money getting the Tiger Woods license. Etc etc.<p>Pincus has never shown the ability to manage high quality game designers. He has only showed the ability to manage MBA-types, who aren&#x27;t considered the most creative of the bunch. Mattrick would have been a better leader in this vertical. Any midcore/hardcore gamer would rather want the XBOX CEO over Pincus.<p>What does this signal for Zynga&#x27;s future?<p>1) All of Mattrick&#x27;s high-polish products are now under the leadership of someone who isn&#x27;t as geared towards this vertical.<p>2) Increased importance for social casino and real money gambling for the company- The fact that this is the main reason why Mattrick got fired highlights Pincus&#x27; goal of dominating real money gambling.<p>#1 is a negative signal, #2 is a positive signal.

Doing exactly the same job under Engineering in previous years won me maybe a few thousand dollar bonus, or one year <i>a gift card for dinner</i>.<p>Somehow companies don&#x27;t realize that you need everyone working as team to hit that revenue number at the end of the year, and every member of that team is doing essential work. You can have Customer Support rockstars, just like you can have Engineering and Sales rockstars. It&#x27;s just that the Sales rockstars are trivially easy to measure (<i>bookings</i>) and so much easier to reward. I have yet to read about a compelling solution to this, because a low-base / high-commission model is <i>proven</i> to attract and incentivize talented reps and drive out the low performers, and there just isn&#x27;t an equivalent process you can apply in the cost centers.<p>Not every employee wants or needs to be on variable comp, but the way we manage and reward employees is often very much dependent on how closely they are to driving revenue. I would be interested in case studies on companies that have managed to Think Differently on this, and I don&#x27;t just mean a &quot;profit sharing&quot; plan.",1428534849

Specifically, in the letter, Jamie Dimon 1) never uses the term &quot;flash crash&quot; and 2) spends the previous five paragraphs explaining exactly how and why liquidity dynamics in the fixed income markets have changed.<p>What he is saying is that the Oct 15th move looks really strange, but not if you actually understand how fixed income market makers are reacting to the Volker rule. Quoting Dimon:<p><i>For instance, the total inventory of Treasuries readily available to market-makers today is $1.7 trillion, down from $2.7 trillion at its peak in 2007. Meanwhile, the Treasury market is $12.5 trillion; it was $4.4 trillion in 2007.</i><p>What he&#x27;s saying is that market makers have smaller inventories on absolute terms, and much smaller inventories on relative terms, so when multiple big market participants try to move in the same direction at the same time, there is much less inventory available to soak up demand.",1428534770

Anecdotally, I find I could trust Dropbox&#x27;s backup model more than Apple&#x27;s because I understand it better.",1428534083

9344719,comment,9331597,9332969,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"The main reason that I am able to do without IDEs most of the time, is that it is uncommon for me to use debuggers anymore.<p>For the most part I use assertions.  Quite commonly all I require is to assert the validity of input parameters to subroutines.  Less commonly I do that for return values.  Uncommonly I use insertions somewhere in the middle.<p>Very rarely - but sometimes - I use class invariants.  That is, a circle class has an invariant that its radius is fixed all the way around; that&#x27;s not the case for ellipses.  However when I do use class invariants, they are very helpful.<p>I also use memory debuggers like guard malloc and valgrind.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t use step-through debuggers at all, but with all the above it is uncommon that I feel the need to.",1428534027

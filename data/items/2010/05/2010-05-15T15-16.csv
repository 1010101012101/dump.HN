The food's great, the economy's great, people are friendly if you try to understand the culture, cost of living is low, and there's plenty of interesting historical stuff all around. Not to mention it's a very fascinating time to be here as you can see the most populous nation on Earth rapidly undergoing social and technological change.<p>Just don't get so hung up on the politics and you'll find that the water's warm :)",1273939177

1350074,comment,1349923,1349923,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"My problem with the assertion in this article is I see technology creating an even greater need for the welfare state in the future.  So I see attempts to diminish it as being ultimately pointless.<p>Up to this point technology has created as many jobs as it's  replaced because it's enabled us to do more than we could before (much of the analysis computers now do in the financial market for example wasn't possible 20 years ago).<p>But that trend will eventually catch up to us.  Especially once robotics matures and starts replacing so-called ""unskilled labor"" jobs.  Think about it.  A single robot can replace at least 3 shifts of laborer (and probably 4 since it can work faster with no breaks).  Even with the increased need for maintenance personnel there's simply no way we'll create as many jobs as we lose.  Once that happens we're going to have an excess of people and they'll need to be given some means to live.<p>Which is why I disagree with this article.  For better or worse the welfare state is here to stay.  What we need to do is find a way to make it more efficient so it doesn't bankrupt us.",1273939131

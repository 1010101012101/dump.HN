These functions are everywhere and they keep us from doing all sorts of stupid things. Just think of your car. There is, for instance, the reverse lockout, which prevents us from throwing a moving car into reverse and accidentally ripping apart the transmission.<p>>  whatever I write will be fact-checked and fully footnoted.<p>I was interested in learning more about this ""reverse lockout.""  From the Wikipedia entry [1] which is the top Google result for ""reverse lockout"" (I typed it into Google without quotes):<p>> a forcing function or poka-yoke, is a technique used in error-tolerant design to prevent the user from making common errors or mistakes. One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving automobile.<p>I don't want to spend time researching this further, but it's interesting that he came up with the same name and example of the concept as the Wikipedia article (without attribution).  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be secondary sources -- ""original research"" is an explicitly discouraged category of content.  But none of the links cited by the Wikipedia article mention ""forcing function.""<p>So here's someone, writing a <i>mea culpa</i> about his past plagiarism, who uses a phrase and idea without proper footnoting of it (nebulously crediting ""designers"" with the idea); and a single Google search for the idea turns up a Wikipedia article which also mentions the idea without citing a source!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-shaping_constraint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-shaping_constraint</a>",1360803594

We were paying for their (new at the time) critical app support, and I brought up that it appears to be failing at a routing level continuously. And this was with a Sinatra app served by Unicorn (which at the time at least was considered unsupported).<p>We went with a metal cluster setup and everything ran super smooth.

5216877,comment,5212543,5215523,1,0,lutusp,,,"> So the starting offset between the cycles is highly important!<p>You're missing something basic here. The program's starting point is irrelevant because it's modeling a natural continuous process, one that stretches out to infinity in the past and the future (sort of like an indefinite integral). So there isn't a ""starting point"" in nature, only in these models.<p>And, because I model all the predator cycles between 1 and 30 in order to get a single result for one experimental cicada cycle, and because I model 1000 years, I have eliminated the starting point from consideration.<p>In nature, some predators are born in year 1, some in year 2 and so forth. Some predators have a 2-year reproductive cycle, some 3, and so forth. Those two factors are independent, and one of them answers the objection you're making (the arbitrary starting point).<p>But to make sure we're on the same page, here's my latest algorithm:<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/7m8hq9yzcu5nztx/prime_reproduction_test.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7m8hq9yzcu5nztx/prime_reproduction...</a><p>Note that I changed the basic algorithm to agree with that used in my Web page. It doesn't change the result, but it's perhaps easier to understand.<p>This version arbitrarily adds a random number 0 <= cr <= 99 to the starting year of the predator on each test, much like your original code except that my way of doing it ""wraps around"" within the period determined by variable b. This effort to randomize things doesn't change the result rankings -- primes always come out ahead (in the sense of fewer collisions between predators and cicadas).<p>Sample output:<p><pre><code>     2 =     18 ******************\n     3 =     18 ******************\n     4 =     25 *************************\n     5 =     16 ****************\n     6 =     41 *****************************************\n     7 =     18 ******************\n     8 =     37 *************************************\n     9 =     29 *****************************\n    10 =     45 *********************************************\n    11 =     20 ********************\n    12 =     52 ****************************************************\n    13 =     20 ********************\n    14 =     33 *********************************\n    15 =     33 *********************************\n    16 =     38 **************************************\n    17 =     19 *******************\n    18 =     57 *********************************************************\n    19 =     25 *************************\n    20 =     56 ********************************************************\n    21 =     32 ********************************\n    22 =     37 *************************************\n    23 =     21 *********************\n</code></pre>\nThe present form is just one of many variations I tried. I used random numbers to tweak various starting points, all with the same outcome -- primes are always favored. Because modulo arithmetic is being used, one needs to add random numbers carefully, with a clear understanding of their effect.",1360803381

You'd think that Heroku would continue to support the routing model that almost all of their marketing and documentation advertises, right?  Even if it's a configurable option, and it only works usefully with single-threaded servers?<p>And if you did do it pull-based, it wouldn't be Heroku's problem to decide how many concurrent requests to send.  Leave it to the application (or whatever you call the thing you run on a dyno).<p>And it doesn't need to be pull-based, if the router can detect HTTP connections closing in dynos, or whatever.<p>But the idea of pull-based work distribution is pretty straightforward.

Should they be taught both at the same time seeing as both are present on the web at this time?<p>Or is it right to skip the old way and teach new students the HTML5 way, in order that they have a simpler introduction which best prepares them for the future?<p>Any thoughts/comments/suggestions would be appreciated.<p>Also relevant to this discussion would be a cross-section of data showing browser usage statistics along with the HTML5 feature support of those browsers, so we can look at the percentage of web users that already have support for basic HTML5 features.<p>If this number seems sufficient - it will only increase over time - we might not consider it to be that important for a new student of HTML to learn the old way. Any pointers to where such data can be found to asses these statistics would be appreciated as well.",1360802989

5216840,comment,5213241,5216533,4,0,saurik,,,"So, I just spent some time digging around in these libraries, to figure out where I might be wrong about this, and it seems like this is my mistake: a bunch of functionality I thought was in WebKit is actually in the closed-source parts of WebCore. Specifically, I'm talking about the tiled rendering (TileCache.mm) and all of the multitouch logic (PlatformTouchEventIPhone.mm). Even simple things like the copy/paste support are redacted, as is scrolling (yes: scrolling). For other platforms, all of this code is available.<p>This closed source part contains tons of simply critical things, such as how to interact with the iPhone's memory management notification system, how to manage the network state transitions, how to interact with embedded video... pretty much everything about MobileSafari that makes it MobileSafari as opposed to a less-than-half-operational desktop version of Safari with a touch screen (which would suck) is closed source.<p>I'm therefore quite sorry that I thought that this stuff was in the other library, but my point about the ""open source and forkable"" stands, and I think it stands pretty well: I can't fork WebCore and make meaningful changes to it for this system. In fact, even for people who have access to the system's internals (we jailbreak users), the few people who used to recompile WebCore for it (the Hebrew community) gave up and moved to writing Substrate extensions instead.<p>To be clear: I consider these iOS-specific things to be ""the juicy parts"" of MobileSafari: if you want to compete, you have to have really strong <i>compatible</i> answers for them. It isn't sufficient to take a desktop copy of WebKit and recompile it, because if you did that you'd just have a totally unusable browser experience... you wouldn't even have as much functionality as embedding a UIWebView in your application and attempting to externally script it.<p>So, yes: you are right that these are in WebCore, and that my complaint about ""WebCore != WebKit"" was wrong. The reason I made that argument was to try to reconcile your insistence that WebKit for iOS was open source with the reality that there really is no source code available from Apple for anything but ""something that renders HTML (slowly, and missing features)""; my reconciliation was wrong, but the reason for it is still correct: WebKit for iOS, including WebCore, is not ""open source and forkable"" enough to make a web browser.<p>To the extent to which one can then put in the elbow grease to add back all of these missing parts in order to make a web browser, honestly one may as well be starting with any other rendering engine that isn't yet ported to this platform. Therefore, if WebKit for desktop systems is relevant to this discussion, then Gecko being open source is equally as relevant and libcurl in general being open source is largely as relevant. You can also build web browsers out of those.<p>Given this, I'm having an increasingly difficult time trying to figure out where your correction to kenjackson's argument was: you tried to give him a different way to think about it (in a way that might undermine his argument that WebKit is a defacto implementation due to an inability to install your own copy on iOS), but it is starting to seem like you just agree with him? Am I simply misunderstanding why you were responding to him?",1360802974

The 1st thing any worker does  before any other IO/DB/net-intensive work  would be to check if the dyno is 'loaded', defined as all other workers (perhaps just one, for workers=2) on the same dyno already being engaged. If so, the request is redirected to a secondary hostname, getting random assignment to a (usually) different dyno.<p>The result: fewer big pileups unless completely saturated, and performance approaching smart routing but without central state/queueing. There is an overhead cost of the redirects... but that seems to fit the folk wisdom (others have also shared elsewhere in thread) that a hit to average latency is worth it to get rid of the long tails.<p>(Also, perhaps Heroku's routing mesh could intercept a dyno load-shedding response, ameliorating pile-ups without taking the full step back to stateful smart balancing.)<p><i>Added:</i> On even further thought: perhaps the Heroku routing mesh automatically tries another dyno when one refuses the connection. In such a case, you could set your listening server (g/unicorn or similar) to have a minimal listen-backlog queue, say just 1 (or the number of workers). Then once it's busy, a connect-attempt will fail quickly (rather than queue up), and the balancer will try another random dyno. That's as good as the 1-request-per-dyno-but-intelligent-routing that RapGenius wants... and might be completely within RapGenius's power to implement without any fixes from Heroku.",1360801975

I merely stated that if you offered the same care for lower prices, you would have no shortage of customers. In addition, when there is competition between hospitals, a patient can choose one that has a lower incidence of return visits, for example.<p>Demand is <i>always</i> an issue - in this case, high demand and a tightly limited supply have resulted in astronomical pricing. We can't really affect demand, other than to cure various diseases, but we can easily affect supply by easing the intense regulation and government-mandated licensing monopoly.<p>I also never said that hospitals ought to be for-profit (though I wouldn't suggest outlawing for-profit hospitals, either). There are many advantages to a non-profit approach, and non-profits do <i>not</i> have to have the government's support to exist. I am only arguing that the government should get out of the issue, except when it comes to judicial matters of crime or civil suits. An organization can have a motivation other than profit - many do. Many organizations (the Red Cross, for instance) would be more than happy if they were unneeded and obsolete. I realize there are certainly some corrupt people who would try to use their position for unjust personal gain, but this is always the case, and would become harder to do than under the current model, not easier.<p>(As a very firm Christian, I tend towards the idea that the best model for hospitals is to be managed by the church (e.g., the numerous and beneficial Catholic hospitals around the country), which would be in line with what I previously said about non-profits, though I realize I am probably nearly alone in that opinion on this forum. I don't believe that secular hospitals should be outlawed and all hospitals should be required to be church hospitals, merely that church hospitals are the best model.)<p>Regardless, my point wasn't really to argue the free market position in this case.

5216641,comment,5215884,5216385,7,0,jholman,,,"Re the distribution, absolutely.  That ""FIFTY TIMES"" is totally due to the width of the distribution.  Although, you know, even if their app was written such that every single request took exactly 100ms of dyno time, this random routing would create the problem all over again, to some degree.<p>As for the intelligent routing, could you explain the problem?  The goal isn't to predict which request will take a long time, the goal is to not give more work to dynos that already have work.  Remember that in the ""intelligent"" model it's okay to have requests spend a little time in the global queue, a few ms mean across all requests, even when there are free dynos.<p>Isn't it as simple as just having the dynos pull jobs from the queue?  The dynos waste a little time idle-spinning until the central queue hands them their next job, but that tax would be pretty small, right?  Factor of two, tops?  (Supposing that the time for the dyno-initiated give-me-work request is equal to the mean handling time of a request.)  And if your central queue can only handle distributing to say 100 dynos, I can think of relatively simple workarounds that add another 10ms of lag every factor-of-100 growth, which would be a hell of a lot better than this naive routing.<p>What am I missing?",1360800320

5216631,comment,5215600,5215600,3,0,cantlin,,,"There's tremendous value in the history of a design file. Virtually every design agency I've worked for has had the need to write case studies based on work they've done. ""Showing your workings"" is also a powerful tool for demonstrating to clients the value for money they're getting. Finally, I can imagine such history being an invaluable aid for junior designers trying to learn from their seniors; it potentially transforms a nebulous process that is very hard to inspect (except by direct observation) into one that can be widely examined by distributed users.<p>What I'm unclear on is how the nitty gritty of the versioning actually operates. For example, most designers would attest to heading down many ""dead ends"" that may only ever live in RAM. Can services like this snapshot those interim states, or do they only capture changes to files on disc? Some experienced designers will also likely do their own primitive versioning by saving a design out to different paths as they go (home_v1.psd, home_v2.psd...). Can Pixelapse et al handle this user behaviour, or does it require people to change their workflow? If the latter, is an analogous feature available to allow designers to mark major version increments?<p>In many ways it ultimately feels that ""files in folders"" is a broken way to handle designs, units of design and design projects on a computer. I applaud attempts to supersede it. As long as Photoshop thinks in terms of files though, it will be a difficult space to innovate.",1360800226

I'm just arguing that it's only good in moderation.  The TSA is both too intrusive for the security they provide and extremely wasteful.  Back-scatter X-ray machines are a great example of this.  The first models used were not adequately tested and proved to be easily defeated.  The solution?

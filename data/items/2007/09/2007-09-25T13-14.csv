It's the same as accusing all managers of snorting coke and playing golf all the time or secretaries who sit on the phone all day to their friends while filing their nails.<p>If his work was due in and his computer wasn't working and support were refusing to fix it, wouldn't you escalate the issue?",1190727319

59389,comment,59033,59359,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>nowhere as easy to escape nor self-created nor eradicated as you suggest</i><p>Um, yes it is. 100 years ago almost everyone was ""poor"" by absolute standards. Today, almost no one is. Poverty has been all-but eradicated and it's something you almost have to aim for now.<p><i>And the income gap appears to only be getting worse</i><p>This is a make-believe problem. If I get a raise, the income gap has just increased (or decreased, depending). Whichever might occur doesn't change the basic advantage of getting a raise.<p><i>around 50k. Good luck trying to raise a family (food, car, rent/mortgage) and save for their education on that</i><p>Um, let's see...90 percent of the people I new growing up (actually much less than 50K), including my family, would fall in this category. So, you may have a very pampered sense of what is required to survive in this world, because it's totally foreign to me.<p><i>it's possible to redistribute wealth through a Horatio Alger ethos generation after generation</i><p>If that is your goal by itself, then a good mugging will do the job with much, much less in the way of administrative costs than redistributing money through a school system or some other structure. At any rate, the prices for schools are strictly nominal and are invariably lower for low-income students. This is just how schools segment the marketplace, and the fallacious sticker-price of schooling shouldn't distort one's view of society.<p><i>But fewer than 50% of the American populace goes on to attend</i><p>And fewer than 25 percent <i>should</i> attend. Your average person should enter vocational training rather than pretending to become a professional by spending 1000s of dollars on art history classes.",1190726350

59387,comment,59195,59195,0,0,rwebb,,,"Your Man in India (YMII) is actually a service designed for Indians in the US to use.  Brickworks is their task outsourcing business.  They are not taking on new customers right now because of all the interest caused by 4 Hour Work Week.  Get Friday is Brickworks' main competitor.  They currently take about 2 weeks to respond to an inquiry (in broken English) and you then have to give them you CC# and commit to a monthly minimum and wait another 3 weeks before you can try the service.  All reports I have seen have been very positive once the service starts, but I'm not holding my breath.  Ask Sunday is a start up that was offering a month of free tasks (or 30 tasks total) for free with promotional code ""beta"".  I use them for some business outsourcing stuff and have been quite good.  I bet they are going to start getting overloaded with demand as well.  <p>At the end of the day, for non-code business outsourcing (research, online tasks, etc.) the services don't save you that much money (US temp agencies are ~$18/hr - these Indian services are around ~$15).  And obviously the best type of tasks to outsource are repetitive homogeneous ones that don't require subjective decisions.<p>I blogged a bit about some of these services here:<p><a href=""http://blog.robwebb2k.com/2007/07/29/ask-sunday/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.robwebb2k.com/2007/07/29/ask-sunday/</a> ",1190726025

I spent more time trying to fix and work around its bugs than I would have building a VM from scratch, so eventually I gave up and went back to my plain VM. It&#x27;s great for trying stuff out, but anything that needs to work for more than one session was extremely problematic with a lot of networking problems that required destroying the VM and rebuilding it constantly.",1443470381

That keeps ownership to the people best know about it (the developers of a given service) instead of have that centralized.
But all this sounds very ambious.<p>I&#x27;m especially curious how to configure dependencies. You might need to creating tables in a database which is setup as a dependencies, but also need to support restoring from backups or setting up replication. Beside that, some of this configuration should belong to the owner of the service using the db (db names etc), other to the owner of the db (global server settings, limits etc).
To add to that, some configuration needs to happen at runtime, so you can&#x27;t just update the Appfile.<p>Anyway, this sounds like an awesome &quot;UX&quot; - let&#x27;s see how it plays out in reality.",1443470339

10292745,comment,10291666,10292651,0,0,Mz,,,"A) I did say up front that I wondered what the other numbers are that Sam is not putting in the article -- the other half of the picture. I have, in fact, read &quot;How to lie with statistics&quot; and I am well aware we are being intentionally given a certain framing from a party with a vested interest.<p>B) However, I also lived in the bay area at one time, in Solano County, and was pursuing education with an eye towards going into some kind of urban planning related career. In fact, I founded and moderated a subforum for a time on the most successful urban planning forum around at that time. So I have some familiarity with how crazy prices were back then, before AirBnB was a gleam in anyone&#x27;s eye. And also I have some familiarity with the various factors that go into forcing housing prices up. Saying AirBnB contributes to the problem is not crazy talk. But acting like they are the single most important factor meriting the passage of a bill intended to kill them off -- I want a tad more data than &quot;But look at the crazy high local housing prices, man!&quot; Because that falls far short of proving they are having that big of an effect.<p>C) Yeah, I am very familiar with the saying. I am well aware of how hard it is to be both profitable and ethical. So far, I have managed to be pretty ethical. I am also dirt poor. So I am a little tired of hearing that anyone making money is clearly The Devil. The fact that this is part of a pro AirBnB PR campaign does not ipso facto make it inherently evil. The other side is also engaging in a PR campaign, and they also have vested interest that you can put a dollar amount on. Sometimes, people are actually doing work they actually fucking believe in. Those people still need to EAT and put a roof over their head. I am so goddamn sick of the idea that all the good people are dead martyrs and, if you still draw breathe, you need to feel guilty about every single fucking thing you do to try to keep body and soul together.",1443470145

10292727,comment,10291372,10292348,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"There was a fascinating article about how visual art from contemporary artists gets valued. Essentially, you have a patronage system whereby galleries keep stables of artists and build brands out of their output. The galleries try their hardest to ensure that values climb steadily upward, and the rest of the industry tries their best to not rock the boat.<p>Auction houses throw a wrench into the works by allowing the market as a whole to weigh in. If an artwork gets sold at auction for significantly more or less than where it &quot;should&quot; be selling at, the whole system suffers. So the galleries representing the artists will bid on the artworks themselves and auctioneers will pretend that the piece was sold, to someone in the back, if it doesn&#x27;t meet the reserve.<p>The takeaway I got from it was that value of art is not and can never be intrinsic, somebody is acting as a taste-maker, but that somebody never has complete control over the market.<p>If you think about it, it&#x27;s not a whole lot different from other kinds of tradable good, (currency comes to mind) it&#x27;s just that there are far fewer external indicators of value, making it more difficult to operate rationally. There&#x27;s stability within the system, but the system is artificial and can seem rather arbitrary.",1443469986

Now within that method, you know that reference is never null, and don&#x27;t need to check it. When you call it, you have to either check for null beforehand, or pass something that is already guaranteed not to be null.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like it builds a wall between things that could be null, and things that can&#x27;t be, instead of having theoretical potential nulls all over your code.

A hotel business, no less, which <i>kind</i> of foists upon them the responsibilities of travel guides, as we read in an article this morning.<p>Now, as demand for housing in an area is shooting up, individual renters are leveraging that in a way that does not contribute to the cost of maintaining property, putting increased pressure on other tenants, and disallowing the landlord from actually satisfying that demand.<p>All that aside, AirBnb knows what the fuck they are doing.  I know at least one successful AirBnb host who has had AirBnb approach them and encourage them to rent up nearby apartments and turn them into new units!<p>San Francisco housing activists have asked time and time again for AirBnb to open up data about how many hosts have multiple units, and who is renting when not in their unit, so that data may be used over time to guide regulation, but as is becoming a trend with YC companies, private executives and investors feel that they can do better city planning than people who have decades or perhaps their entire lives invested in doing so.<p>Put up or shut the fuck up, sir.",1443468857

10292559,comment,10291621,10292170,0,0,jrockway,,,"I always seem to have my iPhone when I want my DSLR.<p>The iPhone&#x27;s metering is suspicious.  It seems to average all areas of the frame equally, resulting in underexposure when the background&#x27;s exposure is different from the exposure you&#x27;d use the capture the subject.  Of course this will always happen with any camera, by my A7ii seems to be very good at picking a correct exposure.  (Of course it has exposure compensation and manual mode, so I can always override its choice, which is all I really ask.)  You can see this demonstrated in the &quot;backlit&quot; photo with the article, I think the exposure could go up a little bit more to get some more detail from the shadowy clouds and the boat, with the only side effect of blowing that cloud out more.  (It&#x27;s already gone.)<p>I also think the iPhone&#x27;s sensor is capable of collecting more light data than Apple allows it to.  It is amazing how much dynamic range modern sensors pick up.  When I first got my A7ii I put it into auto bracket mode.  By default it does something like -1/3, 0, +1/3.  This adds no data.  After some more testing, even at +3, 0, -3, you can still recover the other two exposures from any one of the others with no significant loss of detail.  So I don&#x27;t bracket anymore and I&#x27;ve never had to throw away a picture because of the exposure.<p>That said, that is all with RAW files that capture data that can&#x27;t be visible in the JPEG.  The iPhone tone maps all that data to make a JPEG, and its tone mapping works differently than how I&#x27;d manually do it in lightroom.  The RAW files off my camera capture so much data that you can ridiculously under- or over-expose and still get something that looks nice on the computer screen.  (Not as perfect for the pixel-peepers as the correct exposure of course, but something that would look fine on your wall at 8x10 or shared to G+.)  The iPhone&#x27;s JPEGs are unfixable in Lightroom, the data isn&#x27;t there and all you can do is make bright stuff brighter or dark stuff darker, which you almost never want to do.<p>Finally, based on EXIF data, I&#x27;ve found that the iPhone chooses some oddball exposure settings, using overly-fast shutter speeds at high ISOs when it could use a fine shutter speed at a fine ISO to get the same exposure.  But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s optimized for how people normally use their phone&#x27;s cameras, not for whatever I happen to be shooting at the moment.  I know the interplay between ISO, aperture, and shutter speed.  Most people just want a picture of their friend eating dinner.  And to be fair, the A7ii on auto-ISO + P mode will choose oddball exposures too.  1/8000s at ISO 32000?  Back in my day, we were happy when we had ISO 400 film :P<p>So anyway, the iPhone camera is disappointing on a technical level, but the best camera is the one you have with you, so I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;d rather have an imperfect picture than no picture at all.",1443468779

You may have a roommate anyway, but this just lets you cycle them out daily/weekly/monthly.  Plus, if the person is bad/rude/evil, you have to deal with them as well as your neighbors.  You&#x27;ve got skin in the game.<p>The fast-flux roommate thing gets shady when the owner says &quot;i&#x27;ll just sleep on the couch while you visit&quot; or other variations of not really having enough room for a roommate, but making do.  A lot of listings have that weird dynamic.<p>The <i>second</i>, and more damaging, part of the AiRbNb story is when people become management companies and rent a dozen or a hundred apartments in a city to be 100% aIrBnB units.  That is where real problems start.  Rent apartments for $2,000 per month on a yearly lease then turn around and market them as short-term rentals for $200 per night.  It&#x27;s so common there are multiple concierge startups focused around cleaning and key-providing for short term sharing economy rentals taken out of the local for-natives housing supply.  It&#x27;s so common there are routine &#x27;airbnb lies&#x27; your bookings are supported to tell to all the neighbors or doorman or building security if they get asked who they are (oh, I&#x27;m Sally&#x27;s cousin!!!)<p>(oh, and the <i>third</i> way, a middle ground between the first two, is when you rent out your apartment just while you&#x27;re on vacation or whatnot.  This is more of a traditional sublet scenario, just facilitated by an evil megacorp who charges too many fees.

We don&#x27;t recommend deploying for anything more than demos. Future versions of Otto _are_ going to make this production-ready though, and we already have plans in place to do so.<p>* As others have discovered, Otto is built on top of our other tools and executes them under the hood. We didn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel, and this has huge benefits. We&#x27;re dedicated to making all our tools better, and as we do, Otto naturally improves as well.<p>* Otto is a lot of magic, we&#x27;re not trying to hide that. It is a magical tool. But we also give you access to the details (OS, memory, etc.) using &quot;customizations.&quot; We&#x27;ll improve customizations and increase the number of knobs over time.<p>* Vagrant development will continue, we have some major Vagrant releases planned. Please see this page for more info: <a href=""https://ottoproject.io/intro/vagrant-successor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ottoproject.io/intro/vagrant-successor.html</a><p>* Remember that Otto is 0.1 today and Vagrant is 6 years old. We have a long way to go to reach the maturity and toughness of Vagrant. We&#x27;re committed to make that happen, but it will take time.<p>Thanks everyone, sorry for not being able to be more active in here. Have a great day!",1443467779

Vagrant Push [4] requires a little bit too much overhead for this audience. The blog announcement even admits this.

With that reclassification, their data seems to show that US-based research (though not necessarily US-headquartered companies) substantially outperforms EU-based research both in quantity of NMEs and sales.<p>> At first glance, the organizations with their headquarters based in European countries are characterized by a higher probability of market launch for compounds entering clinical development. However, when the composition of research portfolios is taken into account, the apparent comparative advantage of European organizations vanishes.<p>Your second link seems to reinforce this:<p>> The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations reported that, between 1990 and 2003, its members increased their research and development investments in Europe by 2.6-fold and in the US by fourfold<p>It&#x27;s obviously silly to claim that <i>all</i> research has fled Europe (it clearly has not), but it does seem evident that European-based pharma countries are electing to research and bring to market first in the US. I think the question then is &quot;why?&quot; - is it the US&#x27;s higher effective ceiling on drug prices? Higher per-capita drug spending? Higher probability of success through the FDA versus the EMA? What are the causes, and what are the effects?<p>Economic wisdom tells us that long-term price controls reliably cause shortages, either by underpricing demand and/or by disincentivizing supply; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to presume that the same effect would be in play to some degree here. The pharma industry is obviously extremely distorted by regulatory intervention, both in barriers to entry for a new product and barriers to entry for competition on existing products, so conventional wisdom can&#x27;t be applied across the board, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the effects of price controls are negligible.",1443467274

Can&#x27;t some people value the gain in efficiency, or whatever else the feature provides more than the cost?<p>If you work alone, you&#x27;re right. Problems start when working in a team. The average lifetime of a codebase is about a decade, in which time it is read and touched by many hands, and falls under several management administrations. We know that languages that are too feature-rich can prove troublesome under these conditions.<p>> sounds suspiciously subjective<p>Of course its&#x27;s subjective -- like many things that have to do with the choice of languages -- but unlike many other debates, we actually have some very good data on this: C++. For a few years, C++ was considered a blessing. Expressive, sophisticated, powerful. But after a few years, as codebases started to mature, the industry as a whole discovered that maintaining C++ codebases is a nightmare. Every team had its own style and its own subset of features it chose to use. Some features (like operator overloading and esp. cast and assignment operators) while useful, ended up making long-lasting, large-project collaboration extremely costly. Java&#x27;s design was very much a reaction to C++, eliminating features right and left, and declaring from the get-go that it aims to be <i>less</i> expressive and more verbose. It worked. The question now is whether any new &quot;rich&quot; language would share C++&#x27;s troubles or not, and that is indeed subjective (so far). But at least we know that <i>sometimes</i> a combination of too many features <i>can</i> be really bad, especially when working in large teams.<p>BTW, today C++ is quite effective because it&#x27;s become a (relative) niche language (even according to its creator). Niche languages are used by specialized teams that are good at enforcing discipline, and/or tend to be smaller.",1443467020
10292320,comment,10291666,10292204,0,0,alexqgb,,,"This is putting it politely. Using the word &quot;sharing&quot; in this context is more than a misuse, it is a deliberate misrepresentation. As such, it represents an clear ethical failure. The fact that it&#x27;s so public signals that you are dealing with a company that, on a very fundamental level, lacks an essential measure of courage, foresight, and integrity. It is—in simple terms—total bullshit.<p>I say all this having just returned from a wonderful weekend that was made much better by Airbnb. It was a great service, I enjoyed it immensely, and it&#x27;s sad to see that something so good could be ruined by leadership that threatens their brand by describing what they do with such overt dishonesty.<p>The sharing economy is real, it is also cash free. That&#x27;s by definition. If you were making money you are not &quot;sharing&quot; anything. You are conducting short term rentals, and that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> different beast. If you insist on using language like &quot;sharing&quot; anyway, don&#x27;t be surprised when people respond with a few choice words of their own. If those words sting, consider that proof that your own use—or misuse—of words really does matter.<p>Related: when facing a political backlash, don&#x27;t make your own position worse by giving your enemies even more ammunition.",1443467014

The result is usually each job getting a probabilistic 50% share of the cluster while they&#x27;re both running, and then whichever one runs longer saturating the cluster once the other ends.<p>This scheduling system, meanwhile, would seem to just hand the 10,000 nodes over to job A, and then sleep job B until job A is done.<p>Admittedly, in the case where the jobs <i>aren&#x27;t</i> submitted at the same time, and job A has already grabbed and saturated the cluster, the two cases collapse together: job B must wait (unless you want to schedule processes rather than containers; then you just degrade the cluster&#x27;s performance.)

Sometimes identifying mental characteristics/behaviors can be very important (for instance, depression) in that it allows you to start examining it and trying to correct it, or build a career or social life that takes account of it. But many people latch onto non-disorder labels (like introversion) and use it to justify all their behavior (&quot;I don&#x27;t want to go out on Friday night <i>because I&#x27;m an introvert</i>.&quot; - spoken by many of my friends, even when going out just meant a night in playing board games that they originally suggested).<p>This isn&#x27;t true of all introverts, but many self-identified introverts that I&#x27;ve met the last several years exhibit behavior more in common with burnout and depression.

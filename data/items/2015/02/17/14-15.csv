Which is why there are regulations and home inspections and all of that, to ensure that the appropriate safeties and switches are in place. Simply banning one of many possible mechanisms of generating power would be very short sighted.<p>Many regions that offer feed-in time-of-day tariffs are rightly trying to figure out how to accommodate battery systems, where some users are trying to game the system by charging a big battery array during low cost hours, and then &quot;selling&quot; it back to the grid during peak hours (at inflated, subsidized prices).<p>EDIT: As a reply to msandford, given that I can&#x27;t reply lower -- the reason they have this limit is that the tariff price paid to home solar/wind generators is <i>way</i> above the bulk, &quot;wholesale&quot; price of power. It was created as an incentive to encourage green energy. So when you feed back their own power to them, it does them no favor given that now they&#x27;re paying 2x+ what they would pay on the normal power market for power, and simply undermines the entire incentive program.",1424183661
9062361,comment,9062149,9062149,0,0,kls,,,"There are several factors but the biggest one was India, I never understood why software quality from India was so poor. Honestly, it made no logical sense, here is a population that has a group of individuals that are for whatever reasons fairly strong in STEM. It seemed inconsistent, until one day I met a developer named Karthick, Karthick could code and was a passionate developer, he was everything that India software quality was not. So I asked Karthick about my observations and why software coming back from India was so poor. What I found out amazed me What I thought was a complex problem, was actually a problem of incentives. See Karthick told me that in India, a man is measured by how many people he manages. It is a throw back to the cast systems and it is a source of pride. The fastest way to management, in India, is STEM and specifically computer programming. So what you get is a bunch of would be MBA&#x27;s, getting engineering degrees, that they do not want, to take a job that they do not want, to get a job they are not educated for and are not qualified for. So it creates a fail up environment.<p>This was the first wave of problems and honestly after the failures of BoA and several other US companies who lost billions trying to save a buck in that market, US companies are hesitant to enter that market again whole hog. They will pick up a developer or two to augment a team, but not many people are sending whole projects over anymore. Everyone has a horror story and it&#x27;s enough to make most would be bargain shoppers think twice about trying to save a dollar, by trading it for risk.<p>The second issue is one of tribal knowledge as I call it. People conduct their lives in very different ways from Central Asia to the US. What we take for granted as common knowledge over here may be a uncommon or not even done in your culture and vice versa. When we document systems, we take for granted &quot;common&quot; knowledge and it does not get documented. For example I worked on a system one time for a large hotel reservation engine that had work done in India. 2/3 of the development staff had never personally booked a hotel room online. It ended up costing more to have BA&#x27;s and Architects document the system, than it would have to have thrown the BA&#x27;s and Architects in a room with a bunch of developers. In the end what did we do, well we sent our CTO, our BA&#x27;s and our Architects to India to sit in a room for 2 months at a time until the project was a success. Basically enough from the VP&#x27;s to declare victory and get the hell out.<p>So what does it all boil down to, cultural mismatch. As US business homogeny (I don&#x27;t mean that in an arrogant sense, I mean it in a corporate culture way) and the Internets global village takes it&#x27;s hold on the globe, that mismatch becomes less of an issue, but someones is going to have to take the risk to prove it out, and unfortunately the generation that smashed on the rocks in India is now in the decision making seats and not many of them have an appetite to try a do over. Especially startups where project failures or delays can kill a promising idea.",1424183646

Their parts end up in the color-sorted bins along with all the rest, and the kids build crazy stuff out of whatever.

Further, trickle charging the backup batteries during the evenings/nighttime and allowing them to meet some needs during the day also means a higher net usage of generated power, so perhaps levels of generation could go down altogether.<p>There&#x27;s also then the capitalistic angle -- if you want more peak power at your house, you can buy more batteries in lieu of (or in concert with) installing secondary power systems.<p>But reducing gross energy production due to higher net utilization would be a really cool thing, so long as the total cost to the macro system (considering full life of the battery vs. load taken off power plants) is a net positive.",1424182300

The next logical step is homes that are unplugged and self power generating.    There is an incredible gap in society in the U.S. created by the tax code whereby if you make $25,000 and are a family of 5, you receive enough tax and food benefits and medical insurance to be equal to the person that makes $65,000 per year.  And if your income increases to $45,000, you will be losing money, so there is no motivation to reach that point.  The Living Off The Grid topic has gone viral because those stuck in the gap seek a way up without increasing income, because it&#x27;s hard to increase income without hurting oneself.  But the idea of downsizing and saving up has become popular with it.  Getting a little plat of land and a trailer or a tiny house for a time while saving up.... growing food, having chickens, all are ways to save up and gain without actual cash income increase.  Adding solar power to the mix helps prevent power bills.  It is also a terrific way to fire the local monopoly power company, who may or may not in your area have any decency of customer service.  Without competition, why would they have to care.  But the off grid movement is pulling the carpet out from under these government allowed monopolies and forcing competition.  In the same stroke, it removes the tax burden from the homeowner that was included in the electric bill.  If you have a solar or wind power system and charge your Tesla car too, then you have a completely tax free energy system.  It sounds like it&#x27;s taking away from the government, but the neat thing is, this can also be used to alleviate financial strain on the government.  If you can provide a self powered mobile home with rain-water collection to section 8 housing, then the government is also saving on those utility expenses.  And land is cheaper a little further out.     I recently bought 10 acres in Creek county Oklahoma.  The power company wanted $10,000 to add one pole into the land and connection.  I opted that it was better to spend that money on a solar power system.  The same was true of water with huge expense, so I opted for rainwater and later to add a well.  The up front costs associated with being on the grid for many rural areas, or adding more power poles is really more than costs will continue to be as they come down down down for self power generation.  This is all exciting to me.     We have to consider total  impact.  Hydro power is still a hugely terrific producer of energy.  Rain that fills the lake.... the lake is a battery.... stored to produce energy.  So rain makes our energy.  This is still a much better solution than building batteries for large power needs.  Yet the infrastructure and labor required to put in poles and wires is too high for homes in light of these modern developements.  I look forward to an exciting and bright future.  ~David Webster   Offgridquest.com and Facebook&#x27;s Living off the Grid",1424182263

For example, Connecticut has laws which don&#x27;t allow houses to have batteries that would allow a house to be self sustaining and have a connection to the grid. This is because if you have batteries which cause a back flow during a power outage to the power station, an electrical worker could get shocked down the road.<p>The fact that lithium batteries aren&#x27;t the greenest combined with the fact that you can&#x27;t even live &#x27;off the grid&#x27; in a grid tied system is a big uphill for these batteries.",1424181678

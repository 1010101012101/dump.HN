I was writing code in a notebook on my 1.5 hour train commute and on my lunch break and then typing it up on weekends.\nAfter I went full-time on my own business I found that the scope of what I wanted to do expanded and my productivity dropped. Also, the time-management skills that worked well on a part-time basis didn't work as well when I went full-time. I also found that it was easy to get sidetracked by side-projects and that personal life (time with friends, holidays) became a larger part of my life. I also found that a lot of things that I wasn't so great at (web design, graphics) etc. took up a large amount of my time.<p>So I would be interested to hear your thoughts on time-management, prioritization and working from home once you go full-time if you decide to do this as a series.",1269178516

1207916,comment,1207721,1207721,0,0,jpatte,,,"IMHO, writing software is actually an excellent example of an engineering task. The reason we see all these failures in software development is, in fact, that most software developers are NOT engineers. This is where all this pain comes from.<p>The role of engineering is to apply a theoretical model/representation of a physical fact, in order to achieve a desired result. The role of science is to provide these models with maximum accuracy.<p>The better a model is (equations, empirical laws...), and the better the engineer masters this model, the more accurate will be the expected results.<p>Programming languages, frameworks and patterns <i>are</i> scientific models, designed to represent the working of a computer. Bugs and unexpected behaviors in a program are due to a bad application of these models. If you know <i>exactly</i> what you are doing (i.e. you have a deep understanding/knowledge of these models), there is no reason for you to observe some unexpected failures. The more experience you have, the better you understand these models, and the more productive you are.<p>Of course this is just theory: in practice, things are getting quickly complicated and it is humanly impossible to predict everything that will happen - that's why testing exists. But my opinion is one would see much less failures in software development if developers were actually experienced engineers. Many developers today have no idea <i>what</i> they are doing, essentially because they are juniors and inexperienced. Unlike engineers, they are not trained to mentally play with the theoretical tools they use, so they cannot predict the results. And yes, at this point software development becomes more an art than an engineering task. It's like juggling without being able to predict the trajectory of the balls.",1269176858

I mean native WebApp browser :)<p>I was fan of HTML5 ( because of it&#x27;s open nature and cross-platform thing ) and thought that it is going the right direction, until I finished watching &#x27;Crockford on javascript&#x27; series and I said to myself what... ?!<p>I think browser are going the wrong way because:<p>1. the web is not static web pages anymore\n2. the client devices are more powerful that can handle many computation \n3. today the web is all about data \n4. the whole idea of browsers apart from navigation is security and sandboxing (I think)\n5. and at last I think the browsers are an extra layer on top of OS we have to use existing OS features<p>so why not going this way:<p>1. seprate Interface from data \n2. no DOM stuff , use existing native UI\n3. use web services like RESTful ... ( the whole Semantic web and Linked data concepts )\n4. use web as a CPU and Hard Disk nothing more ( the whole SOA and WOA concepts )\n5. create new language independent platform or at lease choose a robust language ( I vote for python, and I know that javascript has a good part but I don&#x27;t want to teach my future kids javascript :D ) \n6. transfer plain text not compiled code ( like Google NaCl ) \n7. use google play and Appstore concept ( the new kind of search engine )<p>so what do you thing? am I missing something ?",1372240304

So first of all I think the innovation couchbase and others are bringing is wonderful, and I think stuff spun off of such efforts may eventually eat Oracles lunch.<p>That said Oracle has never been about the DB entirely. Nobody buys Oracle for the DB.  They buy it for the ecosystem and familiarity that surround the DB. Mostly it&#x27;s about internal applications for businesses.<p>Big companies don&#x27;t want rapid innovation.  They want something that works for years and years and that the office workers that doesn&#x27;t know about keyboard shortcuts (I met one on monday) won&#x27;t have to relearn regularly.  They want tried and true.  They want a nice safe GUI interface.<p>So keep innovating for tommorow. NoSQL should evolve rapidly. But the way to beat Oracle is not evolving rapidly.  It&#x27;s making the best CRUD app possible currently, and selling long term support.  It&#x27;s training those office workers in something so that it&#x27;s familiar, and showing how it&#x27;s better then current projects.  It&#x27;s building a brand.<p>I believe software is eating the world, but some parts are going to be digested very very slowly. Hopefully not Bank software and COBOL slowly, but you never know.<p>Though personally, I love innovation.  I love teaching people new things. And I think most people can learn, if the support is going to be there. The office worker who didn&#x27;t know keyboard shortcuts?  I taught her how to search in the browser, and basic cut and paste shortcuts.",1372240154

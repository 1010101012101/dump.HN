1656795,comment,1656136,1656781,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, this is the biggest issue for me too (as an American who hasn't lived anywhere else). In particular, the tying to your employment status makes everything complicated and coverage uncertain for everyone except career employees who stay with one firm. For example, I switched from a full-time student to part-time for one semester in grad school. Oops, this means I don't get the student health insurance anymore and have to buy gap coverage. So I had to research gap insurance, fill out a bunch of paperwork, wait to be approved, and then still hope that I don't really have to use it, because now the recent change in insurance gives them excuses to claim things were preexisting and thus excluded.<p>And I don't even have any major chronic conditions! People with major chronic health issues are pretty much required to stay in their current job forever, because if they lose their health insurance they're screwed. The whole employment-tying thing puts a huge drain on entrepreneurship, imo, because lots of people who would start companies are scared of losing their health insurance, and even if you can figure it out, it's a huge bureaucratic hassle. One area where the private sector has managed to gallantly out-bureaucratize any government.<p>In short, I really, <i>really</i> wish that health-insurance was completely decoupled from employment. It would reduce a lot of friction in the economy, imo.",1283446651

1656771,comment,1656404,1656690,0,0,lotharbot,,,"One of the keys to both Montessori style instruction and ""un-schooling"" is the recognition that children learn at their own pace.  Sometimes their brains aren't ready for a particular topic, and trying to get them to learn it too early can do a lot of harm (much like ""learning"" a physical activity before the muscles and bones are ready for it), or at the very least won't do much good.  On the other hand, when a kid is ready to learn a topic, he may pick it up much more quickly than the lesson plans expect.  Teacher-initiated schooling, with its curriculum and standards boards, usually doesn't have the flexibility to accommodate different kids' different readiness to learn different topics.<p>Within the context of child-initiated learning, it's certainly worthwhile to have someone introduce a child to new topics, inspire them to learn, and provide answers to their questions.  Some amount of structure and some amount of teacher initiation is useful.<p>With my own children, I plan to be somewhere on the un-schooling-to-Montessori end of the spectrum.

Based on the research we've done, it's a straightforward way to get better educational results for your kids if done properly.<p>We're planning on some variation of the ""Robinson Curriculum"" (<a href=""http://www.robinsoncurriculum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robinsoncurriculum.com/</a>), which in essence is a simple daily structure of (1) a daily math lesson, from the Saxon math series or similar, (2) daily reading, based on their interest but with a few recommendations, and (3) daily writing about any topic that interests them, which is then proofread and corrected by the child.<p>""Socialization"" is pretty much a non-issue, as far as I'm concerned. The above structure takes a few hours a day, so there's more than enough time for play and structured activities like sports or music if they're interested. As tommynazareth commented, the socialization in schools is mostly negative.<p>The key seems to be striking a balance between a clear and simple structure and letting your child follow their interests. It also requires some self-control by the parents - it's better to let your kids struggle at times when they find hard problems than immediately jump in and help them. The parent isn't doing the teaching - they're helping the child learn to self-educate, which is a major difference.<p>I want my children to be able to think clearly, learn essential skills, and be able to teach themselves anything they're interested in learning.

1656751,comment,1656136,1656136,0,0,all,,,"I used to be self-employed in the US and left in part because of the expense of health insurance.  At the time, I had a family of three.  When you declare yourself self-employed in the US, you are immediately projected into the highest tax bracket of (if memory serves correctly) 37.5%.  Decent health insurance for three cost worked out to be around 40% of that at the time.  So, to be self-employed with healthcare cost me around 52% of my then gross salary.  And that is just for the plan - there is still a huge excess as well as a plethora of things that the insurance companies won't cover.  If memory serves correctly, something like 40% of those in the US are without healthcare.  At costs like that, little wonder why.<p>As for poverty in the US, 1 in 8 are in poverty if you use the CIA-polished statistics.  I say CIA-polished because the CIA also says the US spends 12.5% of its GDP on healthcare.  According to the OECD, it is more like 15.3%.  By comparison, France (top healthcare in the world according to the WHO) spends around 9.5% or so.  Canada, number 6 in the world, spends something similar, around 9.7%.  The UK, which is somewhere around 20th on the WHO rankings, spends 6.25%.  For its 12.5%/15.3%, the US ranks 33rd - just above Cuba.<p>As for saving up for children's college, university educations are an increasingly well-known bubble in the US.  It is not uncommon to have 70 or even many more students packed into a single auditorium for lectures.  Even in advanced degrees, there is not as much small group or singular education as there is in Europe.  But the costs are nevertheless huge.  If I recall correctly, American University in DC currently tops the charts with tuition at $50k per year.  That is tuition ONLY.  It does not include, books, dorm, clothes, etc.  A four-year degree thus has a base cost of $200k.  It is nothing anymore for universities to charge $25-30k per year just for tuition.  Given that this is the case at a time when many people are losing their houses because they can't make the payments and others can't get on the property ladder because they can't afford the down payment, I would say it is damn hard in the US to pay for things that people in Sweden take for granted.<p>Just my 2¢.

How much can one contribute to retirement accounts to avoid paying income tax that year?<p>2.) Where are the key discontinuous cutoff points in the tax system? (social security maxes out, certain payments to the needy disappear, etc)<p>3.) What is the typical marginal propensity to consume?<p>4.) How much wealth has one accumulated by a certain age in life, which can be invested, which is only taxed at lower capital gains / dividend rates?<p>My thoughts on the first are mixed.  Yes, we don't pay taxes this year on money we stash into a non-roth 401k, but I hope they aren't doing the bad accounting of treating that as 0% tax... we will eventually pay SOME tax when we withdraw on it, just not this year.<p>The second point is very valid... there is a magic range around $110-$160K income right now where your marginal tax rate from paying social security is almost 12% lower than the guys making $80K-$110K.  In the US, you and your employer each pay 6.2% of your earned income to social security, but it caps at $110K (the rationale being you won't get credit for more than that at retirement, so they won't take more).<p>The final points are a bit bogus in terms of providing us guidance, but they are more of the author's observations from the data they studied.  Poor people consume more as a percentage of their income and hence pay more sales tax each year.  Wealthier people buy more, but less as a percentage of their income, so they pay less sales tax, and save more over time which can be turned into investment income.<p><a href=""http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/Does%20It%20Pay%20to%20Work%20and%20Save,%20December%209,2006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.bu.edu/kotlikoff/Does%20It%20Pay%20to%20Work%2...</a>",1283445560

Some of it sounds like a pre-flight briefing manual sans the helpful illustrations and other parts sound like a PR fluff piece. For example;<p>>>>But here's the catch. When a helicopter flies forward, the rotor blades experience a dramatic variation in airspeed. That's easy to see if you imagine a miniature version of yourself perched on the tip of a helicopter rotor blade. If the helicopter were hovering, you'd feel a constant 800-km/h wind in your face as the rotor spun around. If the helicopter were to fly forward, you would note that the wind was stronger on what's called the advancing side, when the rotor was moving in the same direction as the helicopter, but that it would be noticeably weaker when the rotor was on the retreating side. By the time the helicopter reached 150 km/h, you would feel a wind speed of 950 km/h on the advancing side, versus 650 km/h on the retreating side....<<<<p>I had to re-read this paragraph at least 2-3 times to understand what it exactly meant. It was just too vague. What direction should I face? Am I moving clockwise or counterclockwise? What does it mean that the rotor is moving in the same direction as the helicopter?<p>Then there was this paragraph, which sounds... fake considering the tone of the rest of the article.<p>>>>With everyone's nerves on edge, the X2 started up its engine at 6:30 a.m., and the helicopter took off. Within a few minutes the X2 had reached a speed of 350 km/h. A dozen people watched from the ground as the airspeed crept up, first to 400, then 410, and finally topping out at 435 km/h—not quite the goal we'd set, but good enough for this round. Cheers and applause broke out on the ground. The pilot slowed the X2, turned it around, and flew back to land on the runway.<<<<p>The same person who had trouble explaining the simple imagery of a rotating blade can't write something as flowery as that.

While facebook publishes their own app now, again, they weren't exactly the first to hit the platform in the first place.<p>What exactly are you expecting skype to do differently on the iPad than the iPhone? What are you expecting the non-iPhone shaped UI to give you that the iPhone shaped UI doesn't? The iPad isn't exactly a perfect platform for videoconferencing (no camera), and the phone version works fine.<p>All that said, lets talk about technical/policy/business issues which cause people to not specialize on the iPad.<p>First off: Business reasons.<p>Business wise, the iPad has <i>very few users</i> compared to the iPhone/iPod Touch formfactor. So when you write to that audience, you're paying for a generally more expensive app, to reach fewer people. Is this a bad thing? For companies that could grow too fast, it might be a positive thing, but on the whole a smaller audience is bad. On the plus side however, those who own iPads tend to be more affluent and are willing to buy more expensive applications, so you can get higher unit prices to somewhat compensate for that, if your concept is appealing to people.<p>Next up: Policy Issues<p>Apple is not the easiest of companies to ""write software for"". And while you're not writing it ""for"" them per se, you have to jump through a series of hoops they tell you to. And with the iPad, you have a list of guidelines to follow which are quite a bit different than with the iPhone/iPodTouch sized apps. Your apps need to handle all orientations for the most part, your apps need to observe the more complex menu-ing paradigms, your apps need to usually have more sophisticated art assets, and you also have a higher expectation of not looking ""cruddy"" for lack of a better word.<p>While the enforcement of these ""guidelines"" are all over the map, people routinely DO get rejected for violating some or all of them. This means the cost of iPad development goes up.<p>Technical considerations:<p>Hybrid apps, those which work both on the phone and pad in the ""native"" resolution of the platforms require you to either A> violate the assumptions of one or both platforms or B> create completely different screen layouts for each ""mode"" of the application.  Those ""modes"" would be iPhone, iPad landscape, iPad Portrait. Menuing is different in the two orientations on the iPad, and expectations of pretty animations are much higher in general.<p>Until November or so, you'll see that additionally that iPad is on 3.2.1 of iOS and iPhones are on 4.0.1. This means the iPad is missing many of the cutting edge features that 4.x has. So if you're writing a hybrid app, you have to work around sometimes having certain features, and sometimes not, and additionally you have all the issue with different aspect ratios, etc.<p>Hopefully I've explained some of the issues. I've tried to be brief, this is a complicated subject, but basically, this is it, and it's <i>also</i> a huge barrier to entry, which means many good business opportunities still exist on the iPad.",1283445185

When you step away for anything more than a quick phone call, or a business meeting in the conference room, then you're not coworking efficiently.<p>Sure, coworking can be a distraction, but having access to brilliant and skilled people around you to bounce ideas off, look at your code, or make your day better is priceless and far outweighs time lost due to distraction.<p>The reason that many of us gravitate toward coworking to begin with is that we're lonely.

Sending my children to a detention center five days a week is incompatible with the sort of family life I'd like to have.<p>The biggest argument for sending kids to school is that it gives them an opportunity to socialize. I'd agree with this in a limited sense. Yes, they get to be surrounded by other children, but socialization outside of sanctioned time periods is punished (I spent a lot of my time in school sitting in 'timeout' in the hallway), and the socialization that occurs in such an unnatural setting is probably not optimal - in fact, it's common in America to refer to immature social settings as being 'high school'. I have friends who were home schooled, and they had no trouble meeting friends during their school age years.<p>I'd let my kids go to school to see what it is like, provided they know enough not to buy in to it, and they are going just to have fun and make friends.<p>* I'm a little reluctant to make this claim, since I am not yet a parent, but it all boils down to this: there is no way in hell that anyone cares more about my children's education and personal development than I do, so I am the best candidate for assuming that responsibility.",1283444109

Of course, not all of this is in taxes.<p>To check this: find a ""gas buddy"" site for a place in Canada, then find one for the nearest US city/town close to it (to control for price disparity due to shipping).<p>Multiply cost per liter by 3.6 to get equivalent US Gallon; then adjust it by current exchange rate.<p>Example:  lowest for Vancouver, BC:  <a href=""http://www.vancouvergasprices.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vancouvergasprices.com/</a>  is currently 106.9 per liter ($1.069 CAD) , times 3.6 = $3.85 CAD , about $3.66 per US Gallon in USD.<p>Closest city on the US side is Bellingham, WA, lowest price there is $2.82, or about US $ 0.80 difference per gallon.<p>Assuming a fill-up is 12 gallons, that is ~$10 per tank difference.",1283443508

You know what I'm thinking to myself? ""If this guy can't figure this part out, then I'm certainly not about to tell him that I could be that technical co-founder.""<p>Sorry - that's the truth though. IMO, if you are business & marketing person, then either you should already have a set of contacts that you could ask for help on or, plan b, you would have a handle on groups locally in your area that would lead you to such a person (or to someone who could lead you to someone). If plan A isn't working out for whatever reason, then figure out plan B. I can promise you that posting here is less productive than pressing the flesh with local folks in your own town.",1283443454

Since there's no algorithm backing it the only thing you can do is list out all the things you can think of or have run into that is ""wrong"".<p>Using a parser (well lexer really) like Ragel I can make something that's relaxed, but it's more of a white-list of what it <i>accepts</i>.  The algorithm explictily says this particular set of characters in this grammar is all that I'll answer to.<p>If you then write the grammar so that it handles 99% of the requests you run into in the wild, you get the same relaxed quality as a hand written one, but it explicitly drops the 1% that are invalid or usually hacks.<p>This is also the same parser that's power a large number of web servers in multiple languages, so it's proven to work.",1283443409

We're so used to man-made constructions that when we see something that we did <i>not</i> build, we tend to attribute its existence to an entity which is conveniently like us.<p>What did you mean by ""creator""? From what I can see: us, or God. So, what we did not create (like the complexity of life), must have been created by God.<p>But what did you mean by ""God""? Most of the time, God is refereed to as an infinitely smart, infinitely potent, utterly incomprehensible entity (""the ways of God are impenetrable""), which is very much like us (""he made us in his image""). In other words, magic with a personality.<p>I have a problem with magic: it explains everything, by explaining nothing. It's what in <a href=""http://lesswrong.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com</a> they call a ""curiosity stopper"".  In the face of magic (or God), I feel like a balrog before Gandalf: I <i>cannot pass</i>. It's very frustrating, because I'm naturally curious.<p>And to a point, I can satisfy my curiosity.  For instance, the creator the complexity of life is evolution (skipping very very long explanation that I don't fully understand).  The creator of evolution is the laws of physics, whose creator is… I don't know.  For now the buck stops there.  It doesn't mean, however that it should <i>stick</i> there.  That would be freezing the current boundaries of our knowledge.  If I replace ""I don't know"" by ""God"", I forbid myself to look further.  Maybe there <i>isn't</i> anything further, but that I don't know.<p>So, you don't ""know"" there's a creator.  You just marvel at the mystery of the creation. You don't want to <i>really</i> explain the creation, for it's precious mystery would be gone.  Or you are just uncomfortable with uncertainty, so you tell yourself a story where the scariest uncertainties are easily explained.<p>Or you just didn't think this through. Yet.",1283443391

Even on a relatively optimized build of Chromium 7.0.510.0, it's pretty typical for me to see memory usage of ~300MB with only three tabs open. I shudder to think how much memory Chromium eats when used by tab junkies who have 20+ pages open at a time.<p>I can see how Chromium gives users the illusion that it's slim, but I don't think it's accurate to call it that.

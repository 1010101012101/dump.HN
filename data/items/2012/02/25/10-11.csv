3632672,comment,3632486,3632486,3,0,drostie,,,"I actually still think that one of the best ways is to watch some of the Abelson-Sussman lectures. Unfortunately, they teach Scheme, but fortunately... they teach Scheme. (They also unfortunately have prehistoric audio quality.)<p><pre><code>     http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/\n</code></pre>\nThe bad thing about Scheme is that while it prepares you for function-oriented languages like Clojure and JavaScript (and hence Node.js) and to some extent Python, Scheme is not used by itself much on the web.<p>The great thing about Scheme is that, unlike Python -- where I suddenly find myself explaining that this is generator syntax, that is function syntax, and so on -- lisps (like Scheme) have some extremely simple syntax principles. This makes them very easy to teach to someone who hasn't seen programming before, and helps people through understanding what exactly machines do.<p>You may also want to start with JavaScript. (Do not confuse JS with Java.) JS has some of the best returns for its investment, because if you're building web apps, you will eventually have to face it anyway. (JS is the programming language of the Web.) You should run Firefox with Firebug (and eventually GreaseMonkey) if you want to make the most day-to-day use of learning JS.<p>JS allows you to more readily have a concrete goal. Concrete goals are great for the dive-right-in school of programming. Let me offer this as something attainable: Sudoku. Go and find a web site which lets you play sudoku, and if you've never played, familiarize yourself with the rules. There are a bunch of them, like ""if all the other numbers appear in this row, column, and box except one, then this number should be that one number."" I will give you a little bit of a head start on this: on the site puzzle-sudoku.net, here is how to get the board elements in a JavaScript object which you can then enumerate and query:<p><pre><code>    // useful to know the JS operators:\n    //   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence\n    // and the floor() function:\n    //   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor\n    function sudoku_groups(inputs) {\n        var out, i, row, col, box, square;\n        out = {rows: [], cols: [], boxes: [], all: []};\n        for (i = 0; i < 9; i += 1) {\n            out.rows[i] = [];\n            out.cols[i] = [];\n            out.boxes[i] = [];\n        }\n        for (i = 0; i < inputs.length; i += 1) {\n            row = Math.floor(i / 9);\n            col = i % 9; \n            box = 3 * Math.floor(row / 3) + Math.floor(col / 3);\n            square = {row: row, col: col, box: box, input: inputs[i]};\n            out.rows[row].push(square);\n            out.cols[col].push(square);\n            out.boxes[box].push(square);\n            out.all.push(square);\n        }\n        return out;\n    }\n    var board = sudoku_groups(\n        // this selection line would be different for other web sites:\n        document.getElementsByClassName(""brd"")[0].getElementsByTagName(""input"")\n    );\n\n    board.boxes[3]; // write this to inspect the 4th box in Firebug.\n</code></pre>\nI'm not saying you have to know what all of that does right now! Especially if you've never seen JavaScript before. But I am making your first programming task a little easier by solving the problem of finding the elements and turning them into a useful data structure for you to play with. Once you know the language a bit better, you might like to peek inside this to see how it works -- but you might also just use Firebug's ""inspector"" tools to see what the data structures look like without my help.<p>When you want to start <i>solving</i> the Sudoku, you might start looking through board.all to see which elements do not yet have a value. Then you might want to start writing and using rules like this:<p><pre><code>    function fill_in_if_only_one_option_remains(square) {\n        var options;\n        options = [\n            false, // 0 is not an option\n            true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true\n        ];\n        // here is how you cross off a square from the options\n        function cross_off(other_square) {\n            options[other_square.input.value] = false;\n        }\n        if (square.input.value === ""\") {\n            // to be perhaps written by you: cross off all of the options which\n            // appear in board.boxes[square.box], board.rows[square.row], and\n            // board.cols[square.col]. Then, if there is exactly one option \n            // left, fill it in, like ""square.input.value = 9;""\n        }\n    }\n    // then you can apply it to the whole Sudoku board like this:\n    board.all.forEach(fill_in_if_only_one_option_remains);\n    // it might be useful to look up Array.forEach() :\n    //   https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you might realize that this rule is not quite strong enough to solve Sudoku puzzles, and start thinking about how to describe even stronger Sudoku-solving strategies to a your computer. You might start a GreaseMonkey script to try to apply the automatic procedures every 1000 ms (every second) that you're on this page, so that as you solve the Sudoku the computer ""helps you out"" in realtime. You might start implementing 'speculative' algorithms, where you type 'a' instead of 1, 'b' instead of 2, and so on, to see if this leads to a contradiction somewhere down the line -- and your computer can notice that you're thinking speculatively and start to type 'a', 'b', and 'c' alongside you. (You might want to use an uppercase letter to denote the letter which started the speculative train of thought off, though, because it will quickly get lost!)<p>So that's the sort of thing which programming is, and that's how I'd look to learn it. Dive right in like a six-year-old: play for ten minutes, fall, hurt yourself, cry for five; then get up and breathe deep and play with it some more, repeat as necessary.",1330166254

3632667,story,,,1,0,hummingbird1,Brainstorming,http://blog.reseapro.com/?p=56,"Brainstorming is a process for developing creative solutions to problems. Brainstorming works by focusing on a problem, and then deliberately coming up with as many solutions as possible and by pushing the ideas as far as possible. One of the reasons it is so effective is that the brainstormers not only come up with new ideas in a session, but also spark off from associations with other peoples ideas by developing and refining them. While some research has found brainstorming to be ineffective, this seems more of a problem with the research itself than with the brainstorming tool (Isaksen, 1998). There are four basic rules in brainstorming (Osborn, 1963) intended to reduce social inhibitions among team members, stimulate idea generation, and increase overall creativity:<p>No criticism: Criticism of ideas are withheld during the brainstorming session as the purpose is on generating varied and unusual ideals and extending or adding to these ideas. Criticism is reserved for the evaluation stage of the process. This allows the members to feel comfortable with the idea of generating unusual ideas.\nWelcome unusual ideas: Unusual ideas are welcomed as it is normally easier to tame down than to tame up as new ways of thinking and looking at the world may provide better solutions.\nQuantity Wanted: The greater the number of ideas generated, the greater is the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.\nCombine and improve ideas: Not only are a variety of ideals wanted, but also ways to combine ideas in order to make them better.",1330166061

I then to proceed to:<p>A) Attempt to convince them that I am a machine.<p>B) Convince them that they're a machine.<p>(Obligatory XKCD: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/329/</a>)<p>So far the tally is something like: I've convinced two people of my non-humanity. And B hasn't happened yet. Which brings me back to this story. The moment I finished it, after the thought about getting the memories of someone more compatible with the idea of a brain simulation, my face formed a mischievous smile.<p>I thought ""This will be great for the next time I get on Omegle.""",1330164908

Resolved these issues anyhow.<p>On review, its fair enough if you love ASP.NET MVC, but I really don't like the mixing of the View Logic with the Model in ASP.NET MVC, like I already said keep it clean. From a View point of view keep it decoupled I say, keep any server side code out of there. At the end of the day , I have to agree ASP.NET MVC has got rich resources and it is a great offering for developers, no doubt.<p>And MVC 4 useS knockout js behind the scenes anyhow, which is really great and personally I think that knockout goes far enough.<p>The only reason I say this, is because I just refactored about 20 Web Form Views to pure HTML/CSS/js  on the client side and turned out I had no need for any server side at all except for the restful service (hidden away in my knockout view model, used amplify.js to abstract the service calls) created on top of my domain model.\nso I am thinking, why do I need MVC if I have Restful WCF/  ASP.NET Web API.\nGoing this way means I am totally decoupled!<p>I am much happier building a restful service, knowing that any client can consume this, and I think I am happy building client side anyway that I so choose and not tying myself into ASP.NET MVC unnecessarily.<p>So here's the deal for me if go pure W3C on the client :<p>1. No mixing in logic<p>2. Don't care about the server or server side code.<p>3. I can mock my backend real easy ( e.g. Amplify.js )<p>4. I don't need Visual Studio for client side dev.<p>5. There's a growing wealth of open source libraries<p>6. Makes me think more about the structure of my server side behavioural domain model.<p>Anyways, just how I see things..always open to more compelling arguments!",1330164649

3632635,comment,3632261,3632625,4,0,ghshephard,,,"I like Michael Arrington's perspective on this (I can't believe I just typed that) - which is there really is no such thing as objectivity, and the best a reader can hope for is as much transparency as possible.  I agree, that a lot of these ""journalists"" rely on their sources for access, and don't want to burn their bridges, so they may give a somewhat biased report (in return for future access).  There are also other biases, like David Pogues writing the ""Missing Manual"" series, while at the same time providing a supposedly unbiased review of the devices he is writing manuals for.   I love Pogues Reviews - I just wish he was a little more aggressively transparent when he writes a review for something that he might be gaining financially from.<p>But, at the very least, most people know where Pogue, Gruber, Siegler are coming from - so we go to them when we want the ""Pro-Apple"" perspective.  The sad thing is how rarely fans of the Apple Aesthetic are willing to go read the ""Anti-Apple"" perspective (Is there such a source?  )  And what about the Objective review?  Mossberg has been panning Apple quite a bit recently - maybe he's the objective reviewer...",1330164524

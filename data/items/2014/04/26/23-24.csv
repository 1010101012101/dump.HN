7653245,comment,7647958,7648616,1,0,mapt,,,"For Falcon 9 though, the first stage contributes so much of the dV that it is not particularly feasible to land it at the launch site - by the time it separates, it&#x27;s moving at several kilometers per second away from the launch site towards the horizon.  That opens up the question of where the launch/landing site pair is bound to be.  A ship-based landing system, such as a semisubmersible oil drilling rig (only ~$1B used!) with a landing pad built onto it, would seem to be close to optimal for the F9 specifically.<p>The Falcon Heavy&#x27;s 2 side boosters, on the other hand, will separate much earlier in the flight - they are likely to be much more practical to land at the launch site, particularly for direct geosynchronous payloads that allow a lot more vertical / near-vertical burn time in relation to horizontal.",1398556759

7653242,comment,7652651,7653012,4,0,amirmc,,,"I like the article but I don&#x27;t think it makes its point clearly.<p>What I took from it is that notions and mechanisms of defining leadership/influence are somewhat orthogonal to problem-solving.<p>In the example, it was Martha who came up with the solution, yet when asked who had been most &#x27;influential&#x27; [1] it was Arne. Does that mean Arne was the &#x27;leader&#x27;? According to the psychologists viewpoint/definition, yes, but does it really matter? When the question is re-framed and they watch the video again the author proposes that there was only <i>one</i> &#x27;effective influencing action&#x27;, which came from Martha. I find this viewpoint just as valid (and useful) as the former (i.e. not very).<p>[1] Note also that influence and influencing actions aren&#x27;t defined in this post. It&#x27;s difficult to discuss this with out further detail. It even seems like the definition changes partway through.",1398556755

Personally I manage two racks full of servers and if I had a magic wand it would be awesome just to have one or two big servers. (64 gigs of ram, lots of 2.5 drives, 4 or 6 processors)<p>Right now co-location providers are desperate because Amazon and others are taking away a lot of their business so you can get a good price.<p>I have a friend (manages his own servers) who has a hosting business and he brings in enough to be happy, about $10k a month.  He hosts ASP and .NET sites with no marketing budget he just posts to various forums and website hosting comparison sites.<p>I really like Supermicro servers and Dell Servers.... Supermicro makes some really big servers that you can add your own components to and I find them very reliable.  For a friend some years ago I put together a $24k server and they paid for it with a business lease through Bank of America.<p>I used to own the domain ehosting.com and tried doing hosting but it just isn&#x27;t my thing.  Getting everything to work for a people was far more work then I expected.  If I were to try again I would just offer virtualized servers and not have any hand in customers setups.<p>Having a specialty in hosting I believe is important.  For example for $14.95 a month from GoDaddy I have an account with unlimited space and unlimited domains.  I have hosted about 30 domains and 24 gigs of files all for $14.95.  I also have a virtualized server from GoDaddy for $39.95 a month which I use a coupon code and save about 20% off a month.",1398556065

No clearance needed, no degree, no special skills beyond being trainable on a computer, etc. Weeks.<p>I can only imagine the difficulty present in needing to run through the hiring process <i>and</i> having to run a security clearance. Especially in the wake of Snowden, Aaron Alexis, Manning, and USIS screening contractor scandals, which have all combined to help guarantee that no one tries to so much as streamline any part of the SF-86 and its background investigation.<p>The military even has problems with this; it&#x27;s not uncommon for new accessions to be delayed at their initial entry training schoolhouses due to &quot;clearance issues&quot;. But they&#x27;re at least already drawing a paycheck, and it&#x27;s not as if the students waiting can just take a new job out of their frustration. And as the article mentions, it&#x27;s in many ways much easier (as far as red tape goes) to join the military than to join the civil service.<p>I hope DHS get better hiring authorities. It may seem weird in SV but &quot;direct hire&quot; is practically fighting words for many groups watching the government, who are concerned that it would just be abused for nepotism.<p>However I do agree with the points about not needing people with a clearance.

After watching the tape, Arnie, Phyllis, and Weber changed their answer to &#x27;Martha.&#x27; Why? Because in terms of solving their problem, the table of effective inﬂuencing actions should have read<p>Arnie 0 actions<p>Phyllis 0 actions<p>Weber 0 actions<p>Martha 1 action<p>Without Martha&#x27;s contribution, the meeting would have gone nowhere, yet non-programming psychologists would have probably missed Martha&#x27;s role entirely.

Localize.js automates most of the localization process, which lets you localize your site in ~10% of the time it would normally take.<p>The traditional way you&#x27;d localize a website is by replacing text in your template files with string keys. For example:<p><h1>Hello world!</h1> .<p>becomes...<p><h1>{{ t &#x27;homepage.hello_world&#x27; }}</h1><p>You&#x27;d then maintain dictionary files that maps &quot;homepage.hello_world&quot; to &quot;Hello world!&quot;, with a separate dictionary for each language. Additional complications arise when you want to pluralize phrases, since different languages pluralize phrases differently, etc. It&#x27;s a pain to setup an effective localization workflow using the traditional approach.<p>Localize.js handles all of this automatically, and removes the need to convert your template files or manage your own phrases and translations.

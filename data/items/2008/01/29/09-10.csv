106059,comment,105909,105997,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Good point. I was a fan of it (as a young-un). Enabled me to catalogue all sorts of stuff in a nice database (with multimedia before the term was common).<p>I think 2 reasons:<p>1) There are generally fewer open source projects with truly user friendly interfaces (cause its a lot of grinding work). \n2) Hypercard made pseudo-programming easier for non programmers. Something that the type of people who tend to work on open source don't always agree with. Heck, if you don't workin in language XYZ, you are vile scum worthy of death, for XYZ <= blub.",1201600491

106056,comment,105946,105946,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Good idea.  The website is slow, even at 1:20 am Pacific.  They allow you to import your LinkedIn profile and invite any of your linkedin contacts.  They also offer 10% referral bonuses; you get % of your contacts' interview revenue.  I can see why the registrations are growing exponentially even if it's invite only.<p>They evaluate you post-interview on the following:<p>---% - you took the interview seriously<p>---% - you were on time for the interview<p>---% - your profile was accurate<p>---% - they'd recommend you to others",1201599114

Certainly their focus is on startups founded by gifted programmers.<p>The one in Philadelphia, at least, will consider startups in the life sciences or pure sciences.

Also look beyond the desktop search and see the visualization element.<p>They could do (and will do) so much with that. Webmynd is a very young start up who are executing like tigers.<p>Obviously most people will condemn the idea as indifferent from what they are used to. Well this is the key differentiator between those who innovate & see possibilities and those who watch and fail.<p>Minor rant over. Give em a chance!",1201598685

106052,comment,106020,106020,0,0,gduffy,,,"Are they accessing pages, or just opening connections? Use netstat to see what state the connections are in.<p>Make sure syncookies are enabled if they are just opening lots of connections (<a href=""http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html</a>).<p>You can limit parallel connections per host with iptables. See 'connlimit'. Drop any invalid SYN packets. There's also 'recent' which you can use to keep a dynamic list of ip addresses sending n SYNs over the past m seconds (then drop new connections). Bonus is that's the list of IPs is accessible/modifiable from /proc. Be careful not to kick out legitimate clients by setting too low a limit, though. Iptables can log, too, so maybe you can sample connections for a few seconds, 'sort | uniq -c' the ips, and decide on a cutoff.<p>There are also network appliances that will do similar things without loading your web server.<p>SHOW PROCESSLIST on your mysql, figure out what queries are happening. It could just be that you need a new index, more appropriate configuration, or better queries. In any case, at least it will give you a clue as to what is causing the load.<p>Use mod_status (or similar for your web server) to figure out what your Apache workers are doing. Modify keep-alive times.<p>If all else fails, see if your ISP can enable TCP Intercept on your nearest router.

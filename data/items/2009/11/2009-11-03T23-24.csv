It also shows that even this model - which is simpler than what you propose - has difficulty gaining acceptance.<p>I also don't see in what context you want to use this protocol, but there are a lot of fora that would be improved if only one had the ability to write Usenet-style killfiles (which can do a lot more than kill by author!). However, NNTP and SMTP clients largely already have these abilities to a sufficient level that you'll have a hard time displacing them, and web fora are very different and hard to script client-side.",1257292510

JackTheDonkey.com is the community where your time online supports the charity of your choice. Or what some call, a socially responsible social network.<p>Jack donates more than half of all ad revenue generated by an individual's time online to their choice of more than 20 charities from across Canada and the US, and now the UK to the tune of 1.1 cents every impression (paid at par depending where the charity is registered...or at least that is the theory...the advertisers to date have been friends and family so I have been covering the 1.1 cents myself).<p>The number of impressions and how you create them is up to you. Simply sharing, viewing or commenting on pictures or ""deep thoughts"" makes cents!<p>Jack also takes a ""softsell"" approach to keeping the charities top of mind among existing supporters, while trickling into the consciousness of potential supporters, as the charities' Twitter feeds have recently been incorporated into their supporters' personal profile pages...viewable to the community.<p>Yes, the name will always sound a little untraditional, but JackTheDonkey.com is working to connect with individuals who are traditionally unengaged from anything remotely related to volunteerism and fundraising.<p>There is another key component to the site that we are rolling out in the near future which will provide an additional stream of funds for the charities on jackthedonkey.com.<p>Please join us: http://www.jackthedonkey.com/Register1.html (and remember to check your spam folder for the activation email).<p>Attached is a copy of my first piece of press that I was able to generate locally earlier this summer:<p>http://null/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ecjnews%2Ecom%2Fimages%2Fstories%2FHeebonics%2FJune_25_09%2Epdf&urlhash=PfME&_t=disc_detail_link<p>Attached are also links to a couple reviews of Jack that were posted recently on a couple startup related sites:<p>http://null/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstartupmeme%2Ecom%2Fjackthedonkey-jacks-every-visit-of-yours-to-support-your-favorite-charity%2F&urlhash=yJkm&_t=disc_detail_link<p>http://null/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ekillerstartups%2Ecom%2FSocial-Networking%2Fjackthedonkey-com-support-a-charity-the-social-way&urlhash=p3FU&_t=disc_detail_link<p>www.JackTheDonkey.com is free for the charities and members of the community, but not for the corporate sponsors/advertisers.

Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) systems are out there but they're generally not trusted.  People understand mags and vacuum pumps and the peace of mind it brings to know you can lose your entire electrical system and still be flying.<p>Most of the FADEC systems have dual alternators, dual controllers and dual sensors, but people still don't run them very often.  Probably the most popular one I know of is in the Rotorway Exec series helis.<p>SDS also sells a (non-redundant) EFI system that's used in a couple of aviation applications.  My dad is using a SDS system in his Jenny.<p>You also can't run a modern closed loop EFI system because of 100LL (avgas).  The lead in it will destroy an oxygen sensor.  So you're still stuck with a mixture lever in most cases.<p>And that's just the experimental crowd.  The cost of certifying an EFI engine into an existing airframe would make a retrofit cost prohibitive.  Most people won't spend an additional $20k at overhaul time to add fuel injection and digital ignition.  It would take a bunch of hours at +20% efficiency to make that back.<p>A couple years ago I heard about a company selling a modern ignition system packaged into a mag.  The idea was to replace one mag with the digital ignition and leave one mag as a safe backup.  I don't know what happened to them.  Last I heard they were selling units and working on certification for the Lycoming O-320/O-360 and Continental O-300 engines.<p>Also, I just looked up the guy in the article.

It is to the point where it would not be crazy to consider building a site entirely within the inspector. While the editor is not as good as others, you do gain simplicity and the ability to patch running code. The workflow is getting better.<p>Writing a great inspector is the hard part. Comparatively, writing an editor should not be as difficult. Chrome built the inspector first and is circling around.<p>The only integration I would really care to see (perhaps via ST2 Package Control) is the ability to directly pipe into the Inspector and patch running code.

And the PATH variable tends to run from applicationy to fundamental, which is the opposite direction to the natural dependency above.<p>> To illustrate the problem, ask yourself what happens if a script in ~/bin invokes an script in /usr/local/bin that invokes Ruby? Should that script depend on the OS installed version at /usr/bin/ruby, or on the personal copy the user happens to have at ~/bin/ruby? PATH searching gives the unpredictable semantics associated with the latter (maybe ~/bin/ruby is a broken symbolic link), while baking in the path to #! gives the former.<p>On the Unix&Linux SX - <a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/11917/5197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/11917/5197</a>",1372223765

If a tea party group does some form of social welfare, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s primarily a political institution.<p>Planned Parenthood, on the other hand, is unquestionably a social welfare organization. It has offices which have doctors who provide a wide range of sexual and reproductive medical services to many women who would otherwise be unable to obtain them. If you look at their budge, 70% goes directly towards medical services. Less than 10% goes towards public policy; and what does, is advocating for policies to be able to continue the social welfare services that they provide, nothing else. Those figures you linked to for donations to political candidates represent less than 0.05% of their budget.<p>Where are the tea party offices that provide medical services to low income residents? Or heck, if you want to be fair to them, where are the tea party offices that provide tax advice to people who want to lower their tax burden? Of course, it&#x27;s kind of hard to come up with examples of social welfare services that tea party groups could provide, because as far as I can tell, the tea party movement is primarily about opposition to social welfare, and a variety of political goals involving the reduction of the federal government. Even trying to stretch my imagination, I can&#x27;t think of any social welfare programs that tea party groups would actually provide. I suppose they could qualify for tax exempt status if they shipped 51% of their revenues to other social welfare organizations that they supported, but that seems more like a tax dodge than an honest assessment of the purpose of the organizations.<p>Now, back on topic, I think that the software groups are sometimes more of a grey area. While there is a lot of open source software that is developed solely for social welfare reasons, there&#x27;s also a good deal that is developed primarily by for-profit corporations. If there will be more than one for-profit company working on a joint project, it is common to set up a non-profit foundation that organizes the collaboration, or use an existing one. On the one hand, this can sound an awful lot like for profit companies trying to claim that their joint venture is actually a social welfare organization. On the other hand, due to the fact that the code is shared publicly and available for anyone to study and modify, it is arguably promoting social welfare and thus should be eligible.<p>If you check the actual recommendation, you will see that they have no specific recommendation for this type of situation; all it advises is &quot;The [sic] is no specific guidance at this point.

There&#x27;s always going to be some performance bottlenecks, I guess I&#x27;m more concerned with how hard are they to identify and overcome than they might have been having coded stuff up in pure java from the start?  Or, once you&#x27;re committed to a design, say refs and STM, and you hit such a problem, is it difficult to change course?",1372222907

There are clear proofs of concept that an accident can be caused by a compromised electronics, and multiple ways to do it. We can come up with endless <i>possibilities</i>, but I was trying to establish likely vs unlikely.<p>In his particular case, an attacker would require Hastings to be traveling at a high rate of speed to have a high probability of a fatal injury. Highland Ave is a 35 mph surface street. So the attacker would either need to speed the car up, or have him already traveling at a high rate of speed. If it&#x27;s the former, Hastings could have just used the brakes. If it&#x27;s the latter, there are lots of reasons why he could crash on a two-lane city street lined with trees and parked cars at 4 am. As you point out, it&#x27;s possible a sophisticated attack could have also provided all kinds of distractions to prevent him from braking effectively.<p>I think the most likely explanation was that he was speeding and lost control, but feel free to disagree.",1372222906

A LOT of people I know have a singular goal in their life: Make X million dollars in shortest possible time and then live off of that for rest of the life. It would be astonishing how much of the activities are generated in software world from this goal compared to other areas of engineering and art. The net effect is large number of short lived and/or crappy products that is designed for nothing but cashing out as quickly as possible. Founders creating companies not to create a long term value or advance humanity or state of the art or make people&#x27;s lives better but find people with money who can be talked in to to shell away some money with promises of future. Someone had stated before that best minds of our generation are busy increasing ad revenue by 1%. I think things are more worse than that.

6112164,comment,6110398,6111503,14,0,acqq,,,"It gives the fuller perspective. The Go libraries are something very new. People who developed the libraries know them inside out. Outside of that group of people, there&#x27;s certainly much less knowledge about them. A lot of the claims in the article about the full coverage of some standard in some Go library versus the incomplete one by the given C++ program obviously come from somebody who invested enough time to study the standards and (at least) study the implementation inside of the said libraries. That is, something like that either you <i>know</i> or you can just say <i>authors claim that they adhere to the standards</i> -- which ones, how much; you can&#x27;t know, much less you are able to compare.<p>So, for me, that is somebody who didn&#x27;t follow the state of Go libraries, it was much bigger new information in the presentation the author&#x27;s certitude that some library covers everything of the standard (good to know how much care was invested there!) than the fact that when somebody has already made some very good tools he can more easily use them then probably anybody else who&#x27;d start without such a deep knowledge.<p>My own takeaway was &quot;now that I know that at least some libraries are very well thought-out that&#x27;s a good argument to consider when deciding about the use of Go in some future project.&quot; Still it&#x27;s to weight against the learning curve and the quality and ease of use of the available libraries in other more common languages. In that light it&#x27;s still good to know that the author of the presentation is really very competent.<p>Not directly related to your question, I also applaud the author&#x27;s honesty in describing the problem he solved: first, the underlying assumptions changed: I can imagine that the main reason for fetching the data to the local disk in 2007 was that then fetching the data directly from the remote storage was much slower than it is now, making his current approach impossible then. Second, it&#x27;s not that the original design was as inefficient as the later suboptimal modifications made it. Third, it was a project in which for a while nobody wanted to invest the time to. That&#x27;s the convenient point to jump in and demonstrate what you can do with the new tools and your knowledge and time. Once you change the equation, a product once almost without the future can become a basis for future much more successful projects.",1374911314

People buy it once and there will be a limited market for it, specifically if you are targeting a niche. Anyone who thinks an ebook is the path to financial freedom is an idiot. You need to find a market you can serve where people pay monthly or have to order your product regularly (something that runs out/gets used up).<p>2. If you&#x27;re aiming for passive income why are you building a team?? When you need something done you hire a freelancer for a few weeks, solve the problem and move on.

When you seek out help for a particular problem, it&#x27;s often a blind-leading-the-blind situation.  How can you learn to program well if you&#x27;ve never seen a good piece of MATLAB code?  Good luck finding good examples and role models to learn from if your programming universe is limited to MATLAB.

They couldn&#x27;t care less about how flexible python (or other language) is, when they already use and know Matlab.<p>3) Matlab doesn&#x27;t make money from colleges or grad schools, they make money from industry customers. Of course the engineers and scientists of those deep pockets get trained at colleges and grad schools.<p>4) If you can write python, c++, or javascript, and if you keep publishing scientific code in that language even when Matlab is better suited, then it is possible that others will come with you. I am rooting for you. Just so you know, depending on the field, if you published your code in Matlab or R or whatever is the most popular for the field, you&#x27;d probably get more citations. Since academia is rounding error in Matlab&#x27;s income, you will only be hurting yourself, if you chose not to use Matlab in a problem that it is best suited for.<p>5) Projects fail for many reasons. But, in your case, could the common denominator be <i>the university</i> rather than Matlab? In universities, it is hard (and I&#x27;d say unethical) to keep students for very long, so a research group may end up with a lot of code without owners if they are not careful.

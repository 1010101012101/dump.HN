In our case, YC said they were worried about a problem we did not think would be a serious issue. We did come up with a solution, but only a few hours later, which, apparently, was too late.",1209472939

176480,comment,175755,176278,0,0,raganwald,,,"First, +1. I think there is a lot of room for debate around this subject, and frankly this was exactly the debate I hoped to provoke (which is why I included a video of Jobs introducing macintosh, a product he really did <i>not</i> create in the engineering sense).<p>Should we be like Woz? like Jobs? Should we strive for a partnership like Woz + Jobs? Hire a ""Sales Animal"" and a PR firm as Paul has described doing with his company?<p>And what is the role of an incubator/angel/YCombinator? Can it help programmers focus on programming? Or is there something really fundamental in ""communicating well"" that is necessary to successfully creating programs?<p>I think there's a lot of room for discussion around this, and I hope it's as productive for you to weigh the various options and outcomes as it has been for me in my life.",1209471680

Plus you have issues with apps putting shared files all over, in different directories, so uninstall is a mess.  Mac install is better in that regard, since uninstall usually means dragging the .app to the trash.",1209471130

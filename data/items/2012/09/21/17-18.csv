4554849,comment,4549504,4549942,1,0,briansmith,,,"> The fact that an MITM or XSS can completely undermine this<p>MITM and XSS are problems with many Web APIs. There are already countermeasures for MITM (e.g. TLS) and XSS (e.g. CSP). They are too difficult to use, and we need to make them easier to use. That is a parallel effort.<p>> outside of the secure RNG -- a definite good thing<p>The cryptographic PRNG is actually the enabler of pure JS cryptography. If all browsers provide only the cryptographic PRNG, then we'll see people implementing crypto algorithms in JS for sure. I would rather we provide them with (native code) APIs that guarantee maximal protection against side-channel attacks.<p>> As long as the server controls how the building blocks are put together, what keys are used and when, etc, the trust model is broken.<p>Even if these crypto APIs are less useful for normal web page use, I expect them to be an improvement for (packaged) installable web apps. We are planning on packaged web apps being protected by digital signatures (at least in Firefox OS) and having a default CSP that prevent the execution of any external scripts.<p>Still, of course it would still be up to the application developer to do all the other things that are necessary for their application to be secure--whether it is using cryptography or not.",1348250229

Why would a millionaire code at a quality he could barely sell in the market (not being a coder), and which is just enough to show a prototype which gets funding, which gets the ball rolling, which... (all the things that lead to the net-present jumping between $20 million and billions, but never lower than the former).<p>So, what is going on here?  Why is the person working at $0/hr producing work that's worth maybe $3-$4/hr? (buggy poor-quality spaghetti code php with no source control, for example.)<p>He is also directly losing a wage he could be earning elsewhere.<p>what is this behavior?  What is going on here?<p>one answer could be, couldn't it, that he's producing low-quality, poor labor, because he has the chance to buy a chunk of a high-quality idea with it?<p>i mean, i personally know of a lot of stories of hundred-million dollar exits that started with an idea that the founder started following up on by-<p>- doing poor-quality accounting and business founding,<p>- poor quality legal research<p>- poor quality coding that had to be thrown away after his company was bigger<p>- poor quality biz dev that was mostly spinning company's wheels<p>a lot of other things of very low quality...<p>... but of quality just high enough that the idea pulls the company through, and his preconceptions can be changed by high-quality lawyers, his code is thrown away and rebuilt by real engineers, his b2b attempts are repeated by someone who can actually push deals through, his logo is replaced by a real logo that doesn't make you laugh, and so forht.<p>so, what just happened in this whole last example?  what was the beahvior that led to it?

4554824,comment,4553658,4554413,3,0,Retric,,,"What a lot of people are missing is ""the market"" can't grow faster than ""the economy"" over the long term.  There has been a huge influx of money into the stock market as an increasing percentage of people hoping for historical returns.  Causing people to chase after ever lower returns.  It's gotten so distorted that the 'smart money' practically ignores growth in favor of other games.<p>HFT is the perfect example of this as they don't chase growth.  There goal is to tax cash flows and market inefficiency.  So, they leave low churn stocks like Berkshire Hathaway alone in favor of cheap stocks with a lot of turnover.  If you keep your stock for an average of 10 years then HFT is meaningless to you.  But, with hedge-funds often doing quite a bit of trading they can extract money without you realizing your trading.<p>In the end it's yet another reason 401k's are growing a lot slower than many people predict.

In college, there will be 21 year olds among the juniors and seniors who can bring in the drinks, and in the work force there will be co-workers 21 and over to do that favor for you.<p>On the other hand, much of the rest of the world has been more accepting of technology to make IDs harder to fake.

When you make something useful for a market large enough to make a successful business out of, there is no mystery.

So you've got algorithms whose attributes manage things like how much of an actual order is exposed to the market at one time, or how much they adjust your bid or ask as the order progresses.  I've got some algo documentation whose algo ""Watch Out For"" notes warn ""may be too aggressive and cause impact"" and ""must watch out for order size that adversely impacts market"".  But maybe you're a trader that decides you want to be ""too aggressive"" with your trade and now you've moved the market because you've used an algorithm in a way it wasn't intended to be used, and your employer's risk controls didn't care or didn't catch what you were doing until it's too late.  Net effect is that your trade may sway the overall market in a way that moved that company, or that company's sector, or maybe the whole market depending on what impact your trade had.<p>And all of that assumes the algorithms behave in a way that they're expected to.

And when high frequency trading is being done by entities with enormous balance sheets, and an increased tolerance for risk due to assurances by the government that they'll be bailed out should they make a bad bet, it's got the potential to destabilize the entire market.",1348247479

It IS a zero sum game between an HFT firm and another HFT firm, or an HFT firm versus people specialist traders. You think that burly guy from queens who used to be a janitor and now works on the floor of the NYSE will give you a good price? HFT cuts the line in the sense that it competes with him to give you a better price.  HFT firms are fast to compete for your business vs other HFT firms. HFT and the average retail investor is not a zero sum game. It is mostly zero sum between HFT and the old system of specialist traders. It turns out the biggest critics of HFT are the old specialists who have lost their jobs and people who do not know what they are talking about.<p>So say you trade against an HFT algorithm. If you are talking about the narrow context of the trade, it is zero sum. But that is not how the world works. Bill Gates can sell a share of Microsoft to a market maker trader/HFT. Say he does this for $26.00. Tomorrow, it goes to $30.00. In the context of the trade, Bill Gates ""loses"" $4 to the HFT algorithm. But that is not the whole story. He took that $26 and did something with it. Maybe he helped fund a startup which has created value and doubled his money. So now the HFT trader is up $4, and Bill Gates is up $26. Zero sum, huh? Or maybe he invested it in a Malaria vaccination program that has no easy dollar valuation but is clearly positive to the world. This is why in the context of the system, everyone can win, and it can be a positive sum game.<p>If you invested your savings 18 years ago for your kid to go to college, at some point you will sell that stock to raise cash and pay for college. You are investing in your child's education, so that he can have a good life, invent things, cure cancer, solve P vs NP, improve Shor's algorithm, and more. That seems like a good return, even if 4 years later the HFT algorithm you sold your stock to made money because the stock went up.<p>When the world changes, prices change as well. As an HFT firm, you are always sending prices that are competitive for customers. HFT being fast is the effort to improve prices as quickly as possible, or admittedly, pull prices if they are no longer fair. Often, this is a typical scenario for an HFT firmnews comes out on a stock that is positive. The old bid for the stock was 20.00. That means if you are sending an order to sell your shares in the stock, to say, raise money to send your kids to a good college, you will hit the bid at 20.00. If HFT is not fast, you will get $20 for your share, even though the news hit 2 seconds ago. HFT algorithms compete for your business in the sense that they try to be fastest to improve that bid price to 20.05. If they are not fast, you get $20. If they are fast, then you get $20.05. What is the problem here?<p>The bottom line of all this misunderstanding is, I believe, a distrust of where all this money is coming from that they make. It's simple--it's from them cannibalizing the old human, specialist trader business (do you know how many billions they made from retail before HFT?). It's no different from a startup upending an old industry veteran by undercutting their prices by 90% and taking away all their business.",1348247075

One level is the general consensus of how should a topic should be taught, another layer is the author's view of how it should be taught In practice there's the third layer, where the teacher presents them in a certain way. This results in a long chain of Simon Says where the final, safe stuff that's taught, for the benefit of the students, mind you, may become very detached from the reality and excitement of the topic. Unfortunately, students always sense this and they tune it out, leading to <i>so</i> many people not liking math, physics, signal processing, you name it.<p>The joy of access to a person who is infinitely (compared to you) knowledgeable in atopic and is willing to interface you on multiple levels and telling you as it is is enormous. Best known such example, of course, is Feynman but physics SE and some other boards come close.",1348246833

I've bought (many) phones from an AT&T store, and I don't ever recall them <i>not</i> opening the boxes for me, tracking down various pieces of cable, throwing out crap.  Indeed, on a few occasions, I just walked out with the receipt, phone and charger - nothing else.  And, when it wasn't an apple phone - that's exactly what I wanted.<p>If you want the pristine ""Apple"" experience, then the Apple store is absolutely where you went.<p>I really, really feel for the author - wish that his day one iPhone 5 experience had been all he had been looking for - I know precisely what that moment of expectation is like, where you actually sit and marvel at the fit-and-finish of the cardboard box, and how the packaging all fits together as you slowly unbox it -  but, AT&T was not the place to do that.",1348246822

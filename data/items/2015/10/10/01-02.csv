To me, Desault Group and Siemens aren&#x27;t really competing as companies with AutoDesk, their core business lies elsewhere, i.e. manufacturing, and their interest in design software seems more of a byproduct of their core interest...e.g. Siemens licenses its parametric modeling technology to other Cad vendors (e.g. Nemetschek).<p>On the other hand PTC is a similarly sized company with a similar strategy of acquisition. It predates Autodesk&#x27;s acquisition strategy and appears to target a different set of customers...hence no webstore. I suppose the analogy I&#x27;d draw is that AutoDesk has products that dominate their market segments in the way PhotoShop dominates its segment. There are competitors for profitable corner cases (in PTC&#x27;s case product life-cycle management solutions), but those aren&#x27;t in the just whip out a credit card and wait for the UPS truck sweet spot.<p>As an aside, my comment mentioned AEC and that&#x27;s a market that Autodesk has clearly shaped and dominated.",1444441874

You even admit you don&#x27;t speak Chinese, so how exactly can you properly evaluate the &quot;ability to think critically&quot;?<p>Your comments are racist because they rely on stereotypes and not facts, and basically have an undertone of racial supremacy (i.e. The Chinese can&#x27;t think critically but we can).<p>You can throw in all the anecdotes you want, but they do nothing to refute facts and data. Your experience as an expat (especially since you can&#x27;t speak the native language) is in no way representative or inclusive of a country of 1.3 billion.<p>By lazily reducing the world into simple racial stereotypes, explained only by anecdotes, you are basically surrendering to selection bias. Every Chinese who meets your stereotypes will reinforce your world view, but you will conveniently ignore or mark as an exception anyone who doesn&#x27;t.",1444438888

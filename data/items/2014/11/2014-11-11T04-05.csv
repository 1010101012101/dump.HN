8588314,comment,8585483,8587191,0,0,MetaCosm,,,"Composition.  That is the single biggest thing that has impressed me as my codebase has grown.  Concurrency and messaging is nice, but I come from Erlang... I am not easily impressed by concurrency and messaging.  Composition, the power of interfaces in complex systems is the key for me.  It is what makes me stay with Go, and why I will probably stick around for a long time.  It is so obnoxiously useful, without ever getting in my way.  Let&#x27;s talk for a second about the tiny little function<p>io.Copy(dst io.Writer, src io.Reader)<p>It reads data from reader and writes to writer... simple.  Now what makes this little function so darn useful is it takes anything fulfilling its interfaces (io.Writer and io.Reader).  The first way you will probably use it will be to copy between some stream and a file without having to eat up all the memory to store the buffer (not using ioutil.ReadAll for example)... but then you realize you can use a gzip compressor on the writer side, or a network socket, or your own code... and io.Copy works with anything that fulfills its interface.<p>As you build out a complex application, you start by creating your own functions that take advantage of existing interfaces foo.OCR(dst io.Writer, src img.Image).  After that you start building out your own interfaces... like a MultiImage interface that has ImageCount and ReadImage methods that returns the count of images and binary data... but then you realize the images could be big, so you make the ReadImage method return an io.Reader... and now you have gone full circle and are using io.Copy to copy imageX from a stack of images to return to your OCR function that will output the data to an io.Writer which you made actually a gzip writer because text compresses well.<p>Beyond composition -- obviously, the concurrency and messaging is nice and when you need it vital.  The other thing that will help make Go &quot;click&quot; is being very &quot;data oriented&quot; in your design... be vicious and minimal: <a href=""http://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc</a> (great talk on data oriented design) and be absolutely pragmatic, focus on getting shit done, always...",1415680467

8588249,comment,8585483,8585483,0,0,Animats,,,"Go has a rather specific purpose. It&#x27;s intended for writing server-side web systems that will run fast and scale well.  Since that&#x27;s what Google does to make money, that makes sense. The available libraries reflect this - good support for dealing with many network connections at once, no GUI support.<p>It&#x27;s not suitable for writing an OS, hard real time, highly generic libraries, or GUI programs.  Within its niche, it&#x27;s far better than the alternative, which is usually C++.  Just the fact that it eliminates buffer overflows without running slow is enough to justify it.<p>There are lots of problems with Go. The concurrency isn&#x27;t safe.  The lack of generics forces overuse of reflection and &quot;interface{}&quot;, Go&#x27;s all-purpose type. The lack of exceptions forces far too many lines of &quot;if err != nil { return err}&quot;, (or worse, a goto) which takes 3 lines of text every time. The &quot;defer&quot; mechanism is clunky. Lots of modern bells and whistles, from functional programming to generators, were omitted.  Other than the lack of safe concurrency, those things don&#x27;t cause operational problems in your data center. They just require more typing by the programmers. That&#x27;s an acceptable cost. It beats spending time in a debugger.",1415678948

As do the British who conquered the possession from the French.<p>These situations are much more complicated than the surface view that the &quot;big evil colonial empire&quot; is picking on defenseless people.<p>If the original wrong of enslaving the population was corrected, the people relocated by force would have never been on the island in the first place. This of course is impossible.<p>There are many more similar arguments for either side that one could make. It just shows the unproductive nature of such disputes.<p>A much more productive approach would have been about compensation and rehabilitation of the displaced persons. Surely there are many things they need that can be provided to improve their lot in life.

Even living in both Manhattan and San Francisco where things are expensive.<p>All the things I enjoy aren&#x27;t really that expensive. You don&#x27;t need millions of dollars to read a book, watch a movie, listen to an album, or have sex. These things are only very marginally improved above let&#x27;s say, the $75K mark. You don&#x27;t even need millions of dollars to go out to eat every night.<p>Money can give you more discretionary time.

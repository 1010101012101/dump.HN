9423151,comment,9419503,9422743,0,0,steveklabnik,,,">  I suspect will get resolved much more quickly and cleanly<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy. You just add this line to your Cargo.toml:<p><pre><code>    hyper = &quot;0.3.14&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnd the next time you build, Cargo handles everything. You can now use hyper like any other library that&#x27;s included with Rust, no biggie.<p>This is one reason we&#x27;ve chosen minimalism for the standard library: It&#x27;s really easy to use external libraries, and once things land in the standard library, they often don&#x27;t improve much. The versions become tied to the compiler versions, contributors now need to build the entire compiler rather than just working on a single library, and everything else. We&#x27;ve already seen three distinct major HTTP implementations happen, had we put rust-http right in the standard library, we&#x27;d have frozen something the author has already deprecated!<p>Choosing non-minimalism has advantages too: in this scenario, you need to know that hyper is currently the best library, for example. Engineering is all about trade-offs.<p>(Solely chiming in on the HTTP in Rust thing here. I found the part of the article about the Gopher... lacking, and it distracted me from the rest of the author&#x27;s points.)",1429732777

It’s not always easy, especially with a client on the phone, but panicking will only make a situation worse. Yes, the most critical server in the infrastructure may have just completely failed without a backup. Instead of focusing on what will happen as a result of the crisis, focus on what needs to be done to bring the system back up. Deal with the results later, after fixing the immediate failure. The fallout of the crisis might be terrible, but it will almost certainly be worse if the immediate problem isn’t fixed. A calm mind can carefully analyze a situation to determine the best solution. Panic responses do not benefit from the same calculating rationality.&quot;</i>",1429732730

At some point we, as a species and civilization, mature to the point where we understand that &quot;thing A&quot; is unacceptable. It happened to slavery, raping (violently or statutory) children, etc... Actual stopping of such things takes time and organized effort and practically happens in stages. It is just naturally happens what the last, most hardest, place of getting rid of &quot;thing A&quot; is where that thing is performed for survival. We know that it is wrong, and many people work to stop it from happening, it just takes more time and effort, and for the time being in such cases for political reasons &quot;exceptions&quot; are sometimes granted - a tradeoff made to minimize evil until that evil is completely eradicated.<p>So in short - it isn&#x27;t &quot;an evil thing stops being evil when for survival&quot;, instead it is &quot;an evil thing is much harder to get rid off when it is for survival&quot;.",1429732677

The business-logic keeps around its own &quot;users&quot; table. The business logic can, and must, index that.<p>Each user then HAS A account; there&#x27;s a 1:1 correspondence. The accounts are in a separate service (a AAA microservice, effectively) that exposes this minimal API where you can only talk about individual accounts to it.<p>How does a backoffice user-management dashboard do its job? Like the name suggests, by reading off the users table—and then doing O(N) queries to the accounts service to effect changes. These sort of one-off administrative operations are allowed to be costly like that.",1429732648

Teach them German or another language which permits words like Stromtarifrechner (&quot;electric bill calculator&quot;) for what in English requires three words.<p>As to the topic at hand, the problem isn&#x27;t due to a change in incoming sunlight, it&#x27;s due to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which decrease planetary cooling. This is part of climatology, which is one word. Or &quot;earth system science&quot; (three words) or systems ecology (two words).<p>> when the body comes under attack, we run a temperature. .... “Planetary temperatures are common when a species, typically a young one, upsets the balance. In some cases the new species integrates quickly and restores balance. In other cases the temperature creates challenges that reduce its population, and sometimes the species is wiped out completely. It’s very similar to the process in the human body.”<p>That&#x27;s a strawalien. Elevated body temperatures as a response to infection appears to be an evolutionarily acquired trait, though we aren&#x27;t sure if it has a direct benefit or is a side-effect of some other response. It&#x27;s not similar to a planetary ecology, which is decidedly non-Darwianian.<p>In no cases did the species integrate quickly to the new balance? In no case did the new species trigger decreased temperatures, of the Snowball Earth kind?

So although you could theoretically declare types in Ruby, it would just be documentation. You&#x27;ll still get the type errors at runtime because there&#x27;s no ahead-of-time typechecking happening.<p>With Clojure you can actually compile your modules while developing them and discover certain classes of type errors ahead of time, so something like core.typed actually makes sense because you can run the typechecker over your code instead of having to run a separate test suite.<p>The main type error you always have to worry about in both languages, though, is accidentally calling functions/methods on nil at runtime.

And even if bandwidth is indeed scarce, then <i>that&#x27;s</i> the problem that needs to be solved by building out one&#x27;s network; punishing users for using the network is not viable in the long term (especially when folks like T-Mobile, as I&#x27;ve mentioned elsewhere in this discussion, are able to offer both throttled and unthrottled unlimited data plans without issue on a network that&#x27;s probably nowhere near as built-out as those of AT&T and Verizon).<p>> Of course, customers may prefer to be insulated in the months they use more data than usual<p>This is exactly why the low-data users in networks like T-Mobile&#x27;s and Sprint&#x27;s typically don&#x27;t mind subsidizing the high-data users (not that they&#x27;re really subsidizing a whole lot, seeing as their respective unthrottled unlimited data plans cost more than their respective throttled unlimited and capped data plans).  Having an unlimited data plan (throttled or otherwise) provides the peace-of-mind that you won&#x27;t ever be charged extra based on your data usage, and that&#x27;s a pretty big win for a lot of customers (especially when coupled with T-Mobile&#x27;s data rollover).",1429731816

Tech companies have high P/E ratios.  Retailers do not.  Amazon is a retailer whose most successful product has been its own stock.  It has developed a skill in the art of propaganda to make it seem like it&#x27;s a tech company.  The amazon Drone April Fools Hoax (that people actually believe is real) is an example of this.    They are working really hard to create the perception that they are innovative so their multiple can remain high.<p>I flagged this article because it is pure propaganda, self serving and right out of the mouths of Amazon&#x27;s PR staff.  This is how they operate.  This is how a retailer whose management has no understanding of technology and who abuses their engineers is made to be perceived as a &quot;tech company&quot;.  They have been engaging in wall to wall propaganda for the past 10 years, using techniques pioneered (and possible the same PR firms) by Microsoft when they wanted to change Bill Gates from the perception that he was evil incarnate into the perception that he was a good guy. (Which worked amazingly well. People seem to have forgotten how he set back technology 10-20 years.  Hell, 20 year olds today were just being born during the height of his reign of terror.)<p>If this story about Sun is true, it shows just how much damage the US government does to the economy with &quot;regulation&quot;.   But since there rest of the article is nonsense who knows.<p>The claim that Amazon has a 7 year headstart is nonsense.  The claim that Amazon &quot;turned cloud computing into a mainstream phenomenon&quot; is nonsense.<p>By the way,  Amazon&#x27;s only service in 2006 was S3.  They claimed (it was a lie, and I know this because I worked at Amazon at the time and was amazed at the boldness of the lie when I saw the press release) that S3 used &quot;the same machines that run Amazon.com!&quot;  Amazon didn&#x27;t seek out to build a business with cloud hosting-- this is just another initiative thrown against the wall to see if it would stick.  (Remember A9? Remember the literally 100+ businesses they have launched and shuttered over the past decade?  The Fire phone is an example of this. They waste a lot of money just building crap to improve their image, make them seem like a &quot;Tech company&quot;)  S3 was actually innovative-- shows what can happen when management at Amazon takes their eyes off of the ball and lets engineers have a little space. (unusual at that company.)<p>What amazon is good at is marketing and particularly to the Hacker News crowd, I&#x27;m sorry to say.   Objectively if you look at AWS it&#x27;s a bad deal all around. The technology isn&#x27;t that great, it&#x27;s terrible when it comes to reliability, and the pricing is not very good either.  Further, they lock you into their APIs which means you have to spend a lot of effort to leave.  Yet whenever these things are pointed out here on HN, people say &quot;yeah, but who has the time or money to run their own servers!!11!&quot;.<p>As if they was the only alternative, as if there weren&#x27;t lots of major competitors from Google and Microsoft to Digital Ocean, Rackspace -- which will give you even more high touch services-- and a million mom & pops. Every feature in AWS was offered by somebody, at scale, before Amazon, and usually without a proprietary wrapper around it.   In fact, most of this stuff existed in one form or another in the early 1990s.<p>Amazon only &quot;Dominates&quot; in the minds of the PR flacks who write these articles and the proof is in the first sentence of the next paragraph:\n&quot;On April 23, Amazon plans to disclose the numbers for its cloud business for the first time&quot;<p>This whole thing is a shell game akin to the one Microsoft played in the 1990s where they bought up all the media, and every writer out there whose audience included CIOs and paid them to say that Microsoft had won, that Apple had no market share, and by doing so persistently for several years (much like google is doing now with android) they convinced people that Apple had less than %5 marketshare.  This at a time when Apple had %25 market share!   This killed many software projects-- I remember being told &quot;there&#x27;s no market for our application on the mac&quot; during that era by marketing guys who knew nothing of the real stats, only what they read.<p>Meanwhile people think android is winning based on ZERO sales data, merely a constantly and loudly repeated propaganda making the claim.   Apple publishes audited actual sales numbers every quarter.  No maker of android phones (that I&#x27;ve found) does so.<p>If you think android is dominating in sales you&#x27;re believing propaganda and have no proof, and probably no evidence. (and don&#x27;t get me started on &quot;activations&quot;.  At one point Microsoft was &quot;selling&quot; and counting, windows for every mac installed in every school!)<p>I see the down votes are coming in, I know to expect this because I&#x27;m daring to criticize a &quot;major tech company&quot; that&#x27;s often mentioned along with Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple.<p>But my point is, we should not be so susceptible to propaganda.<p>This article is just pure propaganda.",1429731672

They both skew heavily toward template languages that are some variation on <div>{{foo.bar}}</div> and require special syntax, which in turn requires editor support for syntax highlighting and such. And Javascript has been the same way until recently--Angular and Ember are template-based by default. And while JSML looks pretty good, I think the other alternative Javascript is trending toward is the JSX approach taken by React, which is basically just backwards templating, and requires a precompiler pass.<p>Meanwhile with Clojure, because it&#x27;s homoiconic (code is data and data is code), all you need to implement a DSL for generating HTML is basic functions and macros (which are just functions that process your source code), no special new syntax is necessary. In fact if browsers used Clojure (or any other Lisp/Scheme dialect) as their native scripting language, there&#x27;d be no reason for HTML, XML, JSON, or CSS to exist at all in the first place.

9422823,comment,9422033,9422272,0,0,Someone1234,,,"I am on T-Mobile and travelled outside the US late last year.<p>First off, I just want to say, the &quot;free tier&quot; of international data is extremely appreciated for two important reasons:<p>- Overage is literally impossible (i.e. no &quot;bill shock&quot;).<p>- If you don&#x27;t wish to pay, you get &quot;something&quot; for nothing.<p>So, now, the &quot;bad.&quot; The reality is that T-Mobile&#x27;s free tier is incredibly slow like &quot;my 56K modem was faster than this&quot; slow. A single modern web-site can literally take so long to load that my phone would fall asleep and then cut off the connection (meaning I&#x27;d have to start all over).<p>It is really only useful for push notifications and to check your email if you&#x27;re really patient. Even for reading sites like Reddit, it would drive you up the wall. Looking at images (e.g. imgur) is a no-go and YouTube is definitely not even plausible.<p>Now, if you pay, you get more data per dollar than you do on most other big US networks and you legitimately get 4G speeds in many places (at least I certainly did). So if you pay you wouldn&#x27;t even know you were abroad. And when you run out of paid data, you drop down to the slow speed again rather than being cut off (which is nice, so you feel safe to use 100% of your paid data with no risk).<p>So, to me, T-Mobile&#x27;s free tier doesn&#x27;t really change the formula for international travel. It just solves overage/bill shock and gives you some basic notifications and maybe email. Those aren&#x27;t things to be sniffed at, they&#x27;re legitimately nice, but people should manage their expectations.<p>PS - Protip: Restart your phone every single time you change countries. My phone got &quot;confused&quot; and would refuse to connect until I restarted. We did a cruise so a new country was daily, and I missed a day of data because I thought that country simply wasn&#x27;t supported (rather than it being a phone problem).",1429729971

That will give you some sense of what to care about and why. It&#x27;s very useful even as a dev or devops person.<p>If you are really serious about being a professional sysadmin, Limoncelli&#x27;s other book is considered outstanding---but it&#x27;s huge and I haven&#x27;t read it yet. Again, it&#x27;s a mix of non-technical goals and technical solutions. The Nemeth book is how I started (though I&#x27;m not a sysadmin) and it&#x27;s also quite good, but more purely technical.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say to a beginner, &quot;Know what every command does,&quot; but try to learn a new thing every day. Keep notes. I like to write private man pages (<a href=""https://github.com/pjungwir/manpj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pjungwir/manpj</a>), but do what works for you.<p>I think learning sysadmin skills mostly just takes time, so try to make each task double as a learning opportunity. Sometimes this requires a lot of digging, or reading, or &quot;debugging&quot;. Here I probably agree with @protomyth: the holy grail is <i>understanding</i>. If you strive to achieve that (and don&#x27;t just go with the first thing that appears to work) you will become better and better.<p>While you&#x27;re learning the nitty-gritty tech stuff, also try to keep in mind the different priorities of a sysadmin over a developer. Both care about reducing their own effort and annoyances. A sysadmin wants stability (no 3 a.m. downtime), automation (easy to deploy/update/scale), transparency (monitoring, logging), auditability (logging), recoverability (failover, backups), controllability (runbooks), security. Maybe a real sysadmin could chime in with what I&#x27;m leaving out. :-)",1429729356

(www.scimore.com if you are interrested)<p>I'm a bit tired of using SQL/Tables/Columns for storage; the perfect solution for me is CouchDB w/ partitioning where you ""just add more servers"". It would be cool to get to the point where we can eliminate memcached and the likes from our infrastructure because the database itself scales just as well.<p>just some random thoughts.",1240991257

584742,comment,583968,584668,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Can you imagine the impact on society of 20k freshman attending some Y Combinator-esque hacker / entrepreneurial program every year?</i><p>I don't think YC could, or would want to, replace college.  The average age of founders that get into YC has increased slowly but steadily...it's now about 25, so folks have been out of school for maybe three years, on average.  pg has said on more than one occasion that he likes founders who know what they're avoiding (corporate drudgery, primarily) by starting a company, and he's found they're better able to hold the line when things suck (which they always do to some degree during the first few months to a couple of years of a startup).<p>That said, I think high school kids who show an interest <i>should</i> be given access to resources along the lines of YC.  A fellow from Tulane ran an entrepreneurship program at a high school in New Orleans a year or so ago, I think as some sort of project for school, and he raised money via a ChipIn to bring the best of the lot out to Silicon Valley to see it all in action.  Several YC companies volunteered to sit down with them for a few hours and talk about the process, and make it seem human and do-able for ordinary non-genius type folks.  He also lined up visits to Google and Facebook and a few other valley highlights.  I'd be stunned if that didn't have a positive impact on at least a few of those kids (underprivileged kids from poor neighborhoods in this case, but I think it'd work for most kids).  Maybe one or two of them have businesses of their own today.  So, I think that kind of thing would be great for the economy and great for the kids...but it's not something you could do as an investment company.  It would take funding that you don't expect to get back, either donated (perhaps by companies) or grants from the government, and involvement by schools.  It's just not something that is going to produce a profitable portfolio...but it could certainly put the kids on the right track.",1240990695

Most men in IT I know would be thrilled to have female colleagues, though.<p>I am not ""claiming"", I just resent taking things at face value. Possibly people are not used to competent IT women, because they are rare. But does it really take the form of ""no, we don't want this person on the team, she is a woman"" (without knowing her)? I doubt that - and if there are companies like that, it is their loss (not all men get hired by all companies, either - and good IT staff is rare in general).<p>Also, bias against the tech skills is hardly the same as sexism of the ""she only is good for porn"" kind.",1240990506

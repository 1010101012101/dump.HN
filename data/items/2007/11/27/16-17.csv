83938,comment,83881,83918,0,0,icky,,,"Maybe a better approach would be to silently gather statistics and find out the degree of correlation between any given user's ""inappropriate"" rating and the actual (as determined by you) inappropriateness of any given item.<p>Then, if someone has, say, a NEGATIVE correlation between their inappropriateness rating and the actual inappropriateness of said item, you can still use that person's ratings as a useful source of information... just not the way they intended ;-)",1196179848
83937,comment,83881,83881,0,0,angryprofessor,,,"You might try looking for controversy. I've thought about this more for reddit/slashdot comments than for polls, but here are my ideas:<p>For comments on a point based site (such as reddit, this site if it gets popular), there are signs that a post is being downmodded by people who disagree. For instance, -10 points, 10 replies. Or 10 upmods, 12 downmods. <p>In your case, this would probably be 10 ""innappropriates"", and another 20-30 people actually using the poll. You might also look for people clicking ""innappropriate"" and then voting in the poll.",1196179760

However I come to realize, after trying to ""convert"" a lot of people around me, Unix isn't made for the ""desktop"" (understand, unfortunately, Windows-clone).<p>I also use Solaris (10, not 11m but still) at work. All the time. And if Linux isn't that great on the desktop, Solaris is a catastrophe.<p>I'm not being very convincing, as the points I'm mentionning would take a whole blog post to prove. My question here is the following:<p>If this article is on the Oracle website, could it mean that the people at Redwood are trying to be more agressive on the desktop market? Or are they simply using Linus' name to attract traffic?",1332763146

3756213,comment,3755418,3755974,7,0,roel_v,,,"""However, I though it would be helpful to start with a proactive thesis to get people thinking about this issue.""<p>Well sorry to sound like a grumpy grandpa, but if anything, this site needs less posts of higher quality, not more empty posts with the explicit goal of provoking replies.<p>""How come the suicide rate in Africa is much lower (close to zero) than in Europe?""<p>First, correlation between depression and suicide is not linear as you seem to imply. While I don't have the expertise to have an authoritative opinion on this matter, depression is much more complex than 'my life sucks'. It's just as much (more?) about 'I feel my life sucks'. Japan has a very high suicide rate, yet ranks high in various happiness indexes, and has first world GDP.<p>Secondly, your claim that suicide rates in Africa are close to zero is flat out wrong, as even a cursory google search would have revealed to you. To start there is the objective problem with getting data - many African countries keep little to no statistics on this. Then there is a cultural issue, which incentivises all involved actors to mask or under-report actual causes of death (this is Greenspan talk for: families report suicides as accidents to avoid the social stigma). Furthermore, even the data that is available and at least somewhat reliable, points to African suicide rates that are not substantially different from countries worldwide. For example, the only African country on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_ra...</a> (Zimbabwe) is somewhere in the middle, just above (meaning: slightly worse than) Luxemburg, the most prosperous country in the EU. While Wikipedia isn't the end and all of data, I found that WHO data paints a similar picture when I looked into it a while ago when I had the same discussion, but that data is a lot harder to distill and I don't have time right now to do so.",1332763110

There is a fork of libumem that has been ported to other popular operating systems, such as Linux, Windows and *BSD systems (including Darwin/OSX) by OmniTI (<a href=""https://labs.omniti.com/labs/portableumem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://labs.omniti.com/labs/portableumem</a>).  I maintain a fork of portable libumem (<a href=""https://github.com/gburd/libumem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gburd/libumem</a>) that includes changes made by Joyent as part of their ongoing work to improve SmartOS.<p>I have deployed this allocator to dozens of production systems to improve the performance of highly concurrent memory-intensive applications (such as Riak) and found it to be an excellent, stable and fast allocator.<p>In addition to fast allocations it includes excellent statistics and memory leak detection (<a href=""https://blogs.oracle.com/pnayak/entry/finding_memory_leaks_within_solaris"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.oracle.com/pnayak/entry/finding_memory_leaks_w...</a>) as well as a few different allocator heap-fit algorithm choices.<p>It is licensed under the CDDL.",1332761587

Fair enough -- Redis is first and foremost an in-memory database.<p>If there was the time though, I'd love to see LevelDB[1] merge the gap between in-memory and on-disk. Inspired by Google's BigTable, all keys are kept sorted on disk (see: SSTable[2]). Keys, lists, sets, sorted sets and hashtables could be encoded in sorted key-value form and would be reasonably (though not tremendously) efficient to retrieve, especially if the query can be converted to a range query (i.e. list retrieval or set intersection). Keep hot data in memory, the rest ends up securely on disk.<p>Yes, Cassandra is based on the same lineage but it's not simple or clean to operate. Redis is a pain free setup, features a simple API but has no transparent way to overflow to disk for cold data.

Usually, I don't read the discussions as much as I click on the links to the articles.  There are around two or four per day that look interesting to me (congratulations, by the way).  Sometimes, I save articles to read later, so by the time I get around to reading an article, it's not being discussed on Hacker News anymore.<p>Maybe when I accumulate enough karma to down vote, I'll down vote some stuff.

Before I explain a technical topic in writing I prepare every sample project beforehand. Complex sample projects are prepared in different versions (starting with the sample immediately after it has been created by an IDE, …) up to the final version. This has two benefits: I, as a writer, can offer the sample (step by step) for download to the readers so they can use them as a reference when something goes wrong - but more importantly: It helps to structure the writing process because I know the steps I have to describe. I know when something essential has happened (because I have created an additional version of the sample).<p>A rough outline created in advance also helps.<p>I am also talking to myself - a lot.

The only explanation for your product having more malware than your nearest competitor's, even though your product is objectively <i>more</i> secure, is that the amount of malware is a function of market share.<p>I agree with you about the downsides of using proprietary formats. However, the power of a general-purpose computing platform like Windows, Mac OS X or Linux is that you can choose to lock or not lock yourself exactly as much as you want to, so I consider it a non-issue. Given that the platform gives you the freedom to not lock yourself into it, to my mind technical specifics and personal preferences for tools become the deciding factor.

My issues are with Android and how it still feels rough around the edges.<p>1) Lack of an integrated mail tool.  I really don't care so much about POP/IMAP folder integration but why do I need two email apps, one for Gmail and one for IMAP.  The stock IMAP client sucks for that matter and I've had a lot better luck with Jesse Vincent's K9Mail fork off the core mail app.<p>2) The pull down notification bar seems clunky.  On one hand it's nice to see at a glance all the things that happened on my phone while I wasn't using it.  However when ""you have unread mail"" or ""missed call"" is mixed in with ""XYZ song is playing"" it gets sort of muddled.<p>3) Deleting an app is quite possibly the most unintuitive thing on the whole phone.  If you're used to just hitting an ""X"" on the home screen from the iPhone you're in for a disappointment.<p>None of these are dealbreakers for me and in general I am still very satisfied with my N1.  However it seems to me that Android is still very much a platform for hackers.  For example, Android has a running process list with an option to kill tasks on the phone. Not so on the iPhone, because the OS developers clearly decided their users shouldn't even have to think about this.",1273517714

More in line with ""every piece of software can be made better.""<p>Here's what's done:  The data model is built, online forms to enter the data, reporting, an easy to administer setup system and accept new clients, easy integration with paypal subscription.  It's a multi-tenant system, so we can have lots of companies sign up and it's fairly easy to add new customers. It can also be packaged as a ""behind the firewall"" system.  It's also built on a flexible platform in case the clients want to add fields or modify the application to suit their needs.  There's a rest-like interface for integration into existing information systems the clients may already be using. Tons of security setups for multiple groups and who which information they can view or enter.  It works on mobile devices so client reps can enter data while out on the road. Lots of pharmaceutical sales people will <i>love</i> this capability.<p>What still needs to be done is setting up the brochure site to sell the product. Create a blog and start adding content to get people involved.  I've bought a great domain name that will help with SEO. There's also some aesthetic stuff like gradients and moving form fields around, but this can be done with drag and drop.<p>It's ready now to do a demo for clients.  My thought is put up a brochure site where potential customers can sign up for a webinar and we can walk them through the site and how it works.

It's true that there are conventions to where certain files are placed, and operating systems often take steps to hide stuff that users shouldn't have to deal with, but these steps are inconsistent and the conventions aren't enforced. While my photo viewer might look in My Documents\Images for photos, my photo editor might look in My Documents\editor workspace. A scanner might use yet another directory entirely. All these programs will drop a user into it's directory of choice, and a user looking for a file that they used elsewhere, will not know that they are in a different directory.

So now they have to implement a mechanism that associates follow requests with follow acceptance.<p>Currently, the exchange is probably something like this behind the scenes:
    me: @restrictedUserIWantToFollow lemme follow you
    them: accept guyWhoWantsToFollowMe

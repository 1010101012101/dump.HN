7761390,comment,7761134,7761134,7,0,Karellen,,,"Pick a Free Software project that you use regularly (possibly one without a CLA to begin with if you want to avoid paperwork), preferably one written in a language you already know, find the bug tracker, and find a bug (or wishlist item) that sounds interesting but <i>really</i> trivial. (No, really. The first time you do this will probably be a lot harder than you think it ought to be. If it&#x27;s not, no problem, pick something less trivial second time around.)<p>Download the code, figure out how to build/install it, and start to find your way around the codebase to try and figure out which bit of code is at fault/needs extending. When you get stuck, ask on the dev mailing list or IRC or whatever comms channels the core dev(s) have.<p>A lot of programming is not about designing something elegant and new. It&#x27;s maintenance work, fixing bugs, extending functionality, adding new features. Sometimes adding exciting new features is a chance to design something elegant and new, but other times it&#x27;s a bunch of repurposing and refactoring some features that are mostly-there under the hood, but need a couple of tweaks, and a small amount of really new stuff (but in the same idiom as the rest of the system) and exposing in a new way.<p>You&#x27;ll really find out how to properly spelunk into a codebase (which is a complementary skill to just reading code), how code is used, and how it solves real-world problems.<p>If another dev solves the bug before you do, that&#x27;s not a problem. The real purpose of the exercise was for you to learn, and only perhipherally to help the project. As a bonus, you can see how the other dev solved the problem, and how their solution differs from yours. Did they solve the bug at the &quot;same level&quot; as you? Was their fix a bigger or smaller change than yours?<p>If you get there first, great! Submit a patch to their mailing list, or a pull request to their git page, or whatever they use. Do not take their criticisms of your work as a personal insult. (If they do insult you personally - which almost certainly won&#x27;t happen, but very occasionally does - that&#x27;s another matter. Drop it and find another project. Life&#x27;s too short to waste on asshats.) Rather, listen to exactly what they don&#x27;t like about the way you solved the problem, use that to fix the problem in a way they will like, and re-submit.<p>Repeat.",1400367573

7761381,comment,7760870,7761246,1,0,rectangletangle,,,"I agree with this. I started with Python, then later learned C. Taking the top down approach has several benefits when learning. You can make programs that actually do things much more rapidly, incentivising continued learning; this can not be emphasized enough. Less time is wasted wrestling with the many subtleties of something like C. Although important, knowing about pointers and memory allocation is unnecessary when trying to get across very basic fundamentals like control flow. Python also acts as a model for good abstractions. If you start out working with Python&#x27;s list type, lists are already a familiar concept when it comes time to implement a linked list<i>, because you understand how it </i>should* work. By the time the student is ready to learn something like C, they already have a solid grasp on how things are supposed to work, so understanding how they actually work becomes substantially easier.<p>*CPython&#x27;s list type is really a dynamic array, and it works better as a stack.

Build something you want to see built and you will learn oh so much. Programming isn&#x27;t about how you implement something so much as it is for what reason.

This isn&#x27;t for comp. sci. students, this is for engineering students.<p>I know that in America, unlike other countries, &quot;engineer&quot; is a non-protected term and that lots of guys who don&#x27;t actually have engineering degrees (such as comp sci majors) call themselves engineers.<p>But &quot;actual&quot; Engineers, i.e. the people who have engineering degrees or are in engineering programs, the people to whom this article pertains, are applied scientists.  By definition, their professional concerns aren&#x27;t the inner workings, or developing a holistic understanding of computers.  That&#x27;s for a specialist, i.e. a computer scientist who has more appropriate training.  An engineer&#x27;s job is to develop a solution that surpasses the design requirements (physical as well as budgetary) by the minimum amount.  As a crude example, anyone with a high school education could, with unlimited funds, build a bridge that would stand up.  But only a trained structural engineer can build a bridge that will <i>just</i> stand up.<p>I&#x27;m a mechanical engineer, and for people in my field the programming aspect is most often a means to and end; you&#x27;re writing a simulation to give you better insight into solving a physical problem, or you&#x27;re writing a program to crunch a shitload of data, or you need to plot things and present them in a particular way or output the results to a particular tool, etc.  The performance of the algorithm or your code is not really paramount.  If it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; then it&#x27;s good enough, because the code you write is just another tool in your toolbox along with your digital multimeter, your impact driver and your wrench.<p>I recently wrote a quick one-off to iteratively determine the asymptotic limit of a set of physical functions with many interconnections and shared variables, subject to 4 different constraints and involving numerous irritating physical constants.<p>To write that program successfully, I don&#x27;t have any need whatsoever to understand the intricacies of file IO, the specifics of how libraries are linked at compile time, or how the print function actually prints to the screen.  All I need is for it to print a number to the console so I can compare it to my far rougher hand calculations.  Anything else is a waste of my time.<p>Had I written that one-off in python, the knowledge that &quot;<i>print</i> prints things to the console&quot; would be perfectly adequate for me to do what I need to do in order to move on to more important things.

I&#x27;ve been a watcher and listener for long enough that I remember when there were <i>far</i> fewer credits and they were much less specific.<p>There&#x27;s the other can of worms about various influencers of what appears (or doesn&#x27;t) on PBS, NPR, PRI, and APM.  There&#x27;s Noam Chomsky having interviews and essays pulled on minutes&#x27; notice from NPR, Koch intervention with IIRC WBUR Boston, and numerous other instances.  I&#x27;ve been noting a general lack of appropriate coverage for well over a decade, though some of that may simply be my own increasing sensitivity.<p>Not that there aren&#x27;t exceptions.  Terry Gross&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, Ira Glass&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Bill Moyers and Company&quot;, and &quot;The Commonwealth Club&quot; tend to provide some of the most insightful programming.  If I had to choose between the news coverage and those four programs (three of which are once a week), I&#x27;d pick the latter.  &quot;Planet Money&quot; has been good but gets washed out when it&#x27;s in a normal news broadcast.<p>Listening to a local station&#x27;s pledge recently I was struck by the comment that the three most-valued aspects of programming were all long-form programs:  a call-in talk show generally committing a full hour to a single issue, Fresh Air, and This American Life.  They&#x27;re also all associated with a single principle personality.  I see this as a call for giving time to explore a topic in depth rather than the several minutes&#x27; limit imposed by other formats (which itself is far longer than most commercial news programs).  Though the non-frantic nature of the programs also possibly plays a role:  these are thoughtful conversations between adults.  I can&#x27;t stand the commercial documentary breathless reporter, hyperbole, and thumping soundtrack format at all (usually encountered through YouTube samplings if at all these days).",1400365364

How many comments are simply disengenous trolling for upvotes?<p>It would be really enlightening if HN decided to stop making downvotes and upvotes anonymous where we could all see the patterns and make the connections between grassroots downvotes/upvotes and systematic downvotes/upvotes from multiple sockpuppets.<p>I&#x27;d love to see that.",1400365360

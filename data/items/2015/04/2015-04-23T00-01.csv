Charging a higher rate costs you customers, and with fewer customers you don&#x27;t even need the extra capacity you just bought. Also many customers are on contracts so you can&#x27;t increase rates right away.<p>In contrast, with pay-per-GB, upgrades increase revenue automatically without losing customers. You don&#x27;t have to increase your rates and you can probably even decrease them and still increase revenue.",1429750691

Unlimited only makes sense if I&#x27;m going to use a reasonable amount of it. These days, I talk barely 20 minutes a month, and I haven&#x27;t sent a single text so far this month. Apps that use data are rapidly replacing both of them, and people who use a Nexus 6 with Google are likely to be at the forefront of this trend.<p>I would really prefer a much lower base rate with <i>zero</i> talk/text and reasonable &quot;overage&quot; charges. Even at the old system of $.30/minute and $.25/message, It would probably come out cheaper for me. The overage charges will also encourage me to use more data instead of talk/text, and isn&#x27;t that what Google wants me to do anyway?<p>(My mother is with a South Korean MVNO and pays a $0 base rate, with &quot;overage&quot; charges at $.0018 per second of outgoing calls and $.02 per outgoing text. Crazy, huh? Pay-as-you-go data is more expensive with her carrier, but she doesn&#x27;t need much data.)<p>All in all, apart from easy international roaming, I don&#x27;t see anything special in this offer. It&#x27;s the same old American carrier racket, only more expensive. I expected more from Google.",1429750576

9424448,comment,9417171,9419955,0,0,garrettr_,,,"> You are saying that if one part of your trust chain is limited to a certain security level, then it makes no sense to make any part stronger.<p>Security is only as strong as the weakest link. My argument is that if your adversary is powerful enough to factor an RSA-2048 bit key (but cannot factor an RSA-4096 bit key), then it is likely they would also be powerful enough to compromise your data via one of the &quot;weaker links&quot; that I described, rendering the stronger key worthless.<p>I am not saying that it makes no sense to make any part stronger, just reminding you that crypto is not magic security dust and bigger keys don&#x27;t necessarily make you safer in the context of an exploitable endpoint environment.<p>The goal of this final part was to reinforce my argument that the security benefits of using a smartcard outweigh the benefits of using larger RSA keys, and so I am encouraging the use of a Yubikey as a GPG smartcard despite the limitation of only allowing up to 2048-bit keys. Hopefully they will support larger keys and/or ECC in the future and we can all switch to that when it is available.",1429750464

9424419,comment,9420991,9424320,0,0,derefr,,,"> Facebook and Twitter: both stupid ideas that now have dominant market positions.<p>No, they weren&#x27;t. They were <i>tasteless</i> ideas. Pundits hate tasteless ideas (because their job is predicated on [being perceived as] having better taste than you), but regular people don&#x27;t mind them.<p>Some of the best ideas are tasteless. The entirety of the casual games industry (a $3bn market) is built on tasteless ideas. McDonalds&#x27; food is (both literally and figuratively) tasteless. Walmart&#x27;s curation is tasteless. Summer Hollywood blockbusters are tasteless. Casinos are the most tasteless places on earth.<p>But none of them are <i>stupid</i>—they all make complete sense, economically. They align with people&#x27;s incentives; it&#x27;s clear exactly why they make money, and it would be easy to imagine their business models working out if they were pitched to you.<p>A <i>stupid</i> idea, on the other hand, is the opposite of something like a McDonalds or a Walmart: something that might be tasteful, might sound great in some abstract/idealistic sense, but is very obviously not aligned with <i>anyone&#x27;s</i> incentives, and so has no valid route to adoption.<p>Pets.com was a <i>stupid</i> idea. People didn&#x27;t want to put in the effort to order household consumables over the internet in 1999. Ordering something over the internet in 1999 entailed an amount of effort about equal to buying it from a mail-order catalogue—and nobody was selling pet food that way, either. The logistics didn&#x27;t, and couldn&#x27;t, work out, without a whole lot of supply-chain scale borrowed from other lines of business, ala Amazon. And remember, pet food is perishable.<p>If the only things you can think to say about an idea are reasons it won&#x27;t work—and you can&#x27;t think of even one cynical/self-serving reason people might use it anyway—then it&#x27;s a stupid idea.<p>If it would be great, if not for [some huge list of flaws], <i>but</i> there&#x27;s at least one person out there in the world that none of those flaws will matter to? Then it&#x27;s not stupid; it&#x27;s a <i>disruptive</i> idea, and the next version will probably iron a lot of those flaws out and become a pretty great idea.",1429749854

Complexity is a highly overloaded term in our field.<p>The difference between complex & hard, easy & simple has been put very elegantly by Rich Hickey in Simple Made Easy [1].  That doesn&#x27;t mean everyone agrees with his definitions, which is why he revives the word &quot;complected&quot; to mean objective interleaving of concepts, and pulls out &quot;hard&quot; from the way people use complex to mean something one is unfamiliar with.  I like his definitions, so I use them. :)<p>> Sometimes it refers to the number of steps a given algorithm takes to compute<p>This can still create ambiguity since it could be either time or memory complexity, but still easy to infer, especially if there&#x27;s a big O.<p>> depth and breadth of a program&#x27;s syntax tree<p>Lisp overloads the parens for difference concepts, which is complex.  This could also be hard if one&#x27;s not familiar with the syntax.<p>> tendency to branch out and create cycles<p>Sounds like time complexity!<p>> Sometimes it&#x27;s mistakenly used to refer to concepts which are in reality simple but merely unfamiliar or non-intuitive.<p>This is the ambiguity, is he saying Haskell complex because it has a lot of interleaving with it&#x27;s concepts, that other languages do not?  Or is it just unfamiliar?  I would think it&#x27;s simpler because it forces one to think about how time interleaves the program, which could make things harder!  I&#x27;m guessing this is what the grand parent means, since ML is impure.

It runs on a Raspberry Pi and works like this.<p>1) I get the video signal from the composite output of my cable box (or any video source), which outputs HDMI and composite in parallel. If that weren&#x27;t the case, I could have used an HDMI splitter and HDMI2Composite converter.  I prefer the composite signal, as its not encrypted, and you don&#x27;t really need to waste processing on an HD resolution signal.  The &quot;resolution&quot; of your LEDs around your display doesn&#x27;t even come close to even an SD video signal.<p>2) The composite cables run into a USB Video Capture card, which I picked up for pretty cheap on Amazon.  The USB card is plugged into a Raspberry Pi, running Raspbian.<p>3) I got the driver for the video card working on Pi.  Then wrote a driver for the LED strip, which communicates over SPI.<p>4) My main program, which is set to run on powerup, will make the video card sample the video signal as fast as it can. I do some image processing on the capture to average the pixel colors in each of several rectangular areas around the border of the image, each assigned to a corresponding LED.  Then I send the SPI signal to drive the LED to that color.  The sampling, image processing, and LED driving is plenty fast that the LED &quot;frame rate&quot; is well above perceptible limits.<p>5) This is all configurable with a config file that accepts parameters for LED layout, how big the area to process for each LED should be, overlapping those areas for smoother color transitions, how many frames to average the colors over (also for smoother transitions), etc.<p>6) The wiring is the simplest part. Power source, split off to a usb connector to power the Pi, the other line split into power and ground for the LED strip.  The strip needs 2 lines for communication as part of the SPI protocol, which are just wired to appropriate GPIO pins on the Pi.<p>Boom. Done.",1429748940

That the big players have an unfair advantage over the little guy?<p>> Really, what we&#x27;re running up against here is the silliness of the term &quot;HFT&quot;. By the definition we&#x27;re contemplating here, virtually every ATS in the world is an HFT.<p>Not really, if it doesn&#x27;t deal with market micro-structure, it probably isn&#x27;t HFT. There are lots of ATSes that do routine things like rebalancing portfolios, or more sophisticated things like automated hedging of human traders, that is still happening at a human pace.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen a detailed article yet that covers how many order modifications he made, and how far outside the money his spoof orders were (really far and it is something he could have managed by hand and I wouldn&#x27;t call it HFT, pennies-close and his London Excel setup couldn&#x27;t have handled it, but I think there is definitely a big HFT Goldilocks zone in there).<p>Look, spoofing is already illegal, and is already a problem in manual trading.  Whether the guy did HFT spoofing or not isn&#x27;t really damning to HFT at all.  It really just shifts attention away from how fast all the illusionary HFT liquidity (tightening spreads and providing valuable liquidity is how pro-HFT arguments normally counter anti-HFT arguments about it a zero-sum game) evaporated during the flash crash.<p>My original comment can shed some light on that.  Part of the regulators&#x27; approach, post flash-crash, to getting more liquidity in events like that was to add more stringent quoting obligations on market makers.  The regulation was already ineffective and poorly thought out, but to get an idea of how much the industry really values liquidity don&#x27;t look at the bullshit they sell in congressional hearings (we pay the market in liquidity!), but instead look at the product they demand as customers of Nasdaq (a new, explicitly anti-liquidity order type).<p>(edit: ok a bit overblown on that last part, I don&#x27;t think the flash-crash was that big of a deal. The HFT industry just really oversells liquidity and it is kind of a farce, the market literally shuts down for two days each week and takes ten days of holiday each year.. literally a near universal zero liquidity for 30% of the year or more if you consider market hours)",1429747759

If you speak English to at least a &quot;working professional&quot; level, it&#x27;s very easy to live and work in the big cities. At least in Copenhagen, the tech-sector work culture is very English-centric, and most official things can be done bilingually (civil servants all speak English, most forms and websites are translated, etc.). Of course there is nothing wrong with learning more languages, but it can be a big issue to attempt to get work and residence in a language you don&#x27;t really speak well. For example I would personally not try to get a job in Italy unless I first learned good Italian, while I think an Italian who speaks English would find Denmark fairly easy, without needing to learn Danish up front (I know this in part because I have several Italian colleagues).",1429747711

Sometimes I will ask the candidate to spot bugs in a function, or read code and say what it outputs, or have a whole function written with one thing missing, and ask what&#x27;s missing.

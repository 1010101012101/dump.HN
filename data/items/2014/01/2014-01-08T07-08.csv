7022315,comment,7021962,7022299,19,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"If you want separate resolutions for computer monitors and televisions you are going to pay a premium for both, since different supply chains are focusing on two different kinds of panel. You want the two industries working on the same thing, and that&#x27;s already happening. I&#x27;ve been 1080p on my workstation for a long time. I can&#x27;t wait for 4K TV monitors and they will be my next upgrade for my workstation once the price is right.<p>My comment up-thread discusses why television shifting to 16:10 is unlikely, and it mainly has to do with lenses. Another concern is all of the monitors in studios, trucks, and so forth that are 16:9. Given that, it seems fair to me to have computing move toward 16:9 so the toolchains can be shared between computer monitors and televisions. My 55&quot; 1080p TV was $2,000 when I bought it. You can now buy it under $1,000. What&#x27;s wrong with taking that experience and working on computer monitors?<p>Computers are increasingly being used to deliver television and cinema content, as well. It&#x27;s fairly ideal for me right now to consume 1080p content at its native resolution with no boxing or cropping.",1389167934

We are given some background information and then told the observation of a particular random variable.  In the given article, the random variable is interpreted as &quot;yes/no: at least one child is a boy born on a Tuesday&quot;.  Rambling about &quot;order&quot; does not change the fact that the article is correct, <i>given</i> the definition of the random variable that is observed.<p>The problem is that this interpretation is only correct if you imagine that you are always given the observation of the same random variable no matter what the genders or birthdays of the children actually are.  For example, if I had two girls born on Wednesday, I would then tell you &quot;no child is a boy born on a Tuesday&quot;.

In particular, notice if your home download starts at full speed, but is throttled to super slow speeds after a couple minutes of video have been downloaded.<p>4) Run a traceroute (I love using mtr for this) to ensure that the route to Youtube from your home machine goes directly from your ISP&#x27;s network to Google&#x27;s network.

If a user <i>is</i> breaking the law or violating the ToS, then terminate their account!)<p>• Having to stop accepting signups in their Amsterdam location for a while because they ran out of IPv4 space but didn&#x27;t support IPv6.  (A message from August 2012 says, &quot;we hope to have something in the works by Q4 2012 or Q1 2013.&quot;  As far as I can tell, they still don&#x27;t support IPv6 in any of their locations.)<p>• Not supporting the booting of custom kernels.  (They&#x27;ve been stalling on this at least as long as IPv6 support.)<p>• Botching their Ubuntu image and having everyone&#x27;s Ubuntu droplets sharing the same ssh host keys unless the user explicitly generated new ones.  (Probably an honest mistake, but that&#x27;s sloppy, especially considering they&#x27;re effectively forcing users to use their distro images.)<p>The recent kerfluffle about not always wiping data after a user&#x27;s disk image is destroyed would&#x27;ve also been a gigantic red flag (that had been doused in kerosene and lit on fire before being run up the flagpole) if it had happened a few months earlier.<p>To be fair, Linode&#x27;s security/privacy record is far from spotless — they&#x27;ve been super evasive about breaches, and their handling of a data leak bug/vuln I reported didn&#x27;t leave me with a super-awesome feeling — but my gut feeling is that Linode sucks <i>just</i> enough less to justify the US$15/month extra.

7022219,comment,7019914,7021693,4,0,SwellJoe,,,"Both yum and apt-get have excellent dependency resolution. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about it. I can remember the days of &quot;RPM hell&quot; (though I rarely found it all that problematic) as I&#x27;ve been using Linux as my primary server and desktop OS since 1995, but yum was in widespread use by 2005. It&#x27;s been a long time since missing dependencies was a thing you needed to think about on any modern Linux distribution.<p>My preference stems from the following:<p>1. yum repos are <i>so simple</i> to create and maintain! One command, one directory, no files except the packages themselves. Contrast this with apt-get...it literally took me weeks to figure out how to create an apt-get repo. It requires several configuration files, which are generally human maintained (as far as I can tell, the docs for maintaining a repo separate from the Debian repo are awful and leave more than half of the process out completely, to be guessed and googled...they assume you only want to add a package to the Debian repo, not create a new one). It is also inefficient as hell. Generating our Debian/Ubuntu repo meta-data takes an order of magnitude longer than the yum repos.<p>2. Packaging RPM is much nicer, IMHO. If you don&#x27;t need patches, it&#x27;s just one file, the package-name.spec, plus the tarball. If it&#x27;s a standard &quot;./configure; make; make install&quot; process, your spec file can be almost empty. The spec file is well-documented (Epoch is tricky, and a couple of the macros aren&#x27;t immediately obvious, but in general, I can answer my questions by reading the docs).  Debian requires several directories full of files for every package, and the documentation is obtuse. Again, it took me a long time to figure out how to package for Debian, and there&#x27;s no good source for what tools you use to create and maintain packages. Wanna sign those packages or repos? Good luck! There are three or four different ways documented, and it was not at all clear which was the right way. I had to dig into the Debian repos to see how they did it, and try to replicate it. I think I&#x27;m doing it right.<p>3. As a user, I dislike apt-gets tendency to want to remove packages based on dependencies no longer existing...so, if Apache were installed to satisfy a dependency in another package, and you remove that other package, apt-get will (with some configurations, seemingly the default) ask if you want to remove Apache. Even if you have a hundred VirtualHosts configured and rely on Apache for everything! I find some of apt-gets other defaults alarming.<p>4. yum has mock. mock is amazing. Building packages for any RPM/yum-based distro with one command and one configuration file (and maybe a custom repo, if there isn&#x27;t already one) is so awesome. As a package maintainer, this would be enough to win my heart forever. apt-get has some kind of fake root thing, or something, but I can&#x27;t figure it out, so I have to maintain a VM for every Debian/Ubuntu version we support. This sucks and is tedious as hell.<p>But, if I had to live with apt-get, I certainly could. They are, honestly, both amazingly great technology, and I can&#x27;t imagine life without a good package manager. I hate Windows and Mac for this very reason. I can&#x27;t believe people think Mac OS X is acceptable, given the awfulness of package management on the platform. Even <i>Windows</i> has better package management than Mac OS X.<p>Some amazing things about both:<p>yum has groupinstall and apt-get has tasks. Super cool! Install a huge swath of packages, for achieving a specific goal (like &quot;Development Tools&quot; or &quot;Gnome Desktop&quot;) with one command. Brilliant.<p>Easily install all the dependencies you need to build a source package, based on it&#x27;s specified build dependencies. How amazing is that? Not only can you install the source code and the config files, patches, and data files you need to replicate the package from source, you can also replicate the needed build environment easily. (Add mock on yum-based systems, and you have packager heaven.)",1389165639

If you were being legal about it, which your comment is a little bit, &quot;actual&quot; 4K is 4096x2560.<p>A &quot;proper&quot; 4K film shown at DCI resolution is cropped by removing lines due to the combination of aspect ratio between film and projector. The trend in film photography, however, is towards the DCI standard; the RED EPIC shoots at DCI 4K while its predecessor, RED ONE, shoots more lines (I cannot recall off the top of my head, but it is definitely larger than DCI because it didn&#x27;t fit in my Media Composer DCI workspace the first time I worked with it; I&#x27;m really reaching in long-term memory so I might be wrong about this).<p>All of that, however, is in the cinema world. Since NHK demonstrated 4K TV a couple years ago, everybody in the consumer electronics world has understood 4K to mean 4x 1080p, arranged 2x2, and that is what ITU standardized in recommendation 2020. That&#x27;s intentional.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to evolve 1080p equipment to 4K TV than cinema 4K; it&#x27;s multiplicative and most of the same equipment can be overhauled. Other resolutions affect aspect ratio, and lenses are a significant portion of the expense of a television camera. You&#x27;re going to have a hard time selling a standard that makes everybody buy lenses again. Don&#x27;t forget that everybody just did to go HD. (The last lens I shot on in news was $20,000 by itself, which is part of the reason the average photog will get <i>really</i> mad at you if you grab it, as people who don&#x27;t want to be videotaped are wont to do.)<p>If a consumer is buying 4K equipment, its resolution is 3840x2160. This will also be the resolution at which 4K content targeting consumers should be encoded, so I&#x27;m not sure what cropping you are referring to. If a DP is buying 4K equipment, its resolution is higher. This isn&#x27;t marketing droids winning, it&#x27;s completely different industries having a different history of resolutions: DCI 4K builds upon DCI 2K as 4K builds upon 2K builds upon 1080p; cinema has always fought for 16:10 while consumer electronics stubbornly fight for 16:9, as well.<p>Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t help this situation by blurring the history of the two, leading to comments such as this one. Cinema 4K and consumer 4K are not in competition with each other, and there was never a chance of 4K content coming out of the camera at 4096x2560 and making it to a consumer display. They&#x27;re for different purposes. It&#x27;s also worth noting that ATSC v3 is still in early stages and is not finalized, which will dictate the broadcast of OTA 4K TV content and pull the industry accordingly.<p>I am aware some 4K monitors have been released to market at cinema resolution. Those are targeted toward film editors and as monitors for shoot work. There&#x27;s also some other crazy markets; an engineer I worked with in television installed a bunch of early 4K monitors, the ~$20k ones, in an air traffic control tower. They like the resolution because screens get busy, he said. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, I merely remember the story.",1389164811

All the code may be in one big repository, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is not well-managed. The code is still modular; code is managed in libraries with clean APIs, and so on.<p>But whether you keep your code in one big repository or many small repositories, you still need to track and manage those the dependencies between the various parts.<p>For instance, when a bug is discovered in library X, you need to know which binaries running in production were compiled against a buggy version of that library. At Google we can say &quot;A bug was introduced at revision NNNNN and fixed at revision MMMMM. Please recompile and redeploy any binaries that were built within that range.&quot; (And we have tools to tell us exactly which binaries those are.) This is something that using One Giant Repository gives us for free.<p>If you were taking the many-small-repos approach, for any given binary you&#x27;d need to track the various versions of each of its dependencies. You&#x27;d also need to manage release engineering for each and every one of those projects, which slows progress a lot (although we do have a release process for really critical components).<p>But like I said, there are relative advantages and disadvantages to either approach. To write software at this scale requires tools, processes, and good communication. Where you keep your code, at the end of the day, is actually a pretty minor concern compared to all the other stuff you need to do to ship quality products.",1389164659

I equivocated for a while between a 30&quot; HP for around $800 and a 30&quot; Dell, and eventually ended up buying Dell&#x27;s u3011 for around $1100.  I also remember thinking how unreasonably high the prices were for large LCD panels and hoping that they wouldn&#x27;t stay that way forever.<p>It was a time when my monitor cost more than my computer.

There is the DCI 4K native resolution of 4096x2160, 4K UHD of 3840x2160, and then there is the 4K in 16:10 at 4096x2560. Of these the UHD is likely to be the thing anyone cares about because it&#x27;s what TVs will use. The native DCI resolution is probably the least interesting, because actual content will have different resolutions in practice depending on the actual aspect ratio being used. In a computer monitor however I&#x27;d prefer the 16:10 version instead of the 16:9 of UHD.",1389164510

As long as everything is lined up properly within the machine then you aren&#x27;t going to have a problem. Hell, even if it is a horrible, cheap, backlash ridden machine it is quite possible to machine something down to 1 thou tolerance provided you are careful and know a few tricks.

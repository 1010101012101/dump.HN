2253455,comment,2253344,2253344,0,0,cscotta,,,"Pushing a language, its libraries, and extensions which have traditionally presumed linear execution into a threaded/parallel world is a minefield. I'd like to offer a few thoughts on some factors which might have contributed to this complexity, to reframe the question of what might constitute the ""best"" concurrency strategy in terms of tradeoffs, and conclude with a call for us to take up the task of reasoning about our programs in a parallel context.<p>We've seen an explosion of interest in non-threaded, single-process approaches to concurrency in the Ruby and Python communities in the past couple years. Much of the difficulty here lies in frameworks, libraries, and development paradigms which were not designed to be threadsafe (or to teach threadsafe programming) from the start. Developers and library authors have for years been able to operate under the assumption that Ruby code in a single process is executed serially and not in parallel. In environments which permit parallel, concurrent execution inside the boundaries of a single process, authors must return to the foundations of what they've created and scrutinize every bit, reconceptualizing their programs in terms of shared state and mutation.<p>Individual developers relying on these libraries must also scrutinize each and every gem they require to ensure that the code is threadsafe as well. This is not an easy task, as reasoning about state is inherently difficult, especially when the original program may not have been designed with concurrency in mind, and even moreso when one was not the original author. Further, we haven't seen a significant chasm between things which ""are"" or ""are not"" threadsafe emerge in the Ruby community, and it is not common to certify one's code as ""threadsafe"" on release. That said, it's commendable that the Rails team has worked diligently to piece through each component of the framework and certify it clean.<p>I do not mean to suggest that multithreaded code written in Ruby is uncommon, unsafe, or a bad idea in general. Many applications running in environments without a GIL/GVL such as JRuby utilize this functionality effectively today. What I'm suggesting is that process-based concurrency (Mongrel/Passenger/Unicorn, et al) is often favored by developers because it eliminates a large swath of potential pitfalls (or rather, trades them for increased usage of system resources).<p>In light of this, we've seen developers in the Ruby and Python communities experimenting with and popularizing alternate concurrency models, not the least of which include cooperatively-scheduled fibers/co-routines and evented programming. These approaches avoid a specific subset of the challenges in concurrent multithreaded execution, while enabling limited concurrency in one process. Matt is quick to point out that these models don't achieve true concurrent parallelism, but do offer significant benefit over standard serial execution. At the same time, they impose a different sort of complexity upon the programmer -- either requiring her to reason about a request or operation in terms of events and callbacks, or to use a library to cooperatively schedule multiple IO-bound tasks within a single VM (which may hide some complexity, but introduce uncertainty by clouding what is actually happening behind the scenes).<p>I wish Ruby and Python the best here. I have a significant investment in both. But as long as developers must ask of libraries ""Is it threadsafe?"" with fear and negative presumption, traditional multithreaded concurrency might not be ideal given the investment required to achieve it safely and correctly.<p>More than anything, I hope for continued complex reasoning and thought on this question. We simply must move beyond reductionist statements such as ""threads are hard!"" to progress. I'd suggest that threaded programming in and of itself is not hard per se -- reasoning about shared state is, and the developer bears a responsibility to either eliminate, or minimize and encapsulate it properly in her code. Evented and coroutine-oriented programming brings its own challenges. Actor models are interesting and may be appropriate for some contexts. STM's pretty cool too, but it would not be proper to hang one's hopes upon something which is not likely to cure all ills.<p>There is no panacea for concurrency. There will always be challenges and tradeoffs involved in developing performant, efficient applications within the constraints of both hardware and programmer resources. We would do well to push ourselves toward a greater understanding of the challenges in developing such programs, as well as the tradeoffs involved with each approach. I think this article is a step in the right direction.",1298447744

2253446,comment,2251705,2253109,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"Having recently been forced to use one maybe I have a little bit of perspective.<p>The problem I believe, is, fundamentally, the need for managers to justify their existence. Whereas other roles in the organization - engineers, salespeople, secretaries  - have clear reason for their existence and work they can point to (code written, products sold, paychecks processed) managers do not.<p>The fact that nobody reads any of these timesheets and that project estimates based on hours are a complete nonsensical fiction are really beside the point. The point is that the very production of this work is taken as proof that the manager, too, is producing valuable work.<p>In small startups timesheets are irrelevant because everyone has their heads down getting on with the job. Managers exist, but the company can't afford to have people who just ""manage"". They do other valuable roles - whether technical or sales or office admin. The sign of a company ""growing up"" is when you suddenly have all these new people you have to report to, with ill-defined titles like ""Product Delivery Manager"" - and the timesheets.<p>OK, but why are timesheet programs so badly designed ? The hardest thing in software development is to design something that's ill-defined - in other words, if the purpose of the program is a bad one, it's really hard to build a good program to fulfill that purpose. Simple timekeeping software isn't hard but management have so many nonsensical requirements that the software increases in complexity and correspondingly decreases in usability.",1298447430

The Forth way is to define constants you need often like this:<p><pre><code>    : 1 1 ; \n</code></pre>\n(that denies a function called 1 that 'returns' the integer 1)<p>With that function in place (3 instructions, I guess), you can replace n usages of the literal 1 (2n instructions) by n calls of that function (n instructions), for a total of n+3 instructions. So, this pays of if n>=3.<p>Oh, and subroutine calls are cheap on Forth hardware (one cycle for a call and zero cycles for a return is easily achievable)",1298444701

Some people just quietly upvote, so they don't have much karma. If you want the upvoting to be more like it used to be, award people who vote similarly like how older users used to vote.<p>It would help take care of the effect where older uses leave due to changing interests etc.<p>Note: I don't actually think it's a good idea. I think just figuring out _what_ you want exactly, in vaguely quantifiable role, is sort of a hard problem. I suspect a lot of people have different 'golden ages' in mind when they think of HN.<p>When I came here originally it was pretty startup heavy, which was sort of remote from what I was up to at the time. I liked it when it got a little away from startup business related stuff (my perception) and toward more generic technical issues. My point is even if everyone agreed that ait has gone done hill (an open question), not everyone might agree on what it should be like. It's not a democracy of course, but even as an individual for my own preferences that seems as hard as the technology issues.",1298444578

Most OSS solutions in this area are basically poor clones of commercial software. Also where will the money come from to fund them doing this full time?<p>I know as one example Ardour is developed full time and is quite a cool piece of OSS for sound editing but it's developed by one guy who can barely pay his bills from the donations, he probably makes what he would at burger king.<p>You would think that computer programmers would be able to design some awesome OSS games right? After all about 50% of my CS class joined the course <i>because</i> they wanted to make games and it's probably one of the most popular topics on any programming forum.<p>Well I can't really think of a single OSS game that has ever really impressed me and certainly none have become popular in the same way Half life or Skyrim has (by OSS game I mean a game that was <i>developed</i> under an OSS model, not something where the code was released by the developer 10 years later or something that is essentially an open source mod for a commercially developed game).",1326959937

This is the first time I've ever written to my congressman, and I'm doing it because I have a very important concern about the SOPA bill that is being debated right now.<p>I completely understand the frustration that the content industry must have with foreign-based sites allowing US citizens to download illegal content. The foreign sites and registrars are beyond the jurisdiction of the USA. However, this completely does not explain why we must turn due process on its head in SOPA. My suggestion is simple:<p>Why not invite the foreign site to participate in an arbitration here under US law, and be given a chance to take steps to avoid getting cut off from US search engines, ad networks, and so forth? If they ignore or refuse, then the US attorney general (or the ITC) can take unilateral action, forbidding US businesses to do business with them. But simply giving them (as well as the intermediaries) a chance to participate in a legal process BEFORE taking unilateral action will rectify the most egregious problem that has everyone up in arms. Even criminals in US have the right to a fair trial before being convicted. And under SOPA, a foreign site wrongly cut off will lose an incredible amount of business yet have practically no recourse unless it proves that the other party <i>knowlingly</i> misrepresented the site as ""dedicated to the theft of US property"" -- something that is practically impossible to do. This lack of due process will encourage frivolous claims under the guise of ""oh, it seemed that way at the time.""<p>If a site has a following large enough to matter, it means that it has been growing for a while. The extra month or so to get a hold of who exactly is doing what, and giving them a chance to decide to get on the right side of US law before cutting them off, will not only prevent us from shooting first and missing, but also enable us to discover and better deal with the site and ALL its subsidiaries and connected organizations. The principle is: it takes time to build big operations, take the time to understand what is going on before taking action.<p>Simply put: by changing one thing in SOPA, it would become much more palatable.<p>Thank you for your time, and I would really appreciate to know what if anything comes of my email.<p>Sincerely,

3483514,comment,3481006,3483272,6,0,reissbaker,,,"""Stealing"" generally connotes taking something away from someone else. With piracy, a potential sale is lost: the pirate <i>might</i> have bought the item were it not available illegally for free. With theft, there is both potential sale loss and property loss: if you steal a car from Toyota, they lose the ability to sell the car to you, and they also lose access to the car itself (which prevents them from selling it to anyone else). So Toyota loses twice, whereas the RIAA loses only once.<p>Of course, the ethical difference is probably larger than simply double. To use an old saying, let us assume that:<p><pre><code>    potential sale = a bird in the bush
</code></pre>
and,<p><pre><code>    access to physical product = a bird in the hand
</code></pre>
As we know from the ancient algorithm,<p><pre><code>   a bird in the hand = 2 * (a bird in the bush)
</code></pre>
Piracy loses a potential sale, and theft loses a potential sale and access to a physical product. Therefore, given the following equation:<p><pre><code>    a bird in the bush = x * (a bird in the hand + a bird in the bush)
</code></pre>
We should be able to solve for x, where x is the amount that piracy is as morally reprehensible as theft.<p><pre><code>    a bird in the bush = x * (2 * a bird in the bush + a bird in the bush)
    a bird in the bush = x * (3 * a bird in the bush)
    a bird in the bush / 3 = x * a bird in the bush
    1/3 = x
</code></pre>
As you can see, piracy is clearly 1/3rd as bad as theft. But, I have a feeling that the above algorithm still doesn't sufficiently illustrate the ethical difference between piracy and theft. Let's try again:<p>With piracy, the RIAA has lost the potential sale to the individual pirate. However, they still can sell the same DRMed AAC file to someone else. With our theft example, not only has Toyota lost the ability to sell to the thief: they've also lost the ability to sell that car to anyone else in the world. Therefore, if<p><pre><code>    X = likelihood of sale to one individual
</code></pre>
and we assume that reduced likelihood of a potential future sale (which is the RIAA's claim of loss) is equivalent to some loss of income, Toyota's lost income is:<p><pre><code>    X * world population * price
</code></pre>
And the RIAA has lost:<p><pre><code>    X * 1 * price
</code></pre>
Meaning that piracy, at the time of writing, is approximately 7 billion times better than theft, and increases in its relative virtue at every moment.",1326957373

But sometimes important files can disappear along with the useless ones. This can occur to anyone, and most of us usually put up with it, thinking that the file is gone forever. However, there is a way out. You can recover deleted files with special software, even after the Trash was emptied. 
Can my Mac recover deleted files?<p>No, it cannot. Unfortunately, Mac OS does not have any built-in data recovery tools. BUT there is a variety of data recovery software that can help you get back your precious files.
When you remove files from the Trash in Mac OS, they are not gone forever. Actually such deletion just frees space for other data, whereas the removed file info still remains on the hard drive. If the deleted files are not yet overwritten by other files, then there's a good chance to restore them. That's why you should refrain from using your Mac until you find a way to raise your files from the dead.<p>How to undelete files Mac<p>Actually deleted files recovery is not the work of a moment. Let's see what file recovery software do when restoring your files. 
First of all it searches your hard drive for ALL retrievable files. In most cases you cannot just enter the name of your file into the search, so better arm yourself with patience.
Once the search is finished, you will see the list of all photos, music, documents, movies and other types of files that can be restored. Now your task is to extract your files from the numerous search results.
When the file is found, you should select where to recover it. You cannot recover the file to the same drive where it was lost. Therefore choose another volume or some external storage device such as a USB flash drive.
Finally, activate the data recovery mechanism. The program will collect the tiny pieces of information, byte by byte, and arrange them to the initial state to recover deleted files. 
To avoid the lengthy process of data retrieval, youd better mark your important files as read-only, or create backup copies.
It has never been easier to restore deleted files on your Mac and best of all, you can scan your hard drive or device and see which files can be recovered for free!",1326956979

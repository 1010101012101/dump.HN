While you can ask questions throughout the entire meeting, this structured window usually comes right after the end of meeting VC pitch.<p>One question that you should always try to ask is whether or not the VC typically makes follow-on investments in subsequent rounds.

If an offer was big enough then each board member would probably have to defend their decision in court from angry shareholders if they refused, possibly against criminal as well as civil charges.<p>So in the event of say a $500 Billion offer, the whole board would have to resign if they didn't want to sell. Where it goes from there I don't know? Of course I don't see anyone offering that much in a hurry.",1202311670

110307,comment,110264,110300,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Possibly, but it depends. Some companies have special restrictions or internal regulations regarding shares and control. For instance, some smaller companies (with only 21 shares issued) may have a policy that each shareholder gets only 1 vote, regardless of the number of shares owned. Others may have a system in place where those serving at the company have more voting power. If I set it up, I could issue you 20 of the 21 total available shares, but because I'm the CEO and chairman of the board, and because the articles of incorporation state that internal shares receive extra voting power, my shares provide me with 90% control of the company. Other companies might have internal controls to prevent a radical dissolving of the board or other establishments in the company. It all depends on the articles of incorporation.<p>As far as external regulations such as the SEC, I don't think there is too much in the way of what you can and can't do with purchasing stock. There is of course the concern for monopoly-like control of an industry, and then someone may step in, but I don't know enough about that to let you know exactly how that will work. In fact, I don't think anyone knows for sure, otherwise Microsoft wouldn't have to worry about their Yahoo! acquisition being shot down.",1202311267

I think volatility as election results come in is about as expected as sunrise in the morning.  In fact, I'd say volatility has been less than I expected, because I thought by now either Clinton or Obama would be above 80%, and instead it's still a coin flip.<p>But if you did want to bet on vol, you would need options, and I haven't seen any derivatives on the election futures markets.  Some cursory Googling turns up nothing.",1202311055

If you can, why not pursue the idea anyway.  If you get in to YC, great.  If not, keep working on the startup and see where it takes you.<p>Why are you taking an internship?  One of the main reasons to take an internship is to get job experience, and I'd say that starting your own business is pretty good resume-able experience.  The vibe that I'm getting in the Valley right now, is that if you want a job, and you have decent skills, you shouldn't have too hard a problem getting it.  It's an employee's job market right now.  So, I wouldn't worry about screwing over your long term job prospects too much.<p>Another reason to take the internship is to get contacts.  But, the kind of contacts that you'd make as an intern probably aren't going to be all that great.  You're better off moving to Silicon Valley, starting your own business and doing the Meetup/conference things.  Networking in Silicon Valley is pretty easy to do, and contacts come pretty easy.  It's really a small town.<p>Another reason to take the internship is the pay.  Which, is usually pretty low.  If you're hard up for cash, I'd say that you're better off taking a coding job for the summer.  From what you've said, though it doesn't sound like that's a big issue for you right now.<p>And, if you're worried about stepping on the companies toes--don't.  Sending them a polite, professional letter explaining that you've decided to pursue other opportunities, should suffice.  If they throw a fit or hold a grudge, you really didn't want to work for them anyway.",1202310491

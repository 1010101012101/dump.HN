Sure, polymorphism is nice, overloading is nice, but all of the programs I have written, have relied on some sort of typing discipline, be it dynamic, static or whatever. I can't imagine writing a useful function for which I wouldn't know what it's type is. Just because Java, C++ etc. implement static typing poorly, doesn't mean static typing has to suck when there are many languages that have inferred static typing, which in my opinion can provide best of both worlds.<p>EDIT: By ""best of both worlds"" I mean ""concise code and the benefits of the program being well typed""",1239043947

With real time media that you can access for modern gadgets that are almost always accessible, there's going to be a constant decrease in need for a paper based media.

Such checking detracts from what you are trying to accomplish and from relying on the exception backtrace to give you a clue of what went wrong when an error occurred. Also relevant is that if you are trying to pass in a new object that should work despite not being a direct descendent of a certain object, by checking for a certain type you restrict the usefulness of the API. Even ""mocking"" a certain object can be more troublesome then.<p>That said, whereas many Rubyists can make more use of respond_to?(), I can make a few uses of is_a?() every now and then.

549328,comment,548741,548741,0,0,arohner,,,"Often I wonder if people are attacking the wrong problem.<p>Personally, my ""DB"" problems mostly revolve around SQL the language, as opposed to the RDBMS model. SQL is a piss poor language for what most developers want to accomplish.<p>1) SQL queries are not composable, and it's a bear to make more  complex queries by building on top of existing queries. i.e. I have a query to find all customers who live in CA. Now I want to find the list of customers who live in CA and bought product Foo in the last year. There are many tools like ActiveRecord and SQLAlchemy that attempt to sweep some of the complexity under the rug, but nothing comes close to covering it in the general case, and once it breaks you're back to writing SQL by hand. I blame the complexity of the language syntax.<p>2.) The SQL model is declarative, which is nice when it works, but really sucks when it doesn't. Being able to look at a query and know whether it is fast or not depends highly on your DB vendor and product version, and is basically impossible without the EXPLAIN command. Writing efficient SQL requires you know that your vendors optimizes <i>this</i> command, but not <i>that</i> command, but only in versions 8.2 and later.<p>3.) Sometimes, I really really want to call map, filter and reduce on my dataset to write my own queries. In some cases, it is much simpler than a page of SQL. Yes, this isn't purely relational, but I don't care. I want fast, simple access to my data, and preferably in the same language I'm using for development . No programming paradigm (imperative, OO, declarative, functional) is perfectly applicable in all situations. So why does SQL declare that declarative style is the One True Way to get access to your data?",1239042872

While this has its commercial advantages (as the author points out in his slide presentation) it's not necessarily the bottom line for every application.<p>The article finishes with, ""Having said that, we still have a thing or two to learn from the physical world."" I would argue the reverse in this case. My problem with the assembly line is that its bottom line is only speed, without stopping to think of time vs. product diversification. Search queries in the cloud aren't streamlining the process to respond the same every time (that's 1.0) they are dynamic (2.0). But the physical world assembly line is very much static.<p>Shouldn't we be applying cloud principles to physical world examples? Why isn't buying a car like buying a computer from apple.com or dell.com? Take a base model, tweak the specs to be personalized, and hit ""make this for me"". The cloud assembly line would then adjust real time to create the personal model. 93 seconds a car? Probably not. Higher rate of sales? Most likely.",1239042623

For instance, Andy Beal, the banker Forbes profiled (that was at the top of HN), saw the crazy deals being made in 2004 and got out of the market. If for the last 4-5 years you'd heard him argue that the fundamentals did not justify the credit bubble, would you call him a perpetual bear? The same happened with George Soros in 1997. He recognized that the stock market had become an enormous bubble, and he began shorting it. He lost a huge sum of money because the bubble went on for three more years. Was his analysis incorrect?<p>No one likes to hear that the party is over, or that things won't go back to the way they were in our lifetimes. During the bubble, people try to marginalize those opinions by calling them ""perpetual bears"". But we're finding out that they were right. It will probably take years for banks and households to fix the holes in their balance sheets. Even if GDP stops contracting, a ""recovery"" will likely be so anemic that it will feel like a recession. And job losses will continue to pile up.

549281,comment,548946,548946,0,0,iigs,,,"The core idea of this article has merit but the analysis of the topic is abysmal.<p><i>Ford invented the assembly line, we're calling it ""Staged Event Driven Architecture (SEDA)"". End result, ninety three seconds to manufacture a car vs one to two days, and over one million cars produced every year.</i><p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say there's never been a way to assemble an entire car in 93 seconds. It takes almost that long to put the lug nuts on two wheels, if you're fast. I believe the ideas of retirement rate and total time to perform are being conflated here. You could get the same thing with 930 teams performing the task the slower, manual way. There are obvious speed benefits to specialization, but the two ideas should not be confused.<p><i>First and foremost, stop thinking about time to complete. Think workflow instead. There is no reason to hold up the front of the line if someone else can do the work later. By deferring the work you cut down your response time, which means snappy user experience, and it also means that you're able to take advantage of the latest industry buzzwords: elastic computing, and real-time web.</i><p>Time to complete is crucial if you need to make a decision about step two with data from step one. For example, consider an order flow: you have to decide whether or not to ship a product based on a credit card approval. Furthermore, if the card is not approved, you'd like to provide the opportunity for your customer to edit their information, rather than just wonder why their widget never arrived.<p>Also, elastic computing is orthogonal to this. If you have 1000 concurrent order flows you could still assign an entire machine to each order flow: very much the ""one team per car"" approach derided above.<p><i>All of the sudden, the cost of hiring / firing another server is zero, and the datacenter (factory) costs are swallowed by the provider</i><p>Vendors are not charities and costs are never ""swallowed"" by a profitable vendor. While analysts love the hand-wavy approach of ""just build everything IN THE CLOUD"", a lot of workloads that would be ideal inside of EC2 (for instance) are great... until you consider the costs. Just allocating one machine and leaving it idle all month is (IIRC) $70ish/mo: vastly more expensive than a non-cloud approach. The win comes when your workload takes advantage of what the cloud providers can do cheaper than you can. Sometimes this means parallelizing the old dumb way instead of spending the time and money engineering a cloud compliant web-2.0+ system.",1239041247

Then they <i>kept dropping</i> for about 2 years.  Each time someone was laid off, they spent less, which meant some other business took in less revenue, which meant they had to lay off people, who in turn spent less...<p>It's too soon to tell, but I'd bet this recession is a lot more like the Great Depression than the 91 or 01 recessions, or even the 80-82 and 73-75 recessions.  91 and 01 were fueled by the bursting of economic bubbles in specific sectors of the economy (S&L and tech, respectively).  73-75 was an exogenous supply-side shock (oil crisis), and 80-82 was because of monetary policy (Volcker lifting rates to squeeze out inflation).  Both 29-32 and 08-?? came about because the consumer is <i>tapped out</i> - they've taken on more debt than they can possibly service, so there needs to be a period of deflation while those debts are unwound and prices readjust.",1239040893

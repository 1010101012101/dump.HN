9181363,comment,9179257,9179257,0,0,dkrich,,,"I tried it and to me the main problem with going whole-hog to a Google Calendar app is that I don&#x27;t think a platform-specific calendar app can ever be as effective as a platform-agnostic one like Sunrise.<p>All things social belong to Facebook, so using a calendar that isn&#x27;t linked to Facebook events is a non-starter for me. Similarly, travel plans tend to belong to Google since I use Gmail, so one that isn&#x27;t tied to Google accounts would never work for me either. Execution and visual design is fine, but I think to most people it&#x27;s secondary to functionality. If the app is causing a large portion of my events to be disregarded, I&#x27;m not going to use it no matter how pretty it is to look at.",1426028383

But sometimes it fails, or results in unintended consequences that we may not notice for years.<p>> Data-driven journalism gave us Buzzfeed<p>> Data-driven music gave us X-Factor and Pop Idol<p>> Data-driven movies gave us 25 Hollywood sequels planned for this year<p>> Data-driven education gave us Key Performance Indicators and Teaching to the test<p>These first three examples are awful examples. A ton of people love all of those things. The only failure of data-drivenness here is the failure to generate content that <i>the author</i> wants. Now, the author can attempt to make some argument about how websites, TV shows, and movies have a moral obligation to strive for whatever objectives the author prefers, but that&#x27;s a separate issue to settle.<p>The fourth example is a little different, because we&#x27;re talking about mandatory education programs for children, rather than products that people choose to pay for or consume.

9181329,comment,9178117,9178739,0,0,venaoy,,,"You attach too much importance to CC chargeback mechanisms. I am a typical American consumer and in 20 years doing about 5,000 credit card transactions I have never had to issue a single chargeback at all. So I know for a fact that I would be willing to use Bitcoin for all its advantages if that meant giving up the ability to charge back. Consider this: credit card fees which are passed to customers by inflating prices by ~2% probably indirectly cost me north of $20,000 over my 20 years of use. I could have saved $20,000 and I would have been totally fine with the lack of chargeback mechanisms in Bitcoin. Even if I end up being scammed one day by a non-reversible $1000 Bitcoin transaction, I would still be $19,000 financially ahead with Bitcoin.<p>Also, CC chargebacks are far from being perfect. In many cases the customer has no recourse for fraud. For example you cannot chargeback a transaction made more than 60 days ago. Some fraudulent merchants stall shipping (eg. claim delays, issues, ship the wrong thing, etc) for 60 days specifically to exploit this fact and exploit the fact customers don&#x27;t know about this 60-day chargeback limit. Or if your PIN code is stolen and a fraudulent transaction is made with the PIN code, you will typically be held liable (check your CC fine print, for example: <i>&quot;If your Password or PIN is used in such a transaction, you will be liable for the full debt&quot;</i> from <a href=""http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/common/pdf/borrowing/revolving_credit_agreement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/common/pdf/borrowing/revolving_...</a>)<p>Don&#x27;t forget that despite the lack of chargebacks, you still have all the other usual recourses available to you if you are defrauded after paying in bitcoins: small court claims, send a complaint to the FTC or BBB, etc. But the fact chargeback mechanisms are rarely needed in the first place, and have various limitations (60-day, PIN stolen, etc) indicates that Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t need them to be reasonably successful as a payment technology.",1426027967

Each is now running through 4 bars of 4 beats, or 16 steps in total. By default the first bass synth is playing a low &#x27;C&#x27; on every step, the second bass synth is playing nothing, and the drum machine is playing a bass drum on the first step of each bar (steps 1, 5, 9, and 13).<p>Laying out a pattern on the drum machine is a little more intuitive, so start with that. The row of 16 buttons represents the steps on which a hit will be played for the currently selected drum type. Buttons for switching modes to edit the pattern for each drum type are listed horizontally (BD, SD etc).\nSwitch to a different drum and add some hits to the pattern by clicking on those steps in the row of 16 buttons.<p>The bassline synths are programmed in basically the opposite way. The 16 steps become the modes you switch between (by clicking the UP and DN buttons under &#x27;Current Step&#x27;) and clicking on any of the the 13 musical note buttons (coloured like piano keys) will select the note which plays on that step.

I’ll show point by point his arguments and why they are IMHO flawed.\nThe thing is, between jokes and memes, and putting some random argument that “looks” have some merits inside, it is easy to fake a sensation of “real content” that is not there.<p>Examples of his points and why I believe they are wrong.<p>1. Redis is too complex and has too many components and protocols.<p>The programming community begs to differer. Redis is an example of a non trivial system software that a single individual can understand and modify easily. Matt points as &quot;thins to parse&quot; to CSV fields with a space inside, and as a &quot;yet another protocol&quot; to the cluster bus that uses a C structure sent over the wire, for which using the normal Redis client protocol would be extremely suboptimal.<p>2. We have obligations towards Redis users but for Salvatore Redis is hobby++.<p>Actually his vision about merging stuff liberally is exactly the irresponsible practice that should be avoided. Not only he does not spend time to improve the basis and doing serious code reviews to other peoples code (or if he does, it does not show up), but also often his own code is written in an informal way without understanding the cascading side effects he could have. Yet he focuses on adding things to Redis, not checking what the bugs could be. There are other people contributing in a different way. For example Sun He fixed a number of issues in Matt&#x27;s quicklist code just reading the code as soon as the code was posted. To be responsible is to write sane code, and especially, instead of writing just new code, focusing a lot into fixing existing code. Another thing that is for me extremely odd is fixing things with a commit that happens to work, and commenting that it apparently works but the reasons are not clear and hand waving about a &quot;possible&quot; cause. For me this is not system programming.<p>3. Focusing for 5 minutes on the README -> README.md switch is just not having points.<p>4. Delay of Redis Cluster.<p>Even if this was addressed many times with: we had a not good enough single-node story to focus on Cluster so this was delayed many times is apparently not enough. It is clear and obvious, so citing this again and again is just an attempt to find an argument to attack.<p>(there is more but useless to continue -- it is clear it&#x27;s a very different POV)<p>So what to do to improve Redis? To do the <i>actual work that is hard to do</i>, reviews, fixes, small incremental improvements, submitting code that is designed well in the first instance, and so forth.

After all, the history of sciences have given powerful heuristics to reduce the solution space to generate hypotheses to solve or explain problems or facts.

You could write &quot;strict&quot; code that would work at the time (due to browsers not actually enforcing strict mode), but in the future the same code might break in conformant releases of those browsers.<p>That said, these days it&#x27;s invaluable. Getting errors early saves time and prevents subtle bugs. It&#x27;s become a widely accepted best practice, as noted by other posters.<p>I definitely share your concerns about mode switches, but as long as there&#x27;s a conformant implementation to test against, it seems like strong mode could move the language forward without <i>too</i> much of the &quot;use strict&quot; early adoption pain.

My favorite latest example:<p><pre><code>    extern crate threadpool;\n    use threadpool::ScopedPool;\n\n    fn main() {\n        let mut numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\n        {\n            let pool = ScopedPool::new(4);\n\n            for x in &mut numbers[..] {\n                pool.execute(move || {\n                    *x += 1;\n                });\n            }\n        }\n\n        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, numbers);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis allocates a mutable array on the stack, and then creates a threadpool which adds one to each element of the array, four threads at a time. We need the inner {}s so that we know that the pool is done working before we try to print the result. Yes, mutable pointers into the parent stack frame. But, the compiler can verify that this is absolutely safe. Say, for example, that we left off the inner scope, so that the pool might not be destroyed and therefore join before we try to print out the array. That&#x27;d be racy in most languages. In Rust, it&#x27;s a compile-time error:<p><pre><code>    error: cannot borrow `numbers` as immutable because it is also borrowed as\n    mutable\n         println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, numbers);\n                          ^~~~~~~\n    note: previous borrow of `numbers` occurs here; the mutable borrow prevents\n    subsequent moves, borrows, or modification of `numbers` until the borrow\n    ends\n            for x in &mut numbers[..] {\n                          ^~~~~~~       \n    note: previous borrow ends here\n    fn main() {\n\n    }\n    ^\n</code></pre>\nRust knows that you&#x27;re still holding a mutable reference to the array, and so taking a new immutable one could case a race.<p>As you can see from the `extern crate`, this pool isn&#x27;t a compiler built-in: it&#x27;s a library. There&#x27;s actually a secondary implementation of a threadpool that makes some different choices internally. But this kind of safety can be gained in whatever concurrent code you&#x27;re writing, and you can write new concurrent abstractions and ensure that they don&#x27;t have data races.",1426026042

At the other extreme you try to model non-stationary processes and all that and have rigorous control over sources of error. In the middle is where I see many companies with, say, A/B testing, believing they have a high level of statistical rigor but not actually achieving that rigor in practice due to many uncontrolled sources of error.

While I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with everything Matt says, his perspective is unique - he&#x27;s the only 0.5 core Redis developer in the world and his contributions to the project are mostly inspiring and certainly of quality. From what I&#x27;ve seen, he&#x27;s devoted to Redis as much as anyone can be and takes the project very (too?) personally.<p>Matt&#x27;s presentation skills are also kinda unique - he uses at least 2^32 slides in every talk, and these are mostly filled with cartoons/memes that I&#x27;m too old to recognize mixed with geeky jokes that he makes up by himself (&quot;What is the favorite food of villains? configs.&quot; - brilliant!) (remember that even making up a bad joke takes considerable talent.)<p>However, between the puns and laughs, his talk is honest and his messages are clear. He usually (I missed the first 2m of this session [i.e. first 200 slides] but I&#x27;m guessing he did it this time as well) opens with an apology for his upcoming rants. Then he delivers sharp criticism at what he perceives to be faults based on his 1st-hand experience. Instead of accepting the &quot;facts&quot;, he challenges them and tries suggesting creative approaches to solving these problems.<p>Yes, he could be a better politician but maybe he doesn&#x27;t want that (anymore?) - it seems that he wants to make the (Redis) world a better place by acting. He uses shock to deliver his points, and perhaps that&#x27;s excessive at times, but I give him the credit because he tries practicing what he preaches. Matt has his reasons for choosing this rhetorical style - maybe he&#x27;ll change it after this experience (although mostly likely he won&#x27;t) - and quoting out of context is often ill-perceived even when well-intended, but when you listen to what he says rather than the how, he certainly shines a hard and clear light on some uncomfortable facts. Perhaps these [facts] are immutable, perhaps they can be tweaked and optimized for joy - I can&#x27;t claim I know any better... but he definitely stirs things up and ignites thought-provoking discussions... and perhaps that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed.<p>I don&#x27;t think Salvatore should or can be &quot;replaced&quot; by Matt, or by anyone else for that matter, until if and when Salvatore decides so. I don&#x27;t believe that anyone with an IQ above 42 seriously thinks that Salvatore hasn&#x27;t been or isn&#x27;t committed to Redis. I didn&#x27;t interpret Matt&#x27;s talk as a coup attempt but rather as the continuation to previous discussions about scaling Redis&#x27; development. I can&#x27;t imagine Matt was thinking that he&#x27;ll be overthrowing the Benevolent Dictator during Redis Conf&#x27;s last session - my impression of the talk was that in his own Matt-ish way, Matt was trying to shock everyone, and specifically antirez, into action to better things. It is the maintainer&#x27;s right and obligation to choose between merging, cherry-picking from or even entirely rejecting Matt&#x27;s orally-submitted PR, but I really don&#x27;t see that PR meant as a personal attack.

Or not&quot;.<p>Sort of like a work contract where the employer has ultimate power and absolutely no rules to govern if they even have to pay their employees at all. Of course, there are labor laws against that sort of thing in developed countries, so tipping is just a way to circumvent those labor laws.<p>It would be much better if those people were simply paid what they should be paid by their employer in the first place, and the terms of that were bound by labor laws.<p>I personally feel dirty every time I tip - it almost feels like being at a strip bar or something similar.<p>(To be clear, I always tip, because the people in those jobs rely on it.

No advanced features are required.  It often results in poor performance and redundant code that is hard on the eyes.  You will get what you deserve, but sometimes you don&#x27;t have a choice.<p>Here is an example of the horror:<p><pre><code>    WHERE (:1 IS NULL OR :1 = item_id)\n      AND item_num BETWEEN NVL(:2,0) AND NVL(:2,9999999999)\n      AND item_date BETWEEN NVL(:3,&#x27;01-jan-1900&#x27;) AND NVL(:3,&#x27;31-dec-4712&#x27;)\n      AND item_name LIKE NVL(:4,&#x27;%&#x27;)\n    ORDER BY\n      CASE :5 WHEN &#x27;NUM&#x27; THEN item_num WHEN &#x27;DATE&#x27; THEN item_date ELSE item_name END,\n      CASE :6 WHEN &#x27;NUM&#x27; THEN item_num WHEN &#x27;DATE&#x27; THEN item_date ELSE item_name END\n\n</code></pre>\nEdit: I suppose you could also parameterize the ascending vs. descending sort, although I have never tried.  My first thought is to duplicate each line in the ORDER BY clause: one bind parameter for ASC and another for DESC.  Have each CASE return a constant if the bound value is NULL, and then bind NULL for the direction you do <i>not</i> want.  Yuck.<p>I am not advocating any of this but am pointing out that bind parameters can be abused in surprising ways if you are backed into a corner.",1426024872

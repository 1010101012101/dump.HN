It is compatible with emacs because there shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or vi(1).<p>> mg is just a text editor with Emacs-like bindings which is not worth much to me.<p>It is of worth to me when I need to edit files on an other machine than my own, I've got the basic navigation and edition bindings embedded in my nervous system (even more so as they're also the edition shortcuts of standard Cocoa controls)<p>> Also, the 'vi' on most unix/unix-like systems aside from Linux these days is nvi, not vim. which is about 200K, not 2G.<p>I said 2M not 2G.

There is an awful lot more to learn, trust me. Hopefully you will take courses on operating systems, data structures and algorithms, building a compiler, etc. Learning different paradigms like functional programming and logic programming will give you different perspectives on computing and make you a better programmer.<p>I teach computer science to undergraduates and students like yourself sometimes have problems to start with (hopefully this won't apply to you). This can be because they've picked up bad habits (PHP?) or because you breeze through the first year and get bored or get in the habit of thinking they know it all.<p>Anyway, computer science and software engineering are definitely subjects worth studying at university level. There are deep intellectual challenges involved in mastering the material and universities are the place to tackle them. If you just want to get a job (programmer as tradesman, like a plumber or whatever), do that instead. There are some situations in which the tradesman might have an advantage over the scientist, but if you're going to write a system for me I want to know that you understand complexity and so on and so on.",1368892630

There's a push to make something that 'works' or 'goes over'.<p>It's easy to make something reddit likes: start by trying to generate non-advertising content and see if you can get <i>that</i> to float, then move on to advertising.<p>No one here talks about the general content Reddit likes, because people in this thread don't seem to care.  The fact that I had to spell out that ""good"" means ""in the context of Reddit"", i.e. ""something Reddit likes"" rather than some objective artistic assessment of what's good already shows what I'm talking about.<p>Basically, if I wanted to advertise on Reddit I would start by trying to integrate myself in that community.<p>Same as HackerNews.  If I wanted to advertise here I wouldn't question the prevailing wisdom here - I'd regurgitate it and say obvious things to get modded up.<p>It's not about ""lowest common denominator"" - it's about respecting people as people rather than as a captive eyeball.<p>Likewise if I were making youtube pre-clip advertisements the #1 metric I would care about isn't conversions: it's, ""can I be good enough and on the same frequency as my audience that they see I respect them enough for them to continue to watch?""<p>The Dove advertisements are a good example of advertising done right.<p>It's not ""objectively good"" - objectively, it's very, very bad.

So, objectively it's terrible.  It's faked.  But in the context we're talking about, it's very, very good.

5729291,comment,5728296,5728296,35,0,brudgers,,,"This suffers from the issue that other introductions to Emacs* - including the official tutorial - suffer from: a focus on Emacs community mores. It skips over the idioms that make Emacs important and focuses on the predicate <i>tribe-member?</i><p>The power of Emacs is being command driven. The command for moving to previous line is:<p><pre><code>  previous-line\n</code></pre>\nThe mini-buffer is where one enters commands. The command for switching focus to the mini-buffer is:<p><pre><code>  M-x  \n</code></pre>\nTell the new user what is really going on. To move to the previous line:\na) enter the command <M-x> to switch focus to the mini-buffer\nb) enter the command <previous-line> to move the coursor\nc) after entering the command, focus will return from the mini-buffer to the invoking buffer.<p>I don't have a hangup about calling <alt> ""meta"". New users already have somewhere to hang the mnemonic. On the other hand, until they have somewhere to hang <C-x p> it's not a mnemonic, it's just a weird way of doing stuff. In fact, giving the learner <previous-line> gives first, them somewhere to hang it.<p>What is typical of tutorials is that they jump past the well considered abstractions of the Emacs code, right into a set of customizations that made sense for the staff of MIT""s Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1979. These customizations were based on expertise with the software; the limitations of console interfaces with no drop-down menus, etc.; and most importantly many years to develop shortcuts on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis both for practical reasons and for the simple joy of productive laziness.<p>Perhaps <next-buffer> and <previous-buffer> are canonical illustrations of the way in which Emacs tutorials are more based on tribalism than pedagogy.<p><pre><code>  C-x <-\n  C-x ->\n</code></pre>\nCould just as well be <C-b p> and <C-b n> or for that matter <M-b p> etc. or <M-x p> etc.<p>In the late 80's I went to vocational school to study architectural drafting, in no small part in order to get my hands on AutoCad. Part of that interest was AutoLisp. The best way to explain the idea behind AutoCad is that it was Emacs for vectors. And to some extent it still is, but there are increasing layers of abstraction. The important point is that it was and is command driven.<p>At the time I started with R10, there was no command aliasing except via Lisp expressions. So the alternatives were using graphic menus or typing full commands - e.g. ""line"" for the line command, ""polyline"" for the polyline command, ""circle"" for the circle command etc.<p>AutoCad output was controlled by pens and pens were mapped to the colors displayed by objects on the screen. The typical use was to map different object colors to different pen weights in the output device (in fact this was the only practical way to vary line thickness produced by the output device for a large number of objects).[1]<p>Now, pen mappings pretty much needed to be standardized within an office because object colors were embedded in the drawing database, and despite their arbitrary nature, the number color mappings one needed to remember were small, they all displayed on screen like crap, and one only dealt with them from time to time.<p>As I switched between firms, each firm had their very own mapping of colors to pen weights. Each office's ""standards-guru"" would justify their selection of color->thickness as being obviously logical.<p>""Red is obviously the color for the widest pen because it is color index 1."" [2]<p>""Blue is obviously the color for the widest pen because it is looks the darkest on screen.""<p>""Yellow is obviously the color for the widest pen because it is looks the brightest on screen.""<p>""Red is obviously the color for the narrowest pen because it is color index 1."" [And so it goes]<p>The logic underlying Emacs shortcuts is identical. It doesn't make sense beyond, ""This is what I like."" All of it is subject to change - even M-x and C-x. That's the power, and that's what should be taught to new users.<p>What makes the application of the logic bad is that the number of ""What I likes"" and since the command language is completely customizable via elisp, there is no justification of standardization of shortcuts except within the Emacs tutorial infra-structure. I.e. it is simple just to copy the previous tutorial that was written for the AI Lab's undergraduates on work-study in the fall of 1982. It is somewhat analogous to the ""standards gurus"" who prohibited changing the command alias c->circle. Though they were more frequently ignored.<p>[1] Certain types of objects [traces, poly-lines] had a width property inherent in them and could be used reasonably for small data-sets or special cases.<p>[2] Colors were indexed from 0-255 with ACI[0] being ""byblock"" so the logic was actually faulty.<p>* it also suffers from the fact that it is poor graphic design and poor typography, in my opinion. I'll leave aesthetic points about learning Emacs starting with leaving Windows for an OS with Vim as an exercise for others.",1368892299

5729253,comment,5728832,5729104,11,0,pmorici,,,"Government organizations tend to focus on treating all of their employees ""fairly"" or ""equally"".  That typically manifests itself in some odd outcomes.  Among them is very little individual accountability.  Some amount of consideration is typically given to ""years in service"" when handing out promotions or salary increases.  Very few people are ever fired and the few that are typically have to commit an egregious fraud like not showing up for work and claiming they did. Showing up and doing nothing or near nothing will keep you happily employed with regular salary increases.  If there is a down economy and they need to cut jobs they do it on a strict seniority basis, most recently hired, out first.  The net effect is that over time the only people that leave are the ones good enough to get a better job where their above average ability will get them a higher salary.  What you end up with is a large organization of average to totally incompetent mid-career to older workers and a segment of newly hired workers, typically younger, with a wide range of abilities.<p>If it is even legal for a government organization to make something to turn a profit, in many cases it isn't, the chances that an organization run like that would produce even the stupidest of successful money making apps is unlikely.  On the off chance that they did succeed the cry from private industry would be so incredulous it wouldn't last long.",1368891378

It'll help you validate your hypothesis and attract co-founding candidates:<p>+ Interview 50 customers per week. No exceptions.<p>+ Build out a business model canvas and test each assumption against customer interaction.<p>+ Learn some basic web development.

5729156,comment,5723865,5725633,1,0,kruhft,,,"After reading up on Lisp macro programming (PG's on OnLisp and others) you will see that it is always advised to use only purely functional code when doing metaprogramming. In Common Lisp and all the others Lisps I've seen, this is not strictly enforced by the language and only advised.  The code should be purely functional because you don't know when and how many times it can be called by the compiler leading to some grand mysteries when something does not go as expected during compilation due to unintended state.<p>The constexpr design is taking this to heart and enforcing that the code to be purely functional.  I don't see this as a disadvantage but take it that designers of C++ are forcing best practices for the features they are adding.  Best practices are generally not the most convenient, but by doing it this way, they're giving you less 'rope to shoot yourself in the foot'.  Lisp was more of a research language woring as a testbed of features that are now moving into mainstream languages now that there is some experience with how to use them in the least damaging way.<p>Purely functional programming is not as 'easy' to write because almost everyone learns imperative first, which is the most natural way to code (do this, then do this, then do this,...).  Using functional code requires you put the control that you would normally put into code into the <i>data</i>.  It's a different way of thinking and is not natural in the way that imperative programming is.<p>And regarding that implementing constexpr wsa a 'nightmare for compiler writers', it should be!  Strong abstractions are difficult to design and implement, but once they are complete everyone benefits.  Compilers are the one things that should take on the hard features since everyone uses them.<p>Thanks for your experiences with constexpr and I'll form my own opinions of it after some practial use and maybe i'll find it just as lacking as you do in the end :).  I'll stand by my statement that C++11 is heading in the right direction, even though it may have some warts and tradeoffs that it can't  be avoided, like anything that matures.  It will be interesting to see what C++ goes in the next 10 or more years.",1368889448

The debt of a company is higher in the capital structure than its equity (creditors come before shareholders in bankruptcy), so it's a more conservative investment. That's not to say that any bond is safer than any stock, and there are plenty of bonds that are very risky (companies have credit ratings just like individuals and countries). Keep in mind also that bonds tend to have a minimum purchase size (usually $10k face value) and minimum increments thereafter ($1k usually).",1368889317

The other guys would talk to me but they could only do so much- across the country, neither could really help with this venture.<p>And I don't have a problem mentioning my last venture although it failed because it wasn't any of my doing that caused it to fail- I ended up in the hospital and unable to attend to the startup for a period of time, where it became necessary to sell its assets to cover hospital expenses & rent instead of continuing it to completion. I'm still proud of how far I got with it, I was a year away of being able to support myself with it. And I would have if I hadn't gotten sick.<p>I kindof do think a grand is alot of money, but I know base don my last startup that it only goes so far in a startup. I do tend to think its possible to get a foot in the door with 5k though. Which is my goal with this project. Right now I only aim to make enough to be able to slowly grow the company, so making enough to save half & reinvest it will make me happy even if its $250/month.

There&#x27;s actually only a single death sound for each type of monster.* But for some monsters, the game plays it back at a random speed--also changing the frequency, like an audiotape on fast-forward--so it becomes a brief shriek, a drawn-out groan, or something in between. This gives an impressive variety of sounds without adding extra memory-heavy samples.<p>Hardly anyone was aware of this as far as I can tell, which is a testament to how well it worked. I only noticed it when playing a goofy little mod that turned zombie sergeants into Energizer bunnies and played the &quot;still going&quot; clip when you killed them. The effect is obvious when there&#x27;s actual speech involved.<p>*Not counting the &quot;splatter&quot; sound when you gib any of the gibbable critters.",1429847872

The problem with Waterloo co-op is how rigid the system is to 4 month only terms.<p>Four months is barely enough time to get a good grounding of what work is like at that company, and the company itself looses out on training someone and then having them leave after a short period of time. For large companies, that works fine because it&#x27;s an investment into whether you would be a good full-time hire. But it&#x27;s not universally helpful.<p>I&#x27;ve found that 8 month co-ops are the most ideal. Less running around, you spend a good stable 6 months doing work (depending on the company) as a full-time employee would, and the company benefits from it as well.<p>Co-ops in general though teach you how to pack light and not carry unnecessary baggage.

Three of us were a bit clueless that you couldn&#x27;t build a compiler in a year, but we ended up doing it.

But did you know why it didn&#x27;t happen?<p>1) External factors A: Singapore gained independence at a time when its neighbours were all hostile. Malaysia wasn&#x27;t exactly friendly (though not overtly aggressive), but Indonesia <i>was</i> overtly aggressive. LKY described Singapore as a &#x27;Chinese ship in Malay waters&#x27;.<p>2) Internal factors: It is important to remember that at the point of independence, after announcing the separation from Malaysia, LKY was brought by special branch under guard to the Istana. He was forbidden from returning to his residences for fear of Malay retaliation. It&#x27;s easy to forget that, at the time, Malay Nationalism was strong amongst the Malays. The risk of race riots were real.<p>Combining 1) and 2) together, you can see that cancelling Malay would have jeopardised Singapore&#x27;s security - both from within and with its surrounding neighbours. Also, the status of the Malay language is <i>still</i> a contentious issue in Malaysia today. (This is complex, and has something to do with the concept of &#x27;Ketuanan Melayu&#x27; in the Malay archipelago)<p>3) External factors B: Singapore thought it would be an advantage to have its citizens be multi-lingual, in line with its status as an entrepot. Therefore it would be in the best possible position for trade: with China, with which it has maintained good ties, with India, with which it celebrates its 50th year of diplomatic relations this year, and with its neighbours (Malaysia is still the largest trading partner, as of 2014).<p>Personally, I am able to communicate in English, Chinese and Malay, which gives me an advantage when doing business in SEA.

They tend to be given a title like &#x27;technical officer&#x27; and their role is to do the engineering with a bit less maths and a bit more hands-on experience.<p>Recognising and upskilling the best tradestaff into these roles is one of the most important aspects of a successful mechanical design organisation, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. They deliver a critical insight that your degree-educated, never-worked-away-from-a-desk engineers simply lack, because those engineers haven&#x27;t spent years bending and cutting steel to understand exactly how far you can push the processes.<p>Example: I&#x27;ve just finished redesigning a proposed lifting device where some idiot engineer had specified steel bent in a radius of half its thickness. Any manufacturing tradestaff will tell you this is complete insanity as the rule of thumb is ~1.5-2* thickness as a minimum radius - any tighter and you rapidly start tearing the material apart along its grains. It&#x27;s just not done. Yet there&#x27;s clearly an engineer out there who didn&#x27;t even consider it and sure enough, as soon as we crack tested the bent area, about 1/3 of the items had cracks.<p>This is the critical stress area of a proposed lifting device so that&#x27;s basically a cardinal rule broken, because the manufacturing defect (the tear in the metal) will propagate into a crack over successive lifting cycles until the whole thing breaks in half and the several tonnes of load it&#x27;s supporting falls back down.

We had to do all kinds of versioning to make sure that a demo which was recorded with one version of Doom/Boom/MBF/etc. was faithfully replayed with the current version. One tiny mistake, and the whole demo could go into a tailspin. This sometimes meant we had to preserve bugs like Lost Soul stuck-in-wall bugs.",1429844488

Not with voluntary ability to leave for any reason one might like. Just a medical excuse from attendance, like a person with acrophobia would get from a field trip to the roof of a skyscraper.<p>And again, even then, it might be better for those people to just leave the university campus, or avoid coming in the first place.",1429844480

I installed it on my Gear Live, and it pops up a &quot;Heart Rate&quot; notification, that until acknowledged leaves the heart rate sensor on. (the green light underneath).  This would obliterate the battery.  It needs to do it&#x27;s thing, and go away, not wait for me to tell it to, or even notify me at all.  I&#x27;m not sure with the API if this is possible or not, but for now, I&#x27;m sorry.. it&#x27;s just not usable.",1429844433

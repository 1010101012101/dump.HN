I'm an engineer who currently mostly does computer programming.<p>My main area of programming interest lately is model-building with a high level of non-programmer involvement. In practical terms, that means I build lots of spreadsheets...I even I wrote a set of Excel VBA libraries in order to build spreadsheet models like ""real"" software - that is, as modular, testable, maintainable computer programs. The libraries extend what is already a non-programmer-friendly, declarative functional calculation system into a true functional programming system. With them, a modeler/programmer can:<p>- define true functions using an Excel-formula-like syntax\n - treat functions as first-class values that can be stored in Excel cells, passed to functions, returned from functions, and - most importantly - participate in Excel's ordinary recalculation\n - work with lists and tables of Excel values in a functional way\n - unit-test functions, formulas, and spreadsheet modules<p>Please see the Background section of my Stackoverflow Careers profile for more information:<p>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jtolle<p>The best way to reach me is by email:<p><pre><code>    email = [name]@[domain]\n    name = tolle.john\n    domain = gmail.com</code></pre>",1283218607,1450207814

Just curious: are you being paid by PPP?<p>While DEPENDING on TC coverage for the success of your start-up is a bad plan, I can vouch that TC coverage 4 days after launch put us AT LEAST three months ahead of our ambitious growth plans.<p><i>SOLELY</i> a result of TC coverage did those bizdev emails start coming in from folks very high up at mainstream corporations. <p>",1174094340

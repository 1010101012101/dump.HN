Well said!<p>As for the frustration you have by observing people doing mundane tasks; I bet every person who has had some decent exposure to programming have felt this way at some point (i.e ""re-entering parameters by hand in excel""). And this seems so prevalent that sometimes I wonder if people should be force-fed process automation in their daily tasks. Say, we start from schools where children are deliberately given such exercises where where they have to perform tedious tasks; and then they are taught to spot and come up with ways to automate in order to speed up. Organizations could also have such culture in place where they constantly look for things that may be unnecessarily consuming employees' times, etc.<p>PS, obviously I am not talking about programmers as it's in their mindset to try to optimize any work they're confronted with.",1308279010

There are just too many physical things that separate the dangers of BitCoin and hoarding money somewhere in your house.<p>- I don't have to worry about 6,500,000,000 people having access to my house. At most, there is a market of around a million or so who would live in close enough proximately to me.<p>- I don't have thousands of people across the world tapping on my windows to find out how easy they are to break into.<p>- I'd trust the chances of a local thief being caught more than a hacker across the globe stealing BitCoins being caught.<p>I could go on and on.<p>Right now, the BitCoin landscape is like the Wild West, probably even worse. Systems simply aren't in place to really protect people, and you have the potential to steal from anyone in the entire world.<p>In real currencies, we have systems in place to protect holders. In the U.S. we have the FDIC, which insures bank accounts up to a certain amount. This insurance incentives people to keep their money in banks instead of the house because it's safe (both physically safe from theft and safe from bank failure). My understanding is that there are BitCoin ""banks"" but there is nothing guaranteeing these deposits. There are also established systems in place to help prevent theft. Police departments, close physical proximity to others (neighbors being able to see odd activities), etc. to prevent thefts.",1308278924

So for the past few months they've been trying to embed Rosetta into it instead, and if it goes well they may re-release the PowerPC codebase with Rosetta attached.<p>It surprises me that Quicken's code was written in such an irreparably PowerPC-specific way that it justifies months of Rosetta integration work. Intuit previously had experience developing Quicken on 68K (Mac) and Intel (Windows), and had just undergone the 68K-to-PowerPC transition, so PowerPC was hardly their one and only architecture.<p>Wild speculation, but what if the problem isn't really how the code is written, but that the developers who understand Quicken 2007 are gone. (What if even the people who understand how to <i>compile</i> Quicken 2007 are gone?)

The group at Vintank are hardly 'middlemen wanting some biz dev money'. I've had the pleasure recently to meet Paul Mabray as I'm currently diving into the wine world myself with an idea I've already pivoted on once with, and I can say with a lot of confidence that these aren't just another group of marketing guys trying to make a buck. Paul has a phenomenal reputation in the wine world and is one of the preeminent voices when it comes to discussing how to bring the old way of thinking by most wineries to the new ways of social media. If things went down as Paul described, then Scvngr snubbed a whole industry, not just one company.<p>Edit: Vintank also share the same passion for unifying and making wine 'facts' free for all in the same way that SimpleGeo does with location data. Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes in the wine world knows the horrible state of fragmented / incomplete wine facts (not reviews,tasting notes,ratings) and how that holds the industry back as a whole.<p>Just trying to paint a picture of who Vintank is for those here who don't know.",1308278451

Asking for data points from successful entrepreneurs for comparison with an unknown market is pretty silly to me and shows lack of understanding of your own value [2].<p>An example of value would be a Ferrari. Although a Ferrari costs more to make then the average car, the sale price is far higher. Why? Because the average consumer associates high sale price with premium value.

It also forces sites with embedded content to implement hacks, converting img and other embed tag uris specified as http into https uris.  But if the underlying page is loaded over https, obviously you either want to try getting the resource over https or not at all.  What other sane thing is there for a web app to do other than convert all such uris from http to https when serving a page over https?  Many uris will break that way, but it's better than not serving any of them.  And, if that's the only sane thing for a webapp to do in that situation, why not put that logic into the web browser?  As I mentioned in reply to gst, browsers supporting HSTS already have several modes of ""force https for a uri specified as http"".  Adding one more hardly seems like an unacceptably ugly hack.<p>Regardless, embedded content sites that would be swamped if all requests were over https, and sites that map <a href=""http://foo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo</a> and <a href=""https://foo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foo</a> differently, are going to have to figure out solutions, or they'll stop being embedded as more sites enable https.

Not 'first revenue' but actual profit - enough so that you can stop burning savings or other people's money to pay yourself or your employees. This means successfully and repeatably finding potential customers, and getting them all the way down the line to 'paying customer', and enough of them (say 2000) to be actually paying you money.<p>I think most of us follow DHH or Tom Preston-Werner and convince ourselves that we can build a real business overnight while consulting/juggling on the side. While clearly this has worked for them, it seems to me now that stories like this are the exception not the rule. The rule is closer to a long, slow grind to eventual success that can take years.<p>Obviously ""How long before we're profitable"" is a very subjective question, especially when we're talking about an idea which is sufficiently novel that the size of the market (and therefore the cost of reaching it) is unknown. It's almost pointless to even guess in the early stages.<p>But at the same time, getting the figure right is the difference between success and failure for most startups. Having some good idea of your distance to profit informs if you need to raise cash, and how much, and from whom (and on what terms).<p>Rather than try and build complicated models to try and predict profitability on essentially unknown quantities, I would much rather just see more data points from existing companies to help make an informed decision. Frustratingly, this is the one thing that already successful entrepreneurs seems reluctant to talk about.<p>My actual question then is a bit simpler - who can provide examples of how long it took for a number of SaaS businesses - such as those that frequently come out of HN - to become profitable? What was their revenue at that point (eg. did they have 2 staff or 200), and most importantly how long did it take?<p>Share examples, if you have 'em, here.",1308276886

The thread's chrome hack alone reduces the usability of https, to the point of (I would guess) encouraging sites to use http and disable https so that visitors can actually see embedded content.  Average web users know nothing of https, but if they happen across a site using https and embedded content doesn't show up, they'll blame the site.  Certainly _that_ is not good.  If this google hack is truly worth the pain, and even a small fraction of embedded content works with the uri changed from http to https, that's a benefit because it makes https more usable.<p>Would you think the same about simply changing the HSTS header so that sites could tell a browser to force loading all embedded <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> content through <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a>?<p>It seems to me like Google's long-term goal is to encourage tls everywhere.  If all sites that have user accounts (thus logins) are using https, and all content embedded on those sites has to be referenced over https (or another secure protocol), that's probably the bulk of the web.<p>So the long term costs (in the far future) are an irrelevant cruft of a hack that ends up doing nothing because there are no <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> resource links anywhere.

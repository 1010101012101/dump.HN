There is the saying ""vote with your wallet"" and Apple has the power to get people like Foxconn to live up to expectations, just by using their (Apple's) wallet.<p>What is unfortunate, and hopefully going to change is that some corporations are not interested in human rights, but instead their bottom line - which is understandable, as they have shareholders etc -. However companies like Apple do have a moral obligation to make sure that their products do not negatively impact the well being of human life, and this should be a part of Apple's business plan/strategy.<p>I think what woz is talking about is that human rights should be included as a factor of the bottom line, and Apple should be taking charge in making this happen, lead by example.<p>Another company that does this, is Patagonia. Their mission is:<p>""Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.""<p>This obviously relates to environmental concerns, however ""cause no unnecessary harm"" also has human elements.

Normally, the title is perfectly centered all the time. You can look at how far the window extends to the right, and assume it does the same on the left.

It does make it harder, because anyone can come in and buy one copy to distribute to everyone else, but this happens very often in the non-open-source world too. Maybe you've heard of pirates?<p>The only difference is legal ability to sue, but then again when your unwanted re-distributors/pirates are the masses whose real-world identities are hard to discover, this difference doesn't mean that much. You can also gain some (though not all) of the same legal rights to sue unwanted re-distributors by trademarking your application, which forces any re-distributors to have to redistribute under a different name (CentOS instead of RedHat) which puts them at a marketing disadvantage.<p>Is your example of developing a niche feature for a niche domain really the traditional way? I guess so, but since the GPL has been around there have been numerous examples of what-would-have-been-proprietary features still being developed, released, and open sourced. e.g. if you own all the copyright to a GPL program, some niche domain representative can come along and you can sell them a non-GPL license to develop their addon for which they can then resell. As another e.g., look at all the companies who have contributed to the Linux Kernel. The company wants a particular feature because they can use it to make money for some other reason, so they pay developers to write the code which then gets GPL'd. The company still makes money from the code, the developers make money by writing the code, and the users directly, obviously benefit from the code being there as opposed to the company having estimated indirect guesses at how much value they could capture by selling the code for what the market could bear.<p>Edit: I do agree with you about the irony, though.",1332196785

For example, today, Amazon acquired Kiva. On the Internet, there are a lot of sources that will post this news. It'll flow from top of the line news blogs (TC and GigaOm) to people who simply reblog stuff to gain traction on their blogs.<p>On HN, within a span of a few minutes, two people posted the same topic, one a report from ZDNet and the other from TC (see http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3726164 and http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3726172)<p>This is counterproductive. Both posters got a good number of points for posting those items, but HN is not a numbers game.

(I do a lot of web development, so I routinely have four or five different ones installed. It's just a question of where I keep my serious bookmarks etc.)<p>As a web developer, I'm fed up of the moving targets and unreliability. When Firefox pushes an update to everyone and breaks something fundamental, it's not the Firefox support desk that gets complained at when the web apps stop working.<p>As a user, I see little real advantage from the breakneck pace of development anyway. Inevitably only a few sites use bleeding edge features within weeks of their appearance, and most of them seem to be web design/web development blogs showing off about bleeding edge features that might one day be useful to real web sites.<p>Moving to silent updates, as done by Chrome, might reduce the hassle, but then we'll also see endless minor UI tweaks happening at apparently random times like Chrome, which is really annoying in itself. And of course if a major bug gets pushed out and breaks a site I care about as a visitor, it's just as annoying whether I manually updated (not that there's much choice if security patches stop for anything more than five minutes old) or it happened silently in the background.<p>I never recommend Chrome or Firefox with the auto-updates. In fact, we explicitly don't provide customer support for them any more on several projects I work with, that conclusion being reached independently by several different development teams after experiencing all-too-similar problems.

The omnibox, polarizing though it may be, sets Chrome apart from every other browser as far as U[I|X] goes.  Oddly enough, <i>that one feature alone</i> is enough to make it my default browser.  Were FF as fast as Chrome, I'd still use the latter because I just like using it more.  Chrome's sandboxing, V8, and other intelligent features are just icing on the cake.<p>This, ultimately, confuses me more than anything about the other browser vendors' reaction to Chrome.  They've copied or are copying just about everything about it: short release cycles, better JS engines, sandboxing... but not the one definitive UI feature that has made it so attractive to so many people.  This surprises me.  I would have though Apple, at least, with its commitment to minimalistic UIs, would have been quick to hop on that train, but no dice.",1332194580

Major version upgrades used to be a big deal and brought lots of publicity even outside narrow tech circles. Now they aren't going to get that for free. Google pushes Chrome a lot in ads, Firefox don't have that. So what are they going to do to spread the word?",1332194544

3726509,comment,3725302,3726050,3,0,azanar,,,"A candidate who is at an elevated risk of being replaced by severance, which is a position most new hires are in, is probably putting their aspirations on hold while you figure out if they are the right fit. Severance is typically enough to keep an employee above water for a time while they find a new position that fits them better, but it certainly isn't anything people can build dreams on top of.<p>I think there is a common point of view that wants to assume that recruiting a good fit is something that you determine based on a set of input, and then commit to. If you have to reassess at a later time, and especially if you have to reverse your decision, you've failed at recruiting, and in a way that is preventable in a deterministic way. Experience suggests that people who believe this do one of two things: either they attach an ethical weight to the employee/employer relationship that means you have to weight the cost to your business against the cost to your sense of self-worth; or, they have gotten lucky enough up to this point to meet/interview/hire people who have not misrepresented themselves or otherwise projected an image that they would be much more valuable than they proved to be.<p>Having been involved in a number of instances in the last two years that have exposed me to the randomness of recruitment and hiring, even using all of the hacks people use to remove the error, I'm honestly a little surprised that people can have any imperatives about recruitment. The whole things seems at best stochastic, and errors are <i>unpreventable</i>.<p>I think the reason why people are so reluctant to man up is because it means they failed at something we believe they shouldn't fail at. I would argue they've failed as something we all fail at, and that accepting that will make the whole process better for everyone.",1332194441

I wouldn't say they don't innovate - or at least they mask it real good. Farmville is full of new stuff that ties in together all the time, but general framework looks to be less keen on innovation.<p>I wonder how long can they run with it though. It's like where you have an ultra strong brand for games and you innovate by pushing various forms of gameplay scenarios (think of mario in various games not related to original genre mechanics). Farmville is just like the opposite, brand is the mechanics and framework.<p>Seasonal stuff they put in is the only innovation over original concept they snitched from Harvest Moon and alike. So I guess farmvilles ultimate fate likes where genre-locked games go - e.g. fighting games (street fighter, mk...) where original fad fades away and leaves in core player group.

Every now and then I take a peek at such list. It helps me increase and/or reinforce my knowledge around the area.<p>Before committing anything, I double-check everything, refactoring the code I have modified/added. This is easy because, once you have your new functionality or fix working, maintaining the new correct behavior as you modify the code is low-risk if you do it step by step.<p>English, as being my second language, is an important part of my job. I try to read all the books, blogs, movies, and so on in English. Every time I come across a new word, I look it up in wordreference (plugin for chrome), and add it to a list in Sidenote (mac app). When I need to communicate through email, I sift through that list looking for words that may fit in my message. It is a simple practice that has helped me out big time in uplifting my skills (of course I share this list with my friends!). Certainly this not directly related to programmig but, as I see it, if you want to improve as a programmer, you're going to need to become rather fluent in English.<p>Writing a blog. Especially invaluable when you get feedback of your posts. Folks out there shall give you a kick in the ass more often than you expect. Expect and embrace them. It's a great way to grow up.<p>Get to know that the finest blogs, books and people are in your domain. For example, years ago I programmed in Java, usually building web sites with the help of very known frameworks (Spring, Struts, you name it). I thought I was quite competent until I come across a book called ""Effective Java"" by a dude named Joshua Bloch. Needless to say I was struck by it and I ended up feeling like I knew nothing (literally). You can't program in Java and at the same time not know who Bloch, Goetz, Unble Bob, and so on. Same with Lisp and Norvig, Siebel, Graham.<p>I always strive to keep up with the basics. This is the killer skill that shines when everything else I try fails. With a new technology, starting out learning the ropes from the top abstraction layers makes me feel competent because I can get my job done, plus or minus. Basics alone aren't that helpful, but when something arises that steers from the standard way of doing the stuff promoted by the top abstraction layers, a great deal of the times I will need to dig right into the core in order to be able to solve my issue.

In the course of this, I learned far more about clothing sizing than any sane person should know. I can tell you that vanity sizing is something of a myth - it's really size inflation.<p>What's happening is this:<p>Consumers have an expectation of being able to buy the same size forever, and buy clothes accordingly. Size 34 waist 10 years ago? Just grab size 34 from the rack. Of course, people gain weight and should go for a larger size. But they don't - they still see themselves as a size 34 and keep buying it. And complaining or moving on to the competitor when it doesn't fit. The problem is even worse for women's clothing for reasons too lengthy to go into here.<p>The only reliable solution is a system similar to the European standard, EN 13402. With this system, the fit tolerance (range of body dimensions it is designed for) for the item is listed on its hang tag. This gets away from issues like styles that are designed to have very large amounts of ease, or elastic fabrics.<p>For those that are thinking of building a product in this space, another thing to keep in mind is that most customers just don't care that much about good fit.

I have tried to get used to Objective-C but after using C# for the past 4 years or so, it just seems uncomfortable with me (probably a personal bias that cannot be generalized). I was considering developing my startup's first mobile app in Android since I did not want to touch Objective-C and go with an iPhone Web Page.<p>Considering the number of developers on the .NET/C# bandwagon I think we will be seeing another Gold Rush to the app-store. I really hope the app-review board can filter out the ugly, form and buttons type of applications that will come as part of this rush. Otherwise, AppStore will be the next Tucows.",1284044575

It seems like this type of business is mostly covered in Entrepreneur magazine, or Inc, but they're always feel good success stories.<p>I helped build a fairly successful online business that sold a single laptop accessory which we had produced, packaged by hand, and sold directly to consumers. The site generated 60k in yearly revenue on somewhere between 5-10k (Christmas peaked at 20k+) unique visitors per month. The margins were really good since we had it produced ourselves and priced high. It was great business while it lasted but I ended up walking away from it because of partner issues.<p>My old partner still operates it today and it's nearly 4 years later!

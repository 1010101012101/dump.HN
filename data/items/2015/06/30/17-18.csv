9807195,comment,9806317,9806696,0,0,zanny,,,"> On a PC, a CPU and GPU combo with comparable specs at the time of release would be what? 3x that?<p>Its hard to actually figure that out since the Xbone / PS4 APUs are pretty shoddy Jaguar 8 cores with mid-tier GPU class shader clusters tacked on. The A10-7850k right now retails around $125-$130. It has four Steamroller cores at 3.7ghz unlocked, versus 8 Jaguar 1.75ghz cores on the Xbone one. It has 512 shaders at 720mhz, compared to the xbones 768 at 853mhz. The more expensive 7870k just ups the frequency at stock to 866mhz. Of course the GPU is also unlocked on these parts so you can just run that 7850 at identical or higher frequencies to the xbone (I have a 5800k running at 4.5ghz / 1066mhz cpu / gpu respectively, it just takes a better cooler).<p>The more significant difference is the 32MB of embedded ram on the xbone SoC, whereas you need expensive 2400mhz+ DDR3 to really get results out of Kaveri, and that still isn&#x27;t going to come close to the throughput of the xbone.<p>All things considered it probably exceeds the Xbone in theoretical CPU performance by quite a bit, whereas real world it matters less since game engines can just hyper-optimize their pipelines across the eight cores to minimize the benefit of four beefy fast cores.<p>So to answer your question... it would probably cost $150 retail if AMD made an APU that just dedicated more die to GPU and got, say, 1024 shader cores on there at 1ghz. Basically an r7 370 on die. The Xbone almost kinda has an r7 360 on board running at 4/5 the frequency, by comparison. Then they just throw four or eight Carrizo cores in there (the mid range not-desktop not-mobile skews). The 370 is basically a faster 265 (same chip) and those are selling for $100 on the lower end, probably $90 without shrouds, and probably $80 at break even sales. And you don&#x27;t need to fab the PCB or bake in any dram, so the per-volume costs of those shader cores is probably half that. You could even throw some embedded dram in there to make the gpu faster like the xbone part for probably $20 averaged.<p>And when I say $150, I mean releases for $150 MSRP and sees price cuts putting it at Xbone rates or lower within months.<p>> I buy mid-range video cards exclusively and that&#x27;s a good $150-200 with tax right there. I can&#x27;t imagine also getting a competitive CPU tossed in for that amount. Hell, my PC can&#x27;t play much at 1080p and the consoles pretty much play everything at 1080p.<p>Well that GPU is expensive because its not just a socketed GPU processor, its the ram, its the video bus, its a pci bus, its capacitors and voltage regulation, its the pcb, shroud, aluminum cooler, fan, etc. Just CPU fabs are pretty inexpensive compared to the complexity of a discrete GPU part. And $50 - $60 CPUs that blow the Jaguar cores in the xbone out of the water (Pentium G3258, Athlon 860k) are already available.<p>And a lot of console games this generation are not releasing at 1080p. Some are still upscaling 720 or 900 to 1080 because these consoles have modest performance specs. At release the 360 / ps3 had CPUs and GPUs competitive with some of the best in class hardware. When the Xbone and PS4 released they were already budget tier in both. And remember, console games are using lower resolution textures, lower view distances, lower poly count models, reduced or no AA, minimal particle effects, no fancy shadow effects, etc because one, you cannot really see the difference between medium tier and max tier graphics at ten feet away, and two, because these consoles are not capable of performing anywhere close to what discrete desktop class graphics cards dating back to 2010 could achieve.",1435687191

Compared to Scala and Haskell, Clojure is fast to learn. Java interop with Clojure is also really simple. I often use existing Java code by including it in my Clojure project and adding the magic Java build stuff to my project.clj file. Some purists might like to have just Clojure in their projects, but being able to pull in my old Java code (and other open source libraries) as needed is a large time saver.

But this muckraking j’accuse asserts that fluoride is indeed a dire threat to public health, one foisted upon the nation by a vast conspiracy—not of Communist agents, but of our very own military-industrial complex. Investigative reporter Bryson revisits the decades-long controversy, drawing on mountains of scientific studies, some unearthed from secret archives of government and corporate laboratories, to question the effects of fluoride and the motives of its leading advocates. The efficacy of fluoridated drinking water in preventing tooth decay, he contends, is dubious. Fluoride in its many forms may be one of the most toxic of industrial pollutants, and Bryson cites scientific analyses linking fluoridated drinking water to bone deformities, hyperactivity and a host of other complaints. The post-war campaign to fluoridate drinking water, he claims, was less a public health innovation than a public relations ploy sponsored by industrial users of fluoride—including the government’s nuclear weapons program. Legendary spin doctors like Edward Bernays exploited the tenuous link between dental hygiene and fluoridation to create markets to stimulate fluoride production and to prove the innocuousness of fluoride compounds, thereby heading off lawsuits by factory workers and others poisoned by industrial fluoride pollution. Bryson marshals an impressive amount of research to demonstrate fluoride’s harmfulness, the ties between leading fluoride researchers and the corporations who funded and benefited from their research, and what he says is the duplicity with which fluoridation was sold to the people. The result is a compelling challenge to the reigning dental orthodoxy, which should provoke renewed scientific scrutiny and public debate.&quot;",1435686876

9807125,comment,9801393,9805367,0,0,geofft,,,"I&#x27;m not sure if your question is based on an assumption about double-entry accounting. Bitcoin is <i>not</i> double-entry, at least in the sense that there aren&#x27;t two separate entries. A transaction transferring $50 from Alice to Bob is a single thing in the global ledger, signed by Alice&#x27;s key, transferring it to Bob. There&#x27;s no way to sever &quot;Alice spends $50&quot; from &quot;Bob receives $50&quot;, so even if you can cause transactions to be ignored, the whole thing, atomically, gets ignored. The transfer never happened, and no money is created or destroyed.<p>It is certainly possible for someone to modify a block and try to mine it. There&#x27;s no required consensus process in advance; you can just try to generate a block that has the data you want, and find a hash that starts with enough zeros. (You can&#x27;t alter a block so that money is spent without the consent of the money-holder, since each expenditure requires a digital signature. But if, say, Alice&#x27;s key has signed both &quot;Transfer this bitcoin to Bob&quot; and &quot;Transfer this bitcoin to Carol&quot;, you can mine either of those.)<p>The trouble with trying to do that is that mining is slow. The math problem is timed so that it takes roughly 10 minutes for <i>someone, somewhere</i> to successfully find an answer. So the CPU time is 10 minutes times the number of mining nodes on the Bitcoin network. If you, on your own computer, start trying to mine a block that&#x27;s different from what everyone else is trying to mine, you are going to have to be extraordinarily lucky to be able to get the math problem solved on your own within 10 minutes. The entire rest of the Bitcoin network is trying to mine a different block, and they&#x27;ll probably win.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you are extraordinarily lucky, or maybe you control like 30% of the network and you&#x27;re slightly lucky. What you&#x27;ve accomplished is to make a fork in the block chain: there are two blocks with the same parent. You can now send your fork to people, because there&#x27;s no way to to tell which one was &quot;real&quot; and which one wasn&#x27;t. But now you need to keep mining on your fork, because people will notice if the block chain mysteriously stops updating. You need to be incorporating everyone else&#x27;s transactions onto your fork. So not only do you need to be lucky, you need to be <i>repeatedly</i> lucky, all the time, so that your mining keeps up with the other fork. This is only feasible if you actually control 50% of the network.<p>But still, what have you accomplished? There&#x27;s no &quot;merge&quot; in Bitcoin. Everyone sees a single history. If they see two blockchains updating at the same speed, they know that something is up and it can be resolved by humans; no program is going to simultaneously trust both histories. So either Alice transferred a bitcoin to Bob (and thus not to Carol), as she authorized, or she transferred a bitcoin to Carol (and therefore not to Bob), as she authorized, or the bitcoin remains with Alice and no transaction happened. The best you can do is prevent people from spending their money, if you reliably control 50% or more of the network. You can&#x27;t cause money to be double-spent.<p>And yes, it is common to wait 10 minutes or often 60 minutes to wait out an attacker&#x27;s luck, at least for large transactions. The official Bitcoin client calls transactions &quot;unconfirmed&quot; until it sees six blocks mined on top, at which point it&#x27;s assumed infeasible for you to have a separate history from the rest of the network. For smaller transactions, people tend not to wait as long. But the same thing happens with conventional currency. Most stores don&#x27;t check small bills with counterfeit pens. Most credit card readers support offline transactions, but you get the product immediately. Personal checks can take up to a month to clear or bounce. If there&#x27;s something high-value, you get a cashier&#x27;s check or you run a credit report on the person. Otherwise you trade off the risk for convenience.<p>See the Bitcoin wiki article on confirmation for a bit more discussion about how long to wait vs. how strong an attacker is: <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confirmation</a><p>Let me know if I understood you correctly and whether that was answering the question you asked.",1435686653

The rest of the expense of production comes from amortizing the cost of design and plant setup...the majority of which is caused by the need for so many variants for the consumer segment.<p>So if Microsoft dumped the consumer-focused CPU and GPU segments, they could <i>drastically</i> reduce the design and plant setup costs of production, probably by an order of magnitude or more. All they would need is their existing XBox chips, and a handful a handful of heavyweight server chips. With much lower design and plant setup costs, combined with extremely high volume production, it isn&#x27;t hard to believe they can drive down the total cost per chip to $10-$20.<p>And at those price levels, they could likely undercut the PS4 as well as all the other cloud vendors in their respective segments.",1435686329

It does not dispute that fluoride in toothpaste reduces tooth decay.<p>> Studies that attest to the effectiveness of fluoridation were generally done before the widespread usage of fluoride-containing dental products like rinses and toothpastes in the 1970s and later, according to the recent Cochrane study. So while it may have once made sense to add fluoride to water, it no longer appears to be necessary or useful, Thiessen says.<p>> It has also become clear in the last 15 years that fluoride primarily acts topically, according to the CDC. It reacts with the surface of the tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acids excreted by bacteria. Thus, there&#x27;s no good reason to swallow fluoride and subject every tissue of your body to it, Thiessen says.<p>> Another 2009 review by the Cochrane group clearly shows that fluoride toothpaste prevents cavities.",1435686321

There are a handful of languages that don&#x27;t permit that, such as Erlang, and some languages like Haskell that permit you to use &quot;tying the knot&quot; to create cyclic structures [1], but ones that can sometimes be difficult to manipulate after the fact.<p>In those languages, you&#x27;ll probably need to use a data structure well known for its simplicity, efficiency, and broad cross-language-platform compatibility: The Resource Description Framework&#x27;s graph model. Graphs are also a well-known candidate for &quot;universal data structure&quot; [2]. Also, it&#x27;s semantic, which is a <i>clear</i> advantage over the entirely not semantic UniversalHash, because semantic is better than not semantic when it comes to universal semantics of semanticness.<p>Semantic.<p>Otherwise, the article is pretty solid and all serious developers should definitely consider implementing it forthwith, as they will find it a very, very educational experience. I know I&#x27;ve seen people implement this model in Java before, and I can certainly vouch for the fact that it was an education for all involved.<p>I&#x27;m going to say &quot;semantic&quot; one more time, because it&#x27;s been my observation that the more you say it, the smarter you sound, so: semantic. Oh, yeah, that&#x27;s the stuff. Mmmmmmmmm.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot</a><p>[2]: Seriously, if you really do want to discuss the &quot;universal data structure&quot;, perhaps because you want to analyze data structures very generically for some mathematical reason, graphs really are a good candidate. Not necessarily RDF graphs, which are both bizarrely complicated while lacking simple features; the three blessed collection types are a weird combination of features.",1435684827

9806755,comment,9805520,9805950,0,0,puredanger,,,"Much Clojure code relies on applying nested transformations to sequences:<p><pre><code>    (reduce + 0 (filter odd? (map inc (range 1000))))\n</code></pre>\nConceptually, this takes an input sequence of 1000 elements (range 100), then creates an intermediate sequence of (map inc), then creates an intermediate sequence of (filter odd?), then reduces that with +. (I am glossing over a number of internal optimizations - chunking and transients, but the idea holds.)<p>Transducers let you represent the transformation parts as an independent (reusable) thing:<p><pre><code>    (def xf (comp (map inc) (filter odd?)))\n</code></pre>\nYou then apply that composite transformation in a single pass over the input:<p><pre><code>    (transduce xf + 0 (range 1000))\n</code></pre>\ntransduce combines (a) input iteration (b) transformation application and (c) what to do with the results - in this case apply + as a reduce. Other functions also exist that make different choices about how to combine these parts: into collects results into a collection, sequence can incrementally produce a result, eduction can delay execution, core.async chans can apply them in a queue-like way.<p>There are a number of benefits here:<p>1. Composability - transformations are isolated from their input and output contexts and thus reusable in many contexts.<p>2. Performance - the sequence example above allocates two large intermediate sequences. The transduce version does no intermediate allocation. Additionally, some collection inputs are &quot;internally reducible&quot; (including range in 1.7) which allows them to be traversed more quickly via reduce/transduce contexts. The performance benefits of these changes can be dramatic as you increase the size of input data or number of transformations. If you happen to have your data in an input collection (like a vector), into with transducers can be used to move data directly from one vector to another without ever producing a sequence.<p>3. Eagerness - if you know you will process the entire input into the entire output, you can do so eagerly and avoid overhead. Or you can get laziness via sequence (although there are some differences in what that means with transducers). The upshot is you now have more choices.<p>4. Resource management - because you have the ability to eagerly process an external input source, you have more knowledge about when it&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; so you can release the resource.",1435683801

For example, I work a lot with Rails apps, and sometimes we&#x27;ll need a dev to come in and work some css/html magic or something like that. Well getting them setup with rvm, ruby, rails, bundler, mysql, elasticsearch and working through compilation errors on OSX can be a real nightmare, especially if you set up your env 2 years ago and have just been updating it incrementally since.<p>When we dockerize the app, they can be setup with the docker image and ready to go in under an hour, without having to screw with their system ... much.",1435683784

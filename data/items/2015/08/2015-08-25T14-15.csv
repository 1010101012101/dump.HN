Research does not get funded unless there is a commercial market for the drug. This leads to overfunding of maintenance treatments of chronic diseases like diabetes, because they are widespread and never really go away. Meanwhile, the system does not incentivize investment in things like antibiotics (because the next wide-spectrum antibiotic that gets developed will likely be force-licensed for public health interests).<p>2. For the vast majority of life-threatening diseases that anyone is likely to catch, the most effective drugs are already off-patent. Unless you can significantly improve outcomes, how can you compete with a generic that works 95% as well as your new drug?<p>3. The only country currently willing to pay sticker price for pharmaceuticals is the US. Every other country negotiates prices down to a fraction of what the US pays. The idea of a month worth of pills costing $400 is unheard of outside the US. So US citizens are either directly subsidizing the cheap drugs for the rest of the world, or we&#x27;re getting taken for a ride.<p>4. The majority of the cost of developing a drug comes in the clinical trial phases. This cost is the same for any drug -- and most of this is marketing budget. Studies are designed to have specific outcomes so they can be listed as bullet points on information sheets given to doctors -- doctors are smart, but they&#x27;re busy, so if you can do a study saying that &quot;outcomes in high-risk patients were improved by 30% over the leading treatment&quot;, the doctors will never look to see what high-risk patients means, whether the study was done correctly, or even what an improved outcome looks like for those patients. Never mind you may have done the study 8 times and this outcome was only observed once.<p>Pharma is broken. Our current pharma industry is geared towards &quot;lifecycle&quot; drugs that alleviate symptoms rather than fixing any underlying problems.",1440514798

I&#x27;m going to watch their memory talk today (when I can get a free 90 minutes).<p>[edit]<p>Reading the Memory page on the wiki, it is indeed SAS with an MPU.  Obvious difference from Blackfin is that you have 2^28 times as many addresses available.<p>It would also be interesting to see how much smaller a PLB entry is compared to a typical TLB.  TLB misses are responsible for a surprising amount of performance loss on some workloads as L2 caches have gotten so much larger, so if they can have e.g. an order of magnitude more entries in the PLB it would be a big performance win.<p>[edit3] It just occurred to me that your PLBs could be as slow as your L1 cache with little impact on performance.  This can also let them be physically larger than your TLBs.<p>Assuming the ISA is designed for efficient PIC/PID a unix-like shouldn&#x27;t be <i>too</i> terrible to port from that difference alone.  I know there have been SAS unixes before.<p>I have run into the 46-bit userspace limit on linux AMD64 (think mmap), so I&#x27;m somewhat concerned 64-bits may not be enough in the future as disks get bigger, though that&#x27;s a <i>long</i> way off as you have 2^14 times that room under this scheme.<p>[edit2] It&#x27;s a 60-bit SAS, not a 64-bit SAS",1440514731

We carry cell phones which are fountains of data regarding our communications and movement, and we use the internet, which is a very large window into the content and often intent of our minds, not to mention ANOTHER fountain of information about our location and communications. On top of that, there are probably more CCTV cameras, dashcams, airborne cameras (with ARGOS), and body cameras today. Hell, they even have microphones and cameras in public buses / bus stops / metro trains.<p>These cameras are all infinitely more utile than in 1984 once they are linked to facial recognition and gait recognition technology. In 1984, you could be an unnoticed face in a crowd if you weren&#x27;t under investigation-- not so in our reality. You step outside, and the fact that you did so is tied to your identity and dossier and noted for later.<p>Like I said before, Ingsoc of 1984 was a primitive surveillance society which still relied on humans to manually collect data on each other&#x27;s conversations and movement patterns. It just doesn&#x27;t scale as cleanly as an automatic computer system does. There wasn&#x27;t any ability to create dossiers on 100% of people passively, nor was there any ability to sort people based off of various patterns, nor was there any ability to build sentiment maps, etc.<p>As far as exploitation goes, I&#x27;m not going to say that our society is blatantly coercive using surveillance in the way that Ingsoc was. Wild abuses of the surveillance apparatus is utterly undeniable, however. Consider that whistleblower Russ Tice has said that Obama was being surveilled before his presidential term. Consider the terms &quot;LOVEINT/SEXINT&quot; and the JTRIG group. These are serious, democracy-eradicating abuses whose purpose is blackmail, not finding terrorists. I will also say that the current trend of politicians trying to outlaw cryptography and the sentiment there there should be nothing beyond the government&#x27;s reach is taking us even further into totalitarian territory.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole &quot;we never voted or asked for this and now it won&#x27;t go away&quot; thing.

I would like to point out that babies being born with no legs (generally with appendages missing) is in fact known to be one of the great screwups of pharmacology (though anyone reporting it today would undoubtedly hold the pharma industry responsible. In my opinion that is not a reasonable position to take. It was almost unheard of to do separate pregnancy testing (it&#x27;s still not common at all), therefore blaming someone for not doing them is not fair).<p>It is even a truism to say that medicine for pregnant women (when not relating to the pregnancy itself) is far behind &quot;normal&quot; medicine, as for most treatments it is not known what effect they&#x27;ll have on the embryo, or if there will be interactions between the pregnancy and the treatment. Of course there is also a number of treatments that can&#x27;t be used because they&#x27;re known to be harmful, but not nearly as many. This crisis is one of the main reasons for this.<p>But what caused babies with no legs: The softenon/thalomide disaster.<p>Here&#x27;s the full story: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#Birth_defects_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#Birth_defects_cris...</a> More photos illustrating exactly what went wrong can be found here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocomelia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocomelia</a><p>The scary part is that it was a problem relating to the chirality of the molecule used. Very few chemical tests of the molecule would have even revealed that there were two kinds of the molecule, and there was no good reason to assume one would cause deformed babies. In other words: this was extremely likely (and sadly) an honest mistake. 20000 deformed babies were born, about half survived (I went to school with a very cute and smart one). One enantiomer causes babies with missing appendages, one does not. Both help against a number of cancers, various serious diseases and there is some use as a sedative and it helps against morning sickness during pregnancy.<p>Getting the chirality right is bloody hard, even for people with advanced chemistry degrees (especially getting to the required purity).<p>This disaster is also well known for being one of the main reasons our current pharma regime is what it is.",1440513268

But they&#x27;re designed to inflate in the time it takes a typical person to impact the airbag. Basically all you need to do is sit back in your seat and in a comfortable position and you should be okay.<p>Every now and then you see nervous drivers sitting forwards in their seat with their face near the wheel. It&#x27;s scary to think what would happen if the airbag were to deploy. Just don&#x27;t be that person.<p>Also, be careful sitting too far away that you&#x27;re not locking your elbows. You might cause serious injury to your arms in even a minor crash.",1440511368

I'm not a lawyer, so not 100% on any this but it seems fairly clear.  I'm sure YC has real lawyers who will work out any details.  This is just mostly to put my own mind at ease about trouble getting in.  And it looks like it won't be much trouble at all.",1173991809

They can be right anal if they think you're actually do anything productive.  Could've just been the fine folk in Montana. Tight squinting eyes boring through your soul.  Fingers rapping gently over the grip of their pistol.  Waiting and watching you as a stillness fills the air, offering you no escape.  ""You boys ain't look'n at taki'n jobs from good 'merican boys now are ya?""  <p>As someone mentioned, you can 'visit' but I'm not sure how well that'd work overall.  Boston is a 5 hour drive from Montreal.  If I recall correctly YC has funded outsiders before.  I would be very interested to hear how they managed.<p>I think Y Combinator would be an amazing experience that I wouldn't get anywhere else.  I'd be more than willing to give up several months of my life to move to a new country to learn and work with amazing people.  The question of the border is the biggest stumbling block in the path.\n",1173989856

Perhaps, even, it may prompt you to reconsider if starting a company at this point is right for you. Pursuing a startup requires an extraordinary amount of dedication and focus; the issues presented are not indicative of that.",1173988910

That means you raped me yesterday!&quot;<p>Er, no.<p>Either you consent to have sexual relations with someone, or you don&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t, that should always be respected entirely. If you withdraw your consent halfway through sex, that should also be respected entirely. However, you can&#x27;t withdraw consent later when you find out that the other person wasn&#x27;t using protection. Or rather, you can accuse them of being an asshole, but you can&#x27;t accuse them of raping you.",1404485958
7988986,comment,7988658,7988930,2,0,deong,,,"I can only guess, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a combination of factors.<p>First, the JIT on my quad-core i7 can be pretty intense. I&#x27;m more willing to pay the overhead than I am on a device that has a tiny battery and gets hot in my pocket. So the JIT on my desktop is going to be better than the one on my phone.<p>Second, Java is mostly a server language these days. The types of programs that run on servers are going to be more amenable to profile-guided optimizations than UI heavy event handling code that constitutes a large part of phone apps.<p>And on desktops and servers, it just doesn&#x27;t matter that much. Particularly on a server, startup time is pretty much irrelevant. So the downsides to JITs are minimized due to the nature of the workload.",1404485944

Honestly, I built Invoiced because a lot of people using this invoicing website I made [1] kept asking for more features and offering to pay for them. Initially I was hesitant about building a product that already had competitors. Fortunately the target market is huge because we solve problems faced by most businesses. Many of our competitors have built full-stack accounting platforms whereas Invoiced focuses on building and maintaining your revenue stream.<p>I might take a break at some point to blog about my experience.

7988981,comment,7986612,7986736,1,0,tete,,,"More toolsets seems like the wrong way to me. The reason is that browsers barely even keep up with the current ones or even old ones.<p>Also browsers work because of standards. It&#x27;s not about the &quot;best&quot;, but about agreeing.<p>Recently I see many people trying to make one suboptimal thing by starting from scratch, removing all standards compatibility, throwing away all the knowledge that went in to a thing to make this one single thing work better, resulting only in incompatibilities, non-standards-conformance and making everything else than that one thing harder or even impossible.<p>You can see this with web frameworks, with system tools, etc.<p>Usually this stems from people knowing how to use stuff, but not understanding concepts or why things are the way they are.<p>This is actually also true for CSS. CSS was meant to support all kinds of output devices, regardless of being graphical or not, support screens in all sizes and nowadays people use it to only really support a low number of &quot;pixelperfect&quot; screen sizes with default settings. Everything else is completely broken.<p>Nobody even bothers to look at new CSS3 features, new HTML 5 elements (unless it is for SEO), etc. In the end nobody is interested in implementing it correctly which usually results in standards to only slowly advance and having individual vendors only implementing their favorites or even their proposals and experiments, rendering the standard itself unusable, because of it being implemented by one single vendor.<p>In the end we live in a world where the only thing that&#x27;s really common inside the infrastructure are hacks to work around those problems.<p>Most developers hoped this would change after Firefox ate a big part of IEs market share, but currently it seems to be repeating.<p>Btw. I am not excluding myself from these things. I don&#x27;t actively work into other directions and basically do the same things.<p>Before you disagree: If you have something about CSS in your resume. Did you ever even completely read through CSS standards?",1404485909

The only reason Assange was charged in the first place was political pressure from the United States, which would provide the opportunity for an extradition (on some suitable pretext) even in the absence of a conviction.<p>This is a textbook example of a large, public extrajudicial process. The political situation will not change even if this case falls apart - so Assange would still be a refugee or a fugitive, depending on who you ask. British authorities would certainly find some pretext to arrest him and extradite him even if the Swedish government publicly verifies his safety and innocence.<p>I would love to be proved wrong if someone is better informed about this than I, but this just seems completely obvious.",1404482475

Unlike Codecanyon, which someone else mentioned in this thread, our focus is on professional development and components that are more than simple scripts. Cocoacontrols (<a href=""https://www.cocoacontrols.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cocoacontrols.com/</a>) is another good example, with some of their commercial components doing very well.<p>We have several developers making SV comparable salaries from publishing on our platform (in the 100k$ range annually). I believe this can be a huge market - if you look at companies selling licenses to code or SDK binaries, there&#x27;s quite a few who built very profitable businesses around it.<p>Very well known examples of companies selling code licenses include MySQL and Magento (through their enterprise versions), though they provide complete solutions and not components. Gravity Forms (<a href=""http://www.gravityforms.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gravityforms.com/</a>) a wordpress plug-in, is another good example - it generated millions in revenue if you trust their installation counter.",1382198398

California and Texas picked up a lot of the marijuana routes when the center of gravity shifted from Colombian to Mexican cartels. But boat traffic from Haiti and other parts of the area is a huge cocaine route.<p>Anecdotally speaking: back when I worked in the entertainment business, I&#x27;d fly out to Miami for a lot of annual conferences. Maybe it&#x27;s just the nature of that crowd, but man, they basically dusted the streets in coke. I could almost swear I got some as part of my check-in basket at the Fontainebleau.<p>I thought cocaine was everywhere in LA -- but in Miami I&#x27;m pretty sure you can buy it over the counter at a McDonald&#x27;s, and no one would bat an eyelash.",1382198381

6576812,comment,6575561,6575892,1,0,mitmatt,,,"Just speaking in terms of &quot;quantum size&quot; (and not computing power, which is not understood yet), it depends on the graph of possible entanglements among the qubits. If it were a complete graph (allowing arbitrary entanglement) then the size of the relevant Hilbert space would exactly double with each additional qubit (i.e. one would need twice as many complex numbers to describe any particular wave function in the space). But the D-Wave chips operate with a fixed topology that (I think) is far from fully-connected (e.g. the 128-bit chip used a &quot;Chimera graph&quot;, which they describe in blog posts and publications). The growth would only be truly exponential with sufficient connectivity (e.g. a planar graph would mean sub-exponential growth).",1382198269

There is an absolute myth in industry that if someone who has a PhD shows interest, then you&#x27;re best looking elsewhere, because they&#x27;re likely to not find the work challenging enough and jump ship easily as a result.<p>I&#x27;m on the verge of completing my PhD thesis, so I can easily relate to what you&#x27;re saying. I&#x27;ve pretty much perfected the art of starting with &quot;I&#x27;m getting my PhD, but don&#x27;t assume that I&#x27;m not interested in more &quot;mundane&quot; things&quot;. Pretty much, I think there&#x27;s a challenge to be had in any tech job, and I think the main characteristics to convey to a possible future employer is that beyond having a great tech skill set, you know how to manage a project (HUGE skill I&#x27;ve gained from managing my PhD), you know how to perservere in the face of adversity (any PhD candidate that hasn&#x27;t faced this hasn&#x27;t done their PhD the &quot;right&quot; way in my opinion), and you&#x27;re creative right down to your core.",1382198235

6576808,comment,6576253,6576664,5,0,mcphilip,,,"I work in risk analytics and think this comment is dead on.  Tools such as Splunk can wrap metadata facilitating analysis around arbitrary input data (e.g. admin logs, vulnerability scan results, etc).  I expect that such tools will reduce the need for some of the work currently done by data scientists.<p>With that said, there is still a need for human driven analysis of risk data in order to compose models that prioritize and collate incoming signals in ways to assist in risk management decisions.  These models are highly domain specific (e.g. a model for evaluating IT infrastructure assets&#x27; risk across a global banking business) and are nontrivial to design.<p>I suspect that data scientists will be useful in bridging the gap between automated risk analytics collection tools and corporate risk management by assisting in coming up with risk models based on the volumes of incoming data.<p>Edit: or maybe &quot;quants&quot;, not &quot;data scientists&quot; will fill this role.

The only problem was that the PC BIOS and DOS didn&#x27;t support the second side.<p>So I bought a PC with no floppy drives and picked up a couple of double sided drives at a local distributor for $300 each.<p>As I&#x27;d hoped, they worked fine as single sided drives too, so I was able to boot DOS. Then I got to work on supporting the other side.<p>It seemed a bit complicated to try to merge the two sides into a single FAT filesystem, so I wrote a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident program) that mapped the other two sides onto additional drive letters.<p>That turned out to be surprisingly easy. So the four sides on my two floppy drives were A:, B:, C:, and D: drives.<p>Later I got an awesome Tallgrass 10MB hard drive for only $5000, and that became my E: drive.<p>Now I knew my storage problems were over: I would never run out of space with that thing!",1382198106

Sometimes you just have to roll your own.<p>With a complex ecommerce build you can run into situations where something has gone badly wrong with the pricing, e.g. everything is marked up as on sale, price 0.00. With a roll your own solution you can build an XML tree of the document, go through your HTML tags and put in some rules to make sure that all the prices are greater than zero (for instance).<p>As for keywords, you want something on the page in the footer, however, that can change.

6576633,comment,6574087,6575766,1,0,paulasmuth,,,"We will open source our CF-based recommendation engine in the next days. We use the code in production (on a site with a few hundred million views a month) with up to 80GB datasets for item<->item CF. The engine generates thousands of recommendations per second per core. HTTP round-trip-time to fetch a recommendation from localhost is well below one millisecond.<p>I don&#x27;t have the full engine source code or benchmarks to share right now (hopefully in the next two weeks as it is approved by our legal department), but I can tell you all the hard lifting is done by a library called &quot;libsmatrix&quot;, which implements a fast, memory-efficient sparse matrix data structure that is used at the core of the CF algo. libsmatrix is 100% threadsafe and persists to disk (this way you can also work with datasets larger than the available main memory). this library is already open sourced:<p><pre><code>    https://github.com/paulasmuth/libsmatrix\n</code></pre>\nUsing libsmatrix, you can build the rest of the &quot;engine&quot; in a matter of a hundred lines of C or so...<p><pre><code>    #include &quot;smatrix.h&quot;\n    smatrix_t* my_smatrix;\n\n    // libsmatrix example: simple CF based recommendation engine\n    int main(int argc, char **argv) {\n      my_smatrix = smatrix_open(NULL);\n\n      // one preference set = list of items in one session\n      // e.g. list of viewed items by the same user\n      // e.g. list of bought items in the same checkout\n      uint32_t input_ids[5] = {12,52,63,76,43};\n      import_preference_set(input_ids, 5);\n\n      // generate recommendations (similar items) for item #76\n      void neighbors_for_item(76);\n\n      smatrix_close(my_smatrix);\n      return 0;\n    }\n\n    // train / add a preference set (list of items in one session)\n    void import_preference_set(uint32_t* ids, uint32_t num_ids) {\n      uint32_t i, n;\n\n      for (n = 0; n < num_ids; n++) {\n        smatrix_incr(my_smatrix, ids[n], 0, 1);\n\n        for (i = 0; i < pset->len; i++) {\n          if (i != n) {\n            smatrix_incr(my_smatrix, ids[n], ids[i], 1);\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // get recommendations for item with id &quot;item_id&quot;\n    void neighbors_for_item(uint32_t item_id)\n      uint32_t neighbors, *row, total;\n\n      total = smatrix_get(my_smatrix, item_id, 0);\n      neighbors = smatrix_getrow(my_smatrix, item_id, row, 8192);\n\n      for (pos = 0; pos < neighbors; pos++) {\n        uint32_t cur_id = row[pos * 2];\n\n        printf(&quot;found neighbor for item %u: item %u with distance %f\n&quot;,\n          item_id, cf_cosine(smatrix, cur_id, row[pos * 2 + 1], total));\n      }\n\n      free(row);\n    }\n\n    // calculates the cosine vector distance between two items\n    double cf_cosine(smatrix_t* smatrix, uint32_t b_id, uint32_t cc_count, uint32_t a_total) {\n      uint32_t b_total;\n      double num, den;\n\n      b_total = smatrix_get(smatrix, b_id, 0);\n\n      if (b_total == 0)\n        b_total = 1;\n\n      num = cc_count;\n      den = sqrt((double) a_total) * sqrt((double) b_total);\n\n      if (den == 0.0)\n        return 0.0;\n\n      if (num > den)\n        return 0.0;\n\n      return (num / den);\n    }</code></pre>",1382195226

Having been all over the country, FL has its pros and cons like anyplace else.<p>FL is not that cheap anymore. Car insurance and home insurance are a fortune, some of the highest in the country. You also have to drive everywhere. Traffic in Miami is downright brutal both weekday and weekend. Plus, you have a lot of immigrants that do not know how to drive. If you like to ride motorcycles, dont.<p>The work ethic in Florida is probably one of the worst in the country. In NY and Cali it would take about 10-15 interviews to find a relatively qualified candidate. In FL it is roughly 1:25-30 candidates. Mostly because of DUI felonies or drug test failures.<p>Miami is the gateway to South America and other 3rd world countries so if you do not like Spanish culture don&#x27;t bother. As a white person, you are a minority in South FL. Crime in Miami is some of the highest in the country and having a CCW permit is the norm, not the exception. FL is still very much the wild wild west.<p>South FL has a great scene for artists, graphic designers and retailers but still have a very hard time attracting exceptional programmers due to the hot weather and low salaries. If you have children do not bother with the public schools, you will have to go private.<p>FL is a great place for a startup due to the lack of taxes and cheap labor available. However, if you are not a principal of the company go elsewhere.<p>Also, if you are dealing with a person or company and do not put anything in writing...RUN. In NY and CA people are very upfront and comfortable with contracts. Not so in FL. If you say the word contract they look at you like you offended them. FL has the Homestead Act and because of that you get a lot of the felons and riff raff who move to FL to start again and pump the money into their homes. Very shady environment.<p>Talent sticks with other talent and success leaves footprints.<p>There are a lot of other great places to work, live and build a business.",1382195220

Not to say that you&#x27;re wrong, because I have never sold a gig in London, but I have heard the same about geographies/specialities with which I&#x27;m intimately familiar, and usually the claim comes from someone who has sort of fallen into a particular style of customer/acquisition channel/work and is not aware that large parts of the market exist in such a way that they&#x27;d never hear of them.<p>For example, rather frequently on HN we&#x27;ll have people quote the going rate on Craiglist or RentACodeMonkey.com quoted as the maximum available for (without loss of generality) Rails programmers in Chicago, despite it being at an 80%+ discount to rates routinely charged by people whose clients wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead on Craigslist.",1382195212

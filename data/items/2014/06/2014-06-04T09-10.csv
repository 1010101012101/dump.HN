7844787,comment,7844298,7844298,4,0,jacquesm,,,"These are the hardest. See, when a company or project is dead on arrival there is not much to do, you bury it, do a post-mortem and move on.<p>If a company is successful then you ride the wave as far and as long as your stamina will let you and then you hopefully pocket a nice chunk of cash.<p>But when you&#x27;re in the middle, too big to die, too small to succeed it gets very hard. Killing it off feels completely wrong, pushing it feels like you are adding to the opportunity cost with a relatively small chance chance of eventual success. It&#x27;s a very practical illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy in all its gruesome glory.<p>Personally I hope that gittip will continue to grow and that the team will stick with it. They serve a very important role, pioneers in uncharted territory. And even if a lot of those pioneers ended up dead in creeks with arrows in their backs they pointed the way, showed what works and what does not. And they still have a sufficiently large shot at success if they stick with it. But if they&#x27;d pull the plug I would not fault them.<p>Let&#x27;s hope there will be a 3rd instalment of this article, where gittip grew steadily for the 3rd year in a row and it became profitable. That would be the best way to see this go.",1401875921

CRIME is a side channel attack, but the side channel that leaks information (compressed cleartext size) is not related to the language used, but again to the design of the algorithm.<p>The basic idea is that implementation-related side-channel attacks, such as timing and power draw, are very hard to exploit remotely. I guess you could write a JavaScript implementation of AES that is so bad that key-dependent multimillisecond jitter can be measured remotely. But it&#x27;s almost impossible to do it by mistake.<p>The real problems of JavaScript are it&#x27;s highly malleable runtime that offers no guarantees, everything is writable.

I&#x27;m currently in Romania, and even though I manage to stay afloat here quite nicely I&#x27;d hate to have a family here with kids growing up in this environment. Poland is doing ok and improving steadily, the Czech republic is also quite manageable. But compared to say France, Belgium, the UK, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands there is still a significant difference.<p>Romania:<p>For instance, infrastructure here is lacking (but internet is quite good), roads are bad, traffic is insanely dangerous, I&#x27;m positively terrified of getting into a road accident here. Medical services exist but it&#x27;s cash up-front or you&#x27;re in trouble. Older folks are living terrible lives (little or no social net, so tons of beggars on the streets). I would never want to live here with a family, and friends of mine that emigrated here with their kids from Canada have already packed up and left again, their explicitly stated reason is they don&#x27;t want their children to grow up here. Romania is a beautiful country, it has <i>tons</i> of potential, I know a large number of really nice people here but there is much work to be done and a long way to go to put an end to all the corruption, to fix the terrible state things are in and to get good healthcare.<p>Poland:<p>Poland has done very well, in the last two decades the changes have been enormous. Proximity to Germany has definitely helped the Poles, America has also invested quite a bit of money there. And of course they have helped themselves, they collectively worked very hard to get out of the rut they were in at the end of the 80&#x27;s. Infrastructure is improving, every time I visit I see new stretches of highway that come online, cities are slowly being cleaned up, there is more or less continuous progress. Healthcare is not super good but it will do. Raising children in Poland would definitely be a possibility.<p>Czech Republic:<p>My knowledge about the Czech republic is thin and mostly second hand, but I know two couples that were mixed nationalities that lived there, both have now moved to different countries in western europe (France and NL respectively). In one of those cases the parents explicitly stated they did not want to live in the Czech republic with children for a number of reasons, all of which sounded plausible to me. (Most prominent: not to limit the future chances of the children).<p>I have no experience with Latvia and Estonia so can&#x27;t comment on those.<p>So I don&#x27;t know how much direct experience you have with any of these countries but I would definitely hesitate to bring my children here, I would feel I&#x27;m doing them a serious dis-service.",1401873881

Also for selecting them, copying and pasting, indenting, surrounding and so on, all in 2 to 3 keystrokes. Another example is the multilevel, tree-like, infinite undo of both editors. And many more: mark ring, multilevel &quot;clipboard&quot;, registers, very easy to access macros, narrow to region (this one <i>could</i> be Emacs specific, but I doubt there&#x27;s no Vim plugin for this), search (both literal and regex) and replace (both literal and with <i>expression</i>, incredibly powerful) and so on and on, and that&#x27;s just built-in purely editing features, not going into integration with other tools or plugins.<p>I would have migrated to LightTable long ago if it provided at least some of a more advanced, but purely editing oriented features. It doesn&#x27;t yet, and it will take it long years to get there because of sheer size of a required featureset. And that&#x27;s still not counting my 3k lines of personal Elisp and some 20k lines of Elisp in installed plugins.<p>I&#x27;m going to give Leo a try, but even if it really is as good as it&#x27;s web page says I can&#x27;t see myself migrating to it in the near future. I may use it from time to time for specific tasks, but my daily editing will be done in Emacs; in the worst case I will have to copy&paste bits of text between Emacs and Leo windows if Leo&#x27;s editing model/core editing functionality sucks enough (I did this with some other editors and I despite copy&paste overhead I was still faster than I&#x27;d be staying in the single editor).",1401873681

I&#x27;m currently looking for opportunities outside of my resident city where my various skills can be fully utilized to their greatest potential in service of a product that I love.<p>From the very beginning of my career at EditGrid.com (acquired by Apple in 2008) to my most recent job with Muneris Services (funded by Intel), I have had a tremendous fortune to be working from the front-end all the way to the back-end on every subsequent job that I took on. In the past 10 years, I had emerged from being a beginning Java programmer to being a very proficient polyglot software engineer well versed in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python and Scala, in additional to a number of other static and dynamically typed languages and software technologies. I firmly believe that my skills will be of tremendous value to my future employer.<p>In my free time, I&#x27;m also an active open source developer within the Javascript and Python communities. My most recent success is Backgrid.js, which within 2 days from announcement on Reddit, it had been submitted to Jeremy Ashkenas (creator of Cofferscript, Backbone.js and Underscore.js) himself to HackerNews and stayed on the front page for 2 days.<p>I have grown enormously by working with many talented and inspiring individuals in the past. I firmly believe that the key to personal and organizational success is a culture of continuous learning and practice, and a culture of passionate dedication and respect. I am looking forward to working for a company that aspire to these ideals in my next venture.",1401872867
7844665,comment,7843664,7844630,2,0,nilium,,,"> Scala has slightly more overhead though from making lots of small objects<p>This is definitely true, though it&#x27;s possible to write code that avoids it. It just ends up being slightly uglier Scala. The renderer in Ascension, for example, is all fairly bare-bones Java-like Scala because I have to be careful about how certain code is generated (i.e., prefer a while loop or tail recursion to a for comprehension or .foreach). So, it&#x27;s possible to get performant code, it just ends up being more like Java usually.<p>In the UI code, you can get away with a little more depending on where it is. If it&#x27;s inside an adapter, it pays to avoid the heavier tools Scala gives you. If it&#x27;s responding to a button press, you probably don&#x27;t need to worry as much. The GC will run a little more often, but the GC in Android has improved a fair bit over time.<p>I&#x27;ll second the Java collections recommendation though — as much as I like the immutable collections provided by Scala (and I do use a few of them), they&#x27;re much free-er with their allocations than Java and Android&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t tried anything with actors on Android yet, though, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I just use AsyncTask as carefully as possible right now, but I really need to get familiar with an alternative to that. I&#x27;d like to try actors, plus I&#x27;d also like to get into using something like RxJava/Scala, but I haven&#x27;t had anything come up where I could afford to experiment with it. Also need to see how Akka fares on Android, but same problem as RxJ/S.",1401872850

At some point I said, no, no more.&quot;<p>> In an interview I said exactly that, that I didn’t use it just because it wouldn’t stay still for two days in a row.

146203,comment,141898,141898,0,0,jbrinnand,,,"Thanks for the article. It bears out the experiences I have had working for small and large companies. Engineers in startups are closer to the business and (sometimes) to the customer. They are solving real problems and inventing new things. Though it can be stressful, it also gives you a sense of worth. The other thing is does is allow you to ""play"" in the sense of being creating - making new things and having fun doing it.<p>Large companies tend to be political. Folks want position,  title, etc. As one person put it - ""I handle 250 off-shore engineers"". My instant reaction was ""but what have you, personally, built today.""<p>There is the notion that hierarchies are good. That as you move away from coding you are ""rising"" in the hierarchy. This substitution of image for ability while gratifying to the ego, kills creativity and promotes mediocrity.<p>As you state, and experience bears it out: software works best with core (small) teams with creative innovate people working for a common goal.",1206482265
146202,comment,146019,146085,0,0,notauser,,,"I wonder which is really harder, becoming a good enough coder, or becoming a good enough $specialty.<p>Computers are, lets face it, logical things. How much programming skill do you _really_ need to build a prototype? The ability to logically think through a problem, the ability to decompose it into small enough chunks, and then to make those chunks work. Sure, it won't be pretty or elegant or scale if you suck at data structures and algorithms, but it doesn't _need_ to be pretty and elegant to get through the prototype stage. Heck some major sites are ugly, inelegant, and scale like a man climbing a wet glass wall.<p>Fortunately computers are viewed as 'super hard' (genuine quote) by the general population... for now. If that changes, by virtue of people being introduced to start-simple-get-complex coding (eg excel macros, flash) or easier creation tools being developed, geeks who bang out simple web apps could be much less competitive as startup founders.<p>That's not to say they won't be valued - someone will need to clean up the huge pile of steaming junk thrown out by Dreamweaver 6. And there will still be genuinely hard problems to solve... which is one reason why I'm basing my startup on a problem set that requires efficient graph coloring and traversal :)",1206482116

I learned how to write clearly for an audience which doesn't have all of the domain knowledge I have accumulated. And I learned that sometimes it's much better to say ""hey!

They don't dress and otherwise present themselves professionally.  They fail to interface professionally with customers and analysts as a doctor or lawyer would.  Programmers themselves tend to demand a management style that treats them as a cog in the machine, where they are fed detailed requirements and produce output for others to deal with.<p>The nature of programming work is not so far removed from what a corporate lawyer or financial analyst does.  Yet programmers have a much different public image.  I think it's fair to say programming attracts certain idiosyncratic personalities that affect the general perception of the work.<p>On the same theme as the grandparent post, don't undervalue the soft touch.

You won't stay in business long if you get a reputation for screwing your customers over. Look for an agent with an ABR designation if you are really worried about this.<p>""it's 6% everywhere... there is no price competition""<p>Wrong. There is no rule that says 6% is mandatory. 5.5% and 5% are very common now. Some homes take a lot of work to sell and find.<p>""They also actively try to control entrance into the profession to make sure everyone tows the line.""<p>Also wrong. There are a plethora of agents in the profession. That there are licensing exams to ensure agents have a requisite level of knowledge about the law, contracts, financing, fair housing laws, etc. and continuing education requirements does not mean they are controlling the entrance into the profession anymore than doctors, lawyers, or accountants do. It means they have serious professional standards because you are screwing around with property, titles, and people's homes.<p>Agents do a <i>lot</i> more than simply list things in MLS and the newspaper. There is a lot of networking behind the scenes that can sell a house quick that FSBO and Redfin are not keyed into. Once you get to negotiations and the closing process, an agent really earns their money by coordinating the necessary inspections, title/legal functions, financing functions, etc. It is naive and risky to think that most of these things can be automated simply.",1206481699

If the system is surrounded by a well designed testing framework, it can be overhauled piece by piece as necessary, no system rewrite required. Test code illustrates what the original programmer expected, and enables a system to be extended without necessarily understanding the theory behind it in its entirety. Of course, most legacy systems don't have good testing frameworks in place these days, so it might take a few years to see if this exception actually holds true or if the testing frameworks tend to get scrapped with the system.",1206481455

He was a hacker, but with great businness sense.<p>""Jobs attended Cupertino Middle School and Homestead High School in Cupertino, California,[9] and frequented after-school lectures at the Hewlett-Packard Company in Palo Alto, California. He was soon hired there and worked with Steve Wozniak as a summer employee.[12] In 1970, Jobs graduated from high school and enrolled in Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Although he dropped out after only one semester,[13] he continued auditing classes at Reed, such as one in calligraphy. ""If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts,"" he said.[14]<p>In the autumn of 1974, Jobs returned to California and began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Steve Wozniak.[15] He took a job as a technician at Atari, a manufacturer of popular video games, with the primary intent of saving money for a spiritual retreat to India. During the 1960s, it had been discovered by phone phreakers (and popularized by John Draper) that a half taped-over toy-whistle included in every box of Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal was able to reproduce the 2600 hertz supervision tone used by the AT&T long distance telephone system. After reading about it and later meeting with John Draper, Jobs and Wozniak went into business briefly in 1974 to build ""blue boxes"" that allowed illicit free long distance calls.""",1206481377

146157,comment,145654,146128,0,0,gruseom,,,"You make a very valid point, one which I think is consistent with what I was saying, though perhaps not obviously so.<p>I'd make a distinction between large production codebases that have been around for a while (let's call that ""legacy code"") and code that illustrates how to do a particular task (let's call that ""sample code""). These are not mutually exclusive; legacy code can be mined for good sample code, and the better systems are rich sources of it. When you're trying to figure out how to do ""particular thing X"" there's no better way than to look at working code that does X.<p>When Naur talks about the theory of a program, though, he's not talking about particular thing X, but about grokking the design and structure of an entire system. That's a hard thing to do for someone who doesn't have contact with the original programmer(s). You don't need that kind of knowledge for tinkering or bug fixing, but it's hard to pull off major design transformations without it.<p>So what I was saying applies to legacy code, but not sample code. This matches experience, I think. When working with legacy systems, I've gotten a great deal of mileage out of asking myself ""how did they do blah"" and then looking to the code for blah to see exactly how they did it. But this only works for relatively constrained problems like ""how did they scale that font"" or ""where did they get that data"". It doesn't work if ""blah"" equals ""producing the whole system"".<p>Web apps illustrate this. We all inspect the code of other web apps to figure out specific techniques. That this is so easy to do is of course one of the biggest reasons for the rise of the web in the first place. But it's orders of magnitude harder to figure out the design of an entire system. I've actually tried - programmatically downloaded as much js and html as I could possibly scrape from another app, to learn whatever I could about how it was put together - and it was a total waste of time.<p>I'm curious to hear if this distinction is relevant to what you were saying.",1206480035

146152,comment,145582,145682,0,0,ess,,,"I believe the problem here is just microfocus. When people focus too much on one thing, they tend not to take a step back every now and then to see if things are still the same as when you started. Let's say I want to start a business in china making valves for microturbines. I spend half a year and progress is very slow. It's time to realise that things are bad, take a step back and review the process. If things are hard, you are doing something wrong.<p>Sometimes it's neccesary to work hard. But sometimes is not a year. One has to take life in 6 month chunks, and you only have about 140 of those. You lose one, you will never get it back. A year is two of those chunks. It's too much time to be unhappy in.<p>I'm one of the fastest developers I know because I was taught the technique - when things start going slow, stop, zoom out and analyse the reason why it's going slow. Then go back in, but approach things differently. This time you want to maintain the quality of work, but reduce the time spent on it. It's not difficult to optimize that.",1206479834

I've been on both sides of this for robotics -- doing research at CMU and doing research at robotics companies.<p>The best approach would be to troll available grants, pick something that you think would be fun to work on, and work on a proposal with a company.<p>Some grants are really easy to get, like SBIRs. Some are designed for collaboration between universities and companies, like STTRs.<p>If you're a self-funded student, you should seriously consider working on whatever you find most interesting, and dedicating serious time to it. Inferior alternatives include focusing on classes and splitting time among a few projects. The ideal grade in a class is the minimal grade needed to pass. That means you're actually spending time on research.<p>Contact companies you think might be interested, and ask what they'd like to see made. Treat it like market research, and not a sales pitch. Don't even ask about a job. Making good things is all you need to do to get a good job.<p>Proposal writing is also a good way to practice both technical writing and product design.",1206479775

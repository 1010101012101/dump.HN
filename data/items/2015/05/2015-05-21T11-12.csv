9582071,comment,9577988,9581785,0,0,bjourne,,,"Well, the reason exceptions should be reserved for exceptional cases
is because they <i>are</i> gotos. There is no way around that, a function
that both returns values and throws exceptions is more complex than
one that doesn&#x27;t because you are jumping through call frames.<p>I once worked with a billing system that threw a BillingException when
a charge didn&#x27;t go through. It works ok, as long as your only response
to such an error is to spew an error message to the user. But the more
you need to handle it, the less an exception makes sense. The code
that tried to handle the BillingException was a tangled mess of try
and catch statemetns mixed with retry loops. For example, if there was
a temporary error at the payment provider, you would just retry a few
times, a permanent error, try with another account, if the customers
remaining funds were to low show an error message or if they were just
a few dollars of, charge them that and be happy we got something from
them.<p>On the other hand, the billing system could also throw a DbException
in case there was something wrong with the database connection. That&#x27;s
a different kind of problem and fatal for a database-backed
website. Nothing to do, except log the error and crash.<p>The point of exceptions is not so much that you can catch and handle
them, but that it separates exceptional situations from in-band normal
error handling. Now what is in-band and what is exceptional depends on
the circumstances which is why, as you say, Boost.ASIO provides both
variants. If your system is supposed to handle the errors, use the one
without exceptions. If not then use the one with exceptions.",1432209163

It has to be to be as customizable as it is. And to get a site going you often need to do a whole bunch of work up-front: configuring views, creating content types, taxonomies, rules, workflows, etc. This is often not needed with Wordpress because you just pick a theme, dump in a few plugins if necessary, and it &#x27;works&#x27;.<p>On the other hand, if you really do need all that customization, you&#x27;re often better off with a proper framework like Ruby on Rails. You can build features in code rather than clicking around the CCK/Fields/Views interfaces, and keep them and other configuration in version control. Most importantly, if you&#x27;re capable of building complex views and workflows in Drupal, you probably have the ability to do so in code as well. And the latter is generally better in every way if you are capable of it.<p>Drupal strikes me as the kind of thing that looks good on paper, and that project managers would like, because <i>in theory</i> it can be customized by anyone, and <i>in theory</i> you can build anything you need with it, all without writing code!<p>In practice, however, you end up paying a lot to get Drupal developers/consultancies to fix whatever mess you&#x27;re left with. And what do most of these shops do? Use things like the Features module to store everything in code/configuration files, which kind of goes against the whole point of using Drupal in the first place.<p>The end result is that nobody is really happy, other than perhaps the Drupal consultants who happen to know the ins and outs of the crufty framework/CMS hybrid, and can charge a premium for their knowledge of the dark internals of Drupal.",1432208452

One thing I like about Feynman is his talks are based on experiments - if you fire electrons at two slits this happens (QED) or if you send them past a magnet that happens (Ch 5). This is in contrast to most popular science books which go on about spooky cats or most academic treatments which launch into a bunch of abstract maths without looking that much at what&#x27;s going on physically.

698951,comment,698494,698733,0,0,sokoloff,,,"Exactly. I bought both my classic Mustangs on Ebay. In both cases, I got the online description and photos, asked the sellers for additional information before bidding. I probably went through some part of this process on over 2 dozen cars, and bid on 5-6 of them<p>Then in each case, at the close of the auction I basically said ""So long as the car basically meets the description as you laid out, you're getting paid, but before you get paid, I'm verifying the basics."" In one case I flew down to get it and paid actual cash. In the other case (much farther away), I had a car club buddy go check it out for basic conformance (title/VIN match, runs/drives, rust no worse than described, etc) at which point I wired the money, my buddy took the title, and I arranged the car transport pickup. One of my cars is as-good/better than was described all around. One of them had a moderate issue which I chalk up to ""well, I still got a smoking deal on it, it's fixed now, and knowing everything, I'd still have done the deal, so...""<p>If you know what you're doing, and want a (relatively) rare particular car, and don't have Barrett-Jackson type money, Ebay's a great place to buy cars.",1247298598

698949,comment,698881,698881,0,0,gaius,,,"The problem with Star Trek is this: it isn't really sci-fi. It's fantasy set in space with technobabble replacing magic spells. Which is fine, but if that's your bag, why not go for real fantasy?<p>And this is annoying because Star Trek could be ""what would the future be like?"". They just have rubbish writers. Let me give you an example, the shields failing is a plot device, the ship is in danger, but it doesn't have to take any damage that would prevent the state of the universe being reset at the end of the episode. But in Enterprise, the writers were too lazy and stupid to come up with something new, so they did exactly the same thing with ""hull polarization"". Drop these writers onto a show about a present-day warship and they'd be stuffed. Whereas BSG's writers would take it in their stride.<p>The hallmark of real grown-up scifi is that state is maintained between episodes.",1247298342
698948,comment,697329,698933,0,0,Shooter,,,"Ah..understood.  He was in the wrong.<p>One of the issues with having a commercial or business broker acting like Redfin is that there are different laws about compensation for commercial real estate than there are for residential real estate.  (Commercial agents and brokers have more rights regarding how long, how much, and under what circumstances they are to be paid, for example.  This is, for the most part, to protect brokers since these deals are much more complicated and they can potentially invest months of their time and hundreds of thousands of dollars marketing a property or doing due diligence, only to have the deal fall through at the last minute.) In any case, there is more legislation you would have to get around to do a commercial Redfin.  I know of a few companies that have tried, but they all went out of business because of expenses or legal issues.<p>BTW, most consumers don't realize it, but there are roughly a dozen states that have made it illegal for brokers to offer rebates to consumers AT ALL, whether residential or commercial.  Sometimes it isn't the real estate companies themselves that are stifling competition and innovation.",1247298306

Someone was pointing out that mercury in fluorescent bulbs was even more hazardous than radioactive waste in a sense, because at least the radioactive waste would eventually decay into something harmless.  The counterpoint was, ""Well, they should just use mercury-194, which decays with a half-life of only 400 years, and turns into gold, to boot.""",1247297770

698936,comment,698716,698855,0,0,jsz0,,,"Safe from what?<p>Safe from misuse by Google? I think that's a risk you take with any third party provider. Being one of many millions of users does provide some security through obscurity in that respect. Chances are most of us are just not special enough to be legitimate targets.<p>Safe from misuse by bad guys outside of Google via security problems? I'm pretty confident Google has some of the best engineers out there. You also have a strength in numbers thing going for you with Google. Lots of people are looking at it. Google is very high profile -- if they did have a leak you'd at least know about it. I can't say the same about some random provider. They could have half wit engineers who cover up data leaks. You might never know. Even bad providers can have sterling record if they choose not to report problems or simply have a run of good luck until someone copy & pastes the wrong command and every bit gets leaked.<p>Safe from being an anonymous fraction of a statistic when Google aggregates its data? I'd be more worried about my ISP spying on me.<p>Overall I think it's good to be aware of the risks but realistically there isn't a whole lot you can do about it no matter which provider you're using. If you were to separate all your different accounts to different providers you might at least spread the risk out. If you choose to run your own server(s) you quickly become the weakest link in the security chain. Even if you're a pro it probably won't be your full time job to administrate your servers so that already puts you at a disadvantage.",1247297365

698933,comment,697329,698873,0,0,silencio,,,"Thanks for the interesting response.<p>Most of the changes were not really about wording, more about the timeline on which certain contingencies were supposed to be met and which boxes should have been checked, which were just mostly blanks on printed forms. The biggest one though and the one that bothered me was a wording change to a contingency involving financing that everyone that had seen the document except for the broker had told me was just not something I could do as-written. I wanted it changed. If he had been upfront about his reluctance to change it because he was trying to cover his ass, that would have been great. If he had just let me change it like I did eventually because I wasn't going to sign anything otherwise, that would have been great. It's really the 'condescending ass' part and that we took (in all, over) 4 hours arguing over a single line that really annoyed me because it was not necessary...or at least, he couldn't explain why he didn't want it changed at all.<p>Anyway, I'm in southern california.

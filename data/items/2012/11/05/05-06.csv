I had your stance on the issue before I read their reasoning (it is absolutely worth the read), and I'm come to realize:<p>1. corporate campaign spending will likely not corrupt the political process<p>2. as we can see since the ruling, very very little independent expenditures are coming from corporations. it's still mostly rich people paying for the commercials, which is what it was like before<p>3. the FEC and the idea of these regulations are completely flawed<p>4. there is no way that these laws will scale passed TV and broadcasting, even though they purport to regulate speech online as well.<p>5. people should be exposed to as much speech as possible, and it should be assumed they can come to conclusions that fit within their interests. Especially in a world where it becomes increasingly difficult for campaigns to sway voters even with billions of dollars of speech.<p>> Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message. [...] Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues. Yet, 441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds.<p>> Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question. Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of speech.<p><a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf</a>",1352094965

Chrome does have some memory issues on it (and I'm considering switching back to Firefox for that laptop), and sometimes compilation times get annoying, but overall, this system has been tweaked and configured to be my ultimate programming machine.<p>Plus, testing server software on slower machines can be helpful to find bottlenecks that might not present themselves as obviously on blazing fast machines.<p>All that said, I'd say we've gotten to the point where a casual user will do just fine with 4-year-old technology.

With most electric cars, you need to compromise on things like performance and range. From all of the reviews I've read, the Tesla Model S a great car, that just happens to be electric.<p>For instance, the Nissan Leaf has a range of 73 miles on a charge, then you have to spend several hours charging it. You can generally do 400 or more miles on a single tank of gas in a reasonably efficient car; and then you can refill in a minute or two and be on your way. The Tesla has a range of 260 miles; much closer to a tank of gas, and a lot less likely to leave you worried that you'll run out of charge.<p>From the reviews I've read, Tesla is also a great car for people who love cars. It can do 0-60 in 4 seconds. It is well put together, with innovative electronics. It makes electric cars sexy, not just something that makes you feel good for saving gas while being kind of a pain to drive.<p>On the other hand, it is considerably more expensive than its competition, and still somewhat limited compared to a gas powered car. While you do get greater range, if you're going on a long road trip, you will need to stop for long recharges.<p>I think part of the excitement is that Elon Musk, and Tesla Motors, are quite committed to pushing for electric cars. They don't make anything else. It's not an electric car from a manufacturer who makes traditional cars, and can fall back on them. They need it to succeed. So they are introducing solar charging stations where you can recharge for free. They are really coming up with an innovative car; I think that of anyone, they do have the best chance to make an electric car that will really take off, but they do have some tough obstacles ahead of them.",1352094780

4742372,comment,4740540,4742054,24,0,xianshou,,,"The crux of your argument is the claim that, if the universe becomes a field of equidistant neutrinos, no action or thought in the meantime matters. The implicit assumption behind this view is that events only matter to the extent that they leave a legacy. In particular, it asserts that things only have ultimate meaning if they extend to temporal infinity. I believe that how one reacts to Curtis's post, and to your statement, depends on the following question: to what extent can something temporary and finite have meaning?<p>Imagine this scenario:<p>A man stands on the shore, miles from any other human presence. He is desolate, alone. For the past twenty years of his life, he has worked ceaselessly on a critical open question in mathematics, the solution to which would make it feasible for humans to travel across galaxies. Educated at the best institutions, mentored by the greatest geniuses of his day, and encouraged by his incredible past successes in the field, he had begun to work on the problem with as great of fanfare as can exist within an academic community. Gradually, as he had toiled without progress, his reputation had faded and he had become increasingly reclusive. Eventually, divorced and estranged from his family, he had pruned away every aspect of his life outside of this one question. The man walks slowly back and forth, wracking his brain for what had gone wrong in all his previous approaches, what key had escaped him.<p>In a blazing flash of insight, he understands. The wrong turns, the twisted equations and garden-path lemmas, the towering perplexity of twenty years - gone. He understands. It is true; it is real. With the mere publication of one proof, even the sketch of the dazzlingly unlikely intuition, humanity will dance across the stars within a century.<p>In the next moment, a titanic wave engulfs the coast, obliterating him in one painless moment.<p>Does his epiphany matter? This is the limit of your supposition: a moment of supreme realization and an achievement that only a few among billions could hope for, lasting as short a time as could matter to a human being. What you think of meaning in human life depends on what you answer to that question. If you believe that his epiphany does matter, you also believe in the meaning of temporary things - of what leaves an impression, but not a legacy.<p>In this case, the ""fight against inertia"" does matter, but only as the genuine pursuit of a deeply felt aim, rather than lust for meaning swaddled in the language of social contribution. To use the language of ""Drive,"" people feel most fulfilled when they have autonomy, mastery, and purpose; less pedantically, we are only happy in the deeper sense when using our abilities to their fullest extent. Chasing your visions and striving for achievement matter as a consequence not of the goal, but of advancing towards it. It is important to know that your goal matters to others, and that you have the means to achieve it, but it does not register on the scale of personal meaning whether it is ever achieved. Only the motion, the overcoming of inertia, differentiates between personal meaning and lack thereof. Mathematically, although everyone's life begins and ends at zero, that fact in no way diminishes the value of the integral in between.<p>Happiness, success, passion and meaning are four qualities that attract some of the most contentious attention from both HN readers and young people in general. I would argue that they share a common quality: they are only achievable at the highest level as byproducts of action, not goals in and of themselves. Pursuing them directly drives them away; if the young Mark Zuckerberg had been in it for the money, he would have gone to Microsoft, and if the young Steve Jobs had made it his goal to find meaning, he would have stayed on perpetual pilgrimage in India instead of starting Apple. The victory of ambivalence and subconcious motives comes from mistaking the yearning towards these things for the path that leads to them.<p>Internalizing death, if you believe in the meaning of temporary things, does justify certain ways of thinking and behaving. It means knowing that you will, relatively soon, be rendered forever passive and motionless. In the meantime, you may as well move.",1352093983

I'd argue that people on the top 1% are statistically people more interested in learning varied subjects.

4742326,comment,4741438,4741438,15,0,tikhonj,,,"Hehe, I was thinking about this recently, and I suspect it's true. I actually spent quite a bit on my current laptop (although, importantly, I optimized for screen resolution, size and weight above sheer performance). Then I looked at my usage patterns.<p>Which program do I use the most? Easy: Emacs and Firefox. Which I could probably run--just as easily--on virtually any computer imaginable.<p>Emacs really speaks for itself; ""eight megabytes and constantly swapping"" is not an insult any more. In the grand scheme of things, Emacs uses essentially no resources.<p>And Firefox is good for two reasons: it's pretty efficient as is, and I don't visit many heavy websites. Hacker News, StackOverflow, Reddit, Google, hackage, Wikipedia and so on could easily be rendered by even the weakest of computers.<p>So I could probably get by almost as comfortably on a ten-year-old laptop. The main problem I would have would be with compilers (especially GHC), but I don't compile large packages all that often. The programs I work on myself are never gigantic. So for my own files, especially without optimizations, compile time would not be an issue even on a smaller machine. And if I'm not using Haskell or OCaml, chances are I'm using something like Scheme or Python or JavaScript, which don't even have compile times.<p>I am definitely sure that I could get by on a significantly weaker computer than somebody with less technical acumen. But would I? No! I love my useless desktop effects, my silly widgets and my 20-second boot. I like my programs opening in seconds. And I certainly enjoy having more computer power than I strictly need.<p>So while I'm pretty sure I require far less computer resources than most people, I'm still going to get a nicer computer than I strictly have to. Just because I can.<p>Just an amusing observation I've had about myself.",1352092308

If one string is secret and the other is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can use a clock and multiple attempts to discover the secret.<p>Obviously this particular one isn&#x27;t relevant to SSL, but there are a number of other possibilities to worry about in most languages, most obviously short-circuiting operations like boolean AND/OR.

Many other industries will ultimately follow suit but until there is more transparency into the small differences (that currently exist) between how, for example, pharmaceutical companies or oil companies operate, no tangible competition or need to separate themselves from the pack will exist.  Once employees truly understand in a more comprehensive way how their employer stands out from the pack in terms of that company&#x27;s social conscience, they have a new way to gauge their decisions as to who to chose as their employer.  I imagine this process (because of many of the ideas presented by others in this thread) would be a slow one, but I get the impression (if dome right) it could have an impact to help force the idea that you will in fact be more successful in the long run if you work hard to differentiate yourself as a socially conscientious employer.",1397007641

That&#x27;s step #1.<p>I completely disagree with others&#x27; calls for a rewrite, and I really don&#x27;t like their attacks on OpenSSL developers (not that I know them or even know who they are.) How many of you have written software that has been tested as thoroughly in the real world as OpenSSL? Some, but not very many, I presume. OpenSSL has an installed base of billions and billions of machines, and it is mostly successful, and any software that sees that much use (and the corresponding scrutiny) is going to have vulnerabilities revealed. We should absolutely not, not, not rewrite the software and open ourselves up to whole new bugs, or worse, bugs that were in OpenSSL and patched years ago. It would be fine to start a <i>new</i> piece of software, with the hope of competing for SSL, but a widespread \ncampaign to replace OpenSSL would be foolish.<p>The only possible caveat to this would be if it was developed more like clean room software a la NASA&#x27;s probe/shuttle software, with every change agreed upon by a large committee of people, and no change made without weeks of planning. If it was replaced by a process so rigorous that it would not admit any bugs the new software might have a chance of competing with OpenSSL. And even then, a committee can&#x27;t think of everything.<p>Everyone is starting from the reference point of perfect security and yet perfect security is impossible.

Mostly there&#x27;s only been cheating by adding pipeline stages or ram latencies to get the frequencies up.<p>Also just before I graduated college in 1999 I remember my VLSI professors talking about how chips had passed the point where the interconnect had a square cross section and were moving to rectangular.  So today chips look like skyscrapers, with tall ribbons of interconnect that suffer from crosstalk.<p>On top of that, there&#x27;s been failure to move to distributed and multicore processing outside of GPUs, or for FPGAs to get adopted by the mainstream.  I&#x27;ve given up on innovation on the hardware front from the big players, but I&#x27;m optimistic that approaches like Google&#x27;s Go running inside hypervisors on diverse hardware is going to bring the high throughput we see in gaming and DSP to the mainstream.

Hi-tech graphics on the keys!<p>We only had one, it was in the library, and you had to 1) sign up for it, and 2) get a pass to leave study hall to come to the library.<p>My math teacher was an easy touch, so I scored a pass every day to go to the library. Unfortunately, other students also wanted to use the computer, and there was quite a bit of hijinks involved with actually making it happen (Hint: never sign up in pencil).<p>I learned how to code going through the Star Trek game and figuring out how it worked.<p>As a side note, my nemesis at the time was Roland. So I spent the formative years of my programming life creating a game called &quot;Kill Roland&quot; in Pet Basic. It was mostly Space Invaders, with a little bit of Star Trek thrown in. Little Rolands (&quot;R&quot;s) would come down from the top of the screen, you would use the arrow keys to move your guy around at the bottom, and the space bar launched missiles. There were smart missiles, that you could control after firing, heat seekers, and so on. Of course, the Rolands just kept coming, more and more of them (at times splitting in 2)<p>All the other kids at the library loved that game. Roland, not so much.<p>Fun times.

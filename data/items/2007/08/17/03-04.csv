They raised a lot of money too fast and the VC appointed board started to take control and make bad calls. The board was focusing on the wrong problems but the founders didnt have the power to change direction. So yeah it can be bad...",1187323081
43344,comment,43304,43304,0,0,rams,,,"Damn, I am working on a python script to do simultaneous range requests and 'am hoping to release it as open source by October. @work, lots of ISOs get transferred over the network all the time; even on a fast network, it's a pain with uncached images. @home I download OS iso's quite often. This is a great source of pain for me and I am pretty sure for a lot of other people as well - hope the Cloudant guys pull it off. But they need a way to figure out how to throttle bandwidth usage. <p>BTW, is there such a thing as universal mind ? How come you think about something and very soon you find out someone else doing something with more or less the same idea ;-)",1187322487

Silicon valley wasn't built on open source....<p>Besides, plenty of hackers do interesting stuff outside outside the open source world (and that's not even considering hardware...).",1187322002

43336,comment,43195,43286,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Funny you should mention Lawrence and Austin in the same post. As a current resident of Lawrence, I can attest that this would be a great town to start a startup in, but there seems a definite lack of interest from the CS grads. Everyone seems bent on a big paycheck at Sprint or Cerner or Garmin.<p>I actually like Austin because it's like a bigger Lawrence, but never actually lived there.<p>All I really wish is for a place with a bunch of nerds and some fiber-to-the-home. Sadly, AT&T owns us here and something that fast will probably never happen.",1187320244

You can live within walking distance of world-class restaurants, great music venues, convenient public transportation and the most breathtaking architecture in America -- all for a fraction of the cost of living you'd find in San Francisco, New York, Boston or DC.<p>Then there's the demographic breakdown. If I'm building a Web application that I intend to market to normal people -- i.e., NOT the types of people who read 96 RSS feeds a day and obsess over TechCrunch -- I'd rather live in a place where my friends are, well, diverse. Chicago has a strong economy with no clear dominating industry. There's strength in diversity.<p>Not that there isn't a tech scene here. The Tech Cocktail events (semi-regular gatherings of 500+ local tech people) have been well-attended, and the Chicago Python Users Group is a great bunch of people. During a recent Chicago visit, a Bay Area resident told me he was astounded by how much more active the Chicago Python group was than the Bay Area one.<p>I have very little experience raising startup money, so I can't comment about the availability of VC or angel funding in Chicago. But are you really going to move somewhere just to get funding? What does it say about the quality of your idea if you feel like it will only succeed if you live in a certain part of the U.S.?",1187319884

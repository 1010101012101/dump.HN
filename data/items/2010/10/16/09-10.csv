1797686,comment,1795415,1795850,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Slim paid an obscenely low price for Telmex – it was making $1.1 billion yearly profit, and Slim’s company paid less than $900 million for a 10% stake<p>So he paid $900 million for $110 annual profits? So a P/E of around 8? That's not an obscenely low price, especially if they already had complete market share and premium pricing. The only way to go from there is down, and it's a high capital business that'd most like need lots of capital improvements to stay competitive. For comparison, AT&T is trading a 12 times earnings, but that's in a much more healthy and stable market than Mexico.<p>I guess getting a 10% stake at 8 times earnings is an okay deal, but it doesn't jump out to me as a great deal. Would you be excited to buy a stake at that price in a high capital Mexican business with no growth potential because it's tapped out? I wouldn't.",1287223181

There were a couple gems, but mostly low quality stuff I wouldn't expect to sell for much in the market (no offense to those posting).<p>What did interest me was Jason's offer to partner up with good domain names.  Jason certainly brings a lot more star power than most people but he's got a small set of domains.<p>What would people say about partnering up with 'real' domain investors?  I am talking the guys who buy and sell domains for a living.<p>I am not sure what the interest would be from others in the domain industry but as a domain investor, I would love opportunities to partner with the most talented developers and give access to some premium names.  I watch many others in my business trying to develop on their own, it's a huge challenge and most don't have technical skills.<p>Would HN be interested in such an opportunity?  What sort of legal arrangements/structure to the deals would you think are reasonable/expect?",1287223077

Or, most dismal, to drag an accused adulterer or blasphemer to the soccer stadium for execution.”</i><p>Given that this story was recently submitted, it can be gathered that the tattoos observed by David Kilcullen were not from Taliban fighters in 2001.<p>The article does not indicate any of the tattooed insurgent fighters are Taliban, or even Muslim.<p>My original point being, every religion has various tenets which are followed/obeyed in different degrees by various members of said religion.

1797676,comment,1797394,1797394,0,0,lionhearted,,,"If you have SEO, do a <i>slow</i> transition. Don't just put a 301 in place and assume it'll work. I did a transition once and then all the links dropped out of Google, and it cost, I don't know how much, but a lot of lost revenue. Re-write any SEO pages on the new site with different language (but the same keyword density and basic idea), change as many backlinks as you can, and have the old site's pages link to the new site at first. Once the new site is ranking on the frontpage, then maybe put a 301 in place and that should get you close to the top of where you were at. I'm all for fast action, but not on this particular score. Transition slowly. Good luck.",1287222143

Intelligence services are constantly going through <i>massive</i> amounts of information trying to pick out credible threats. When they eventually miss one, sure, it looks obvious in retrospect. But I bet there's dozens of ""kill the evil Westerners"" speeches happening in third world countries around the world right now.

1797653,comment,1795182,1795182,0,0,jaaron,,,"So, I'm not a huge GitHub fan for open source projects.  Why?  Because while it's a great site and tool (don't get me wrong, I can understand the attraction), GitHub can be a pain in the ass for end users.  How so?  I don't know how many times I've found some code I wanted to use only to find a dozen or more forks, none of which have been merged back together and a handful of which have patches I'm interested in.  It's way, way too easy in GitHub for the community to get <i>lost</i> in the forks.  There's no clear mechanism for communication (mailing list, forums, etc.) and not enough pressure to merge code back into a common repository.  Sure it democratizes contributions, but it also makes a mess.<p>There's a real need and advantage to having a canonical, master repository - something users can trust that's been properly vetted, tested and debugged.  There's a lot of value in a single place for discussion with public, searchable archives so that users can learn the project history, why decisions were made and, if necessary, ask new questions.  There's nothing worse than having to use Google to search blogs for outdated documentation and discussions split across little more than tweets.<p>GitHub encourages <i>forking</i> but it doesn't necessarily encourage <i>merging</i>.  Successful open source projects which a large, invested user base require a bit more structure, stability and developer support than GitHub encourages.  It may be a great place to start a project, but at some point, I can see projects graduating to their own infrastructure and a real, organized community.",1287220399

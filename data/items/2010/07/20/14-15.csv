1532234,comment,1531882,1532026,0,0,jmillikin,,,"Monads are used for abstracting computation composition. In any given Haskell code, I'd say at least 80% of my monadic code is non-imperative. There are imperative monads (ST, IO), but also many many functional ones. I've written an introductory article at < <a href=""http://ianen.org/articles/monad-is-not-difficult/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ianen.org/articles/monad-is-not-difficult/</a> >.<p>The first example in the article demonstrates what I mean by ""computation composition"". ""mdiv(2.0, 3.0)"" returns a Maybe, not a float, and before using it as a float the inner value must be unpacked. That can be done without the monad operators, but is verbose and error-prone:<p><pre><code>  mdiv :: Float -> Float -> Float\n  mdiv a b = if b == 0\n  	then Nothing\n  	else Just (a / b)\n\n  with_maybe :: Maybe Float\n  with_maybe = case mdiv 2.0 2.0 of\n  	Nothing -> Nothing\n  	Just val1 -> case mdiv 3.0 0.0 of\n  		Nothing -> Nothing\n  		Just val2 -> case mdiv val1 val2 of\n  			Nothing -> Nothing\n  			Just val3 -> Just val3\n</code></pre>\nHere's that same example, rewritten to use the monadic operators (with explicit lambdas, as in the article):<p><pre><code>  with_maybe :: Maybe Float\n  with_maybe =\n  	mdiv 2.0 2.0 >>= (\val1 ->\n  	mdiv 3.0 0.0 >>= (\val2 ->\n  	mdiv val1 val2 >>= (\val3 ->\n  	Just val3)))\n</code></pre>\nAnd, for completeness, using Haskell's lambda-hiding 'do' notation:<p><pre><code>  with_maybe :: Maybe Float\n  with_maybe = do\n  	val1 <- mdiv 2.0 2.0\n  	val2 <- mdiv 3.0 0.0\n  	val3 <- mdiv val1 val2\n  	Just val3</code></pre>",1279637872

1532229,comment,1531843,1531994,0,0,patrickk,,,"Being mistrustful of copyright laws seems to be a hacker ethic. The price of an open web is to tolerate a certain amount of piracy. Sure, you <i>could</i> stamp out 99% of piracy on the web, by logging usage, throttling traffic, suing teenagers and deploying other heavy-handed tactics. But at what cost? I would argue that having an open web is better than trying to prune it to perfection. You will snuff out innovation and kill future Googles (do you think Google who have grown and thrived in AOL's walled garden?). Of couse, this isn't even factored into the equation when arguing against piracy because it's all 'what if'.<p>How many people here on HN have used pirated software to help build a web app? Quite a few I'd bet. If your fledging web app is a success, whose software are you gonna buy when you are successful? The one you 'test-drove' as a pirate of course. Remember Jobs and Woz used a 'blue box' to get free long distance calls on AT&T's network. Their next idea was the Apple I. Fast forward to the 2000's and the iPhone is making At&T billions. If this scene played out today, they would've probably been sued into oblivion or arrested by the FBI., and Apple would never have been.<p>Why do you think the tech industry and the web grew out of America and not some other wealthy country? It's because America tolerates a certain amount of rebellious, anti-authoritarian behavior (among other things).<p>Pg talkes about this much better than I can in his essay about the nature of hackers:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html</a><p>""<i>Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd want to go out and investigate. Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. So if they're all squawking, perhaps there is something amiss.<p>Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America, will actually harm it?

It means that you compare your product with ""perfection"", instead of comparing it with ""nothing"" (ie. it not existing at all.) If you tend to be critical, and quickly notice faults and omissions, then <i>you may be a perfectionist</i>. It seems to me that perfectionism is the number one reason why many programmers aren't successful in business.

With Haskell I always end up writing more code to deal with the state than I would like to. And by judging other people's code to do similar things (like a vector graphics on the screen in a game or demo) it doesn't seem to get too pretty there either.<p>Haskell would be a more practical and smoother language by a tenfold if it just went ahead and accepted that I want to do impure things occasionally, and gave me pragmatic tools to do that. Don't say monads, they feel phony given the simplicity of what I need from them. I chose the word artillery because monads are a Goldbergesque way to achieve writing a pointer to some place in memory.<p>FYI, I do champion Clojure much more than complain about Haskell, but I occasionally do the latter as well in order to reconsider my criticism. And I retry with Haskell from time to time, to see if the feel of the language would finally make me overcome the resistance.",1279636692
1532179,comment,1531441,1532090,0,0,klodolph,,,"True, that.  For some functions, memoization in Haskell is dead easy.  Like ""fibs"", which is generally a poor example function but it illustrates a technique you can use for dynamic programming in Haskell that doesn't work in strict languages:<p><pre><code>    fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\n</code></pre>\nNow, I don't know if this technique works for the function you're interested in.  If you want something more general, you can do soemthing like:<p><pre><code>    memoize :: Ord a => (a -> b) -> IO (a -> b)\n    memoize f = do\n        ref <- newIORef Map.empty\n        return $ \x -> unsafePerformIO $ do\n            m <- liftM (Map.lookup x) (readIORef ref)\n            case m of\n                Just y -> return y\n                Nothing -> let y = f x\n                           in do modifyIORef ref (M.insert x y)\n                                 return y\n</code></pre>\nThat's just off the top of my head (probably has syntax errors, never mind the type checker), and it has a number of drawbacks.  For one, the map will get larger and larger -- you could use a LRU purging scheme but that's more work than I'm doing today.  It doesn't support polymorphic functions, this could be fixed with some extra care but because of the way ""memoize"" would have to work you'll need to know a decent amount about the Haskell type system.<p>There, I responded to llimllib's ultimatum that somehow my conclusion was incorrect if I didn't personally know how to implement a memoization function.  Can I have a cookie?<p>That rant at the end of my post above was me venting frustrations, on a lot of Haskell forums I see people posting about how much they think Haskell is not the language for them and I think, ""If it's not for you, can you go to a forum that's not about Haskell?""",1279636667

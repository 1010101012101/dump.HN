3843476,comment,3824247,3828086,1,0,kelnos,,,"That's the rub, though, isn't it?  ""When used properly"".  PHP doesn't at all encourage you to use it properly.  It doesn't define what ""properly"" is.  The original article detailing PHP's fractally-bad design gave an impressive list of PHP's design flaws and all of the broken things it can do to you.  If you know these things and know how to avoid them, you're golden.  But who (especially new programmers) can be expected to know all those things?<p>I also think C++ is a pretty bad language, but you can do some very impressive and clean -- and most importantly, maintainable -- things with it if you use it properly.  Unfortunately there are lots of definitions that people have come up with that detail the ""proper"" subsets of C++ that are safe to use, with disagreement on a bunch of things.  (And for the love of $DEITY, please don't lump C++ in with C, which is really a beautiful, amazing language.)",1334490923

I think if we had a new world war between two highly sophisticated nations, we would have posters like this lying lying in the streets. Apparently now the idea of men being biologically stupider than women is an acceptable opinion. I know we smile at these posters and say in our heads ""well they don't actually mean it like this"" but there is a bad aftertaste.<p>Personally, I rather like the idea that we are all equal but different.
There is so much ideological talk about these things and nobody seems to ask any deeper questions. If boys are underperforming in school, does that mean they are stupid?
Admittedly, it seems boring. Intuitively we all ""kinda"" know this can't be true, but who has the time to care about these things? By accident I stumbled upon this, which was a very refreshing take on many downtrodden paths of what is discussed over and over again:

3843447,comment,3841016,3841636,6,0,kelnos,,,"1.  I've never bought this argument.  ""You have to do hard work that you don't want to do because it builds character.""  Why?  Are there no other ways to build character?  There are forms of hard work that you can enjoy.  I worked 16-hour days 6/7 days a week for over a year once.  In hindsight, I realize that was a terrible, terrible idea, and in the end I was bitter and burned out.  But before that happened, I loved it and was passionate about it.  It was definitely difficult and tiring work, and I learned a lot about myself and other people during the process, and have since moved on to something I'm just as passionate about, but that comes with balance.  Maybe working a mind-numbing and/or back-breaking job for that period would have taught me the same things, but I prefer the path that I took.  And hell, there's nothing that says someone can't have a passion for certain kinds of hard physical labor, too.<p>2.  You can learn things about yourself through a variety of ways.  This just seems so limiting.  Maybe you think making fancy widgets at age 22 is the best thing ever and will make you happy because you love it.  Maybe you try it, and it turns out to be a terrible idea.  Maybe you learn something incredibly valuable by failing.  You have the rest of your life to ""get things right"".  Your early 20s are the best time to screw up by experimenting with different paths.  Once you have a family, a mortgage, etc., it's harder to be irresponsible.  (Jeez, I feel like I'm pitching ""why you should start a startup"" with this one.)<p>3.  It's very rare that a particular piece of advice can be taken by everyone.  Most advice has a limited audience.  In this case that audience was a graduating class at a college in an affluent country.  Telling a group of people who have the means to ""play"" and why not playing is undesirable needn't be denigrating to those who do not.  There's a difference between putting down the ""bad"" jobs, and putting down the people who perform them.  Grellas, your parents sound like amazing people, but I doubt they enjoyed the fact that they had to move to a new country and work themselves to the bone to better their conditions.  It must have been very difficult to do that, and, all things being equal, I would hope that a sane person would prefer life without restrictions over one with many.<p>I loved this piece.  A little iffy on the ""don't tell the truth"" part, but I think it just wasn't communicated well and came off more ""always lie"" than the author intended.  I want to play.  I have the means to do so.  I just need to figure out what playing means to me.  The bit on loving someone also struck a chord with me, especially the bit about society being anti-love.  Rejecting someone requires but one reason, loving someone requires acceptance of everything.  Very poignant.",1334489813

As a result you can find 10 or 20 programs written in JavaScript where each looks like it was written in a quite different language. Maybe it was an attempt to make an ""easy"" language for non-programmers (I doubt even this goal was in the end achieved), but as a primary language for programming client-side applications it is a utter disappointment. Not that I necessarily blame the JavaScript creator, I am sure there were plenty of corporate pressures involved and other factors of corporate/economic nature.<p>I wish we could get some other programming language implemented in all the major browsers, then at least in the perspective of the next 10 years we could completely get rid of JavaScript, I am not sure if it possible to really improve the situation in a radical way just via incremental changes to the existing design.",1334489268

Objective-C is a language that, while cool and innovative for the early 1980's, is totally dated (even with Applet's recent updates) and just plain failed in the market. It would have been extinct long, long go if not for Apple buying NeXT and then dragging Obj-C into OSX and iOS and making its use mandatory in practice. Despite the existence of other implementations such as GNU's (including the OpenStep libraries), Obj-C's usage is basically zero in any platform where developers can make the choice; and this holds true even today, after a large number of new developers learned it again due to iOS's popularity.",1334488174

I'd also love suggestions for what other data providers you'd like to see.

Not some stupid alternative implementation intended to show that Python is slow, but which nobody would ever actually use.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s nonsense to discard Python with NumPy as an option for fast computations just because we can imagine an imaginary world where NumPy was written differently, purely to penalize this environment for having used more than one language.<p>To be honest, we should benchmark what we actually have, not imaginary made-up handicapped versions of the things we are judging.",1398859181

Nothing in /etc is editable, everything goes through /etc/nixos/configuration.nix followed by a `nixos-rebuild switch` (does the entire build before atomically switching) and a `nixos-rebuild switch --rollback` (takes a few seconds) if you panic.\nThe configuration is just a Nix expression so you can do whatever you like with it, it&#x27;s not like a JSON file but actually integrates with your packages, allowing you to override settings etc. There are options which are the same as USE flags, for example you can turn off X with `environment.noXlibs=true` and the entire system would be rebuilt without X.\nIt&#x27;s at the same time much simpler than portage and much more expressive.",1398858854

As a rule most of these attackers don&#x27;t really know what afick is or if they do they simply don&#x27;t care, most wordpress attacks are for the purposes of malware/SEO spam, so it&#x27;s really a numbers game, figuring out how to quietly subvert afick is a waste of time for them.<p>More to the point I don&#x27;t use afick as a detection system but more as a cleanup tool. Typically in most wordpress hacks (I&#x27;ve probably dealt with about 8-10) you&#x27;ll find that the attackers will target the theme because typically if you &quot;replace all the files on the site&quot; you <i>can&#x27;t</i> replace the theme, it&#x27;s unique, unless you&#x27;ve got a clean copy from a backup (assuming you know when the hack took place) then you can&#x27;t easily replace it with known good code.<p>But the theme is also the part of the site that changes least, so even an afick database from the first day of the site is sufficiently useful in seeing what files (php, js) have been altered.<p>Typically, I end up installing afick after I get called in to clean up an existing hack. If it&#x27;s been hacked once, it may well get hacked again, so I install afick to make the cleanup job easier the second time around.",1398857867

7672545,comment,7669836,7671160,3,0,thibauts,,,"If you look closely in the original smalltalk definitions you&#x27;ll also see that separation of view and controller was intended first and foremost as a way to swap multiple views for the same controller, assuming those views shared controls and interaction patterns. This may have made sense in the context it was designed in : rendering was closer to raw painting on a canvas, mixing event handling with painting code would probably have been ugly. In my opinion it makes much less sense in a browser where the rendering layer is almost entirely in the runtime and building UIs is pretty trivial. We all feel something is wrong because, well, something very is wrong with MVC in the client. Where to we &quot;render&quot; ? To the DOM. Where do user interactions come from ? From the DOM, through events. We already have the controller-view part, and it&#x27;s the DOM. Everything we are doing, stated or not, is adding layers on top of it to make things simpler to manage. Glorified helpers.<p>Same goes for the model. If you don&#x27;t like to duplicate information for the sake of it, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to note that models on the client should be ... well, <i>are</i> a glorified caching mechanism. All these MV* models are in my opinion strongly hindering creativity and progress.<p>In this respect, I think React is onto something big.",1398855694

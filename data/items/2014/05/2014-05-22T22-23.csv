Quite sadly, this has already happened and is quite evident if one steps out of the stats bubble. Statistics could have been what machine learning and datamining is now, been the main driving force, the owner of initiative. On the contrary other communities are using statistics and probability motivated approaches but engineering them well to grab (funding) attention, well deserved in my opinion. It is them who are pushing the frontier of influence.<p>I have not taken a wholesale plunge into Julia yet, but to me one of its significant aspects that I think does not get enough attention among its many nice features is the break away from the &quot;vectorization&quot; paradigm.<p>Complain about speed to a Numpy or Octave person and a common stock response would be &quot;but it dispatches to high-speed precompiled C loops and so is just as fast.&quot; This ignores the fact that these precompiled loops are typically too general and target the worst possible data patterns and have to be defensive. Thus they have do more work than a corresponding loop on array a C, C++ or a Fortran programmer would have written. Further, the vectorization approach typically requires more loops and more memory to fill out, not only those temporaries that are created within the vectorization operations, but extra objects required to write the operation as a vector expression in the first place.<p>Numpy&#x27;s broadcast does eliminate a lot of  extra memory allocation at the cost of some more indexing work. Matlab did not have this for the longest time. Another Numpy  tool that is great is numexpr <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/</a>. So much so that if a colleague complains about numpy being slow I playfully refuse to take a look till whatever can be numexper&#x27;ed has been numexper&#x27;ed. It tries to elide temporaries and parallelize operations. The general bottomline remains, (i) individual primitives have to do more work and (ii) the primitives have to be called more often (iii) needs more memory copies.<p>Julia&#x27;s approach is quite fresh in this regard, so is Haskell&#x27;s loop fusion based array primitives. The problem with Haskell is that these optimizations can be very opaque unless you are an expert. A small change can make your code go 30 times faster, and similarly a small change can make it 30 times slower.<p>An aspect of vectorization that I do like a huge lot is their terse expressiveness. Code is a lot shorter and once you are used to it, such code is easy to read. So I thought I would miss this aspect in Julia, but then I was pointed to devectorize.jl on HN and its aimed to address this very issue.",1400799227

7787059,comment,7784873,7786398,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a correct analysis. As far as I know, anyone who can pass the knowledge test can get a cab license, so it&#x27;;s not like there&#x27;s a quota on the number of cab drivers or something, as you find with many US taxi monopolies (and which I have no time for).<p>Having service standards isn&#x27;t exactly the same as protectionism. For example, it&#x27;s easy to see the problems that would arise if someone just bought a bus, painted it in the same livery as public transit buses, and started picking up passengers on a popular route. I find the Black Cab situation interesting for similar reasons - they&#x27;re not regular cars with a taxi sign on the side, but special-purpose vehicles, capable of accommodating a wheelchair, with the ability to use transit lanes, and so on. I think their beef with the regulator seemingly dumping licensing requirements on a whim is quite understandable from an economic point of view.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that regulations governing cabs in London are <i>not</i> the result of regulatory capture by market incumbents, but were drafted centuries ago to deal with a tragedy of the commons problem, ie too many horse-drawn carriages causing traffic problems. The distinctive design of the modern cab (which are made by two firms, a British one that just does taxis, and also by Mercedes-Benz) meets standards set many years ago for ground clearance, disability access, and turning radius. Taxi firms have often asked for conditions to be relaxed over the years (especially the turning circle requirement, which allows cabs to do u-turns in places that would be impossible for other vehicles) but they remain pretty stringent.",1400799086

How we never have a situation where a user is told that they are <i>obviously</i> wrong. /end snark.<p>Having said that, I sympathize with where you are coming from. However, you have to realize a few things:<p>1. R comes from a community designed to create things that are correct, a community where data is typically cleaned and small enough that sophisticated mathematical models exist. Most large data set + large sophisticated models problems can be broken down into test in R and then write C++ code.<p>2. On the cryptic function names, there is an element of inspiration from Mathematical symbology, it makes it easier to take a proof and turn into code.<p>3. Yeah, I got nothing on the data types. They confuse me as fuck as well.<p>4. R has ggplot2. This is amazing. I am a firm believer that a data scientist is nothing if they can&#x27;t visualize their data. And yet, nothing comes close to ggplot2. This comes from a guy who will grab an ML engineer and talk their head off on the joys of d3.<p>Now having said that, I do hope for another great language to emerge. The closest for me has been Matlab, second best numpy. Somehow a paid  software really fucking incentivizes people to clean their shit and make a solid product.

Instruction based obfustication takes common instructions like mov eax, 0xff and replaces them with more complex instructions that do the same thing but in a very indirect way while other common methods include mostly name mangling, compression, and encryption. To modify the code or dump it, you need the unpacker to somehow decrypt the code and load it into memory.<p>The point of FHE, however, is to encrypt private data to send it to a third party to perform operations on that data without that third party having the keys necessary to decrypt the data (and thus see what it is).

This only makes sense if one assumes that addressing bigger problems is not of increasing importance in data science – which seems counterfactual, to say the least.<p>&quot;R’s speedy vectorization features&quot; mentioned in the article are not actually features – they are limitations. In R (and Python and Matlab), you <i>have</i> to write vectorized code because using a for loop is slow. In Julia, you can choose which approach is better for you and for the problem at hand. Want to write vectorized code? Not a problem. Want to use a for loop? Also not a problem. Want to use recursion? Yes, <i>even</i> that is ok.<p>I also find it interesting that the poster of this article is self-described as an &quot;octave core dev&quot; ;-)",1400798589

The IPCC also to some degree <i>generates</i> the consensus it is supposed to be merely reporting on, in that the lead authors have been known to push specific articles into print supporting &quot;their side&quot; of things and delay articles supporting &quot;the other side&quot; <i>with IPCC deadlines in mind</i> so that their side gets the last word. That&#x27;s one part of the process where excess alarmism gets to creep in. On the other side, your sources are correct that the result then gets massaged into acceptability. The &quot;summary for policymakers&quot; in particular is the result of political compromises - various country&#x27;s representatives argue about it and then the rest of the document in some cases gets rewritten to reflect what the summary says, leaving nobody happy.<p>Nonetheless, the IPCC documents aren&#x27;t terrible and do tend to be worth reading if you really want to know what&#x27;s going on.<p>On being &quot;past skepticism&quot;: The most credible skeptics tend to be &quot;lukewarmers&quot;. They believe reality is a bit more complicated and uncertain than has been portrayed, they tend to suspect climate sensitivity is a lot lower than the models predict and they tend to be suspicious of doomsday claims generally. But almost nobody at this point doubts &quot;CO2 is a greenhouse gas&quot; or that the planet has warmed, so all those &quot;97% agree!&quot; articles miss the point - the skeptics &quot;agree&quot; too.<p>A couple good blogs for credible &quot;skeptical&quot; views are:\n<a href=""http://judithcurry.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://judithcurry.com/</a>\n<a href=""http://climateaudit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climateaudit.org/</a><p>And a good blog for credible &quot;alarmist&quot; views is:\n<a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/</a><p>(the most <i>popular</i> source for skeptical views is probably <a href=""http://wattsupwiththat.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wattsupwiththat.com</a> and the most <i>popular</i> source for alarmist views is probably skepticalscience.

7786925,comment,7785388,7785388,19,0,IgorPartola,,,"So there is a lot of sentiment that I&#x27;ve been hearing over time about when exactly will IPv6 become a thing. Here&#x27;s how I see it:<p>Step -1: We started running out of IPv4 addresses. The internet is IPv4-only for all practical purposes. Nobody is doing IPv6 because it&#x27;s still experimental. Your weird neck-bearded friends are talking about it, that&#x27;s about it.<p>Step 0: Inception! IPv6 is now a standard and you can route IPv6 over the tubes. Two networks have connected!<p>Step 1: Dual stack is a thing. Now you can set up both IPv4 and IPv6 on the same network and they co-exist. Some hosts (goole.com, facebook.com) try this and finally turn it on for good in 2012.<p>Step 2: Dual stack intensifies. This is where we are now. You cannot yet run a full blown IPv6-only network that you want to talk to the Internet and do anything practical with it, but all your cleanly shaven friends are now telling you that you should support IPv6 first, then add IPv4 for compatibility. Google sees as much as 3.5% of their traffic over IPv6.<p>Step 3: The cost of any single IPv4 address rises dramatically. For an end user it&#x27;s already roughly $1/month. Buying in bulk is much cheaper, but not free like it used to be. ISP&#x27;s and other service providers (Amazon, Rackspace, Digital Ocean) are going to start noticing the costs on their bottom lines. Severe restrictions are imposed by IPS&#x27;s and service providers on anything but the bare minimum of IPv4 usage.<p>Step 4: The future. The first IPv6-only networks start to pop up. They use special network translation to talk to IPv4-only internet. (You can do this at home now! It&#x27;s called NAT64: <a href=""http://www.litech.org/tayga/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.litech.org/tayga/</a>).<p>Step 5. The number of IPv6-only networks is growing rapidly. IPv4 is now a legacy protocol. All your friends are telling you that they cannot believe we are still using IPv4 and how much of a pain it is to support it. Sales of T-shirts with &quot;There is no place like 127.0.0.1&quot; drop dramatically.<p>Step 6. The same people that put together IPv6 World Launch Day put together an IPv4 funeral. Major companies turn off IPv4 presence.<p>The crucial point here is not that someone demands IPv6 by calling their ISP, etc. It is fun to play with and you should at least get a tunnel set up through Hurricane Electric if you are reading this, but the demand here <i>does not matter</i>. What matters is supply: supply of IPv4 that is. Once that goes to nil, the cost rises and some executive at every ISP and service provider has a bright idea to save the company millions by switching everyone to IPv6. That&#x27;s it. We, the people in the trenches, cannot affect this. We cannot speed it up and we cannot slow it down. The invisible hand of the market will make IPv6 happen all on its own.",1400797427

Not on any level. Also your &quot;not to any significant extent&quot;, I reject that. I&#x27;m sorry but you&#x27;re wrong about that too.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not suggesting you shower in bleach, just that you wash yourself with something more effective than fairy dust.&quot;<p>This is simple: There is one human being alive responsible for your safety. You&#x27;ll find him in a mirror. I, and every other living being is absolved of responsibility for your health.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but if your personal defects make it dangerous for you to be near humans in a normal social setting, I suggest protecting yourself instead of a) blaming others or b) suggesting others protect you on your behalf.<p>You might find this weird but attempting to enforce a monoculture of hygiene because you think it&#x27;s right is draconian, impossible, and naive to me.",1400796068

You could approximate it by increasing the mortgage rate, but the tax treatment of mortgage insurance payments may be different and so that may not be accurate. Perhaps this is something we can add in the next iteration of the calculator.<p>The interaction between down payment rate and mortgage insurance rate also reveals a limitation of our user interface: On the one hand, it’s nice to have all the variables decoupled so that you can set and explore them independently. On the other hand, many of the variables are not independent. If you change one variable, you may need to change other variables to maintain a realistic scenario.<p>Having the mortgage insurance rate tightly coupled to the down payment would probably be too limiting, but maybe there’s a still a way to better identify when certain variables (or combination of variables) are unrealistic.",1400796049

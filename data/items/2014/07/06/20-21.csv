If only 18% of the tech graduates are women, why do people (see wsj articles and random blogs) complain about companies &quot;gender imbalance&quot;[1] (not hiring 50% women and 50% men)? Wouldn&#x27;t that be positive discrimination?\nAs this article states, 18.2% of the graduates are women, but only 15% of the employees share the same gender, so the gap is 3.2%. Personally, I don&#x27;t consider that 3.2% as being hugely discriminatory, but rather expected, see below.<p>The problem starts even before formal education. In the country I was raised in, young women get an education which can be summarized by &quot;get a husband to take care of you, cook and have his children&quot;. As long as parents have this mentality, their girls get no incentive to continue with college or anything technical, because this path is unknowingly inhibited since childhood. Most developed countries rely heavily on imported workforce, so a lot of Yahoo&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s employees come from countries where the percentage of women graduating in tech is far less than the 18.2% of women graduating in the US.",1404680241

And maybe your retort would be, &quot;Well duh, the checklist theory outlined here could be applied to a large group of prospective suitors to efficiently filter them&quot;...well, then why was that not the example to begin with?

Anyone who has ever done multi-mic recording can attest to the very real effect you can hear from lack of phase alignment, even if they have bronze ears. Even worse is if you duplicate two musical recordings and offset one, even by a tiny amount.<p>This is a critical aspect of crossovers- since they contain the same signal, any phase differences between the intersecting components are easy to pick up by the ear and very difficult to measure since it won&#x27;t show up as a significant frequency or amplitude differential. In the highly acoustically sensitive area where the crossover occurs, the phase distortion between the two signals is hard to pin down but it&#x27;s definitely there, it&#x27;s easy to hear by A/Bing.<p>I mix on a multiple-monitor setup and the one that is most critical to me sounds like absolute garbage. However, it has a wonderfully &quot;flat&quot; response and allows you to get an idea of what proven aesthetically-unpleasing issues are present. It has no crossover. The goal is not to have perceived rumble, tinniness, or mud on any of the incredibly wide range of listening systems out there.

Building that, and thinking through the issues, and building solutions, will give you a lot of feel for building microservices.<p>Rails (specifically v4 in API-mode, which avoids a lot of MVC stuff) is actually quite cool for microservices, where you can leverage its filters and gems to provide cross service functionality -- like the token handling I alluded to above.<p>(As an aside: if you do do the above, you&#x27;ll probably find that you need some sort of &quot;system/root&quot; user access to some services. The &quot;obvious&quot; solution is to create such a user with super powers (that only the system can use). However, think through the implications of this -- massive potential security hole -- and other ways in which you can provide the required services. Actually, thinking about it, that might be a prescriptive rule: never create a super/root user -- that&#x27;s not to say that a user can&#x27;t have, say, an admin role.)",1404678682

The smartest play is to not be relevant either to Mark Zuckerberg, or the criminals who steal his stuff.<p>You are justifying violence, aggression, and theft.  This is not really a position I am <i>surprised</i> to see being upvoted, but I am rather disappointed that you haven&#x27;t had any worthy challengers, either.<p>The fact of the matter is that the state of nature is utterly arbitrary, now.  If we decide not to kill each other, we do not kill each other.  We do not randomly kill anyone without actually deciding to do it; failing to acknowledge the culpability of killers, and those who prepare to do killing above all else, is why we have killers.<p>In an ideal, natural state, equilibrium will be attained, for that is the nature of the universe at large.  It takes an obtuse intrusion of life to impede upon the natural entropy of the universe; decide to kill, and then kill, and you&#x27;ll be doing something that does not happen anywhere else, provably, yet in the wider known universe.  It is a unique and utterly self-perpetuating circumstance, murder.  It cannot occur without life making the effort to proceed with the act.<p>And the fact of the matter is, trillions of dollars worth of decisions have been made, by a tragically small elite, in the name of the whole - to kill.  This is the responsibility of everyone who allows those dollars to persist as currency in global communication; the fallacy of irresponsibility nevertheless allows for continued acts of overt destruction on the human species.<p>Decide not to kill, and you need not kill.  For every $billion bomber, there could have been 1,000 solutions to the distrust and hatred between those who do not understand each other, sufficiently well enough, to acknowledge the commonality of life, shared.  Put the bomber pilot in the middle of the village, and soon enough he&#x27;ll be grateful for the company of those humans with whom he must drink tea, or perish.<p>The <i>only</i> reason that the American people have allowed their nation to be subjugated by murders, criminals, the provably insane, is that they (the American people) simply cannot take responsibility - for themselves, nor for others.  The idea that American military power is a projection of the willingness to &#x27;do good for others&#x27; is an utterly banal fallacy; American military might can only be projected when those who can stop it are driven into an apathy derived from near-total irresponsibility for the results: for the death, for the murder, for the total lack of justice, for the dire export of utter prejudice, and ultimately - hatred.<p>The budget was allocated on death.  It was not spent on life.  There are far more potent ways to deliver continued life by those, the living, here and now, than to predict future conflict &#x27;is necessary and natural&#x27;.

This means code duplication to call the relevant method on each separate class.<p>We could relate them all via an interface, instead of inheritance; now we can store IEntity or whatever. We will soon discover three needs that are awkward to address:<p>1. Whenever we want to add some new method (say `fall`), we must go back and implement it separately in each class.<p>2. Different classes will want to share implementations. For example, both Characters and Pickups bounce on fall.<p>3. Some classes will want to specialize an implementation to do more. Characters bounce on fall, but also take damage.<p>In practice you may end up with both: an interface that your engine talks to, but also a common base class that provides sane defaults.<p>So while interfaces allow uniform interactions with disparate classes, inheritance provides that and also the ability to share and specialize the implementations.

Are the studies it analyzes picked with a bias? For example, if you&#x27;re looking for meta-analyses of the effects of gun control on crime, and one was published by the National Rifle Association and the other came from the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, then you might as well just throw up your hands and go home, because each will probably have suspiciously convenient criteria for what constitutes a reasonable study worthy of inclusion in their meta-analysis.<p>2. Do the studies themselves suffer from publication bias? A meta-analysis purporting to show a positive effect should arouse some suspicion, because negative results often simply don&#x27;t get published, and can not be included in the meta-analysis due to their nonexistence.<p>3. Are the methods of analysis reasonable? There are a horrifying number of ways to pull positive results out of random noise through poor application of statistics.<p>In this particular case, the authors don&#x27;t seem to have an axe to grind, their result is negative, and their analysis is very straightforward.",1404677784

10483,comment,10102,10102,0,0,alive88,,,"important post with some meat to follow up.<p>Next Gen Search is exciting to think about.\nPervasive - I personally want to degadgetize and surround myself with inexpensive, pervasive technology. (Why isn't bluetooth inexpensive?)\nCollaboration - If you listen to MS talk, they are significantly ahead in collaborative technologies. I can't speak to that, but would personally like a movement toward open document formats.\nOpenID - why are they important? I should do more reading, I might not understand the scope of that project.\nweb 2.0 is bubblific. good luck to those hoping to make a quick buck. I wish better luck to those that aspire to create value, change computing and create sustainable business models.",1176057883

That pretty much sums up the web 2.0. Sure it's not another dot-com bust but it still not a long-term thing. Only the biggies can survive while the niches will eventually died.",1176057792

I've outsourced to people in China but I need to have someone local who can take care of the small stuff. <p>It just seems that if I find somebody I'll just be telling them what to do while I sit and watch them code...<p>How do you deal with this?

10478,comment,10446,10446,0,0,microsoftx,,,"what he actually means is that windows is Intuitive enough for even a grandma to use.  That in my opinion is a tremendous compliment.  <p>Ask yourself this :  Can a grandma install Debian?  Is a grandma interested in setting herself apart from the masses with a trendy powerbook?  No and No.  A grandma only wants something that works well.  Like 99.999% of the world's population.<p>People want what is easy and intuitive.  Geeks, hackers and trendy insecure people revel in the obscure and fashionable (Linux and Macs).\n  ",1176057305
10477,comment,10477,9770,0,0,alive88,,,"Why have you chosen Death as your metaphor?<p>We should pay some credence to what Microsoft has done to computing. I think they have built industry leading applications and provided (in some cases) some vision for development. Hands down they once owned computing.<p>Certainly the business model allowed them to become very rich and powerful. Knowing what we know now - maybe we shouldn't have let it happen.<p>Does your article simply state, the industry has changed? Why is Google more important now than Microsoft?<p>Collaborative documents and its respective monetization - who are the leaders? Monetization and sustainability seem to me to be king.<p>What is important about your article? Doesn't Microsoft continue to be profitable, sustainable, and offer value to its customers? Is there something important about a loss of their lock (except the obvious)? Is there a social statement there?<p>How does this translate to me as a user, a developer, a business person?",1176057051

However, requiring Vista for DX10 will push many to looking for alternatives.  Alas, the alternative seems to be the console currently.  While games is may ""fun"", its still the main driver of PC hardware development.  3D cards for games have long since subsumed CAD cards.\n",1176056565

I feel it's often a neglected part in my opinion as I'm so used to programming the back end of web apps. Yet I feel that a really good UI will make a difference with your customers. ",1176056233

Did you see the list of startups at the end of the article in the ""Yscraper""?  pg had an essay on this PR placement.  I wonder which firm handles Y's PR.<p>After justin.tv has gone bust, its value will have been how much attention YC has received because of it.  Kind of like  a loss-leader for YC's stable of startups.<p><p>",1176055782

I feel that his time in the wilderness helped him grow in ways that would not have been possible if he had stayed safely ensconced at Apple.<p>Instead of being at a hugely successful company like Apple, he spent 12 years focused on the challenges at NeXT and Pixar. And the challenges at NeXT were significant. Both companies brought him into contact with very different customer bases. For example, NeXT had a number of major investment banks as big clients. (Granted, Jobs would have had contact with them as CEO of Apple, but as <i>their</i> customer, which is rather different.)<p>\n",1176055704

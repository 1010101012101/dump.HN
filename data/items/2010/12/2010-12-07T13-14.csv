The paragraph ""Like, I'm uncertain if he's saying..."" neither of those summaries were what I was saying. I re-read the article twice to see if I was mis-stating something that made it sound how you described it and I couldn't see it... let me know if I missed something. It sounded to me like you saw ""drug use"" and ""bad"" in the same article and personalized the entire thing into an attack against you and ""your favorite people"" -- that's not what the article is about.<p>The article points out how people chase happiness with easily accessible things; sometimes unhealthy things.<p>I was looking at human behavior regarding over-eating highly satiating foods to quickly and easily compensate for unhappiness as an indicator that if we readily provide mechanism for even <i>higher</i> happiness boosts (assuming there weren't the stigma there is now around drugs) a good majority of people would likely use it.<p>No where in the article did I comment on recreational use. The entire article was about ABUSE.<p>From your closing paragraph, it sounded like you were talking about people using Ayahuasca/Peyote/LSD/whatever to gain moments of total clarity and shut off the mind. I think there are likely huge, legit benefits to these types of practices, but that isn't what I was talking about.<p>Just like I wasn't saying that <i>anyone</i> that eats fastfood should be ashamed of themselves and are lesser people.<p>I wrote an article about people's tendency to abuse substances to make themselves feel happy in a fast-paced world where we can't all sit on mountain tops and think. In that world, I think it's CAN BE dangerous to a large majority of people to have easy access to destructive things that make them feel happy that they might abuse.<p>Again, I am not denouncing ""drug users"" as lesser humans.

Easy-peasy. I then copy-paste the number. I hit return enough times to get to the main window of the software. I use the software. If I use the software an awful lot - say more than once a week - my own guilt will start to hit me, and I'll pay for it - perhaps more than they ask, if the option is available.<p>Notice the part where I said ""hit return enough times to get to the main window of the software"". Pirates don't give a shit about the developers. If they did, they'd pay for the software in the first place. Furthermore, by the time anyone reads that guilt-trip paragraph, the decision has already been made to pirate the app, and all it takes is for me to hit return, and hey presto, no more guilt-tripping.

A great programmer can learn a language faster than an average programmer can become a great programmer. The great programmer could be reasonably productive with Java after two weeks, but an average programmer is unlikely to improve their problem solving skills, or their ability to cleanly structure large programs after the same period of time.<p>* Feel free to replace 'Java' and 'Python' with any two languages within the same paradigm. I don't mean to pick on Java as a language.<p><i></i>2)<i></i> In the article he's ignoring many advantages that smaller languages have going for them:<p>- Much, much higher signal-to-noise ratio when hiring: The people who currently know Scala or Haskell learnt it because they love to program – they sure as hell didn't learn them to land a job. You can't say the same about Java, C# or PHP.<p>- You may make your company more attractive to the best developers: A company advertising for work in Java sounds very average (and a place to work for pointy-haired bosses). It will have to work a lot harder to stand out from the crowd. A company sounds interesting if it uses interesting languages.<p>- Great programmers will usually prefer to work with languages they are passionate about.<p>- Great programmers like working with other great programmers. I can assume I'm working with better programmers when joining a Scala team than a Java team. When hiring, you have to work harder to convince me you're good if you are a Java team.<p>- If you only hire great programmers, you can have smaller teams: ie, you don't actually need to hire as many programmers.<p>- And, of course, it ignores whether these languages may be more productive to work in.",1291728868

1978942,comment,1978675,1978765,0,0,pygy_,,,"I don't think so, low dose aspirin has little effect on inflammation.<p>Aspirin (ASA)is special WRT NSAID, in that it inhibits the Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes irreversibly.<p>COX are a family of enzymes that transform arachidonic acid to various inflamatory mediators called the prostaoids (comprising prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes). There are two subtypes, present in different tissues, but since ASA inhibits both kinds.<p>Platelets contain COX and uses it produce Thromoxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet activator. Since platelets don't have a nucleus, the effect inhibitory effect is permanent in them. New platelets have to be produced in order to restore a normal clotting activity. Since the platelet have an half life of more than a week, the effect is long lasting.<p>Other cells can synthesize COX as needed. Low dose aspirin has thus little effect on them. You need a much higher dose to get a clinically noticeable anti-inflamatory response.<p>In blood vessels, activated platelets use COX to synthesize Thromoxane  A2 (TXA). TXA further promotes vasoconstriction,  platelet activation and aggregation, leading to the formation of a blood clot [1].<p>On the other hand, endothelial cells (the inner layer of blood vessels) use COX to synthesize a prostaglandin (PGI2), which antagonizes TXA (vasodilatation, platelet inhibition).<p>ASA disrupts the TXA2/PGI2 equilibrium in favor of PGI2, inhibiting platelet activation.<p>Other NSAID also have an anti-aggregation activity, but it is far more short lived, and requires anti-inflammatory doses to do so.<p>That said, I can't prove that a chronic, subclinical anti-inflammatory effect isn't at play here too.<p>EDIT:<p>A Google scholar search confirms that TXA2 is involved in carcinogenesis [2-3].<p>--<p>[1] Such a clot is fragile. It is then stabilized by the coagulation process: the irreversible binding of fibrinogen into a fibrine mesh.<p>[2] <a href=""http://scholar.google.be/scholar?hl=nl&q=pgi2+neoplasm&btnG=Zoeken&lr=&as_ylo=&as_vis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.be/scholar?hl=nl&q=pgi2+neoplasm&#...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://scholar.google.be/scholar?hl=nl&q=txa2+neoplasm&btnG=Zoeken&lr=&as_ylo=&as_vis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.be/scholar?hl=nl&q=txa2+neoplasm&#...</a>",1291728239

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zkC9IMQmYA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zkC9IMQmYA</a>
It's an hour long, but I highly recommend it.<p>There was an incredible documentary, which you can probably find online, called ""Doctors in the Death Zone"" which followed a team of doctors studying the effects of altitude on themselves as they attempted Everest.  There's some pretty horrific footage of a team they encounter along the way watching their companion, in obvious distress, drunkenly attempt to reach their position, while they just wait.<p>Lastly, this talk from TEDMed is by the only doctor on Everest during the 1996 disaster, and it's both a great depiction of the main route, and a frightening reminder of just how dangerous it still is up there despite the number of summits and knowledge of the route these days:

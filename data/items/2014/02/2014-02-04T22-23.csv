Microsoft has been a traditional technology company but increasingly, they are getting trounced on the consumer side because they never had to build up a competency due to their incumbency.<p>Microsoft is very good at long term support platforms. They have clearly articulated how long they will support each of their iteration of OS, and software packages. These work extremely well in the enterprise space. Moving a lot of their disparate services into long term support - e.g. skydrive makes good sense.<p>If they can now do the same for their software platforms and provide long term support for how to write long lived applications that will run well on the ARM and x86 platforms, we should start seeing some consolidation in the APIs again.",1391554417

One of these involved, you guessed it, a spreadsheet (we used a number of other development tools for much of our work), in this case Excel.  Again, numerous errors which substantively changed the outcome of the analysis.  One of the walkthrough leader&#x27;s observations was that you could replace all of the in-cell coding with a VBA macro making debugging far easier (all the code and data are separated and in one place each).<p>The particular analyst whose project this was:  he insisted to the very end that this &quot;wasn&#x27;t a program&quot; and he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a programmer&quot; and that the walkthrough didn&#x27;t apply to his situation.  Despite the errors found and corrections made.<p>At the time (mid 1990s) the walkthrough lead turned up a paper from a researcher in Hawaii on the topic.  I&#x27;m not certain it was Raymond Panko, but his 2008 paper (a revise of a 1998 work) discusses the matter in depth:<p><a href=""http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm</a>",1391554311

It&#x27;s not exactly pushed here, either, but it&#x27;s not identified and discarded.<p>There&#x27;s a price point where customers will be feeling pained and possibly taken advantage of, but still recognize the value of the product to them is such that they will still pay.  This is not a sweet spot, I think; it&#x27;s an opportunity for your competitors.<p>Hustling to add value instead of cutting prices is a good point, but &quot;how do we change our product to add more value to our customers?&quot; is a non-trivial question, though.  The default gut responses are usually wrong, and end up increasing value to some customers at a cost to others; more features but severely increased complexity; sometimes broadening the potential target market at the cost of lower value (or a steeper learning curve) for the current user base.<p>Finally: customers even in a fairly narrow niche are diverse.  You may settle on pricing that works great for healthy businesses, but which will force struggling businesses to reluctantly forgo your service, even when they need it the most.<p>A business relationship is a relationship between people or groups thereof, in the end, even if a numbers game is involved to maintain business health.",1391554217

Before that Apple had been stabbing wildly in the dark for a solution to their outdated OS, with a bunch of failed efforts at a rewrite. Yes, they updated the old MacOS a couple of times, which needed to happen, but as soon as OSX was ready for prime timee, they made the switch.<p>iOS is to some extent based on the same internals as OSX, but even if it were a completely different architecture, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s actually a good example of Apple&#x27;s focus.

No fancy lawyering needed.&quot;  In spite of the fact that is &quot;blatantly illegal&quot;, they do it, and nothing bad happens.  How can this be?<p>Well, the reason is because &quot;blatantly illegal&quot; is not a magic word that prevents people from doing things.  It&#x27;s not a technical measure that stops you in your tracks.<p>&quot;Illegal&quot; simply means that someone has the option to get a specific legal remedy from you.  And whether that somebody is interested in exercising that remedy or whether the remedy is very good are completely different questions.<p>It is &quot;blatantly illegal&quot; to search your house but that doesn&#x27;t stop the DEA, your ex-girlfriend, or the burglar down the street from doing so.  The only operative question is, &quot;what is the remedy?&quot;  And on this question the constitution is &quot;blatantly&quot; silent.<p>In the illegal search situation legal precedent has decided the remedy is that you cannot use the evidence you collect illegally in court.  This is called the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine.<p>Now maybe you think that remedy is insufficient, that there should be a fine or we should put them in jail.  That is a perfectly reasonable view.  But &quot;this is blatantly illegal under the constitution&quot; is not an argument that competently advances that position for a harsher remedy.  Everybody already agrees that illegal searches are illegal; that is true by definition.  Not everybody agrees about what the remedy should be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree</a>",1391554079

7180744,comment,7180336,7180336,5,0,saurik,,,"OK, so now I&#x27;m really confused. Previous times Taplytics has come up, it has been asked (the first time by me, the second time by someone else) how this company differs from Apptimize. The second time, the answer came back that the focus was on &quot;ease of use&quot;, requiring only a single line of code for setup. This is even mentioned in this TechCrunch article as their key differentiator. However, Apptimize also only requires an almost identical single line of code for setup.<p>Now, Apptimize additionally documents using a line of code to define a test, but that seems to be only if you choose to use their programmatic API: they also have their own similar visual editor that lets you make these changes, and it even works for Android as well. The one difference on this front seems to be that Taplytics also lets you define goals from the visual editor (Apptimize currently requires a line of code for each goal). This is an important difference to the user (primarily because it means the goals can be defined &quot;on the fly&quot;), yet is frankly a pretty minor difference to the implementation.<p>To be clear: I mean to say that from the perspective of the people who implement these two products, if you already have the complex visual interface setup to make arbitrary changes to the view hierarchy, detecting a button click is a no-brainer: it isn&#x27;t a massively different &quot;focus&quot;. (Also, I always want to underscore that if you have a different &quot;focus&quot;, it needs to be something your competitor wouldn&#x27;t also claim: I doubt anyone would claim not to focus on &quot;ease of use&quot; ;P).<p>So, part of the reason that I was curious about these differences is that multiple of my friends either do currently or have in the near past worked for Apptimize (and they have some options or equity or something in that company). When I first saw Taplytics show up on HN, I pasted a link to them, and they seemed to have not heard about this company before: they, like me, learned about it from these recent couple &quot;Show HN&quot; posts that were made.<p>Today, however, I see that Taplytics is a company backed by Y Combinator, apparently W14. Apptimize is also a company backed by Y Combinator, but S13. Taplytics has a much better website (sorry Apptimize ;P), and has the aforementioned &quot;define goals from visual editor&quot; feature. Apptimize supports Android in addition to iOS. Their pricing is described differently, but actually seems to be based on similar fundamentals (Apptimize is trying to get more money out of larger companies, being a key difference).<p>My confusion is thereby: if Y Combinator is backing both of these, why are they competitors (I&#x27;d almost even argue to the point of being slightly deceptive about benefits), and seemingly somewhat unknown to each other? While there is some overlap, there is probably a lot of stuff that doesn&#x27;t overlap (if nothing else, Android support and the website): why does Y Combinator have them separate? If Y Combinator were &quot;just&quot; an investor, then I could see it as &quot;hedging bets&quot;, but I&#x27;ve been under the impression that Y Combinator is more &quot;hands on&quot; with its companies, which to me makes this seem more awkward.<p>Of course, I know that in the past, Y Combinator has backed multiple companies in the same overall space. A great example of this is &quot;travel search&quot;. However, the tools provided by these companies actually were very different: Hipmunk had a gantt chart and agony calculations, Flightfox was about crowd-optimized pricing optimization, Adioso was about flexible destinations and only really supported leisure travel... these were all very different companies with very different markets and very different interfaces. That is not the case here.<p>I can see a couple reasons, but I don&#x27;t really like either of them. 1) Y Combinator wants to aim for multiple buyouts (which seems like a potential conflict of interest with its founders, who might have hoped to be more unique in their space to command a larger end sum). 2) In an uncharted market, it is more important to educate the user that they want this kind of product at all than to want a specific offering, and brand diversity is valuable (but you can simulate that with multiple brands over the same product, the same way that real product companies have always done).<p>Clearly, however, I don&#x27;t know much about Y Combinator&#x27;s internals, while I&#x27;ve invested in a couple companies I don&#x27;t understand the details of being a VC or an incubator, and I only sort of know what is going on even at Apptimize as I&#x27;ve kind of purposely avoided knowing too much (maybe my read on everything going on there is poor, for example). I thereby would be fascinated if someone who knew more about these kinds of issues, or how this kind of situation plays out at Y Combinator, would be willing to provide some insight into these kinds of competitive incubations.",1391553554

In the WIP rewrite you have modules like &quot;plunker.directive.aceEditor&quot; that will contain a mix of directives and services necessary to interact with the ace editor in the Angular world. In this sense, you could say that code is organized by &#x27;feature&#x27; if feature is very narrowly defined.<p>Understanding a body of code under this approach is relatively simple since the modules required by a given module must be listed for Angular&#x27;s DI to work. The required modules&#x27; names correspond directly to the physical location of the code so navigating is pretty simple.<p>That being said, there is still lots of room to improve and Plunker is by no means a &#x27;large project&#x27; (it is made by a team of 1 person).",1391552618

This marks the first renewal for the Washington DC drama, which originally landed at the streaming company with a straight-to-series two-season order. The deal for a third season comes after months of negotiations and ahead of House Of Cards’ second-season debut next week. “Our intent is that the show keep going for sure,” Netflix‘s Ted Sarandos said back in October. “It was a 26-episode commitment. It was not our intent that it just run for two seasons.” House Of Cards has become a signature series for Netflix the way Mad Men has been for AMC. It put the streaming service on the original programming map and opened the door to creators and producers. Netflix’s follow-up series, Hemlock Grove and Orange Is The New Black, both have been renewed for a second season, and Netflix is continuing negotiations for another installment — episodes or movie — of Arrested Development. Netflix’s $100 million commitment to MRC-produced House Of Cards off of a pitch raised eyebrows at the time as one of the biggest gambles in recent TV history, with the streaming giant outbidding a bevvy of TV heavy hitters.

That very week, my company made a complete turn-around.<p>In other words, I created a product that was well adapted for a specific segment of the market.<p>In the context of the linked article, I think the message is that there is an equilibrium between value provided by a service and the price at which people are willing to pay. If your product is worth more to your users than you are charging them, then you have not optimized this equilibrium.<p>Now, IF you are able to offer your service at a cost that is significantly lower than what your target customers are willing to pay, there is a strong likelihood that competition may try and capture some of this margin.<p>This does not at all violate the equilibrium principle because as new, lower-cost providers arrive, the price-point for users will naturally be lowered.",1391551560

Know some narrow segment of businesses well enough to have an idea what problems they&#x27;re facing and how it translates to dollars, or do enough research to learn same.<p>2. Track down people matching that segment and pitch them. Use your existing connections if you have them, make connections or go cold if you don&#x27;t. You will spend enormous effort making new connections either way, so having connections to start with isn&#x27;t the long-term advantage it might seem.<p>Note: this requires sales skills. If that&#x27;s a problem, consulting may not be for you - at least, not as an independent. One of the key selling points of an agency is having the principals deal with much of the lead generation, sales, reputation building, and so forth.<p>But seriously, if you want to start, start. Stop worrying that you&#x27;ll be bad at it at first - because you will be, no longer how long you worry about it. And at the same time, they&#x27;re hiring you because they expect to get value from it.<p>Go out, make a fool of yourself in front of a few prospective clients, learn stuff in so doing, then do a better job pitching the next few.<p>If you&#x27;re half decent at public speaking, see posts by patio11 & bdunn re: throwing events related to the topic you consult on.

7180551,comment,7178231,7179850,2,0,geebee,,,"I agree that it makes a certain amount of sense at the upper level.  My guess is that eliminating the requirement of a 3 year law degree at the state bar level would have almost no effect on yale law school graduates.  Your analogy to management consulting is an apt one - genuinely (top 3) elite MBA programs aren&#x27;t legally required for anything, but they are in demand.  That said, I think you could knock that third year off yale law school with no discernible loss of quality, and in the absence of a government-enforced 7 year educational requirements,  I do think that you would see the emergence of a tier of very elite lawyers who haven&#x27;t done the 3 year JD as well.<p>Another big question is the effect this has on the lower end of the scale.  We&#x27;re talking about the daily grind of law, divorces, child custody cases, drunk driving charges, and so forth.  My guess is that a lot of people dealing with these issues would benefit simply from having access to a highly literate person who can research things for them without getting threatened with charges of &quot;practicing law without a license&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think that these needs are well met by requiring someone to major in (I&#x27;ll go with Obama here) &quot;art history&quot; for four years simply because they have to get a BA before they can go to law school, followed by three years of very expensive graduate education.  A much shorter course in law, with perhaps some apprenticing, might yield lawyers who can afford to charge much less (then again, many of these folks have so little money that there really is no difference between $20 an hour and $700 an hour, they can&#x27;t pay it).<p>I&#x27;ve heard cynics say that state bars are mainly concerned with preventing paralegals from hawking cheap wills in strip malls, providing assistance with immigration forms, that kind of thing.  I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t really know, I&#x27;m not involved in this sort of thing.  I read about a case a while back (I really wish I could give you a link, it was an interesting article) where a judge did issue an injunction against a woman who had a law degree from another country who was providing immigration council in texas.  The judge went out of his way to mention that her work was of high quality, but she clearly hadn&#x27;t done her 4 years of art history + three years of JD, so she wasn&#x27;t allowed to take the bar exam an was ordered to stop (like, you will be imprisoned if you keep offering these services).",1391551322

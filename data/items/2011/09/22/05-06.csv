3025043,comment,3024029,3024265,3,0,beej71,,,"Yes, however, the desired ""lock-in"" is to the tool, which sells, not the Flashplayer.  People are used to developing with Flash Professional and have AS3 codebases, etc.  If Adobe successfully targets HTML5 instead of Flashplayer, these people can (and in all likelihood will choose to) continue to use FlashWhatever Professional and even their AS3 codebases.<p>The player is merely a medium, though by authoring it, Adobe can advance the state of the art more quickly than the browser makers can agree on anything.  This does make Flash Professional a more compelling environment.<p>But let's pretend for a moment that 95% of browsers got feature-coherent on the level of Flash.  Why would Adobe care if the player were ""all browsers"", instead of Flashplayer?<p>Would they care because if they were targeting all browsers, they'd be effectively targeting a level playing field in terms of the base technology?  Would it end up like Dreamweaver, which also targets a common base technology?<p>I'm going to argue ""not necessarily, and in this case, no"".  And the reason is that anyone today can target Flashplayer.  The playing field is already effectively level on Flash.  Tons of software outputs SWFs.  There are even Flash Professional wannabes, but they're not as good as GIMP is compared to Photoshop, and we know where that thread leads.<p>Speaking of that, consider Photoshop.  It is hugely popular in spite of the fact there is zero infrastructure lock-in.  Literally bazillions of programs can view and edit Photoshop-produced files.  It's thriving while Dreamweaver, relatively, stagnates.<p>Dreamweaver's lack of dominance, IMO, is likely related to other factors.  (I'm not sure why, but I don't know any professional web developers that use it.)<p>Iff Adobe could get Flash-quality and quantity on 95% of browsers using HTML/CSS/JS, I'll still bet you a pint they stop work on the player. Chrome 14 just added audio synthesis, so we're getting there!<p>Adobe's not going to stop working on the Flash Professional-style tools, though, even if it is outputting HTML.  People buy Flash Professional for the features it provides both to the designer and for the end result.  No one actually cares if there is a plugin in the middle or not.",1316671162

Within reasonable time, you should be able to do most typical tasks (i.e. within the context of Linux, do things like install new packages from a repo or from source, configure Apache/Nginx/etc., and so on.)<p>Some things are tougher IMO, like setting up sendmail/e-mail related configuration in general, to make sure your e-mails don't bounce. But that brings me to another point that is valid in 2011 -- fortunately you can ""outsource"" many tasks to cloud service providers such as Amazon. Definitely know what goes on under the hood, but don't spend precious time maintaining the infrastructure yourself.<p>If you do hit a point when for some reason the ""cloud"" solution is too pricy or doesn't scale to your needs, you'll likely be having other (good) problems. In other words, don't worry about that until you're successful, and then hire help if so need be.",1316670919

Not gonna happen. There's no jquery.bytesLoaded to the rescue. Even before the web-app has loaded, HTML is struggling to stay in the same game as Flash or native apps. Pre-loading sound files and other assets and relaying the bytes loaded to the user as a progress bar just isn't possible in HTML. You might be able to cook up a half-baked progress loader in JS, but it will suck, I promise.<p>It's obviously true that for SIMPLE things like menus and other interface features, HTML5 is the choice. But when you start getting seriously rich and multimedia heavy, then you need flash or native apps. And I prefer the Flash development and deployment freedom over native app lock-in any day.<p>Flash should be allowed as an optional plugin on iOS devices, simple as that.

They're post office box numbers.<p>A given post office box is a container with a fixed size and a fixed number. You can refer to a post office box using that number. You can also do things like say ""Get me everything from the four post office boxes beginning with post office box 20."" or ""Go to post office box 3, go down two boxes, and get me what's in the post office box there.""<p>Finally, you can write a post office box number down and stick it into a different post office box. Then, to get anything useful, you have to say things like ""Go to post office box 15, open it and read the piece of paper inside, go to the post office box with the same number as the one written on the piece of paper you just read, and get me what's in that box."" You can actually 'chain' requests like these for a long way, with one post office box having a piece of paper with the number of the next post office box written on it. This gets screwy after the third or fourth box.<p>Anyway, the post office is the simplified notion of RAM your OS gives application programs, a given post office box is a RAM location (byte or word), and a post office box number is a pointer.<p>The rest of the article is basically ""You <i>can</i> program carefully enough to make C programs robust."" and that is, in fact, true. I use robust C programs every day, one of them being the Linux kernel.

If you can grok the articles telling you not to shove signup forms into the faces of first-time visitors, it should be obvious why you don't want to demand a code sample in your first correspondence with a candidate. Lots of hiring managers will think this is entirely reasonable (the average candidate quality for a dev job is indeed poor), but that's an expensive filter applied way too early in the pipeline.<p>Also, the graf about health insurance is written evasively. Netflix says ""we give everyone $10k; they can use it to buy one of our plans, or handle it themselves and pocket the difference"". That works. Not having a group plan? That sucks a lot.

5872245,comment,5871541,5872137,12,0,pjbrow,,,"Agree with the second half of this statement - this idea is too cute by half for the courts.  Acts and omissions both have significance under the law, as does the context of acts and omissions.  If the warrant canary convention was considered by the court as context for a statement, it is very likely the court would rule that a statement had been made.  The only way around this would be to have an evidentiary mechanism by which a company can prove that it has no control over the canary.  This gives rise to the old conundrum: it&#x27;s logically impossible to prove a negative (although you might be able to under various burdens of proof like &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; or some such).<p>Edit: Ultimately, legality turns on the statutory language of the provision in the Patriot Act that obligates businesses not to disclose (anyone know what it is?).  The approach as originally proposed by by Steven Schear (<a href=""http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/cypherpunks-lne-archive/message/5869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/cypherpunks-lne-archive/m...</a>) was for the ISP to simply not answer a direct inquiry by a customer about whether or not a warrant has been served.  The advantage of this approach is that it is far harder to provide evidence to the effect that not responding to the question in that context is a statement.  The disadvantage is that a non-response might not provide certainty to the person who asked the question.  Effectively, the more that a clear convention is formed around the &quot;canary mechanism&quot;, the higher the risk that a court would hold conduct in association with the convention in breach of the statutory obligation not to disclose.",1371095998
5872244,comment,5869121,5871876,5,0,Vieira,,,"That kind of thinking adds very few to the discussion. I respect Apple and I know they are a reference in terms of UI/UX. This does not mean however that they are immune to making mistakes. Your argument is, from what I understood, that as they are very good they must have thought of it and if they choose to do it anyway then it must be the best way. I do not agree.<p>Even for the message at the bottom of the screen there was more contrast before when the text was black. In a room it does not matter much but out, in the sun, you can tell the difference. Anyway, even if you read the most recent message most often than others (which is probably true) you often need to read the previous ones for context if the reply arrives some minutes or hours later. If you are out, previously you could read the last two or three messages without problems. No you have to scroll so that the previous message is under focus to be able to read. And what is there to be gained? Isn&#x27;t the fact that older messages appear before the new ones not enough to hint about their order?<p>Again you raise the argument that Apple always knows best and therefore it&#x27;s laughable that I point out such a thing. Of course Apple would never make such a mistake. Just look at both photos and ask yourself which one can you read best. Also look at screen of the (beautiful) weather app and see if you can check your signal or even the time[1].<p>Also do you think that yellow text on a light background is a good idea in terms of readability? Because that&#x27;s the color of the &quot;actionable&quot; elements in the Notes app.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ios7-apps-2.png?w=640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ios7-app...</a>",1371095979

I mean, the USA is a BIG place, and outside the major cities, there are some damn remote areas in the US, where the population density is pretty low, and you could probably hole up out of site for quite some time and rarely even be seen. Look at how long Eric Rudolph stayed hidden in the Appalachians, for example.

If you&#x27;re willing to swing a hammer and can run a mitre-saw and/or rip a piece of plywood on a table-saw, without cutting your hand off, you can probably find a construction job working &quot;under the table&quot;.

From the docs: &quot;An item is the equivalent of an object in object-oriented programming.  It has a complex structure, specific behavior, and operations described by the &#x27;WinFS&#x27; schemas.&quot;<p>So one way to extend an Item type was to create a derived type (i.e. use inheritance.)  WinFS also supported what it called item extensions, which were basically &quot;small objects&quot; that you could associate with existing objects.  They were for things like reminders, which don&#x27;t mean much on their own and could apply to many different Item types.<p>For your scenario, creating a derived type would probably have been the right solution.<p>EDIT: Well, now that I think about it, what if every different music app created its own Song subclass?  So inheritance might not be the right choice.<p>Ahh, that&#x27;s the kind of thing I deeply love thinking about!

Reuters quotes Snowden as saying:<p><i>&quot;I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authority to wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President.&quot;</i><p>Meanwhile, the way his wording sounded to me (and is quoted more often elsewhere) was:<p><i>&quot;I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President if I had a personal email.&quot;</i><p>The differences are the pluralization of <i>authorities</i> and the addition of the conditional-qualifier &quot;if I had a personal email&quot;.<p>Of course people speaking in an unrehearsed manner may mix up tenses, pluralization, and speak with imprecision as they shift between thoughts and chosen emphases. But I suspect those portions of the quote Reuters messed up were significant.<p>First, it sounded to me like &#x27;authorities&#x27; was likely a term-of-art in his intelligence-analyst line of work, meaning specific rule-artifacts in the access system, representing a mix of &#x27;proper credentials&#x27; and &#x27;suitable legal/system authorization&#x27;.<p>After all, NSA defenders have given the impression that even though there is a massive amount of data collected, including on US citizens under no suspicion, it&#x27;s OK because those records sit idle, never looked at unless and until the right conditions are met.<p>I have a hunch those conditions are called &#x27;authorities&#x27;. So when you&#x27;ve got records on individuals A, B, and C, and your algorithms tell you A & B are 51%-plus likely to be US citizens, but C is 55% likely to be a foreigner, well, you can use the longstanding &#x27;authority&#x27; allowing analysts of your grade to do warrantless surveillance of foreigners, to start pulling things up on C, from anywhere and everywhere (including previously-bulk-warehoused call recordings, colloquially &#x27;wiretaps&#x27;).<p>And then when you see that C has been emailing B, that alone, or perhaps the contents of those messages, might be enough to activate another &#x27;authority&#x27; - suspicion, or association, or content-pattern based - which then allows at least a peek into B&#x27;s records. Perhaps that peek confirms B is a foreigner - now the identity is marked that way, and it&#x27;s all wide open. Or maybe the peek shows B to be a citizen... well, now you&#x27;ve got 1 week to ask the FISA court for a warrant. Better read fast! (Open question: if NSA decides after this &#x27;free look&#x27; they have no interest in continued surveillance of target person B, does the warrant for retroactive permission ever get requested? Are there any records or repercussions from the &#x27;free look&#x27;?)<p>Of course, the visibility of some target-records might be over-determined: multiple active &#x27;authorities&#x27; all allow viewing. Others might require some &quot;good at the keyboard&quot; analyst creativity to activate: is there a past-travel, likely-associations, prior-suspicious activity, etc. &#x27;authority&#x27; that could be applied? Still other &#x27;authorities&#x27; might only be available to more senior analysts: maybe targets who are themselves state/federal employees, elected officials, etc. have an <i>extra</i> sheath-of-privacy that prevents easy peeks by junior people using the most simple and elastic &#x27;authorities&#x27;.<p>Which brings us to Snowden&#x27;s other carefully-qualified bombshell: &quot;to even the President if I had a personal email.&quot; Let&#x27;s say person B above is in fact the US President... perhaps using a separate personal email address. (There is of course controversy about officials having separate email accounts, but it&#x27;s almost certainly a rampant practice see especially the recent Petreaus affair and allegations administration officials in the EPA, HHS, or Labor department have used secondary addresses, sometimes under alternate names, for official business or leaking.)<p>Now using one of the myriad of &#x27;authorities&#x27; a skilled analyst can utilize, they can start pulling up warehoused records about B  the President himself  possibly including previously recorded telephone/VOIP discussions linked with the B identity (aka &#x27;wiretaps&#x27;).<p>I wonder, then, were &#x27;a federal judge&#x27; and &#x27;the President&#x27; just vivid hypothetical examples?

1310329,comment,1310091,1310145,0,0,Qz,,,"Web Apps do have advantages over traditional desktop software -- what I'm trying to get at is that we can take what we've learned about web apps, and apply that knowledge to 'traditional' software to get desktop apps that don't suck.  It doesn't have to be about web apps <i>vs</i> desktop apps, or one catching up with the other.  Within a few years I don't think there will even be a concept of desktop vs web apps, not because one killed the other, but because they will have been integrated.<p>> <i>Some browers now automatically populate a home page with your most commonly used apps/sites.</i><p>This is exactly what I mean.  <i>Now?</i>  This could have been done years ago.  Don't even get me started on the bookmarks system (offline and online both).  There are innovative things that can be done with these simple aspects of web interaction that could have been done years back -- it's not like there's some miracle tech that is making new stuff possible.  UI designers as a group (or maybe more fairly, the companies that employ them) have, in my opinion, been inexcusably lazy in regards to pushing forward the computer user experience.",1272704263

Their limitations were already largely thought through at Xerox PARC decades ago, and that's how the mouse and windowing systems were born - they're very good methods of dealing with the limited screen real estate. If anything, there are less limitations on them now. Touch tablets are potentially an area for expansion, but I don't know that I've seen anything that warrants a radical change on the desktop.<p>As for the menial tasks, I do next to no window management - my screens are completely unorganized, but a combination of Expose, alt-tab/tilde, and Quicksilver tend to make that a nonissue.",1272703887

The tagging is nice, but other programs have similar features. Teh spam filtering is nice, but actually there are better spam filters. The only thing I can think of is the integration with google docs and I actually hate that feature. I don't know how they managed it, but opening a pdf with google docs is about 5x slower than downloading the pdf and opening with evince.

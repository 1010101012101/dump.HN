I get enough complaints already about the Google Analytics tracking (and that's after putting it on the bottom of the page to minimize the chance of blocking the page, thus hurting my stats).<p>Everyone is talking about ""pixels,"" but actually giving publishers blocking JS includes.  This means that as a publisher, you're going to have to prioritize the user experience versus tracking, and also prioritize the tracking!  If you put the Comscore JS under the Quantcast JS, then the slower the Quantcast JS returns, the lower your Comscore stats will be (because it gives the user more time to navigate away from the page).

Roughly one of those in ten would attract attention outside of the folks already reading my blog.<p>These days, I blog about a fifth as much or less, but am much smarter about topic selection.

1073488,comment,1073357,1073466,0,0,patio11,,,"I'm not picking on you here: I think one of the reasons this issue gives us fits is that we think about it in terms of ""gaining and sustaining traffic"", which is somewhere in the general vicinity of an actual business goal, but not quite there.  ""Traffic"" is not valuable per se and often people optimize for it in ways which are counterproductive for the business.  For example, if you get featured on TechCrunch, you will certainly get a lot of ""traffic"", but what does that get you, really?  A few dozen comments saying the design of your front page would look better in blue, your VPS chugs under load, and ""didn't Taxi.derm.me already do this last year""?  And then tomorrow they'll have forgotten about you.<p>But people spend <i>insane</i> amounts of time and effort trying to get on TechCrunch, when they could spend that time writing pitches to blogs whose owners will melt to know anyone who is reading them, or writing systems to make pillar content which will be attract qualified, interested prospects for the next <i>decade</i>.<p>And even for those few (arguably) lucky folks who make it onto Techcrunch, they might assume that if getting a big splash ""gains"" traffic then subsequent big splashes are needed to ""sustain"" it, throwing an increasing amount of resources to further pessimize their business to fit the preferences of a narrow, fickle audience who does not spend money on the stuff they have to sell.",1264353476

Lisps have always had a good story there as the first widely used functional language (well, technically most of them are multiparadigm but strongly functional), with a strong mathematical basis (the lambda calculus).  Clojure takes full advantage of this.<p>Apropos of the above, Haskell, the ML family and maybe Erlang were probably the only more popular strongly functional languages prior to Clojure, but for many they are harder to master; Lisps are more straightforward, they are dynamically typed, etc.<p>Basing it on the JVM makes a <i>big</i> difference: for some it provides a warm and fuzzy since Java is so widely accepted and the Java/JVM ecosystem is so big and healthy.  For many this provides an easier path to getting started, and if you want to get real world stuff done quickly, there's all those Java libraries and packages that can easily be directly called from Clojure and that can call Clojure.<p>(Actually, running on the JVM makes it easy for pretty much everyone to get started on most any platform, just download the .jar file and run it in the JVM that most likely is already installed on your system.)<p>Rich Hickey has made a <i>lot</i> of good choices in designing the language and its core libraries; it ""feels"" like a good fusion of Scheme and Common Lisp, richer than the former and not at all crufty or impossibly massive like the latter.<p>The community is <i>very</i> functional, so to speak ^_^.

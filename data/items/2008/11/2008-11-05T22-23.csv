355121,comment,355075,355107,0,0,palish,,,"Certainly.  Rumor has it that Einstein had at least one or two mistresses that he would visit from time to time.  Those visits probably did nothing to improve his personal life, or benefit him in any way except emotionally (and even then, only in the short term; his jaunts probably had long-term emotional consequences).  Therefore, those actions were probably illogical.<p>However, setting that aside for one moment... Imagine someone who most people would classify as ""developmentally disabled"".  (I don't like over-general labels, but it is a relatively specific one in this case.)  Now, the million-dollar question is: would it ever be possible for that person to solve a problem of the magnitude Einstein has solved?<p>It <i>seems</i> like the answer is no.",1225925871

I didn't take the post to mean, ""He was an inner city gangster and he became president, so put down your guns and drugs and go run for state senate!!!111!!""<p>I took it to mean exactly what he said, that Obama being elected president is a great way to show a kid that they <i>can</i> grow up to be anything they want, and that America <i>won't</i> limit them based on the color of their skin or whether they grew up without the benefits of two wealthy, married, parents and a private school education (because Obama clearly does have much darker skin than any of our prior presidents, though we have had a few presidents with black folks in their family tree, even if it doesn't get talked about much).  He <i>is</i> ""black"" by the definition that matters in this context: The definition that racists follow, since racism is the barrier we're talking about.

355100,comment,355003,355003,0,0,Brushfire,,,"Let me preface this by saying I've had similar problems in other parts of the country when hiring developers. Below is just a loose collection of thoughts/ideas on the topic.<p>Your job post is probably only halfway there in attracting totally awesome people. You dont make the job sound AWESOME.<p>1 - There are no specifics mentioned regarding compensation. Although this is the standard elsewhere in the world, and for non-hacking jobs, we had much more success just being completely upfront with people about what we were offering and why, including stock/healthcare/benefits. Hackers are generally pretty no-nonsense people when it comes to $$, and in your area (like ours) your best chance of getting someone is stealing them from another software job.<p>Generally people don't list exact salary because either (A) they dont want to tell so that they can feel you out (what was your salary at your last job bullshit) or (B) its actually under market pay. If you are SURE you are over market average, say so with actual numbers. If you aren't, then don't expect to find someone quickly.<p>2 - The remote worker is a good idea if your team can handle it and your requirements don't change rapidly. Regardless, to everyone saying 'remote is the way to go' this is very hard to find and hard to make work for most teams. It shouldn't be, but it is.<p>3 - Pictures actually do a lot of good in attracting good talent. Is your office neat? or boring. Are the desks awesome? or crappy. Are the monitors big? Chairs Comfortable? People Friendly looking? Pictures answer all of these questions, hopefully to your benefit!<p>4 - You might start by trying to find someone who wants to do part-time or contract work, but who is local. They may already have a job, but want some extra cash. You wont get to place the same time or job constraints on them, but you may get better work. And if you really like them, you'll be in a better place after 2-3 months to really make them an offer they cant resist.<p>5 - Startups are tricky in other parts of the country than CA and MA. If someone quits their job to work for you, they may have to find another in 6 months. This means you wont get many people to move to your job from a national job circuit. In addition, it also makes it hard to steal someone from a bigger/existing software job. This is something you will either have to overcome by showing them how well funded you are (VC?), or that you are already making $$ (are you?).<p>Anyways, hope this helps, good luck. At one point we waited 9 months to find the right developer, and it really paid off, but the waiting sucks balls.",1225924929

It need only have most, and the prevailing arguments.<p>Has anyone mentioned what such 'major mechanisms' and global temperature trends Timothy Ball is talking about? It is at least fair to ask <i>what</i> physical effects or <i>which</i> models they're referring to. The climate models that, for example, the IPCC works with, are all out in the open. Here's what the radiative forcing factors are: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Radiative-forcings.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Radiative-forcings.svg</a><p>Crichton talks about the over-reliance on 'models' to understand the climate. What else are we supposed to do? Science relies on models, without which we can't predict anything. If we agree that high levels of global warming are bad, then prudence dictates that we look into seeing <i>if</i> it might actually happen, <i>why</i>, and how we might prevent it. It's too highly nonlinear to prove out analytically: computer models, carefully constructed, and verified piecemeal by experiment, are the best we can do. The physics is easy to understand: carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, letting visible light in, and reflecting infrared back. This warms the earth. I haven't yet heard a single plausible possibility floated for why carbon dioxide wouldn't increase temperatures. It is only fair to ask these skeptics, who make bolder claims than we, that they argue using scientific tools that are as good, or better. Claiming that ""Believe it or not, Global Warming is not due to human contribution of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). This in fact is the greatest deception in the history of science,"" and then pointing towards our over-reliance on computer models, simply won't do.<p>Here are sourced statements from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ball</a> that Tim Ball has made. They are false claims!<p>""Water vapor is effectively ignored in the computer models. Yes, that's right. The climate models used as the basis for the entire global warming argument do not include the effect of clouds.""[6] -- This is trivially shown to be false if you look at the climate models in use.
""Since 1940 and from 1940 until 1980, even the surface record shows cooling. The argument is that there has been warming since then but, in fact, almost all of that is due to what is called the “urban heat island” effect – that is, that the weather stations are around the edge of cities and the cities expanded out and distorted the record.""[7] -- meteorological surveys include regularly sampled far flung regions, and the weather on the entire planet is observed by satellites on the infrared spectrum.",1225924195

We've also done a fair amount of reading from studies about the usage of laptops/tablets in the classroom and read opinion articles like these to observe the issues.<p>In your case, you're one of the students who has already made that digital jump over and has all the gear you need.  You, being the geek that I'll assume you are (-don't take that as an insult, I am too...), got these tools and self taught them and are self disciplined in their usage.  However, most students and most schools don't have this.<p>While my venture is specifically interested in K12, we are interested in college too.  For most classes (a ceramics class could be an exception), you have your basic necessities and then some additional tools you could be using.  That's what we're focused on in our works, is creating the basics in a way that can be easily and seamlessly used in classes so that every student has access to the tools and resources they need, and with a certain degree of personalization to fit the different needs of different people.",1225922871

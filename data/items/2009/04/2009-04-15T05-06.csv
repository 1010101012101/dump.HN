563047,comment,562834,562834,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This seems really susceptible to noise.  It makes perfect sense that people who smile a lot tend to have a happier disposition, which makes them easier to get along with, which makes them more likely to stay married.  However, plenty of people are unhappy in school for reasons that have nothing to do with having a genetically cheery personality.  It could be, oh, the getting beat up, and being forced to do mindless work, and listening to teachers who are dumber than you, and waking up at godawful hours.<p>People often change <i>a lot</i> when they go off to college and start working.  I was just having dinner with a coworker who's one of the most talkative people I know.  Apparently, she <i>never</i> talked for the first 18 years of her life, and only rarely for the next 4.  Happiness may have a strong genetic component, but that's not saying that the environment doesn't matter <i>at all</i>.",1239775035

Given time, I agree.<p>I can say that there is a very open and supportive start-up culture here (Boulder & Denver metro). Tech Meetups and LUG groups are pretty active; the new-tech group based in Boulder routinely overfills 300-seat auditoriums and is expanding to handle the traffic.

If it is any consolation, no recommendation service usually does.<p>Here is the problem: recommendation engines usually try to match common variables between the movie you like and other movies - kudos to nanocrowd for doing this at a more sophisticated level than ""it has the same actor in it"" - but most fail to weigh heavily enough the quality of the movie (Netflix is notorious bad at this). More to the point, the movies that people really love have some personal connection with them that I am not sure  is open to crowdsourcing.<p>I will now give you an example: I love the movie Pitch Black. Why? Yes, there's the action/horror tension, and the fabulous spaceship crash, and the charismatic lead - but the reason I <i>love</i> that movie is because of its kernel which is a highly moral tale about the salvation of caring for someone other than yourself, and of the powerful human need to seek redemption.<p>Now I am not going to reproduce this here, but go put in Pitch Black in nanocrowd and you will see the problem: it focuses on the superficial properties of the plot, and none of the movies recommended come even close.<p>What is the closest movie in feel that I have seen? The Station Agent. Now the day I type in ""Pitch Black"" in a recommendation and get back ""The Station Agent"" is the day I am going to sell all my wordly goods to buy stock in that company.<p>(That said it is safe to say most people aren't as picky as me, and I am sure you can find some success with this  model especially if you harness it to something people visit a lot anyway, like IMDB or Netflix).",1239774423

Most of them are hard-science degrees whereas CS is at least partially a liberal art. (The exceptions to this where CS-related degrees are issued as BSs are most notably issued at the most well-regarded colleges for CS, as far as I know.)<p>Although the average CS program is pretty terrible, the underlying differentiating factor is that doing practical CS work is cheap and easy (the same thing that motivated internet entrepreneurship); additionally a large part of the literature is directed at 'lay practitioners'. Doing (advanced) physics or chemistry is neither cheap nor easy, and it's pretty hard (impossible, AFAIK) to do pure professional mathematics outside an academic setting.",1239774105

563028,comment,562834,562834,0,0,mcslee,,,"I'm surprised the general response here is so negative. Besides the fact that it's obvious, research does in fact confirm that happier people smile more. And the average high school student is probably not focused on being cynical and grumpy whilst having his/her picture taken (though perhaps cultural norms around pictures have changed over the past decades).<p>Anyways, couple the happiness-smiling connection with a few other facts about human psychology, and this makes a lot of sense. (1) Emotional states in humans are contagious. We naturally tend to empathize with one and other, laugh together, and cry together. (2) We also naturally tend to mimic physical gestures made by people we are interacting with, often subconsciously. (3) Facial expressions actually influence our emotional state. Being happy makes us smile, but also <i>smiling actually makes us happier.</i><p>It doesn't seem much of a leap from there that happiness would correlate inversely with divorce. In my take, this article is just reaffirming that naturally happy people are less likely to divorce.<p>Here's another interesting article about the contagiousness of happiness:

And say that being a migraine sufferer puts a terrible strain on your marriage (look, it's just an example) and so you are more likely to divorce. Now if you look for the divorce rate of people who frown, it will be much higher than that of people who smile.

562998,comment,562157,562157,0,0,ktharavaad,,,"1. Establish an independent niche in the market as early in your startup as possible. Avoid the web2.0 startup trap of following hype implementing ideas that are already popular and profitable. Of course social networks are helpful, but just-another-social-network can't form the basis of your startup<p>2. Be problem-oriented, not technology-oriented. Use a variety of technology -- whichever are necessary to solve the problems in the market. As shown by twitter, back in the days of ruby&rails popularity and DIY-everything, it would take twitter considerable resources to assemble a new queueing queuing system which sucks, when existing better alternatives existed. lest the founder be seduced into implementing another overdone component/api in a brand new web2.0/meta-meta-programming language. It is also painful to hear one startup after another say that ""we are based on ruby and rails"", as if this makes them cooler. While this may interest potential  non-technical investors who judge the value of startups by the amount of the lattest technology jargons founders put into their keynote/powerpoints, its simply a waste of resources for the company in the long run. Remember, technology comes and goes, but the underlying need of the market should be the focus of the startup. It is depressing to go to conferences where the same old market problems are tackled; more “cutting edge” techniques, presented by people enamored of the techniques rather than the market problems. If technology is so costly, in terms of equipment, learning time, and other resources, how does one avoid the trap of becoming technique oriented? The answer: use what is already out there, leverage open source and solve real problems in the market.<p>3. Think beyond the next hype, or even the next round of investing. Take the long view; look at the big picture. In other words, bite off a piece of question that may take a month, or even a year to answer. There is a major difference between the scientist that wonders how to break the question into appropriate sized grant proposals, and one who wonders how to expand the question into a grant proposal. Furthermore, commit yourself to your question; given the time and energy it takes to answer an appropriate sized research question, pursuing a series of unrelated research questions in parallel rather than in series is often a sign of dilettantism.<p>4. If you do developed a new technology in your startup, keep your eyes open for other applications of your findings. On the other hand, if you heavily leverage an existing technology, keep your eyes on underlying technology/framework. Often, the distinction between technology and application is arbitrary and fluid.<p>5. When conducting market resource, don’t accept data or results at their face value. Keep plugging away at the problem until the answers or results make sense or satisfy you in terms of an overall schema. Most importantly, don’t accept other company's solutions (37 signals?); every startup is different.<p>6. Expect the unexpected. Many great ideas are discarded because a startup initially “didn’t work”. However, good execution should provide positive results regardless of the idea involved. Often a ""good idea"" and a ""bad idea"" is only differentiated by the execution.<p>7. Don’t expect quick success in a startup; expect more hardship, sacrifices, sweat, blood and tears. Paul Graham used to tell us that a good startup often require years of work to build up. Perhaps non-entrepreneurs find this aspect of startups strangely frustrating. However, the lack of dedication and handwork differentiate the success and failures<p>8. Never stop asking for user feedback. User feedback are the stock-in-trade of startups. The corollary of this suggestion is “never make assumptions.” Of course, assumptions are a necessary part of application design, but on an everyday practical level, and in terms of application workflow, assumptions can be disastrous. Many times I’ve located workflow bugs and inefficiencies in a startup's application workflow, because unlike them, I did not assume that a user could not “go there” or “do that”.<p>9. Choose a problem that excites you. It should excite you so much that you can’t sleep. It should excite you so much that when someone asks you the time, you blurt out your 30 second elevator pitch.<p>10. Strive for elegance and cleanliness in yoru code. The elegance of a codebase is in the quality of the thinking and the cleverness of the approach to solving the market's problem, not in the complexity of the design or the sophistication of the technology. Often, the most elegant code are simple, short attacks at the heart of the problem. Study famous open source code in your application domain and appreciate the logic and thought that went into it. All too often startups nowadays ignore existing codebase because it isn’t available on github, or dismiss it for using old-fashioned techniques. There is much wisdom and cleverness in some of those old projects. Reading them, learning from them, and citing them, is what real programmers do.",1239772860

The most important implication of this is that I've already seen everything it recommends (but that at least means that the recommendation algorithm is on target).<p>Making the user click on a nanogenre after entering a movie is unnecessary - you could show at least a partial list of all of them instead (and maybe show more of a particular list if you click on it).<p>Overall, I like clerkdogs better, mainly due to the wider selection.",1239772717

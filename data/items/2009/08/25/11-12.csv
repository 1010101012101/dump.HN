784636,comment,784466,784466,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't know about peak oil, but the style of that article reeks of revisionism. The classic approach: find some cherry picked quotes from the opposition that are obviously silly but happen to be actually quite irrelevant, and debunk them (in this case the stuff about water in the oil fields). I'd like more hard facts to make up my mind.",1251201451
784635,comment,784479,784622,0,0,smanek,,,"Yeah, Java doesn't do multimethods (i.e., method dispatch based on runtime argument types).<p>If Class X has two methods:<p><pre><code>  void foo(Object i);\n  void foo(Integer i);\n</code></pre>\nthen:<p><pre><code>  Object test = new Integer(4);\n  X x = new X();\n  x.foo(test);\n</code></pre>\nwill invoke 'void foo(Object o);' based on the compile time type of test.<p>Java does do dispatch based on the runtime type of X - but it is quite limiting once you are used to having proper multiple dispatch at your disposal.<p>(caveat: not in front of a javac - this is from memory).",1251201356

784628,comment,784479,784604,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Complexity can sometimes be a perspective thing.  I recall a discussion at one point with a co-worker were we were each arguing that the other persons approach to a particular problem was more complex.  After much contemplation I was able to see both perspectives.<p>Also with some problems there seems to be a conservation of complexity notion.   It's inherent in the system and depends on where you push it.<p>For the book, you might want to check out <i>Large-Scale C++ Software Design</i>.  Unfortunately it's at home so I can't crack it open and double check, but it seemed full of suggestions on structuring code and layout a large software project.",1251200581

784619,comment,784528,784528,0,0,tjogin,,,"I don't know, it seems this is more a list of products that didn't happen to strike the writer's fancy — rather than <i>canonical</i> failures. Whether something is a success or failure is not a whole lot about personal opinion — it's about observable, measurable fact.<p>For instance, the white earbuds, whatever you may think of them — had a pretty important role in popularizing the iPod, as they stood out from the rest. iPod users, in spite of having the actual devices hidden in their pockets, could be identified from afar (among users of other unidentifiable brands of mp3 players). Look at the iPod commercials with the black silhouette people wearing white earbuds. I'd say Apple's earbuds, regardless of audio quality, has been a phenomenal success. They're not failures by any stretch of the imagination. You may think they suck, and you may be right, but they're not a failure.<p>About the same thing goes for iTunes. You may think it suck, and you might be right. But it's not a failure. It is a resounding success. iTunes has become the leader in music organization (second only to manual ""organization"" in ad-hoc folders). iTunes has been essential to making the organization, synchronization and purchasing of music an overall smooth experience.<p>While I agree with most of the points brought forth; iTunes is becoming increasingly bloated, being responsible for many things that has absolutely nothing to do with music — it maintaining that role has also made it easier for users already familiar with iTunes to start buying apps for the iPhone, synchronizing their calendar and contacts, etc.<p>I agree iTunes needs a bit of an overhaul, everything not related to music organization should be moved into separate apps dedicated to just doing that. So yeah, iTunes sucks. But it is not a failure — it is an enormous success.<p>Having the opinion that something sucks does not magically make it a failure.",1251200252

The US doesn't protect all speech and allows some things to be banned. Cases like this should fall under nonprotected speech. The harm that can done time innocent person without any due process of a fair legal trial and with no effective ability to argue your case <i>far</i> outweighs the harm to a newspaper in banning them mentioning the name. You should be allowed report all the rest of the details of this horrific crime, of course, but you should not be legally allowed to identify the accused unless it was very much in the public interest (e.g. if it was a politician who did it).",1355583495

What it means is, for example, that perhaps the evolution of life, or multi-cellular life, or animal life, or intelligent life, etc - is so unlikely that even though there are trillions of trillions of attempts, those that succeed are so far apart that they will never meet (perhaps thanks to the expansion of the universe, or through the difficulty of travelling across interstellar distances, etc). That's the lucky scenario.<p>The unlucky scenario is that this cliff is after where we are now. Perhaps there are millions of intelligent species even in just the Milky Way, but perhaps intelligent life is doomed to self-destroy eventually (for example by reaching a Singularity, building a Dyson sphere, and then basically disappearing up its own arse; or perhaps by ending in some kind of nuclear war, or biological wipeout after someone's biology experiment goes horribly wrong, etc).<p>That latter scenario would mean that we're likely to kill ourselves before <i>we</i> get to the stars.<p>I hope for the first scenario.<p>Edit: Of course, as pixl97 points out, perhaps Fermi's paradox is an incorrect observation, and the aliens are already here, they're just being really cautious about being observed.",1355583488

I know how all of the technologies that Kurzweil is banking on work at a very low level and I call bullshit that this is ever going to happen. It would require a type of software that simply does not exist yet, something akin to a self-programming software, and we are so far away from that that it might as well be cold fusion.<p>I think it's much more valid to call the ""singularity"" the point in time when technological expansion started occurring at an exponential rate. Thus I would put the singularity at about 200 years in the past, right around the time the spinning jenny was invented, and right before the industrial revolution. Now there's a point in time that I can point to and say ""something meaningful happened"". This is complete pie in the sky stuff, and I'm extremely cynical that it's not just something that Kurzweil talks about to sell books and conference tickets.",1355583085

However, it is so generic (you can read usenet news and any kind of e-mail), that it's really a pain to get started. There are terminology confusions (i.e. you need several hacks to have a gmail-like inbox) and overall, it just doesn't <i>feel</i> like g-mail..<p>Also, by starting very specific for our own problem, it's easier to create a meaningful product that solves a real need.

I would suggest you review the footage of the LA bank shootout, to get an idea of what two men with rudimentary tactical training can do. A well trained squad of 4 to 6 can be absolutely devastating and it is why guerrilla warfare is such a hard and gritty fight to endure for a traditional force. It's why we lost to Vietnam, superior firepower cannot compensate for strategical and tactical advantage. The reality is, that the US could be disrupted by as little as 10% of it's population resorting to guerrilla warfare and quite possible loose. That being said, there is still a need for the government to be balanced by fear of the people, Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia is not that far in the rear view mirror, and the evils that lurked in the hearts of those men is not confined to Europe, they walk among all nations and desire the same darkness.

It only means that those are human needs and desires. In case of singularity, there's a real chance that we could do all of this <i>without</i> need for supernatural powers, so it's worth discussing.",1355581415

4925311,comment,4923914,4924852,22,0,dalke,,,"""Predicting that self-driving cars would occur in ten years in the late 90s is pretty extraordinary""<p>There have been predictions of self-driving cars for more than half a century. It's in Disney's ""Magic Highway"" from 1958, for example. There was an episode of Nova from the 1980s showing CMU's work in making a self-driving van.<p>Researching now, Wikipedia claims: ""In 1995, Dickmanns re-engineered autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz took a 1600 km trip from Munich in Bavaria to Copenhagen in Denmark and back, using saccadic computer vision and transputers to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding 175 km/h on the German Autobahn, with a mean time between human interventions of 9 km, or 95% autonomous driving. Again it drove in traffic, executing manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to 158 km without human intervention.""<p>You'll note that 1995 is before ""the late 90s."" It's not much of a jump to think that a working research system of 1995 could be turned into something production ready within 20 years. And you say ""a year or two late"", but how have you decided that something passes the test?<p>For example, Google Glass is the continuation of decades of research in augmented reality displays going back to the 1960s. I read about some of the research in the 1993 Communications of the ACM ""Special issue on computer augmented environments.""<p>Gibson said ""The future is already here  it's just not very evenly distributed."" I look at your statement of batting a thousand and can't help but wonder if that's because Kurzweil was batting a thousand when the books was written. It's no special trick to say that neat research projects of now will be commercial products in a decade or two.<p>Here's the list of 15 predictions for 2009 from ""The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999)"", copied from Wikipedia and with my commentary:<p>* Most books will be read on screens rather than paper -- still hasn't happened. In terms of published books, a Sept. 2012 article says ""The overall growth of 89.1 per cent in digital sales went from from 77m to 145m, while physical book sales fell from 985m to 982m - and 3.8 per cent by volume from 260m to 251m."" I'm using sales as a proxy for reads, and while e-books are generally cheaper than physical ones, there's a huge number of physical used books, and library books, which aren't on this list.<p>* Most text will be created using speech recognition technology. -- way entirely wrong (there's goes your 'batting 1000')<p>* Intelligent roads and driverless cars will be in use, mostly on highways. -- See above. This is little more common now than it was when the prediction was made.<p>* People use personal computers the size of rings, pins, credit cards and books. -- The ""ring"" must surely be an allusion to the JavaRing, which Jakob Nielsen had, and talked about, in 1998, so in that respect, these already existed when Kurzweil made the prediction. Tandy sold pocket computers during the 1980s. These were calculator-sized portable computers smaller than a book, and they even ran BASIC. So this prediction was true when it was made.<p>* Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation. -- Again, this was true when it was made. The JavaRing would do automated identity. The Benefon Esc! was the first ""mobile phone and GPS navigator integrated in one product"", and it came out in late 1999.<p>* Cables are disappearing. Computer peripheries use wireless communication. -- I'm mixed about this. I look around and see several USB cables and power chargers. Few wire their house for ethernet these days, but some do for gigabit. Wi-fi is a great thing, but the term Wi-Fi was ""first used commercially in August 1999"", so it's not like it was an amazing prediction. There are bluetooth mice and other peripherals, but there was also infra-red versions of the same a decade previous.<p>* People can talk to their computer to give commands. -- You mention Siri, but Macs have had built-in speech control since the 1990s, with PlainTalk. Looking now, it was first added in 1993, and is on every OS X installation. So this capability already existed when the prediction was made. That's to say nothing of assistive technologies like Dragon which did supported text commands in the 1990s.<p>* Computer displays built into eyeglasses for augmented reality are used. -- ""are used"" is such a wishy-washy term. Steve Mann has been using wearable computers (the EyeTap) since at least 1981. Originally it was quite large. By the late 1990s it was eyeglasses and a small device on the belt. It's no surprise that in 10 years there would be at least one person - Steve Mann - using a system where the computer was built into the eyeglasses. Which he does. A better prediction would have been ""are used by over 100,000 people.""<p>* Computers can recognize their owner's face from a picture or video. -- What's this supposed to mean? There was computer facial recognition already when the prediction was made.<p>* Three-dimensional chips are commonly used. -- No. Well, perhaps, depending on your definition of ""3D."" Says Wikipedia, ""The semiconductor industry is pursuing this promising technology in many different forms, but it is not yet widely used; consequently, the definition is still somewhat fluid.""<p>* Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space. -- No.<p>* A 1000 dollar pc can perform about a trillion calculations per second. -- This happened. This is also an extension based on Moore's law and so in some sense predicted a decade previous. PS3s came out in 2006 with a peak performance estimated at 2 teraflops, giving the hardware industry several years of buffer to achieve Kurzweil's goal.<p>* There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of ""chaotic"" or complexity theory computing. -- Meh? The late 1990s, early 2000s were a hey-day for that field. Now it's quieted down. I know 'complexity'-based companies in town that went bust after the dot-com collapse cut out their funding.<p>* Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans. -- Was already being done long before then, so I don't know what ""initiated"" means.<p>* Autonomous nanoengineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls. -- Ah-ha-ha-ha! Yes, Drexler's dream of a nanotech world. Hasn't happened. Still a long way from happening.<p>So several of these outright did not happen. Many of the rest were already true when they were made, so weren't really predictions. How do you draw the conclusion that these are impressive for their insight into what the future would bring?",1355581040

If you can't see that it has all the fundamentals of a religion, I'm not sure what else to say.<p>Fundamentals of religion are irrelevant. The difference between singularity and rapture is that the first one - if we'll reach it - will be of human creation. Of our science and technology, not of supermagical powers. We can pretty much see the steps there, even though we haven't executed them all. Maybe it will take 200 years, not 50, but we will get there (unless we blow ourselves up before that).<p>Highlighting similarities between religion and singularity has no more merit than saying that addition is bad because Hitler and Stalin did it.",1355581027

The  Maes-Garreau law, as fun as it sounds, is probably not true[1]<p>> <i>So combine that with the concept of a) eternal life, b) meeting your relatives in heaven (Kurzweil is planning to resurrect his dead father), and c) AI and post humans that are essentially godlike.</i><p>I'm personally skeptical of b), except for frozen people (cryonics).  If entropy wiped out the information, there's no way to resurrect someone. a) and c) however seem to be merely obvious consequences of Friendly AI (I assume immortality and wicked IQ are good things).

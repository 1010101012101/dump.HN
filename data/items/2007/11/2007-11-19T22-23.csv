81697,comment,81531,81540,0,0,shayan,,,"Few comments about your comment:<p>- <i>karma whore</i>: not really a nice way to talk to people, specially when its a tight community like here, kyro (but maybe thats why you don't disclose your real name and email here)!  if you spend some time on this site then you would know its a lot easier to gain karma points here than what you think. I could simply push any of my articles that are submitted to the first page, or write something up that would gain me a lot more points than you would think. ( Also, my understanding was that just submitting a URL will not get you points, but thats besides the point.)<p>
- after looking at <i>your submissions</i> it seems like you operate more like a leech than a true contributor.  Most of your submissions appear to be self-centered, and will <i>only</i> benefit you.  <i>We</i> are not here to help you on your textbook problems, finding you a partner or other stuff.<p>- if you think submitting links will get you more karma then you don't appear to be that smart! you should know there are easier ways to do it!!!<p>- FYI: the same exact story <i>was not</i> posted 30 min ago, its not even possible to do that with the same URL, <i>you</i> should know that.  But if you mean similar coverage then its a different story.  I have read them, but this was the one that was covering it live.  Also I thought some of the comments on TC were interesting.<p>- I do post out of genuine intention to contribute.  I actually believe I have posted many interesting articles, (some of which have even gone unnoticed).  Also most of my Karma is coming from my comments, which are usually a <i>lot</i> lengthier than the average comments on the site<p>- you are <i>right</i> I have received a lot of karma for the past 18 days, reason being is how active I have been!  I guess if you have been as engaged as me (and not as selfcentered as you are) you would have had thousands of points right now.

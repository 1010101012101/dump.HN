3368867,comment,3368771,3368771,102,0,evmar,,,"I don't know this poster, but I am pretty familiar with the problem he's encountering, as I am the person most responsible for the Chrome build for Linux.<p>I (and others) have put a lot of effort into making the Linux Chrome build fast.  Some examples are multiple new implementations of the build system ( <a href=""http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/02/ninja.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/02/ninja.h...</a> ), experimentation with the gold linker (e.g. measuring and adjusting the still off-by-default thread flags <a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-dev/browse_thread/thread/281527606915bb36/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-dev/...</a> ) as well as digging into bugs in it, and other underdocumented things like 'thin' ar archives.<p>But it's also true that people who are more of Windows wizards than I am a Linux apprentice have worked on Chrome's Windows build.  If you asked me the original question, I'd say the underlying problem is that on Windows all you have is what Microsoft gives you and you can't typically do better than that.  For example, migrating the Chrome build off of Visual Studio would be a large undertaking, large enough that it's rarely considered.  (Another way of phrasing this is it's the IDE problem: you get all of the IDE or you get nothing.)<p>When addressing the poor Windows performance people first bought SSDs, something that never even occurred to me (""your system has enough RAM that the kernel cache of the file system should be in memory anyway!"").  But for whatever reason on the Linux side some Googlers saw it fit to rewrite the Linux linker to make it twice as fast (this effort predated Chrome), and all Linux developers now get to benefit from that.  Perhaps the difference is that when people write awesome tools for Windows or Mac they try to sell them rather than give them away.<p>Including new versions of Visual Studio, for that matter.  I know that Chrome (and Firefox) use older versions of the Visual Studio suite (for technical reasons I don't quite understand, though I know people on the Chrome side have talked with Microsoft about the problems we've had with newer versions), and perhaps newer versions are better in some of these metrics.<p>But with all of that said, as best as I can tell Windows really is just really slow for file system operations, which especially kills file-system-heavy operations like recursive directory listings and git, even when you turn off all the AV crap.  I don't know why; every time I look deeply into Windows I get more afraid ( <a href=""http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/windows-hookers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2011/08/windows...</a> ).",1324280298

3368865,comment,3367382,3368356,4,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Economic crises inducing a transition from democracy to plutocracy/fascism, and massive military spending, ending in wars on multiple fronts.<p>There is one major thing missing from your description; it's so glaring and obvious that I'm amazed that you don't notice it. Nazis rose to power through a populist platform which promoted ethnic/racial hatred and reappropriation of resources from those perceived as morally ""corrupt"" (the Jewish people) or ""too powerful"" (the British empire). The Nazi leaders did not come to power first and then all of a sudden decided to exterminate the Jews out of the blue; the they went along with what was a populist sentiment at the time (while adding fuel to the fire by the means of propaganda and mass media which was relatively new at the time), and exploited that precisely that popular, hateful sentiment to guarantee their rise to power. I recommend watching a documentary called ""The Goebbels Experiment"" for a look from the inside on how it happened.<p>N.B. By going with what you're suggesting, any possible ""empire"" is fascist, which is blatantly wrong. Plutocracy is bad for various reasons, but plutocracy =/= fascism and genocide. I find it hilarious when people blame plutocracy for causing fascism because it is precisely the supposed ""plutocracy"" of the time (which was actually a codeword for rich Jews) which drove (indirectly of course) ignorant/resentful Germans in the 1930s to support Hitler and his clique.",1324280288

What if you had a choice of installing an ugly app that gets the job done then learn of another app that gets the job done just as well but is prettier? Let's say they're both free. You've never been in that situation?<p>Personally, I recently switched from one app to another that had less features than the first solely because of the UI. UI can actually be a feature in itself. In my case the UI was important enough for me to forego an app with several extra,museful features that I replaced with other apps in a workflow instead of an all-in-one package. I'm wondering if many people say they're all about function over form (especially developers of any kind) because it's looked at as a superficial reason by peers. Kind of like turning down a girl for a date because she's on the chubby side despite her amazing personality. You know you shouldn't be shallow so you gotta make sure you give a good excuse.

Some of the things I do to make it work on multiple images:<p>Template matching is your friend in this case, because most Waldos look similar. You already tried this in a basic way by searching for the stripes of a given color. You can make it more powerful by making the template include more properties, and work in more contexts. For instance: what if Waldo's a different size?<p>The other option is to pretend you don't know what Waldo looks like, find him in a bunch of images, label the subimages as ""waldo"" candidates, measure certain properties of those subimages, and find which of coordinates of feature space have similar properties. Then use these properties as your template.<p>Finally, you could train a classifier on subwindows like sergeyk suggested. This has some difficulty because where's waldo images are difficult to subdivide into subwindows on the scale of a single person. Do you move pixel by pixel? Do you divide it into a grid? Each grid will contain weird parts of people in each box. Etc. If you do find a way to divide the image into ""people"" -- perhaps by doing a preliminary ""person""-template sweep that identifies locations of people in the image -- then you can use a supervised learning algorithm to say ""yes, this person is waldo"" or ""nope, FRWONG!"", based on the image properties in the subwindow around that person.",1324278317

In many cases, states are not in any better a position to decide these issues than the federal government. (And with things like SOPA, per-state regulation would naturally be disastrous.) I think at this point, very few things can be well decided at the state level; thus, either the national gov't is needed to keep states from stepping on each others' toes (tax law and internet taxes), or the national gov't is needed to keep states from stepping on the rights of citizens of that state - which they are just as capable of doing as the national gov't was when the idea of state sovereignty was taken for granted.<p>tl;dr: states are as capable of screwing things up as the national gov't, and tend to be less transparent about it.",1324278281

When working an overnight shift, for example, I found it impossible to sleep more htan 4 hours per day (day because you get to sleep maybe 8am).<p>The funny thing is the impairment isn't linear throughout the day.  There are times when it is really bad (1-3am) and times when it is pretty good (dawn, during the daylight hours etc).  In general the only times I found myself impaired was at work.  I have talked to people who worked in other industry overnight and their experience was the same.<p>As far as I can tell, without tremendous amounts of caffeine, the brain seems to go partway to sleep, able to recover from approx. half of the outstanding sleep debt per day.  Part of the problem is the way in which we use caffeine to compensate.",1324278050

10362524,comment,10360911,10362484,0,0,OopsCriticality,,,"Publications and grants are the currency of academia: if one doesn&#x27;t have a recent publication record, a hiring committee doesn&#x27;t have a way to gauge one&#x27;s performance and capabilities as an academic; if one doesn&#x27;t have a history of getting grants, a hiring committee will be (rightfully) skeptical of one&#x27;s ability to bring in money.  Excepting teaching schools, one is hired for one&#x27;s abilities as an academic researcher to bring prestige (through publications and PR) and secure grants (along with that sweet, sweet F&A money).  To get grants, one needs publications and preliminary data.  One also needs grantsmanship skills, and one only gets those from direct experience.<p>A YCR &quot;fellow&quot; (or whatever it&#x27;d be called) would probably not be a competitive candidate for an academic position.  It&#x27;s not because they weren&#x27;t in academia, it&#x27;s because they will likely not have the work product used to measure performance in a academic setting.  A hiring committee is not going to risk department funds on someone with a non-existent track record when there&#x27;s a line out the door of other candidates.<p>I think OP is correct in perceiving that selecting YCR would probably close the door to a future in academia.  I will also predict that  YCR will have difficulty hiring top academic talent.",1444417196

Both offered great compensation and fun roles, but while the later stage startup gives me <i>a lot</i> of RSUs that will soon be liquid the earlier stage startup gives me stock options that expire under these kind of unfavorable terms.<p>There is a bit of a double standard on stock vesting between founders and early stage employees. Both take about the same amount of risk and the employees frequently give up more salary for less equity. However, while founders owns all vested stock outright the employee stock options most often expire after 30 to 90 days.<p>The quick stock option expiration is especially problematic since the termination might not be voluntary, and might be a result of changing life circumstances or a company-initiated termination.",1444417120

10362504,comment,10362141,10362421,0,0,SeoxyS,,,"If I understand the rules correctly, an ISO that is exercised more than 90 days after leaving a job is treated as an NSO, which means that it will be taxed at regular income tax rates instead of having the ability to be taxed at long-term cap gains rate. (This could reduce their value by an additional 15%+.)<p>That said, it&#x27;s irrelevant if you exercise and sell an ISO at the same time, because short-term cap gains are taxed as income tax, too.<p>The real interesting term is having the ability to early exercise your entire stock grant, <i>before</i> it vests and before there is a spread between its strike price and fair market value. (The company would have a repurchase right, to implement the vesting schedule.) That way the cost is very low, and there&#x27;s no worry of having to exercise in the future when it could be taxed unfavorably, and the clock for long-term capital gains starts early.",1444416959

Given human nature, I just can&#x27;t foresee a world where everyone lounges around in equally-served harmony.  No...there will always be an elite, and the elite will find a way to procure and consume a vastly disproportionate amount of resources.

I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re in a position to change your behavior or even that you <i>should</i>. But you seem to be aware that it goes against social norms and attracts attention.

What I do <i>agree</i> with is that <i>people have the right to speak to you</i> and it is <i>expected</i> when in a public place within a social culture. I simply disagree with your social expectations and consider it more harmful to promote an isolated society over one where an occasional intrusion is beneficial. They can be irritating to an individual at times, but promoting a standard of isolation and ignoring other&#x27;s is not something I can agree with.<p>Yesterday, the power was out in my town for scheduled maintenance. I went over to my neighbor&#x27;s house to ask if they were busy. Did I have any right to know if they were busy or not? No, how rude of me. They politely told me they had nothing to do and were waiting for the power to come back on. I did the oppressive act of asking them if they would like to play Chess until the power came on. Did I have the right to butt into his life like that? No, but he agreed to pass the time. In the end we enjoyed several hours of Chess until the power came back on.<p>What I should have done is sat in a pitch-black house for 3 hours because I have absolutely no right to trespass onto private property to commit the <i>revolting</i> act of speaking to someone. I&#x27;m a terrible person for asking them to essentially be my <i>entertainment</i> while the power was out. I&#x27;m also an asshole for discriminating by age and suggesting <i>Chess</i> of all things, because I assumed a 70 year old man would be more familiar or willing to play Chess than Cards Against Humanity or some other time waster.<p>Perspective matters. Your story made it seem like you felt you were being grilled because people were even <i>trying</i> to speak to you, you assume, because you are walking and that is bizarre. If you want to give it a narrative or illustrate how they were acting classist - <i>what</i> they say is a lot more important than the mere <i>attempting to speak to you</i> part.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that we would live in a better society if we ignored one another because we don&#x27;t have explicit or implicit (ie: being at a social place like a bar or club) permission to speak with someone.

In practice, private companies pursue 409A appraisals from independent qualified valuation firms either immediately after completion of a financing or other significant financial transaction (e.g. merger or acquisition), or, six to nine months of elapsed time since the prior appraisal, whichever comes sooner (more mature companies tend to pursue appraisals more frequently). The receipt of such an appraisal should provide a safe harbor to employees with regard to a potential tax liability as long as your company is less than 10 years old, you don’t have a liquidity event within 12 months after the option grant or you don’t have put or call rights on your company’s stock.&quot;<p><a href=""https://blog.wealthfront.com/409a/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.wealthfront.com/409a/</a>",1444415227

I have worked in research and tech startups, and in very many ways the two couldn&#x27;t be more different. Some of the best biotech research comes from incremental and ponderous study of minutiae, not &#x27;ends driven&#x27; processes.<p>From the perspective of a biotech researcher in the US, the funding model here is broken. As a result of funding levels falling for more than a decade, and universities being less willing to invest in individuals without consistent major funding, getting grants has become a very political process.<p>I applaud YC&#x27;s efforts. We need alternatives, but I am not sure that YC is interested in the same kinds of research that the legacy funding system used to support. Science is not sexy. The results can be incredibly sexy, but you never go in looking for those sexy results.<p>EDIT: In addition, it&#x27;s worth considering the difference in the peak talent age of a researcher as compared to a programmer. You can code in your bedroom as a preteen, but it&#x27;s very difficult to get unfettered access to a molecular research laboratory before the age of 22. The best researchers are older, and that changes the equation in important ways.",1444415044

Aren&#x27;t government positions notoriously underpaid compared to their private-sector counterparts?<p>Direct Federal hires could be underpaid compared to the private sector, yes. The government uses the General Schedule (GS) scale, which tops out at ~$160K after adjusting for cost of living (there&#x27;s a base salary and a CoL adjustment). There are rules over who can go in what grade and what step which would likely preclude most SE folks from being compensated appropriately. Those with PhDs and masters degrees would find it easier to get into the appropriate pay band.<p>Contractors can make good money, and, accounting for not having the middlemen, the Feds should be capable of paying higher salaries for technical fields and still save money. If we&#x27;re already magically reforming the government by bringing stuff in house (taking an act of Congress in many places; lots of agencies have caps on the number of employees, forcing contractor usage), then we should be able to also reform the pay scale.<p>>2. Doesn&#x27;t that mean that &quot;government software&quot; would end up being written by below-average developers and be significantly worse than private-sector software?<p>Sadly, that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s in place now. The developers in general are already worse than in the private sector. It&#x27;s not because of money, it&#x27;s because of incentives. The Feds aren&#x27;t good at killing bad projects or disciplining companies they hire.<p>What you&#x27;ll see on your typical Booz Allen, Leidos, SAIC, Lockheed, etc. team is a lot of highly educated and experienced people--the government highly incentivizes both education and experience in bidding processes--that are useless. The process beats them down. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re dumb; they&#x27;re usually not.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to get through the government processes, especially when getting into cleared work. The hiring processes tend to highly favor previous government work, so you end up with the same pool of people. You can&#x27;t easily hire new people, so you stick with what you&#x27;ve got.",1444414587

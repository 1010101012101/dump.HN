801743,comment,801659,801659,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"My guess is there's a huge sample bias here. PG was probably assuming a similar applicant pool to what YC gets (ie if YC ran a summer in Atlanta, almost all of them would move away after) but the reality is that Shotput's starting pool is much different and shall we say less ""serious"", by which I mean talented and motivated.<p>Not too be elitist, but YC is clearly the top of the food chain in the micro-angel funding niche, where the most motivated founders go first. It was the only one we applied to, and if I were doing it over again it still would be. Then there's a couple others a rung below it, like TechStars, and a rung below that with a couple players like LaunchBox and maybe Shotput. (I've actually never heard of them, which is hard to accomplish in this industry, but I'll assume they're pretty decent and it's just because I've been working too hard lately).<p>So the startup founders move their way down the chain from the top, with the best x% being selected at every tier. At the YC level, you've got the highest quality and most motivated talent pool. At the bottom levels you've probably got the people who either whiffed their way down the chain, or just are looking for one near where they live. If I lived in Atlanta (which I could, it's a great city) and wanted to do a startup but wasn't particularly keen on relocating I might give it a go, assuming the Shotput guys brought enough to the table to make up for the small equity stake.<p>I'd guess PG wasn't taking that into account with his initial comment. I'd love to know what % of their funded startups have founders who lived within driving distance beforehand.",1251950274

Good.  Single founder.  Bad.  But at least he's looking for more
people.  Went to MIT, 1600 SAT.  Probably fairly smart.  Wrote a
poker bot.  Now I'm starting to get interested; has the right
attitude.  Description of the software sounds plausible but generic.
Maybe it's good, but who can tell.  But little sister uses it;
that's impressive.  Scroll down to what he understands that competitors
don't get.  Wow: very concise and unequivocal.  I'm now basically
sold.  Scroll through the rest.  No red flags.  Did not make the
usual joke single founders make when asked how long the founders
have known one another.  Good answer to what might go wrong.   A-.

801731,comment,801554,801673,0,0,hedgehog,,,"Their world view goes something like this:<p>(subscribers + news subscribers - churn) * average rev. per user (ARPU, like ""arr-poo"") = $$$<p>How do you increase profits? A few options:<p>- Get more subscribers. Costs money in marketing $$$, only helps a little bit. Requires more infrastructure.<p>- Reduce churn. Customer satisfaction has been in the toilet for some time and will be for the foreseeable future. Multi-year contracts w/ termination fees help keep it under control.<p>- Sell more stuff to your existing customers (you have lots of those) as long as it doesn't cost you much (SMS, ring tones, ...). Minimal infrastructure requirements.<p>In this view, crappy phones with expensive additional services like SMS, roaming, ring tones, for-pay WAP, for-pay instant messenger, music stores, push-to-talk, etc., all make a ton of sense. Your incremental profitability is great because you don't need too much gear to support these things and you're already billing the customer. On top of that you can negotiate content deals and pretend that customers care about the exclusivity (mMode, VCAST, whatever).<p>This stuff is what carriers meant by ""data services"" a few years ago. What's happening now doesn't fit this model; rolling out better infrastructure costs a lot of money and one person can use a lot more capacity in data than voice. 1000 minutes of GSM audio is only about 200MB and costs about $60, meanwhile the same price gets you 5GB of data. Worse, porting a number is often a big hassle but nobody cares what my IP address is. Imagine a world where your company just moves bits and the government is starting to question your key protection against churn (ETFs). If you're an exec at a phone company this is unattractive. Their attitude is ""we don't want to be a pipe"" (actual quote from a C-level).<p>So it's not that they didn't know, they just dragged their feet a little bit. To be fair, AT&T in particular cobbled their network together out of a lot of acquisitions so they probably have had a hard time of it.",1251949795

And I finally have some idea what's going to happen to the company over the next 6 months or so, and a couple new products in development.<p>However, I've realized that to get over the current hump and be able to meet <i>next</i> year's goals, I'm going to need to be a lot more disciplined.<p>There have been a few weeks this year where I've been able to stay focused for most of the day and get a lot of stuff done -- usually I set micro-deadlines for particular features or aspects of a certain project.

At some events you can get away with using hotel guest Internet, which is cheaper ($10-15 per day).  Typically other network connectivity (fiber point to point, dry lines, VLANs, etc) is also expensive.  Power is sometimes charged for, but in some states that is illegal or included in the room rentals.   Some hotels and convention centers get around that by charging to hook up power, charging for the power drop equipment or charging to turn it on.<p>Don&#x27;t ever underestimate a hotel or conference center&#x27;s ability to bill large amounts of money for services their captive clients need.

We have spent the last 50 years enabling large mono-cultures and promoting specialization - which has done amazing things for food availability - at the expense that now a single plate of food easily contains ingredients from every continent - at a huge environmental impact.

It is not a protection that is available to people who simply cannot be bothered to put in an effort out of a plentiful account to meet the obligations that they have taken upon themselves.<p>It is similar for creative works. If you attempt to keep something updated, make a reasonable effort to do so, and that simply becomes infeasibly expensive to continue doing without suffering some form of serious ruin, then that&#x27;s fair enough. You made a reasonable attempt to meet your obligations, were wrong in your estimation of them, and being wrong shouldn&#x27;t cost you everything you have. You didn&#x27;t deal with your customer in, for lack of a better term, &quot;bad faith&quot; when you formed the implicit and/or declared contract upon which your deal wrested.<p>Mistakes happen, people should attempt to ameliorate the consequences of that mistake to a reasonable amount in order to meet the obligations that they have taken upon themselves and keep the strength and value of their word, their ability to make commitments to others in the world, high.<p>That is, I feel, different from simply deciding that one is not going to make a <i>profit</i> out of an obligation that they have taken upon themselves. And the strength of one&#x27;s word is reflected in how much one will suffer in order to keep the obligations that one has formed. As is the value of any deal that someone might make with someone in the future. Someone&#x27;s word is worth nothing when it is kept only in so far as it benefits them to keep it, and broken the next moment. I am unlikely to pay someone any sum of money, and would certainly not suffer them as an employee, if their attitude to their word, and the impressions that people could reasonably be expected to take away from what they said – the deals they made – was that they simply stopped trying to keep it the minute it ceased to be to their benefit to do so.<p>Most people do not act in that manner, if they did the strength of someone&#x27;s word would be almost meaningless and no deals would be made since the client could never expect to benefit from them.<p>#<p>As for the idea of selling something &quot;as is&quot;, contract law is not that simple. If it were, then outside of situations in which both parties had significant forms of leverage, all goods and services would be exchanged only on an &quot;as is&quot; basis. We would find ourselves in a situation similar to the one that used to concern rail travel: in which terms and conditions absolutely removing any responsibility that the rail company had towards their passengers safety were found on the back of rail tickets. Insofar as one desires to be able to form valuable contracts, to trade things of value, one should desire to live in a system that enforces a certain lower bounds upon the behaviour of parties, and the equability of contracts that can be formed, within that system.<p>Consequently, while I don&#x27;t pretend to understand it anywhere near entirely, there will almost doubtless be limitations on the disclaimers that you can place on various implied warranties (though this depends upon the relative jurisdictions governing the contract at the time it&#x27;s formed.) If one were relying on writing, &quot;as is&quot; on a piece of paper, and getting the client to sign it, as a means to escape their obligation with regards to their client&#x27;s statutory rights, I would not much care for their chances.<p>Most notably, as a matter of general principle, (and here we run into a problem, for the law may be different where you are,) it tends to be the case that one cannot form a contract entirely for one&#x27;s own benefit. That is a contract, to be valid, must be equitable. A contract to the effect of &quot;you shall give me your money, and in return I have no obligation to provide a good or service to you.&quot; Is clearly almost entirely, if not outright, to your benefit – and certainly of little to no benefit to your &quot;customers&quot; who in return for their money have no entitlement to any benefits nor access to reasonable redress in the even that they are denied something that you knowingly allowed them to form the impression they would receive. Likewise, contracts generally have to be decidable, that is to say that I cannot form a contract with you that goes something to the effect of, &quot;as long as I want&quot; or &quot;as long as it is to my benefit.&quot; It simply does not matter what you choose to put in the contract if the contract itself is void, or voidable due to abuse of certain principles enshrined in the underlying statutes or common law that allow the formation of contracts to take place.<p>Of course, if one buys a used car from a shady salesman, one has little hope of redress through the courts when it turns out that one was not being dealt with in good faith. That has more to do with the difficulty of making law apply to them, then it does a matter of principle or of justice. It strikes me that apps, for smart phones, (distinguished because Microsoft seems to be calling desktop programs apps these days,) bear significant similarities to the shady used-car salesman model. That strikes me as neither a moral nor a legal argument though - it strikes me more as an &#x27;I can get away with it&#x27; argument.",1447277816

This is an album I play when driving through the woods or staring at the stars.

Most VCs and hedge funds also invest a substantial amount of their own capital in the funds they manage, so it&#x27;s not like it would be a radical change.<p>A few years ago I went to the Aspen Ideas Festival. One of the speakers was David Rubinstein of the Carlyle Group. Someone cheekily asked him what the tax on carried interest should be. He said &quot;It <i>should</i> be zero. But politicians &#x27;earn&#x27; so much money in donations by by threatening to repeal it, I predict it will always come up as an issue every three or four years, and will always stay about what it is now.&quot;",1447277228

On the one hand, there <i>is</i> still a good amount of quality music coming out on places like Soundcloud/Bandcamp. On the other hand,  many/most of those artists are likely not making much of a living off of it, and that&#x27;s sad because it means that they produce less music that we might want to listen to because they have to spend their time on other things (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/business/to-stay-relevant-in-a-career-workers-train-nonstop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/business/to-stay-relevant-...</a>) like working/studying/retraining (my own extremely-niche music is/was something I chose to only do in my spare time, knowing the reality.) It also may be dissuading would-be artists from creating something in the first place, which means we&#x27;re deprived of those potentially great works. Definitely a negative.<p>Relatedly, I sometimes wonder about how much of the compromised musical vision (AKA selling out) is actually a myth in terms of pop music itself. The counterfactual is something like: artist X, who is making some kind of music, would have made some other kind of music that they would have preferred to make (because it was more in line with their vision) if they had the economic freedom to do so. Is that really right, or are they &#x27;making&#x27; what they would have made anyway? I quote &#x27;making&#x27; because of the number of non-music writing pop stars (the aforementioned four guys with all the top 40 hits who are the ones actually writing the songs) is larger than many might imagine. Are those pop stars really just &#x27;celebrities who specialized in music&#x27;, rather than &#x27;musicians who compromised their visions&#x27;? Tool managed to break through the niche->pop barrier in the 1990s despite their decidedly non-mainstream, aurally challenging (and compelling) sound, but does anyone believe there are little Tools just hiding inside of Justin Timberlake, let&#x27;s say? If someone like that becomes elevator muzak, is that really a &#x27;sellout&#x27; when it&#x27;s designed that way from the outset? This one is hard to disentangle.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s another way to frame it. Maybe the problem isn&#x27;t &#x27;selling out&#x27;, per se, but that niche audiences, unless you are somehow able to get to the &quot;100 really super duper true fans&quot; or its equivalent, just don&#x27;t pay the bills very well. We have your Kickstarter and we have Patreon, and we have all that, but does that sustain the number of potential artists - some of whom may create incredible works - in the modern economy? Did it ever? (I&#x27;m sure some would-be musicians starved during the actual patron eras, too.)<p>The Superstar effect (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/business/winners-take-all-but-cant-we-still-dream.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/business/winners-take-all-...</a>, <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09/winner-take-all-economics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/09/win...</a>) is real and cross-cuts industries; an economy-wide phenomenon. I think it&#x27;s going to be difficult for these platforms to serve as a real counterweight to that, as much as I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like them to, because they&#x27;re swamped by much larger forces. We&#x27;ve democratized distribution, and some of the platforms /have/ widened the economic net a bit, and I&#x27;m glad about that, but the forces are larger than I think they&#x27;ll ever be able to handle, at least in the US.<p>That brings us to the next question: is the story the same in still relatively-low-cost-of-living Berlin (where a Kickstarter/Patreon might actually be able\nto replace serving coffee, giving the artist the ability to work on art full time), for example? This is especially important for collaborative styles of music. We can tell a starving artist &quot;just live go somewhere cheap&quot;, but rural Minnesota is probably not going to have the kind of music scene necessary to engender the collaborative creativity / connections that you&#x27;re going to get in Berlin (or once upon a time, on the Lower East Side/East Village in New York), and also have a receptive local audience interested in things like live music.<p>So maybe we add another qualifier: &quot;enough to live in a collaborative, musically vibrant place.&quot; Can these platforms ever do that? I don&#x27;t think by themselves they can really solve that problem. Not all, gloom, though, as I think there might be external solutions worth entertaining:<p>1) Artist subsidies or tax credits. Hate this one, and lots of other people like do too, as incentives and administration are mess, but worth mentioning since I&#x27;ve seen it proffered before.<p>2) GBI. Possible superb fix, not going to happen any time soon.<p>3) Massive development leading to lower rents in desirable areas, so the next wave of those to be pushed out could stay (Ridgewood, Queens is a good example of cheap and artist friendly now, but possibly at risk in 5-10 years.) I wrote a whole post on this (<a href=""https://medium.com/@opirmusic/fixing-the-nyc-rent-crisis-or-the-rent-is-still-too-damn-high-edb13ca853cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@opirmusic/fixing-the-nyc-rent-crisis-or-...</a>) Most powerful one, in my opinion.<p>4) Artist housing: something that has been tried before, and I think is worth considering again. Administration would be the tricky part, but it at least seems possible.<p>5) Generalized cheap co-housing with shared amenities. I know some companies are working on this, but it remains to be seen if they can make the numbers work in an NYC or an SF. I really like this one, and I hope someone makes it work.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d also add that my original reply was generalized to the job market as a whole; it applies just as much to your C++ hacker who would rather be making interactive art rather than writing device drivers, or to a marketer that is actually good at what they do and would rather being working in politics or something, but takes a job at an ad agency helping to advertise soft drinks to keep their little rat body from going overboard.<p>To use an example in technology: I understand the appeal of working on complicated distributed setups, using cool algorithms at scale, etc., but how many people <i>really want</i> to work on &quot;thinking about how to make people click ads&quot;, and how many are there because that&#x27;s how you make good money (and by extension, achieve financial safety and independence)?",1447277003

This means that Congress is compelling the nation at large to turn over a higher % of GDP to financial intermediaries.<p>It would be disingenuous to claim to disbelieve this unless a Senator stood up and said his goal is to &quot;turn over a higher % of GDP to financial intermediaries.&quot;  That is certainly not his exoteric goal and probably not even something that he thinks about.

You signup, do a &#x27;git push heroku master&#x27; and your application is online.<p>Say instead that you are Yelp, you have a couple hundred developers all of whom are clamouring for the same ease of deployment that they can get with Heroku but that&#x27;s not appropriate for a whole bunch of reasons (lots of internal apps for accounting or credit stuff, a custom HR app, who knows) and at Yelp&#x27;s scale it is cost effective to start having devops/sysadmin type people on staff instead of just rolling that into your Heroku costs.<p>So the answer is that you use something like this deployed to your own hardware in house, or you use Deis or Convox or some other Docker solution to deploy to AWS or a bunch of Virtual Private Servers or something.

Almost as if it is assumed that they only got that way by some illegal/immoral means.<p>Then, you get the other half of that side of the coin. That even if the rich did earn their money using legal/ethical means, they don&#x27;t deserve it (or to keep/use it). It&#x27;s inherent in all discussions of wealth inequality. Really, it&#x27;s not enough to just let it be, but everyone wants to play social-engineer with progressively richer individuals.<p>One additional thing, that you can see running in this discussion. That legality is not somehow an indicator of fairness/justice. A few commentators here have noted that rich people use tax &quot;holes&quot; and legal financial constructs to &quot;evade&quot; tax, as if it&#x27;s a bad thing, and as if it&#x27;s not something that was put in place by legal, democratic means.

Which suggested they were doing something fundamentally wrong.<p>The most obvious thing, to me, was that they were using a chemical called HFIP &quot;hexafluoroisopropanol&quot; to initially dissolve the silk proteins.  This solvent forces proteins into a form called alpha helix which in this case abolishes the protein soluble - but the transition to beta sheet (which it needs to be for its strength) is a poor one.  The amyloid field was using this a lot, and the results were horrible.  The result was extremely irreproducible results, which the field papered over by doing experiments with an n of 1.  My graduate thesis was basically doing experiments without HFIP and getting results that actually make sense (with higher Ns).<p>I reached out to Refactored Materials, which at the time was trying to do the spider silk thing, to suggest they play with the procedures that I had developed for amyloid work, but a trip to visit SF and give a lecture fell through.<p>Recently, I was in a conversation about a SF biotech that I think rose from the ashes of RM trying to do the spider silk thing, and apparently they aren&#x27;t using HFIP (or TFE, trifluoroethanol, a similar solvent with similar effects) anymore, but I didn&#x27;t get too many more details because these companies tend to keep their techniques close to their chest.<p>Sadly, I still see papers publishing amyloid work with HFIP and TFE going through my google scholar feed (I am now almost 7 years post-PhD).",1447275626

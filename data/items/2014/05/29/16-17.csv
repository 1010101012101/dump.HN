7817220,comment,7815906,7815906,2,0,Denzel,,,"I like the curation of free educational content in a specific area because it eliminates the guesswork, and duplicated effort, of filtering for high-quality resources. Thanks to Claudia Gold for the amazing amount of work she put into this. My main gripe comes with the majority of these data science courses/tracks.<p>It appears that no comprehensive treatment of applied data science exists. For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been searching high-and-low. I understand collaborative filtering; I&#x27;ve heard about the Netflix recommendation challenge ad nauseam; I grasp machine learning, bayesian statistics (prior, posterior, conjugate prior distributions, etc.) on a superficial level. Conversationally, I can hold my own with practitioners&#x27;, albeit on a beginner level.<p>But what I, and others, want to learn is how to apply these techniques in a scalable way on a real production system. Right now, it&#x27;s easy to conjecture about what could/should be done, but there&#x27;s a lack of confidence in how to achieve the goals. I&#x27;m experimenting with a collaborative filtering problem using Cassandra as the data store for thumbs up/down ratings on products, and Hadoop for the MR pipeline; it&#x27;d be great to have more visible examples available. Is there any place I could find detailed information on real, online machine learning/statistical inference systems?",1401382780

Her focus was the street and interactions between residents, shopkeepers, and other inhabitants of the city.  Her realization (mirrored well by Garrison Keillor in a biographical documentary I caught a year or so back) was that <i>cities are collections of neighborhoods or villages</i>.  rglover her contrasts his impression of Chicago with the small towns of Ohio in which he grew up.  My experience with large cities is that frequently their <i>downtowns</i> are impersonal (though even there I&#x27;ve found my niches), but it&#x27;s in the neighborhood that their character really shows.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a character you don&#x27;t much care for, but often there&#x27;s a sense of place and community, even in dynamic and rapidly changing cities, which can persist for years, decades, or even generations.  It does take time to appreciate and find, though.<p>Back to Jacobs:  finding her <i>The Life and Death of Great American Cities</i> was a watershed for me (and I can still remember the marginalia in my uni&#x27;s copy at one of her common-sense observations:  &quot;God bless you, Jane&quot;).  <i>Cities and the Wealth of Nations</i> and <i>The Economy of Cities</i> changed many of my perceptions of what economics was about and where its real centers lay (it&#x27;s rarely nations or states, cities and metropolitan areas, yes).<p>Wright&#x27;s interesting.

7817084,comment,7799524,7816749,1,0,kbenson,,,"Thanks, that does explain a lot of your reasoning more clearly.  I&#x27;m not sure I can change my assessment of the situation though, as the relative timings of these events, which I think matter greatly, aren&#x27;t known to me, and the Rakudo interpretation of these circumstances isn&#x27;t known to me either.  I believe the Rakudo response <i>can</i> be explained by their belief that the special relationship between projects was unsalvageable, and the was forward was no longer in Parrot.  In that case I try to fall back on my default, which is to assume people will act in their best interests while also trying to minimize damage and discomfort to others unless given cause.<p>Whether the actions of the Rakudo developers indeed did cause a major Parrot exodus is something I&#x27;ll easily cede at this point.  Whether that was intended, unintended or the <i>opposite</i> of what was intended seems to be what we are really talking about here (because I believe intention can matter, not in assignment of blame, but as possible mitigation of scale).<p>The irony of this is that Parrot seems to now well and truly be a P6 focused VM, as the only work done on it (besides rurban and util) is by Rakudo devs to fix bugs or make small changes to new Rakudo stuff works.  Why rurban still bothers is beyond me, AIUI he&#x27;s still got p2 to work on.<p>In any case, you&#x27;ve been more than a good sport in humoring me in all this; you put up with more from me than I would have imagined.

7817082,comment,7809024,7816575,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> No, the market is &quot;consumers of mobile devices, upon which apps can be distributed or installed.&quot;<p>Let me see if I can explain why that&#x27;s wrong.<p>> What you&#x27;re proposing could easily be said about any supply of any good or service owned by anybody or any company. If each company&#x27;s product distribution constitutes a monopoly of &quot;Product X Market&quot;, then &quot;monopoly&quot; has been redefined.<p>Technically a trademark is a monopoly, albeit a legally granted one. But that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>For example, Exxon 87 unleaded gasoline is completely fungible with BP 87 unleaded gasoline. They&#x27;re for all practical purposes the same product, so they&#x27;re in the same market even though they&#x27;re different brands. An iPhone is <i>less</i> fungible with, say, a Samsung phone. They&#x27;re still close enough substitutes to be plausibly considered the same market (although, for example, in the Microsoft case Windows and MacOS were found not to be in the same market). But that&#x27;s still not the market I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;m talking about distribution of apps for these devices.<p>Let&#x27;s start with a preliminary issue. Are iPhone apps in the same market as Android apps? Can they be used as substitutes for one another? The answer is clearly no. You can&#x27;t run an Android app on an iPhone. This is substantially <i>why</i> Windows and MacOS were found not to be in the same market, but again that&#x27;s not the market I&#x27;m interested in here. The point is that iOS apps and Android apps are not substitutes. And that doesn&#x27;t even necessarily separate the markets for the <i>devices</i> -- because even though Angry Birds for iOS is a different product sold to different customers than Angry Birds for Android, the fact that the quantity and quality of apps available for each platform is comparable means that the platforms themselves are still reasonable substitutes for one another. But you can imagine how that could change if app developers stopped developing for one platform or the other, which reinforces the point.<p>So back to the apps. Is there competition for the <i>production</i> of iOS apps? Of course there is. There are thousands of developers; that&#x27;s not at issue. But distribution is different than production. General Electric is not Walmart. Is there competition for distribution? No. No one is allowed to distribute iOS apps but Apple. There are no substitutes, Apple has a distribution monopoly in that market.<p>That is not how most &quot;brands&quot; work. You don&#x27;t have to buy cars through Exxon. You don&#x27;t have to buy gasoline through Ford. You don&#x27;t even have to buy Android apps through Google Play. Apple is doing something unusual which results in the monopoly.",1401381478

We also want clear principles and guidelines that our HR and admin staff can follow when doing their work, so that they don&#x27;t step over the line in an enthusiastic and well-meant moment - and we don&#x27;t want detailed rules, because those constrain rather than inform.<p>Sure, sure, I could spend some crafting just the right words, but being of the &quot;lazy developer school&quot;, I&#x27;d rather stand on the shoulders of giants, as it were: If your company has a social networks policy or statement of principles or code of conduct, etc., that you like and respect, and that you can share, please do.<p>If this isn&#x27;t clear, please do let me know.

Now I am a CS major at my local university after transferring (for various reasons including cost). What the author doesn&#x27;t understand is that when we says, &quot;It sounds like he wants those topflight English majors after all: graduates adept at conceiving, articulating, and supporting their own ideas—not some “specific answer” the professor is looking for&quot;, you actually get much more creative solutions to CS problems because implementations may vary, but are still bounded by the problem. In English (and potentially moreso in philosophy), you are not really bounded by anything, so it&#x27;s incredibly easy to get at least a &quot;good&quot; grade, while getting an A is entirely at the mercy of a subjective grader with no clear grading rubric to distinguish a B+ from an A. Further, there isn&#x27;t any domain to learn, so you can fairly easily skim the cliffnotes of every assigned reading and produce at least a B essay. Thus, no work ethic. CS really forces you into a discipline because there is a domain to learn as well as projects to code, and you can&#x27;t BS a program at the last minute. If an essay doesn&#x27;t have a coherent conclusion at 4am, turn it in and get a B. But if your program doesn&#x27;t compile at 4am...<p>From my experience I consider CS to be far more challenging in terms of critical thinking, work ethic, and ability to solve complex problems. Also interesting is the camaraderie the students in these classes develop as we solve hard problems together, with the knowledge that if you&#x27;ve made it this far in the major, you&#x27;re pretty capable. To echo the sentiment of another poster, you would be pretty blown away be the ineptitude of many liberal arts majors (apart from their complete lack of relevant domain knowledge) who are able to cruise through their classes for all the reasons mentioned above.",1401379978

You have to get away from the &quot;all hands on deck&quot; during an incident once your company gets beyond about 3-4 engineers or your feature velocity is going to get destroyed.<p>Also, as your company gets larger, you&#x27;ll find that managing the communication around the incident is just as important as fixing the problem. Customers HATE being left in the dark, so it&#x27;s important to figure out who needs to know things are broken (internally and externally) and how that&#x27;s communicated.<p>Heroku did an excellent writeup on this topic recently: <a href=""https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-at-heroku"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/5/9/incident-response-...</a> -- even if you don&#x27;t adopt the full system outlined there, at least ensure you&#x27;re thinking about it, especially the communication part.",1401379320

Basically, a bully.\nBullies look for easy targets, because they want to attack someone who won&#x27;t fight back. You&#x27;ll appear to be an easy target if:<p>- You are a minority in the population where the bully hunts<p>- You appear to be isolated from others<p>- You are associated in the bully&#x27;s mind with a group that the bully considers easy pickings<p>Bullies in general are not interested in the ideologies or politics associated with their attacks. They&#x27;ve just learned what buttons to push in order to cause maximum fear and powerlessness. When their victim feels disempowered, the bully feels empowered for causing it.<p>The only way to stop a bully is to hit them back. They&#x27;re cowards at the core, and will go looking for easier victims if you fight back.",1401379294

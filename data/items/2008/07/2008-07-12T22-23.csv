244725,comment,244009,244164,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"I think it's corporations that have to pay tax twice, not LLC's... Or maybe I'm reading what you wrote wrong?  But seriously, llc's are much easier than s or c corporations to manage, and frankly your chance of hitting the IPO lottery are pretty bad, statistically.  You'll save time and money on the llc and as long as you manage things properly a decent lawyer ought to be able to switch you to c or s corp status should you hit the big time.<p>One other problem with a Delaware corporation, specifically, is that if you're in California, you may be subject to their tax in addition to Delaware.<p>Also, one other point.  Investors love Delaware corporations because they know them and also because they tend to be favorable to the investor.  You probably want to read that last sentence again.  Also I watched a presentation by some lawyers from Reed Smith who argued That California may actually be preferable to non-investors.<p>But the best piece of advice I can give you is to pick one and go forward quickly without dwelling too much.<p>fred",1215903179

It's easier to see the couple thousands of success stories <i>attributed to</i> a religion than the millions of failures we don't hear about.",1215903105

But that doesn't mean they're the answer to all software development issues.<p>Case and point: Software development process at Google vs Microsoft. The former is more like code-n-shoot (not all, but some), the latter is more disciplined due to years of experience. The former is close to the definition of ""hackers"" while the latter is more of ""developers"" type.",1215902547

244718,comment,244621,244621,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's probably worth noting that Eric Sink and PG are in different industries.  Eric Sink started a company that sells software.  PG started a company that sells a service enabled by software, and invests largely in similar companies.<p>One of the reasons PG suggests building server-based software is that you have more flexibility in language choice, and hence more ability to hire great hackers.  But there are other reasons to go for that business model: recurring revenue, fewer distribution hurdles, less chance of incompatibilities, ownership of customer data, network effects, etc.<p>I think there was an article about open-source software and Sun's cash hemorrhage that made it to Hacker News recently - it was either here or Proggit.  That's another instance.  Google was cited in the article as a company that supports open-source - well, that's because Google's business model is selling services supported by software, and so it behooves them to get the price of software down as low as possible.<p>For that matter - hardware, software, and software services are all complements (in a microeconomic sense), and so each of them has an incentive to commoditize the others.  Hence we have Google supporting open-source and buying commodity hardware; Sun and RedHat supporting open-source; Microsoft training lots of developers and providing plenty of tools for them; Apple basing OS X on open UNIX instead of proprietary MacOS 9; and great hackers everywhere supporting open source, because it drives up the value of the service they provide.",1215902088

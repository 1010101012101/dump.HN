Android is getting hit hard by the patent wars. webOS is soon to be open, has a strong community of tinkerers already, and to develop for it all you need to know are HTML/CSS/JS - much like developing for the mobile web. If HP plays their cards right, and Android as a platform is enervated enough by the companies that have an interest in it muddling it up with suits and countersuits, perhaps webOS will get its chance to shine.",1325181544

3404509,comment,3403924,3404402,23,0,LeafStorm,,,"A good introduction to MapReduce is probably CouchDB, where you use it for database views instead of SQL-style queries. The basic concepts are:<p>- The ""Map"" phase takes a key/value pair of input and produces as many other key/value pairs of output as it wants. This can be zero, it can be one, or it can be over 9000. Each Map over a piece of input data operates in isolation.<p>- The ""Reduce"" phase takes a bunch of values with the same (or similar, depending on how it's invoked) keys and reduces them down into one value.<p>A good example is, say you have a bunch of documents like this:<p><pre><code>    {""type"": ""post"",
     ""text"": ""..."",
     ""tags"": [""couchdb"", ""databases"", ""js""]}
</code></pre>
And you want to find out all the tags, and how many posts have a given tag. First, you have a map phase:<p><pre><code>    function (doc)
      if (doc.type === ""post"") {
        doc.tags.forEach(function (tag) {
          emit(tag, 1);
        });
      }
    }
</code></pre>
In this case, it filters out all the documents that aren't posts. It then emits a `(tag, 1)` pair for each tag on the post. You may end up with a pair set that looks like:<p><pre><code>    (""c"", 1)
    (""couchdb"", 1)
    (""databases"", 1)
    (""databases"", 1)
    (""databases"", 1)
    (""js"", 1)
    (""js"", 1)
    (""mongodb"", 1)
    (""redis"", 1)
</code></pre>
Then, your reduce phase may look like:<p><pre><code>    function (keys, values, rereduce) {
      return sum(values);
    }
</code></pre>
Though the kinds of results you get out of it depend on how you invoke it. If you just reduce the whole dataset, for example, you get:<p><pre><code>    (null, 9)
</code></pre>
Because that's the sum of the values from <i>all</i> the pairs. On the other hand, running it in group mode will reduce each key separately, so you get this:<p><pre><code>    (""c"", 1)
    (""couchdb"", 1)
    (""databases"", 3)
    (""js"", 2)
    (""mongodb"", 1)
    (""redis"", 1)
</code></pre>
Since the sum of all the pairs with ""databases"" was 3, the value for the pair keyed as ""databases"" was 3. You're not limited to summing - any kind of operation that aggregates multiple values and can be grouped by key will work as well.<p>Like you said, there are problems that this doesn't work for. But for the problems it <i>does</i> work for, it's very computationally efficient and fun.",1325181398

They created incredibly accessible OS that could be used by the masses even without any previous computer experience. And to give credit to Microsoft marketing, they sold this product so well that they had over 90% of market share. It's debatable whether that's a good thing or not.

There've been good years in the preceding decade.<p>Except for 3D. But how much of an effect is 3D having? Most movies aren't 3D.<p>I'll say this: I went to see Super 8 at an old 60's-70's style theater in the far-out suburbs, one almost identical to the ones I saw movies in when I was a kid. No stadium seating. Simple seats. No cupholders. Massive screen. Minimal concessions. Maybe it was just the movie I was seeing --- like how watching South Park on your computer enhances the experience --- but it was awesome.<p>Ultimately, my bet is that the problem with theaters is simple: for the core market (the family of four that wants blockbuster mainstream product), the substitutes are just too good now.

Each machine produces over 12,000 units every single hour, 24 hours a day -- that's over 2 million every week, with only one or two labor hours per machine-hour. And our machines are not even that big or modern; if we were to replace them with new machines, we could easily scale to three times that much per machine-hour. Technologies such as this help us design a prototype to validate a product for a customer before building molds, but it would never be an actual production process.

That it's couched in the usual rivalry terms is unfortunate, but hey, that's the way of the world.<p>It's legitimate to say that Android will be the driving force for commoditizing smartphones, however. iOS will not be that force, and I think that's fine. That has never been Apple's goal, and it shows. It's like saying Mercedes won't drive commoditization of the latest feature in their car (e.g., HUDs or auto-parallel-parking). No, that'll be a smaller company. Mercedes is in charge of being up front putting it in to begin with for the people willing to pay more to get it. Once it's become cheaper, Ford can then integrate it in their upper lines, and then their mid-levels, and then it becomes a standard feature for pretty much all cars.<p>Similarly, Apple basically rewrote the book on smartphone UIs. There is very little you can say to truly countermand that. They may not be the 100% originators of all of the ideas, but the iPhone was the first phone of its kind. Android followed along, and started out expensive, then got cheaper, and now they're moving towards ultra-cheap smartphones running Android. Same evolution. The products have different purposes and different targets, that's all.<p>The only reason I bring this up is that I really don't often see flamewars between Mercedes drivers and Ford drivers. I suppose this might be because car companies differentiate tiers by brand, while in the case of Android, there are both high-end and low-end Android phones that are marketed under the exact same name, and these will obviously provide a different experience.",1325180785

At least until I hit the middleware layer then I tend to use Java, but much of that decision is out of comfort and volume of libraries available.",1325180040

Companies for which this paradigm ""doesn't fit the [company] culture"" are going to have to make a choice: keep things secret server side and compromise on the UX or move things client side for the sake of a better UX and compromise on secrecy of source code.<p>Those companies that have secrecy as a cultural value are going to be at a clear disadvantage from a UX point of view. The web is getting faster. People in general are becoming less and less tolerant of load times and other delays. The success of native apps proves this. Choosing secrecy will hurt your company unless you truly have a sauce so special that people will be tolerant of latency to taste it.<p>Native apps are the last refuge of companies that want to maintain end-to-end secrecy throughout the entire stack. The fragmentation of smart phones suggests that web apps are the future because every apps with social features is less useful if only people with the same kind of device as you can use it. Companies will have no choice but to develop in a space that is open.<p>As a consolation to companies with secrecy as a cultural value, the locus of computation is increasingly blurred between the browser and the server.

I just don't think any of the authors have really worked with a 3D printer hands on.<p>I'm a mechanical engineer designing products on a daily basis. We have a (really good) 3D printer and pump out amazing models all the time. Our's uses a fairly strong plastic and allows for things like moving linkages and very fine detail. The models are an amazing aid to communication and design. But ultimately they won't change our manufacturing process - the materials are too weak for our needs. So we make prototypes out of plastic and then the actual manufacturing run will be metal.<p>That really points out the problem with these columns that suggest 3D Printers are about to drastically change manufacturing. These 3D printers are only really a manufacturing revolution to people pumping out plastic (or weak powdered metal) products in low volumes (<1,000 units) and sizes between a few mm and meter or two cube. That actually doesn't cover a whole lot of products - the unit numbers are the thing that rules out most things you would think of.<p>3D Printers are great in the design phase - but a contractor like Shapeways will ultimately benefit the most from that.<p>Actual manufacturing of products was disrupted far more by CNC control. Truthfully a 3D Printer for all it's fancy tech is just an extension of CNC machining into building up from scratch instead of cutting down from stock.<p>CNC changed everything. You can CNC machine shapes that would have just been impossible before, on a size scale that no 3D printer today can match. You can use any material, and you replace REALLY SKILLED labor (a machinist) with a machine. That was dramatic. The 3D printer is just small potatoes compared to the change that has already happened over the last 30 years.",1325178072

3404254,comment,3403929,3404186,8,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well Yes but there's a backstory to that.<p>If you talk to teachers who worked in the pre-union days they'll tell you it was a nightmare.  Because it was run by low-level politicians (school board members) who were cowardly to the point of causing havok.<p>Put it this way.  Most people don't know the political positions of their individual school board members.  So if someone comes to their house and says ""this member is bad"" they'll generally vote against them on the theory of ""better safe than sorry"".  Which meant every crazy parent who thought their kid was treated unfairly would raise a fuss and get teachers fired because the Principal answered to the School Board members and those members had extremely tenuous holds on their position.  Meaning teachers were getting fired fairly regularly, often for doing nothing wrong.<p>Teachers Unions were born out of that abuse.  The problem now is we've swung to the other extreme.  Where even teachers who are bad can't get fired.  But I wouldn't say the problem is the union contracts.  If anything it's that we haven't found an appropriate metric for measuring teacher performance.",1325178038

You will be able to, as you&#x27;ll probably spend significant time interacting with everyone, but your employees won&#x27;t. Each will be focused on their own project and won&#x27;t have enough visibility across the company to notice output.<p>However all of them will notice if someone arrives late and you don&#x27;t do anything about it. We had one specific case were someone constantly arrived 2-3 hours late. People very &quot;subtly&quot; started complaining (and I mean very subtly). No one ever mentioned or talked about what the person was working on or if he was producing great code (his code was very good btw). Neither did they asked why he was arriving late - they only assumed it was not OK and felt it was unfair.",1373500753

6023640,comment,6020334,6023159,1,0,osth,,,"Ah, the bikeshed.  IMO the most relevant bit of pop psychology I&#x27;ve ever seen wielded by a programmer in a mailing list/online forum.  It&#x27;s validity is so seemingly self-evident, I&#x27;ll bet this concept has been christened under other names as well, maybe before or after the book from which PHK quoted.<p>In any case, I absolutely agree with your assessment.<p>As someone who claimed to have known Snowden from past gaming posted in a brief note (on Svbtle or Tumblr I think), this surveillance issue needs a story, as in one with characters, a plot, a beginning and an ending.  The American public (whatever that refers to) is much like a kindergarten class right after milk and cookies.  They are ready for storytime after which they will promptly take a nap and wake up with a clear head, ready to play, eat and be entertained by the next story.<p>I believe I read that someone is already preparing for a full length film about Snowden and his daring deed.  I&#x27;d say that script will need quite a bit of poetic license and embellishment.  As it stands, there&#x27;s no story.  There&#x27;s no narrative.  NSA slides?  Boring.<p>Who is the hero?  Who is the villain?  What is the moral of the story?  (Hollywood usually fills one in that meets sponsor approval.)<p>Is it really so surprising that the government is engaged in mass surveillance?  Hardly.  The American people are a generally suspicious and cynical lot.  They don&#x27;t need evidence.  Spying is not enough to shock them.<p>To get the American people to actually care about something, they need to be entertained.<p>We tried to entertain them in the beginning: focusing on Snowden&#x27;s girlfriend, his Ars comments, etc.  But there&#x27;s no Starr report, no stain on a party dress, no candid photos to feed the innuendos.  Close, but there&#x27;s no cigar.<p>Back to sleep we go.... zzz(8)...",1373500676

It loads Google, with a search result, with the top result being the address I want.  I move my hand to the mouse, click for GM, it loads my search, and I continue using the mouse to navigate GM.<p>The alternative (afaik) is loading GM somehow (bookmark?  type URL and hit enter?  other?), waiting a surprisingly long time for GM to load, then typing the address, then hitting enter, THEN I can move my hand to the mouse and start the mouse-oriented navigation..

You will learn by yourself which ship should be killed first, how to outmaneuver your enemies, how to devise them, etc. Many pilots have an excellent k/d ratio but they can&#x27;t compete against a lone ranger even with a lone ranger with a &quot;bad ratio&quot;.<p>So he had two Formula 1 but the real key to his success was because he knew each law of the world and he was a master when he fought.

That customer clearly had none, and furthermore didn&#x27;t believe the support person when they repeatedly tried to explain things to her. We tend to see things like, say, boxers on their website and we instantly feel a connection to a person where none may be warranted. To unilaterally make that connection with an abusive person is a recipe for unhappiness and disappointment.<p>I feel reminded about my startup time, we had customers like this. &quot;The website you built doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; - &quot;Why, what&#x27;s wrong?&quot; - &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I can&#x27;t get on the internet today. This is your fault. I want my money back.&quot; - &quot;Sir, if your internet is down, that&#x27;s nothing we can help you with. Also, I thought things were going pretty good with our project.&quot; - &quot;If you can&#x27;t help me, you&#x27;re clearly incompetent. I&#x27;m going to sue you. You broke my emails, too.&quot; And so on.<p>A few times we actually sent someone over there to help with (in this example) their faulty DSL connection. This never solves anything. There won&#x27;t be any gratitude, and the customer will be reinforced in thinking it&#x27;s your fault. In essence they&#x27;re being rewarded for abusiveness and unwillingness to think, too. From now on, every time his connection breaks it will be your fault. And you can&#x27;t bill that time either. Furthermore, while you&#x27;re sending someone over on the basis of goodwill and empathy, that guy will badmouth you all over town.<p>Of course, people have bad days, and there can be mitigating factors.

The higher end cameras made a huge difference in quality. The lower end also could not support higher end flashes.<p>I own a proofing company with thousands of users, and ran a print lab for years. You don&#x27;t need more than 200PPI for larger prints and thus can save a lot.<p>In fact, considering most people order prints 11x14 and smaller, having the larger megapixels actually hurt quality because the printers (Fuji, Durst, etc.) downsample the files and you lose sharpness if you send them the large file (which most photographers do).<p>For my wedding shooting, I never need a larger file than 12 megapixels as that&#x27;s large enough for a 30x40 at 300 dpi.

It&#x27;s a clever hack to use an equivalent subset of JavaScript as an IR (accepting a few polyfills). However, it&#x27;s not exactly honest to frame it as &quot;just JavaScript.&quot;<p>What really does worry me is the ugly things that will be necessary to make asm.js genuinely viable as a platform. Yes, some proposals will have general utility for JavaScript, but many will not. And some will be downright dangerous.

Champions in DotA generally have higher burst capabilities, which can punish mistakes harder. There&#x27;s also the concept of denying minions, which add another element of micro-management to the game.<p>League of Legends on the other hand add a bit of depth to the genre by giving customisation options to champions outside of the main game (runes, masteries, summoner spell). The learning curve should be smoother, as people need to reach level 30 on their &quot;summoner&quot; (account) before they can enter ranked games. They also need to &quot;buy&quot; at least 16 champions on order to participate in ranked games. This will force the player to learn a bit of the game before entering the competitive scene.<p>Currently League of Legends is definitely the most competitive MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game around and Riot invests heavily in keeping it that way.",1373497258

Critical data needs three (or more) backups.  In my experience, one cloud provider can only ever be considered as being one backup no matter their technical architecture.<p>For example, you can&#x27;t (and in the broad &quot;you&quot;, aren&#x27;t even qualified to) audit the provider for data-loss or SLA-impacting SPOFs.  You just have to assume that they&#x27;re there.  You also take on non-technical failure modes: the provider can go out of business, get bought by an uninterested owner (think Delicious), change focus (Google Reader), or experience myriad other problems.<p>FWIW, the best success I&#x27;ve had with helping others switch to good backup policy happened once it became economically feasible to buy a new laptop and two bus-powered external drives as big as the laptop&#x27;s internal storage.  The externals become bootable backups, one of which can be preiodically rotated to an offsite location.  This has prevented severe dataloss events for myself and others far more times than I care to count now.",1373497251

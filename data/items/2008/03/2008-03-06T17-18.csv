If you find that your productivity remains high, then you probably should push through the final week.  However, if you've seen a precipitous drop in your ability to get work done, then you should take a break.  Why not start with taking 2-3 days off?  If you still don't feel like that was enough, then extend it up to 7 or more days as required.  Good luck!",1204826347

If you indeed have this great knowledge and insight that no one can replicate, then there should be absolutely nothing holding you back from telling us what this idea or field is. This would really allow us to help you in a way that is meaningful.<p>Another observation I'd like to point out is that in 6 years, you could have learned to program and done it yourself. I've learned to program and started 3 companies in the past 4 years.<p>So, my question for you is, do you really believe in this idea enough to do what it takes to make it happen? If not, then go to IBM and milk what you can of it.",1204826171

B.) using libgmailer or some other OS API 
C.) using octazen.com.<p>The octazen approach seems to take the least amount of time, which is important in this situation. The problem I was having with the octazen demo is that it was breaking on gmail accounts. When I asked their tech support what was going on they seemed to not know about the issue and asked me to try again.

When you give money to the government it basically gets stolen, whereas under cap-and-trade the money goes directly the entrepreneurs who come up with the solutions. The book is actually all about the policies that most help entrepreneurs. To quote from the introduction:<p>""A level playing field. That is what these venture capitalists and innovators require-- not assurances of profits but enough of a fighting chance to make the huge risks they are taking reasonable. Many still will not succeed. Those who do will need enormous ingenuity and doggedness to make their inventions work at a marketable price.""<p>I think most news.yc readers would actually love the book.",1204824268

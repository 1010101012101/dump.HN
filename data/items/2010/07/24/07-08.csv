After wading through an SML compiler whose author apparently thought single-letter variables and no documentation was perfectly fine in a language that doesn't even have fucking type annotations, I figured the least I could do to advance the state of the art was make the code legible.",1279958372

1543312,comment,1543057,1543274,0,0,Niten,,,"I think Perl 6's Rules are a natural and important extension to the language.  Perl has always been a tool of choice for text processing; but people tend to [ab]use regular expressions even where a real parser would be much more appropriate because their language -- Perl, Python, Ruby, C#, pretty much any commercially popular language these days -- gives you regular expressions on a platter, and their presence in the core language or standard library sort of enshrines regexes as a tool of choice.<p>Look at it this way: pretty much any ""Programming ______"" book will at least touch on that language's regexp implementation.  How many such books currently cover implementing basic parsers for non-regular grammars?<p>So yeah, if Perl 6 can bring parsers to the mainstream by providing easy, visible tools to implement them, and even simply by making parsers something you learn about in the course of learning Perl, that'll be a huge win for us all.",1279957737

Some of us do use multiple windows and tabs so we can switch our focus away from a task and return to it later.  Mozilla's user studies and large-scale data mining through Test Pilot bear this out, e.g. <a href=""http://surfmind.com/muzings/?p=505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://surfmind.com/muzings/?p=505</a> - among other things, that analysis of several thousand Firefox users found that tab opening/closing behavior among the participants followed a bimodal distribution.",1279956509
1543297,comment,1543057,1543236,0,0,expeditious,,,"One thing is that Perl 5 doesn't include by default a number of modern features that Python and Ruby have OOTB. Easy OOP, exceptions, and named function args, to name a few. If you want these things for Perl, you need to dash out to the corner store (the CPAN) for them.<p>Also, Perl 5 tends to be used for a lot of unglamorous admin work. So, although almost everyone's got a few utilities or cron tasks on their system written in Perl, they're not shouting about it from the rooftops.<p>Also, Python is an easy language to learn, and so people like to learn it and blog about how easy/nice/shiny it is: <a href=""http://xkcd.com/353/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/353/</a> .",1279956457

1543293,comment,1543057,1543236,0,0,Natsu,,,"My take is that the other languages simply supply more structure for how to do things, while Perl leaves you free to do things any which way.  Sometimes, that freedom is invaluable.  But for some people, that freedom means that they have to work to supply the structure on their own.<p>In short, I think some people feel that there are too many ways to do it.<p>Anyhow, that said, I think that people are too quick to write Perl off.  Some of us are still writing Perl.  Maybe I'm not doing anything big or fancy, but it's all documented, readable, and every single script on my computer uses warnings and strict.  If you compare Perl to duck tape, I'd be like McGuyver:  always keeping a roll of it in my pocket.",1279956090

Isn't there some reason that copy of the Economist is sitting on your desk in the first place? Presumably you do want to read the interesting articles in it, and it'd be handy if the most interesting ones were somehow brought to you.<p>Now, Tab Candy doesn't do that, but I think it's at least a step in the right direction of trying to address the cases that are somewhere between ""garbage collect the tab"" and ""immediately use the tab"".",1279955813

So there's a language for every temperament now.<p>For example, in Perl, [if you wanted to], you can roll your own object system.  That makes some people happy, and other people uncomfortable. But much of Perl has moved on to one very cool object system, Moose.<p>The Tim Bray article reads as if he's unaware of Modern Perl and all the Perl 6 stuff which has been back-ported to Perl 5.

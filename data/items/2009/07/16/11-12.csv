707676,comment,705568,705724,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"""Works"" is not the same as ""works fabulously."" Import statements and public main void() are not, in my opinion, ""fabulous"" in any way -- except possibly ""fabulously bad.""<p>I started with BASIC. I learned PERL and did some CGI stuff with it. Then I learned PHP. I used PHP for a long time, and would rate myself as expert level, especially based on writing good solid OOP code and using good OOP principles. Now, I was happy with what I could do with it... until I wasn't. It worked, but not fabulously.<p>Then I saw some Rails controller code, my jaw dropped, and I knew I had to learn it. My growth as a PHP dev had been, in retrospect, largely about mitigating the crappiness of PHP. Ruby is a different ballgame altogether.<p>I haven't had that experience with anything else since. Probably some day it will happen. But til then, the only complaint I've possibly got against Ruby/Rails/Sinatra is that deployment is not the easiest thing... and that's an ancillary problem I rarely have to deal with.<p>Most of the other things are new for the sake of being new.<p>I looked into Seaside over 2 years ago. I find it cumbersome, and I asked a question at a Seaside talk, similar to one of the other commentors here, about the templating -- which has to be done that way for the object/state serializations -- and Avi Bryant was a dick to me, to boot.<p>I'm sure it works great for what he's doing, but it doesn't appeal to me. I don't need or want to write revolutionary data transformation software. I want to write the best damn webapps for ""boring, simple"" problems that everyone else thinks are solved -- that have yet, in my mind, to ever be given a thoughtful, amazing UI.<p>So Ruby and Rails are practically custom-made for me -- and, as I said, they work fabulously.",1247743756

707656,comment,707552,707552,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Yahoo! has lost its reputation within geek circles. Google have not only put out really great products, they also go to great lengths to boast about their vastly superior technologies (BigTable, MapReduce), which gets them a lot of (well-deserved) geek love. Then there are Android and Chrome (with V8), both of which are pretty exciting to hackers. Also, Summer of Code, Code Jam etc. get Google a lot of street cred.<p>So, from a tech standpoint, Yahoo! isn't very exciting. They're still the same old portal website from the 90's. But for the average guy, Yahoo! still gives him what he needs, when he needs it.

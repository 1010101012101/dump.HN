Everyone was confused why you'd test a format by re-compressing already lossy files. I'm assuming the other shoe will drop at some point and Google will start to transparently replace transient image files served by their services (e.g. Image Search or Picasas thumbnails, maybe even map tiles) as long as your browser supports WebP. Like Opera Turbo, mobile uses probably need this more than desktop in most of the world.<p>And of course they already ship the code for WebM, which probably helps somewhat.

That is, it brings about a connotation of someone who is smart enough to succeed at most things, but who can't compete head to head with students who specialize in a specific academic field.<p>It's hard to define, but the term's usefulness comes from its general connotation and the associated imagery, not its definition.<p>I think the takeaway here is that these individuals, whatever you call them, should focus more on learning skills that will allow them to compete laterally by creating opportunities for themselves and others rather than learning to be superficially cultured or trying compete for existing opportunities head to head with others who are more specialized and talented in their respective field.",1302698588

2441861,comment,2441279,2441690,4,0,angusgr,,,"From my memories of Java ThreadLocals, these are still common/shared memory. The ThreadLocal property is a reference - a convenient way to scope access without locking - but the objects stored are still in shared memory.<p>For example, correct me if I'm wrong, but in Java if you do something like:<p><pre><code>  MyAwesomeClass myObject = new MyAwesomeClass();\n  myThreadLocal.set(myObject);\n  myOtherObject.someField = myObject;\n</code></pre>\nThen the thread local and the field value are references to the same object, in the global heap. Any thread can get to ""myOtherObject.someField"" and change my thread's local copy.<p>This specific example is probably bad design, but the underlying difference is between a shared memory design and a message passing share-nothing design, where the latter doesn't let you make that kind of mistake.<p>In Erlang the paradigm is different enough that my bad example doesn't really translate[1], but even if two similar references were made equivalent, they're to _immutable_ objects not references - so from the programmer's point of view they're never shared at all.<p>In addition, if you want to share something then you send a message so the other process (aka thread) always has their own distinct copy.<p>[1] The process dictionary is kind of the same as thread local storage, but the kind of state you'd assign via a reference on a mutable field is dealt with differently.",1302698307

Reason being, when you are applying for gigs you are competing in a deep pool with a lot of variables, while the gig is real and you have less false leads, the chances of getting selected over someone just as qualified is lower.<p>With active marketing, you get more breadth or ""surface area"" if you will, you chase more false leads, but in the end you have more exposure and are competing in a smaller pool. They have contacted you and generally have only you or a few candidates in mind for a gig. The breadth also does not leave you heavily invested if you don't get the gig, because you have other coming in all the time.<p>Finally, I like active marketing because you generally enter the project in earlier phases than applying for a posted gig. When I did market, I entered most projects at the planing phase, which I like a lot more than at the build phase, as it gives me an opportunity to address items at that point instead of telling the client at the point that they are ready to build, that they need to go back and redesign stuff.<p>Now days, Euro and IBM take up all of my and my teams time, so we have not marketed for work in years, any specifics I would give would be rusty.

2441848,comment,2440432,2440638,7,0,pygy_,,,"I have some suggestions that could help regulate the current issues.<p>I'd change the way the karma is calculated in order to reward people who are consistently good rather than heavy posters. I suggest using the geometric mean of the post scores.<p>As such, you wouldn't have to give a karma penalty to comment. A weak comment would reduce the karma automatically.<p>I recommend the geometric mean since the scores are most likely Zipf-distributed. It could be calculated in the background as a running arithmetic mean of the logarithm of the scores, which shouldn't be too expensive.<p>I'd display the karma not as an absolute number, but as color-coded rectangle. The color would be based on percentile of the score described above, or perhaps as a function of this percentile. The post count (or better, the post frequency) of the user could be represented as the length of the rectangle. You could then display this ""badge"" next to the user name in threads. Since it would be a continuous thing, it would not divide the comunity in have and have nots as the badge system introduced and retracted earlier. In order not to discourage people from posting, users below a certain threshold (say the 50th or 60th percentile) would all have the same value displayed.<p>I'd also grant the various rights based on the basis of the percentile rather than based on hard numbers.<p>Every time a new right is granted, users should get guidelines on how to use it, i.e. don't upvote based on agreement, don't downvote unless the post is offensive/shallow.<p>Commenting in topics with little points could perhaps weight more than commenting in threads with a big score. This would encourage posting in less popular threads.<p>Downvoting should cost karma. This could be implemented as a comment with a low score. You'd keep two counts: a post count and a downvote count. The karma would be calculated based on the sum of these numbers, but the post count would still be displayed. The value of a downvote would be calculated according to the number of post, otherwise it would cost less to people with lots of comments/votes. The karma of the voter may also be taken into account.<p>The up and down votes should be weighted as a function of the karma of the voter. They could be implemented as a floating point number.<p>Removing the number of votes per post prevents to detect a highly upvoted answer to a little upvoted comment. If the votes are weighted as described above, the vote count has little meaning anyway, but the post score could still be displayed in a meaningful way by using a color-coded system similar to the one described for the karma.<p>I'd suggest two distinct scores<p><pre><code>    log( comment score ) / log( highest score in the thread )\n    log( comment score ) / log( highest score ever at the time of thread submission )\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these could be calculated in javascript on the client. The real score could still be extracted with a browser extension, but I don't think it matters much.<p>Making the first value relative to the max score at the time of voting would allow that value remains relevant as time passes, even if the community grows or shrinks. It would require to add a ""max score"" field to submissions, though.",1302698155

2441751,story,,,1,1,sebkomianos,"Graduating from an average university, should I do a MSc or work in a startup?",,"My first question to the Hacker News community, I hope I am not doing anything wrong. :)<p>So, the situation is like this: I am 22 years old, I study Computer Science at Royal Holloway, a college of the University of London and I am graduating this July. When I first got admitted to university I was planning to become an academic. Now, all I want is to finish with my exams and...go out there.<p>Now, there are three main problems with that:<p>1. I am most probably going to graduate with a high 2:1 (an average mark between 65% and 70%) from an ""average"" institution so I suppose that this may be a weak point in my applications for jobs.<p>2. I don't have any major work/project to show to places where I apply. As with my skillset, they are limited to what I was asked to do/study at university. I can obviously work on this issue after I graduate but since then my applications aren't going to be as ""rich"" as I'd like them to be.<p>3. I don't know if that's the ""right"" thing to do. I am disappointed with higher education in the UK and this is making me feel that doing a Masters will not really help me (apart from giving me another qualification in papers, that is -yes, I am one of those that believe higher education is overrated-). Also, because of that, I feel tired even when I am just thinking about MSc studies.<p>Which brings me to my question: Do you reckon that it's better I do a Masters (even at a ""yet another average university"") or should I really give it a go, build something and apply for every position I find interesting? Is ""actual work experience"" going to be be more helpful than a MSc from a university like, say, UCL or Imperial? What do most people ask for when they look to hire someone? What's better for us as individuals?",1302696496

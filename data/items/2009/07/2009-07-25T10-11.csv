In doing so the playful scientists encoded the phrase ""I am the riddle of life, solve me!"" into junk DNA sections of the organism.... it always made me feel a little queasy thinking about it being found by whatever civilization is around a thousand years from now! What would it do to their fundamental picture of life? I'm sure the same could be said about organic computation. It's an open-ended chaotic system, where really all we control is the initial starting conditions. Who's to know that after we've got our ""answer"" the continued adaptation leads to something vastly beyond our control/comprehension. I guess it's all part of the ""ghost in the machine"" paranoia surrounding AI, except these things will not be ghosts and the machine is DNA.....<p></alarmist diatribe>",1248519494

723157,comment,723140,723140,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""Another example is the ESP experiments of Mr. Rhine, and other people. As various people have made criticisms--and they themselves have made criticisms of their own experiments--they improve the techniques so that the effects are smaller, and smaller, and smaller until they gradually disappear. All the parapsychologists are looking for some experiment that can be repeated--that you can do again and get the same effect--statistically, even. They run a million rats no, it’s people this time they do a lot of things and get a certain statistical effect. Next time they try it they don’t get it any more. And now you find a man saying that it is an irrelevant demand to expect a repeatable experiment. This is science?""<p>Feynman noticed the scientific procedure problems in parapsychology ""research,"" and later investigators responded to his suggestion to be better research by carefully debunking claims about ESP research.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Alpha"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Alpha</a>",1248518711

  Fact: News will exist after newspapers.

The ""news industry"" has never been in the business of creating anything.  They were simply in the ""fact distribution"" business.  Facts used to travel more efficiently via the newspaper than any other means (gossip, telephone, even television).  But now that distribution costs on the internet are virtually nil, they can no longer make money by exploiting inefficiencies.<p>This is the reason that Simon's plan is never going to work. If they try it, they'll go out of business just that much sooner.<p>There are publications that still make money off subscriptions.  The Economist is the shining example (I even subscribe, for a pretty substantial fee).

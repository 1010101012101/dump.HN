8938147,comment,8928433,8936127,0,0,iopq,,,"What? By your definition object orientation is a &quot;framework&quot; because it &quot;helps you structure code&quot; and is &quot;a set of conventions that are optionally enforced by code&quot;. That&#x27;s not a framework, that&#x27;s a paradigm!<p>If a framework doesn&#x27;t do something implicitly it&#x27;s just a large library. If it&#x27;s a set of conventions not backed by baked-in logic, it&#x27;s a style guide.<p>A framework must CALL YOU. It usually gives you a piece of code that loads itself and lets you customize what it does by passing your code/configs to it. Then you tell it to run with what you gave it. The parts of the framework that you call yourself are actually &quot;plug-ins&quot; or basically framework-specific libraries.<p>If the framework never calls your code and you only call into the framework, that&#x27;s always just a library. I would argue that actually it&#x27;s easier to conflate a very full-featured library with a microframework because both really kind of call your code (especially when it&#x27;s in the form of closures or a DSL).<p>You would never accidentally call a framework a library, though, because it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s handling things for you. It&#x27;s running everything behind the scenes and you just kind of advise it to do the things you want.",1422057430

I can still defend it without incoherence on other grounds. Just because in some jurisdictions you have to use copyright to defend those rights, that doesn&#x27;t make those rights <i>dependent</i> on accepting copyright.<p>For example, here in civil law countries, there&#x27;s commonly no &quot;copyright&quot; as such; there&#x27;s Moral Rights (which protect stuff like attribution) and Economic Rights. Therefore,  there&#x27;s no implication that abolishing Economic Rights like restricting others from copying must also abolish attribution rights.<p>Essentially, the attribution right is the goal, and copyright is just a method that can be used to achieve that goal. There&#x27;s no incoherence in defending the goal without supporting this method of achieving it.<p>And that applies to the GPL as well - I can defend the right to prevent others from using your code in closed binaries, without having to defend the wider right of prevent any copying at all.

Conceptually, the way it schedules packet transmissions over time turns out to be quite efficient (at least in WLANs scenarios), even though this efficiency is somewhat reduced with newer and faster PHY layers (packets transmission being faster, the time spent in backoff to avoid collisions increases the overhead).<p>From an engineering point of view, my personal opinion is that the fact that 802.11 operates in a completely decentralized way is probably more desirable than having a more complicated solution that would require AP-to-AP communication but would most likely provide only marginal gains (several researchers have shown the close-to-optimal nature of purely decentralized CSMA-style scheduling).
In case of spectrum assignment, it can benefit from AP-to-AP communication, especially if you want or need to enforce particular optimization criteria, such as maximizing throughput or fairness (I&#x27;ve personally experimented with that kind of algorithms as well).

The very basis (PC) of their core franchines (Windows and Office) is in decline. It looks like a business that is past its prime.<p>Can Microsoft reverse this? It&#x27;s hard for them, because they are so successful. Most other successes look small: e.g. their incredible and profitable xbox business isn&#x27;t in the same league. To rejuvenate themselves would be like Google coming up with a better business than adwords, or xerox a better business than copiers.

Windows still has a huge amount of software for it, and businesses rely on it. They also rely on Office. Phones and tablets have not really began to displace these business roles. Microsoft has made Office for them anyway; and it also has Windows for tablet (on Intel). <i>These won&#x27;t displace current phones/tablets</i> - but they will enable businesses to keep using their software and Office.<p>Of course, there is an opportunity for new ways to serve businesses, using mobile devices, that will make the old Windows software obsolete.

It was a thing for the Times magazine&#x27;s 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.</i><p><i>But the main point is that I don&#x27;t claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it&#x27;s technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That&#x27;s a very different kind of question.</i><p><i>And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don&#x27;t get this point -- that they&#x27;re confusing technology with monetary economics.</i> -- Krugman, Business Insider Letter [<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-internet-quote-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-krugman-responds-to-inte...</a>]",1422055284

That is a pretty classic and well used content service feature for attracting new customers, only the content service decides what to give away for free, and what to charge for, not the artist. And if you read closely the original article Zoe said she had to put it on Google&#x27;s service at the exact same time she did <i>anywhere</i> else. This is a huge loss in marketing leverage for a small artist because she loses the ability to have a special &quot;fan release&quot; that she can get out early to fans to subscribe to her own version of an affinity service.<p>So lets say she produces an awesome track, and her fans are all abuzz because they hear it first. It pulls people on the edge into the fan subscription service.<p>But with this arrangement all of that marketing leverage is ceded to Google. They might decide to put her best paying track on the &#x27;free&#x27; side to highlight great indie artist tunes on the &#x27;pay&#x27; side. She loses her best source of revenue and Google gets to push some people over the edge into paying for their streaming service.<p>Artistic content, whether it is games, movies, music, or books, has a strong &#x27;freshness&#x27; peak in value when it first comes out and then tapers off rapidly. Collecting that value is fundamental to the economics of information, that is why there are &quot;exclusive&quot; stories and &quot;sneak previews&quot;.<p>Google is requesting that artists cede that value over to them in order to participate on Youtube. In my opinion, that is an exceptionally high price to pay.",1422055138

8937993,comment,8933562,8933562,0,0,wmyl,,,"&quot;Our Enemy, The State&quot;, by Albert J. Nock - 1935. CHAPTER 4
=====================================================
AFTER conquest and confiscation have been effected, and the State set up, its first concern is with the land. The State assumes the right of eminent domain over its territorial basis, whereby every landholder becomes in theory a tenant of the State. In its capacity as ultimate landlord, the State distributes the land among its beneficiaries on its own terms. A point to be observed in passing is that by the State-system of land-tenure each original transaction confers two distinct monopolies, entirely different in their nature, inasmuch as one concerns the right to labour-made property, and the other concerns the right to purely law-made property. The one is a monopoly of the use-value of land; and the other, a monopoly of the economic rent of land. The first gives the right to keep other persons from using the land in question, or trespassing on it, and the right to exclusive possession of values accruing from the application of labour to it; values, that is, which are produced by exercise of the economic means upon the particular property in question. Monopoly of economic rent, on the other hand, gives the exclusive right to values accruing from the desire of other persons to possess that property; values which take their rise irrespective of any exercise of the economic means on the part of the holder.[1]<p>Economic rent arises when, for whatsoever reason, two or more persons compete for the possession of a piece of land, and it increases directly according to the number of persons competing. The whole of Manhattan Island was bought originally by a handful of Hollanders from a handful of Indians for twenty-four dollars&#x27; worth of trinkets. The subsequent &quot;rise in land-values,&quot; as we call it, was brought about by the steady influx of population and the consequent high competition for portions of the island&#x27;s surface; and these ensuing values were monopolized by the holders. They grew to an enormous size, and the holders profited accordingly; the Astor, Wendel, and Trinity Church estates have always served as classical examples for study of the State-system of land-tenure.",1422054918

Krugman in the early 2000&#x27;s was as far away from the seat of power as humanly possible, he had 0 impact on policy in the Bush administration.<p>Just look at how the quotes are represented on HN:<p><pre><code>    &quot;To fight this recession the Fed needs…soaring
    household spending to offset moribund business 
    investment. [So] Alan Greenspan needs to create a 
    housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble.&quot;
</code></pre>
Compared to what was actually said:<p><pre><code>    &quot;The basic point is that the recession of 2001 wasn&#x27;t a 
    typical postwar slump, brought on when an inflation-
    fighting Fed raises interest rates and easily ended by a 
    snapback in housing and consumer spending when the
    Fed brings rates back down again.

    This was a prewar-style recession, a morning-after
    brought on by irrational exuberance. To fight this
    recession the Fed needs more than a snapback; it needs
    soaring household spending to offset moribund business
    investment. And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put
    it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to 
    replace the Nasdaq bubble.&quot;
</code></pre>
He went on to describe why he thinks Greenspan will try to create a housing bubble:<p><pre><code>    Bear in mind also that government officials have a stake in
    accentuating the positive. The administration needs a
    recovery because, with deficits exploding, the only way it
    can justify that tax cut is by pretending that it was just what
    the economy needed. Mr. Greenspan needs one to avoid 
    awkward questions about his own role in creating the
    stock market bubble.
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m at a loss how someone can read &quot;Greenspan will create a housing bubble because he&#x27;s in bed with the administration and they need to justify the huge tax cuts that haven&#x27;t stimulated the economy and distract from the Fed&#x27;s role in the stock bubble&quot; and then think that was a policy recommendation and not a prescient critique of a bumbling economic policy.",1422054352

Much of this work has been in PHP, often using the CodeIgniter framework [1]. As far as PHP goes, I do like CI; it provides some semblance of an MVC environment, a predictable URL/parameter routing scheme, view templates, and so on. I have a CI custom controller I inherit from to publish my REST endpoints. Generally CI projects will tend toward a somewhat common/predictable structure, enhancing maintainability and team development.<p>But over the years I&#x27;ve also inherited some absolutely abhorrent PHP nightmare projects, whose design/coding decisions truly boggle the imagination. Often based on no framework at all, and apparently motivated largely by the developer&#x27;s desire to use as many PHP and SQL features as possible in the same project.<p>Latterly I&#x27;ve been using python for some web projects. I played briefly with django, but I&#x27;ve found myself settling on Flask [2], a very nice &quot;microframework&quot; which is super easy to get running with, and which gives a great balance between power and stay-out-of-my-way-ness. It has a simple URL routing system based on function decorators and regex, the ability to factor your apps into reusable components based around your python modules, jinja2 templates, etc. I use sqlalchemy for db access.<p>Honestly I find it much more of a pleasure to be coding python/flask vs PHP/codeigniter, but due to team and project constraints it isn&#x27;t always possible to go that way.<p>[1] <a href=""https://ellislab.com/codeigniter/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ellislab.com/codeigniter/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/</a>",1422054278

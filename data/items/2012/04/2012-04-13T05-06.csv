There's tons of potential with this, as it could be extended to assign tasks to specific projects, assign priorities, and set task due dates and gcal integration.<p>Do any email protocols accept XML or JSON?

That seems easy for a human to carry out and for a machine to recognize.  This seems to address your objection:<p><i>In this perfect world this supposedly is done by the sender... but that, too, is fraught with problems, because that takes a certain level of skill on the sender side and now you've lost the aspect of email where you just click ""New Email"", bash on the keyboard for a bit, and hit ""Send""</i><p>It is indeed possible to define little machine interfaces like this and for users to learn and use them.  A more complicated interface would of course be more difficult; maybe you would only try to ask technical users to do that, and have a machine send back ""Did not parse correctly"" if it did not parse correctly.  If it becomes common and useful enough, perhaps you could make email applications that provided buttons or whatever to machine-generate machine-readable instructions, and big-business clients could instruct their employees that deal with your machine to use such an application.  And maybe you could bug Gmail developers into implementing it as an optional feature, disabled by default--maybe in that ""Gmail Labs"" thing, although this has a different source.  If that doesn't work, then maybe you could duplicate all of Gmail's nice functionality so that those employees feel fine using your email application.  <i>Eventually</i> you might get something that could be called a standard out of this, but you would start with just a small use case.<p>It does seem likely that expecting an interface to work with <i>no</i> prior exchange of instructions (""put word in subject"") between the receiver and the sender is, well, <i>hubris</i>.  But I suspect you can get a fair amount done with tiny interfaces that are easy to learn.

The evacuation plan which led to the population growth of Israel was invented by Irgun commander Ze'ev Jabotinsky. The sixth prime minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, was also a commander in Irgun. Irgun and Lehi led to Herut, which is now the modern controlling Likud party in Israel. Lehi also had Yitzhak Shamir who became prime minister in the 1980s.<p>Lehi is famous for the Ankara document which proposed a pact with Nazi Germany to help start a totalitarian state (their words) in Palestine, to fulfill Zionism. They sponsored multiple sabotage and espionage operations against the British and in the Middle East.  They were instrumental later in the invasion of Iran in 1942.<p>Lehi assassinated politicians in Britain and was described as a terrorist organization by the British authorities.<p>Irgun is an even easier case to make. Its motto: a hand holding a rifle with the words ""only thus"" underneath it. It was self-described as a terrorist organization by spokespeople from it at the time (1940s) and openly spoke of terrorism as the <i>only</i> effective way for a Zionist state.<p>So yes, Israel exists because of terrorism and is deeply rooted in it at a fundamental basis.<p>The whole point is that to point out that the current political manifestation known as Israel is a danger for the geopolitical stability of the region is actually a valid observation that historians will see as clear as day in 500 years.

Timothy Leary, whom Nixon described as the most dangerous man in America due to his immense countercultural influence, was a Harvard lecturer. Ted Kaczynski (better known as the Unabomber) was accepted there at age 16 for his undergraduate degree, later became an assistant professor at Berkeley, and has inspired a whole generation of ecoterrorists and neo-luddites. And what about all the free software/open source advocates that came out of buttoned-down tech schools like MIT, including Richard Stallman?",1334293800

3835479,comment,3808545,3808545,1,0,mjs00,,,"Most startups will not have a 'copywriter'. I've typically seen product or marketing copy from the following functions with the following related issues:<p>1) Developers: accurate description of product | too verbose/features rather than benefits
2) Non-technical marketing: grammatically correct | disconnected features/benefits/lack of story/too much 'sell'
3) Contract writers: Good story | expensive and time consuming to get writer to point of understanding<p>The best sites I feel do a good job of understanding what the company's 'secret sauce' is (often what is missing - the sustainable/differentiable/competitive advantage). They have a simple/compelling narrative connecting potential users with the benefits and key features of the solution. And it's usually a very healthy amount of back/forth between 1-2 or 1-3 to get there.<p>If you don't get any bites on your request, you might consider expanding on what you feel the 'thorn' is. Are you technical, and need help crafting a compelling story? Or do you enjoy writing but are having a hard time extracting benefits and a story from a list of features?",1334293576

I don't know that you're generally morally repugnant; we might agree on nearly everything.  But we disagree viciously on this point.<p>I don't care if an individual got the equity as a founder, an investor, an employee, an advisor, or a partner.  Once they've earned the equity, they're free to do what they'd like with it, even if it's not what I'd prefer.  I can't accept your arguments to the contrary.<p>And frankly, I think it'd be a very unprofessional employee who'd be so bothered by an individual's personal asset allocation choices that they'd refer to it as having a charity inflicted upon them, simply because you provided a portion of the labor that increased the value of the securities.",1334293472

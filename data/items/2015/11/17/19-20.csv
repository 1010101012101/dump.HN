There is a constant moralizing about fat people in our culture, like if you&#x27;re fat you&#x27;re lazy or bad or whatever, none of which is warranted.<p>But I think that&#x27;s where things get muddled--culture turns fatness into a moral failing, wrapped under a sheath of health concern trolling.

The downside to that is that if you change your views or become less passionate, the people may tend to isolate from you. Same thing for when you have friends from work. However, you can try to turn these more superficial friendships into more meaningful ones by talking about people&#x27;s kids, dating life, childhood, etc. Once you talk about things that are more intimate, people will view you as a more intimate friend than you actually are. And remember you have to &quot;give to get&quot; - so talk about yourself and share details that push the boundary of your intimacy level (not in a creepy way).

It&#x27;s no wonder to me at all that a vast majority of people regardless of their current size have zero idea what to do to eat healthily.<p>I became interested in the Health At Every Size movement during its inception as part of recovering from an eating disorder and, at its core when it was first started, it had a very positive message- essentially &quot;Hey, everyone, let&#x27;s promote the idea that we all should eat healthy food and get exercise and do fun active stuff regardless of if we&#x27;re fat or thin or old or young or tall or short.&quot; It was a direct challenge to the idea that you had to be a particular size to be active or to go to the gym or to do active hobbies. However very soon after inception it was perverted into a message of &quot;It is entirely possible to be healthy regardless of how fat you get and if you are fat and your doctor says that you are not healthy because you are fat then it is your doctor who is wrong because it&#x27;s never, ever wrong to be fat, ever.&quot;<p>Message #1 was great as it was all about promoting eating healthier regardless of your size, getting regular exercise that was fun and that you enjoyed doing regardless of your size, and about being gentle with yourself during that process- so stepping away from hating yourself because you were fat and instead doing something productive with that brainpower. Message #2 corrupted that into &quot;You are perfect <i>because</i> you are fat and if anyone tells you that you should be less fat then they&#x27;re trying to abuse you and make you change to suit them.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m extremely excited about the nutritional research that&#x27;s coming out regarding gut microbes and their potential impact on our health and weight because I imagine how awesome it&#x27;d be to go to your doctor, spit in a cup, and have it tell you what all you should and shouldn&#x27;t be eating (due to genetics, microbes, etc) as well as recommend which probiotic you should be taking to get your gut bacteria in line.",1447789685

Boss&#x27;s responsibility is to think very thoroughly about how work is to be done, and worker&#x27;s responsibility is to do <i>exactly</i> as told. In Taylor&#x27;s work it goes as far as to dictate how ofter and for how long workers are to take breaks (so the maximum amount of labor can be extracted from them without exhausting their muscles <i>before</i> the end of the shift).<p>To complete your list, empiricism and work ethic are the tactics that are to be used to apply all that management&#x27;s brain power; efficiency and elimination of waste are the end results; and standardization and best practices are the institutionalization of those end results so that the manager&#x27;s enlightened intelligence can move on to &quot;fine tune&quot; the next process in the assembly line.<p>I am not saying that there is no use of standards and best practices. If anything, in the software industry we need to be more strict, not less, about the best practices we already know and have known for several decades. But there is a big difference between that and the kind of micromanagement that this kind of tools elicit in practice.<p>i.e. Professional athletes do need to drill until individual movements become second nature, and proper technique matters a lot if you are competing at the highest levels. But you do not see coaches trying to dictate what each player will do on every conceivable situation. Even in extremely structured sports, like football, the coach dictate a general strategy and changes tactics according to the dynamics of the game, but each individual player needs to apply a minimum of discretionary judgment to react to situations that arise mid-play.<p>A coach that tried to move his players like puppets would be crushed by the competition.

In many such views (including the long-standing view of the Catholic Church) it is one of the two main sources of the faith, alongside sacred tradition.<p>The idea that the Bible is the <i>sole</i> source of Christian truth, or that it is entirely literal, are novel and minority opinions within Christianity. (The groups holding them are more relatively prominent in the US, and definitely more political prominent in the US, compared to other Christian groups than they are globally within Christianity, but even so there are quite large segments of <i>American</i> Christianity that don&#x27;t follow these relatively newfangled approaches.)<p>> How is this process of picking and choiceing from the Bible and 2000 years of Christian history not the same as making up your own morality<p>Everyone is using their conscience to make their own decisions about morality, even literalists. That they choose to accept what someone tells them the canon is (about which there are disagreements among Christians -- and the canon favored by literalists is, like literalism itself, a recent change from the historical canon), and to accept that someone tells them the canon must be approached literally, and to accept the authority of a particular version or translation of the canon to be taken literally, and to then either choose their own or choose to take someone else&#x27;s guidance on how to read the amibiguities are contradictions that arise when the text is viewed literally -- all of those are choices. Its kind of dangerous to think that the decision to delegate accept someone else&#x27;s word for how to make these choices stops them from <i>being</i> choices.<p>Christianity, whether with or without literalism, doesn&#x27;t evade the need to make decisions about morality.<p>> Seems to me, that the only thing &#x27;being Christian&#x27; is (outside of the institution), is that you take some more of your morality from the Bible compared to all other books.<p>Except for those holding to a rather extreme version of the (also new) doctrine of <i>sola scriptura</i>, Christian&#x27;s don&#x27;t generally believe that <i>books</i> (whether one or many) are the sole source of morals.<p>> Why not just go all the way and look at all books and history to make up your own morality?<p>What stops someone from being Christian who considers all sources (not just books) in informing their conscience. Note that neither the Nicene nor Apostle&#x27;s Creed -- generally held by mainstream Christians as the uniting features of Christianity -- makes more than a passing reference to Scripture (and that only in regard to the alignment between it and Christ&#x27;s Passion.)<p>What keeps someone Christian -- or fails to, if it withers -- is their belief in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Trinity, not their dedication to a book.",1447789435

Earlier this year I read an article highlighting just how extraordinarily rare it is to overcome morbid obesity in adulthood and maintain this progress indefinitely without medical intervention. Ultimately, we need to accept that our bodies, including the organ which gives rise to our behavior, are physical systems subject to occurrences entirely beyond our conscious control.<p>I&#x27;ve not dealt with obesity personally, but I would speculate that many of the people who enjoy &quot;fat shaming&quot; are unfamiliar with the experience of having internal conflicts which lead one to take actions that are obviously irrational, even to the person performing them. This is an area where more empathy would lead to greater mutual understanding and perhaps increase the probability of finding solutions. (Of course, finding this empathy is perhaps a similar challenge.)",1447789294
10583460,comment,10574243,10581660,0,0,gh02t,,,"This is where you get into the nitty-gritty (and stupidly difficult) type of parallel algorithms. When you have e.g. cells that are dependent on their neighbors you can no longer use the trivial divide-and-conquer strategy.<p>Usually the strategy is to break the domain into chunks, with each chunk being multiple cells. Inside the chunk, the processor already has the data for adjacent cells so it can just read it. On the boundaries where some of the adjacent cells are in another chunk and on a different processor, it has to ask for the data... the vast majority of scientific codes here use OpenMP (not so bad, shared memory) or MPI (absolutely miserable to use IMO, but powerful distributed memory) to communicate. There&#x27;s other tools for the job that are nicer than MPI, but they don&#x27;t get much attention from HPC people (who tend to be <i>very</i> conservative with new technology, especially &quot;high-level&quot; abstractions).<p>Inter-processor communication is orders of magnitude slower than querying local memory (especially if that processor is say on another machine), so on top of that there&#x27;s lots of clever methods of what is essentially figuring out how to slice up the problem domain; examples include Red-Black schemes, domain decomposition and Wavefront propagation.<p>To answer your question specifically on boundary conditions (and here I&#x27;m talking about the edges of the whole image where there&#x27;s literally nothing in some cells nearby, not boundaries between partitioned regions like I was above)... you just have to choose something. There are three common approaches, which I&#x27;ll illustrate by imagining you&#x27;re doing a blur that decides how to blur a pixel by looking at the 8 pixels that surround it and that you&#x27;re on the far <i>right</i> edge of the image (so the right three neighboring pixels would lie outside the image):<p>1. Zero - treat the three pixels as black/zero when calculating. Equivalently, treat them as whatever arbitrary value you find works best (e.g. white/1).<p>2. Reflective - treat the three pixels as whatever value the pixels on the left side at the appropriate positions would be. That is to say, wrap around to the other side.<p>3. Symmetric - treat the right three pixels as if they were the same as the left three (or the center three if you like).<p>This is a common problem also when solving something like a differential equation on a discretized spatial grid. In this case, the edge values are determined based on your boundary conditions- method 1 corresponds to vacuum boundaries, 2. corresponds to periodic boundaries and 3. is a specific type of extrapolated boundary.",1447789287

But I think it might be a little disingenuous to use Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s crypto practices as an example. I believe this is the more interesting story of what really happened with Bin Laden?<p>>Pakistan secretly captures Bin Laden by bribing tribesmen. The US finds out by bribing Pakistani officials. Further bribes with foreign aid money get other Pakistani officials to issue a stand down order. The SEALS swoop in unopposed but somehow still lose a helicopter. They kill a captive Bin Laden as part of a deal to avoid exposing Saudi support for Al Qaeda. The media gets fed a cover story about the compound being a command center. Some doctor guy becomes a scapegoat and vaccination programs are derailed in all of Pakistan. The CIA fabricates documents from the compound and flirts with claiming credit for &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; technique in the matter.<p>If you don&#x27;t like that story then sure by all means stick with Story A: The CIA does brilliant investigative work. The commander-in-chief makes a gutsy call. The SEALs storm in and kill the bad guy in a firefight. He is buried at sea with full rituals. The 2012 presidential campaign starts a few days afterwards.<p>If you support Story A, then this would certainly make sense:<p>>It&#x27;s like they simply forgot about the biggest reason it took so long to find Osama bin Laden: he was so security-concerned that he used couriers and relays (which, counter to the broad narrative about the terrorist shift to security, actually cannot be decrypted)<p>##EDIT<p>Claims comes from a previous HN article about the Killing of Bin Laden: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9520984"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9520984</a>",1447788619

What you spend on extra real-estate is easily more than made up for with increased productivity, less sick time, fewer superficial conversations, etc., even over times spans as short as 1 year.<p>I think even in large cities, open-plan madness is still cargo cult and more about fashion and subtle ageism than it is about the economic costs of real estate. There&#x27;s also some weird patriarchal aspects of it too, especially in financial companies where the offices and workflow are almost engineered to be like a Panopticon. I always enjoyed reading Joel Spolsky on his choice to commit to having private offices even in Manhattan, both for Fog Creek and later for Stack Exchange.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are cases where a company is strapped for cash, or where they need to be located in an extremely expensive part of SF/Manhattan/London/etc. If someone really used hard numbers to justify it, I&#x27;d have no problem with it. But the problem is nobody&#x27;s using numbers. It&#x27;s about fashion, signalling, and control.<p>I worked for an established education technology company that had offices all over. They bought a fancy new loft space in the Boston area and decked it out just like a SV stereotype: glass whiteboards everywhere, bean bag chairs, video games, gourmet coffee. The open seating was awful -- you had about 4 lateral feet of personal space, and your computer monitor practically bumped into the monitor of your neighbor on either side. There was effectively zero privacy. It was even hard just put a notepad of paper on my desk-slice and try to draw some ideas or take notes.<p>The company actually <i>spent</i> money, like > $10MM, to renovate their Columbus, OH, office to look the same. <i>They didn&#x27;t even have an engineering presence in Columbus.</i> The people there were all veteran employees mostly within the HR, business, and regional sales departments. They all had private offices for years and were extremely productive with them, and also felt they had earned the right to work in offices given that many of them had long tenures with the company.<p>And the company <i>paid money</i> to remodel the whole office. <i>They actively destroyed privacy features that directly created productive and happy workers, and spent money to do so.</i><p>When I did my exit interview at the company, I spoke with one of those HR reps in Columbus and talked a lot about my frustration with the Boston office&#x27;s open layout. She shared my sentiment and lamented how, at her age and her rank in the firm, it was extremely frustrating to be placed back into a fully open-plan office and have no privacy to conduct calls or spread out her work materials and get things done.<p>I asked her why the company chose to do it, and all she could say was that they had recently hired a new CTO for a major sub-division in the firm, and that CTO brought in sweeping changes that were meant to &quot;modernize&quot; the company, and specifically he decreed that all of the offices needed to be remodeled to have open-plan layouts because &quot;that&#x27;s what engineers want.&quot;<p>And this was in a huge company, where presumably these kind of remodeling choices would have to be debated by committees, face political opposition from other parts of the company, etc. It was just insane.",1447787743

That is the difference between a wannabe inventor and an inventor.  In short, if you don&#x27;t yet know &#x27;how it does it&#x27;, you don&#x27;t really have anything to keep secret yet. Now sure, some ideas are so simple that once you know what it is, figuring out how to do it is child&#x27;s play.  But I note that you didn&#x27;t reveal an example of a new eating utensil (which could be really cool), but instead you revealed a type-on-air keyboard which probably has non-trivial development costs and risks. How it works is worth protecting in that case.<p>Investment has different levels of risk and reward.  Inventions which have not yet been reduced to practice are very high risk.  If you can&#x27;t attract investment at the current level of perceived risk, you ought to do what you can to drive out risk or show that the risk is lower than perceived. This usually means doing much of the development on your own (typical garage inventor) or establishing a good business case for paying the development costs (finding the customer before development).<p>I don&#x27;t know if creativity can be taught or not.  I have had classes on creativity, and some of the people who come out of those classes are quite creative.  On the other hand, I have also had classes on math, and a few of the people who come out of those classes can do math.

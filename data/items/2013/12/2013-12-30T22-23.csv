6987669,comment,6985207,6986864,6,0,keyme,,,"> you would use byte strings and you would never have to call encode or touch UTF-8 before passing the byte string to a TCP socket.<p>I&#x27;ll start by adding that it&#x27;s also incredibly annoying to declare each string to be a byte string, if this wasn&#x27;t clear from my original rant.<p>Additionally, your advice is broken. Take a look at this example, with the shelve module (from standard library).<p>s=shelve.open(&#x27;/tmp/a&#x27;)<p>s[b&#x27;key&#x27;]=1<p>Results in:<p>AttributeError: &#x27;bytes&#x27; object has no attribute &#x27;encode&#x27;<p>So in this case, my byte string can&#x27;t be used as a key here, apparently. Of course, a string is expected, and this isn&#x27;t really a string. My use case was trying to use a binary representation of a hash as the key here. What&#x27;s more natural than that. Could easily do that in Python 2. Not so easy now.<p>I can find endless examples for this, so your advice about &quot;just using byte strings&quot; is invalid. Conversions are inevitable. And this annoys me.<p>> What you&#x27;re saying about Unicode scares me.<p>Yeah, I know full well what you&#x27;re scared of. If I&#x27;m designing everything from scratch, using Unicode properly is easy. This, however, is not the case when implementing existing protocols, or reading file formats that don&#x27;t use Unicode. That&#x27;s where things begin being annoying when your strings are no longer strings.",1388444392

What&#x27;s more, bypassing the ID requirement is trivial for criminals, in the same way that bored teenagers can purchase alcohol whenever they want because forging ID cards is easy.<p>Note also that IDs are actually not required for flying in the US.

It sounds like she&#x27;s quite talented and had a choice available to her in the marketplace. Based on her market research she went with what she believed to be the better option for her situation. It&#x27;s possible that she may have decided to go against her instincts and research and go with YCombinator anyway but it&#x27;s odd to argue that she should have <i>taken the risk</i> and done it over her preferred solution. These are very big decisions involving where you live in the short term and how your life turns out in the long run. The onus really is on YC to address the perceived or real notion in the marketplace (that it&#x27;s not female founder friendly) to continue to attract the best startups. That is, if there is an onus on any party here it&#x27;s not on the buyer but rather the seller to address these issues. If these notions are false and unfounded it won&#x27;t be too hard to clear them up. If they&#x27;re based on something that does have a grain of truth then go tackle that.

Why do Paypal don’t check the blockchain in any way to check that a bitcoin transaction between a merchant and the client has taken place ?<p>Do Paypal plan to make such a service soon in the future ? Maybe by recording the merchant wallet address as well as the client’s address? This way, Paypal would be able to check for the bitcoins transactions (using said blockchain, as in http://www.blockchain.info ) and then allow or disallow the chargeback to happen.<p>Do you know why the credit card payments such as Visa, Mastercard, are not used by merchant to sell bitcoins ?

I rarely pay for these out of my own pocket.<p>- Being a smaller operation your pilot can be very young and inexperienced.<p>- These planes are very small and at times get uncomfortably hot in the summer.<p>- The majority of crashes around here are from similarly sized aircraft. Always an uncomfortable reminder of what can go wrong.<p>- Flying in any kind of adverse weather can honestly be pretty terrifying in a smaller plane. If your lucky they&#x27;ll delay or cancel it altogether.<p>- Sometimes your pilot will leave the window open and a wasp will fly in prior to take off.

YCombinator has a great reputation as the best startup incubator and it&#x27;s founders have sterling reputations as being the people you absolutely need to talk to if you&#x27;re considering a tech startup. It takes a lifetime to become known as superlative, the proverbial gold standard. It&#x27;s as true on the mean streets as it is in the halls of power: You are what people think you are.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where this &quot;frat house&quot; thing comes from (scare quotes, not direct quotation). Have you ever been to a frat house? Believe me, they have nothing in common with a summer at YCombinator. I&#x27;ve described yc dinners as being &quot;like a high school lunchroom where everyone is happy to see you and every table is the cool kid&#x27;s table&quot;. Women are utterly and completely welcome. Minorities are welcome. Bring them your nerds, your socially inept, your ambitious hackers yearning to be free. Frat houses are all about pecking orders and childish humor. YC is genuinely about mutual support and an open exchange of ideas.<p>If &quot;frat house&quot; means that there aren&#x27;t many women present, I can only guess as to why. There are a variety of social and cultural factors that push the majority of women away from hacking at a young age. I can&#x27;t point the finger of blame at anyone in particular, but I can report on what I have observed. Women are generally underrepresented in computer science departments, engineering programs, computer clubs and yes, startup incubators. It has nothing to do with Paul Graham or the YC partners. We&#x27;re all responsible as members of society at large.<p>I understand your reasons for not appliyng to YCombinator. TechStars is a great program, and I&#x27;m glad that you&#x27;ve thrived there. But there&#x27;s something to be said for seeing things with your own eyes. I would be very unhappy if someone dismissed me out of hand because of something that they&#x27;d heard.

I can see how your personal experience must be very frustrating, and I&#x27;m not attempting to belittle that.<p>However on the whole the Canadian system is better at delivering the health care that is needed.  Overall, it works better for more people, more of the time, and much more efficiently (i.e. cost effectively). The latter point means that sometimes people with non-critical issues have to wait -- usually not very long notwithstanding the stories people sometimes focus on (the dramatic failure modes of the US system are much, much worse).<p>That being said, if you a) have the right insurance, b) live in the right state, c) have money, and d) live in the right part (typically urban) of the state -- you can get very good care very quickly in the US.

A prime example of this is the North Hollywood shootout where the gunmen had several 75 and 100 round drum magazines.<p>No.  Drum magazines are prone to jamming, which is exactly what happened in your linked scenario (the gunman then decided to drop the rifle rather than clear the misfeed).  The same thing happened to the Aurora, Colorado shooter and his drum magazine.  An efficient killer would be better off with a MOLLE vest with the pouches filled with smaller-capacity magazines.<p>> Do hunters or those who enjoy shooting weapons legally NEED high-capacity magazines? The answer is no.  Under no circumstances does a civilian actually need or would even benefit from a high-capacity magazine unless they were killing people, cops, or zombies.<p>The 2nd amendment was not written for hunters or people who enjoy recreational shooting.  It is an emergency brake against tyranny and a prodding towards militia defense of the country rather than standing army (read what James Madison wrote about the subject), so yes it actually is about killing people.

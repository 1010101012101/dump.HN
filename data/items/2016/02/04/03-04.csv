This shift towards supporting research and long term capital intensive companies is very recent as far as I understand, at most a year, parts of it just in months.<p>There&#x27;s finding the companies/research projects, getting them staffed and sustainably funded, and then years if not decades of work before some of these real complex and hard problems are solved.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of it is going to work but we&#x27;re just looking at the first steps in this direction. It&#x27;ll be a few years before anyone is able to really judge whether it&#x27;s paying off or not. Unfortunately this is beyond most of our ( myself included ) attention spans, so we&#x27;ll probably feel like nothing is happening. Fortunately it seems like these folks are putting mechanisms in place that will outlast our collective attention and keep the engine running for the long time span these problems will need.<p>I&#x27;m pretty excited about it.",1454558298

But I think the fault is more so on them.</i><p>I completely agree, and AFAIK the Tufte essay does not even mention a critical point in this regard, which the Boisjoly paper does. The engineers had already tried to get all flights stopped until the O ring issue could be investigated and properly understood, in the August before the Challenger flight. NASA had refused. So the NASA managers were already aware that there was a critical flight risk, and they had already chosen to ignore it. That means it definitely wasn&#x27;t a case of bringing new information to management&#x27;s attention in order to drive a decision. It was a case of trying to get them to change, at least in part, a decision they had <i>already made</i>.<p>The argument about cold temperatures has to be viewed in that light--it was an attempt to find <i>something</i>, in the absence of good, hard data and a solid understanding of what was going on, that would at least get NASA to delay <i>some</i> flights, since they had already refused to delay <i>all</i> flights. In fact, considered solely on engineering grounds, the argument about cold temperatures was fairly weak (as Boisjoly points out in his essay). But it was weak not because cold temperature flights were almost as safe as warm temperature flights; it was weak because warm temperature flights were almost as <i>unsafe</i> as cold temperature flights! (A previous flight with significant blow-by had been made at a temperature of 75 F, and test stand data showed that the O-rings were not sealing completely at any temperature below 100 F.) But the engineers couldn&#x27;t say that the night before the Challenger flew, because they had already said it back in August and had been ignored.",1454557883

11031772,comment,10962784,10966958,0,0,elado,,,"TL;DR: It makes tons of sense.<p>In the beginning of JS+DOM, it was a common practice to write HTML with DOM events (in JS): (`<button onclick=&quot;doSomething()&quot;>`). Server rendered most things anyway so you could (`<button onclick=&quot;toggle(<%= someId %>)&quot;>...<div id=&quot;item-<%= someId %>&quot;>...`).\nProblem was tons of global functions all over the place, or many big objects and maintainability issues.<p>In the &quot;jQuery era&quot;, you&#x27;d write your <i>initial</i> HTML in .html files and jQuery all the events. It brought infinite amount of ways to write code, which often led to many styles and no conventions.<p><pre><code>    <button class=&quot;toggle&quot; data-target=&quot;item-<%= someId %>&quot;>\n    <div id=&quot;item-<%= someId %>&quot;>div</div>\n    $(&#x27;.toggle&#x27;).click(function () { $($(this).data(&#x27;target&#x27;)).toggle() })\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    <button class=&quot;toggle&quot;>+</button><div>div</div>\n    $(&#x27;.toggle&#x27;).click(function () { $(this).next().toggle() })\n</code></pre>\nor worse,<p><pre><code>    <button class=&quot;show&quot; data-text=&quot;hello&quot;>+</button>\n    $(&#x27;.show&#x27;).click(function () {\n       var $this = $(this)\n       var $div = $(&#x27;<div>&#x27;).text($this.data(&#x27;text&#x27;))\n       $this.after($div)\n    })\n</code></pre>\netc.<p>Many problems with this approach:<p>- You can&#x27;t tell which element has events bound to it just by looking at it. Any JS file can decide to do that\n- Usage of a CSS class to find elements is just a hack\n- Poorly named IDs/classes create collisions\n- After an action, the initial HTML no longer represents the current state\n- Server can render some HTML, then client changes it, and if things get out of sync, the only way to reset the state is to reload the entire page. Imagine a user signing in, and many parts of the page need to show things for a signed in user. Doing this manually would probably be error-prone, so it&#x27;s just easier to reload the page and let the server do that.<p>And then came the modern front end libraries/frameworks like React, Angular, Ember etc.<p>The main difference is that now the HTML representation is ALWAYS in sync with the data, AND the functional code that&#x27;s attached to each element is at the same place.<p>And the jQuery example becomes this:<p><pre><code>    // react\n\n    <button onClick={::this.toggle}>+</button>\n    {this.state.isVisible ? <div>div</div> : null}\n\n    toggle() { this.setState({ isVisible: !this.state.isVisible }) }\n\n\n    // angular 1.x\n\n    <button ng-click=&quot;toggle()&quot;>+</button>\n    <div ng-if=&quot;isVisible&quot;>div</div>\n\n    scope.toggle = () => scope.isVisible = !scope.isVisible\n\n</code></pre>\nWhen you look at this piece of code you immediately understand the ways it can be rendered and what affects it.

However, I had an infuriating experience with Vultr recently (not that I have reason to believe DO would have done any better). Vultr has poorly configured DDoS mitigation equipment. If that equipment believes your IP is under DDoS, it will automatically blackhole your IP from their upstreams.<p>With near-zero traffic on my interface - and for an internally facing VM, the IP address of which has never been published in any DNS, their DDoS &#x27;protection&#x27; system decided I was under DDoS attack and blackholed my IP with their upstreams. I investigated and my conclusion is that the most likely cause was that their system mis-idenfied the overlay networking software I was using (which communicates over UDP) as DDoS traffic.<p>I raised this issue with support, who did not manage to help. Amongst other things, they told me that they didn&#x27;t retain logs long enough to be helpful. I agreed that I would raise the issue with them again should it re-occur.<p>The <i>second</i> time they blackholed my IP, they didn&#x27;t even bother telling me. And when I filed a support ticket, they took somewhere around an hour to even respond - during the time they&#x27;ve taken my system offline, I expect them to make themselves available.<p>When I tried calling their parent company on the phone, they were downright rude with me. I understand they don&#x27;t usually do phone support, and that&#x27;s fine, but if you&#x27;ve told me that (A) you can only help me resolve a problem during an incident because you don&#x27;t keep logs, and (B) don&#x27;t make yourself available to me through your regular support channels, don&#x27;t get pissy with me for phoning you. And especially don&#x27;t completely refuse to do anything remotely helpful.<p>I ended up terminating the VM and moving that workload elsewhere. I don&#x27;t have time to be fixing other people&#x27;s networks, especially when they can&#x27;t be bothered to participate in the process.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because their BGP & AnyCast stuff looked really interesting, and I&#x27;d love to explore their offerings more.

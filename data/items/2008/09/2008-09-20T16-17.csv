309946,story,,,1,0,amichail,"Launching web sites early is a less confrontational way for managers to get their way.",,"One nice thing about releasing products early is that you don't need
to make correct decisions all the time.<p>Say employee X really wants to implement something in a way that the
project leader does not like.  Rather than forcing employee X to do it
his/her way, the project could be released to the public as ""beta"".
Employee X would then back down after negative feedback from the
public.<p>In this way, employee X feels more freedom, although it is eventually
taken away by the public.",1221927889

I am sick of everyone acting like Chrome is a coup d'etat of existing browser powerbrokers ... because it isn't, at all.<p>We already knew they would eventually support add-ons and we've seen extensions like the one you've proposed for a long time. I'm sorry if my annoyance is misdirected, but I don't understand why I'm the only one who sees this. Chrome is cool and browser development has gotten extremely interesting the last few months (especially now with SquirrelFish Extreme), but it is <i>not</i> the defeat of everyone else and I am tired of everyone acting like it is.<p>Apologies for venting.",1221927280

(Perhaps there was something major about penicillin's discovery I hadn't heard of.)<p>I was saying that ""gremlin"" seems like a good new term for people who do destructive mischief for fun (particularly of a cracking nature), but never actually related it to 4chan in any way; it just came out of that quote.

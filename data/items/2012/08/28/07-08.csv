People get confused with English having several definitions of discriminate some being bad socially (like discriminating against people because of their ethnicity).  If Google choses to discriminate based on neighborhood interest that is a sound economic decision.<p>The tricky political issue (in this particular instance) is if there is a correlation between the neighborhoods choosing to participate and ethnicity and  Google ends up running fiber to a bunch of white neighborhoods and not to a bunch of African American neighborhoods.<p>If the rich white neighborhoods all decided it wasn't worth it no one would care if Google didn't run fiber to them.  Most social scientists would say the issue of poor not having access is a concern that society should care about. But if there isn't an ethnicity component I doubt it has any political ""heat.""<p>If I was Google and the poor neighborhoods were too underrepresented I would likely create a some system to make it easier for at least some lower income areas to get fiber.  This is all a bigger game plan for Google - not really an attempt to get rich off KC.  I, and I believe Google, thinks fiber to everyone is good.  It might be Google can't afford to do that given the real economic conditions.  Even in that case hook some up, provided data for the government to decide if it is a social need worth funding (if it doesn't end up working without government help).<p>Google wants to find a solution that shows what they did in KC can be done across the country.  If it is just for the rich 15% that doesn't help Google much.  They want to find a solution that works to get fiber, at reasonable prices, with net neutrality to a huge portions of the USA (certainly above 70%).<p>If they need to tweak their starting plan I am pretty sure they will do so.  They are pretty smart most of the time though, they do behave idiotically at times.

4442607,comment,4441734,4442517,6,0,csense,,,"> The argument for abortion isn't that it's somehow OK to kill really young human<p>Not true!  At least, if you asked me to make an argument in favor of abortion, that's the argument that I would make.<p>No human within the first year or so after conception has any of the distinguishing features which give intelligent beings a higher moral status:  Tool use, language use, abstract thought, logical reasoning, permanent memory.<p>Therefore, the moral status of a human immediately after the time of conception t_0 is akin to that of an animal.  It's not okay to torture, abuse, or injure them for fun; it's not okay for people outside their family to interfere with them; it's morally and socially acceptable and even admirable for individuals to form very deep emotional attachments with them and spend enormous resources helping and protecting them; but it <i>is</i> okay to kill them humanely if there simply isn't a place for them.<p>The moral status of the very young human rises from that of a proto-human animal to that of a full human at time t_I, the time when they become intelligent.<p>The problem is that t_I is extremely difficult to measure.  It depends on your definition of intelligence and can be very different for different individuals.  (For severely brain-damaged individuals, it may even be the case that t_I = infinity.)<p>To deal with the difficulty of measuring t_I, our culture and laws have instead picked a deadline t_D, such that t_D is much smaller than t_I in all cases (regardless of differing definitions or individual cases).  We have declared that we should assume humans younger than t_D have proto-human legal status roughly equivalent to animal status, and humans older than t_D have full-human legal status.  Killing before the deadline is legal if done in a humane way with the consent of the mother; killing after the deadline is treated the same as killing an adult would be (only allowable in very limited circumstances such as self-defense).  Therefore our society can avoid some of the drains placed on it by humans who, it is known, will be born into far-from-ideal circumstances, while hopefully staying far away enough from t_I to avoid sanctioning the killing of anyone who has the moral status of a full human.  (Obviously, t_D is the time of birth plus delta, where delta is less than one day (I'm not sure exactly what delta is, but I'm pretty sure it's less than one day).  Delta is necessary to account for partial-birth abortions.)<p>The problem with many pro-abortion arguments is that they are of the form ""It is our belief that all humans have souls, and therefore full-human moral status, from the time of conception.""  It's not a problem that those are their religious beliefs; the problem is enshrining those beliefs into law in prohibitions on abortion.  Logic and facts, not religious beliefs, must be the basis of our laws; to do otherwise would open up the very can of worms that we try to avoid by separating church and state.  We can't observe souls, but we can observe intelligent behavior, and the latter seems not to preclude existing abortion laws in any way.  (Existing abortion laws also don't interfere with the religious beliefs of abortion opponents; if you believe abortion is morally wrong, <i>you</i> don't have to have one.  The law only steps in to the extent that anti-abortionists wish to impose their beliefs on others.)<p>Hypothetically, if the laws were expanded to legalize infanticide as ""extremely late abortion"" at any time up to, say, age three, then a moral argument would hold weight; many two-year-olds <i>do</i> use language and can exhibit surprisingly intelligent behaviors.  Likewise, if the laws were expanded to <i>require</i> abortions in certain circumstances (for example, to enforce a one-child-per-family policy like China has), that would also be wrong and almost surely unconstitutional; for it would interfere with the religious beliefs of most abortion opponents.  (I say ""most"" since I suppose it is possible there is some faction whose religious beliefs, if any, don't forbid abortion, but bases an opposition to abortion on non-religious grounds.  If they even exist, they're surely very small and not very vocal.)<p>Of course, everyone (myself included) regards such expansions as extremely morally repugnant; I know of no one who would even consider supporting them.  I'm just offering them against a hypothetical opponent who would say, ""If you would sanction the killing of innocent babies, you clearly have no moral compass!""  This worldview <i>does</i> have limitations on what is allowed; it just draws the line between ""unallowable atrocity under any circumstances"" and ""the lesser of two evils"" in a slightly different place than pro-lifers.<p>As much of a tendency as it is among liberals to put all conservatives in the same boat, both on HN and everywhere else the left gathers, abortion is possibly the best place to draw the line between libertarians and social conservatives:  The latter favor prohibitions, while the former should oppose them as unwanted government intrusion (although many do not, I suspect, due to simple realpolitik -- a sacrifice of a non-core position by a weaker leg of the stool to support a core position of a stronger leg to maintain the conservative coalition, presumably a compromise to be ""renegotiated"" -- possibly unilaterally -- when/if their relative strength ever changes.)",1346140422

The answer is that people may find themselves under peer pressure to (a) smoke pot, and (b) reject the value of scholarly activities. Someone might answer that IQ is predetermined, that it doesn't have any environmental component.

I mean that no matter with which notation you start with, you need to parse and evaluate it mentally to convert it into terms you actually think with.<p>I can see that for maths 'natives' it is helpful, because their mental models are very closely tied to the formal notation.

Generally, it's people who just don't know any better. Unfortunately, you see comments supporting the idea even on HN.<p>The important thing to understand about supersymmetry (SUSY) is that in the most general case, there are approximately 105 new parameters. That's far too many to probe in a meaningful way, so most models choose between 2 and 5 to vary, and fix the rest. Then a bunch of models are chosen that hopefully cover a wide spread of different behaviors.<p>The true part is that several models have been excluded, basically as well as the LHC is going to be able to exclude/discover anything in the current energy regime. However, some of these models were just not chosen very well to begin with (but have historical importance) and others were chosen to have maximal signal strength.<p>So as time goes on, the search for SUSY turns away from ""easy"" models and looks at more complicated ones.

4442521,comment,4441868,4441868,5,0,gioele,,,"My personal opinion on the causes of the inability to keep virtuous habits is that people lack external stimuli, review and pressure.<p>Talk to teenagers who train for swimming competitions. They <i>have</i> to be in the swimming pool by 6:30 or 7:00. This means that they, their instructors, their parents, even the swimming pool janitors will have to wake up at around 5:00 or 5:30, every day for years and years. Unsurprisingly most of the swimming athletes wake up at those ungodly hours and do that for years.<p>I suppose that the thing that helps swimmers wake up early is the social stigma that would arise from being late. Being late means disappointing your instructor and wasting the time of your parents and all the people that work at the swimming pool. This pressure, if well balanced, keeps you in check, even after the Hawthorn effect fades away.",1346138354

It actually reminds me of this collection of Isaac Asimov stories I've been reading called The Edge of Tomorrow, with each essay or story featuring a scientist. Asimov denies a deliberate connecting theme, but what I keep noticing is how scientists are just humans too; they aren't these ultra-intelligent, purely rational subspecies. Similarly, programmers may have an understanding of computers that others lack, but we are just as prone to imperfections, mistakes, and inefficiencies even though we work in our own domain of expertise. Acknowledging that seems more useful and honest (to me) than claiming that a certain methodology will make you capable of coding the perfect program the first time around or something.",1346138339

4442517,comment,4441734,4441734,13,0,mseebach,,,"This seems disingenuous to me. Already by calling what's essentially rhetoric ""arguments"", he's building a huge strawman.<p>Take abortion - according to opponents a fetus is a living human being, and actively and purposefully killing a living human being <i>is</i> murder in the Charles Manson style. The argument for abortion isn't that it's somehow OK to kill really young human, it's that fetuses aren't independent human beings, they're an extension of the mothers body. It's really not a relevant metric for wether murder is murder if there are grieving friends and family, or if people live in fear - it seems every other crime show deals with the murder of a miserable, lonely homeless guy or a prostitute. According to this argument, that's not murder at all.<p>The eugenics example is even worse. In the 1930s, people were absolutely certain eugenics was the best thing since sliced bread, then Hitler showed the world how bad that could go. To deny ""Those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it"" as a guiding principle seems rather hubristic to me.<p>""Evolutionary psychology is sexist!"" is a different beast: some people have decided, not through science, but though politics, that material differences between men and women (or the races for that matter) doesn't exist. Thus science finding otherwise is unacceptable. Of course it's a bad argument to reject science because it doesn't fit your political agenda.",1346138331
4442516,comment,4441422,4442153,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I realize that epidemiology can be sloppy science, but it's the only way we can even hope to tackle immensely important questions like this.<p>First, that's false -- straight-up false. We can violate ethical guidelines and get terrific, reliable science. All we have to do is abandon our principles, and victimize innocent subjects. Example the Alabama Syphilis study:<p><a href=""http://www.dartmouth.edu/~thabif/newfiles/tuskee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~thabif/newfiles/tuskee.html</a><p>The above is a despicable example of subject treatment, but it falsifies your claim.<p>Meanwhile, without abandoning our principles, we can use animal models, as is done with many kinds of study -- heart disease, cancer and many others.<p>> This study is one of possibly many future studies that will attempt to etch away at the null hypothesis ""there is no relationship between intelligence and smoking marijuana before adulthood"".<p>The study under discussion is a sham masquerading as science, it has no scientific value, the design is so poor that no reliable conclusion can be drawn from it. The level of control for confounding factors is nonexistent. Apart from that central design flaw, both the subjects and the experimenters know who the pot smokers were. It's a joke pretending to be science, and abandons every recognized experimental discipline.<p>The study certainly doesn't ""etch away"" at the null hypothesis, because there are too many pedestrian explanations for the outcome that aren't even in the thinking of the experimenters.<p>> One day ten other studies like it may provide a more convincing story, or may disprove the idea altogether.<p>Disproof is also impossible with such a sloppy study design. I can't believe what you're saying.<p>> Until then, this is probably the best research on the question yet.<p>Or the worst, and both claims can be true at once. Your remark reminds me of a Woody Allen joke. His girlfriend says, ""But sex without love is an empty experience!"" Allen replies, ""Yes, but as empty experiences go, it's one of the best!"" As meaningless science goes, this study is one of the best.<p>As I said earlier, I've been reading such studies for about 35 years, and (a) they all suffer from fatal design flaws, and (b) they always support the prejudices of the granting agencies and/or those of the experimenters. Also, important, studies that come to the opposite conclusion, or that don't come to a clear conclusion, tend not to be published.<p>> It is what will help get scientists further funding on the topic. And that's why it's important.<p>More bad science is important? I ask you to think about what you're saying. This study is trash masquerading as science. Anyone can design and carry out an equally sloppy study (and psychologists do this all the time) that comes to the opposite conclusion, through the simple expedient of ignoring the many confounding factors inherent in retrospective studies that don't have a control group or  the kind of experimental discipline that can lead to reliable scientific conclusions.<p>This is not science, it is psychological science.",1346138298

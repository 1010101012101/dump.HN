If I am looking to test an idea with little downsize risk, I probably choose something else over DotCloud simply because of the price.  Later, when I want the supposed scalability, then DotCloud is the choice.  Is the free ""trial"" account a time-limited account (as with Squarespace), or something more similar to Heroku?<p>See, Heroku is the elephant in the room.  Initially, I saw DotCloud as the Heroku for Django (and other platforms), but the pricing, and how you describe it, says otherwise.  There unfortunately appears to be some market confusion, as they seem to be targeting a different market segment than many people thought.  The challenge is for DotCloud to educate the market that they aren't necessarily a Heroku-type service, but something else that justifies a $99/month price.",1308765362

You think these multiple event-based ecosystems were all staffed by drooling idiots who didn't realize that? This isn't some sort of subtle point that can be used as a base of a secret sauce, it's a blindingly-obvious core requirement. They <i>all</i> have drivers for all that sort of thing. Some more than others, but they all have the basics. Many were better stocked with more and higher-quality libraries four years ago than Node.js has now.<p>This is why I say I hate the Node hype, even as I'm only really ambivalent about Node itself. It's <i>bullshit</i>. It's like Ryan Dahl went into hibernation in 1995, only to pop out again a couple of years ago. It's full of lies about the state of the programming world. Node looks <i>fucking awesome</i> if you uncritically swallow the propaganda packet. Well, gosh, no wonder, it's like a magical 2010-ish library magically showed up in 1995!

2684232,comment,2682415,2683831,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"No, you're missing the point.  Mt. Gox is not publishing the transactions that occur inside their exchange to the blockchain; they are tracking them themselves.  All the bitcoins deposited at Mt. Gox are in one big wallet.  Only when a user deposits or withdraws coins does a transaction get posted to the blockchain.  (I'm not 100% sure of this, admittedly, but I've seen no evidence to the contrary and lots of indirect evidence that supports it.)<p>So what could happen, as the result of bugs in their code, or of an attack, or (hypothetically) of deliberate fraud on their part, is that the total BTC balance of all account holders could become greater than the total BTC they have in their wallet.  As the above posters noted, this would have the effect of creating BTC; no one outside the exchange would be able to tell that it had occurred until someone tried to withdraw their BTC and found it wasn't there.<p>Now what they <i>could</i> do is make a separate wallet for each user and post all trades to the blockchain.  This would perhaps be more in the spirit of Bitcoin as it would prevent the totals from getting out of whack.  But as I say, I'm pretty sure they're not doing that -- for one thing, if they were, rolling back trades, as they have recently done, would be impossible.  (And although I was not involved in this 500k selloff, on either side, I think they have to roll it back to preserve any hope of Bitcoin being taken seriously.)",1308764907

I know js pretty well (and most of the syntax hacks), so this is pretty straight forward. \nIf I try and do the same thing with django or rails, then I find myself investing serious amounts of time just understanding the syntax (the splat operator is a good example). \nUsing the same language (not necessarily the same environment) that you already know on the server does have genuine benefits, even if you do have to treat it differently.",1308764814

Tags and stashes, as well, do not seem to be supported in github for mac. Perhaps I have simply not found them in the interface yet.<p>In terms of workflow, performing tasks in github for mac is more cumbersome. The gui, while nice, does not fit all that well to a fast git workflow. You must wait for panes to load separately from one another, so one code review and commit may involve loading several panes. This is much different from Tower, which tends to keep most tasks present in the main window. In a dual-monitor setup, Tower works well when occupying a screen, while github for mac would be wasting space if used in that format.<p>The history browser, too, is quite simplistic. Tower can render commit history in the way that github for mac has chosen to do it, but I prefer the way that gity and others have allowed a history list and commit tree. One thing I like about Tower is the ability to scroll down a commit history and instantly see the diffs of that commit. With github for mac, you must click on a commit and bring up the diff in the whole window -- which seems a symptom of its non-multitasking workflow.<p>At this point, I could not see myself using this over Tower in any project scope, though this is of course tinged by my experience with working with Tower. It is very nice that github for mac is free, and having more offerings in the space is going to be great for innovation, but I do wish they had taken a different approach with their interface.

And at that moment, by implication from my previous point, they might just also beat us at everything else :-) Remember that, on an absolute scale, humans are about as bad at math as you can be and still build a civilization (otherwise civilization would've happened at a lower level of development) and also that we probably suck at math because math is a conscious task (see Moravec's paradox).<p>Related link that should make you scared if you buy my reasoning: <a href=""http://www.vetta.org/2009/09/monte-carlo-aixi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vetta.org/2009/09/monte-carlo-aixi/</a> .",1308763065

If you're using a plenoptic camera purely for producing 2d images, you can reduce pixel size further than you would normally. This is because each pixel in the output image is the average of many primary pixels in the sensor. The primary pixels can be smaller and noisier while still getting a smooth output image. In rough terms the resolution loss is a cosine term over the pixel areas involved, so it's modest.<p>The technology also allows a tradeoff between resolution and sharpness that is novel, including the possibility of realizing resolutions beyond the diffraction limit.<p>The cameras used in research projects suffered reduced resolution because they were a frankenstein modification of an off the shelf DSLR. A camera designed to be plenoptic from the beginning has different constraints.<p><i>""color aberration and aliasing""</i><p>I believe these can be addressed in the processing stage. I don't see anything about either of these issues that's insurmountable.<p><i>""Low FPS. Each image requires lots of processing""</i><p>The processing can be done at any time after the fact. The primary image capture is just that, a raw image, same as any other camera.<p>The processing is also relatively simple convolution which can be done via FFT. Overall it's comparable to common video and image compression algorithms, not something new that requires a supercomputer in your camera.<p><i>""Proprietary toolchain""</i><p>There's no reason we can't standardize raw plenoptic images. Also, once the plenoptic raw has been processed it can be saved as any available 2d or 3d format, from png to psd to jpeg. These files will be fine in Photoshop or on the web.<p><i>""You can just produce a composite image that's sharp all over, but why not use a conventional camera with stopped-down[2] lens, then""</i><p>This allows depth of field independent of aperture size, which is a new capability. This will greatly aid low light photography, particularly dim landscapes.<p>But secondly, the images contain depth information, with all that implies. This is a very different tool from a stopped down lens. It's capable of realizing images that are physically imposible with a traditional lens and sensor.<p><i>""thrillingly expensive""</i><p>Citation needed.

2684070,comment,2682799,2683783,5,0,lucasjung,,,"I agree that it's a huge IF, but the repercussions are much worse than ""inconvenience."" You have to follow the scenario a few steps further to figure out the full magnitude of things. ""Civilization"" is, in a sense, a massive and highly complex life-support system. You don't really need it to live in a small town, but the populace of a city or even a large town can't survive without it. There's a saying, ""Any city is only three days away from a riot."" Without a massive and sophisticated logistical system constantly bringing new supplies in and waste out, food and other critical supplies will run out very quickly, and then things get ugly fast.<p>After the financial system is zeroized, how do you get paid? The company you work for has no money with which to pay you. They have no way to make money, because none of their customers have money to pay them with. If you're not getting paid, what's your incentive to show up to work? <i>Everybody</i> would be in that conundrum, so commerce would grind to a halt and cities would start to starve. The government would order law enforcement and the military to keep working even without pay, and they could probably force workers in key industries like power companies to keep going to work, but they couldn't do that for everyone. Even if you had cash to buy groceries with, the grocery store probably wouldn't have groceries to sell to you because they would have no money with which to buy them.<p>The government could magically set account balances, putting money into everyone's pocket based on some sort of guesstimate, but that wouldn't really work, either. Fiat money is based on trust: the assumption that if you accept a dollar in exchange for goods, you will be able to turn around and exchange that dollar for a comparable quantity of other goods. If the financial system is zeroized, that trust is broken. People would rather have tangible assets instead of money of dubious origin that has demonstrated the capacity to literally vanish overnight. Hoarding and hyper-inflation would ensue.<p>The punchline of all of this is that millions of people would starve to death in the cities within a matter of weeks. Millions more would pour out into the countryside, looting and pillaging. Law and order would break down completely in all but the most remote places.  Remote places would probably degrade much more gracefully to lower levels of technology, and bounce back quickly as well after the dust settled, but the cities and suburbs would literally be wiped out. An event like this would probably result in a death toll comparable to a widespread nuclear strike, and would equally destroy the nation as a functioning political and social entity.",1308762766

If the handler is CPU-intensive, the design of the server (threaded vs. AIO) is irrelevant.  Both will perform equally, the only difference being that on an SMP system, the OS could schedule the thread on a different processor.  This is why the typical deployment model for AIO servers is to start one server per processor and route incoming requests to a proxy to balance the requests among the available servers.<p>On the other hand, if the handler is dependent on slow network services (e.g. database or downstream API service), the AIO-based server will easily be able to handle additional incoming requests while waiting for the other tasks to complete, subject to memory.

2684004,comment,2683372,2683573,1,0,markkanof,,,"I've started using Backbone.js in a very limited way for some of our existing apps.<p>What I'm doing is just using views as a way to provide some structure to what is currently a mess of jQuery event bindings and DOM manipulation. So instead of have a Backbone view that gets configured with a template and passed a model to render, I just do some setup code in the initialize function and then use Backbone's event function to setup all my event bindings for different DOM events that will occur within the element that is the root of that particular view.<p>This is working really well so far.  It doesn't require completely rewriting the app to be a single-page client side heavy application, but does provide a significant amount of structure to the code making it much more manageable.  It also lets me reuse some views (sort of like widgets) that were previously tied directly to specific elements in the DOM.",1308762010

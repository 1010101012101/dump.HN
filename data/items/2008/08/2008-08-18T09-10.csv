279118,comment,278927,279094,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Yeah, this is certainly an interesting topic in UI design. When Microsoft had the problem of people not knowing what to do when their computer started up, they relabeled ""system"" to ""start"" counterintuitively rather than building a progressive disclosure system into Windows. It may have been better to put a little hovering popup bubble that pointed towards the system icon and said ""Click here to start"" the first few times you started up (or until user testing showed people had learned what to do).<p>In later versions of windows, they had a whole window with tons of options pop up at <i>every single startup</i>. In Vista, the window has useless computer information, like how much RAM you have. They not only confuse beginners, but they punish intermediate and advanced users until they find the little checkbox that says not to start it every time.",1219052982

If it sounds like the tone is compatible, then rewrite what you said until it is polite.<p>Anyway, with respect to the topic: you're suggesting that there is the possibility of a higher level of knowledge beyond what we can observe with our physical eyeballs. This is a fallacy that goes against everything science stands for. Science is the platform upon which you build models that describe the physical world.<p>For example, if we witness the effects of gravity occurring over and over in many experiments, then we can create a model of what we saw: the Law of Gravity. Then we can make the assumption that whenever there is mass, there is gravity. So far, it works. If something can be physically shown to break/violate the law, then it will be reexamined and the model will be changed to satisfy the new information.<p>There is no evidence of anything above or beyond the physical/theoretical models of science. To suggest there is implies faith.<p>Are you religious, maxklein?",1219052226

CouchDB speaks JSON natively, for example.<p>On 2, there are solutions to this problem based on closures, and basic politeness (YUI uses the YAHOO. prefix, while ExtJS uses Ext., and they can co-exist in one browser).  It's not perfect.  I'd like to see Perl-style package name spaces, or similar--nothing obtuse like the new PHP namespace support--just very concise and simple but powerful.  I, personally, don't think Java style encapsulation and object border defense is all that important...but maybe enterprise users will (though Perl does OK in the stodgy banking and finance world, so it shouldn't be too scary for them).",1219051837

279102,comment,278704,278996,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>JS has been around for a while. Web developers's have known it for a while.</i><p>Have they?  What was the biggest JavaScript application you deployed five years ago?  For me, it was maybe 5k, and did nothing more than some basic form validation and content hiding effects.  And now? Well, our biggest will be including almost all of ExtJS which is I think about 400k, compressed.  jQuery is ~60k, compressed.  Our use of JavaScript is definitely not declining.  Is yours?<p>I think it's only in the past two years that the work of the JS library developers have proven that large JavaScript apps are plausible.  They've also smoothed over most of the browser compatibility issues--which are no small part of the historic tendency to avoid doing any heavy lifting in JavaScript.  Browsers are also getting better about those issues.  That standardization plus quality libraries has made it more reasonable to ""write once, run anywhere"" with heavy JavaScript usage.  Despite the cynicism with which the phrase is usually uttered, it is still a very valuable trait in a language.<p>I don't think AppJet has played any role in JavaScript history to date...but they might, as they're very smart fellows.  Far more important players include Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Adobe, and the Open Source library developers.  And, of course, a few other YC alumni have been major contributors to the JavaScript juggernaut: John Resig of jQuery fame had a YC-backed startup before joining Mozilla Foundation, and Blake Ross and Joe Hewitt started YC-backed Parakey.<p>Anyway, it's not that I think JavaScript is perfectly suited for all tasks--or better suited for any particular task than X language.  I just think it is well enough suited for most tasks (including a few for which Ruby, Python, Perl, Haskell, Lisp, etc. never will likely be at all suitable for...like the client-side of rich web apps), and the friction of switching between multiple languages, and the interoperation cost and complexity, is high enough, that JavaScript could pretty easily become the de facto standard language for web apps.  And, since most of us can agree that nearly all end user apps will eventually be web apps, that means most apps.<p>Again, I really wouldn't want to bet against it.  I'm glad I happen to find JavaScript to be a very pretty language.  It has some rough spots, but overall, I don't mind working with it.  It's biggest problems, I find, are caused by the DOM and its not quite comfortable connection to JavaScript.",1219050984

The first step is to remove Robert Mugabe from power and, probably with international help, instill some sort of civility and credibility in the government there by appointing a just governor. But there are no protections against what happened to Mugabe happening to the new president/ruler. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, as Orwell said.<p>In the short term, Zimbabwe is kind of screwed. They have a hyperintelligent criminal dictator, a mass exodus of their most intelligent and rich people, and inflation so high that conducting business is impossible. And the government there doesn't seem to be doing anything drastic to fix these problems.<p>It's sad. More than ten million people live there in extreme poverty.

The bulk of your users are intermediates and power users. A user interface should cater to those people and gently nudge beginners in the same direction.<p>The old word interface (not the ribbon) actually did a pretty good job in this. Beginners used the menubar to do things. The options where accompanied by icons (""ooh, that's the same as the one on the iconbar."") and keyboard shortcuts (""What happens if I press Ctrl - S?""). The user interface doesn't get in the way of power users and teaches beginners and intermediate users.",1219050087

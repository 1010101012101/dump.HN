2577263,comment,2576833,2576833,26,0,stiff,,,"The term ""axiomatic system"" is consequently misused in the article. Probably the author had a ""formal system"" in mind, an axiomatic system is one in which one can deduce theorems from axioms and I don't think lambda calculus is such a system. A lot of the statements in the article are so vague and imprecise, it is hard to assign any meaning to them. Just look at the fragment of the article:<p>""Common Lisp is one answer to this question. Its core is an axiomatic system, the lambda calculus, which John McCarthy extended just enough to write an interpreter for the resulting calculus in itself.""<p>Lambda calculus is not at the core of Common Lisp or even Lisp, it was just an inspiration for Lisps model of computation.<p>""Common Lisp augments the interpreter with other automata on the same substrate which make construction straightforwards. Though the choice of automata may vary, the essential idea of reifying the act of construction is universal.""<p>Can someone explain what is he trying to say here? You can build languages with extremely different semantics while still keeping the ideas of S-expressions, centering the language around function application and closures, for example you can choose lazy evaluation over eager evaluation and end up with a very different language. In no way is lambda calculus some immutable core of Lisp, its model of computation is much more complex and arbitrary.<p>""Common Lisp and Haskell are built around variants of the lambda calculus. Each substrate makes certain approaches to problems natural, though neither is a natural vehicle for human thought. The brains adaptation to the lambda calculus is usually experienced as an epiphany.""<p>Seldom if ever has programming in Lisp or Haskell anything to do with lambda calculus, unless of course you mean in a way so vague the term loses its meaning... He then goes one to essentially describe how Haskell is referentially transparent and Common Lisp is not, but he makes it sound like it is some philosophical difference deeply rooted in the ideas behind Lisp or Haskell, while it's just a design decision where each option has specific tradeoffs. To me all this is just some ""metaphysical"" mumbo-jambo, the metaphor comparing programming language to an artists medium from which he starts doesn't bring any practical insight into anything - I think some people like it only because the greatest painters are widely admired by the general public, while this is rarely so even with the greatest programmers, so someone might feel his job is a little bit cooler when reading this. I do not see what real insight someone could gain from this article.",1306179704

We also realised that it was when we were working out together that we had the most fun, got the best results and actually looked forward to the workout. What we wanted was a quick and easy way to find a great workout somewhere nearby and go out and do it, but nothing seemed to exist that did this for us.<p>We figured it was a problem that a lot of people were likely also having, so we built a business and a community around this idea to scratch our own itch and hopefully solve the same problem for a lot of other people.

I was the Director of Systems at FreeGate (an internet Appliance company) and we decided to do our 'UI' in Java, in the browser. (feeling it would give us wide reach) but at that time in particular (1996 - 2000) there was a lot of churn in the browser market and point releases of the browser could change significant behaviors.<p>Today that is less of an issue as pretty much everyone has punted on supplying their own version of Java for the browser and instead relying on the Snoracle version. However the UI compatibility is tied up inside the support for CSS and/or HTMLx where x is 4, 4.1, or 5 even.<p>Mobile apps for say Android which use their toolkit, and written in Java of course, are reasonably compatible across Android devices. However challenges with Honeycomb seem to have highlighted what happens when you change around some base assumptions. Even the migration from Android 1.6 and 2.0 was fraught with issues around new capabilities (and diverse capabilities) between handsets.<p>Configuration Management is a Hard Problem (tm) on any system and people see the Windows eco-system or the MacOS eco-system and feel like they should be able to do that cross-platform. I agree that if that problem gets solved in a meaningful way it will forever change the way we interact with our machines, but I don't think browsers are the great hope for cross platform compatibility.",1306179425

Things that look good and things that don't.  Things that feel good and things that don't.  Things that communicate themselves well and things that don't.  UX is supposedly looking for the intersection of all of those axes but they're all very subjective.<p>If you want to be good at UX, never ever ever go to sites like useit, you won't learn anything helpful, and you'll probably learn something harmful.  You just need to get out there and experience what's available and think very hard about what's right and wrong with it.  There are no rules, no laws, and the lessons you learn are difficult to translate to anything universal.  The moment you start thinking about ""85% of ipad users like blue buttons"" or ""People can only remember 7 things"" you lose.  Tomorrow's successful UI is going to break today's rules.<p>EDIT: I should clarify, I don't mean to say that I don't peruse portfolio sites and have a number of blog subscriptions, but none of them I'd feel confident recommending.

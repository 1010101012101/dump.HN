In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential ― as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth. You'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you'll hear about them.<p>To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.</i>",1238977035

Most bands only make around $2 an album. Digital downloads earn an artist even less. And usually major labels are in charge of an album's production, but take the cost out of the artist's gross. Basically artists can sometimes pay more of the costs of cd production than the label does. So I doubt Radiohead would have made more money from downloads if they had used a label.<p>And as you mentioned, there are the benefits from the press and popularity. Also, Radiohead has a database of their fans who were willing to download the album. That has to be valuable to them to.<p>Artists Royalties: <a href=""http://www.ascap.com/jam/read_about/mm_artist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ascap.com/jam/read_about/mm_artist.html</a><p>The problem with recording contracts (info is somewhat dated):<a href=""http://www.negativland.com/albini.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.negativland.com/albini.html</a>",1238976342

I was speaking with the assumption that specialization implies greater difficulty, greater practice, greater determination, and in effect, demands greater smarts.<p>""Generalist"" is being thrown around loosely here. A really good generalist is probably a specialist in being general. In other words, a good specialist goes really, really deep, but a good generalist goes really, really broad. Both are very difficult, and after this discussion, I think a majority of programmers won't fall into either, even if they think they do.",1238976182

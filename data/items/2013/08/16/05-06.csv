The article isn&#x27;t really about C++ in any general sense.<p>b. The author fails to learn the solutions that are commonly used in C++ to solve his problems so auhtor fails to teach the reader anything<p>The article is about a couple specific design pitfalls that occur when using C++ exceptions and how the author never solved them. The only conclusion is avoid the design anti-patterns the author used.<p>So what anti-patterns did he use? The author used exceptions (an optional language feature best used for abort handling of RAII operations) to handle return codes from paths inside a function (which is usually handled with error codes, not exceptions). Not a real problem except that the author failed to carry sufficient context through to the catch location and therefore couldn&#x27;t clean up (although clean up should have been handled by RAII destructors, catch should only ever need to clean up &quot;this&quot;, which should know its own state). Author also failed to catch with sufficient locality and hence made his code confusing.<p>Instead of realising that exceptions weren&#x27;t well suited to error code handling and he wasn&#x27;t throwing enough context information and he should have been using RAII anyway, the author wrote off exceptions for all tasks  including constructors (which is a poor choice since it eliminates all possibility of RAII from the program). This can still work but then the author couldn&#x27;t work out how to write a factory method that potentially returns an error code instead of an object and instead juggled the ugly state problem of extant but invalid objects. Author could simply have returned a boost::optional<my_class_which_can_fail_construction> from a factory method instead of requiring all that nasty state stuff inside his class.<p>Instead of learning from many mistakes, author blames entire language.",1376632677

6222396,comment,6221602,6222126,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"The only thing that&#x27;s going to matter in effectively reforming medical cost structures in the U.S. is getting a critical mass of people who are shut out from medicine due to the insurance scam. While there are presently <i>some</i> people who are in a bad position, it&#x27;s not enough people to really mount a meaningful united front. Sure, people are upset, but not enough people are upset in the right way to really make policymakers fear for their careers and/or lives.<p>Huge swaths of &quot;money&quot; in the medical industry are the result of paper pushing, pure and simple. No one is spending their own money, or even really &quot;real&quot; money: the doctor&#x27;s bill will say something outrageous for the cash price, because they know the insurers will demand a large reduction, and even though they write &quot;$40,000&quot; for something, they don&#x27;t actually expect anyone to pay that directly. They expect you to either call and get a &quot;cash payment discount&quot;, i.e., something close to what they charge insurance companies (which is still really high, because insurance companies aren&#x27;t spending &quot;real&quot; money either), or to use your insurer to &quot;pay&quot; the bill.<p>Remove the lecherous middle-men who do nothing but shuffle numbers around and we can start making progress on medical pricing. This is not the ONLY cause of high costs, but it is easily the largest and most perverse problem point, because this type of billing completely destroys all conventional rules of supply and demand.<p>Interestingly, the Affordable Care Act does the opposite of this, and strengthens the lecherous middle-men to the point that it will be illegal not to give them money (the government will forcibly take the money from you in the form of a &quot;tax penalty&quot; if you do not voluntary sign up for &quot;medical insurance&quot;).",1376632550

6222371,comment,6220740,6220740,5,0,ramanujan,,,"Very interesting and highly creative. A few thoughts.<p>1) If a graphical plot turns data into something visual, an audio &quot;plot&quot; turns data into something audible. Your output is an audio file rather than an image or video file. The typical applications of this are to turn a boolean flag into a chime (e.g. text message received). Your important insight is that this can be extended to longer-form audio outputs.<p>2) When is audio more advantageous than image or video?<p><pre><code>  - When you cannot look at a screen (driving, working out)\n  - When there are too many screens (control room)\n  - In a very dark environment where visibility is impeded\n  - If you are blind or vision-impaired\n</code></pre>\nThis could find real application in cockpits/control rooms, to ensure that a pilot is perceiving data even if they aren&#x27;t looking at a particular dial. It could also be useful for various fitness and health apps that don&#x27;t need you to look at the screen all the time.<p>Perhaps the most interesting application would be in a car, which is where people spend a great deal of time and have their ears and brains (but not their eyes) free. Some ideas:<p>a) Could you generate different sounds based on the importance of a text message (doing something like Gmail&#x27;s importance filtering) signaling that you don&#x27;t really need to respond to this particular message right now while driving?<p>b) Could you have audio feedback for important things along the road? For example, the problem with the Trapster app (trapster.com) is that I need to look at the phone to see where the speedtraps are. You can imagine an integrated audio feed that could give information like this and also tell you your constantly updated ETA (via Google Maps API call). Or you could listen to the pulse of your company on the road to do something semi-useful, and drill down into notable events via voice.<p>c) The really interesting thing is if you could pair this with a set of defined voice control commands. As motivation: an audible plot can&#x27;t be backtracked like a visual plot. With a visual plot your eyes can just scan back to the left. To scan back and re-heard the sound you just heard requires rewinding and replaying. But it could be interesting to set up a small set of voice commands that allow not just rewinding, but rewinding and zooming. So you hear an important &quot;BEEP&quot; and you want to say something like &quot;STOP. ZOOM&quot; and set up the heuristics such that this identifies the right BEEP and then gives an audio drill-down of exactly what that BEEP represented.<p>d) Done right, you might be able to turn a subset of webservices into a sort of voice-controlled data radio for the road. People spend thousands of hours in their cars so it&#x27;s a real opportunity.",1376631954

It caused me to go back through my university books and study a lot of the core concepts that I enjoyed learning and have gotten away from by doing more menial programming tasks (not to say that I won&#x27;t be don&#x27;t those sorts of things at the job).<p>Also, if they said that they wanted to try me out for a couple weeks I would have refused the offer.

Literally runs VirtualBox on the client side.<p>Right, sorry I meant the situation that Arc was intended to remedy (from the site):<p>>  I want to build apps in Python and C and ship them in the browser. I can&#x27;t.<p>> I ran full steam into this problem when I built Dirpy, a web app that records MP3s from YouTube. I could have built a native app in Python and C, but to test, distribute, and maintain builds for every OS is a total nightmare. So I built Dirpy as a web app, did all the work on servers, and paid $25,000 every month in hosting costs.<p>>> Browsers can&#x27;t run Linux software like ffmpeg, can&#x27;t run Python, can&#x27;t reach native performance, and can&#x27;t make cross-domain requests.<p>>> ffmpeg definitely can be run in browsers, as can python. How close to native performance needs to be measured in each case, of course. I&#x27;m curious if they compared the performance and found it lacking, or just didn&#x27;t try the browser options at all.<p>Totally agreed (I was quoting the site there, to be clear) - I am a huge fan of emscripten&#x27;s approach, and I think it would work really well for this use case. VirtualBox is overkill here, and getting people to install something like this is a huge barrier.<p>However I still think that it would not be legal to distribute the codecs one would need to do this, and it&#x27;d also be against YouTube&#x27;s terms of service.",1376631676

6222290,comment,6220820,6221764,12,0,ufo,,,"I kinda have to disagree with you here. The problem of callback hell has nothing to do with the funcions being anonymous. In fact, you kinda want to have anonymous functions if you want to keep things as similar as possible to traditional code.<p>For example, when you have code like<p><pre><code>    var x = f();\n    print(x);\n</code></pre>\nonly a hardcore extremist like Uncle Bob would write it as<p><pre><code>    var x;\n\n    function start(){\n       x = f();\n       onAfterF();\n    }\n\n    function onAfterF(){\n       print(x);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nbecause now your code logic is split among a bunch of functions, the variables had to be hoisted to where everyone can see them and the extra functions obscure control flow. In the first case its obvious that its a linear sequence of statements but in the second you cant be sure a-priori how many times onAfterF gets called, when it gets called and who calls it.<p>Coming back on topic, callback hell is not just about nesting and your current code still suffesr a bit from it. The real problem is that you cant use traditional structured control flow (for, while, try-catch, break, return, etc) and must instead use lots of explicit callbacks. Additionally, for this same reason, callback code looks very different from how you would normally write synchronous code and its a PITA if you ever have to convert a piece of code from one style to the other.",1376630165

The slave has nowhere to go.<p>Wage slavery, the term, was coined when industrial jobs were coming on to the scene in the north and there was still slavery in the south. Groups of laborers in these new factories soon went on protest. They self-described their situation as being similar to slave work/living standards but with a wage. Basically what we today would call inhumane.<p>This sentiment never diminished but instead was overwhelmed by the dominance of industrialized work in this format. Their protest fell on deaf ears because now all the jobs offered were like that and unions decided to fight for better working conditions instead of the system at large. Which leads us to today.<p>It&#x27;s hypocritical when employees lambaste labor movements but will gladly partake the fruits of better wages and working standards.<p>It seem human nature will put up with a lot of things. An anthropological account i read: The anthropologist visited some area around Tibet. The system in place there required newly married women upon marriage to leave their husbands and work for the lord of the area, often as a concubine. After a year or so she would leave but not to return to her husband but instead go to a work camp where she would serve as a comfort girl. After that she returned.<p>The obviously shocked anthropologist asked why did people put up with this arrangement?

6222276,comment,6211250,6213628,2,0,bad_user,,,"This is the first time I ever heard anybody complain about UTF-16, citing it as the reason for why the JVM consumes more memory, which is of course bullshit.<p>One reason for why JVM apps appear to consume so much memory is because the JVM allocates more memory than it needs. It does so because the garbage collectors are generational and compacting (well, CMS is non-compacting, but when the memory gets too fragmented, the VM does fallback to a stop-the-world compaction of memory). In a server context the JVM also does not release the free memory it has to the operating system, because allocating that memory in the first place is expensive and so it keeps it for later usage ... the result is that memory allocation on top of the JVM is as efficient as stack allocation, since all the JVM does is to increment a pointer, and deallocation of short-lived objects is nearly as innexpensive as stack unwinding, since the GC is generational and deallocates stuff in bulk. These capabilities come at a cost, as the GC also needs memory to move things around, but it&#x27;s also memory well spent (e.g. Firefox has been plagued by memory fragmentation for years).<p>Speaking of Golang, it has some of the shittiest GCs in existence ... non-generational, non-compacting, non-concurrent and &quot;mostly precise&quot;. Of course, it used to be fully conservative, which meant you could easily end up with really nasty memory leaks on 32bits systems, because the GC wasn&#x27;t able to make a difference between Ints and pointers.<p>The only thing saving Go is the ability to work in many cases with the stack, alleviating the stress that the GC faces, but this low-level capability will also prevent it from having a good GC anytime soon, like the JVM has had for years.<p>And really, in terms of memory usage, you should see how the JVM&#x27;s CMS or G1 behaves in production, as it makes all the difference. Our web-service (written in Scala) that&#x27;s being hit by more than 30,000 requests per second that must be served in under 100ms per request, was at some point hosted on Heroku, using only 8 instances, instances which have less than 400 MB of usable RAM. It was absolutely superb seeing it in action, as the processes themselves were not exceeding 200 MB of real usage - Heroku even told us that we are costing them more than we are paying them.<p>So yeah, you can talk bullshit about strings being UTF-16, but the real wold disagrees.",1376629850

It&#x27;s an awful question because the kernel may not be involved at all on a user-level call to malloc() (e.g., a caching allocator like libumem or a traditional allocator that needn&#x27;t extend the break for a given allocation), may be involved in a minor capacity if the break must be extended (on most systems, a system call and some VM interaction), or could be involved substantially if the allocator is a mapping allocator and page faults are induced (text and data) or scheduling events or anything else that necessitates kernel involvement.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, when I have historically interviewed university hires for kernel positions, the question I ask is much simpler; namely, what does &quot;* ((int *)NULL)&quot; do?  Sadly, most university students -- even ones who have done very well in their university computer science courses -- don&#x27;t get this right.  And it&#x27;s sad because it&#x27;s not really the question, but rather just the segue to the actual question: when a candidate correctly answers that NULL is dereferenced and the program crashes[1], I ask them to write the program (statement, really) in an assembly of their choosing (most graduates have MIPS or SPARC on the resume) and I then ask for everything that happens between the execution of that instruction and the resulting core dump and return of control to the shell.  With a qualified candidate, this could easily be a multi-hour jaunt through microprocessor architecture and operating systems implementation.<p>All of that said:  I don&#x27;t really do that anymore, but rather look to a candidate&#x27;s open source works.  The last kernel engineer I hired had done open source work that was so impressive that my interview consisted only of me determining that he had done the work himself -- which took all of 30 seconds or so.

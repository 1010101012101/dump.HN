7720345,comment,7715901,7716555,1,0,pron,,,"1. Because the Java ecosystem usually gives you an API to everything: you can configure things to work exactly as you want. Everything is programmable and easily hackable.<p>2. Because everything is standardized, which is a lot easier than stitching together lots of pieces, each has to be deployed upgraded, configured, monitored and managed differently.<p>3. Because some Java libraries are used to do very sensitive stuff (performance wise, or correctness wise, or security wise), Java libraries, on average, tend to be of very high quality, at least relative to almost everything else (well, except maybe the Java browser plugin, but we&#x27;re talking server-side here).<p>4. With Capsule there is no need to use a custom class loader, it&#x27;s not any clunkier than Docker, and it&#x27;s cross platform. It&#x27;s just a cross-platform Java executable, which is stateless and requires no installation.",1399636759

I expect to see fewer for-loops than in JavaScript, but I&#x27;d be more forgiving than with Ruby due to having less familiarity with the language.<p>For-loops and if-statements have their place, but too many of them (especially after a couple levels of nesting) makes code hard to read. Different languages have their own answers for this. In Ruby you&#x27;d use polymorphism and higher order functions, while C++ would use polymorphism and iterators.<p>Mind you, all of this is based on your self-professed experience with a language. If you tell me you&#x27;re an expert in Ruby and proceed to write for-loops all over the place then I&#x27;ll be severely unimpressed. If you tell me you&#x27;re mostly a Java developer, but you&#x27;re going to do the interview questions in Ruby because it&#x27;s easier to whiteboard with (and more applicable to the work you&#x27;d be doing at my company) then I&#x27;d be a lot more forgiving.<p>Come to think of it, I think this may explain the perception that older developers have a hard time finding work. I get very excited when I see 20+ years of experience on someone&#x27;s résumé. I assume they&#x27;re going to know all sorts of programming paradigms, algorithms, data structures, languages, techniques, and so on. The problem is that the human brain discards information if it goes unused for too long. As a result, a lot of older devs have a fantastic grasp of the fundamentals because they use them every day, a solid understanding of the one or two languages they use now, and a hazy remembering of a bunch of things they used 5+ years ago. In other words, they&#x27;re a lot like a developer with 5-10 years of experience, except they&#x27;re marginally more well-rounded and have better war stories. That would normally be someone I&#x27;d really want to hire, but it falls so far short of the unrealistic demigods I&#x27;d imagined them to be.",1399635609

But the reason why we created that web service is because of the reasons below:<p>For our clients and our own projects we&#x27;ve switched to using our own servers/VPS&#x27;s.<p>I think PaaS is great for getting simple apps up and running that don&#x27;t have a lot of external dependencies. However, the PaaS I used (Heroku/EngineYard/AWS) don&#x27;t perform good enough compared to VPS or servers at &quot;traditional vendors&quot; or things like DigitalOcean.<p>Also, some of our customers need to have their servers in a geographic location close to home or under national legislation and they don&#x27;t want to be dependent on a &quot;massive&quot; infrastructure where they can&#x27;t just pick up the phone and call someone.<p>Also with local vendors. Problems are usually solved more quickly and communication lines are shorter. You have an answer on a problem much sooner. It also helps that these local vendors do not have massive infrastructures that are hard to fix or hard to move in a short manner of time when something really bad is going on. I have better experience with smaller traditional vendors in fixing problems than I have with &quot;the big guys&quot;.<p>Heroku, for example, is largely dependent on AWS. If AWS fails somewhere, you can&#x27;t just move somewhere else. Because the deployment procedures and infrastructure is vendor-specific to Heroku. You&#x27;re kinda locked in. Addons for external services like Redis, Search daemons, logging, etc. is great for ease of use. But if some of those hip startups die, don&#x27;t get funding or they just have technical/security problems you can&#x27;t &quot;just move away&quot; because you&#x27;re pretty locked in.<p>The above reasons are some main reasons why we moved to 100% of our own servers at local vendors. We have some at DigitalOcean and some at TransIP, which is a Dutch vendor with a long track record and we can by without a credit card with &quot;regular&quot; Dutch payment methods and contracts.<p>The main problem with &quot;do it yourself&quot; servers/VPSs seem to be the time and effort you need to put in to get everything up and running. PaaS services take care of all this for you. This comes at a price both economically and technically. If you&#x27;re fine with that price, than I think PaaS is good for you.<p>If you&#x27;re not &quot;fine&quot; with that price. You run into the problem of reading through guides, documentation, fiddling with your servers, keeping them updated, managing security, etc. etc. All kinds of problems you need to solve.<p>Luckily, there is Managed Hosting at some web services and applications that takes care of all this. There&#x27;s stuff like Plesk, DirectAdmin and such. But they are pretty outdated and not really useful if you&#x27;re a Rails company.<p>Luckily, you can use a service that does server/cloud management for you like Commando.io, IntercityUp.com or Cloud66.<p>Hope this helps!",1399635445

Dynamic content is generated by manipulating and composing the snippets in code. Snippets can be defined in one large HTML file or many files - up to you. The code uses CSS selectors to choose which parts of the HTML to use and transform.<p>For example, lets say I have a blog application:<p><pre><code>    <body>\n        <div>Welcome to my Blog</div>\n        <div id=&quot;posts&quot;>\n            <div class=&quot;post&quot;>\n                <div class=&quot;title&quot;>My post</div>\n                <div class=&quot;content&quot;>Post content here</div>\n                <div class=&quot;comments&quot;>\n                    <div class=&quot;comment&quot;>A comment</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</code></pre>\nThen my code might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    (enlive/defsnippet comment-snippet &quot;myfile.html&quot;\n      [:.comments]\n      [comments]\n      [:.comment] (enlive/clone-for [comment comments\n                    (enlivecontent comment))\n\n    (enlive/defsnippet post-snippet &quot;myfile.html&quot;\n      [:#posts]\n      [posts]\n      [:.post] (enlive/clone-for [{:keys [title content comments} posts]\n                 [:.title]    (enlive/content title)\n                 [:.content]  (enlive/content content)\n                 [:.comments] (comment-snippet comments)))\n</code></pre>\nThat is, parts of snippets are selected and transformed in some way (changing the content, adding/removing css classes or styles, setting attributes, prepending or appending content, wrapping or unwrapping tags, duplicating for each element in a list, etc). This lets you write your page elements as mocked up snippets with dummy data and then merge them together, fill in content, dynamically update attributes and classes all without putting any logic into the HTML.<p>This also makes it very designer friendly because they can work in pure HTML and CSS without worrying about templating - they only need to make sure to follow your basic structure outline (ie making sure your selectors match the right thing).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cgrand/enlive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cgrand/enlive</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/ckirkendall/kioo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ckirkendall/kioo</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/cgrand/enliven"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cgrand/enliven</a>",1399635426

7720228,story,,,1,0,stelian,"I made a web app that makes tweetstorming easier(details in comments)",,"I got the idea for this web app after I saw one of Marc Andreessen&#x27;s famous tweetstorms http://cl.ly/image/2k193q333y1M. At first, I thought he was using some sort of app, but to my surprise, he wasn&#x27;t. So I decided to make one. Where you can write your tweets in the form of an article, each paragraph being a tweet. And each tweet being a reply to the previous one.<p>The technical bits(this is Hacker News, after all):<p>Currently, it&#x27;s runs on Google App Engine. After being a full time designer for the past 9 years, Python is the only server side language I can digest. Also, Twython is a great Twitter API wrapper(https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython).<p>Static files are all stored on Amazon S3 and served through CloudFront. The biggest challenges here were CORS and enabling gzip on S3.<p>Front-end wise this was hell. My brother convinced me that contentEditable is this magical thing that makes rich text editing in the browser a breeze to implement. In theory, that’s true. In practice, I only recommend it to people that are mentally very stable. I also use LocalStorage to keep the written text when the browser tab is closed. This means that, later, you can continue where you left off.<p>Even with all the front-end challenges, it was a fun project to build.<p>TweetEssay: http://www.tweetessay.co/",1399634016

Just patch the suitable GCC or LLVM back end, and recompile the brO-Ser. New processors will be able to have better instruction sets, be tuned for JIT compilation… The Mill CPU architecture for instance, with its low costs for branch mispredictions, already looks like nice target for interpreters.<p>Heh, I hope you appreciate the irony in that one. On the one hand we have people arguing that we have to stick with the existing web platform for backwards compatibility reasons, but on the other you are suggesting it would be easy to switch the entire world to new totally incompatible processor architectures to make aforementioned web platforms performant.",1399633548

7720202,comment,7715901,7717791,1,0,twic,,,"Interesting. I feel much more confident about deploying the right thing using an operating system package than some other mechanism. Almost everything else in the datacentre is deployed using operating system packages, so we get a lot of practice at deploying the right versions of things. The few legacy applications we have that are deployed via custom mechanisms are a headache - they require completely different tooling and troubleshooting knowledge to everything else.<p>But then, i have spent a fair amount of managing machines, shuffling packages around apt repositories, writing Puppet code and so on. Perhaps for a developer who has not served a sentence in operations, operating system packages are a less comforting proposition.<p>You seem to be very keen on avoiding &quot;installation&quot;. Could you tell us about why that is?<p>And could you remind me what the added features of a capsule are? Putting aside the differences in delivery mechanism, which as i&#x27;ve said, i&#x27;m afraid i see as misfeatures, the only one i see is that it automatically finds the right JRE.<p>(Sorry you&#x27;re being downvoted, by the way.

Nowadays linux has progressed enough to bypass that <i>usually</i> - but what about being required to use the terminal just to install?<p>Most users don&#x27;t know what <i>sudo</i>, <i>wget</i>, <i>make</i>, or <i>apt-get</i> commands are, just to start. Most users don&#x27;t know what <i>commands</i> are, in fact. They don&#x27;t care about root access or custom options. They need and expect a graphical wizard to walk them through the core basics of their programs, and even then they shouldn&#x27;t try to perform anything other than the checked box &quot;basic installation&quot;. Perhaps that&#x27;s a better example?<p>Now, you can blame this on third party developers not packaging their applications as handily as they do for Mac or Windows, forcing people to gather and compile sources themselves. But this doesn&#x27;t change the bottom-line - linux is <i>not</i> convenient (which we agree on).<p>And I have used iTunes on Windows, and I found it wasn&#x27;t bloated. It seems to be more or less on par with my Mac to be honest, though frankly I haven&#x27;t used it for that platform except to help other people in the past year.",1371329759

President Obama is, in fact, right that there are choices between the powers of the police and the rights of the citizens. If candidate Obama had ponied up and said sometimes you do have let one guilty man escape, let one cop feel like their &quot;hands are tied&quot; to protect the liberties of Americans, then he&#x27;d have an argument. If candidate Obama had said &quot;yes, there are tradeoffs but the seesaw had clearly moved in a dysfunctional and unbalanced direction that we have to correct&quot;, then you could honestly say he&#x27;s shifted now.  The candidate Obama I saw, was promising anything and everything and thus it&#x27;s not the least bit surprising he is now just doing what&#x27;s convenient. Course, the candidate Obama had a great ability to say things in a way that made people think he&#x27;s saying what you want.<p>Just consider the beauty of candidate Obama&#x27;s, uh, &quot;languaging&quot;, President Obama still opposes illegal wiretaps, right?

The Roundheads in Parliament were ultra-conservative Puritans that wanted to reform British Culture to match their beliefs as sort of a &quot;counter-culture&quot; to what they considered the extravagance/depravity of the Monarchy. Of course not all members of Parliament were Roundheads, but they were stuck until the death of Cromwell in following much of what they demanded. In some ways, no different than the Iranian Revolution (if not reading too far into details).<p>While you are correct in that it involved 2 labels of British Society that had been around for years, the details behind each faction and the changes that the leaders of the side of Parliament wanted to bring were more discontinuous. If Cromwell&#x27;s supporters and his son had been able to hold onto power after his death, I would imagine Great Britain to have changed in some striking ways over the next few centuries.",1371329318

The votes wouldn&#x27;t be just bills, but every action that they voted on, including their working arrangements.<p>For legislation, the columns would have gross bills, whose embedded decisions and regulations could be broken out at will. For example, the Clothing Improvement Bill could be shown on its own (great, my guy voted to improve clothing), and its internals could be broken out to show that, for example, one effect is that citizens and residents of Canadian descent are only allowed to wear red socks (oh, feh, my guy hates Canadians).<p>You could also ask for just the breakouts from all bills that are concerned with socks, for example.<p>Which would be hard, because big bills have lots of individual effects. But it would show exactly what your guy supported, on purpose, unknowingly or as a compromise. Heck, they might even like to see that, they could learn what they voted on after the fact. I&#x27;ll bet a lot of them still don&#x27;t know in total what they voted for in the Affordable Care Act.<p>Each vote would also indicate things like if the member had more responsibility than just being a member, like on the relevant committee. A no-show here should be embarrassing. Or if the vote specifically impacts his region.<p>Bonus points to do this analysis all the way back to the beginning of the Republic.",1371328326

5886155,comment,5882079,5885757,1,0,ics,,,"Admittedly I was asking this here primarily for small business suggestions I certainly wouldn&#x27;t expect a simple provider switch to pull the wool over the NSA&#x27;s eyes. It&#x27;s a silly thought for a business anyway, where the only people you might be trying to hide from are your competitors. As you said, for practical security Google&#x27;s offerings are likely top notch and it gives me no qualms having some accounts with them. That being said, I think there&#x27;s still room for someone to bring almost as much to the table security wise through focus and perhaps a tighter codebase, but beat them out for clear (&quot;fair and decent&quot;) terms in regards to privacy and data handling.<p>Regarding Fastmail, as far as I can tell the new interface is one of the better ones around and it&#x27;s a big help that they provide Yubikey authorization. I&#x27;ve been using Google Authenticator for a while now but in recommending it to others I&#x27;ve found people taking advantage of just about every opportunity to undermine its usefulness (i.e. backup codes not protected or used regularly when their phone is dead, disabling two-factor auth for a few days because they forgot their charger, or sharing app-specific keys...).",1371327126

Why would you agree with that?<p>I strongly agree with you about astroturfing though, and I think it&#x27;s depressing and reprehensible.<p>And, in case I haven&#x27;t made this disclosure in a place where you&#x27;ve read it, I <i>am</i> at this time gainfully employed by Google, and I&#x27;m sure this distorts my thinking.  I really really <i>want</i> to believe that Google is not evil, because if Google is evil than I have to decide if I quit this awesome job, etc etc, and that desire probably has some effect on my judgement.  I encourage everyone to be cautious about everything everyone says, including me.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot of astroturfing on HN, though, if any.  (For one thing, HN is pretty fringe).  But also, the comments never say &quot;don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s all okay&quot;.  Most of the comments raise crazy conspiracy theories, and other ones point out actual holes in crazy conspiracy theories.  Hmn, though there are also people jumping on every most-recent theory that makes things look okay, actually... and that would be good astroturfing, so maybe I take it back.  Actually, upon consideration, if I was the NSA, I&#x27;d post more theories like yours.  Not that I&#x27;m accusing you personally.  (Again, to protect against Poe&#x27;s Law: this paragraph was sincere, not parody.)<p>What I&#x27;d like to see more of, in these discussions about surveillance, is theories putting the facts together in ways that make sense, and theories that are actually consistent with the facts we have.  When you said that that PCWorld link backed up claims of Google-NSA backroom deals, that made no sense.  Just read it.  When you said (in a more-recent comment) that the CIA is invested in many SiVa companies... well, I don&#x27;t agree with your conclusions, but your pattern of reasoning is a lot more plausible.  Partly because you didn&#x27;t go too far, like saying &quot;this proves that Google is just a CIA front company&quot;.  Because it doesn&#x27;t prove much of anything... but it IS part of the set of facts that are interesting.<p>I am perpetually disappointed at how everyone seems to read one or two articles, and feel they have enough facts to stop reading and form an opinion.",1371327112

4663662,comment,4663391,4663391,1,0,masklinn,,,"> During an April interview, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell discussed a project with similar characteristics, describing engines with ""more than 1.5 million pounds"" of thrust.<p>For comparison, 6.7MN (1.5 million pounds) was roughly the thrust of  Saturn V's F-1 engines (it had 5 on first stage and that many J-2  at a mere 4.4MN each  on second stage), and it had an LEO payload quite a bit under those asserted here (120t).<p>Going beyond that means SpaceX is going to compete with the Zenit's RD-171 (~8MN), which is the current holder of ""most powerful liquid-fuel rocket engine"" title (the shuttle boosters are the holder of ""most powerful rocket engine"" title at more than 12MN each).<p>The Merlin page[0] seems to confirm that, suggesting the Merlin 2 is planned for around 8.5MN. That's absolutely enormous.<p>You still have to wonder how many of these things they'll put on a rocket to get it to push the expected 200t to LEO: the original Energia only lifted 100t to LEO with 4 zenit boosters (so 4xRD-170) and its own engines (4xRD-0120 at 2MN each), there were plans to have a 200t-lifting Energia by strapping <i>8</i> zenits to it<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(rocket_engine)#Merlin_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(rocket_engine)#Merlin_2</a>",1350464085

(Kinda like an election with two lame candidates.)  That is the challenge.  We're better to work with what evolution has equipped us than to ignore it.  We have to be realistic.
Dare I say it?  We occasionally need to be _reasonable_.  (Hello Apple.)<p>If I understand you correctly this time, you're saying we would have gotten a better deal if Microsoft had not been able sue competitors.  Even the Gates Foundation, with all its billions, can't manage to achieve world peace or universal equality.<p>I read Maskin's paper from 1999.  His basic premise was that software didn't need patents to reach a high level of success as an industry.  And when the rampant software patenting started, he says it did not boost the industry.  But he seems to think that this example of one industry sums up the entire role of the patent system, for any industry.  Still not sure I buy that.  If he has done his homework on other industries, e.g. pharmaceuticals, he is not showing it in that paper.  Maybe I need to read more of his papers.",1350463795

I also am involved with oxygen+hydrogen rocket propulsion research but can't really discuss it much here. But things have come on a bit in the last 30 years :)<p>Re: 'BFR', well I have a few hypotheses about 'MCT' in a similar vein but I reasoned they might be a little bit blue for HN!<p>Edit: A better reason for first stage hydrogen occured to me over a cup of tea:<p>> ""SpaceX has always made the (correct, IMHO) decision to optimise the cost-efficiency of their rockets, rather than the propulsion efficiency, and hopefully they won't stray from that path.""<p>I think the economics change when you try and go reusable in the way that they are. Lox Hydrogen engines and tankage <i>might</i> be more expensive, which is obviously a factor in an expendable vehicle, but if you reuse the vehicle, and have to keep enough fuel back to land, as SpaceX plan, I think actually the equation goes far more back towards optimising for propulsion efficiency in order to get the cost efficiency. The launcher cost metric is basically dollars per kg into orbit, and for a given <i>reusable</i> rocket, lox+hydrogen will get many more kgs into orbit than lox+kerosene - you need to keep much less fuel back in reserve to land the various rocket stages, and the extra fuel you can use on the ascent is also a lot more thrusty per unit mass. I wouldn't be surprised, assuming you sell at a dollar/kg price, if lox+hydrogen ended up being much more profitable in reusables than lox+kerosene, everything else being equal. I have not done the sums though.",1350463699

4663648,comment,4663511,4663511,10,0,antihero,,,"This is complete bunk.<p>Why? Because firstly, IQ is flawed because it fails to take into account different forms of intelligence - for instance, an African living in the bush may not be as good linguistically, but will be a far more ""intelligent"" hunter than the average western person. IQ tests have been <i>repeatedly</i> criticised for failing to adapt to cultural differences, and are effectively geared towards a western understanding of human intelligence - essentially, it's like comparing a long jumper and a sprinter, having them both sprint, and then declaring the sprinter is a better all-round sportsman.<p>Religion could also be linked to, for instance, poverty or desperate conditions. It's all very well sitting back in our cities with power and relatively good pay and oodles of free time, philosophising to ourselves and declaring that god could not possible exist, but for people in packed, impoverished slums, religions serves as a motivator, either by being the only thing that gives people hope, or principally because one is taught it at a young age and doesn't have the time or education to question it with science or reason. This has nothing to do with a ""lack of intelligence"". Religion is also a much greater part of society - think about England several hundred years ago - many of the great minds were religious, simply because it was just the given thing to be, it was the Zeitgeist.<p>Apologies for the aggressive tone, but this study just reeks of cultural imperialism and sneering at others without really attempting to understand anything.",1350463656

4663645,comment,4663511,4663511,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Well, religion (mythology) is the result of humans not understanding something and attempting to explain it using fantasy elements. Which is very normal and natural.<p>So if a society currently lacks the education or intelligence to understand complex scientific principals of course they're going to use fantasy to try to understand the world around them. Once people understand the world around them using non-fantasy or non-religious explanations, they usually abandon religion.<p>The way I see it, science and religion are just 2 different ways of achieving ""understanding"". All humans want answers, and will get those answers using which ever method, science or religion, they have access to (sometimes both).<p>So apparently:<p>- Religion causes people to have low IQs (No)<p>- People who are religious are usually of a lower intelligence (Not really)<p>- People who are of a lower intelligence usually tend to be more religious (Yes, usually)<p>- Some people are both very intelligent and very religious (Yes)<p>If these observations are true, how much of society will be offended by them?",1350463510

That's really a huge increase in terms of what you can launch with a given size of rocket.<p>Tom Mueller, the head of propulsion at SpaceX, previously worked for TRW (the company that did the US's ICBMs in the 50s) and while there he worked on a LOX+Hydrogen engine, the TR106 ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-106"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-106</a> ), which was a beast.<p>It's harder to work with - both propellants are very cryogenic - but any rocket engine designer will be very aware that LOX+Hydrogen is hovering at the top of the evolutionary ladder looking mighty attractive for those that have the resources to take it on - a position Space X find itself in as they become more mature and heavyweight. They're already looking at it for their replacement Upper stage vacuum engine for Falcon 9 - the Raptor ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(rocket_stage)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(rocket_stage)</a> ).<p>Also, almost any Mars mission would involve a lot of heavy lifting into low earth orbit to construct a vehicle that would transport people there and back. A space vehicle that can support several people for say 2 years, and move itself to and from Mars, is going to by way bigger than anything that can be launched by a single rocket all at once. A big heavy-lifter whose engines have a much improved Isp (which rather relaxes the expensive mass saving measures you need in the rest of the rocket to launch a given payload, or alternatively lets you launch a much heavier payload for the same vehicle) is consistant with a mars road map.<p>I doubt they would undertake something like this <i>just</i> for Mars - developing rocket engines is hecka expensive. SpaceX got started by inheriting most of the cancelled FastTrac project from Nasa ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastrac_(engine)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastrac_(engine)</a> ) and indeed still outsource their turbopumps (the hardest bit of an engine) to Barber Nichols, who did the design for Fastrac. That was a great move on their part - starting with a blank sheet would have been madly expensive and very slow - a working baseline engine design is a very high-dimensional optimisation problem, before you even get to cutting metal. My point is, if they're now starting clean-sheet engine design, I'm sure they must have in mind some way for it to pay for itself because it's a hugely costly business.<p>We live in interesting times!",1350462483

I find it intuitive in the way that Unix pipes are intuitive. A few other languages have this also but Dart is one of them and its a plus.<p>Optional Typing: Its a dynamic language so its very flexible. Some statically typed languages are also flexible but you can still run into some very complex cases with the type system. I want to focus on my application. By having optional types though I can get 80% of what static, strong typing gives me, namely documentation, the ability to quickly reverse engineer someone else's code and runtime type checks. You know all those unit tests that you write in a dynamically typed language just to check the type of some parameter? With Dart you just turn on a switch and those unit tests are built in (I don't think typescript gives you this as the type information is erased at runtime)<p>Native debugger: I want my apps to run everywhere which means generating javascript. I see the Dart VM as a native debugging environment. Google have built a special VM so that I can debug Dart natively. I don't think source maps will be able to give as rich a debugging experience.<p>Tree shaking: The size of javascript libraries is a big issue. Have you tried looking at some sites over a slow mobile connection? Tree shaking looks like it will make it possible to only pay for what you use. This is a major plus<p>A consistent core: How many javascript libraries are there? Which should I pick? I don't even want to pick anymore I just want to get on with the job.<p>A pretty good experience: Rob Pike had an article a while ago about people complaining about a language without using it.

Great thing actually. Instead of hitting start and fumbling with the mouse to find a certain app, you just start typing the app name, press Enter and done.<p>""Start-up screen is kind of overwhelming and inefficient"". 
The new start screen is basically a launcher + notification. You can always turn live tiles off and get a static screen.<p>""Some of the features are hidden and require a lot of exploring to get it right""
Win+C to show the charms bar, win+shift+. to dock/undock app to right side. No need to even move the mouse.",1350461156

Some religions are anti-knowledge (at least for woman and specific minorities). In Western Europe religious schools (Catholic, Protestant etc) are known to teach at a higher level. In my area they are in high demand due to the quality of their education, even for non-religious parents. (The level of ""fanatic"" religion is not high here).",1350461154

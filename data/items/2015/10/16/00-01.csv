So if no clients are hosting the full, complete blockchain then you won&#x27;t be able to sync at all, which will be bad for everyone.<p>You could theoretically get around this by starting sync from a known (hard coded) recent block + UXTO set, but at that point you are losing _all_ transaction history, not just your OP_RETURNs.

Government &quot;charity&quot; consumes about 70 percent of the money in bureaucratic overhead. Private charity overheads are typically below 30 percent, and much better in many cases.  What you want is more money in the pockets of people so that they can give more to charity. Any dollar spent on voluntary charity vs taxes is much more efficiently used to help the needy directly. If you really care about poor people you should want more money going directly to private charities not the government. In fact, private charities were a much bigger part of day to day society before the welfare state and poverty was decreasing between the 40s and 60s. When the government steps in it changes people&#x27;s behaviour and takes away more and more of their disposable income. I know you&#x27;ll find this hard to believe but its true the richest in our society give more than anyone else to charity.",1444956819

However, I think that a defining differentiator is that a basic income can assist in luxury assistance beyond pure help. That is to say, if we offer purely assistive programs that are arguably <i>necessary</i> to a subset of the population (such as healthcare), it is clearly fundamentally unfair, but arguably morally net positive. If however, you offer a check that the person can use at their discretion (and thus <i>choose</i> to for example use it for vacation or gambling or any purpose they choose), then it is unfair and morally questionable. I think this is obvious.<p>Separately, I do not think it is unfair description at all, but rather an objective measure of the service proposed, as opposed to a subjective one from thethe population that stands to gain vs the population that stands to lose. I have listed scenarios that I think are fundamentally unfair: young able-bodied members of society with no dependents receiving aid whereas older members of society that have dependents would not. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me that &quot;we already&quot; do unfair things, this point has not been at all addressed. Existing wrongs are not arguments for new wrongs.<p>Additionally, regardless of whether you agree with the fundamental morality of these situations, I think you can&#x27;t argue with proposed consequences. I think that this system will absolutely make immigration harder in the US (through increased &quot;protective&quot; insular policies to keep &quot;freeloaders&quot; out), and thus hurt the economy as a whole.",1444956453

IMHO the main thing to keep in mind is who immediately gets money as a direct consequence of a policy change, what they feel obligated to do with it, and how that might turn into a bottleneck later.<p>Traditionally when money is &quot;pumped into&quot; a economy, it&#x27;s via lending to banks(producing a &quot;multiplier&quot; effect). That money lands in the hands of the biggest capital-holders first - big businesses, investment firms, etc., so it acts to stimulate supply more than demand. The hope is that firms will see the easy money as a signal to expand their operations and take on bigger projects. If it doesn&#x27;t work - and efforts like QE have basically stopped working - all you&#x27;re going to get is greater inequality of wealth, as the money stops being put to use and feeds itself back into the capital markets.<p>And when we stimulate demand in the fashion done in the post-war era, with a huge expansion of government spending, the money is mostly landing on people building war machines and associated technologies. People are being employed and paid, but they&#x27;re locked into employment of a certain nature which isn&#x27;t directed at consumers - so more money is chasing a broadly similar basket of goods. The late 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s saw rapid inflation, and the technical advances and new markets that opened up from that period to today are pretty much all rooted in that early investment in military R&D.<p>On the other hand, when you have money land directly into the hands of consumers, that money is only skewed by cultural values. They could go Kickstart some wacky project. They could push for higher quality goods. They could pay off debts, change residences, and go back to school. Consumers aren&#x27;t purely profit-seeking or utilitarian - how the macro situation would change is one huge unknown, but the main point of appeal is that it would be a very fluid kind of demand, and if consumers start disliking their ROI in one category, they can smoothly transition to something else - which means the traps and bottlenecks of other policy changes may not apply.",1444955117

Granted, with the amount of people against immigration maybe it would actually help these arguments, but the truth is that such a plan can be potentially devastating to the long term health of the economy (if you know, these dreams of the end of scarcity don&#x27;t pan out).<p>The basic problem here is that these plans mis-consider the US as an isolated economy. If you have basic income, what is the policy on immigrants? The options appear to be:<p>1. Open immigration and same benefits to everyone. Maybe you can argue that we can afford basic income for current US citizens, I think it would be a stretch for anyone to argue that we could afford it for anyone that comes into our borders, and thus...<p>2. Get even more hard line against immigration. America is already pretty anti-immigration, just wait how opinions turn when anyone inside gets a guaranteed income. As usual, anti-immigration laws will hurt the next round of brilliant foreigners from coming to the US and bringing their great ideas and prosperity here. Its already the case that we&#x27;re increasingly lending foreigners our education system and then not letting them stay and thus exporting that knowledge and prosperity.<p>3. Make basic income only available to US citizens. Congratulations, we have now fully devolved into a classist society, where an 18 year old that wants to &quot;figure things out&quot; will be granted a monthly salary, but an immigrant who has 3 kids won&#x27;t. To make matters worse, they probably WILL pay taxes on their income that will go for said basic income. Arguably we have this partially now, but since its services its not as unfair as giving a check to someone by birthright while the other person has to labor. For all the talk of automation the reality on the streets <i>today</i> is that immigrants largely do our back braking labor, and if you now &quot;buy out&quot; all Americans from menial jobs, you are cementing that these tasks are for outsiders.<p>Milton Friedman put it best: you can&#x27;t have open immigration and a welfare state. We already see the effects of our current system hurting immigration. These proposals always have the ring of &quot;post history&quot; to them: we&#x27;ve <i>figured out supply</i>, now its time to just find out how to split up the goods.

I fundamentally agree with his goals of supporting free discussion and suppressing self-censorship.  However, I see several problems with this approach to achieving those goals.<p>The core problem with social-capital type schemes like Reddit (or indeed HN) is that they&#x27;re very susceptible to bandwagoning.  On Reddit the groupthink varies by community, but there&#x27;s some mixing bowls and as a result the community does have an overall balance, despite having some short-term bandwagons.  HN has a really strong bent towards the opinions of 20-something Silicon Valley startup coders without much counterbalance, and I know that I&#x27;ve certainly self-censored on certain topics that go against the grain here.  Yes, in the words of Drew Carry, &quot;everything is made up and the points don&#x27;t matter&quot;, but then why is there still a counter in the corner of my screen?<p>Here, you&#x27;re literally talking about putting a pricetag on dissenting opinions.  If you go against the grain you&#x27;re not just getting downvoted, each post actually costs you a certain amount of real money on servicing the blockchain.  Conversely, circlejerking will get you a lot of kudos.  That is - in and of itself - a strong social pressure that hampers the full spectrum of discourse.  Much like the Bitcoin blockchain, it is fundamentally based on the assumption that no one group controls a non-trivial portion of the [social] network.<p>The same mechanisms that work against reprisal or spam also work against opinions that dissent from the common wisdom.  It&#x27;s vitally important for a strong discourse that sometimes-unpopular opinions be heard.  Otherwise it&#x27;s far too easy for the majority to carry themselves along (the Iraq war immediately springs to mind).  I don&#x27;t know how you counterbalance that against suppressing actual spam - because botnets and such mean that those groups will also have a great deal of capital from blockchain/network operation.<p>Some of the best communities on the web have actually been gated ones.  Back in the day it cost $10 to activate an account on SomethingAwful.  If you trolled, well, at least you&#x27;re helping pay for the servers.  If you leech on private trackers, you get banned and someone else takes a hit for inviting you.  Gated NZB sites work in a similar way.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with such communities at all, but fundamentally they work on the basis of clearly defined social standards.  On the flip side, Twitter and Tumblr have a very low level of discourse, because it&#x27;s all about pithy soundbytes that get you retweeted.  People leech from ThePirateBay all the time, because from their perspective, why not?<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is different from &quot;twitter, but using bitcoin&quot;.  Something like FreeNet seems to accomplish the above goals much more effectively - popular opinions result in distributed re-caching, unpopular ones still get served if they have sufficient traffic, and <i>really</i> unpopular ones can be broadcasted by vigorous network participation and re-seeding.",1444954069

Result: they all drag their feet one way or the other, each release breaks all sorts of stuff, and so on.<p>That&#x27;s because interoperability with competitors is NOBODY&#x27;S PRIORITY when all actors are well-established (the youngest browser engine is khtml/webkit, started in 1998; seen any new engine recently? Didn&#x27;t think so.). In fact, the largest the market-share, the greater the incentive to add <i>more</i> incompatibilities in order to keep your lock-in as strong as possible.<p>So yeah, CSS can be maddening, and in many ways it&#x27;s not entirely succeeded (you mention mobile, that was quite a failure), but it wasn&#x27;t because of problems with the standard itself, or at least not entirely.",1444953792

Only reason I have it now is that my roommate is locked into a contract for a few more months (cancellation fee is greater than just playing out the string, and there are some small convenience benefits, particularly for sports). However, we&#x27;ll be cutting that cord in December for good. I&#x27;ve had a Mohu Leaf, Roku, and a Chromecast for 3 years (OTA, apps, mirroring), and to be honest, the only things missing for me are Pac-12 Network and TNT (which only matters for select NBA games, anyway). Now that SlingTV offers TNT, Pac-12 Network is really the only thing I&#x27;m aware of that isn&#x27;t legally available without cable.",1444953757

That can be sometimes hard while at work, so I end up going out to lunch with them or occasionally grab a beer afterwards.<p>2) While at lunch or after work, my team and I end up talking about random stuff, but it pays off when you can sense if someone is having a bad day/week or is stuck on a particular issue. Also helps to build mutual trust with your team and keeps the communication lines more open.<p>3) It&#x27;s hard to sometimes tell how well you&#x27;re doing as a technical lead, but one way I do it is by how often people come to me for help to things that can&#x27;t easily be Googled. If developers are seeking out your help, they trust you and consider you reliable source of help.<p>4) If it comes down to doing more work or helping your team. Always pick your team. Helping them will likely be more productive overall than any amount of additional work you take on yourself.<p>5) Every developer is different. Recognize that when communicating with them and approach each differently. A true tech lead isn&#x27;t a managing position, it&#x27;s a mentoring/leadership role while still being a developer.<p>6) Be concise. Your team needs help, but they have work to do. Save the long explanations for later. That doesn&#x27;t mean you should avoid the &quot;why&quot; in your responses, just don&#x27;t make your answers a monologue.<p>7) If asked by a team member why you think a particular approach or solution is correct, give them an explanation. I always feel if I can&#x27;t explain a particular subject, then I don&#x27;t really know it that well and may be incorrect.<p>8) You don&#x27;t always have to be correct. Admitting you aren&#x27;t when you can&#x27;t explain something reflects better than all other responses you could give your team.<p>9) Making yourself available to your team for assistance is also a must as already mentioned. Everyone communicates differently, so adjust to your team as much as possible.<p>10) Don&#x27;t deter someone outright from pursuing a potential solution, even if you&#x27;re pretty certain it won&#x27;t work. Instead saying no, apply some rubber duck debugging[1] and talk them through their idea aloud. If all goes well, they&#x27;ll either realize it&#x27;s not feasible and learn the value of communication or they&#x27;ll convince you that it will likely work. If they win me over, I&#x27;ll try to help them devise a way to small way to test their idea further.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging</a>",1444953752

They lead to financial ruin and in the long run will cause disaster for the generation holding the bag.<p>- They increase the amount of force and coercion; suddenly using welfare as a weapon, the left can increase the size of government, the right can increase the size of the military (I do not differentiate between Veterans welfare from the VA or civilian welfare).<p>- They take money from those that produce and give it to those that do not<p>And I haven&#x27;t even gotten into the economic issues with a basic income guarantee.<p>You notice that whenever the government gets involved in an industry, those costs immediately go up?

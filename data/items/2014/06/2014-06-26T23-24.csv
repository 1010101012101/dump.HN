I also have access to lots of really interesting data (I work for a really large retailer and can access 100% of our chat transcripts, for instance).  It makes me really interested in text analysis, clustering, etc, and while there are other languages that seem like they might make more sense, pragmatically, this would be a side track and I think using haskell would be more interesting for myself, especially if I end up doing most of the work on it in my spare time, as kind of a for-fun but useful project.<p>Good luck with your data.

California (the Office of Administrative Law) doesn&#x27;t even have possession of the codified regulations they make (the California Code of Regulations).

The fact that we get to take advantage of a DoD-built fleet of dozens of satellites that are constantly broadcasting extremely accurate times is pretty extravagant. Google can build systems today that rely on clocks in data-centers thousands of miles apart both being very close to &quot;absolute&quot; time, with explicit, conservative bounds on their error, in part through heavy use of GPS clocks. But for most of us that don&#x27;t have an elaborate system of fancy clocks in our data-centers, Lamport&#x27;s approach of having machines update one another&#x27;s clocks (be they logical or physical) as they exchange messages is still a lot more relevant.",1403825195

7952011,comment,7951082,7951082,0,0,jameshart,,,"This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;primer&#x27; about Technical debt - it&#x27;s an opinionated piece about the value of the concept of technical debt, which I think is at least a 102 or possibly 201 level course on the subject, and needs to be taken in the context of other material. I suspect it hasn&#x27;t been tested out on many nontechnical managers, either - using the concept of electron spin (for a nontechnical audience, remember) as an analogy for the concept of analogies is the kind of meta-analysis that I think will lose them pretty early on.<p>I think the real problem of this piece is that it flatters nontechnical managers, as businesspeople, by describing technical debt as a sensible business decision they can get into consciously through clearheaded negotiation with their technical team; then characterizes &#x27;bad code&#x27; as something different, that happens when the technical team just don&#x27;t do their job. This alleviates the nontechnical manager of any responsibility for bad code. The fact is that knowing about technical debt is not necessary to find yourself up to your neck in it. A team which goes for years taking shortcuts, being forced to hit unrealistic deadlines, or which lacks the skills to really build a good, robust system, is like a kid with a credit card who doesn&#x27;t get that just paying the minimum payment each month isn&#x27;t going to work forever. Every shortcut they get asked to take, they swipe the card, and they get to walk out of the store with the goods, and it seems to just keep on working; thousands of dollars worth of stuff, and they just have to pay a few hundred each month. It&#x27;s magic!<p>But the consequences will show up in the end, either in the form of a long period of hard graft to pay it down, or declaring bankruptcy and abandoning the codebase.<p>That&#x27;s why I love the technical debt analogy - different people manage financial debt differently, and most businesspeople understand the concept that planned debt is necessary and beneficial for growth; arguing that Ward Cunningham and the author don&#x27;t think you should call other technical debt by that name seems petty, and not particularly useful, when extending the analogy to runaway debts works so well.<p>Overall the problem I really have with this piece is that if I tell a manager &quot;This project is carrying a bunch of technical debt,&quot; now they&#x27;ll google it, find this, and come back to me with &quot;You mean it&#x27;s a pile of bad code.&quot; Which is true, but how does that help us? When I make the argument that a troubled project needs to pay down some technical debt, I&#x27;m trying to make clear that we need to start paying off more than just the minimum payment every month. If the technical debt analogy is removed from the table, I&#x27;m left with just saying the team needs to replace the bad code with good code. And then they&#x27;ll tell me that this piece also told them that the &#x27;big rewrite&#x27; was a bad idea too... So how has this helped?",1403824424

I like a lot about the way the language is laid out, and whenever I watch one of Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks I find myself instinctively wanting to sell all my possessions and walk the earth handing out &quot;Data is Code, Code is Data&quot; tracts. The few times it&#x27;s seemed like Clojure might be a good fit for something small, I&#x27;ve ended up using Racket (for whatever reason I find all the infrastructure around writing and deploying Racket to be less cumbersome than all of Clojure&#x27;s Java-ness)<p>So far, I&#x27;ve written all the &quot;collection&quot; type stuff in my system in Haskell, and I&#x27;m glad I ignored everyone&#x27;s hemming and hawing about it, because it was actually a really pleasant experience. Now that I&#x27;m gathering a lot of disparate data, I&#x27;m in the &quot;what the hell do I do with it?&quot; phase of my project. I&#x27;m trying to resist sucking it all into Hadoop (partly because I&#x27;m a one-person operation and even a small Hadoop cluster would be larger than all of the systems that are generating the data that I&#x27;m monitoring, and partly because I can keep about a years worth of data comfortably in memory).<p>So I&#x27;m basically using this as an opportunity to try out whatever kinds of data analysis I think sound interesting, and then hopefully learning what is a good fit and what isn&#x27;t. This is all uncharted territory for me, and I&#x27;m fortunate to be in a position where I can do what I want and don&#x27;t have any time pressures.<p>I figure I can try to use this data to learn about statistical modeling, graph analysis, and machine learning. For the time being, I&#x27;m favoring Haskell for this, but that&#x27;s not really any type of requirement.

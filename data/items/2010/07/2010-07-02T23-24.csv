Now... now I'm afraid that I'll get tagged by other people in facebook (even though I'm not part of it anymore) and facebook will of course make money by selling all the facial patterns to third parties.<p>The applications of facial recognition make my mind fly, they remind me of Minority Report and marketers recognizing you wherever you go, it makes me think of even more divorces based on far more evidence that will be automatically available on social networks.<p>I think I'll start wearing some make-up a few months from now, or turn my face away every time I see a camera.

2) In the USA people are innocent until proven guilty<p>Now if you're interested in this case, read on...<p>There are hundreds of independent yellow pages (including Yellow Pages United) that legally use the term Yellow Pages and the ""walking fingers"" logo. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Pages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Pages</a><p>My partners have been doing direct mail and publishing a real, actual, yellow pages ""Business Book"" for something like 10 years. I've personally known them for almost 4 years and they're not crooks. They are important figures in the community and employ a few dozen people here. Their legal counsel for compliance with postal regulations is some of the best in the business and they have been operating without ever having any fear of being subject to criminal fraud prosecution.<p>Their detention hearing was today. After 5 hours of testimony the federal judge from Florida's Middle District decided to release Mark, Marian and Chris on bond, basically disagreeing with the Atlanta court's request. What I witnessed during the hearing was political grandstanding, a run-amok federal prosecutor trying to make a name for himself and sheer cluelessness on behalf of the government. A ton of ""facts"" in the criminal complaint simply don't make any sense. For instance, they claim that the FTC consumer complaint database has over 100,000 issues in it related to United Directories. That is plainly false and we heard testimony in court today that the FTC regularly investigates companies once they exceed 5-10 complaints. That the FTC would ignore 100 thousand complaints over the course of 5 years is complete bullshit.<p>Also, the $425MM figure being widely quoted in the news is based on deposits figures from United Directories' (UD) sweep account. SWEEP ACCOUNT. They summed up all the money ever deposited into the UD sweep account and spent hours claiming that the money had disappeared. It hadn't disappeared -- it never existed in the first place!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_account"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_account</a><p>In an almost funny episode, the federal prosecutor admitted he did not know what a sweep account was, later calling the explanation ""trickery"" on the part of the defense.<p>There's so much more to this case than what the media is reporting and we're going to do our best to make sure that our side of the story, the truth, is heard. All of Hashrocket is pretty distraught, but we'll do our best to soldier on and support our friends in whatever way possible.",1278115026

We do things backwards here.<p>EDIT: skushch's reply below made a good clarification. When I originally read that portion of the article I didn't realize that was the argument made. I just saw how the very 1st solution recommended was that the EPA should allow more oil in the water, which was hilarious and consistent with many other ""pro-pollution/pro-greed"" efforts I've seen from The Right in past years, and I reacted to that. So on this single narrow point I think the article <i>does</i> make sense: we <i>should</i> temporarily drop any rule that commits the error of letting the quest for perfection be the enemy of the good enough now. The overall article I still think is an attack piece with highly cherry-picked statements and convenient blinders on.",1278114941
1482785,comment,1482581,1482581,0,0,zweben,,,"I would love this as much as any other web designer or developer, but sadly, it's just not feasible.<p>The biggest problem with upgrades is that lots of companies rely on specific versions of specific browsers for in-house websites and web apps.  Expiration dates essentially amount to browser makers saying 'too bad, fix your software'. This would be amusing, but realistically, Microsoft would never do such a thing, and without Microsoft on board, not much will change.<p>The best compromise I can think of is for browser vendors to decouple updates of web-technology support (HTML, CSS, JS, Canvas, etc.) from updates of user-facing features, the things that get advertised when an full point upgrade is released, and start pushing out HTML, CSS and JS upgrades automatically, in the background.  Once the first round of such browsers were widely adopted, browser upgrades would cease to be an issue at all.  Upgrade averse users could keep their old versions with familiar interfaces and still have cutting edge standards support.<p>This leaves the problem of getting the first round of upgrades through, but that could be solved by building in backwards compatibility for all currently popular version of a browser. This would be a pain, but would only have to happen once.  If Microsoft, for example, gave IE9 full backwards compatibility with IE8, 7 and 6, and made future rendering updates automatic, there would be very little excuse left for any company to stick with an older version of IE.",1278114931

   * The types of spammers include: playback bots, form-filling bots, and
   * humans. This script reduces automated form submission from both bot
   * types.
   *
   * CAPTCHA failure: xrumer (http://www.botmasternet.com/) DeCaptcher
   * (http://decaptcher.com/client/), http://allbots.info/, and
   * CAPTCHA bypass (http://www.guruperl.net/products/captcha-bypass/).
   *
   * =======================================================================
   * Playback Bots
   * =======================================================================
   * Playback bots take data that has already been submitted against a form
   * and continue to resubmit it.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Hash a timestamp, IP address, and browser name within hidden
   * input fields, encrypted with a password.
   *
   * =======================================================================
   * Form-filling Bots
   * =======================================================================
   * These bots mechanically fill in form fields.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Honeypot fields. Hidden from users using CSS, the input field
   * is not displayed to human users, but shows up for bots. The field should
   * shift its order randomly (relative to the valid fields).
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Misnamed fields. Randomize the names of fields. Record the
   * real names within a hidden input field.
   *
   * =======================================================================
   * Humans
   * =======================================================================
   * There is no way to prevent a human from spamming you. However, you can
   * use JavaScript to make the submit button disabled for a short time.
   * (Like the time it would take a human to fill in all their contact
   * details.)
   *
   * Weakness: Double submissions. Disable the submit button using JavaScript
   * once the user has clicked submit.
   *
   * =======================================================================
   * All Bots
   * =======================================================================
   * [X] Weakness: Timestamp fields. The time between generating the form
   * and submitting the form must be after a minimum number of seconds (5),
   * but no longer than a certain number of minutes. TIMEOUT page.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Session variable. This ensures that the form was posted
   * from the website, not remotely POSTed. See: session_start(),
   * session_destroy(), and unset.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Cookie variable. This also ensures that the form was posted
   * from the website, not remotely POSTed. See: session_start(),
   * session_destroy(), and unset.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Word count. The number of distinct words (characters
   * separated by spaces) must be above a certain count.
   *
   * Weakness: Duplicate data. All form data must be unique.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: HTTP REFERER. When the page is initially loaded, the HTTP
   * REFERER is added as a hidden, encrypted field. The value must be the
   * same as when the form is submitted.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Email address. The email's doman must have an
   * MX record in a non-bogus IP-space. See: checkdnsrr( doman, ""MX"" )
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Links. Comments can only have one website link.
   *
   * [X] Weakness: Strip HTML. Comments are stripped of HTML tags.

Most web frameworks are wed to an overall philosophy for creating web applications. Rails is unlikely to depart from the MVC pattern for example. If you agree with that you can see that Rails, and any other framework I can think of, can at best hope to strive for a local maximum, unless their overall approaches are eventually validated as <i>the</i> way to do things, but I find that very unlikely.<p>I like the idea of web frameworks using functional languages, largely because I believe a framework written in a functional language will be better capable of adapting to new advances.

1482668,comment,1482389,1482574,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Keyspace is replicated; when consistent, every node has a complete copy of the data.  Cassandra distributes the keyspace across many nodes; in a reasonably-sized cluster a node will have only a fraction of the data.  A write-heavy workload will scale horizontally with Cassandra but will probably be as slow as the slowest server in the cluster with keyspace.<p>Cassandra is tolerant of partitions in the cluster; if communication between two parts of a cluster are cut off, read and write operations that don't demand consistency will not fail.  Keyspace has ""dirty"" reads that will continue to return inconsistent data when this occurs but all write operations require a majority of nodes to be up and in communications with one another.<p>Cassandra's data model is more sophisticated than Keyspace's.  You can have multiple column families (essentially, namespaces) in Cassandra that can be ordered arbitrarily, given a plugin to compare two keys.  Supercolumns are (this is a very simplified explanation) columns with tuples (key1, key2) as keys.  Keyspace is a simple key/value store.<p>Both Cassandra and Keyspace support ranged gets; Cassandra supports multi-gets of a list of arbitrary keys as well.  Keyspace supports increment and compare-and-swap operations that Cassandra does not.<p>Cassandra is used in production by a good number of places; I don't know who, if anyone, is using Keyspace.<p>All my knowledge of Keyspace comes from reading the thorough and clear whitepaper they offer at <a href=""http://scalien.com/pdf/Keyspace.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalien.com/pdf/Keyspace.pdf</a>.",1278111617

The &quot;paradox&quot; is introduced by silent assumption that distribution of amounts put in envelopes is uniform which is impossible (because you can&#x27;t pick numbers from infite set uniformly even if there was infinite amount of money in &quot;adversary&quot; disposal). The assumption is then used for conditional probability calculations: &quot;if we see 10$ there is 50% chance the other envelope contains 20$&quot; - BEEP, ERROR, THINK AGAIN.<p>Perhaps good exercise in clear thinking but not really a paradox.\nGood analogy is this:\n&quot;If we pick random building and climb to the roof of it there is 50% chance first building we see is higher than the one we just climbed&quot;. This is obviously true, now following &quot;paradoxical&quot; reasoning we get:\n&quot;If we climb a building randomly and see it&#x27;s the Empire State Building there is still 50% chance first building we see will be higher&quot;.<p>This is exact analogy to reasoning about 2 envelopes problem which is supposed to lead to a paradox.",1379195764

6387184,comment,6366452,6371161,1,0,Dewie,,,"> Yes, I was referring to the time and space complexities of actually calculating the values. If the pure function were the algorithm, then there would be no separating the two. However, since a pure function can be calculated by several algorithms, then we are really just putting off some of the major points, no? (Hell, even in the simple 8 * 2, we are glossing over what really happens.<p>Again: both imperative and functional algorithms can be implemented in several ways. Both imperative and functional algorithms can solve the same problem, but have different time complexities.<p>&quot;However, since a pure function can be calculated by several algorithms, then we are really just putting off some of the major points, no?&quot;<p>What? The semantics of a pure function shouldn&#x27;t be changed when you actually compute it - there is no &quot;functional algorithm execution algorithm&quot;. The actual code that gets evaluated <i>can</i> be pretty different from the actual code you wrote, though - maybe your lazy lists got implemented as for-loops. Maybe you used a list in some way that made it look like you had O(n) space complexity, but it got turned into a loop that didn&#x27;t store intermediate values so the space complexity is actually O(1). So yes, time complexity can be a little decieving, in some cases, if the compiler is sufficiently smart. However, there is no magic about the actual semantics of a functional algorithm.<p>> This is all really missing my main assertion, though. What is your function for getting in your car and driving somewhere? Could this be written in such a way that everything was a &quot;pure&quot; function? Probably. My hunch is that it wouldn&#x27;t really be that readable, though. Now, if we shift the paradigm such that one of the &quot;primitives&quot; is your current location, suddenly the directions are a lot more readable.<p>Maybe you could. I don&#x27;t think many care, though, not even functional programmers. The only decently widespread language that I can think of that actually enforces purity is Haskell, and some people even prefer to write imperative code in it over other languages. I don&#x27;t get this obsession of yours with trying to argue against pure functional programming in the very, very strict sense of the <i>whole</i> program being pure, if that is actually possible. I think there are very few that are upset about having to write imperative code for code that has to do with sequential commands. They might use pure functional programming for the computations that they need, but they&#x27;ll effectively write imperative programs at the top level.<p>What they probably do want, though, is to be able to clearly distinguish what parts of their programs are pure and what parts of their programs are potentially effectful.",1379195196

Here&#x27;s a &quot;cached&quot; version.<p>To all watchers of the libgdx repository: im terribly sorry and hope i didnt interfer with your work in any way<p>This is meant as a cautionary tale about using Githubs API on a repository with quite a few watchers (460 in this case).<p>Earlier this year we migrated our code from Google Code to Github. We didnt have a good migration plan for the 1200 or so issues back then, so we kept them on Google Code. We now have about 1700 issues on the tracker<p>Today i finally wanted to tackle the issue tracker migration, using a Python script [1] i found on Github. The script requires one to specify a Github user account that owns the repository the issues will get migrated to. I did a dry run on a fork of the main repo using my Github account, fixed up some issues in the script, and validated things to the best of my abilities. Things looked good.<p>Then i ran it on the main repository. Luckily i was watching our IRC channel. After about 4 minutes, people started to scream. They each received 789 e-mails from Github. Every single issue i migrated, and every single comment of each issue triggered an e-mail notification to all watchers of the main repository.<p>This wasnt apparent to me during the dry runs, as i used my own Github account. The script posts all issues/comments with the user account i supplied, so naturally, i did not get any notification mails.<p>I stopped the script after 130 issues (4 minutes), and immediately started sending out apologies and a mail to Github support, to which i havent received an answer yet. I send roughly 300k mails through their servers in a matter of minutes. If i hadnt watched IRC, id have send out about 4 million mails to 460 people within an hour.<p>Let me assure you that im extremely sorry about this incident. I know that things like this can interrupt daily workflows quite a bit, even if getting rid of those mails is not a Herculean task. Id be rather upset if a repo maintainer pulled something like this on me. Please accept my deepest apologies.<p>The lesson for Github API users: think hard about the implications of automating tasks through the Github API if you have more than a few watchers.<p>The lesson for Github/API designers: consider safe-guarding against such issues in your API, in case other idiots like me pull off something similar in the future.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/tgoyne/google-code-issues-migrator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tgoyne/google-code-issues-migrator</a>",1379195194

Making use of it is as likely to be a mistake as otherwise.  Consider all of the times you see people modify a list in LISP and accidentally continue to use the previous version.<p>Yeah, the focus object, to me, follows naturally with the way we do imperatives in natural language.  Though, I guess there we have prepositions and such, too.  (Are there programming languages with prepositions?  I&#x27;ve seen creative use of them in testing libraries.)<p>And, ultimately, what I want is a system where a reference essentially tracks the state of what it references?  Functions on objects, then, would be tracked not just in terms of input/output, but whether they affect the item the are operated on?  (This make sense?)<p>That is, few people would expect the following &quot;program&quot; to work:<p><pre><code>    rocket = new rocket()\n    rocket.launch()\n    rocket.addFuel(fuel)\n</code></pre>\nI have seen fancy usage of generics to have it such that launch could not be called on a Rocket<NoFuel> instance.  This makes it possible to possibly do chained calls that would work as expected, but chaining quickly gets cumbersome.  Especially if you want to do some things unrelated to the state of the rocket in there at some point.<p>Do you know of any such systems?<p>Also, apologies or not addressing the QS stuff.  Wrote all of the above and realized I didn&#x27;t touch it. :(  I simply meant that most &quot;cute&quot; QS implementations you see in functional languages (and, hence, readable) are actually not the same algorithm, since they require a ton more memory.<p>And, yes, all of this is a shared state problem.  Though, again, I think if objects had ways of indicating what functions change state and what &quot;state&quot; is required of an object, much of that confusion would go away.<p>Consider, if you have a team of cooks working, there is no confusion about when the &quot;onion&quot; that must have been diced is added to the pot.

I was fine with it being the same when I learned to type (on a typewriter) and having text-presentation software do some micro kerning on certain abbreviations doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least; automating such drudgery is one of the main reasons to use computers in the first place.<p>A third option is to dispense with the punctuation marks on abbreviations and simply refer to &#x27;Mr Jones.&#x27; This took a little getting used to, but since real grammatical consistency would involve abbreviating &#x27;Mister&#x27; as &#x27;M&#x27;r,&#x27; (a practice which you can see in some older books and which persisted with obscure words like f&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le) dropping the period seems simpler.

You don&#x27;t seem to be <i>reading</i> the claims that you are with such great confidence declaring to be wrong.<p>FWIW, the phrase &quot;all of those species&quot; in context pretty clearly referred to THIS list of species:<p>> <i>raccoons, crows, cows, pigeons, rats, mice, dogs, house cats</i>",1379192698

If every community does that where it would be profitable for a plant to be built, the plant doesn&#x27;t get built.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has renewed operating licenses and existing plants have purchased new reactors, but all of that is just about maintaining the plants that have already been around for decades.<p>The tangent was not about atheists, deists, Republicans, and Democrats.

You forget the primary function of a music production company is to act as a bank for the artist, they&#x27;ll sign a contract with anyone who is willing to re-pay a loan. The point I was making is that it&#x27;s not things like Grooveshark discouraging those practices, it&#x27;s cheap technology which has made it more cost-effective for artists to just avoid production companies all together.<p>And this is a GOOD thing. We don&#x27;t need them. Those companies filled a needed economic role before when cost-effective recording and distribution was a problem, but it&#x27;s not anymore. Keeping them around is just encouraging economic abuse, i.e. rent-seeking in the form of royalties and licensing fees.",1379192425

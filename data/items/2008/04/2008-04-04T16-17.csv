It describes the difficulty of people who have long term goals that get subsumed by short term urges.<p>We all have drives, say for example the drive to mate and the drive to eat, and these drives compete: can't mate if we don't stay thin, can't be thin if we eat those cookies. In the long term someone may want to lose weight, but the short term impulse to eat can override that goal, even if intellectually we know what we'd prefer. I suspect that human action is as much driven by our chemical drives as our intellectual choices.<p>Willpower refers to the ability to use the rational element of our psyche to repress the baser elements rather than having the baser elements override the rational.

Profitable businesses all generate return-on-capital; that cash can be reinvested to get new businesses off the ground.<p>It seems like this would be a good model for seed-funding businesses like YC to try, because they've got many more at-bats than big VCs.  It might be hard for a big VC firm to generate enough cash for this: if the average investment is $5M, they take 50% of the company, and 90% of their investments fail, then their ""hit"" needs to churn off $100M in profits to sustain the next round of startups.  But if you target hundreds of niche businesses, your investment is $20K, you take 10% of the company, and 50% of the companies survive, then they only need to spin off $400K/year in profits to fund the next round.  That seems a lot more achievable.<p>Then again, one of the reasons Berkshire is successful is that Buffett refuses to invest in businesses that don't have predictable streams of cashflow.  Startups are anything but predictable, so maybe the model's fundamentally flawed when it comes to startups.",1207327128

To clarify my point, starting a website with an advertising based revenue model is similar to starting a new newspaper or magazine. I used The Onion as an example because I remember it being freely available in bars back when I was in college.<p>I don't have any marketing data on whether advertisers prefer paying audiences or not, but I assume a lot of that would depend on the advertiser. I know that the bigger players in web media (facebook, myspace, etc) are definitely ""bottom-of-the-barrel"" when it comes to advertising rates because they reach such scattered demographics.<p>With that being said, I don't fully understand your point about advertisers preferring paying audiences. I think the problem is in the math. If I start charging for content (turning my users into a paying audience) then I'm going to most likely going to serve less page views. I don't know if the extra money advertisers are willing to spend for my now paying audience would be enough to offset the loss in page views.<p>The main example of a media website with a paying audience I can think of is the NYT, and I think the only reason they can get away with charging for content is because they've been established for so long. I think the rest of us are going to have to decide between 1) charging up front 2) trying to build a media property 3) trying to make money from premium subscriptions (which usually just amount to being donations from dedicated users).<p>Thanks for the reply, I'll definitely be thinking about this.",1207326324

Cool.<p>You say, ""it is inherently impossible to start a small self-sustaining business and to grow it"".  I, along with 7 million of my compatriots beg to disagree.  If you don't want to play roulette, er I mean pursue VC, there are a lot of other ways: bootstrapping, friends and family, angels, debt, etc., etc., etc.<p>I guess the thing that bothers me most about that remark is that someone may come here, read that, actually believe it, and then become discouraged.<p>OTOH, maybe it's just another form of Darwinism.  Anyone who pursues an ""advertising = only revenue"" strategy should be prepared for the worst.  More prospects for those of us with sound business models.",1207325466

There is absolutely no reason that the app server ever need know about these cached static page loads.</i><p>> Really cool stuff, but I can see where memory can become an issue. He's probably running into paging issues and trying this out as a fix.<p>He's also running into <i>state</i> issues, since he's keeping all session state as in-memory continuations, which is probably forcing him to keep news.yc on one box.<p>One thing that might work is to come up with a way to serialize those continuations, and store the key-value pairs in a memcached box.  Then the app server can become stateless again, and he can add more boxes.",1207325439

And this will lead to a massive market correction at some point.  Companies that had the balls to listen to reason (a la 37signals), will be the ones that weather the storm.  They'll end up being the Berkshire-Hathaway of the internet industry because they a)focus on the long-term, b) concentrate on what they know and do best, and c) fiercely execute on value, and not trends.<p>There's a reason Warren Buffet came through the dot-com crash unscathed.

He starts off saying one thing and proceeds to contradict himself. Really there are advantages and disadvantages to everything. Spending too much time learning new languages and never master CS basics is clearly a waste. However, never learning a new language, or more importantly, never programming in a fashion or environment that is unfamiliar to you, can lead to an insular way of thinking. ""If all you have is a hammer, all problems begin to look like nuts,"" or something like that. Its a matter of being a little bit selective and aggressive with your choices. If a new language is too easy, its probably not teaching you much.",1207324980

It was the sense of having something someone really wants when what they are offering isn't something you're interested in. The predatory leer also triggers some part of the ""flight"" instinct.<p>It was also enlightening in the sense that the rejection wasn't about him (he was a Sloan grad, and a nice enough guy), or his idea--it just wasn't a match. I work on unfunded startups, I'm just busy now and didn't care for his idea.<p>When I had to politely repeat how busy I am, I could suddenly see how being an attractive woman who had to fend off advances could be exhausting, and how easy it would be to stop being polite if you had to do it all the time.",1207324914

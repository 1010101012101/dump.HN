112018,comment,111398,111924,0,0,davidw,,,"I find that this has a big impact on the local demographics.  One of the reasons I was so happy to return to Padova in 2000 is that it just feels more 'real' to me.  There are rich people, poor people, and everything in between.  Lots of old people, but plenty of young people and families as well.<p>The bay area, unless you're rich, seems to be more about ""get in, make money, get out"".   We're a bit weary of moving, and would like to stay somewhere for a little while.",1202474608

If you trust them and they trust you they will be honest and you will learn. If you don't trust them leave.<p>For fun you can look at <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/</a>. Project Euler poses a series of problems for you to solve using a language of your choice. Of course you'll need to get your peers to do it as well but the different approaches to each problem can be very revealing. You can learn a lot about your abilities by reading the comments in the forums which are unlocked when you complete a task.<p>As a side note remember that the power of most programmers is unlocked within a team. Some 'lesser' programmers shine within a team and fail on their own. The reverse is true also. I know many excellent programmers that are near useless inside teams of non-programmers and a few that can't work with anyone.",1202472747

Seems like they have their hands full with their 'own' companies, and wouldn't want to dilute their brand with more unknown prospects.<p>What might be cool, on the other hand, is to have an 'open house' for those companies willing to do a more public demo, and/or simply chat with the general public curious about YC.  Would probably be good PR.",1189497329

53214,comment,52936,53081,0,0,iamyoohoo,,,"Maybe pg can answer your specific question, however,
Ideally you should work on some small projects with your co-founder before you proceed full scale. Usually you'll find out within a few weeks if the cofounder gels well with you. Sometimes (as i found out soon enough), there is a conflict of interest, some people are more dedicated than others etc. Hence, it is always better to work with someone on small projects before you start a company or even apply to YC.... that's what I think.",1189497096

53207,comment,53167,53167,0,0,chmike,,,"Looking more into the details, and for instance the videos, one see that the ""inventor"" collects water in a small pool next to his house which is full of seaweeds (it happens in Florida). <p>An obvious possible explanation is that the fuel is just methane diluted to saturation in the water. The micro wave shaking produces the same effect as when shaking a bear, champagne or  a soda. I don't know if this is the right explanation, but apparently this possibility has never been checked. Looking at the video it seem that the flame is not lasting forever. This would be normal once the methane is exhausted. <p>It is totally misleading to say that this guy is producing energy from salt. <p>",1189494616

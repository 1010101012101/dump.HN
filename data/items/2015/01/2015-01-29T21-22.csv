8969093,comment,8967685,8968730,0,0,jtbigwoo,,,">> You absolutely can brute force with management. You can always pay people more, or give up some of your equity to someone who will work harder.<p>Offering more money/equity will allow you to pick from a bigger pool of possible employees.  If you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can use that to hire better performing people.  It&#x27;s really hard to keep good people, though, because they can generally find another high-paying job when they get fed up with you.<p>I can think of three situations where a company can survive bad management:<p>-Companies that are growing ridiculously fast can keep great employees, at least as long as the growth keeps going.  If everything else is going great, employees can overlook a manager who doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing.  That means everything is great--pay and benefits, opportunities for advancement, ability to have an impact, enjoyable coworkers, great location, etc.  Happily for startups, this can give you breathing room to figure out how to be a good manager.  The growth can&#x27;t last forever, though.  When it slows, the best performers tend to leave first since they&#x27;re the most confident in their ability to find a similar position elsewhere.<p>-Companies that are the only game in town can keep great employees.  This is sort of the inverse of the last one.  If there are no other good opportunities, either because of geographic, economic, or political issues, employees will stay rather than being unemployed.  If the economy gets better or the employee decides to move, the company is out of luck.  Plus, the limited pool tends to work both ways--fewer good people look for jobs in these situations.<p>-Companies that can offer lottery-level payouts and craps-level odds.  When I was in college in the mid-90&#x27;s, Microsoft seemed to have their choice of any college grad in the western U.S.  The reason was simple: there was a pretty good chance you could work there for three years and come out a millionaire.  This obviously isn&#x27;t a model that very many companies can follow, but lot of startups will try to make similar promises.  (I&#x27;m not saying that Microsoft was poorly managed in the 90&#x27;s, it&#x27;s just an example.)<p>>> Being present longer and taking fewer breaks is superficially working harder. More abstractly, you can work harder until you make redundant people who complain about coffee breaks, if you so choose.<p>It appeared to me that they were heading off site to work out issues between founders, not because they were taking breaks.

When you say &quot;clearly is not&quot;, have you really tried to find it? or assume it is not there.  You acknowledge you have seen some data such as the toxic ingredients.  So in this case you could have a discussion around the interpretation of the data etc.<p>My point is that we shouldn&#x27;t assume the other side are always ignorant, uneducated or just following Jenny McCarthy etc.  You will find plenty of doctors, neurosurgeons etc that also have issues with vaccines.  Dr. Wakefield became famous for the autism issue; however, you should be aware that since then there are many educated doctors that find some issue with vaccines.  Of course being a doctor doesn’t make you automatically correct, it is just once again being aware that the person you are debating may have what appears to be credible information.<p>It would be best to ask where the person is coming from in a non hostile way.  Just ask, so what have you discovered and what led you to your decisions for example.  That is friendly and opens up conversation.  From then you can discern if this person made decisions based on credible sources ( but maybe not accurate ) or they have not actually educated themselves.<p>When I say credible sources, I mean to say at least they are referencing other doctors, scientists, studies vs some blog.  Credible in this instance doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean correct or wrong, but acknowledging they did their research will allow conversation to continue.  Then you can share counter research etc as conversation progresses.<p>Just be aware, within the scientific community, these topic still are being researched and it is not as if they are completely closed.  For example investigations still continue into mercury and autism.  Being aware of such is always a plus when having such discussions as you will appear to at least know something about where they are coming from.  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995277</a>",1422566187

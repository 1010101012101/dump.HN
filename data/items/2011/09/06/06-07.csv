I found an example I remembered from <i>The Big Short</i>, finance rather than tech: ""Their clothes told you a lot, too. The guys who ran money dressed as if they were going to a Yankees game. Their financial performance was supposed to be all that mattered about them, and so it caused suspicion if they dressed too well. If you saw a buy-side guy in a suit, it usually meant he was in trouble, or schedule to meet with someone who had given him money, or both. Beyond that, it was hard to tell much about a buy-side person from what he was wearing. The sell side, on the other hand, might as well have been wearing their business cards: The guy in the blazer and khakis was a broker at a second-tier firm; the guy in the three-thousand-dollar suit and the hair just so was an investment banker at J.P. Morgan or someplace like that.""",1315292377

2964473,comment,2960235,2961532,1,0,yason,,,"I've only seen books where you absorb textual descriptions of what's happening by deciphering sentences and paragraphs written in some vague form of language which leaves using your imagination to be the only way to actually make it vivid and real. But, I probably don't know everything.<p>Films are a bit different because they inevitably offer some visual scene that is much more pre-set than a book can ever offer. But there comes the art of cinematography which, like any art, is about showing pointers to what can't be seen. This approach has become more rare yet it would be very useful especially in dramatizing these action and horror films that, these days,diverge from it most.<p>It's often much more effective to <i>not</i> show what's happening than detailed takes of the action. A cliche is that the first time an alien or a fictional monster is shown on the screen, the film will falls flat because the unrealistic visual mock-up blatantly kills all chance for your imagination to do its job. Similarly a hectic fighting scene just gets lost in the action but the same could be filmed differently, showing something that all the fighting points to, instead of showing the fighting itself. With books, they say that a writer should describe what happens instead of writing his interpretation of it.",1315292315

Intel has accelerated their development program for Atom[1], but at the moment Intel doesn't have a processor that competes at the power usage of current smart phones.

TSMC is supposed to start shipping ARM on 28nm in Q4 2011[3], but historically they are usually late. TSMC is allegedly planning a 20nm fab, but it is unclear how far off that is.<p>Nokia (remember them?) was signed up to do smartphones on Atom in 2012, but then they switched to WinMo (which is ARM only).<p>I personally don't think they'll do well in smartphone, but tablets is a whole other market.<p><i>ARM,as a mobile optimized architecture, will never compete on performance grounds with IA</i><p>That's not what nVidia think[4].

They find them elegant, while everyone else who has to read them...actually thinks they are horribly overcomplicated. C++ template programming is awful, but some people love it because they love how elegant their code can become. They love that they can immerse themselves in the language features. Unfortunately this provides a net detriment to the code you are writing. No matter how good your code is, someone will have to read it again, even if it's just you. Code should be simple. I believe code should be difficult to write bad. In the common languages though it's very easy to write undecipherable code.

Written more concisely it doesn't present an immediate need for shortening or clarification by CS:<p><pre><code>  document.onkeydown = function(event) {\n      var key_to_func = {\n	  37: ""pan_left"", 38: ""pan_up"",\n	  39: ""pan_right"", 40: ""pan_down"",\n	  189: ""zoom_out"", 187: ""zoom_in""\n      };\n      for (var i in game_pieces)\n	  game_pieces[i][key_to_func[event.keyCode]]();\n      return the_screen.refresh(game_pieces);\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThe class example is better but I haven't found much use for the JavaScript prototypes to build class-like constructs. Instead of using prototyping I generally just create objects and shove stuff into them. YMMV.<p>Last example is merely a transformation of the first version. The constructs used are quite similar: it would have been nice to see CoffeeScript transform the actual paradigms used in the code. The CoffeeScript version still reads like JavaScript, just with slight syntactic sugar.<p>Mere syntactic sugar might actually be the core idea of CoffeeScript (instead of landing a somewhat higher-level language on top of JS) in which case the example illustrates nicely why the gains from switching from JS to CS are mostly cosmetic. You can compress your code conceptually much better if you just write JS more functionally, i.e. write a few quick functions to provide map/filter/reduce and some helpers.",1315290421

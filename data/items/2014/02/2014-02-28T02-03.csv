I am waiting to hear back from a &#x27;Kelly&#x27; temp agency employee (who was high as shit when he spoke with me)  for a job assembling plastic parts for $8. This might amount to less than $150 take home as I might have to take a cab home because the buses don&#x27;t run after the shift ends. I rent a room in a trailer with no door which had a leaky roof until we put a tarp over it. Additionally my mother has emphysema, works 7 days a week and I am powerless to do anything for her.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that all the geek analyzing of &#x27;structural&#x27; economic problems are partially in vain. I think human beings are inherently social animals, thus until the financial moguls, billionaires, the Mark Zuckerbergs and Larry Pages of the world literally feel that people like me have the power to kill them.... then nothing will change.This is the same carnal belief that lead to our democratic social order.  Even if you believe in things like a &#x27;living wage&#x27; , without the support from the wealthy it won&#x27;t happen. Those people like most don&#x27;t do shit unless their is something in it for them, but people like me have no leverage other than being semi suicidal and wanting to kill something.<p>Voting doesn&#x27;t work and the government doesn&#x27;t care.<p>I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too complicated.

Or if it is what you&#x27;re looking for, it turns out to be a bunch of fluff and vapor to get you to respond so that they can show you other houses that you really don&#x27;t want.<p>If you try to keep in touch with a good realtor who doesn&#x27;t have what you want now but may in the future, he just completely forgets you or what you wanted to begin with.

I will agree with you that the default scoping of variables has some real costs in terms of maintenance and debugging that are not initially apparent to too many programmers though.<p>> Sure, Moose and other modern helpers will fix that to some extent, sometimes with other tradeoffs (performance).<p>Moose has performance impacts.  If you want something less heavy, use Moo, or Role::Tiny.  These offer fewer features and better performance.  Also as I recently learned, lexically scoped variables are faster, so use strict can in fact sometimes flag possible performance improvements there.<p>> But the &quot;malleability&quot; of Perl feels silly at some point where you get a bloated, slow and lacking simulation of a type-safe language when you could use a much faster modern language with real static type checks and great maintainability (like Go) instead.<p>To be honest, the other languages I really like in this regard are red and rebol, which are, if anything, more malleable.

The findings thus demonstrates an alignment of ethics and private interests.<p>On (ii): there is potential for abuse. When an insider sells stock, the sale must be reported electronically to the SEC via Forms 3, 4, and 5. When an insider sells <i>restricted</i> stock it is reported via Form 144. Form 144, unlike Forms 3, 4, or 5, may be filed electronically <i>or by paper</i> - over 90% of Form 144s are filed by paper. These paper filings are only available through third-party data providers, e.g. Bloomberg, and even then at a delay from filing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.darden.virginia.edu/web/uploadedFiles/RajgopalSECtradingpaper.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darden.virginia.edu/web/uploadedFiles/RajgopalSEC...</a>",1393553021

Monads come from Category theory.<p>A while ago the FP people figured out that their `hacks&#x27; to do IO actually conform to the structure of a Monad.  So they exploited the fact.

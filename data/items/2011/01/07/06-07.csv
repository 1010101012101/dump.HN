One problem with hiring is that everyone must be willing to uphold the standard - if you have too many people who are never willing to be the one to say no-hire, the standard will fall - everyone has to be willing to take the responsibility for saying no.<p>That said, systemic bias is an orthogonal (and real) issue.

The idea that somehow ""he"" is better now. I emphasize ""he"" because somehow it implies his continued existence, and that is quite strange. What if ""he"" doesn't exist anymore so there is nobody to feel at peace?<p>Does that mean that I would have preferred for him to still be alive and be suffering? Would have that been a better way? I don't think so either, so I am just another confused person.<p>I guess the best scenario would have been been if he sent out what he sent out but he <i>didn't actually kill himself</i>.<p>Perhaps naively, I believe that would have helped him, it would have let others know about his problem, and others , maybe even strangers like us, discussing his actions here, could have shared our stories or tried to do something to help.",1294382433

At Disney and Amazon, it meant that the people producing consumer-facing content wasted a lot of time fighting the tools that were supposed to enable their jobs, and a lot of developers had to waste a lot of time supporting the tools that weren't doing their job.<p>For example, just two and a half years ago, one of the buyers at Amazon showed me how she set up the relationships so that when you look at an iPod, you get a collection of compatible accessories. She had to create relationships for EVERY permutation between each accessory and for each accessory to the iPod. By hand. In a spreadsheet (Excel, I think.)

I think the majority of CS graduates just don't realise it is an option.<p>In my university, the big software houses all do serious recruiting on campus. The cream of the crop are generally offered jobs before they graduate (some are also hand picked by the faculty for postgraduate research). The careers office goes out of its way to try and ensure a seamless transition between school and work. In that sort of environment, somebody wishing to work for a startup would have to consciously reject the idea of working for Google/microsoft/IBM/whatever and actively seek something else (and you won't come across most startup jobs on Monster).<p>I think it boils down to the job offerings being good enough. Microsoft, for example, offer a fancy graduate program with a lot of travelling to interesting places where they certify you in all their main technologies. That training is supposed to seem like an extension of the college life, except it pays well. And its being offered to you before you sit your finals. Just about everybody you know thinks it's a great opportunity. Why go digging for hard to find jobs in companies that might not even exist tomorrow?

It's why I am typically sad when a company outsources its support.<p>When a company does its own support with internal personnel, it has a vested interest in making the customers happy and also serving them as efficiently as possible.<p>When a company outsources its technical support, there is no real incentive for the outsource partner to let the company know how the processes and tools can be improved and automated.  In fact, quite the opposite.  If doubling the business means double the support costs, that works out great for the outsourcing partner.<p>Perhaps it's still possible to outsource the support work, but still care deeply about the details of how that work is done, and how the process can be improved/automated with systems.  I haven't seen it work that way, however.",1294381180

I believe the point about tools was not to enshrine any particular tool, but rather, to create a culture where internal tools are viewed as being the most important technical contribution.<p>This is backwards from many technology companies where internal tooling is often given a lower priority and the work assigned to less skilled engineers. This is often done with noble intent, like to try to create the best value possible for customers via improving customer facing features. But I think that proves a short term strategy rather than focusing on enabling your organization as a whole. You'd be surprised how many resources become free for feature work when your tools and infrastructure are so good that you don't wast effort on what could be automated or prevented.",1294380849

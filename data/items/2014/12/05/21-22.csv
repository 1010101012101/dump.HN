Specifically, Android devices with side-loading enabled or iOS devices that are jailbroken. Pirated versions of paid apps and games will often contain malware.

Some of the implicitness to C programmers is so familiar that they don&#x27;t notice it:<p><pre><code>  /* 1. This function returns an error code\n   *    and not a size\n   * 2. zero is success, nonzero is an error */\n  int\n  /* 3. this method belongs in mylib\n   * 4. this function supports ASCII???\n   * 5. this function allows memory to overlap? */\n  mylib_copy_first_n(\n      /*  6. *out_s is allocated\n       *  7. *out_s is greater than n bytes in size\n       *  8. out_s will hold a null terminated string */\n      char const * out_s,\n      /*  9. in_s is allocated\n       * 10. *in_s holds at least n characters\n       * 11. it&#x27;s not a big deal if in_s has null characters */\n      char const * in_s,\n      /* 10. n is not negative\n       * 11. if n is zero, something sane will happen */\n      int n);\n</code></pre>\nI wouldn&#x27;t hold up C as an example of explicitness. Now, this isn&#x27;t a great example of C code, but even in the best examples of C code, there is a lot of correctness by convention and documentation.<p>To be fair, I&#x27;m not aware of any languages and libraries that are fully explicit in type, behavior, and memory usage.

In high-end contracting work, daily rates are industry standard. If you have the option to bill on a daily increment, why would you ever bill hourly?<p>You charge a very high hourly rate today. Savvy clients are happy to pay it. Those same savvy clients would be happy to pay on the day increment if you multiplied that rate by 8. And:<p>* So would slightly-less savvy clients! Clients will balk at a high hourly rate more often than a daily rate. People are accustomed to paying for service work --- housekeeping, car maintenance --- at an hourly rate, and have price anchors in their heads that your rate <i>blows</i> past. You sound more expensive hourly.<p>* You get an automatic 8-hour commit for every project you do without even trying<p>* You can repurpose the brain cells you&#x27;re spending today on being really good at time tracking to getting really good at Jakiro in DOTA2 at no additional cost to your business<p>* You can <i>still</i> throw 3 hours per day at a client, and the next 3 hours of that same day at another client; all you have to do is be honest with yourself about how you&#x27;re doing. And again: part of the terms of a day rate is, you get to round <i>up</i>.<p>* You can <i>still</i> work more some days and less other days. Your fee structure is not your delivery date.<p>* You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to explain ramp-up and ramp-down to clients, because it&#x27;s built directly, quietly, and non-negotiably into your fee structure. It&#x27;s a conversation you simply never need to have.<p>The two points it didn&#x27;t seem like you followed from my original comment:<p>* By working with a contractor instead of hiring a full-time developer, your client is paying for projects to be completed on a specific timeline without the overhead of an employee on a deterministic schedule. There is a huge amount of convenience and de-risking implied in that. When I talk about burden-sharing, what I mean is that it is more than reasonable for part of the cost of that convenience to be &quot;you get me for a day at a time, whether you need the whole day or not&quot;. The alternative they&#x27;re looking at is &quot;you get me for 2 years at a time, whether you need me that long or not&quot;.<p>* When you have an hourly rate, any time you do anything free for a client, you risk creating the expectation that that thing should have been free, and that it&#x27;s reasonable to ask for that free thing in the future. But very few freebie tasks take a whole day. The client can intuit that a day&#x27;s worth of work is going to cost, but still feel comfortable asking for a 30 minute phone call without wondering whether it&#x27;s going to be invoiced.",1417813986

They could have solved this one with better method naming, or at least improved documentation, so people are aware of the fact. The String#charAt() Javadoc is not really useful, unless you fully understand the implications of: &quot;If the char value specified by the index is a surrogate, the surrogate value is returned.&quot;\nAlso, if you are handling CJK strings, is there actually a <i>need</i> to split them by charAt()? The runtime could just tag such strings and use the fastest indexing method, falling back to the slow one for those.<p>Concatenation: true, and that the jit can&#x27;t optimize most loops by using StringBuilder is a little embarrassing. Abstractions are always leaky, but this one I think could be improved, so that more cases would be made faster by the runtime.<p>Of course language designers aren&#x27;t usually stupid, but its not like they all were created in some cozy Languages Workshop, where they could take their time to ripen, being guarded over by benevolent gardeners. See PHP, see Javascript, and of course Java, too. We don&#x27;t have to accept accidental complexity as a given, there are useful abstractions, and we should use them.\nRust and C# are better than previous attempts, imho, because they got proper funding and are designed by people who know what they&#x27;re doing. And the whole field of software is better for it!<p>If you are Google, you are in the unique position of having top talent and huge amounts of servers. In that case, the trade-off to use C++ is probably the right one. People can handle its complexity, and it pays off due to increased performance, because the code runs on a million servers. But this simply isn&#x27;t true for 99% of the business, and using C or C++ is not the optimal choice for them.",1417813762

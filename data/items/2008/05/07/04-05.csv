Just add song lyrics aimed at your ex-girlfriend and you have AOL circa 2002 in a ""social network"" of high school kids. The only reason I would want to use it is for mass texting, i.e. Want to meet for lunch? type messages. For that a better feature would be grouping on your cell phone.",1210134841

Only people like Paul Graham can put on stuff like Startup School for free.<p>This was organized by a group of Seattle Hackers who are just trying to do a good thing.  No ulterior motive. No goal of profit.  No hustle for sponsors.  I know the people putting it on-- they are decent chaps...  And I know a couple of the speakers (in fact, I might be on a panel).<p>WTF is the point of attacking the event?",1210134781

Something that conventional programming constantly misses.  Something remarkably simple, consistent and powerful.  It's where code is data along a continuous path of transformations.",1210134342
183155,comment,182676,182806,0,0,maximilian,,,"matlab costs boatloads of money for commercial stuff.  At least from my perspective.<p>I wish there were an open alternative to matlab that was fast.  Matlab is kinda fast if you do exactly the right thing, but its interpretedness gets in the way.  Most of the people I know doing computational stuff write everything in c using some outside libraries to speed things up.  Often they just code up all their own algorithms from scratch.  Its lame, but they usually halve the computation time.  I could imagine that SciPy and NumPy is much much faster than Matlab.<p>Matlab is crazy easy to code for though.  Its really handy for prototyping.",1210134002

You could probably live off that for a whole year, working full time on your idea(s).<p>I've also got a few ideas, ranging from simple to grandiose.  My plan is to start with the simplest (fastest to create, simplest revenue model, smallest potential) as a moonlighting effort.  I hope that it can generate enough to keep me alive to buy time to start pursuing the grandiose ideas.  YMMV.",1210133871

2399876,comment,2398238,2398238,1,0,huuleon,,,"Yes I totally agree why craigslist dominates the industry because of simplicity and ease of use for users.  Craigslist has always been the place where i go first to look for used products especially cars.  But there are two things i dislike about craigslist.  One is sometimes you'll receive fishing emails asking you to reset password where you later noticed your computer is contain with viruses.  Second, buying stuff on craigslist can be very time consuming especially with cars.  You'll definitely have to travel multi times to different sellers before finding your ideal item.  Plus the photos on craigslist are so low quality, you barely can see any scratches or damages.  One time i had to  traveled 2 hours to check out a car posted on craigslist then realized the seller lied to me which wasted 4 hrs of my time driving back and forth.  So i started a website to help people buy and sell used stuff via videos instead of photos.  I believe video is the best way to showcase something second hand online.  It can save people so much time traveling to many places when they can instead watch it online without leaving the comfort of their homes.  Although there are some disadvantages of using video to advertise your products but it can go a long way in the future as technologies increasingly advance.  What do you think about the video concept?  Can video replace photos for second hand market sometime in the near future?<p>Leon-\n<a href=""http://www.123exchanges.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.123exchanges.com</a>",1301751650

2399867,story,,,2,10,18pfsmt,"NFC Data Dump: Part I",,"NFC technology and concepts sprang from RFID (a family of technology itself, operating across 4 very different frequencies) technology. RFID emerged originally as a replacement for barcodes in the supply chain. The metrics of focus within the supply chain  were on read range and tag_reads/ second. NFC operates at 13.56MHz.  In RFID, you had the reader that was powered, and the tag which was a powerless inductor with a EEPROM chip attached. The reader is the transceiver, the tag is a transponder. NFC turned this paradigm on its head-> the transceiver/ transponder were one. In ISO RFID standards, you had ISO 15693 and ISO 18000-3 that focused on the supply chain; and, ISO 14443A and 14443B which focused on security/ data rate ->payment->passport. Sony purposed a 14443C standard for the FeliCa chip, but that failed. NFC technology only works within a range of 4 inches (10cm) by standard, but 2 inches in reality.<p>I've got a ton more knowledge about NFC, but I don't want to spam HN if there is no interest.

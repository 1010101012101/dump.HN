For the average person, their biggest expense is their home. If you have less stuff and can comfortably live in a smaller place, there is a lot of saving there.<p>Also, there is the lifetime cost issue. One good screwdriver may be expensive, but probably compares well with 10 crappy screwdrives that wear down or break that you buy over many years.<p>I think the interesting part of the OP was the point that digitisation does enable a new kind of minimalism - one that does not require as much compromise as it did before.

I think the above statement is not true. Some of the schools are regionally accredited (the one I went to was). Meaning credits will transfer and other schools will honor the degree when a student seeks a higher degree.<p>I cant speak for the curriculum taught at all of the schools but I can say that for UOP the curriculum was at a level somewhere between a 4 year community collage and an average state school. I knew the deal going in, an I knew the expense but I was already an executive at the time and needed a degree to move to the CTO spot in the company I was with. It was a no brainier for me. 50k for school was cheap for me so long as school did not interfere with my already overloaded schedule. What sealed the deal for me was the 1 class at a time approach. Instead of 16 week semesters where you take 3-4 classes UOP broke it into 1 focused class over a 5 week period. Given my schedule this allowed me to bank the credits and adjust my schedule. I only needed to plan 5 weeks at a time. And with as busy as I was that was the most I could do. If the next 5 weeks where going to be slammed. I could sign up for the next class when my schedule cooled off.<p>To say that they are of no value is characteristically unfair, to say that they don't offer a good value proposition to most people is more accurate.<p>I think the idea of degrees as a job requirement are nonsensical in the first place. If the job falls in a scientific discipline there are already certification (Doctor, Nurse, engineer) that prove (as much as you can) core competency. Legal the same thing (Real Estate, Lawyer, CPA). As well, for the arts it does not matter just because you are study in the arts does not make you good at them.<p>If people would stop the nonsensical notion that a degree creates a more qualified candidate, we would not have people saddling themselves with debt just to be competitive and the universities would go back to being institutions of repute, where great minds go to collaborate. The rest of us are just getting in their way to make ourselves feel better about ourselves.",1286476057

The people there, like most everywhere else in the U.S., vote in lock step with their ""traditional"" parties, for/against issues than don't relate to them on a daily basis.<p>People will happily vote against their own self-interest because they're under-informed, and held emotionally captive by politicians who invoke moral and religious argument to further their agenda.<p>Did these people choose to have a dysfunctional fire department? No. They chose less taxes, and smaller government. The GOP, instead of thinking of what's best for the people, decided to stick by their philosophical guns and deprived people of functioning infrastructure.<p>I will grant you that specific house was outside their taxed jurisdiction.

Why hasn't the state of Tennessee dictated a policy of full, state-wide coverage for fire and rescue services for people in remote areas?

It's certainly not a satisfying answer to your claim that we can have anarchism and still hold onto computers and the internet.<p><i>The actual problem with it is that it's on small scales. The largest examples probably being Spain and part of Russia during their revolution. In the case of Spain literally everyone joined together to stop the Anarchists. We don't have large scale empirical knowledge because people in positions of power don't want us to.<p>For me this is the strongest argument that there is something to the idea. If it were a fatally flawed idea the smart thing to do would be to let some high profile country try it and watch them fail.

As it stands, setting up an anarchic society--especially in the middle of a revolution or civil war--just means there's <i>tons</i> of competing factions, each of which is better served by taking the anarchic territory for itself rather than letting it fall to a rival. At least unless the anarchic territory is more difficult to conquer than it is worth.<p><i>Lastly, the bases of the idea is a moral one. Why does anyone have the right to be over anyone else. Given the levels of corruption in government around the world, this strikes me as a valid question.</i><p>I used to have moral problems with this too, but ultimately it doesn't matter--I'd rather limit myself to making small changes on the real world we have to generate better results.",1286475183

They let Google see the answer, so that it will be indexed and then put up a DRM wall for regular users.<p>I got bit by this by scribd the other day, I went to download a pdf, and they said I had to log in with Facebook (I don't have an account but my wife does) I was reluctant but I did, then after they got my wife's Facebook acceptance they told me that the document was in the archive and that I would have to upload a document to get 24hr access to the archive. I think they could have told me there was another hoop before they got my (my wifes) info. I was pissed and uploaded a profanity riddled document explaining my thoughts on scribd practices.<p>Anyway, I am rambling my point is actions like scribd's make me very hesitant to sign up with these information baiters like experts-exchange because there is always one more hoop to jump through.",1286474606

I tend to reach out to 50+ servers at a time, and iterating though that on any tasks that take over a min is mind numbing.<p>Well through this post perhaps the branch will be better known, but I haven't really posted much about it in that I though it'd be done sooner. Then any mention of a branch would be negated by it's inclusion in master.",1286474559

I agree that startups don't do that.  The result is insecure code.  If Diaspora gains a reputation for bad security, people won't trust them.<p>3. Well, I'm a tools guy.  Burp Suite looks great too, I didn't know about it, but it's just naive to say ""that's the only tool you need"".<p>4. I agree that Diaspora's made the right tradeoff so far in getting a minimum viable product out -- I had discussed that in my previous post.  The question is, what next?<p>5. Everything they've written so far.<p>6. Setting up a page for security contacts is certainly a good first step.",1286474521

Hollywood movies frequently gather more monies than supposedly more highly sophisticated and artful ones. So what? Zynga isn't the first (and isn't the last) to make money off mindless simplicity of the populus.<p>(just don't get me wrong - i like Hollywood, especially ""governator"", and it isn't Bach that is in my earphones - pop-culture has it for each of us, i'm just too old for Facebook/Farmville)",1286474471

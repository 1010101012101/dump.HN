Or, placeholder pages for any sort of organization.<p>eventually, it'll grow into a full site builder and a mailing list and a way to charge people for events/merchandise. more here: <a href=""http://blog.groupped.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.groupped.com/</a><p>I'm just going really slow trying to balance the consulting gig and this and a few other ideas at the same time.

658486,comment,658402,658402,0,0,rufo,,,"(EDITOR'S NOTE: Oops. This turned into more of a treatise than I'd realized. I hope this is useful stuff, and not too nit-picky. I also see I'm the only one so far mentioning these things, and I'm interested anyway, so maybe I'm just being cranky. :-)<p>Your video is great, and the site design itself is quite nice, but the content itself may need to be fleshed out and reworked a bit - I'm generally not a huge screencast watcher, and if I didn't have an interest in the product I might've clicked past almost immediately.<p>For an example, I didn't realize that the screenshots were clickable at first glance. When I clicked on them I get a screenshot that's too large and zoomed out. Add some indicator that they're clickable, crop it down to what's really important (no window dressing) and make sure it'll fit on a window that's reasonably sized.<p>I'd also consider some sort of in-line image display technique or gallery, so you can illustrate exactly what you want the potential customer to see and take away from the screen - when I click on the screenshot, the text explaining what I'm looking at goes away.<p>Even the details themselves don't seem quite fleshed out enough. What data is being reported? In order to find that out, I have to go to the pricing page, then look at a footnote in difficult-to-read text at the bottom of the page. (In fact, get rid of the footnotes entirely. They make you look like you have something to hide - but nothing in the footnotes looks particularly bad.) Don't make me think - I might only give your page a few seconds to convince me, so tell me why your process snapshots are cool and useful if I'm trying to diagnose a problem (you do a better job of that in the video). Graphs, while handy, are boring on their own - tell me what data is being graphed, why your graphs are better, and why they'll help me keep my servers online.<p>To borrow from Kathy Sierra, your goal is to make me understand how and why your product is going to help me kick ass - in your case, why your product will help me keep my servers running smoothly and my clients happy. A few bullet points (while really good to have! seriously, after I decide your product is intriguing, the next thing I'll want to know is what it does) isn't quite enough on its own to make me understand why I want your product.<p>This all might be a moot point, however, since I already like the idea of the product itself, and that was after the lack of details basically forced me to watch your well-put-together video... so maybe it's working better than I thought. :-)",1245078320

Ideally, that government would be a neutral judge who simply enforces common law, and not a meddlesome theocrat who tells me how to live.  But what selection process is most likely to result in arbiter that pleases you?  Selection by Hacker News, or selection by Digg?",1245078246

Is it a standalone job board, or do the listings automatically appear on the the actual reddit site?<p>b) Starting price is fairly high. If the thing will automatically appear on reddit, then it might be justified somewhat, but even then, its pretty easy to get frontpage on programming reddit. If the thing doesn't appear on reddit, then the prices are just plain insane, why would I pay $300 or even $175 for something that gets no traffic.<p>c) If I like the job, why would I upvote it so that I get more competition?",1245078214

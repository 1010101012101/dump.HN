849209,comment,848906,848906,0,0,yannis,,,"From my own experience if you understand the cascade principle and specificity well you can get away with very compact and well written CSS files. Multi-classing is another area where developers are only now leverage to its maximum, for example if you have a look at the way the jQueryUI CSS works, by for example specifying the items you wish at the end of the file as additional classes you can introduce quite a bit of additional functionality in a much simpler way than calling functions.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    .box{define only properties that you 
           do not want to 
           change from box to box
         }

    .boxColors{background:#fff;
                color: #f60}

    .arial13{font-family:arial;font-size:13px

    <div class=""box boxColors arial13""></div>

</code></pre>
This way your classes can be used as 'functions'. As a rule, define typography and colors and opacity this way and you can keep it simple.<p>CSS was developed as an abstraction to HTML. Any abstraction to the CSS other than adding pre-processors would create serious integration problems with the DOM model and JavaScript. (See a good discussion of this at <a href=""http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/#ch-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/#ch-problems</a> by

There are endless improvements that could be made. As a side effect you are likely to get more interesting discussions precisely because you go for the more ""unusual"" stories.",1254171505

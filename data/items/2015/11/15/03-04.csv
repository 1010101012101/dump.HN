I was actually annoyed about the amount of time he spent on the whole notion of genetically engineering smarter humans. I think his intent was to rigorously prove that even if technology for some reason halted and all progress in machine learning ended along with moore&#x27;s law we&#x27;d still reach super intelligence. From that standpoint I get it as a philosopher to create a bulletproof argument. But I think it&#x27;s very unlikely that it will happen that way. It&#x27;s already far more practical to teach Watson to read better than genetically engineer a new Einstein. Also I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an iq 200 set of genes, there&#x27;s probably trade offs that would prevent this a brain has a given number of neurons and they operate at a slow speed so this is like trying to breed a better horse when cars are obviously on the horizon and will be followed by jets.",1447559939

There just aren&#x27;t that many such implementations nowadays and they&#x27;re generally done by people who know what they&#x27;re doing.  But applying Postel&#x27;s law to something like programming language implementations, where the &quot;implementors&quot; who would need to obey the first part are all the people writing programs in the language, pretty much guarantees violations of that first part.  For any given programming language anyone cares about in practice, the number of people who know the spec for it well enough to only write code that conforms to that spec, even on their first try, is _tiny_ compared to the number of people writing programs in the language.<p>At that point your only option is to accept that the first part is going to be violated, and badly.

The conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is intelligence is pretty much fixed, current psychopharmaceuticals are of very, very, very limited usefulness, and most of the differences in intelligence we see between people are caused by genetic factors not education or rearing. This was immensely disappointing for me - I&#x27;d literally give everything I own to be moved up a few standard deviations, but it does seem to be the case. I&#x27;ll be the first in line for any effective enhancement, but we do not have them now. The most likely approaches for increasing the intelligence of humans are things like embryo selection and genetic engineering of embryos - biotechnology can only do so much after your brain is done growing.<p>Iterated embryo selection looks like it will lead to humans smarter than any human who has ever lived - perhaps they will be clever enough to figure out how to upgrade an old fogey like me.

10568384,comment,10567873,10568217,0,0,aikah,,,"> I loathe the day where such apps isolate people from thought they do not like on a wholesale business. Can you imagine a world of safe spaces and such where you never have to be challenged?<p>The expression &quot;safe place&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it means. I think it has more to do with imposing the absence of debate on others than one isolating oneself from challenging views. The latter is perfectly acceptable, not the former.<p>People pushing for &quot;safe places&quot; actually want the rest of us to stop debating , having &quot;problematic&quot;, potentially &quot;offensive&quot; views, i.e. any view they don&#x27;t agree with. They don&#x27;t want a separate physical &quot;safe space&quot;, they want the concept of &quot;safe places&quot; everywhere. So it is not about isolation but rather suppressing debate in any free,open or public place.<p>You know when one hears &quot;safe place&quot; one thinks &quot;good, off course people want to feel safe&quot; , but it&#x27;s not really about physical safety or even respect, but rather a mental prison where any dissident opinion, even expressed respectfully, is banned because it doesn&#x27;t fit one specific narrative.<p>I&#x27;m sure that expression was chosen on purpose, it&#x27;s so misleading and I felt into that trap too , at first.",1447558668

10568382,comment,10567016,10567016,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"I recently watched Guy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Growing a Language&quot; talk. It&#x27;s very much related to jmoiron&#x27;s post here, and is worth a watch despite its age:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a><p>Steele&#x27;s commentary on &quot;Worse is Better&quot; seems to me to be a better representation of the original essay than the one expressed here about Go. Steele says:<p>&quot;The gist of [&#x27;Worse is Better&#x27;] is that the best way to get a language used by many persons is not to design and build &#x27;The Right Thing,&#x27; because that will take too long. In a race, a small language with warts will beat a well designed language because users will not wait for the right thing; they will use the language that is quick and cheap, and put up with the warts. Once a small language fills a niche, it is hard to take its place.&quot;<p>In other words, the lesson of &#x27;Worse is Better&#x27; is that getting a &#x27;good enough&#x27; thing to market, and benefiting from the network effects of its widespread use, will always beat getting the &#x27;the really good&#x27; thing to market in the same category, because the cost of delay is the loss of (community) network effects. The illustrative example here is UNIX and C, but it can be easily cross-applied to more recent projects.<p>From that vantage point, Go isn&#x27;t a good example of &#x27;Worse is Better&#x27;. It occupies the same niche as C, but was delivered nearly 4 decades later. It seems to be a &quot;second edition of C&quot; designed with very explicit goals of correcting specific deficiencies of C as a systems programming language, but without the scope creep that characterizes many &quot;second systems&quot;.<p>Other languages -- like Python and Scala -- occupy completely different niches and have already achieved similar scale of network effects.<p>The rest of Guy Steele&#x27;s talk is worth watching, because his high-level point is that the languages that win aren&#x27;t the simpler ones, or the ones with the simplest/best design, but instead are the &quot;growable&quot; ones that get to market.<p>For example, from Steele&#x27;s vantage point, the success of a programming ecosystem like Python&#x27;s would be evaluated as follows: it isn&#x27;t that it has the right level of simplicity/dynamism, or an appropriate programming paradigm. That Python made good decisions there helps, but they aren&#x27;t the key ingredients. Instead, its success is that it shipped in 1991, evolved over time to keep up with programming trends, that it has an awesome &#x27;import&#x27; statement, and that programmers feel they can &#x27;grow&#x27; the language through libraries (e.g. Django for web development, Pandas for data analysis) without waiting on the slow core language or stdlib evolutionary process.",1447558459

Maybe not for the right kind of risk though.""<p>There was a recent study (also posted here somewhere) showing this ""greater fool theory"" is pretty much hard-wired into human nature.",1230382657

I can't think of very many people who I'd expect to be able to answer.  I can't, not really--I can tell you what I'm studying, but I don't think studying quite counts, at least not with something else accompanying it.",1230382271

410997,comment,410687,410878,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"IMHO the UK has already succeeded in taking the first major step to an Orwellian state. The populous look to the UK government for protection from _all_ evils. It fails to understand that sometimes bad things happen to innocent people and it is prepared to give away it's freedoms so it can live in a safe warm jail.<p>I'm no anarchist, I've voted in all elections I have been eligible to vote on. The sad fact is that the last bastion of common sense in the UK is the unelected upper chamber of landed aristocracy and rich business men. You don't know how much it pains me to say that :(<p>To get back on topic. How exactly am I going to get a certificate for a website, how much is it going to cost me? I run a website for heavy metal fans (newmetalarmy.com) and I've already had complaints about the stylized zombie in the logo so I guess I'll be an 18 site then! It's just another hurdle for fringe genres. There is no money to be made in heavy metal, people do it for the art form. But 'society' considers it harmful so it squashes it.",1230382009

The cool part is that unless people make an effort themselves, their ""problems"" are not likely to influence development.<p>By the way: This is not a joke. Think a bit about it and you will see that it <i>is</i> a possible alternative.",1230381065

410990,comment,410930,410989,0,0,gaius,,,"That is true of most adults (of both sexes) however most people (here in the UK at least) choose the general direction of their careers at the age of 14, which is when you choose your GCSEs. You get to tweak it again at 16 when you choose your A-levels (from a subset of your GCSEs) and again at 18 when you choose your first degree, but the decisions made at 14 are so far upstream at this point that you only have so much maneuverability left.<p>Anyway, at 14, I remember that my double-science class was almost entirely male, perhaps 5/25 girls (about 100 people in my year in total). Drama and English had the opposite ratio. Only those 5 girls would even have had the <i>option</i> to take a science or engineering degree, 10% of the females in the year. Now we all know you don't need one of those to work in IT, but still, if you want girls in the field, that's where you've got to catch them.",1230379982

In fact, I find most women try to pursue things they enjoy, more so than avoid things they may hate (like losers, or long division, per se).<p>If there's a lack of women in IT, it's probably because they don't enjoy it, or aren't encouraged to pursue it. Most women don't make professional decisions hoping to increase their chances of havin' a cutie in the next cubicle.",1230379546

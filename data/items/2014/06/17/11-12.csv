And if nothing like this has any chance of occurring, just finding out who is in contact with real terrorists and who isn&#x27;t seems useful, whether they&#x27;re Muslim terrorists or Breivik. It is of course vitally important that information gathered for this purpose cannot be used for commercial or political ends, which is the hard part (maybe impossible).",1403006366

From my middle class home town, most people I was familiar with from elementary school seem to be working at restaurants and the like. I could have definitely used a mentor to help me see the possibilities that my parents weren&#x27;t familiar with. Now that I&#x27;m finally developing the self-awareness necessary to really go somewhere (hopefully) I&#x27;ve tried to think on how to help kids realize their potential, but in such a way as to be scalable. While maybe apps could help with self-esteem, it&#x27;s probably not possible at this point to replace the knowledge and experience of a good mentor with a standalone information system.<p>I know the frustration I&#x27;ve experienced, so I can only imagine what it&#x27;s got to be like coming from less- props to you for making it.",1403006356

7903847,comment,7902219,7902937,1,0,VLM,,,"Unfortunately &quot;decent&quot; is vague with dacs and adcs because there&#x27;s at least 3 figures of merit usually you only get to max out 1 at a time.  Assuming your app needs to max out any of them.  So if you want 24 bit input with a low noise floor good luck getting above &quot;KHz&quot; sampling ranges yet if you want 500 megasamples/sec you&#x27;re looking at like 8 bits.  Or if you want on board signal processing (differential inputs, maybe a built in multiplier, or 8 input mux on the input so you can read 8 things) you&#x27;ll &quot;pay&quot; for that one way or another.<p>The good news is this board has a pmod connector and go to digilent and search for pmods and there&#x27;s some great COTS plug and play A/D and D/A.  The bad news is there&#x27;s... one pmod connector.  That really sucks as the amount of fun you can have scales with about the cube or so of the number of peripheral devices connected.  If only this &quot;stick&quot; had two pmod connectors.  My go-to screwing around board is a mere $90 basys2 and its got 4 pmod connectors and a ton of onboard stuff.  So I&#x27;m paying an extra $65 to basically not have a headache and have a ton of fun.  I can deal with that.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to not go plug and play just get one of the breadboard to pmod adapter thingies and the RCA breakout and stick like two 8-pin DIP chips on, a D/A and a A/D and call it good.<p>You have to decide if you&#x27;re trying to minimize spend, or minimize effort (plug and play) and WRT effort are you more into hardware or software.<p>One advantage not discussed about onboard peripherals is they work and are easily tested.  There&#x27;s always a certain distrust, did I blow that chip, can that GD thing actually successfully do I2C at all, etc.  Well, if you&#x27;ve got a lot of onboard stuff, just load up the demo / test program if you&#x27;re feeling worried...  Also much as software programmers do a lot with extra added &quot;print&quot; statements for debugging, you&#x27;d be surprised what a FPGA dev can do with a bunch of onboard switches and LEDs.",1403006058

The democracy that you harp on about above as the justification for your position is <i>fundamentally incompatible</i> with pervasive surveillance and secret trials.<p>The problem is not whether they can see pictures of my cats on twitter or imessages to my girlfriend, it&#x27;s that with pervasive and universal surveillance of our communications which GCHQ is engaged in (collect it all, mastering the internet), those in power would become almost omniscient and able to manipulate our markets, our economy, our politicians, our judges and every other branch of our society. This activity is currently not significantly limited by law, but only by technical ability, which is fast changing. For example all SMS messages in the UK are stored, and all internet traffic crossing the kingdom (which is almost all of it) for as long as possible (Tempora), probably some phone calls too. We also don&#x27;t even know who they share it with - probably the NSA given their subsidiary relationship. In the wrong hands, this would be a terrible weapon, and even in the right hands, it&#x27;s likely to pervert those given the power.<p>If you had access to the private emails of judges, lawyers, accountants, politicians, in retrospect and forever it would be incredibly easy to make and break careers and manipulate everyone else in the country to bend them to your will. Now imagine this power in the hands of a select few, and the rise to power of someone ruthless enough to use it for their own ends. Perhaps initially they&#x27;d simply nudge a referendum on independence, or a presidential election by releasing inconvenient emails at the right moment, maybe they&#x27;d ensure their continued funding with blackmail (has this already happened, would we ever know?), maybe they&#x27;ll decide they could run this place better after all - again, we wouldn&#x27;t even know our democracy had been entirely subverted until it was too late.<p>IMO the time to oppose this sort of surveillance is now - surveillance should be one-off and controlled by independent judges on a case by case basis, not pervasive and eternal.",1403005582

Usually, Wittgenstein is treated as two authors, numbered Wittgenstein I (the author of the tractatus logico-philosophicus) and Wittgenstein II (the author of the Investigations and beyond). Now, the position of rather teaching, was Wittgenstein&#x27;s position after he thought of having ruled out any questions that would matter to be answered by philosophy (in the tractatus). The Investigations are quite opposed to the project of the tractatus, starting to investigate the production of meaning by language as a social process, dismissing most of the notions of the tractatus. (In other words: While the tractatus was using meaning for asking, if any traces of &quot;the mystic&quot;, the spiritual meaning of the world, were to be derived by logic – short answer: No –, the Investigations have an all together other topic, how meaning itself would be derived, contesting the very basis of the tractatus.)<p>And on metaphysics in general: We have learned so much more from Kant than, say, Da Vinci; what would Unger have to say on engineering?

7903685,comment,7903061,7903061,24,0,nl,,,"Oh wow. Minecraft. I have an 8yo boy, so I spend a lot more time thinking about this than I would like.<p>I think Mojang has it&#x27;s priorities slightly wrong here. At the moment much of the interesting stuff in Minecraft is done via mods. But the user experience for that is pretty close to pre-Google search: browse through random forums to find links to dodgy download sites that attempt to push malware or porn to you.<p>Then when you find a working download, you have to install. Inevitably that means clashes with existing mods, and hours trying different versions of things that some random person on a forum claims work.<p>FFS, I&#x27;m a Java programmer, and I can&#x27;t work out how to make this shit work most of the time.<p>In my view Mojang should do the following:<p><pre><code>  Build a working, stable official Mod API, which at least attempts to make it possible to determine if different mods will work together\n\n  Implement an in-game app store, and let mod authors sell their mods. \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d much prefer to spend a dollar on a new mod rather than the horrible, horrible experience it is now.<p>Rant over..",1403002988

Public opinion is shaped to a pretty large degree by what the media tells people to be interested in.<p>And with the media mostly telling us that it&#x27;s happening but that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not important, it&#x27;s for our own good and that anyone publishing details about it (like the Guardian) is threatening national security, that&#x27;s what a lot of people accept as fact.<p>It makes me angry because this is the exact reason why freedom of the press needs to exist - not to allow papers to publish details of some celeb&#x27;s romantic life. But it&#x27;s only the latter that 95% of the press in the UK seem to be prepared to battle to defend.",1403002893

This opens up a bunch of interesting possibilities for applications that are cpu-bound once you&#x27;re on SSD, but for which the delta between SSD-backed EBS and ephemeral storage doesn&#x27;t change the bottleneck.<p>In particular, in that sort of scenario, you might be able to mix-and-match and get a compute-optimized instance with loads of cpu power and a healthy amount of sufficiently performant storage on EBS.",1403002886

Unfortunately, lending money or items to a friend is very <i>dangerous</i> if that friend is precious.<p>When it comes to money, I&#x27;d say generally speaking: <i>lend as much as you can afford to lose</i>. Like short-term, high-risk investments: It is a high-risk investment, you could loose a friend.

669923,comment,669603,669906,0,0,stjohn,,,"I've had the same problem.  To solve it, I bought a 24-hour timer switch like this one: <a href=""http://www.cnaweb.com/productimages/215030.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnaweb.com/productimages/215030.jpg</a>, and plugged it in near my bed.  To that I hooked up a cheap garden water pump.  Next, I cut out the back of a cardboard box and taped it over the timer with lots and lots of duct tape.  The box has a lid so that I can adjust everything as needed.<p>Now, when I need to wake up at a certain time, I set the timer accordingly, lock the cardboard box lid shut with a padlock, and place the key somewhere outside.<p>In the morning, the water wakes me up and I can't go back to sleep without turning it off.  To do that I need to get up and go outside to get the key, and by the time I've returned, I'm awake enough to make a rational decision to stay awake.",1245736495

669918,comment,668953,669309,0,0,thwarted,,,"I don't know if it's so much intuition as it is luck (or, heh, being unlucky).  I seem to have an uncanny knack for spotchecking one thing, and <i>while I'm doing that</i>, uncovering a bunch of other problems because something in the things I've chosen to spot check has an association with something that looks wrong.  Like, I'll spot check a database update, and I'll display all columns even though I am only looking at one or two.  It just so happens that in the rows I chose to check, another field is obviously not being validated right.<p>I've also experienced some weird premonitions, like I'll suggest a change be made, based on some trend I may be seeing but can't articulate, and then a few days later the very thing I suggest should be changed <i>needs</i> to be changed, usually under time pressure.<p>I wish I could bottle and sell this, but I'm sure it's closer to being unlucky than having a superpower (like Rob McKenna from HHGTTG), and no one would want it.",1245735954

The human brain pays vastly more attention to the people around you than the people who support you, and if the two sets are sufficiently distinct, very strange and unhelpful attitudes arise.",1245735556

669912,comment,668973,669037,0,0,Confusion,,,"Nobody goes around upvoting every civil comment that feeds the conversation constructively: there are too many of those and they are various in quality. Nobody goes around downvoting every comment he disagrees with: there are also too many of those. Agreement/disagreement and civil/uncivil aren't the only scales involved and thinking about it in that way leads to simplistic judgments.<p>I upvote comments that <i>I</i> find valuable. That may mean I learned something from the comment, but it may also mean that I think <i>others</i> may learn something from it. If someone makes a point that I would have made otherwise: upvote. In some sense that means I 'agree' with the comment, but if someone simply relates facts, than the upvote means 'this is relevant information'. In a non-factual case it may mean 'this is an opinion/argument that people should take note of'.<p><i>Tying votes with agreement leads to groupthink</i><p>Untying votes from agreement leads to no votes at all. When you upvote a comment, you by definition 'agree' that it was a proper comment. Without agreement on the 'rightness' of comments, there is no reason to upvote any comment at all.<p>I don't understand this fear of 'groupthink'. It is perfectly clear what comments will get you a lot of karma. The fact that we don't make those comments isn't because they aren't upvoted: it's because we aren't interested in karma.",1245735185

Google is a set of disconnected services that you can take or leave. You don't like google search or gmail or google maps or google news? Go ahead and use something else. For any service that doesn't require immediate personalization, you don't even need to sign up ever. Even if every single person you interact with uses google search or gmail, it doesn't matter because you have no obligation to use it. As a developer, if you hate google and don't want to use anything by the company all you have to think about is SEO, most of which is basically common sense and regular marketing on non-google sites. Why would you possibly even need to consider ""fight[ing] against"" google unless you were directly competing?<p>In contrast, Facebook explicitly wants to be THE monolithic dominating force on the internet. You can't even use it without signing up and joining the whole Facebook thing. If everyone you know is using it, you end up missing out; it's basically vendor lock-in for your entire social life. And as a developer, interacting with Facebook in any meaningful way means dealing with Facebook every step of the way.<p>Monolithic platforms like Facebook are truly awful. Facebook is defined by locking people into the platform while Google joins together disparate web services and competes on quality and brand recognition. Google has its problems, but Facebook's problems are right at the core of everything it does.",1245733880
669896,comment,669709,669709,0,0,spaghetti,,,"Taking a break from something you're pursuing is extremely rewarding.  I first noticed this when I injured myself and couldn't run for 2-3 weeks.  When I starting running again I was a whole new person.  The time off was a great opportunity for personal growth.  I noticed this pattern again later in life when I quit my job as a programmer without any solid plans or much money in the bank.  Now I'm back and feel better than ever.  I sincerely encourage anyone who loves programming but feels burnt out to _choose_ to take a break.  If taking a break seems difficult focus all your energy on making it happen.",1245733804

669894,comment,668723,668723,0,0,cduan,,,"The analogy I prefer is that Unicode-encoding is like network protocol layers. In a (very simplified) network, the goal is to present an interface of a pipeline for sending a continuous stream of bytes. To achieve this, you have a protocol like TCP, which consists of routines for transforming a series of packets running through a wire into a stream of bytes. To achieve a series of packets running through a wire, you have a protocol like Ethernet, which consists of routines for transforming electrical pulses into a series of data packets. You need both Ethernet and TCP to turn electrical pulses into a stream of continuous bytes.<p>Similarly, the goal of Unicode is to present an interface of a stream of abstract characters (the letter ""A"", the number 3, the nonbreaking space, etc.). To achieve this, you use Unicode, which consists of routines to convert a stream of arbitrarily-long numbers (packets) into abstract characters. To achieve a stream of arbitrarily-long numbers, you use an encoding such as UTF-8, which consists of routines to convert a series of bytes into a stream of arbitrarily-long numbers. Now, using an encoding and Unicode, you can convert a stream of bytes (i.e., an arbitrary file) into a series of abstract characters.",1245733706

But right there, at the reactors, they are still very much in the several mrem/hr regime. Someone could probably calculate this. I don't think the ""speed value"" from the EV system is going to be of much use for this calculation, though the ""aperture value"" will. Nor does the color of the pixel tell you anything other than the color of the pixel that was hit by a gamma ray.<p>Never the less, a simple count could give you a pretty good first order estimate. Assume the radiation here is around 10 mrem/hr on 15 March (there may be a more accurate published estimate out there, I'm just going on trends . . . I'll reboot into Windows and see if I can get you more accurate info off our share drive).<p>[Edit]: Okay, so the 15th was the day of the biggest releases, ranging up to 12000 μsV/hr. Reactor 2 had an explosion at 0610 local, the reactor 4 fire was from 0600 to 1116 and there was a second explosion at reactor 2 at 1006. The 12000 μSv/hr peak is around 0930 with a second peak of 8800 at about 1000. I'm just looking at a graph, but it appear to decay down to around 300 μSv/hr over the rest of the day, then there's another, unlabeled event at about midnight. The metadata says the image was taken at 0858. This is in the middle of the upsurge. The area could be anywhere between 1000 μSv/hr and 12000 μSv/hr.<p>Are there other pictures available from different times?",1303084375
2457389,comment,2457332,2457332,20,0,bigiain,,,"It seems to me that this submission (and the other recent Google code quality submission) are an amusing but perhaps misleading sidetrack. Google isn't what it is because of Larry's language choice or his coding chops. It's _much_ more about the idea and execution of page rank.<p>In one sense, this is the classic path trodden by people who listen to all the good advice available here. The idea of page rank was worth very little. What Larry did was learn enough programming chops to build a prototype, then used then prototype to prove the idea worked, then iterated better and better versions as the requirements became more clear and as the bottlenecks became apparent.<p>This is exactly the sort of advice I'd give today to anyone with ""an idea"" - learn enough to code up a quick prototype. If you're starting from scratch, choose a modern fashionable language since it'll probably give you an enthusiastic community of people prepared to give advice and help when you get stuck. (right now, my choice would probably be between Ruby and Haskell). Don't worry too much about code beauty or scaleability or efficiency yet - there's a very high chance your idea will turn out to be not such a great one, and you'll either pivot a few times to find a variation on the idea that is great, or drop it altogether for the next ""great idea"", so don't fall into the trap of investing more effort than required too early. Have a plan for how you'll do it ""properly"" if you get traction, but first just get something running quickly to see if anybody is likely to pay you for it...",1303084312

I read her work only recently and was surprised to find out that she confirmed many of the conclusions I had reached, often quite painfully, myself. She provided the philosophical (theoretical) framework for those conclusions, which further helped me connect the outstanding dots.<p>She urges people to relentlessly ask the question why, to examine every premise for every important idea that guides our lives, to follow that premise to its roots, to look for contradictions. I put in the effort to do just that with her philosophy, and that effort matched the brainpower I had needed to build some of my most complex programs and models.<p>I am 30 now, but I really wish to have read her work when I was 20.

If you buy a car, for instance, or you buy anything on credit, there are clear legal requirements for what has to appear on your receipt -- because it can be so misleading.<p>As a side note, I'm really sorry I used the word ""deceive"", which implies intent. Misleading is a much better word. I don't think there was any malevolent intent in that graphic at all.<p>There are a couple questions here: first, is the metaphor being used appropriately? I think not. I think it could be done a lot better. Second, does the metaphor of a receipt even work enough to be useful at all? I don't know, but if you want to try to use a metaphor for cognitive leverage on this particular problem, a receipt is probably the best thing you've got.<p>As computer guys, we have to deal with and talk about complex systems all the time. Using metaphors is part of that. It's probably the best tool we have. The reason I commented in the first place was to show that if you pick up a metaphor, you have to run with it as far as you can, then clearly point out where the metaphor no longer works. To do otherwise is to invite a lot of confusion, and, well, to be misleading.",1303083696

2457334,comment,2456994,2456994,13,0,Todd,,,"First off, keep things simple. Don't dive into Linux, Emacs/VIM, etc. right away if you don't already know them. Your goal is to learn programming.<p>Next, you probably have an idea about where you want to be with your business. Is it mobile? Is it web? I'll assume the latter, because even if it's the former, you're going to need both eventually.<p>Even though it's not programming, you need to know HTML/CSS. Start there, even though it's not programming. You can get your feet wet editing and you can add programming shortly.<p>Start with a simple but capable editor. If you're on Windows, start with Komodo Edit or Notepad++. On Mac, something like TextMate. You can always 'upgrade' to Emacs/VIM later.<p>Once you're comfortable with basic HTML, you'll probably want to make it do things. You can start with JavaScript. This makes programming exercises simple and quick. Just refresh the page.<p>Once you decide you need a bigger challenge, then a larger world of choices becomes available: what server side language (Python and C# are two options), what server (Linux is pretty standard), what web server (Apache or Nginx are good), what database (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, etc...) are some of the many choices to be made.<p>I would first survey the above and decide what you think you might need, then pick the language based on that. Let's say you pick Python. Start playing with it from the command line or with your editor like you did with HTML. Once you understand the basics, then pick a web framework (like Django) and start making it produce the HTML that you now understand.<p>It's a stepwise process. The goal is to pick off small, achievable pieces, and then use them to build something more substantial. The core of it all, though, is programming. Programming is how you make the gears turn the way you want them to. Eventually, everything will start making sense and you'll just add to your repertoire as the needs arise.",1303082371

2457308,comment,2456994,2457105,3,0,SpookyAction,,,"I agree with the generalities of the response but disagree with some of the particulars. Learning programming should be language agnostic. The ""best"" language is the one that works for you. Everyone is different and every language is different, some work for some but not others. I'm primarily a Perl person, not that Python is bad, but it's not my language of choice. I advise experimenting with different languages and finding the one that best suits your mindset and needs. For me, Perl is the one that ""clicked"" with me. I like using it and am productive in it. I've experimented with many other languages (Python included), but Perl just fit me the best. I see the power of other languages and am constantly impressed by what I see others doing in different languages, but ultimately the ""best"" language is the one that works for you. Even when it comes down to development tools, I'm a vi person. Emacs has it's benefits, but I prefer vi. Pick what works for you. For web development the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is arguably the most popular. Most of the open-source CMS platforms such as Drupal and Joomla use it. Facebook is built in PHP on Apache and Linux. I respect PHP as a web programming language, it's accessible, has many of the conveniences of Perl (without many of the idiosyncrasies) and is web-centric. There's a reason it's popular on the web. Experiment and pick what seems to work best for you. There's no single solution. As we say in the Perl world, TMTOWTDI, There's More Than One Way To do It.",1303081957

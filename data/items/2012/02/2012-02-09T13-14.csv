3571112,comment,3569151,3570204,2,0,hexagonc,,,"<i>Inventing hard things is hard, but copying other people's inventions is significantly easier</i><p>Copying is only easier if you can reverse-engineer what they did.  Sometimes, just seeing the invention brought to fruition provides enough clues for any skilled tradesman to reproduce the parts that are unrevealed.  Well if that's true, then the patent should not have been granted in the first place, like you said!  Remember, ideas by themselves aren't supposed to be patentable, only implementations of ideas.  You see, the patent doesn't become violated just by writing or communicating about it.  The violation occurs when you build something that <i>really starts doing</i> what the patents describes.  The problem with software patents are precisely how fuzzy this distinction can become.<p>Software is special precisely because it is so general and flexible.  Take the 'one-click' patent that you cited above. Suppose web browsers were built with macros so that you could script them to automatically verify shipping address and payment info upon clicking ""buy"" and confirm the order.  To the end-user, this would be functionally equivalent to the ""one-click"".  Should this macro behavior be blocked?  What if an e-commerce site distributes a script for implementing one-click functionality that can be installed by customers?  Would this violate the patent?  I'm not sure.",1328795897

The amount could depend on the type of work, and/or proportional to the profit generated, so that hobbyists who only copy stuff for personal use pay at the lowest bracket and people who make a lot of money out of other people's IP pay more, just like taxes.<p>Are there any obvious downsides to the idea?",1328795543

This doesn't mean that they have desirable properties in real-world implementations, compared to classical algorithms such as hash-tables, binary trees, tries, ...<p>However, they are not completely useless in practice, as they usually bring up new ideas that, if properly engineered, can improve on ""classical"" algorithms.

Despite the fact that Quirks Mode is not identical, it is a similar enough case (And one that should be familiar to every browser vendor) that ignoring its example when considering vendor prefixes suggests either willful ignorance or an extreme desire to hope for the best and ignore the consequences.<p>It's bad enough that -webkit prefixes are putting Mozilla, Opera, and Microsoft in this position, but imagine what this situation could be doing now, or could do down the road, to innovation in this space? If history repeats itself and we end up with a browser monoculture again, how can a new contender enter the browser space if pages are full of badly documented, unspecified vendor prefixes?<p>From the outside, vendor prefixes look like they originated as a passive response to the slowness of W3C standardization and the behavior of W3C participants. When you look at some of the W3C minutes - <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.h...</a> as an example - they are full of examples of participants who either do not realize their lack of knowledge or are actively attempting to hinder discussion. If it takes months or years to standardize a basic feature, should it be a surprise that frustrated browser developers roll a feature out behind a vendor prefix and the entire web adopts it as a de-facto standard? The presence of these vendor prefixes should have sounded alarm bells for everyone involved in web standardization, and action should have been taken to address it then and there. At this point, I'm not sure anything can be done except to attempt to reduce the damage.<p>As a web author, dealing with prefixes is miserable. Each vendor version of the prefix might have different accepted values or even have a slightly different name, and I have to go through and manually test in each browser. If I make changes to my CSS rules, I need to ensure that I update them all to match and deal with differences in syntax. The documentation for how to do this is spotty and it introduces a ton of room for mistakes in what should have been a simple part of the web development process.<p>As a user, prefixes are a disaster. I've got a fairly recent Android phone, and because Android is a fragmentation trainwreck, the stock browser on my phone is outdated and buggy and doesn't support lots of modern web content. To deal with this, I installed a third party browser from the Market, and I can use it to view modern web content successfully. Unfortunately, a large number of the sites I visit mess up useragent sniffing and serve me webkit-only CSS or even webkit-only JS.

If this were not true, most if not all summa cum laude graduates would own, instead of just work for, a company; they succeeded in traditional education, but know nothing about finance.<p>The two others are completely off. RDPD was never meant to be an instruction booklet on how to become rich, much less how to get rich in real estate. He also misunderstood the concept of ""paying yourself first"" to mean ""don't pay your taxes,"" which is simply false. He made it sound like Kiyosaki is some selfish person who is demanding the rest of the world to be the same; but if you read the rest of the book, he actually points out that rich people are very unselfish, because they give what other people want: jobs, products, services, etc., as opposed to those who just want to be paid more despite being mediocre. He also said that if you want to be rich, you have to give other people what they want.<p>Kiyosaki's example about being ""inspired"" by the screaming of creditors and the government is nothing more than that: a personal example. He didn't say everyone should follow that example. In fact, he said a couple of paragraphs later: ""If you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works for you."" And he said a few paragraphs prior: ""If you cannot get control of yourself, do not try to get rich. You might first want to join the Marine Corps or some religious order so you can get control of yourself."" He's clear about the dangers of falling to the temptation of spending on consumer debt and using investment to cover it up.<p>Also, that little bit about child labor is odd. It's not like Rich Dad was trying to make millions from his son and his friend. It was more of a lesson to show how employees live their lives; personal experience tends to be a more powerful teacher, after all.<p>Saying that, I admit that some of the stories in some of his other books were simply repeated from this one.

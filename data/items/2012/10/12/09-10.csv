It seems so backwards and nostalgic.  Print imposed restrictions on size, format, timelyness, access, single voice (no comments), among others.  The description of ""The Magazine"" sounds like what HN or Reddit already is.<p>Also something so pretentious to call itself ""The Magazine"" is gonna be filled with poseur hacks.

4644392,comment,4644230,4644304,3,0,rayiner,,,"> I think women have more attractive choices<p>Possibly, but what makes engineering different from say law? My engineering class was 28% female, and the engineering team I worked on after graduating was 5% female. My law school class was 45% female, and my law firm starting class is about 45% female as well.<p>I can't think of a principled way to distinguish law from engineering in terms of gender attractiveness, other than the culture of the respective fields. I don't think it's aptitude. The male-female gap on the SAT Math is about the same as the male-female gap on the LSAT. I don't think it's attractiveness. Law isn't any more fun than engineering. In your words: ""you sit in front of a screen al day and wreck your brain."" It's analytical, detail work, not unlike debugging code. Yet, women seem to self select into at a relatively similar rate to men.<p>I'll also note: women make up the majority of accountants and auditors and 45% of accountants at accounting firms. Talk about boring detail oriented jobs!",1350035810

Isn't the real issue here that there are so few female programmers, computer scientists and researchers, i.e. the people actually <i>making</i> tech? Whether there are insufficient numbers of women in tech company marketing roles to effectively market products at a female audience seems to be a totally separate issue and ... well, somehow less problematic to me. It also seems quite demeaning to suggest that the only reason a girl would want to get into tech is to work at targeting advertising and PR at her own gender.<p>How about a campaign to drastically improve science, math and computer science teaching at school from a young age, and work hard to ensure both genders get enough exposure so that the kids with the most aptitude and passion, whatever their gender, get a real chance to choose tech as a career path, instead of this marketing and PR bullshit?",1350035244
4644371,comment,4644230,4644315,1,0,rayiner,,,"I think it's disingenuous to chalk up the underrepresentation of women in the tech sector to merely self-selection. You really have to examine the structural issues that might cause women to select out of a well-paying, in demand career.<p>I'll use the legal field as an example because I think there is a lot the technology field can learn from it. Women had been allowed into law school and admitted into state bars since the turn of the century. However, as of 1960, 96% of law students were men. In the 1970s, law schools and law firms took affirmative steps to encourage women to join the profession. By the late 1990s, enrollment was almost even.<p>Today, 45% of law students are female as are about 45% of incoming associates at large law firms. 20% of firm partners are women, and about a third of newly-promoted partners are women. Neither law schools nor law firms take directed affirmative steps anymore to recruit women (beyond the usual affinity groups and the like). The gender equalization efforts were self-propagating. Once the field had a critical mass of women, women self-selected into the field at similar rates to men.<p>I think it's weak to assume that women just don't want to do engineering work. Would the number of women who wanted to go into engineering be as low today if there were a reasonable number of women already in the field? I don't think so.",1350035183

Both are genuine questions that need to be addressed. Even if you are willing to accept that women need to be equally represented in tech as self evident or fundamental, you should still find out the real reasons why things are this way if you want to fix it.<p>Any answers that you come up with to the ""why"" question need to answers it in a way that doesn't equally apply to law, medicine, academics & government. Professions that women entered a generation ago.<p>In any case, I'm only half convinced about the economic rationale given by this article: <i>We need women to design stuff for women</i>. It is a definitely a real problem people designing tech products are disconnected from many of the people using tech products. But women are the one ""group"" that technology designing men <i>do</i> interact with. I think if you want to add useful perspectives something to encourage might be technology as a second career.

At the moment, the tech industry has a surplus of jobs and not enough bodies to fill the desks, so what we need is more people, irrespective of age, gender, race, etc.<p>In my opinion, it is extremely sexist to even suggest that we need more women in tech, it implies that the (large amount of) men who are currently in the industry are not doing their jobs correctly and should be replaced by women, that women would do a better job; granted, some women would do a better job, but so would some men.<p>You can not force equality (a thing which you already have) upon the masses, but look at it like this, there aren't less women in tech because men don't want them there, there are just less women who are inclined to go in to technology, this isn't a case of ""Male oppression is forcing us not to follow our dream"", it's merely a case of less women having this dream.<p>Let's be honest, from our earliest childhood years, we are given this impression that certain activities are for certain genders, and yes, to some degree this is wrong, I happen to like the colour pink and my sister absolutely loved playing in dirt, to my mothers disdain, but these young character building years are what defines us, the fact is that there are two genders, not one, and they are not always equal, we need to celebrate these differences instead of trying to subdue them in to none-existence.<p>Personally, the finest developer I have ever met was a woman, so I have nothing against women in tech, but let's look at the fact, from a young age, boys are taught that playing computer games is a boys thing, playing these games often fosters a natural ability to understand computers.<p>If you play model of honour enough times, you begin to recognize the path finding model which the computer takes, and at a very primal level you begin to understand the most simple AI elements, this experience builds your understanding of how computers works. I'm not saying this is the <i>only</i> way to get in to computers, I'm just giving the example which was relevant to myself.<p>tl;dr: Stop blaming men for the lack of women in tech, take a look at your own base camp, men have given you equality for years now, just accept that most women don't want to go in to tech; not because they are women, but because, let's face it, we're a big bunch of nerds and foreveraloners and most sane people would do anything they could to stay out of this space.",1350034852

In fact, nowadays most people who graduate from university are women.<p>Given all that, I get the impression that the constant hand-wringing about the dearth of women in tech is more about companies hoping to expand the labor pool for what is still a highly-sought and well-paid profession, rather than about empowering women to do what they want.

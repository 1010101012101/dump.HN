You may be smarter & more articulate; you may be able to debate them into the ground without breaking a sweat; but if you&#x27;re on the privileged side and they&#x27;re not, you&#x27;re probably still wrong in this discussion, and you&#x27;re not going to <i>help</i> that situation at all by being <i>articulately</i> wrong.<p>Just speaking for myself -- and I&#x27;m on the &quot;winning&quot; side of almost every privilege imbalance I can think of -- but it is not really possible for someone like me to get an natural grasp of what I&#x27;m really gaining.

7123074,comment,7121140,7122992,1,0,Spearchucker,,,"&quot;<i>The agile push came people who were reacting against creating pages of useless design up front documentation</i>&quot;<p>er, what? The agile push came from people who saw an opportunity to make money [1]. To understand that you need to understand both the advantages of waterfall, it&#x27;s disadvantages, and how those disadvantages were mitigated. Documentation is but a single (and pretty minor) aspect of it.<p>The biggest single issue with waterfall is also is biggest advantage - segmentation (what Barry Boehm called segments or stages of a project). Stages follow each other sequentially. Requirements analysis follows inception, design follows requirements analysis, development follows design, test development, and so forth.<p>The advantage is that it is predictable (ironically, agile&#x27;s biggest <i>dis</i>advantage). It&#x27;s disadvantage is that it&#x27;s crazy expensive to reverse the sequence, i.e. go from test back to dev, from dev back to design, and so on.<p>The mitigations back in the early 80&#x27;s were to prototype (fail fast) and to turn a single protracted release into many smaller releases (what became known as the spiral model) - aka fail often. In amongst all of that TDD happened, and someone decided to turf documentation because everyone hates doing it anyway.<p>eXtreme programming came along and gave protyping and iterative releases a shiny new badge. Pair programming wasn&#x27;t for everyone, so someone removed that, added daily standups and gave it a shiny old name (scrum was first applied to product development in the early 80&#x27;s and formally documented in &#x27;86[2] - it was nothing like what it is today).<p>Oh, and modern agile processes contract release cycles even more.<p>Note that there are other intrinsic (requirements almost always missing/incomplete, stages produce communication gaps, and as you mention, documentation) and extrinsic issues (it&#x27;s a pm methodology, not a dev methodology) with waterfall.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-teenage-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-teenage-crisis</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.wittenburg.co.uk/Entry.aspx?id=dce9dde8-d770-47c2-ad66-937cfabadb59"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wittenburg.co.uk/Entry.aspx?id=dce9dde8-d770-47c...</a>",1390693841

What I am saying is that there are two parties in any disagreement and it cannot always be the case that the person who speaks first is always wrong and the person who judges their speech is always right. Sometimes people take offence for bad reasons, or in bad faith, and they create just as much of a distraction as those with legitimate complaints. So we cannot say that the mere existence of a distraction should cause the author/creator to change their product in order to avoid further distraction.<p>There needs to be <i>some</i> commonly-accepted understanding of what constitutes legitimate grounds for offence.

7123049,comment,7123012,7123012,13,0,MAGZine,,,"A quick dive into any PHP-related topic on HN should yield significant answers. Part of the hatred comes from the fact that the way people know PHP is from 2005, when it was essentially one really long procedural program. It&#x27;s not so much that people ignore the recent upgrade in tooling/modern language constructs so much as people aren&#x27;t familiar that they exist.<p>However, these is still a lot of vitrol for PHP. Because it is so easy to use, many people are able to pick it up without any prior SE experience--these people tend to create poorly-designed, slow-running, and, perhaps worst of all, dangerous (vis a vis security) code.<p>The other major complaint that exists has to do with inconsistency/insanity in PHP&#x27;s function signatures/naming/evolution. For example: mysql_escape_string and it&#x27;s sister, mysql_real_escape_string. Although, anyone working with modern PHP probably will never touch these functions.<p>What is overlooked is that it has an extensive base of developers, it DOES scale (this is proven), and the language is improving (as well as the tooling (PHPUnit, XHProf, CI tools), frameworks, package management etc). And although Facebook does use it, it&#x27;s important to note that, AFAIK, PHP only exists as a thin layer in between &quot;display HTML&quot; and &quot;communicating with backend servers which are going to handle the majority of the work, save for presentation-layer type stuff.&quot;<p>There are a few alternatives to PHP, but they each have their warts too.

The plan went that once a critical mass of teachers from a given institution where onboard and using it, we would trigger the enterprise sales approach and sell the product to the institution.<p>We had some uptake from teachers, who universally loved the product. They raved about it in fact. We were super excited. We thought we were onto a winner.<p>They told their friends and colleagues who in turn signed up, and they too loved it. And raved about it. And told their friends about it.<p>Unfortunately the vast majority of them never actually delivered a course on it with live students.  We were stunned.<p>After prodding and asking, and eventually getting to the bottom of it, we found that whilst the vast majority of teachers loved the product, and loved the idea of using it for their courses, they wouldn&#x27;t use a product that wasn&#x27;t centrally supported by the institution (or even in quite a few cases, couldn&#x27;t use a product that was specifically prohibited by their institution - they were only allowed to use the prescribed LMS, which in most cases was Blackboard or Moodle).<p>So my tip for entrepreneurs trying to break into the enterprise LMS space is appreciate your an enterprise sales company. Your users are not your buyers, and even if they <i>love</i> your product, if you aren&#x27;t selling it to the buyer you&#x27;ll die.<p>I don&#x27;t believe this is a market in which you can offer a freemium product to the individual with the intent of penetration reaching the masses through viral or other growth strategies.

Programming is hard enough for people to learn; by teaching them a language that lowers that threshold, they&#x27;ll learn more in less time.

Did those not fit the bill as lighter than Eclipse but better than Vim?",1390690819

I think Meteor is certainly the closest of such platform at the moment, but you don&#x27;t have to go far to find a developer who really hates JavaScript and will never switch over.

10260226,comment,10258475,10259356,0,0,larrys,,,"This mirrors somewhat my experience many years ago with bartering. The places that were bartering were doing so because it was some low hanging fruit way to increase business and it was easy to to. And they were places that weren&#x27;t particularly popular on their own (restaurants let&#x27;s say) so they would do bartering to bring in customers on Monday nights but not allow it for obvious reasons on Saturday or Friday night.  There is always a feeling on the part of small business owners that barter dollars are not real dollars (even though there is value in many cases) and barter business is not real business.  A place that isn&#x27;t doing that well to begin with (and once again I realize this is a generalization that is not true in many cases) is not going to have the best employees or the best attitudes because they are running short on cash and can&#x27;t pay the best wages or have the best working conditions. So it&#x27;s an entire ecosystem of mediocrity that you (in your case or me in my case) might end up experiencing.<p>So I guess in theory someone taking groupon (or barter dollars) should just be a regular business that is doing well wanting to increase business. But in actual cases it might more often (from my experience at least) be a marginal business that is trying to fix a situation with marketing that isn&#x27;t exactly going to work as planned by bringing in groupon dollars or barter dollars (that will end up being used by the owner to go out to dinner with his wife (and yes that is what happened)). Valuable things (in the case of barter dollars) that a business needs are not typically available with barter dollars. What you get is a bunch of things like dining, travel or accountants or attorneys (and how many of those do you need).",1442943633

10260211,comment,10253218,10253218,0,0,deepbasu007,,,"Being one of the authors of this paper, I think its my responsibility to clarify some of the doubts raised by some of you in this thread.<p>Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to go through the paper and raising your questions. I think most of these are valid questions and I will try to answer them here.<p>First of all, regarding the dataset creation method and the chances of having overlapping patches between training and test sets - as we mentioned in the paper, care was taken to avoid this specific scenario where a homogeneous landcover area was first sampled and then 28x28 patches extracted from it occur both in training and test sets. For this, once we selected the set of 1500 tiles from the NAIP dataset, we separated the tiles into spatially/geographically distant areas and then used these two areas for extracting the training and test patches respectively.<p>Now, regarding the comparison with raw pixel based DBN and CNN. As benanne suggested that we claimed that DBN is better suited than CNN for this task, in contrast, I would like to clarify that in the paper, we claim that the integration of Haralick features with the DBN yields better results than either of DBN or CNN with raw pixels. In fact, validating the popular belief, we show that DBN alone is indeed inferior to CNN on this task same as what benanne states. Now, the question arises - why didn’t we use bigger CNNs with higher number of layers - may be 5 or 6 for the experiments? Here, I would like to point everyone to the paper “ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” where the authors trained a deep CNN with 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. But we can see that the dataset used in that paper consists of 256x256 images. As the theory of CNN suggests, a CNN models the human visual cortical system that builds a hierarchical model of the image in such a way that bigger images require deeper nets to encode all the contextual dependencies between neighboring pixels and to perform a hierarchical clustering from the features to labels. So, in contrast to their dataset, we see that the images in our dataset are only 28x28 which means that we need to scale down our model to avoid significant overfitting which can’t even be avoided with L2 regularization or Dropout. Also, if we consider results on another object recognition dataset, namely CIFAR-10, which is 32x32 (roughly equal in size to our images), most of the state-of-the-art results on this dataset (like Deeply Supervised nets and Network in Network) uses an architecture with 3 convolutional layers and 1 fully-connected layer same as the one we considered. Also, in the Imagenet classification paper, while using the significantly being and Deep networks, in order to avoid overfitting the authors use techniques like data augmentation and dropout. So, effectively the model would be bigger and take longer to train while the integration of the texture based features with the Deep Belief Network saves us this overhead which is significant for a 65 TB dataset (It should be noted that our goal in this research is not just to handle this dataset but to use this as a pilot to develop an algorithm that can scale for landcover classification to the whole of continental US).  
Now someone might ask, why we chose 28x28 in the first place? Its because an important difference between satellite image classification and object based classification is that given an image with a bigger context, we say if a particular object is present in a scene or not (for e.g., CIFAR, Imagenet etc.). On the other hand for satellite imagery, what we need is a near accurate per-pixel labelling. So, choosing a smaller window removes most of the contextual information required for a per-pixel scene classification and choosing a bigger window means loosing the statistical properties of the object of interest - e.g., a tree or bush might be much smaller than a 64x64 window which covers a spatial area of 64mx64m. To conclude, I would like to stress the fact that out of traditional DBN, CNN and SDAE, CNNs are probably the best suited to handle these kinds of datasets and that is also proved in the experiments in the paper. However, I would like to re-iterate that in this research we try to show that even if Deep Neural Networks - DBN, CNN or SDAE are good as general-purpose learning machines and are versatile to suit a large number of different datasets - ranging from handwritten digits to facial recognition to object recognition, but, there are situations where we need to integrate these models with domain specific knowledge to help improve the learning efficiency of the model in the light of the particular decision problem at hand.<p>Also, “inherently high variability” is not a problem if we are ready to use bigger networks which in turn require higher number of training samples (according to the theory of learning for neural nets) and higher training time. However, as I told earlier in order to improve the overall efficiency of the learning algorithm to be scalable across millions of scenes covering the whole of US, the integration of DBN with handcrafted features seem to be very useful at this point of time.",1442943479

I have been analyzing both Lending Club and Prosper data for my institutional clients for almost 4 years now. While OP made a good first attempt on analyzing the data, the analysis suffers from two major shortcomings that I normally see from people getting started with data analysis.<p>1. Domain Knowledge: Novice analyst tend to put the data in a blender and see what comes out first instead of building some preliminary knowledge and intuition about the domain. This is quite evident in OP&#x27;s analysis and finding about annual income. A person familiar with domain will ask the question &quot;Why would a borrower with high annual income will borrow a small amount loan at high interest rate?&quot; This right away will raise flags about risks of lending to such borrowers. OP will benefit by reading some of the publications (books, research) on credit scoring and modeling before deep diving into analyzing Lending Club data.<p>2. Data Exploration: Not spending enough time exploring the data can lead to erroneous conclusion like The second chance strategy. When did Lending Club start issuing loans to borrowers with delinquencies and public records has a big impact on returns as newer loans are not aged enough to have sufficient defaults.<p>> Watch for your average return (expected return), consistency of returns through time (risk), while making sure there is enough supply (liquidity) on the platform to deploy your strategy.<p>Time is not Risk. You need to find a proper measure for risk. Also consider negative kurtosis and frequent low positive returns but a few high negative returns nature of return distribution.<p>> I considered that investors deploy and re-invest their money continuously on the platform and therefore own a portfolio with different ‘vintages’ of loans. The ROI that are computed reflect this, as they are average returns across vintages.<p>Re-consider this argument of &quot;average return across vintages&quot; being representative of investor returns. Tip: look at loan volume across vintages as well as typical re-investment pattern of a typical investor.<p>> Please also note than due to the low issuance volume in the early days of the platform, the returns computed for the pre-2010 period are much less reliable than the post-2010 returns.<p>Please don&#x27;t do this. The data between 2006 and 2010 is the most valuable due to the business cycle we were in at that time. The data since 2010 tells nothing about how loans might perform in the future when business cycle is not as good it has been in last few years.<p>OP will really benefit from re-evaluating his finings with critical eyes. I will suggest gaining some domain knowledge, spending lot of time on just exploring the data before start drawing definite conclusions, focusing on distributions, correlations and statistical significance.",1442942941

This is probably overkill over a cheaper CRC.  In addition, it means that users have to make 2 passes to upload -- first to compute the hash and then another to upload.  This can slow uploads of large objects dramatically.  A better method is to allow users to omit the hash and return it in the upload response.  Then compare that response with a hash computed while uploading.  In the rare case that the object was corrupted in transit, delete/retry.

However, these places often do not show any higher cancer incidence (or other relevant health problems) than other areas, possibly suggesting some sort of limit before radiation becomes harmful (the Threshold model).<p>Some studies actually show significantly lower cancer incidence than other areas. This has prompted the idea of Radiation hormesis, that low doses above background have some benefit. We do know that low doses do stimulate cell repair mechanisms in different ways than large doses do, so it does seem possible (although real-world data is mixed). The effects are not well understood at present, and it&#x27;s an area that is under ongoing study. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s an absolute devil to research!",1442941215
10259913,comment,10258600,10259315,0,0,mattdm,,,"I don&#x27;t think &quot;utter disregard for bug reports&quot; paints an accurate picture. Remember, the vast majority of packages are maintained by volunteers, with different day jobs. (This is often true even for those with @redhat.com email — their day job is usually RHEL or OpenStack or OpenShift, and Fedora may or may not be part of that.) So, response time, attitude, and even expertise available to fix the issue varies. For some packages, you&#x27;ll get great response (ever tried to file a bug against SELinux? I&#x27;d be surprised if your issue wasn&#x27;t fixed in a magically small window, because those people are crazy awesome and on top of it). For others... well, yeah.<p>Many packagers aren&#x27;t even coders — they&#x27;re sysadmins or end-users who needed the software packaged up — and if the bug is in the upstream code rather than the _packaging_, they may not be properly qualified. They _should_ help the user negotiate the process of getting a fix from upstream, but sometimes that&#x27;s hard too when the packager can&#x27;t reproduce.<p>For some packages, bugs are a firehose. Triaging alone can be a full-time job. We&#x27;ve had some efforts at triage teams, but those have generally died out due to burnout. (Help wanted if you have any ideas, though.)",1442941200

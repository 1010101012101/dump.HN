That really does suck.<p>EDIT: Scratch that.  It's the partnership laws of the state, not the agreement that he apparently had issues with.  Still depressing, but at least not as idiotic as I thought.",1218344339
272173,comment,272031,272071,0,0,gunderson,,,"This is a good point.  You might want to use passenger if you lack sysadmin skills. The big pain of Rails is keeping your thin/mongrel/etc processes running, etc.  I imagine a slicehost $20/month slice would run passenger mod_rails just fine and would be fine for your hobby project or something small.",1218344291

I have tried Joyent and it's good but you have to learn a bunch of Solaris skills and many gems don't work quite right on Solaris, and I've tried Engineyard but nobody will return my emails to set up an account.<p>Slicehost has never done anything but offer consistent, professional service.  I could not recommend them more highly.",1218344209

Fotolog.com, se escribe como suena.""  [You spell it the way it sounds; it's phonetic.]<p>I agree with you that most names are hard to spell, but in Spanish having a phonetic name is important because the language itself is phonetic.",1218343931

IMHO, a lot of the progress in New York can be directly attributed to Rudy and his team. They really cleaned up this place. Nevertheless, Columbia should get a fare share of credit by pouring tons of money into the area.<p>When I moved here in 2000 the area was already on the up and up but really hit its stride when Columbia went on a building spree. They built three buildings within one block of my apartment which really raised the bar for this immediate area.<p>But wait, there's more! Soon Columbia will begin construction on an entire new campus on the far west edge of Harlem called Manhattanville. This will really push the entire area much higher and bring a lot of opportunity to those that live here now.",1218341815

2056288,comment,2054992,2055835,0,0,javert,,,"No, you're wrong.<p>The author's statement amounted to: ""WoW is meaningless for me and negatively impacts my life."" forensic's statment amount to: ""Well, who's to say life itself is any more meaningful?"" My response is: ""Wait a minute, I think it is meaningful."" And I pointed out that you can achieve happiness in life (and by that I mean genuine self-esteem, not some temporary hedonistic pleasure like you get from playing a video game).<p>You're also wrong in that backing WAS offered for the claim that time spent on WoW is wasteful; the blogger talks about that a lot, e.g. how you end up just getting more gear so you can go to a bigger dungeon and get more gear, and how spending too much time on WoW blocks you from pursuing major goals in real life (like becoming a paramedic).",1293825522

2056286,comment,2056020,2056184,0,0,jeromec,,,"Allow me to clarify the ""only an idea"" issue. Ideas by themselves are not worth very much. They are just a starting point, and they usually change as the business evolves. Successfully building out a project requires many things. Programming the backend is just one part of it. Another crucial, often overlooked, piece of the puzzle is effective marketing. As a developer I would <i>love</i> to partner with someone who had zero web skills but was a tenacious salesperson, the kind that didn't take no for an answer. Someone willing to pound the pavement, make the phone calls, do whatever it takes to get the marketing job done. (In fact anyone who is such a person please contact me, email is in the profile) The problem is when people don't bring anything to a project at all but the idea. An idea by itself doesn't do anything; it doesn't move, take action or otherwise do anything to grow a business, so a person thinking an idea only is something that would motivate programmers is sadly mistaken.",1293825461
2056285,comment,2053228,2055777,0,0,elblanco,,,"I disagree that the original response was not an argument. I'd ask that you review Anderson's letter again. I'm also unsure why you are attempting to connect epideictic rhetoric (used in several places in the letter) to the logical flaw in question since the rhetoric you are raising occurs after the flaw in paragraph.<p><a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/ukca.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/ukca.pdf</a><p>It's presented as an argument, it lists flaws in the UK Card Association's reasoning asking for censorship of the research. It presents a clear conclusion ~""we will not censor the thesis"" supported by clearly labeled premises, specifically:<p>1) The Card Association incorrectly addressed the complaint so they are asking the wrong people to censor the thesis<p>2) Because powerful groups are against a research area is not reason to censor the work. I can see how one might find this premise confusing since he only dwells on it for the first sentence of the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph is composed of the logical flaw in question, and then epideictic rhetoric about the noble business of Universities followed by an FU statement that they are also going to ensure the thesis spreads far and wide in direct opposition to the complaint. In other words, the second paragraph is a mess.<p>The argument of the premise is simple and is in fact an admonition against the logical flaw the complainant is using ""we are strong so you must do as we say"", but Anderson blends and conflates it with rhetoric and the flaw, concluding ""thus we have no choice but to back him, that would hold even if we did not agree with the material!""<p>3) The thesis is not new information anyways, so to ask for its censor makes no sense.<p>4) The source was not made available, so to the consumer of the thesis, they only have knowledge that the vulnerability exists, ergo they are asking to censor something that does not harm<p>5) The test of the thesis was not fraud, as the complainants claim, therefore asking for censorship under that claim makes no sense.<p>6) That the thesis exposes a vulnerability that undermines public confidence in the security of the system, but since the flaw has been apparently fixed, there is no reason to censor the thesis.<p>Conclusion) We will not censor the thesis because the logic of the premises hold true that the thesis should not be censored.<p>I do agree with you that the original response is not a formal logical argument in the strictest sense, and has elements of rhetoric (particularly in the 2nd premise), but it's clearly framed as at the very least a rational argument.<p>The letter in it's entirety are certainly not epideictic by any of my understandings of the term nor by your link. However, both the second and sixth premises contain elements of epideictic rhetoric. (btw, the presence of the logical flaw doesn't necessarily invalidate the 2nd premise since the passage is non-sequitur to the premise anyways!)<p>I think that's what you are trying to say here <i>And not everything you say, even in the course of an argument, is itself argument.</i> And I would agree with that sentiment. However, in this case, the sentence in question is clearly part of a logical argument and is a classic usage of a logical flaw.<p>I fully understand how Anderson would have written such a thing, impassioned as he must be over the issue. I actually found his argument persuasive and much milder in tone than I would have managed.",1293825427

2056276,comment,2054847,2055558,0,0,avner,,,"I tried to start a hardware startup last year and actually made it to the interview with PG & co. At the end of the meeting, while the idea was good, it came down to the obvious question of assembling and sourcing the hardware. At that stage, after a lot of research and thinking, I decided to cut my losses and shelf the idea for the time being.<p>Why? Because hardware is hard. I may be an engineer, but scaling production of a hardware unit from a prototype to shippable products en masse is an extremely hard challenge if you're trying to source your hardware from somewhere like China. Its harder if you're not Apple or HP..or Sony for that matter. I think its unfair to judge wakemate to Sony or Apple standards.<p>Coincidentally, I met the Wakemate guys when I crashed at the SF hacker house during that time. While they're brilliant and dextrous folks, I certainly felt the vibe that they were finding it <i>extremely</i> challenging to design, produce and ship this thing. The idea of wakemate sounded great, but I wasn't convinced that being non-tech founders, they were entirely aware of the technical and logistical challenges of producing and scaling a hardware unit from scratch to the production line.<p>I wish them luck though. While they could learn a lesson or two about PR, they've been at it for over an year and have persisted. Customer patience may be running thin after these series of setbacks, but I still believe that they will eventually pull it off.",1293825222

2056250,comment,2055939,2055939,0,0,tjr,,,"I still buy printed books. I almost never buy any books at a major book retail store like Borders or BN because they carry very very little that I am interested in buying. They used to stock more that I was interested in, but their stock has changed over the years. I suppose they were aiming for a more middle-of-the-road, palatable-to-all sort of stock selection, but I for one have basically been driven away.<p>I initially reason, well, I must be a very unusual shopper. I buy a lot of books on programming topics, math, science, etc., and I eschew with passion anything written for dummies, idiots, fools, or morons.<p>But then I wonder, am I really so unusual? I'm not an expert historian, but I enjoy studying history, and I'm disappointed with the local store's selection of history books about as much as I am with their technology books. I enjoy studying linguistics, and have watched the store's linguistics section melt away into nothingness. I enjoy science fiction, but am dismayed to see shelves of fantasy displace books by my favorite authors.<p>I can't really speak for every subject matter, but for pretty much every topic I want to read about, the big chain bookstores seem to be dwindling their stock, and smoothing out what little they do carry to appeal to some unknown typical readership.<p>If this is indeed true of all (or even most) of the subjects of books they carry, then I find it hard to believe that anyone who truly enjoys reading books is content with what they carry. Which leaves...  people who really aren't very fond of books to peruse the shelves? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense to me.<p>I would greatly enjoy doing more book shopping in person.

Compare to something like getting in shape, at which point the net result is ""I've improved my health and added 15 years to my life"" or to learning a skill that helps you contribute to financial success or the creation of something that increases the beauty in others' lives.<p>If it were actually difficult or noteworthy to achieve things in WoW, then yes, they would be ""real"" accomplishments. However, a DBA could run a query and give you 6 years worth of ""accomplishments"" on a whim (at no cost to anyone else!). How can they be called real accomplishments when, after the varnish has been stripped away, they can be granted with six seconds of work?<p>There are some real accomplishments to be had - you might learn how to manage people, or the basics of supply and demand and arbitrage and resource speculation, or time management, or hone better reflexes and spatial awareness, etc, but none of those are ""WoW accomplishments"". What I mean to say is that WoW is not fully valueless, but that the things it presents as ""accomplishment"" are empty and meaningless at the end of the day.",1293823136

2056148,comment,2054847,2054927,0,0,bugsy,,,"Yes, if the customers are doing hardware testing it's a disaster for satisfaction, and you also have the cost of repair and shipping and recalls. It's very interesting trade off wise. When I worked in the semiconductor industry, there was a fail rate of something like 35% of chips cut from the wafer. Depending on the complexity and size of the chip relative to the wafer, that rate could go up to 90%, or down to 10%. This is because of things outside of human ability to control, microscopic defects in the substrate for example, or a single dust particle that got into the clean room. These were tested on the full sized wafer and marked with dots and then after cutting the ones with dots are tossed out. Needless to say, it is utterly crucial that significant parts of the chip design must be solely for the purpose of being able to completely test functionality on-chip. This results then in 100% functioning of things that went out the door. I've never even seen a CPU that went to a customer that had a known defect at that stage, so the step of tossing away a large number is just part of manufacturing. However in the case of manufacturing boards overseas, it is definitely possible to increase field significantly. The units were just as testable over there as they are here in the US, without the trouble of unpacking and repacking the retail boxes. But for whatever reason reform of the foreign manufacturing plant simply was not happening and not something they were interested in, and management apparently felt that the trade offs involved made sense, including all the extra rework and testing.<p>One thought that has occurred to me though is that Apple is using much more poor quality manufacturing than they were years ago, and there is a high failure rate of Apple laptops. However, they have a warranty that covers fixing everything for 1 year and everyone sane knows to buy the extended 3 year since there's something like a 1 in 4 chance you'll need it. So Apple has figured that they save enough making it in China that they can absorb the cost of fixing 25% of the ones where the customer bought AppleCare. These repairs are usually replacing the whole motherboard with spares that they buy in vast quantities for each and every model. This is all done very intentionally for sound economic reasons and customer satisfaction is very high despite the failures.",1293823061
2056147,comment,2054697,2054697,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Every life counts. But I feel like this is only showing one side of the issue. Capital is distilled, economic trust. All human beings deserve a baseline level of trust. As such, access to capital is a human right. Without some form of trust extended to those in poverty (through capital lending or otherwise) how could they ever emerge from their poverty?<p>I hope this does not sound too callous. Every single suicide is a tragedy. But only 70 of 14,364 suicides were related to microloans -- only half a percent. 70 suicides represents only one <i>millionth</i> of Andhra Pradesh's population, a state with an infant mortality rate of 5.2%. If the actions of those 70 suicides merely improve infant mortality by even one percent for one percent of the population, microfinance will have paid itself back for the health of families several fold -- and for the families who strove and succeeded, not those who, by their own actions, created a situation they did not have the willpower to escape.<p>1.2 million people a year are killed by automobiles -- and yet they have given us tremendous freedom. The solution to the problem of automobile deaths is not an outright ban, but infrastructure, norms, and education -- which can drop deaths from nearly than 80 per annum per 100,000 inhabitants in Iraq and Iran to over 50 in South Africa to less than 5 in Canada, Australia and Argentina.<p>Though hundreds die from general anaesthesia each year, its positive impact on medicine and surgery has been tremendous. The solution to these deaths is not a ban, but improved education, environmental support, and systematic changes in health care (see for example: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/09/how-american-health-care-killed-my-father/7617/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/09/how-amer...</a>)<p>Access to capital -- and more generally, access to trust, is a powerful force. Wielded properly, it is can be a tremendously powerful tool for good -- but also for harm.<p>I hope that these revelations will be a learning experience, and force us to think more deeply about how to connect with the impoverished. Clearly, access to capital alone is not enough to enable the ascension from poverty. But in many cases, it is a limiting factor. We must not retract willingness to lending of capital -- our trust in a whole class of impoverished people -- as a result of these early mistakes.",1293823046

This seems explainable in that at the end of the day a line of credit is a line of credit no matter what verbage you attach to it.

Once your basic income is eaten up in this way, you lose 30c out of your income as tax.<p>This means that the incentive to earn each subsequent dollar is essentially the same as the last.  Of course, I&#x27;m sure someone smarter than me has a better idea of what:<p>1) The basic income amount will be

8897030,comment,8894874,8895599,0,0,dalke,,,"I can actually answer some of that. The first flights were unpressurized and there was no door to break down. The first commercial flight was a Benoist seaplane which flew that trip under 50 feet altitude, though it could fly up to 1,000 feet. The first KLM flight (the oldest airline company still in service) used an Airco de Havilland 16 in 1920, a year before the first pressurized cockpit.<p>Therefore, no one would have asked about problems with low atmosphere or opening doors.<p>The Wright craft used wing warping, and not flaps, so people didn&#x27;t ask that question. What if the motor stopped - that&#x27;s a much more critical question. The Benoist seaplane flight above had problem part-way through. The pilot landed on the water, fixed the engine, and took off again.<p>As for runways, the Wrights landed on the sand in front of them, the same as Chanute did earlier with his experiments with gliders on the dunes of Michigan. The first airplane flight in New England used a frozen lake surface. Early on people used large fields, like Penn Field or Roosevelt Field. The movies of Lindberg show there wasn&#x27;t really even a marked route; I assume the better to align with the wind. Runways as we know it took a while to exist - they were airfields.<p>While I understand your intent, it would have been better to omit examples rather than make ones up. Otherwise your ahistorical comments affect my interpretation of your ability to judge an appropriate development cycle. People aren&#x27;t talking about problems which might occur after 20-30 years of development, but rather problems that are well-known already.<p>This would be like telling FÃ©lix du Temple in 1870 that steam engines aren&#x27;t powerful enough for a flying machine to carry humans.",1421376961

Red Hat has a lot of stupid defaults, but this is probably the most questionable one.<p>The useless confirmations on every deletion is so intrusive that people will instinctively try to work around it. In the best case they&#x27;ll undefine those crappy aliases in their own shell config, or maybe gravitate toward writing /bin/rm rather than rm to avoid the alias expansion. In the bad case they&#x27;ll learn that &quot;rm -f&quot; will override &quot;rm -i&quot;, and get in the habit of using that to shut rm up. Too bad that &quot;-f&quot; does more than negate &quot;-i&quot;...<p>People who don&#x27;t actively work to circumvent the braindamage will almost certainly end up reflexively teaching themselves to just answer &quot;y&quot; to the prompts without reading.

8897016,comment,8894820,8894820,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"I own a Sony Z3 which arguably is one of the few smartphones cameras which people might called as good or better than an iPhone. It also has a physical shutter button which is a major benefit (particularly in terms of time to first shot).<p>And I will happily acknowledge his point that sharing socially is a major smartphone benefit, and one I myself make use of. That&#x27;s why on my last vacation I would swap to my smartphone just to grab one &quot;for Facebook.&quot; Since I could share our vacation with friends and family literally on the day we were doing it (which much akin to &quot;I was here&quot; postcards is fun).<p>That all being said I won&#x27;t be giving up my dedicated camera just yet. My phone has a very good sensor, in particular as my main camera is m43 like the OP&#x27;s one was (except the sensors in recent m43 cameras has improved considerably over the GX1 the OP had).<p>However the main reasons why I wouldn&#x27;t even if they both had the same sensor is, firstly the physical controls on my camera are vastly superior to any &quot;app.&quot; I can control every major camera feature literally with my eyes closed (and in low light I may have well have my eyes closed). Two wheels, about five Fn buttons (completely re-bindable) and full focus control (both AF and MF).<p>My camera has a multi-touch touch screen but I rarely use it because much like my phone it is unintuitive/slow. It is great for reviewing previously taken photos/pinch-to-zoom and so on, but for actually photography it is meh. It is maybe useful for selecting auto-focus points (without having to scroll).<p>Then my second reason: Viewfinders. Regardless of if they&#x27;re EVF or OVF, viewfinders are an absolute gem to have. In strong sunlight you can actually see what is going on (!) which is often hard on even the best screens. At night there is no &quot;light leakage&quot; in particular with long exposures. You can shut the camera&#x27;s LCD off and just press your eye around the viewfinder to have no back-glow at all.<p>My third reason: Lenses. This is totally cliche, but there are limits to digital zoom. Optical zoom doesn&#x27;t reduce image quality as highly and then whatever you accomplish with optical zoom you can then digitally zoom for further magnification.<p>Then last you have a whole bunch of &quot;tiny&quot; things like: better flashes (smarter, more powerful, more directional, etc), tripod mounts, a better (bigger) grip for more stability at slower shutter speeds, better IS (due to bigger servos), and near instant startup (plus sling straps for ready to shoot in under 5 seconds from your hip and off).<p>So until Apple releases an Apple camera with tons of physical buttons/dials/hot-shoe and so on, I will keep my camera, and use my phone for Facebook family snaps.",1421376729

(The exception is if you&#x27;ve literally never read anything like the remainder of this paragraph.  In that case, you can demonstrate good faith by admitting here that your argument was faulty, and countering similar faulty &quot;exit&quot; arguments from open borders advocates in the future.)  You can leave your job at any time, but when you do so you can&#x27;t require another company to hire you, and it&#x27;s blindingly obvious that changing this state of affairs would destroy some of the best companies.  Right of exit, which I support, is protected by refugee treaties and free world military power.  A huge wave of unskilled immigration is practically certain to weaken the US enough to increase, not reduce, the number of places like North Korea that are outside the US&#x27;s military reach.<p>And your &quot;Chinese or Indian citizen&quot; example actually counters your own argument.  Both countries have far too many people for the US to absorb, and both have also succeeded for the last three decades at raising living standards for their native people by more than would be possible via any achievable amount of brute-force migration to the US (though they have a lot more to do).  Chinese and Indian &quot;right to pursue happiness&quot; has very little to do with US mass immigration policy; trade policy, technology transfer, Pax Americana, and the like have been far more relevant for a long time.<p>And even your &quot;extreme example&quot; fails spectacularly.  I am Chinese, I voluntarily work for a Chinese-owned company, I&#x27;ve spent most of the last four years in and next to Shenzhen, and these years have been very good to me.<p>With all that said, I do support loosening restrictions on migration when doing so is actually positive-sum, and I think Chinese and Indian student immigration to the US frequently qualifies.

The assistants could see the body language of participants and take that information into account when formulating advice. (In fact, assistants could flip between multiple POV and gauge the body language of a sampling of the crowd or all of the key players.) If an assistant has a piece of side knowledge, like they happen to know on sight that someone&#x27;s brooch was made by a famous craftsman, they could provide that as a conversation starter and help the executive score points. If an important person is walking up from behind, the executive could be alerted to end the conversation and so she can present her argument first.<p>As often noted around here, one can do more with more data.

Piles of radio control cars and weather stations at the front of store, cables and miscellaneous electronics accessories in the middle, components at the back. Maplin thrive on their lack of focus - you go there when you need a Lighting cable or an RJ45 faceplate, and you leave with what you came for <i>plus</i> something you didn&#x27;t know you even wanted.<p>It seems to me that the only real difference is the quality of management. Maplin were struggling in the 90s, but were bought out by a private equity firm who turned the business around.

What this means is you should maintain a low profile. Silk Road was anything but low profile. It was more like waving a red flag at a bull. E.g. from the Wiki article on Silk Road:<p><pre><code>   Once the site was known publicly, U.S. Senator
   Charles Schumer asked federal law enforcement
   authorities such as the DEA and Department of
   Justice to shut down the website.

&quot;The Eagle&quot; aka the US Federal government has almost unlimited resources. Even if you don&#x27;t attract the ire of a grandstanding Senator, you might happen to attract the attention of a bureaucrat who wants a promotion. You will be vastly outnumbered. E.g. from the article:<p><pre><code>   Deryeghiayan and a half dozen

The UA MUST ignore superfluous certificates in the chain that do not form part of the validating chain.

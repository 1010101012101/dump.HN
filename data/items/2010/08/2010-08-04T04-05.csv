Schoolwork takes up a few gigabytes in itself.<p>Also, it's not so much the software (though it is when, for instance, I work with other people or for clients) but the size of the screen. Someone did recommend an outside monitor, but that would hog the integrated graphics card a bit (which takes a bit of ram itself).<p>It's also inconvenient because it's too small, it actually hinders my schoolwork.

We got bumped by a few websites including killerstartups and thrillist a few days after we launched and we were absolutely stoked to see people actually using the site, it's a really great feeling :). Now we're in that nice quiet period after the influx of sign ups from a bump has mostly died out, which has given us a chance to quietly fix a few of the silly bugs that managed to get through alpha testing, and also change around several parts of the site. So far so good.<p>Here's what we've been trying to do to differentiate ourselves from the competition:<p>- Develop a clean, simple, easy to use interface
- Give the users clear, concise privacy options and choices
- Make it so profiles that actually have a degree of customization
- Implement a private comments system instead of yet another inbox to manage
- Create a very simple sign up process
- Give users the ability to completely hide every trace of your profile from the site temporarily
- No annoying applications, ever.
- Badges (Because everybody loves badges, right?)<p>Our future short term goals are to implement syndication with Twitter (Once I can get my head around OAuth's processes) and facebook and get a mobile version of the site up and running. We also want to see what else we can do with comments instead of just plain text. Is there anything you guys think we should do/shouldn't do?<p>I'm a long time reader of hacker news and a first time poster. I'm posting here because I'd love to hear your feedback, insights, suggestions on how we can improve Buddify.<p>http://www.buddify.com/<p>Thanks guys,

There should be no subsidies, as those economically benefit some while hurting everyone else.<p>Congress shouldn't be allowed to make complicated tax laws.  If there's to be a tax, it should be simple and described in 1 paragraph.  No exemptions, no breaks, no deductions.  Those things are all trying to encourage or discourage some sort of activity, but it just ends up helping some while hurting everyone else more.<p>Congress shouldn't be allowed to redistribute wealth.  It just helps some people while hurting everyone else and has negative secondary consequences.  It as also not a necessary role for government.<p>Every way that congress dictates that the economy should go ends up helping some group by some amount and hurting everyone else by even more.  That's sort of by definition, because if it helped everyone involved, it would take place naturally without the need to legally dictate it.<p>The domain of government is ultimately force, and when it tries to act in other areas, its monopoly on force corrupts its actions in those other areas, so it really needs to be restricted to the very simple act of protecting our rights as originally spelled out in the constitution.

The Mac version is decent, but the slow startup time of the iPhone app really destroys its utility for me.<p>That said, after plunking down $80 for the desktop version that I use but hate thinking about, $20 for an iPhone version I never use, I just can't bring myself to spending $40 for the iPad version without being able to figure out if I'll actually use it first (I understand this is more a criticism of the App Store rules than of OmniFocus specifically).",1280894859

But in realty what our original idea was and what we need to be are different.  it'd seem the market is not rich enough for what we want, and that we need to try another approach, even if it does abandon our original 'core idea'.  I look at it like many of the start up stories which are we started with idea X and ended with A.<p>The original idea is sound, however we cannot find a way yet to engage the user enough to make it work.  I stress yet, as we all agree there is a way, we just aren't sure the way to flip it so the user is engaged.  it is a hot topic, just a difficult one to get people to act on.<p>We keep rethinking our idea, and is just apparent that at least while we try to get the original idea some spice, we need to deviate for a while to raise money.  I understand this isn't optimal, but made need to be done.",1280894717

I have a BA in history & religious studies from UVA -- I had intentions of becoming a museum curator -- but decided to follow a career path in technology instead.  I parlayed my hobby & part time job into a Manpower temp-to-hire gig and, courtesy of a couple of tremendous bosses, was empowered to further my education on the job (trial by fire style).  Now I direct a full stack (analysis, design, dev, ops, support, administration) of ~60 great folks and love my job.  And it pays quite a bit better than $40k/yr....<p>I stopped trying to write code back around 2004.  It's not my forté.  I excel at dataset analysis & pattern recognition, and communication/soft skills.  While it does not apply so much to the startup scene and bleeding edge tech companies, the corporate world has a dearth of competent technical managers, not being technicians are hard to find, but because it tends to be a lot easier for liberal arts majors to acquire a working competency of tech knowledge than it is for hardcore geeks to learn people skills.",1280894635

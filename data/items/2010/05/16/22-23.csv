I guarantee it.<p>You ship 'm I'll teach 'm, no matter how much time it takes I'll do it. The only pre-requirements are a willingness to learn and a willingness to spend the time, as well as an iq of 80 or more.<p>Anybody can do it, not equally fast, not equally good, some may hate it and some may love it.<p>That test is so biased it's not even funny, I've linked the script below, it assumes that people will clue in to the different meaning of the '=' sign in programming (assignment) as opposed to what it means in the rest of math (equality). I note that some programmers that are very well seasoned have been caught to mess up '==' and '='.<p>I always thought that the '=' sign for assignment was a huge mistake and that '<=' would have been far better.<p>But it's a little late for that now. What galls me even more about that test is that instead of providing a warm up with a bunch of assignment samples and 'print' statements afterwards would have given the really interested parties a shot at figuring out how it works, to test their assumptions.<p>The problem with programming is an educational one, not some kind of genetic pre-disposition to being able to program.<p>Just as there are people that are better and not-so-good at arithmetic there are people that are better and not-so-good at programming.<p>It's a skill thing, and if you work at it hard enough you can get better. The ten thousand hour rule definitely applies. If that's not the case then how come there are a thousand and one books that will teach you how to become a (better) programmer. It is teachable, it is a skill, there is no magic component, in spite of what this so-called study says.<p>Here is the test script:<p><a href=""http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/test(week-0).doc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/test(week-0)...</a><p>Have read, and see what you think, try to pretend that you have no programming knowledge and that all you know is arithmetic, it basically tests a <i>single</i> question in different forms over and over again.<p>In my opinion, a much better way to grade people to find out who will be the 'good' programmers is to find who is good at solving puzzles.",1274050650

I would still interview you (there is something there for sure :)). It is a great start though; and this is how I would <i>personally</i> improve it...<p>First off the prose is a little up/down. One one hand there is a lot of Buzzword jargon and on the other you have sections like the Pornhub job - which reads like a novella. :)<p>Little asides aren't all that useful (e.g. "", fun experience"" in the CakePHP section) - it's good to be casual/funny in a CV, but not like that.<p><i>CV's should be entirely jargon free, written in the simplest of English and avoid long paragraphs</i><p>Back to the Pornhub section. No hiring manager will care how you got the job. They care about two things - what you did, and why you left. You also list a <i>lot</i> of work<p>You should keep the section fairly rigid - naming the job, employer (if possible) and a short bulleted list of:<p>- things you did<p>- responsibilities you had<p>- stuff you learned about<p>These could be technical things, or social ""teamworking"" things.<p><i>Listing Jobs on a CV is crucial - but keep them succinct and informative</i><p>Under technical skills you've  basically listed Programming languages/frameworks. There is no need to put a remark for each one. Managers will know what they all are (and if not - it's irrelevant to them) and will really be only interested in your experience with them.<p>You've also mentioned a lot of security testing in the jobs section - but no mention of that here? If you are good at it these are your most marketable skills!!<p>If I write a CV for someone I usually write the ""mundane skills"" like programming languages as a list with the length/amount of experience. Follow that up with a short prose section ""I started programming in PHP at the age of 15 and quickly progressed into other languages, picking up OOP and MVC as I went..."".<p><i>Then</i> I would deal with the marketable skills - stuff you can offer than no one else can. Either as an extended list (preferred) or prose.<p><i>In a CV you need to plug why you are an asset - knowing programming languages is only a marketable skill if you're in the upper echelons of said language :)</i><p>Education is your best section (though a little more information about classes you took might add colour).<p>What you are missing is an ""about you"" section. For me this about the most important bit; you have to sell yourself and your interests and someone who will be an asset to the company. You should explain, for example, some of your <i>relevant</i> interests (no one cares you read and swim :)). I usually talk about my interest in social networking and how people interact, my belief in privacy and how that syncs with working in the security/forensic industry.<p>Be passionate.<p>Some final tips:<p>- Bullet points on CV's are fine, I'd even say encouraged<p>- Brevity is a gift. Us poor hirers have to sift through hundreds of these a year - make it easy on us :)<p>- Formatting is only useful if your applying for a design job. Tasteful highlighting is fine but otherwise 12pt text, nicely spaced with neat headings is preferred<p>- At least once mention about working in a team and how you got on with that.<p>- Discuss your aspirations in a way that a) appears to benefit the company but b) does not compete with it and c) does not make assumptions about possible promotion/career paths at said company - e.g. ""Long term I want to become a leading expert in the field of fuzz vulnerability testing""<p>That's all I can think of now.

Politicians.  Tenured professors.  Creative solitary professions like writers, comedians, and composers.<p>The problem is that almost everyone would rather think than do, so you've got a massive supply & demand imbalance.  Everybody wants to be the one deciding what should be done; very few people want to be the ones actually doing it.<p>In practice, most professions deal with this by instituting barriers to entry.  In rigid hierarchical organizations like the corporate world, this is done through a ""pay your dues"" culture.  The people who become corporate executives get there through performing well at grunt work on an individual contributor level - well enough to attract the attention of an outgoing senior executive.  The most likely path to becoming a venture capitalist is to found a successful startup yourself.  Anyone can start a hedge fund, but convincing people to give you money usually requires a solid track record as an analyst or trader at an established firm.  Associates at management consulting firms do things like count products on store shelves and make PowerPoint presentations before they get to call the strategy shots themselves.<p>In more fluid professions like novelists, the barrier to entry is simply that you have to be so good that they can't ignore you.  There are millions of aspiring writers that want to get published; only a few thousand manage to do so, and only a few dozen become bestsellers.  If you want to be one of them, you need to be willing to practice and revise enough that your work is better than all the other folks.",1274048758

1352922,comment,1313791,1352872,0,0,jemfinch,,,"I get the distinct feeling that no matter how I respond to what you say, you'll find some way to extend the argument.  I'm not here to debate you about general issues with C++; I'm here to argue against very specific, incorrect claims you made about C++ in your initial posts.  I'm not interested in arguing with you <i>ad infinitum</i>.<p>> Now, actually using STL's <algorithm> and still end up with readable code isn't easy to me. For instance, each time `for_each` or `accumulate` would be appropriate, I end up writing a `for` loop instead, because the end result is more concise and more local.<p>This seems to be a new complaint, again unrelated to your previous complaint.  No one, least of all me, is claiming that C++ is <i>concise</i>.  If that's a debate you want to have, you'll need to find some other patsy to have it with.<p>> So in the end, container independent algorithms rarely matter to me.<p>They matter a lot to any implementer of new containers and algorithms, because they mean that any container implementer can provide iterators and automatically support a huge library of algorithms, and any algorithm implementer can automatically support a wide array of containers without needing any specific knowledge of how those containers are implemented.<p>> I think we don't use ""simple"" in the same way. Here, such an implementation of lists takes only 12 tokens and 2 lines in ML. How many do you need to do the same in C++?<p>When did this debate become about conciseness?  Your claim was not that parametric polymorphism was <i>wordy</i> in C++, it was that the implementation was ""abysmal"".  In reality, the implementation is as optimal as it really can be in an imperative, C-derived language: a non-polymorphic data structure on some type ""X"" can be made polymorphic by prepending ""template <typename T>"" before the data structure and replacing all references to ""X"" with ""T"".  That's pretty simple.<p>The difference you note in line counts for implementing a singly linked list is not because of any real difference in capability of the language to support parametric polymorphism, but in ML's support for algebraic data types as opposed to C++'s support for machine-based data types: now you're introducing yet another complaint which is not your original complaint.<p>> The real problem shows when you combine them with inheritance: you have to jump through some hoops (like having to re-declare virtual methods in the derived classes).<p>Perhaps, but since virtual methods and inheritance-based subtyping is something ML doesn't support <i>at all</i> you cannot fault C++ for its less-than-optimal support for those features in comparison to ML.<p>> But even then, we're not done. Before you do the actual lambda lifting, you have to parse the source code. Trivial in Lisp, but quite a feat in C++.<p>Introducing yet another complaint unrelated to anyone's original claims.  Ignoring it, since it's not relevant to the reason why this thread originally began.<p>> To me, such a restriction is sufficient to make function second-class citizen.<p>""First class"" is a well defined term in programming language design and implementation, and it's not the same definition you're trying to use here.  I see no point in arguing with you about your non-standard use of the term.",1274048534

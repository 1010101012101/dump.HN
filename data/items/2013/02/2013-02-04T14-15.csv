5164338,comment,5163615,5163767,5,0,saalweachter,,,"Worth noting that my understanding is that the Icelandic government never insured these deposits into Icelandic banks by foreign entities.  In the case of Great Britain, the British government decided to retroactively insure these deposits by British entities on behalf of the Icelandic banks.  The issue at hand was whether the Icelandic government should retroactively insure the banks as well, and pay the British government off.  The Icelandic government initially voted to do so, but the people said ""hell, no!"" in a referendum.<p>So in my opinion, the Icelanders didn't fail to pay a debt; they refused to incur one because the entire world has started feeling entitled to zero-risk bank deposits.  Which is quite sensible: Iceland is a tiny country, 319,000 people, and Great Britain is quite large, 62 million people.  Spreading billions of dollars of loss over Iceland's population is thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per capita.  Spreading the same loss over Great Britain's population is tens or hundreds of dollars per capita.  Iceland just can't afford to be insuring global banks, which is why the didn't and aren't.",1359989701

During this transfer you will not get a collision because it is your wire.  When all the various clients packets converge at the switch the software there will sort and buffer the traffic in a hopefully 'fair' way and then send all that traffic out a collision-free link. Repeat. (Note: old Ethernet did at one time transmit on a shared medium but most people thing of Ethernet as our modern twisted-pair-switch-n-router architecture).<p>ATM and other channel access methods[1] are solutions dealing with a different problem.  A shared medium can quite easily become overwhelmed even if everyone is playing fair.  If the link just has too many clients the network collapses.  One might liken this to the ""hotel wifi"" or ""stadium wifi"" problem.<p>While I think more open wifi is good, the technical challenges are not trivial.  Many hotels and stadiums are moving to WLAN Controller architectures coupled with highly directional APs.  Just a bit ago we saw an article on how the Super Bowl will be RF Spectrum policed this time around - just to try and keep the shared medium working.  There would be many policy questions around deploy, management, policing, etc. and many technical questions about channel access, network health, buffering, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_access_methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_access_methods</a>",1359989698

I wouldn't have batted an eye if they had named Jones, or Anquan Boldin the MVP.<p>Quite simply, it's tough bordering on impossible for a position player to match the output of a good quarterback. Even if you propose that Jones receives 100% credit for the kick return touchdown (he doesn't, the blockers deserve a fair amount), and 75% credit for the receiving TD, he didn't do much else in the game. Flacco threw two other TDs and completed 67% of his passes. Like usual he was cool and not very ""exciting."" His only really memorable pass was when he was flushed out to the right and seemingly threw it away, but hooked up with a terrific Anquan Boldin down the sideline.<p>Flacco was less exciting but more consistent and just did more.<p>I can't say for sure why he was named MVP, but he certainly deserved it.",1359989662

Theft means that the original owner no longer has the item stolen from them. Copying something from them most definitely leaves them with the original. That is one way in which piracy is not like theft. I would much rather someone download a copy of my code, than grab all my drives, make a copy, erase them, then return the drives. What you said is ""theft is wrong"" && ""piracy is wrong"" => ""Piracy must be theft"". The trouble is, you cannot apply the same concepts to physical and digital world. Once again, not arguing that pirating software or other content is good, just that it is not theft.<p>Secondly, and this is a point that I don't think is discussed much, piracy to me is an effect of market value. For example big music labels will argue that if I distribute a Britney Spears MP3 on a file sharing network, that they lose $0.99 * # of potential buyers. This is false. The market value of this piece of content is much lower. People would not pay for it if the only way to get it was through, say, iTunes.

The snippet that pulled me in was the perfect comparison to Community:<p>""Theres a saying which made its rounds in geekdom recently  Real nerds watch Community. Now I take issue with the idea of real nerds but the sentiment still stands. Whereas The Big Bang Theory sees nerd culture as an object of ridicule, Community celebrates it. Communitys laughing with you whereas Big Bang is giving you a wedgie and laughing at you. When TBBT makes a pop culture reference it uses it as a punchline, it names a show like Firefly and asks you to laugh at it. When Community makes a pop culture reference it commits. Community makes a whole episode based on a trope or a genre, it doesnt just use paintball as a plot device it takes paintball seriously and bases two season finales around epic battles of paint. Community doesnt laugh at the idea of playing D&D it bases an episode on it. Parallels can be drawn between the characters of Sheldon in Big Bang and Abed in Community. Abed too has trouble reading sarcasm and emotion, he has obsessions with routine and structure as well and disruptions in routine cause him considerable distress. Abed sees everything in terms of television and film tropes. This is how he understands the world around him and how he figures out how best to react. Unlike Sheldon, it is often confirmed that Abed does have mental difficulties, most likely Aspergers Syndrome. But, crucially, the main difference between Sheldon and Abed is that Abed is treated as a hero. In the pilot episode Jeff Winger, arguably the most conventionally cool member of the group says this: Abed is a shaman. You ask for bread and Abed gives you soup because soup is better. Abed is better. In one episode Abed is literally treated as a god. Yes, his neuroses do at times inconvenience the rest of the group but his belief that they see him as a nuisance is dismissed as his own insecurity rather than the truth. Community positions us, its audience, as Abed. It knows that we are knowledgeable about the things we love, it knows that we understand tropes and genre conventions, it gives us the benefit of the doubt and treats us as intelligent human beings who will not only understand the meta pop culture references, but will find them funny and love the show for it. Community tells us its cool to be a nerd. If Abed is better then we are better. Community is a warm hug of acceptance whereas The Big Bang Theory is a pantsing and a punch in the face.""",1359987562

But those attacks often take the easy route - someone who is Jewish will have anti-semitic rants posted about them; a woman will have graphic depictions (in text or imagery) of what people ""want to do to her""; etc.  It's fine to call a hateful attack sexist if it's using sexist tactics for the attack.<p>And it's a fact that women are more likely to be attacked than men.  This is easy (but laborious) to prove - you get a list of conferences and speakers in 2012, then ask speakers if they had any attacks, then categorise and finally run some graphing / plotting software.<p>(I didn't downvote you BTW.)",1359986685

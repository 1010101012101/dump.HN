They might have better luck talking to their friends, for example, or friends of their friends. The angel restrictions don't apply to those cases, either: it's only really official solicitations and funding rounds for which there are restrictions. If a few people get together and want to put in $10k each to a business one of their friends is starting, there is no law against that. It long predates tech startups, too; plenty of restaurants, dry-cleaners, and other traditional small businesses get their seed funding that way.",1265410779

When I first looked at the front page (on an 800px high laptop screen), I saw:<p><pre><code>  - P.C\n  - login and signup widgets\n  - a cute phrase\n  - the top two thirds of a flash block\n</code></pre>\nThe only thing above the fold that tells me what you do is the flash block. But I only got through two or three words of the first cartoon I saw before it transitioned to the next one. ""Wait, what?"" It felt a little like getting hit in the forehead with a spitball; disorienting. And I still couldn't figure out what you do until I scrolled down a bit to see the whole flash block.<p>I would put a stable blurb of text, near the top (you could shove that login/signup stuff up and to the right to free up some room) that says what you do in a nutshell.<p>The word ""resume"" does not appear anywhere on the front page until below the flash block, except within the flash block itself (see below).<p><i>The Flash Block:</i><p>Lots of your target users probably block flash. Do you want to rely on flash to present your first impression to these kinds of people?<p>The word ""resume"" or even the idea of a resume does not appear until the third slide.<p><pre><code>  - 1st slide: ""your content"" I have a lot of that.

Maybe I don't have the right youtube skills.<p><i>About Page:</i><p>Top paragraph is not bad, but the very first thing you should say is ""Praux does this and this and that for you.""

The vast majority of mobile advertising campaigns are targeted at the country level, and the user's IP address is all that's needed.  A small number are targeted to the state or designated marketing area (essentially a metropolitan region).  Mobile IP isn't perfect for those, but it's better than nothing.  In other words, this barely impacts the mobile advertising industry at all.<p>I suspect Apple will release an Advertising SDK that relies on Quattro, take 30% of the profits - less than most advertising networks take - and cut developers a single check, which will be mighty convenient.  However, Apple's not likely to enforce that developers use only their advertising SDK.  Many iPhone application developers that use advertising know that using multiple ad sources and doing some simple yield optimization performs better than a single ad source - even the most privileged ad network doesn't perform as well as multiple ad networks used in conjunction.

One might think of it as a pragmatic test by which the Federal Circuit sought almost out of desperation to bring some measure of sanity to this area.<p>It is never good news for your case, though, when the Supreme Court agrees to hear a case that first adopted a novel test that the lower court basically invented. This typically means that at least a good number of the justices are prepared potentially to reverse that decision and, if that should occur here, this will mean that there may be <i>broader</i> scope than exists today for the granting of process patents.<p>Again, the justices did not seem impressed at argument with the claims for broad patentability as asserted by the claimant in this case and they may easily rule against him, as did the Federal Circuit court. But they may choose to rule on narrow grounds that perhaps strike down the Federal Circuit test without attempting to define the rules definitively going forward (the Court often does this on the theory that an issue will continue to develop over time as it considers how best to finally deal with it).<p>It is a mistake to have raised expectations about the impact of this case in striking down process and software patents. It may happen but, if it does, that will be a surprise and not an expected outcome. In this sense, this piece is a bit over-optimistic, in my view.",1265408179

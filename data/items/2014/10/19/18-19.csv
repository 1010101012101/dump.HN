Yes, I can see reasons why someone would adopt Threefish over AES (AES predates mainstream tweakable cipher modes and, more importantly, was designed at a time when our understanding of microarchitecture side channels was crappy).<p>What I can&#x27;t see is why someone would militate for Threefish over Salsa20, or one of the eSTREAM portfolio ciphers, or at least say &quot;wait and see&quot; on CAESAR. What process happened that landed on Threefish for you?<p>Incidentally: native support for tweakability is a good thing, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t need support for &quot;weird modes of operation&quot;.

8479110,comment,8477241,8479046,0,0,zaroth,,,"I guess I see it differently. Management definitely failed to react properly once it became obvious the switch was faulty. I mean, apparently it came up in car reviews of all places.<p>However, if you&#x27;re the lead engineer on the switch, you have 23 years of experience on the job, it&#x27;s your responsibility not to say &quot;fuck it, just ship it.&quot; It&#x27;s his signature on the paperwork. This wasn&#x27;t a one-time one-day bad decision. This is a switch he worked on for <i>three years</i>.<p>The right course of action is refuse to sign off on a faulty part, and then not try to conceal that the part was faulty once people start dying. Every project has schedule pressure, so if schedule pressure is somehow a defense then engineers are never responsible. I simply don&#x27;t buy that. Management can decide they want to override the engineer and ship it anyway. GM can fire the guy for not agreeing to ship a faulty part, but then DeGiorgio could have been a whistle blower collecting 1/3rd of the damages against GM right now.<p>I don&#x27;t blame it singularly on the engineer. TFA says that GM’s Director of Product Investigations shut off the car with her knee, so this goes way beyond just the engineer. But I don&#x27;t think that lets the engineer off the hook either. The engineer failed spectacularly, possibly criminally, and I hope he has to face a jury of his peers for this.

The article already provides an excellent argument against this practice: it is inherently subjective and clearly biased.<p>I&#x27;ll add another argument: the justice system will never be perfect.  We&#x27;ll always occasionally convict innocent people.  Such people cannot be asked to be contrite about a crime they did not commit, nor does it make any sense to hold their lack of contrition against them, as we currently do.<p>I think the only fair way to do it is to base the initial sentence solely on the severity of the crime itself, and then, once the sentence is underway, to make parole decisions based solely on the prisoner&#x27;s behavior in prison.  Contrition should not factor into it.",1413743948

They basically saturated a gigabit network port from a single server, and we sent them a bill for like a gajillion dollars.  They went to another hosting company, of course, and I think got the bill down to something they managed to pay off.<p>Someone obviously had porsche-eyes, I thought it was kind of a shitty thing to do to the guys, who came to the office to make the voices of their characters for us and stuff.",1413742574

That would be bad for your business and is not credible if we exclude nepotism.<p>So, by admitting that you pay people different amounts for the same work, you are paying some people less than their genuine value to you. You are paying people unequally because of their personal circumstances.<p>Although I don&#x27;t doubt that many or most companies do this privately, I cannot see it as anything other than discrimination. The fact that you are open about this process is <i>not</i> an improvement. It&#x27;s an admission that you&#x27;re glad to have the ability to do this.<p>I found it a bit shocking that elsewhere you suggested being openly gay at work is somehow unusual - are you hiring openly gay people on the basis that they are cheaper than the market rate for the same skills? because they have fewer good options? Do you, in reality, use this justification to pay your black, gay, and female employees less than white, straight, male ones?<p>I don&#x27;t suggest that is your motivation for this (nor even that it is realised in such a small sample), but that is how I interpret your line of reasoning and I would be spend significant time talking to a lawyer if I was entering an employment relationship with you.",1413742418

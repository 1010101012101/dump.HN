1317231,comment,1316849,1317068,0,0,rbranson,,,"I read the paper. Very nice architecture. I really like the no-special-nodes aspect.<p>> Clustrix is all about concurrency and parallelism. While we didn't specifically focus on OLAP, our model allows us to do very well for these types of workloads because we break the query apart and let individual nodes work on their portion of the query.<p>I ask my original question because, in general, scaling OLAP and OLTP tend to use very different methods that work against each other. For instance, MapReduce works well for OLAP workloads, but doesn't provide the responsiveness required for OLTP (Not that it couldn't, MongoDB sure is using it for that, but it isn't the best for that). It sounds like you're applying some OLAP techniques (""broadcast"" querying and processing data at it's site) to the OLTP realm.<p>> If you had an infinitely scalable database, would you still want to put a caching layer in front of it? Most people would rather not deal with the added complexity.<p>So this system will scale to 10,000 nodes? It seems as if queries will get distributed to hundreds of nodes at this point if they are joining in several tables. I can imagine serious network contention at this point. Do you still recommend some kind of denormalization for efficiency, as it seems it would reduce the number of table slices required for a query?<p>> In a typical sharding scheme, one would choose a partition key (typically some primary key, e.g. user id) and use that as a distribution strategy. At such granularity, hot spots are a common problem. In Clustrix, we have independent distribution/partitioning for each table/index, down to the row level. To get hot spots is if you contend on a single row -- but that's really an indication of something going terribly wrong in the data model.<p>Really? What about data that is very popular? To use worn out examples, the ""real name"" field for Ashton Kutcher's Twitter feed? This is a single row of data that could quite realistically be accessed tens or hundreds of thousands of times per second at peak. I know I am picking ridiculous examples, but that's what scaling is all about :)<p>I suppose I ask about caching because, in general, caching layers only hit one box with a simple key request that have been proven to work at volumes of hundreds of thousands of queries per second (memcached at Facebook). How does this database system that hits a single node (or two, considering replica) that has to do fundamentally more work to fetch the data perform anywhere near as efficiently as a caching system?<p>> ACID (transactional properties) and KV (data model) are orthogonal concepts. Our systems scales exceptionally well and supports a wide range of data models<p>Agreed. I apologize that I wasn't clear enough here. By KV I meant Dynamo-style loosely consistent DHTs.",1272952599

There are two reasons why the shapes are different.<p>1. The bottom of the Linux graph is smaller because there are not very many primitive operations on a computer.  Data is homogenous.  There are 256 interchangeable values for a byte.  By comparison, a bacterium has to use separate pieces of machinery to handle chemicals made up of the dozens of non-interchangeable elements that it works with.  On a computer, you might use one single function for searching binary search trees all over the place in different systems, regardless of the data.  In a bacterium, when code gets copied, the copy is modified.  Every new application is a fork of some other application, welcome to a developer's nightmare (a good argument against ID... a designer would never duplicate so much code).  Developers reuse code because they can, bacteria doesn't reuse code because it can't.<p>2. The top of the Linux graph is larger because computers have to do more.  Computers get selected for features.  Bacteria get selected for survival.  The bacteria have to ""just work"", whereas people expect to be able to configure computers.  I can plug 100 different network cards into my computer, but don't expect to plug a different flagellum into a bacterium.  Maybe it's just a matter of level, if you picked a higher point in the call graph eventually you'd get to ""main"", no?",1272952231

I wouldn't go for budget headphones if you can avoid it. If you use them as much as I do getting a high quality product constructed from solid materials is worth every penny. If you compare the cost of a good pair of headphones to that of speakers on a similar level they are a bargain anyway.<p>On the cheap end the Koss PortaPro is a classic. Literally, as they have been around since 1984. If you're looking for in-ear phones Shure is getting pretty good reviews. If you're like me and don't want to spend over $1,000 on something really spectacular your best bet is comparing some reviews of products like the Sennheiser HD 650, the Beyerdynamic DT 880 and similarly priced models from AKG and Grado.<p>I'm no audiophile, so for me a large part of the decision was how the products looked and if they seemed comfortable. The construction and materials mattered to me as well. I'm clumsy and drop them on the floor a few times a day. My headphones have survived the ill treatment I've given them for several years now, so I must admit I'm pretty happy with them.<p>If you're going to buy something over $100 you should read reviews to find out what works best for the sort of things you want to listen to. Different headphones are better for different kinds of sound. The ones I use don't have the best reviews for classical music, for example. Classical music sounds pretty great on them to my untrained ear, but if that is your favorite kind of music there are better options out there.<p>Obviously, your input system matters as well. A really high-end product is a waste of money if you're going to listen to MP3's. The hardware is really important as well, so models that cost more than a few hundred dollars are probably going to cost you much more than that if you want to get an audio system that does justice to them.",1272950005

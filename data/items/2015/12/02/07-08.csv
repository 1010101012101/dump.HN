I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, a lot of interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The Dutch government also gives a huge tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.<p>The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned.They take care of you from the moment you get an offer to the point you have set up your house in Amsterdam.<p>Several people have reached out to me from these threads and have been flown to Amsterdam for interviews. Till now 2 have been given offers and more are in the middle of the interview process.<p>If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news).<p>To have an idea of the kind of problems being solved here, you can also look at our dev blog: <a href=""http://blog.booking.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.booking.com/</a><p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:<p>- Frontend developers - <a href=""http://grnh.se/cxmso8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/cxmso8</a><p>- Backend developers - <a href=""http://grnh.se/g5n6oe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/g5n6oe</a><p>- Product Owners in various departments - <a href=""http://grnh.se/edvq2n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/edvq2n</a><p>- Data scientists - <a href=""http://grnh.se/al15kt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/al15kt</a><p>- Senior Data scientists - <a href=""http://grnh.se/n4o02e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/n4o02e</a><p>- iOS Developers - <a href=""http://grnh.se/w1mi0y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/w1mi0y</a><p>- Android Developers - <a href=""http://grnh.se/1bnljt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/1bnljt</a><p>For all available positions take a look here: <a href=""http://grnh.se/3ryvfg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grnh.se/3ryvfg</a>",1449043167

Economic efficiency doesn&#x27;t align perfectly with resource or energy efficiency in an environmental sense but in this example it is still likely true.<p>There are economic and environmental costs to everyone having the tools, skills and supplies to repair a reasonable range of products.

I see &#x27;mail.google.com&#x27; then &#x27;about:blank&#x27; in the url bar, which indicates that he&#x27;s accessing a public server and then probably accessing data already on his machine.  Data that they chose to send to him and present to him within his browser with controls that were displayed to him to allow him to access it because they decided he was authorized to see it.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about weev&#x27;s case except that it sounds like it was information that AT&T had decided that the public was authorized to access without any authentication or protection.  They screwed up.  I agree that a lot of legal people are tech-illiterate, and they screw up, too.  Which may be why they eventually bailed on a venue technicality rather than address the actual case.<p>But your point was: &quot;Whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains information from any protected computer&quot; (which doesn&#x27;t really sound that dumb on its own)<p>My point is that you&#x27;re authorized to access your own computer and it isn&#x27;t protected from you, so that would not apply (unless the legals involved couldn&#x27;t figure it out).

10661577,comment,10659904,10660367,0,0,jonesb6,,,"I think this is more a flaw of the authoritarian nature of larger web frameworks. They can&#x27;t cater to every use case and have to be opinionated in certain areas.<p>In Django&#x27;s case I would say their Authentication model was an opinionated choice that has since become a major staple of Django. Many frameworks will not include default ORM-models and will instead defer to the user to implement their own authentication scheme.<p>Personally I disagree with this choice, I think database schemas have to be flexible and an in-framework authentication setup will only encourage users to lean more on the framework even when it is working against them. I&#x27;ve burned plenty of hours in Django trying to work / extend the authentication model. While I have no doubt much of this was due to my inexperience with Django, there is a certain responsibility with having a framework used by many beginners who will struggle and perhaps pick up bad habits (like expecting your web framework to automagically solve everything) if you do not design it for them.<p>Overall I think Django is awesome. But it&#x27;s not for every use-case, or every developer.

Then things like the NSA leaks happen, and other questionable Google changes, and I&#x27;m sorry, but I lost that trust. I use as little closed-source stuff as possible now.<p>I&#x27;m sure it is frustrating, but you&#x27;d have to thank the people in charge for that distrust. I wasn&#x27;t born with it, the cloud-providers earned it. I used to think this was tin-hat territory myself.<p>IMO, the solution is to stop storing things in the cloud, and start giving me the tools to do it myself. I have no idea how to work that out financially. If google made a &quot;maps app&quot; that was open-source and I could run on my own server, but charged for it, I would probably buy that because I like the service so much. But as it stands, I try to avoid using it as much as possible, because I simply <i>can&#x27;t</i> trust Google.<p>EDIT: Forgot to answer this<p>> if the primary effect of the conspiracy theorists is to throw bricks at the people who are trying really hard to make sure the bad things never happen, then which side are the conspiracy theorists really on?<p>At the end of the day, Google just doesn&#x27;t do enough to make me think that they are &quot;making sure the bad things never happen&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of people who are trying hard to make that true, but how can I know that is true for everyone? What can you offer me other than root access to your servers? I&#x27;d honestly like a good answer to this, because I just don&#x27;t have one.<p>And the amount of data/power that Google has is just too much for me to think that they won&#x27;t &quot;get greedy&quot; some day. If up until today, Google was a good company and wasn&#x27;t abusing anything in any way, and suddenly tomorrow they turned evil, why would they erase my data first? They still have it, and I have no control over whether or not Tomorrow-Google will keep it.<p>> ...then which side are the conspiracy theorists really on?<p>The side of trying to validate whether or not things are as they say on face-value. Whether thats Google&#x27;s side or not is up to them.",1449042169

Conserved quantities prevent states differing in at least one conserved quantity from ever evolving into the same state, i.e. conserved quantities partition the phase space and states cannot cross those partition boundaries. This also has to hold for all isolated subsystems. And conserved quantities arise from symmetries like homogeneity and isotropy of space which are pretty solid empirical and experimental facts. It&#x27;s all interlinked and I imagine it would not be to easy to eliminate time reversibility from the laws of physics without causing some odd consequences.",1449042111

I feel that people are very encline to share when they&#x27;re listened to. Once the valve is open, the flow does not stop :) John for instance kept talking for 45min without me asking any questions.<p>You have a point though: people need to have references in terms of questions to be able to do interviews on their own. I will think about how to integrate this in the site. Thanks for the idea and for the red5, I will look into it.<p>Robin",1416463089

8634602,comment,8634037,8634141,0,0,shostack,,,"This is the root of my concern with where Facebook and Google are heading.<p>In the email world, you invested in building your house list, and it was likely your most valuable marketing asset.<p>You...<p>-- Controlled it<p>-- Could associate whatever data with it you had access to<p>-- You could (pending deliverability) communicate with them as frequently as you wanted for a fixed/variable rate depending on what your send costs were.  For most ESPs (email service providers) there is typically a fixed platform fee, and a variable volume fee<p>-- Most importantly, your costs to message to your acquired audience was relatively fixed which helped balance the variable cost of acquiring them<p>With Facebook, they abused the trust marketers put into them.  From day one the conversation was about building your brand&#x27;s presence on Facebook  with the &quot;understanding&quot; you would more or less be able to communicate with your audience freely once you invested in building the list.<p>I put &quot;understanding&quot; in quotes because there was of course nothing ever spelled out...but that was literally how it worked at the time, so it became understood to be how it worked.<p>The reality of what Facebook has done and where they are going has changed that relationship...<p>-- They want you to invest a variable (and likely ever increasing) cost to build your list within Facebook<p>-- They own the majority of the data on that list and their targeting tools are essentially you renting that information from them<p>-- They own your list, and want to charge you a variable cost via a black box algorithm to reach said list at the scale/frequency you desire<p>It is this last part that is the biggest issue.  Email was a space where marketers had control over their ability to reach their opt-in audience, not the platform or network.  But fixed-price models are not always as profitable as variable priced models run through a black box.<p>My broader fear is that Google has come to the same conclusion, and Inbox (and the tabs before that) is the first manifestation that Google is working on a serious monetization play for email beyond the horrid Gmail placements in AdSense and whatever targeting data they may be able to indirectly monetize.<p>He who owns the ability to reach that contact list has a company by the balls.  End of story.  Once you have that, why charge them a fixed rate when you can maximize profit by tweaking whatever variables you want whenever it suits you with regards to the costs (ie. the auction model)?<p>It remains to be seen if Google is going down that path, but it is clear Facebook already has.  There is still hope for off-site ads with them for advertisers who know how to measure it from a conversion standpoint, and more importantly, a cross-channel attribution perspective.  Social tends to be more of an awareness/upper-funnel driver when you can see the birds-eye attribution picture, with some exceptions like mobile app installs that see success from a direct response standpoint.<p>Smart marketers will likely focus on owning their audience data to market to them as much on their terms and a predictable cost structure as possible.  Their continued ability to do so may be largely out of their control however if the companies who own the ability to reach their &quot;list&quot; have visions of being more than a basic fixed-price conduit.",1416462893

8634599,comment,8632043,8632043,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"We don&#x27;t have fully async computers. Something <i>somewhere</i> will block, be it in the CPU, fetching blocks from a disk, kernel context switches, etc. You will hit fundamental limits. Heck, I&#x27;ve hit network card limits before and was none the wiser. There is actually a really good question you can ask yourself when designing a system: do you want it to go very fast at times, or do you want it to have very predictable speed? I learned to choose the latter: better fire up 16 processes and delegate work to them from a master process than to fire up one async loop that <i>may</i> get bogged down at some point.<p>At the same time, having a good mental model of what your code is waiting on or is blocked by is very important. Years ago I read advice on building multi-threaded systems. It went something like &quot;when asked what&#x27;s the hardest thing about coding up multi-threaded systems, beginners say things like deadlocks, but real pros say &#x27;avoiding doing nothing&#x27;&quot;. So if your application does some large bit of work and in the middle of it it&#x27;s blocked, why not go do something else.<p>Here&#x27;s the hitch, and what the article alludes to: a system where you have 16 worker processes and they are either handling a client request or are waiting, your max users is 16. That&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s a hard limit. By design you can&#x27;t process 17 requests at once. If you however go with an async system, let&#x27;s say based on Node.js, you don&#x27;t have this control. You have a crude &quot;how many connections can we accept&quot; thing, but you generally can&#x27;t introduce limits you can actually reason about. If you simply set your max connections wide open, and then connect it all to MongoDB, you&#x27;ll quickly find that MongoDB has a global write lock that will start rearing its ugly head. You can&#x27;t overcome this limit, but you also don&#x27;t know where this limit is. Systems with set internal limits that propagate back pressure to the edge, on the other hand, have very predictable behavior.",1416462817

8634596,comment,8634018,8634301,0,0,AaronFriel,,,"No, because the quasars weren&#x27;t aligned with each other globally (cosmologically), it appears they are aligned with whatever structure they are embedded in at large scales. I think the term is a filament, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>If every quasar wherever we looked was aligned such that their axes of rotation were parallal, that would be a huge blow to the cosmological principal. Or more spookily, suppose all of the quasars studied were oriented with their poles lining up to some point in the universe. A good hint that some God created the universe for us, for example, would be for every single quasar&#x27;s axis of rotation to be pointing at the earth.<p>But those things do not seem to be the case, and the cosmological principal appears to hold. Look at any corner of the universe, and quasars point in an arbitrary direction. Look at another corner, and they point in a different arbitrary direction. Zoom out, and now there is no cohesive direction. Homogeneity is preserved at scales much smaller than the largest structures we&#x27;ve observed, because the chains of quasars are themselves much smaller than the filaments and other super-structures that snake through the observable universe.",1416462767

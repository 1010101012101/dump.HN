9291307,comment,9287115,9287115,0,0,joeld42,,,"&quot;I quickly wrote the screenplay for a pilot episode. I think that it came out quite good&quot;<p>Not trying to be a jerk here, but unless you&#x27;re a seasoned tv writer (and if you were, you wouldn&#x27;t be asking this), it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that something you dashed off quickly turned out that well. Maybe it is good, but to get produced it needs to be great. Have you read the Game of Thrones pilot script? That was pretty good, and without an option or a name writer attached it has to be better than that.<p>Also, you did this in the wrong order. You get the option first, then you write the pilot, unless it&#x27;s a pure spec not intended to be produced, e.g. written just as a writing sample to get a staff job.<p>Almost every writer and showrunner in hollywood has a &quot;passion project&quot; like this that they would love to get made one day. And just as often, they can&#x27;t do it even with a few shows under their belt and tons of connections.<p>Not sure why you&#x27;re asking this on a startup news site. If you want, put on your flame-resistant armour and ask this again at in the forums at donedealpro.com. Post some sample pages there for critique. You&#x27;ll get a lot of flak, and there&#x27;s a lot of trolls on there, but you&#x27;ll also get some good advice from people working in the industry.<p>All of that said, I hope you prove me wrong. You&#x27;re right about one thing, it is a great series and would be a perfect fit for TV (well, except for budget, some of those settings would be unfilmable due to expense).<p>If you want, email me 5-10 pages from your pilot and I&#x27;ll be happy to give you honest, constructive notes.",1427738395

All the FED did to &#x27;improve the economy&#x27; through its actions is drive up the stock market, create opportunities for malinvestments (e.g. the shale oil industry that is now about to collapse because of lower oil prices), and drive other central banks around the world to do the same to avoid their currencies decoupling too much from the value of the dollar. Things don&#x27;t look too bad right now because most of the rest of the world (except Japan) is basically about a year behind the curve compared to the US, and we the next powder keg hasn&#x27;t exploded yet, but the fuse has been lit, and it&#x27;s just a matter of time until Bernanke will have to eat his words and all the asset bubbles the Fed created under his supervision explode in the faces of all these retirees he was supposedly so concerned about...<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying Bernanke had easy and/or painless other policy options, or that central banks would even have the ability to fix the global economy and monetary system by the way.

Under inflation, the opposite is true: I pay back a loan with dollars that are less valuable than the dollars I borrowed.<p>If you go beyond the individual prospective debtor and consider larger entities like banks and businesses, the potential economic effects of deflation appear more serious.<p>To add to this: under continued deflation, wages would have to fall to compensate. But, as Krugman and others have pointed out, nominal wages resist downward pressure[1], which means that instead of lower wages, you get layoffs.

They allege an agent just basically strong armed some random guy (&quot;RP&quot;) who was a customer of CoinMKT and stole $297,000 or so from him, using the Federal Government search and seizure docs to do so but then just transferring the money into his personal checking account.<p>The agent was doing shady transactions via Venmo and got flagged and had his account suspended, so he contacted them as a DEA agent to get the account reinstated.

They had a tendency not to die at the rate that natives and immigrants did. We know that on northern canal projects... thousands of immigrants and natives might die in a single season from malaria... but blacks didn&#x27;t seem too affected at all by these sorts of environments. (Look it up... even with the Erie canal, which was really well run medically speaking, 1,000 men could die every season from malaria. The southern canals didn&#x27;t suffer these kinds of casualties. Why?) Well today, of course, we KNOW about the sickle cell and how it helps a human with respect to malaria. But put yourself in the shoes of a camp doctor in the 17th, 18th or 19th centuries... I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the survival rate of the blacks would have seemed nothing short of miraculous to you.<p>This is the, not so politically correct, reason that blacks were doomed to slavery. They didn&#x27;t die doing work that most other people DID die doing. This is WHY they were more economical. Immigrants would never have been able to complete the canals that the slaves completed in the South. Because, since it was the South, the mosquito problem would have been even more acute. The death rate even higher. And on top of all of that... the geography was agitating against them. It would have been a catastrophe to even attempt those canals with immigrants or natives.<p>Not to sound racist or anything... but that&#x27;s the whole reason we HAD the blacks. To put it all into dollars and cents... S-O-A was going to be about 60 some odd miles long and cost just $500,000. And the geography was actually FAR tougher to build a canal on than the geography along the Erie. By comparison the Erie was 5 or 6 times longer... but cost 14 TIMES as much. Largely down to the use of waged labor that died easily. If they had used blacks... even if they paid them the same wages... due to the difference in death rate... the cost would have been only 9 to 11 times that of the S-O-A. If they had used slaves... it would have been cheaper per mile than the S-O-A.<p>These financial realities did not go unnoticed by northern elites. And the animosities these realities created exploded into civil war eventually.",1427737997

Privacy is a selling point, especially nowadays.<p>My guess is that the proposal probably included the cliche &quot;win/win situation,&quot; had already been sitting in someone&#x27;s back pocket, and the raising of it was either sparked by some privacy-related news story -or- a market event of some kind. At the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>I think there are a handful of techs that lend themselves to natural monopoly--basically anything where the expense of building sufficient infrastructure for a minimally-competitive product requires previous success in the market. This is true whether the infrastructure is copper lines or a body of previous searches.<p>That means you&#x27;re either one of the first ones there with low cost of entry and building on your own successes (Google); or you&#x27;re shifting to the market from success in an unrelated area (Bing); or you&#x27;re essentially locked out unless you can somehow acquire access to that infrastructure.<p>My guess is search will eventually turn into an antitrust-regulated industry. Really depends on whether up and comers like DuckDuckGo can really stay relevant based on ideology and whether old players like Yahoo can really re-enter the market successfully.<p>But the most likely scenario really appears to be a duopoly between Google and Bing at best, and more likely simply a monopoly for Google.<p>The analogous solution to telecom would be forced access to search queries for alternative providers (a la CLEC/ILEC) but privacy concerns will make the situation interesting to say the least.<p>Possible it may eventually turn out that mainstream search engines simply have no specific privacy protection, at least for aggregate data. Since that&#x27;s in both the corporations&#x27; (market leaders aside) and government&#x27;s best interest, seems plausible. That&#x27;d be a lot of power behind it.",1427737588

9291044,comment,9289205,9289205,0,0,stevenh,,,"I feel Google goes above and beyond to financially compensate content creators, at least as far as YouTube is concerned. Google even automatically detects duplicated content in other people&#x27;s YouTube videos so that true creators can monetize stolen copies of their own work on the same platform if they choose.<p>In contrast, freebooting on Facebook is becoming an enormous problem. Facebook has a ton of hidden throttles in place which prevent external links such as YouTube from going viral; they automatically favor stolen reuploaded copies instead. Those who help Facebook to profit from this theft are rewarded with more exposure and more likes.<p>Silent victims are being robbed en masse like this by Facebook on a daily basis, and many will never realize it.<p>A recent depressing example I noticed was a video by a woman named Leslie Hall, whose entire combined view count for all of her copyrighted YouTube videos over the past nine years was around 12 million. It seems like she&#x27;s poured a lot of money and effort into trying to get attention with her strange videos. Nothing ever really caught on, until finally one of her videos exploded in popularity, receiving over 16 million views in just one week - more views than all of her life&#x27;s work on YouTube had ever received. Unfortunately, it was a freebooted copy on Facebook which did not even bother to include her name anywhere. People interested in seeing more of her work were unable to do so, unless they went the extra mile and performed a google search for the chorus. That&#x27;s how I found her, so I emailed her to let her know she might want to send a DMCA takedown notice or something. She was extremely upset about the situation.<p>The same problem applies to other content theft rackets like 9gag, funnyjunk, imgur, etc. All of these companies have made millions of dollars by stealing other people&#x27;s work and hiding behind the false claim that it&#x27;s &quot;too much work&quot; to put honest effort into finding and redirecting to the true creator of anything that goes viral on their own site. Creators of webcomics are perhaps the biggest victims there. I&#x27;ve contacted comic creators in the past when I noticed their stolen comic going viral on one of these sites, and many have said they were silently furious any time it happened.<p>I believe these sites should be legally required to implement something like what Google does with YouTube, even if it&#x27;s just a low-tech solution involving a single employee who sits there manually performing reverse image searches all day. As it stands, none of these companies are any more ethical than Kim Dotcom&#x27;s Megaupload; the only difference is that the victims are small, scattered, and don&#x27;t have hundreds of millions of dollars available to spend on bending law enforcement to their will to punish these sites that steal from them.",1427736591

Six years and two additional rounds of QE later, interest rates and inflation in the U.S. are still quite low.<p>People tend to forget that the economy has done quite well even under inflation levels that we&#x27;d now consider high; during the Reagan boom, inflation fluctuated between 3-5%.  Even if all this QE led to 5% inflation for a number of years, that&#x27;s not really a serious problem (and certainly not hyperinflation).<p>It starts to get painful when you get to 10%, 15%, 20%, but that&#x27;s a fixable problem. Indeed, it was fixed at the end of the 1970s. It was painful, but it was fixed.<p>So, yes, it might catch up with us. But when and how badly matter a lot. If the cost of all this QE is that average inflation in the 2020s is 5%, so what? That&#x27;s hardly a disaster.  Or let&#x27;s say inflation creeps up to about 12%, and in 2025 the Fed takes strong action to get it under control, leading to a sharp painful recession in 2025-26.

Maybe, on a particular topic, you want to read a chatty, informal explanation, and then you&#x27;ll want something heavily summarized to nail things in place. Then you might want something really rigorous if you need to go into a lot of detail. Or it might be useful to have a text that scatters explanation of the concepts in amongst the steps to solve practical examples. All of these approaches have value.<p>When I was learning Maths and Physics one of the major conclusions was that there was not enough variety in the material which was available, so when you hit a brick wall, part of the skill was developing an acceptance that you would hit your head against the wall repeatedly until something sank in.

For example, decimal addresses and arbitrary wordlengths are bad for C.<p>The Fortran compiler is 63 phases (not passes). Each phase contains an average of 150 instructions and a maximum of 300 instructions. Can you imagine that? Breaking a compiler into chunks of 300 instructions?<p>My favorite phase is #8: &quot;Squoze&quot;, which squeezes out type-defining words to free up more space.

9290848,comment,9289612,9289612,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Consider the simple aggregate production function: Q = zF(L,K) where Q is output, z is the level of technology, known as Total Factor Productivity (TFP), L is labor, and K is capital.<p>Sustainable economic growth is driven by increases in z, TFP which drives the production function. Government investment in education, R&D, healthcare, and infrastructure increase TFP. There is a serious lack of gov&#x27;t investment in these areas. In my opinion the share of capital (K) in the equation has grown far beyond what is healthy. Solow posits that capital attracts capital [0]. We have not done enough to offset this natural tendency, and we are seeing the result - huge and constantly growing wealth & income inequality.<p>The economy is growing in an unsustainable fashion. There is a serious lack of &quot;good&quot;, sustainable investments in the global economy. One example of this is investor&#x27;s willingness to pay the Swiss central bank to hold their money for them. Investors are scared - they know a serious revision in value is bound to occur.<p>Many parts of the EU are beginning to flirt with deflation. The top comment mentions negative prime interest rates in Sweden that have not affected the standard of living. This is very interesting given the traditional viewpoint that any form of deflation, however minor, is an economic calamity. Maybe for the central banks it is, as they lose control of one their control over the setting of short term interest which has been their prime monetary policy weapon over choice over the past 30 years.<p>Whatever happens, this is an interesting situation that I&#x27;m sure will inform generations to come.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model</a>",1427734861

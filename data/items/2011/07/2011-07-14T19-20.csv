2764782,comment,2763575,2764555,2,0,andreaPG,,,"flietz, nice points but a bit facetious. Of course I only wrote the post because CA's law and Amazon's response directly affect our site. I might have thought it but not taken the time to write it if it wasn't so personal.<p>Amazon is a net good, I think. It's made products from anywhere available to anywhere readily, reliably and cheaply. It also had created a wonderful ecosystem for small businesses. This is why we chose to affiliate our site with Amazon.<p>That said, there's no question that Amazon's success further decimated / continues to decimate small independent booksellers and other retailers who contributed more readily to regional economies - creating local jobs, supporting local events, paying local sales tax, etc.<p>Your local consumer may have more money for local coffee if she doesn't pay sales tax, but her local government has less. Beyond that, her local economy has less from any profit on the TV going into circulation in Washington State rather than staying with a locally-owned business.<p>That said, I value Amazon's right to compete with local businesses, and the value and innovation their success brings to me, my city, our nation, and the world at large.<p>Whether or not you agree with sales tax is one question - the one addressed by your points above. But if it exists for some, how is it fair for it not to exist for all?<p>(The argument that the consumer is expected to pay it either way is not a valid point - the reality is the consumer is escaping it with one retailer and coughing it up at another.)",1310673514

Maybe this is a bad assumption - but most people have common applications on a page or in a folder. Remembering home screens should make it easier to access other applications that are USUALLY used with the current one.<p>For example, I group all my work (let's say .doc, .xlsm, .ppt) into one folder. When I exit or alt tab, should it switch to the last thing I was on, or should it go to my desktop?<p>You only need to hit Home once anyway and the bit about the double tap is a little silly.

2764751,comment,2764130,2764565,2,0,ned_roberts,,,"Sorry, I should have explained more.<p>You're correct, you can bind keyboard shortcuts to most actions in Xcode. The problem is that the UI seems to have been built with the mouse in mind, with keyboard navigation as an afterthought. Is it really all that useful that I can pull up a dropdown menu with a shortcut if I still have to arrow up/down to pick my file? AppCode allows me to pull up a list of recent files with a shortcut and has the last file edited as the top option. This allows me to quickly switch between two files. In Xcode I can pull up the recent files menu, but it's not ordered in terms of recent usage, so I'm constantly having to find my place in it.<p>And there are some functions I couldn't find a way to bind. Can I bind a key to 'jump to definition'? Or how about 'find usages' or 'rename variable'? I tried to make Xcode work for me, but I just felt like I was having to fight against how Apple wanted me to use it.<p>It could be that coming from the Java world and using IDEA I was just more used to the default shortcuts.

However, you can't beat hardware buttons and controls when used correctly.  The iPhone should have several buttons.  Gamers would LOVE this.  It should also have a scroll-wheel on the side.  I've had several devices with scroll-wheels, most notably blackberry phones.  I happen to think that they are fantastic.  Need to scroll through your contacts?  You can do it with ONE hand.  Use your thumb to scroll and click the  scroll-wheel button to select.<p>Touch is neat, but it is also a PITA.  Typing on iPhone or iPad is decidedly decades backwards with respect to hard-button keyboards.  In addition to this, if you regularly communicate in multiple languages it is impossible to use the auto-completion feature and, therefore, you are relegated to making horrible spelling mistakes.<p>I like the devices for what they've done to push tech forward but it'd be nice to see Apple put out a new iPhone with something like a clamshell design and a real keyboard along with some multi-function buttons.

You're not your f'ing open source project.<p>I don't espouse the negativity in Fight Club, but the quote that I've adapted seems particularly relevant here.<p>""Facebook users 'are insecure, narcissistic and have low self-esteem'""
<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1310230/Facebook-users-narcissistic-insecure-low-self-esteem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1310230/Faceb...</a><p>I consider Github sort of the developer equivalent of Facebook. Let me clarify that. If you're posting stuff on Github just to impress recruiters and fellow engineers, then it is. If you're using it in a constructive way, less so or maybe not at all. The point I'm trying to make is that there are parallels between the two.<p>Look. It's good to provide recruiters (by recruiter I mean a real engineer here who is evaluating candidates) evidence that you're skilled. There are many ways to do that. One way would be to bring in code and discuss it. Another way would be to work through programming problems in the recruiter's presence. I'm not talking about ""a-ha"" brain teasers but real, actual programming. After all, that's what a programmer is (theoretically) being hired to do.<p>But please do not encourage an arms race where programmers fall over each other trying to see how much code they can post publicly, and how much work they can give away.<p>I'm highly skilled and my time is precious. I don't spend it looking in front of the (Github) mirror, and I actually charge money for it. Charity is a good thing, but you shouldn't do it to boost your ego and image. And further, if that's all you spend your time doing, I would wonder why you want to work in private industry where the purpose is to make money so we can be employed. You know, engineers at Apple might not have Github accounts, but they are employed and support their families. Apple's work also lifts tons of people out of poverty in China. How many people does your open source project feed?<p>You guys need to step off the ego train and direct your energy into stuff that actually matters. And you will be happier for it.",1310672862

Resetting the ""desktop"" to the ""home screen"" state is not a more logical path.  It might or might not be a better choice, but it's not more logical, and it certainly wouldn't fit their guidelines any better.<p>As for the ""one path"" argument, making the button take you directly to the home screen doesn't reduce the number of paths.  You exit the app via the home button and it takes you to one place.  That's one path.  Whether the path is to the home screen or back to the state you were in is a design choice that has no effect on the number of paths.<p>Personally, I think Apple made the right choice.  It would be pretty obnoxious to be on screen 3, launch the wrong app on accident, and then be dumped back to screen 1 when exiting.  I'd much rather be able to hit the home button and then immediately launch the app I intended to launch.",1310672859

You will have a lot of people who live in average places and have average salaries entering in their information, and any information generated from data is going to be representative, and reveal something about average salaries in average places. Then you might get a whole bunch of people in expensive places entering in their large salaries, and any information generated from that data will reflect that.<p>Then you will have a smaller number of people living out in the country, entering in their low salaries. Now there aren't too many of them so the affect they have on the statistics is proportional to their number.<p>Basically, you will end up with a number like 70k as an average salary. And that means something. It means the average developer, wherever he may live, earns about 70k. Sure people in expensive places earn more than that on average, people in cheaper places earn less. But that is obvious, each person in each place entered their salary and they all counted towards the average.<p>Now if everyone decided to try and correct away location, whatever that means, and scaled their salaries up to some arbitrarily expensive city, you might end up with a value like 120k, when in fact a vast majority of people are earning less than that. How is that representative? How is that useful or meaningful?

It brings up iOS's multitask tray that has the four previously viewed apps on it, in order of recent use. The first app on it is always the previous app. You can see which one it is. Android doesn't show this to you, nor do you even have the option of getting to the previous app unless you are at the bottom of the stack.<p>Edit: We're arguing about the merits of having a dedicated back button. If an advantage to the iOS task switching feature is found in yet another button on Android, that doesn't contribute support to the back button's existence.",1310671427

2764552,comment,2763502,2764332,7,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"Android has both a home and a back button.<p>The inconsistency you talk about only happens when authors poorly create their applications. Android's entire multitasking functionality is built on top of a stack of activities, which is easiest to think of as a stack of screen views. I start at my ""desktop"", click on my Photo Gallery, decide to share an image using Dropbox, and it takes me to choosing a Dropbox folder. That's roughly three activities or so (depending on how many screens within each app I have to go through) all on a stack. Built properly, if I decide I don't want to share on Dropbox while choosing a folder, I would just hit the back button, it'd pop the Dropbox folder browsing screen off the stack, and take me back to browsing my Photo Gallery. Poorly-created apps will try and ""recreate"" their internal activity stack when they're not supposed to. Let's say that getting to Dropbox's folder browser if I were to launch the app independently took four activities in and of itself. If Dropbox was poorly written, it would try and recreate that natural flow of previous activities when you're just trying to do a share, so hitting the back button won't take you to the Photo Gallery from sharing.<p>Sorry, it's complicated to explain but makes perfect sense when you're actually using a device. The tl;dr is that if app developers don't suck the back button's behavior is seamless and consistent.",1310670856

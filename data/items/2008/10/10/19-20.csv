The title the editor picks is chosen to fill up the amount of empty space available, usually after reading only the first couple paragraphs. If the title doesn't reflect what makes the story interesting or compelling, then by all means change it. This is especially true for sources like Wired that like to pick some cutesy title that has nothing to do with the article; in these cases just grab the bold text or the topic sentence and use that as either a title or subtitle.",1223667994

329172,comment,328841,329029,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>For both problems you cite, the worst case scenario comes down to the situation without that law, right? A startup that has X and Z but not Y, will be no worse with the new law than without it. And if the ""new administrative burden"" wasn't worth it, startups could ignore it and pay their taxes.</i><p>Actually, the worst case might be that the law favors some ""startup"" companies over others.  Already, my three person startup has higher regulatory burden, relatively speaking, when it comes to taxes and payroll processing and such, than a much larger company (who can amortize their team of accountants across tens of thousands of employees).  Of course, I'm not saying that it's a showstopper, or that dealing with taxes and payroll is going to kill us or keep us from competing.  But, if there were a law that defined my biggest competitor as a ""startup"" and my company as a non-""startup"", and as a result they got free money that I don't have...it warps the competitive landscape.<p>How big of a difference can this make?  I dunno.  We don't know the definition or the specifics of what the plan entails.  But, for an example of what seemingly subtle favoritism can do, you need look no further than the US broadband market.  I'm intimately familiar with this, as my first startup was entirely a business built on selling to independent ISPs (though it had to evolve for reasons that'll be obvious).  There were thousands of them in the US ten years ago.  Broadband came along, and while everyone agreed that there needed to be some way for competition to happen in the broadband space, it took a <i>long</i> time to come to an agreement on how the line access would be sold (because good ol' AT&T owns pretty much every phone line in the country, and local cable companies own the other option, and those folks, particularly AT&T, know how to buy a congressman).  In the end the terms that were reached guaranteed that AT&T and the cable companies could offer broadband cheaper than their competitors that had to rent the lines (while, of course, making it clear to their regulatory overseers that the cost efficiencies that allowed them to sell broadband cheaper than all of their competitors were to be found in places <i>other</i> than the lines).  The laws that were intended to allow competition to flourish was merely a subtle death warrant for every independent ISP in the country.  There are now a tiny handful of alternative DSL providers that squeak by providing business class services and other premiums.  Killed by small differences in the competitive landscape.  Would it be so dramatic?  No, probably not.  But it can make a difference, and it has made a difference many times in history.  There's a reason why the biggest companies in the US have teams of lobbyists working constantly for little favors.  Laws that give established players just one more tiny leg up over their competitors.<p>I don't think that Obama's ""startup"" tax incentives would be any different.  He is, after all, a big supporter of corn...aint nothing but lobbyist money driving that machine forward.<p>That's not to say I don't wish that small startups <i>could</i> avoid some of the regulatory and tax burden that is somewhat heavier on smaller companies.  My first startup was definitely slowed down a few times when I got to the end of a quarter and realized I owed Uncle Sam twenty grand (the previous business wasn't very steady...some months were fantastic, some were awful, and taxes would sneak up at the exact wrong time: when things were going well and I needed the cash on hand to keep the good times rolling).",1223667244

329153,comment,328632,329031,0,0,mdasen,,,"A lot of people have grand theories of how their government is hurting them by things like this.  Most of it is just bunk because it just swaps ends.<p>For example: a strong Euro makes European exports expensive.  However, a strong Euro makes it cheap to import things.  So, VW has a hard time exporting Jettas, but they have an easy time importing the parts they need to make Jettas.<p>It's also one of those situations where that increased demand for Euros would eventually need to be spent.  Lots of foreigners put their money in Euros raising the price of Euros, but eventually they'll want to spend it and if their buying power is higher in the US or other non-Eurozone places, they'll dump the Euros for that currency which lessens the demand for Euros.<p>Economics tends toward equilibriums. Lots of things push it out of equilibrium, but not over the long-term.<p>The one thing that higher interest rates tend to do is discourage investment.  The profits of non-financial firms doesn't depend on interest rates and I think it's safe to assume that the average firm sees about 10% growth per annum.  So, if you (as an investor) can get a guaranteed 6% from a bank or a potentially risky 10% in stocks, stocks look less attractive than when your bank is giving you 2% interest.  The reward for the risk of stocks diminishes as interest rates are higher.<p>Likewise, on the loan end, higher interest rates make it less attractive for businesses (or individuals) to borrow money to start a company or buy a house since it diminishes their potential profit and makes it riskier that they will even achieve a profit since their costs are higher.<p>That's not to say raising interest rates is a bad thing in all cases - in fact, during boom times you want to do that in order to manage the economic growth.  But when faced with an economic crisis, it's good to get the money flowing more freely (by having lower interest rates).",1223666006

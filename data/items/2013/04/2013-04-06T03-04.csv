At this point in my career, I would never accept a freelance gig like the one you described, because I know how that goes.<p>You don't <i>need</i> to try other languages, do it only if you want to. If you wanna save time just take my word, Symfony2 has nothing to envy to Django or Rails (I have used them and also digged into their architecture).

For example, Ruby/Rails is the same as PHP/Symfony2, you won't learn much. I jumped into Rails and just started coding, because I already knew web development, I wasn't impressed, the differences were mostly syntactic sugar, monolithic vs decoupled, and issues like the lack of interfaces and type hinting. But Clojure? Mind blown. I'm gonna spend my next summer learning more Clojure, because I already know it's my perfect language, but it's hard and full of new concepts. Meanwhile, php/Symfony2/nginx is my perfect stack for web development.",1365220640

5502571,comment,5498367,5501578,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"This is an interesting analogy. Let's see where it goes. So we've got this vending machine. Suppose the door is broken; it won't close. As a result, if you insert money, the machine credits you with having paid but the money falls out onto the floor instead of being held securely inside the machine.<p>So, can we justify having a law against ""unauthorized access to a vending machine""? Let's see what we get based on what someone does.<p>Scenario A: Defendant takes a soda without paying for it. Defendant is going to argue that this isn't unauthorized access; maybe the prosecutor can argue that it is, but that doesn't even matter. What you're doing is stealing. That's what you should be prosecuted for. There is no call for a law against ""unauthorized access"" in order to prosecute in this case, what is needed is a law against taking what isn't yours. This scenario occurs in any case for which ""unauthorized access"" occurs in furtherance of anything which is actually wrong -- the wrong thing should already be illegal and have appropriate penalties for that conduct so there is no benefit in such cases of a separate prohibition on unauthorized access.<p>Scenario B: You want a soda but the machine won't take your money because the door won't close. So you open up the machine, put a $5 bill in the cash store and take your change and your soda. Here you aren't stealing anything; you've paid the asking price. Great, we've discovered a scenario where the prohibition on unauthorized access actually does something instead of being totally redundant -- you're not authorized to open up the vending machine, so even though you didn't steal anything or do anything to harm anyone, you still accessed it without authorization. So is this the scenario where we want to impose criminal liability? I don't think so. A law prohibiting that conduct is rubbish. You want laws to prohibit doing bad things, not to prohibit doing good things that are unanticipated.",1365220578

5502563,comment,5500095,5500400,5,0,kannanvijayan,,,"The Baseline JIT will have more of an impact on common web code than highly optimized JITs like Ion.  Most web code executes for a few iterations, and runs for short periods of time.  Baseline takes over from the interpreter far sooner than either Jaeger or Ion, and compiles far faster than either of them.  Much more common web code will end up getting executed under the baseline jit than with the existing jits.<p>I disagree with your sentiment that it does not make a difference in the real world.  The real world is changing.  The web now runs on devices which span an order of magnitude in processing power (from low end phones, to high-end workstations).  Fast javascript has only been around for a few years or so.  Ubiquitous connectivity (everybody connected to the internet all the time) has only just started happening.  And full-fledged APIs to make the web a robust development platform (e.g. WebAudio, WebRTC, WebGL, etc.) have only recently come on the scene, or are still being solidified.  I think we have yet to see the full potential of all of these technologies tapped.<p>In a previous life I worked in bioinformatics, and worked on a web-application to allow scientists to invoke and visualize the results of analyses on their tissue samples.  Web 2.0 was all the rage back in those days, and V8's optimized JS engine was announced AFTER we developed most of our app.  If we had been able to assume that kind of performance at the beginning, our app would have pushed much more of the UI to the frontend.  Instead of clunky static server-generated images, we would have built beautiful, dynamic client-side visualization engines.<p>The last few years of progress in JS execution has opened the web up as a platform target for a large range of apps.  And every inch we push that forward opens the door for a few more potential applications to reasonably be moved to the web.  That's what it means to me, anyway.  Push the line forward a few inches, and it means a few more features that somebody wasn't able to implement before, but are able to now.  A few more apps that can target the web.<p>That means more to some people and less to others.  But I can say with certainty that it would have meant a lot to my prior bioinformatician self.  And I'm sure there are developers like me, out there, who look at what JS can do, increasing day by day, and ask themselves ""now what can I build with that?"".<p>I think it's a good thing to make the answer to that question as open ended as possible :)",1365220393

As an example, the rate of engine failure in twin-engine planes is greater than for single-engine planes.  It's obvious if you think about it: there are now two points of failure instead of one.  Why have two-engined planes?

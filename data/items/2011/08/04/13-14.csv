Probably all these companies think that <i>in principle</i> the patent system is screwed up; they spend BILLIONS of dollars buying and litigating patents, and most likely every single one of these companies would rather spend the cash on R&D or something more useful. However, <i>in practice</i> a company that does this is going to suffer, and suffer badly.<p>The complaint against Google is their whining. Yes, they don't like the patent system. Yes, they also aggressively bid pi billion to increase their patent portfolio. However, complaining afterwards that the problem is with the ""other guys"" is just stupid. Complain about the system, OK; it's a messed up system, we all know that. Complain about the other guy, when you were just doing the exact same thing a minute ago, now you're just a whiner, and you should grow up.",1312466389

That's why memoization isn't implemented for you.<p>Scheme was also designed to encourage implementing non-recursive control structures, as well as programming with side effects.  Scheme isn't supposed to be totally pure.  If you encounter a problem that requires mutation, you're supposed to try to abstract away from the mutation, if possible, and it gives you the tools to do that. (first class functions, macros, continuations, etc. are all very effective tools for abstraction, once you learn them.)<p>I recommend that you use SICP to learn Scheme, as it will make more sense when you actually know how to use it.  It's an incredibly elegant and beautiful language, and it's certainly still relevant.<p>P.S.

They were not type errors in the sense that the compiler was preventing me from making bugs, but rather type errors in the sense that I had to figure out a whole bunch of things about the type system in order to try and convince the compiler to accept my program.<p>There's a heavy cognitive load to programming in Haskell, and I hit many walls where I just had to Figure It Out before I could compile my programs.<p>(All this was as an experienced programmer. Maybe it would be easier for a newbie not used to dynamic languages!)",1312465356

I graduated high school in 1995 and after a year and a half of college, I left for a job offer that I thought was going to land me in a home on the beach. When things are booming, and you have a talent that is in demand, it's easy to make a go at it without a degree. A lot of the promises turn out to be empty though.<p>Fortunately, I really enjoy being an entrepreneur, which is one of the few careers in which you don't ""interview for jobs"" all that often. As an entrepreneur, your resume is your ability to create successful outcomes. Starting your career during the dot-com boom-bust is kind of like a free pass. You get to talk about it like it made sense. Most people accept at face value that in 1997, quitting college and working for a dot-com made perfect sense. Almost 15 years later, everyone focuses on the fact that you've been in the industry for 15 years. You end up with plenty of stories to tell that mask the fact that you never got to study subjects like computational complexity and big O notation in college.<p>Like most, I wouldn't change anything about the path I've taken, because I love where I'm at, but if I were starting today, dropping out of college isn't even something I'd consider. I'm not suggesting anyone should rack up $100k in student debt, but I do think sticking it out is worth the trip.",1312465216

Because we all agree that it is. How much gold is there? Whatever is reported by the governments who hold it. There's no way to check. There are ways to guess, but it's just a shiny metal that we all agree is worth exchange.<p>Limiting us to gold also exposes us to massive economic swings, due to the limited ability to control how much or how little we all agree exists. I always hear people talk about how we 'print money' when we need it but NO ONE mentions that we also take money OUT of the economy all of the time.",1312464438

It doesn't seem to have gone into any major infrastructure projects that I am aware of.<p>When your entire problem is a lack of economic activity, investments should be made that produce positive net benefits.<p>As a side note, to call Washington Keynesian is to fundamentally misunderstand Keynes. Truly Keynesian economic policy would not continuously run a budget deficit. A central tenet of Keynesian economics is that a Government saves when times are good and spends when times are bad. Washington spends when times are good and spends when times are bad.<p>Edit: Also, one thing that is very important to keep in mind is that the States have received only marginal amounts of assistance with their budgetary woes.

They will be easy enough to find on Google if they're available so instead, make compelling offers where you provide discounts in exchange for customers purchasing more or taking some other action. Look at rental car web sites. Most offer a ""Deals"" page where you can see coupon codes because they realized the codes were easily shared anyways.<p>c) Don't use a text box. Instead create referral links with the code embedded so that only people using the links will get the coupon code. This way, people without codes never see the option to enter one.<p>d) Check the HTTP referrer when a visitor first arrives and apply coupon codes as needed OR only display the coupon box when you know a customer has come from an advertiser site.<p>e) Proactively suggest offers that don't require coupon codes at all. For example, when a customer has $97 of items in their cart, display a message box offering a discount if they purchase > $100.",1312462966

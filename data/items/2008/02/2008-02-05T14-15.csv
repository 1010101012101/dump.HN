109720,comment,109683,109699,0,0,PJCrosier,,,"Right, the FAQ puts emphasis on you streaming one song at a time to people you know - I don't see how this is different from streaming ten songs to ten people you don't know, you're still sending music to people who don't own a copy of it. Not that I agree with the way the music industry seems to be going, but I imagine they could come knocking wanting a big piece of your pie?",1202222645

109718,comment,108861,109338,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It isn't the mechanics of typing, it's the entire paradigm. Why would I need to use Arabic characters in some sort of pseudo-English to represent what I wanted the computer to do? Why not spoken words? Or emotional nuances?<p>Not trying to go way off the deep end, but I think people make a big mistake when they say that since we have a printed code situation now we'll always have one. I'm already seeing a lot of graphical programming environments. Sure -- they suck to some degree. But each year they suck less and less. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to believe that fairly soon a lot of programming could be done graphically. I would think a spoken conversation, with the computer rapidly prototyping, executing, and testing the concepts as we discussed them, could create some very complex solutions. It's not about typing or the mechanics -- it's the paradigm that's outdated.",1202222624

I'm glad some people are prepared to push the laws even if I'm not sure I'd take that risk in my own startup. I guess the legal analogy they're going for here is that you are lending your friend the song, just like lending a physical CD. It sounds pretty reasonable but the law isn't really defined by what sounds reasonable.<p>I think with the restrictive nature of this service the RIAA et al might see it as being in line with their view on a music purchasors license.",1202222526

109713,comment,109694,109694,0,0,mynameishere,,,"If the labor market works, it seems like people should settle into positions where they are about average--and the standard deviation should stay small. If you take a random group of coders and give them brain teaser-style problems, of course large differences between performance will occur. If you gave people tasks completely outside their abilities, of course they will score a ""zero"". That says nothing about how they do their actual jobs.",1202222111

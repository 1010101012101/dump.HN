These tasks are derived from your Goals, and Projects lists (He recommends that you start with only ONE goal for year, for e.g Learn Spanish, and break it down into 6-month goals, 1-month goals, and weekly goals). Furthermore, we all have projects on our plates, but he recommends that we<p><pre><code>  1. Pick only 3 projects (of which one should be tied to your ONE goal)\n  2. Finish ALL 3 projects before putting 3 more on the plate.\n</code></pre>\nThese projects (ideally those things that require more than 1 To-do item, otherwise they would be just a To-do item :D), along with your goals should drive your To-do list (We all have other items on a day to day basis, and these do show up on your things to do, but more about that in a minute).<p>With all that in place, you should, on a day-to-day basis establish the 3 things you that will take you one step closer to your GOAL, or completion of a project - These MITs (decided on the night before, or first thing in the morning) are the first things you do everyday. That way, you know you have knocked out important items without having the day, or your manager, or your email throw you off.<p>He even recommends checking your email at 10 am (if possible, or later than the absolute first thing in the morning, because if you are like most people, your email usually has a few To-dos in it).<p>I have just incorporated his advice and am attempting to apply the same and I have to say that I feel so much less cluttered and far more focused. Knowing that I am doing what I need to do and then relegating myself to the not-so-important tasks later on the day seems to free up so much of the internal chatter in my head.<p>[Disclaimer - The link above is an a non-affiliate link, and I have no connection with the author other than having just read his book]",1328482795

The facilities for continuing education courses are also often less robust.<p>Take CCA in San Francisco.

3555575,comment,3554719,3555393,5,0,Retric,,,"<i>I know of no profession in which practitioners do not generally get better over time.</i> Football players and Strippers don't automatically get better with time and despite learning new things their overall performance decreases with time.  More generally any profession that deals with burnout either physical or mental has the same sort's of issues.<p>Look, my Mother has 2 PHD's in education and often does professional workshops for teachers.  However, like most forms of professional development her workshops are both expensive and their value is hard to quantify.  So it may pay better than her normal job but as she says it's of limited value.<p>Programming is a lot like teaching it takes a few years to get up to speed, but vary quickly years of experience stops being a useful metric.",1328482635
3555574,comment,3554863,3554863,1,0,vladoh,,,"I think it is not possible to achieve the quality of a peer review by ""crowd review"" or ""social review"". While most of the people are able to rate a funny picture or an interesting article on Internet, the review of an academic paper requires much more expertise in the field and knowledge of the related work. Therefore I don't believe that a truly objective rating can be created. Also, making a peer review is time consuming because you have to really understand the paper in detail and think about if the contributions are big enough and well explained, if the experiments are done properly and if the comparisons are fare and so on. This is not an easy thing to achieve by just throwing a lot of people on it (the users of the Internet).<p>Furthermore, when a paper is published in a well recognized journal or conference one has a guarantee of the quality of the paper. For example when I see something published at CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) I know it is certainly worth reading. I don't want to imagine how much more difficult it will be to find the valuable papers among all the bad stuff that is being submitted for review and rejected.<p>I don't want to say that the peer review process is perfect, but if I have to choose between ""peer review"" and ""crowd review"" I choose the former.",1328482608

Education ends is too conflated with nationalist and career ambitions. If students were given the encouragement and support to complete relevant projects that can translate into attractive college applications or on-the-job skills, students would be better served to enter the workforce and would probably more effectively see the relevance of their actions. It's difficult to test student success and standardized tests, organized by specialist subjects, become irrelevant.<p>Marshall McLuhan (in the sixties) talked about how instant access to information made specialization in education less relevant. He predicted that schools would cease operating under the industrial assumption of specialization. In fact, many other hard boundaries - work/leisure, education/employment - would become blurred and resemble more pre-industrial, and even pre-literate, sensibilities. Unfortunately, technology moves so much slower than ideology, and people are treating the ""jobs of the future"" as if one learns math, and then one can work in some math-making factory, or something, for the rest of their life.<p>The dichotomy the author presents is irrelevant.

3555525,story,,,1,0,patcell,"Lodsys Reexam Update - New Prior Art?",,"As many readers of this blog are likely aware, Lodsys has asserted that many application developers are infringing claims of its U.S. Patent Nos. 7,222,078 and/or 7,620,565 (Ill refer to them as the Lodsys Patent Claims).<p>While these patents seemingly expire August 6, 2012 (as a result of the priority claims and the terminal disclaimers that were filed in each patent), Google nonetheless continues its quest to invalidate the Lodsys Patent Claims.  It is worth noting, that once a patent expires or is invalidated, it cannot then be infringed by anyone.<p>In summary, Google initiated Reexamination proceedings with respect to U.S. Patent No. 7,620,565 (Reexamination Control No. 95/000,638) and U.S. Patent No. 7,222,078 (Reexamination Control No. 95/000,639) seeking to invalidate the Lodsys Patent Claims.  The patent office adopted a majority of Googles proposed rejections.  In response, Lodsys submitted Declarations seeking to overcome the patent office rejections (and particularly U.S. Pat. 5,965,505).<p>The Declarations submitted by Lodsys identified a number of reports authored by Daniel Abelow and Dr. Barbara Flagg.  Interestingly, these reports were dated Spring 1991 --- which is more than one year prior to the earliest filing dates of the Lodsys patents.<p>Google, seizing upon this, now proposes a number of additional rejections and enforcement issues based on these reports.  For example, Google now proposes that the Lodsys Patent Claims are invalid under 35 USC 102(b), because:<p>1.	one is not entitled to a patent if the invention was described in a printed publication more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent, and the reports predate Lodsyss relevant patent application by more than a year;\n2.	one is not entitled to a patent if the invention was in public use, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent, and the Declaration/reports indicate such a system was pilot tested and open to a number of students; and\n3.	one shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent, and the Declaration/reports indicate Harvard accepted a proposal (arguably prior to Spring 1991) that was successfully completed.<p>If Google is correct on any of these points, the Lodsys Patent Claims appear to be unpatentable or invalid.<p>Google also notes that Lodsys never submitted the reports to the patent office despite its obligation to disclose information that may be material to patentability.  A violation of this duty with respect to any claim could render all claims unpatentable or invalid.<p>In sum, the Lodsys Patent Claims seem to expire this summer and Lodsyss efforts to keep the Lodsys Patent Claims from being invalidated have seemingly opened up a lodestone of new arguments that may be used to mitigate their impact.<p>Stay tuned.",1328481429

We went to them with a problem like ""5/8 + 1/4""...to which they would respond ""I don't know""...then we said ""You have bought weed before right?"" ""yes"" is the response.  Well...if you have 7/8 of weed and you add another quarter ounce what do you have.  Every time...the got it immediately.  The teachers came back to us and asked what we had done differently...we explained.

If you offload that responsibility to videos that kids can watch outside of class and/or at their own pace, class time becomes an opportunity for kids to work together to understand the concepts and gives teachers the opportunity to figure out how to best reach each individual child.

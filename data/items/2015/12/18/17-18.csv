A &quot;hello world&quot; QML program is like 50 MB. You can get it down to about 20 MB is you use a custom Unicode library build (there is a 20 MB DLL which just contains Unicode data).<p>* The QML compiler is only in the commercial version. I know there is a third party open source version, but that is too much hassle. And yeah maybe I should pay, but hey!<p>* Lots of things still are impossible with QML. There&#x27;s no decent basic text widget (e.g. for a log output).<p>* You can make custom QML widgets, but they can&#x27;t render text. Kind of limiting!<p>* I don&#x27;t think the basic premise of QML works that well. There is such a big difference between C++ types and QML types most of your code ends up dealing with the mapping. Especially lists of things are very hard to get right (and the documentation doesn&#x27;t really point you to the &quot;right&quot; solution - which is to subclass QAbstractListModel if you were wondering).<p>* QML seems very hacky and javascripty - it doesn&#x27;t scale well. Especially scopes and id&#x27;s.<p>* Some QML things are weirdly hard, for example<p>- Rich tooltips<p>- Adding padding around list items<p>- Doing anything with the rich text widget.<p>That said, I still really like it. I&#x27;d just like it more if they:<p>1. Reduce the size.<p>2. Redo QML (again!). I&#x27;d be even ok with a custom language. It can be similar to Javascript, but it should support the native C++ Qt types (and custom ones) much easier.",1450461546

Upgrading starts with rebuilding and repackaging all dependencies. Not fun, and not a good use of time.<p>For such software, containers make it feasible to administer as somewhat manageable units: You create the Dockerfile or whatever to install the software you want, and run the resulting image on a host, and bring configuration in via puppet or something. Then, when you need to upgrade, you rebuild your image and deploy it on the host; rollbacks are trivial, as is scaling, or creating test environments.<p>You can of course achieve the same sort of thing with virtual machines providing you have good orchestration. However, often a deployment can consist of multiple software components that are separate units, but can (or must) share a single host.<p>I think so long as Linux containers don&#x27;t actually offer real security, that&#x27;s the niche where they are useful.",1450461446

So, yes, making probabilistic assumptions based on sex and acting on them is, in many cases, sexism.<p>> ) For a woman I don&#x27;t know, I buy her frozen yogurt. 2) For a man I don&#x27;t know, I buy him pizza.<p>If you want to get people food that they want, you can just ask them. (And, in any case, context is probably more important than sex: IME, women are more likely to prefer pizza to froyo for a meal, and men are more likely to prefer froyo to pizza for a dessert; there&#x27;re are very few contexts where &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;froyo&quot; are comparable alternatives where sex would be the prime differentiator on how people would respond to them -- and elevating sex above more relevant decision criteria is a pretty strong indication of sexism.)",1450461393

I&#x27;d be afraid of super-human charm much more than super-human intelligence.<p>See these paragraphs in the post to which you replied:<p>>Walking into a meeting of the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, joining as the 55th member, and later seizing control of the state requires intelligence. Landing in a dingy yacht with 81 men, bleeding a regime to death, and ruling it until your death requires intelligence. Buying the rights to the Quick and Dirty Operating System, licensing it to IBM, and becoming the de facto standard OS for all consumer computing requires intelligence. Presenting yourself as a folksy Texan when you&#x27;re a private-school elite from Connecticut and convincing the electorate that you&#x27;d have a beer with them requires intelligence. All of these outcomes are goals, and accomplishing them demonstrates an ability to actually put the rubber to the road.<p>>You&#x27;re confusing the technical term of intelligence, which means something along the lines of &quot;ability to accomplish goals,&quot; with the social construct of &quot;intelligence&quot; which means something along the lines of &quot;ability to impress people.&quot; Intelligence is not always impressive, and humans have a fantastic ability to write off the accomplishments of others when they want to make the world appear more just. I mean, nobody feels good about the fact that we&#x27;re one Napoleon away from a totally different world system that may or may not suit our interests. The belief that the world is somehow fundamentally different to the extent that the next Napoleon-class intelligence who isn&#x27;t content managing a hedge fund and just increasing an int in a bank database can&#x27;t actually redraw the world map, is just an illusion we tell ourselves to make the world we live in more fair, the stories we live out more meaningful, and the events of our lives have a little bit more importance.<p>>Ironically, the fact that people like me view the AI-scare as a religious apocalypse that is as threatening as any other religious apocalypse implies one of two things:<p>Some alternative explanations:<p>3. You&#x27;re wrong, and super-human AI is a massive issue, regardless of how you pattern-match it as &quot;religious&quot;<p>4. You&#x27;re not creative enough (one might dare say &quot;intelligent&quot; but that would be too snarky) to imagine all the ways in which an AI could devastate humanity without it having much intelligence or much charm<p>5. Your view of the world is factually incorrect, I mean you believe things like:<p>>Mental disabilities aside, very high IQ seems to be correlated with relatively low charm and low ability to solve particular problems (how to get people to do what you want) that are far more dangerous than the kind of problem-solving intelligence (or how we commonly define it) is capable of solving. &quot;Super&quot; intelligent people are terrible problem-solvers when the problems involve other humans.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that IQ is a good proxy for intelligence (it isn&#x27;t): what IQ do you think Bill Gates or Napoleon or Warren Buffet or Karl Rove have? What IQ do you think Steve Jobs or Steve Ballmer had/have? Do you think they&#x27;re just &quot;average&quot; or just not &quot;very high&quot;?<p>This:<p>>very high IQ seems to be correlated with relatively low charm<p>is <i>again</i> the just world fallacy! There is no law of the universe that makes people very good at abstract problem solving bad at social situations. In fact, most hyper-successful people are almost certainly good at both.<p>And that ignores the fact that cognitive biases DO exist, and it&#x27;s very possible to apply the scientific method and empirical problem solving to finding them, and then exploiting humans that way. This is a huge subfield of psychology (persuasion) and the basis of marketing. Do you think it takes some super-special never-going-to-be-replicated feat of non-Turing-computable human thought to write Zynga games?<p>It&#x27;s nice to think the world is a safe place, but the reality is that our social order is increasingly precarious and an AI could easily disrupt that.",1450461100

Haskell is excellently suited for solving extremely complex problems and why it&#x27;s so desirable for concurrency and parallelism tasks.<p>On your second point, while it seems nice to have Haskell features slowly percolate into other languages, I urge caution in thinking that&#x27;s a panacea for not learning more complex languages.

What I am saying is that (if you&#x27;re American) you are reaping the benefits of a society that exists as it does because it dominated a continent, destroying much of the existing landscape and natural inhabitants.  There is some level of responsibility that individuals have for prior actions taken by their society.  Surely not as great a responsibility as if you&#x27;d done the actions yourself, or approved of the actions at the time they were taken.

(&quot;And let&#x27;s not think about the fact the benevolent state itself is made out of people.&quot;) But that&#x27;s wrong; humans are not &quot;generally&quot; irrational, they are <i>specifically</i> irrational in very human ways, and the introduction of non-rational agents <i>greatly expands</i> the possibility space of economic theories, it does not contract it to an obvious point.<p>You could narrow it back down to roughly the same sized space as we started with if you could <i>precisely characterize</i> the <i>exact</i> ways in which the agents are irrational, but we can not currently do that. There&#x27;s a long history of the very irrationality of humans getting in the way of determining what behaviors are irrational! Or, in other words, it is not necessarily obvious what is irrational. A simple example is loss aversion; is it irrational? Well, when you consider that in the real world, &quot;0&quot; can mean &quot;starving to death&quot;, suddenly taking small, safe bets in preference to large, unsafe bets even when the latter nominally has a larger expected payoff can end up being rational, inasmuch as the former actually results in a longer expected lifespan. Determining &quot;rational&quot; is really quite hard, and I rather expect more &quot;human irrationalities&quot; to be determined to be &quot;more rational than the putatively-rational simpler model&quot; in the future. Along with a heavy dose of &quot;yes, this is irrational, and we have this in the species because it was harmless up to about 100 years ago&quot;.<p>You can&#x27;t map irrationalities to macroeconomics with anything less than this scale of simulation; the entire point of the rational agent was to make simple equations model things, the very point of abandoning that model is recognizing that the economy can only be modeled by more complicated models that aren&#x27;t captured by those equations.<p>Unfortunately, the universe does not have a law in it that says we will have the power to know what it is we want to know in any practical manner.<p>And 100s of millions was just an example. Just as rough in the 1980s would have been the lack of practical programming environments. You can still do 100,000 agents today with a reasonable amount of state in a simply NumPy script that runs on your local desktop. That was not true up until fairly recently, because there would have been no solution as powerful as NumPy running on modern hardware.",1450459909

Use Tor - this is probably useless for most people due to the low speed of browsing (I know everyone has to pitch in to share bandwidth with others, but this is not an easy compromise at all).<p>2. Use Privacy Badger - I do use it with Firefox and Chrome, but it&#x27;s not available for other browsers, which is not ideal for me.<p>3. Use NoScript - I tried this a long time ago and found that it crippled almost every site I regularly visited. I realized this was too heavy and cumbersome a solution.

Other people are not as privileged.<p>There is zero correlation between the values I hold in this discussion and what best serves my personal interest. I have the capacity to completely detach myself from my arguments in a way that leads to a lack of bias. I am morally and intellectually selfless.<p>Legislation should never arise from anecdotes or personal preferences. Would I be abused or stalked, the fact that transparency is inherently superior wouldn&#x27;t change.<p>> It would be nice if we could live in an open society, but the reality is that discrimination and abuse still exist. Insisting that everybody forget about privacy is not only going to get some people killed and many others fired. Insisting that privacy is bad is effectively telling any minority that they have to stay &quot;in the closet&quot; if they want to keep their job and not be harassed by the bigots in society.<p>There is no debate to be had about the fact that pain will be involved in the transition to a transparent society. Of course it won&#x27;t be easy. However, it would be unreasonable to  ignore the biggest problem of our time just because of a short-term friction. Like any form of investment in life, there are short-term drawbacks.<p>Human reasoning is weird as it understands a loss to be worse than a lack of gain. Loss aversion is the reason why we don&#x27;t change things, which is the reason we can&#x27;t get nicer things. People have no idea how much they&#x27;re missing by trying to preserve &quot;their&quot; privacy.<p>We&#x27;re all &quot;in the closet&quot; in some regards. We&#x27;re also all bigots. We must force people out of their closet. We must expose bigotry. Only then will things start to improve.<p>> We have the freedom to decide what we want to disclose publicly.<p>Quoting the Bible would have had the same effect.<p>> We have the freedom to decide what we want to disclose publicly.<p>Actually we don&#x27;t. Should I have the right to erase something from your brain because you saw something I didn&#x27;t want you to see? Of course I&#x27;m not suggesting that we should coerce people into doing anything they don&#x27;t want to do, but a person&#x27;s actions shouldn&#x27;t be protected by any external entity. At the end of the day, an honest person has a lot more to gain by exposing themselves to the world instead of keeping things to themselves. IoT, Wearables, Big Data, AI are all concrete examples of how data gathering can improve people&#x27;s lives.<p>> Of course, you still believe in privacy. If you really think privacy doesn&#x27;t make any sense, post your name, address, bank account numbers, social security number, and any email addresses you&#x27;ve used. None of those items are &quot;secret&quot; information (like a password). I could list a lot more things, but you should get the idea.<p>Privacy and Transparency are not games you can play alone. They&#x27;re inherently social. The society is built on top of expectations of privacy. For example, there is some information that I legally couldn&#x27;t disclose, even if I wanted to. Likewise, my identity is only secured by archaic methods of authentication, which completely breaks if my password gets known. Private key cryptography is not a technology we should build sensitive systems on top of, and it will quickly be destroyed once P = NP gets proven and applied.<p>Your question is like asking a person to not wear a seat belt in an unsafe car. I might not think that humans should wear seat belts forever, yet I still wear one when I drive my car every day.<p>Fast-forward 1000 years in the future. Total transparency. Ask a person whether they&#x27;d like to keep their name, address, bank account numbers, social security number, email address (assuming these things still exist which they won&#x27;t). Surely, that person would refuse to make this information private as doing so would make his life miserable considering all the benefits this used to enable.<p>The least I can ask from people is to discuss this issue seriously, and not just accept privacy to be the solution to all of our problems. This whole obsession with privacy is just a distraction.",1450459388

Working for a web development shop that has big customers doesn&#x27;t count here IMO because your work as an engineer is largely unchanged regardless of your customer paying you $2000 or $200k.<p>2.

People are miserable enough in F500 companies as it is, this is probably among the worst places for combination of stress, pay, and career mobility.<p>3. Work in a non-software company. A company whose business doesn&#x27;t take its software seriously invariably treats its software and IT resources as cost centers meant to get maximum cost savings for as little money as possible via opex reduction and will, ironically, likely fail to make bigger expenditures required to keep costs (and really, wasting time) lower.<p>Being around non-motivated people in a demoralized environment is a great way to kill any starting career and learning what the signs of these organizational attributes are have important for avoiding really bad career moves.",1450458784

I know you don&#x27;t care one way or another, but for the sake of other readers, I&#x27;d like to point it out(and BTW, your specific example (taken from blowski) isn&#x27;t really sexist as I don&#x27;t quite see how it keeps women away from power, but that&#x27;s beside the point):<p>> I need to ignore information and make worse decisions?<p>Ignoring information and making worse decisions are two different things. Or, more precisely, by <i>not ignoring</i> some statistical data you are ignoring <i>other</i> pieces of information, such as our understanding of social dynamics. Ignoring yesterday&#x27;s information about the train&#x27;s arrival time would only lead to a much better decision making if you want to get to the train on time and you know that the train runs on a different schedule on weekends and yesterday was a Sunday. A piece of data is mostly useless (and even misleading) if you don&#x27;t know what model it samples. Statistical data on human behavior is usually very bad information because history shows us that <i>preferences</i> change all the time (except for obvious things, like that people want power and are afraid of death). In fact, if women preference for frozen yogurt over pizza stayed <i>constant</i> throughout the ages it would be the exception rather than the rule.<p>If you base your decision <i>only</i> on <i>statistical</i> information of the kind you describe, you&#x27;re creating a conservative feedback loop. We now know that people&#x27;s assumptions about others&#x27; behavior may affect the other&#x27;s behavior, and so behaving in accordance with past behavior (because that&#x27;s what most of your information is really about) simply perpetuates the current condition.<p>The information you shouldn&#x27;t ignore is the deeper information that comes from the actual study of social dynamics. That information tells us that changing your behavior to not conform to past behavior would (and constantly does) change society&#x27;s future state. This is where social dynamics diverge from physics and the train schedule. We can <i>decide</i> to affect them (not necessarily determine them, because it&#x27;s very hard to predict the behavior of such a complex system, but our actions definitely change the dynamics; we know this for a fact).<p>The only question is, which way do you <i>want</i> to direct society: do you want to keep it as it is for as long as possible, or change it according to your values?",1450458750

Have you explored it?<p>(An initial implementation for an initial release of the Rakudo compiler was worked on over the last few years and declared done, modulo bugs, a few weeks ago. A recent blog post provides a friendly overview.[1].)<p>One notable difference is that Swift adopts an iteration-only view of strings for dealing with characters whereas Perl 6 does not. One consequence is that indexing operations in Perl 6 are O(1) (time) at the expense of potentially (and for the current implementation, typically) greater use of RAM.<p>> BTW to your point on len(x) + len(y). The answer is 2 if you define len() on Unicode scalars but 1 if you define it on characters. Why? because len(&quot;\u301&quot;) should be 0.<p>Are you 100% sure of this of your last sentence (&quot;should be 0&quot;)? I get that it&#x27;s intuitively reasonable that an isolated base modifier be length 0 but I thought the Unicode standard specified (or at least recommended) that it be 1, and I note that Perl 6 treats isolated base modifiers (or at least this particular one) as length 1:<p>> (&quot;a&quot;).chars\n1<p>> (0x301.chr).chars\n1<p>> (&quot;a&quot; ~ 0x301.chr).chars\n1<p>So both Swift and Perl 6 correctly report the length of &quot;a&quot; as 1 and an &quot;a&quot; concatenated with &quot;\u301&quot; as 1 but disagree on what to do with an isolated base modifier.<p>> It is, of course, true that getting this right is likely to be substantially more expensive than getting it wrong but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be done.<p>Indeed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/day-7-unicode-perl-6-and-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/day-7-unicode-p...</a>",1450458345

In general, there are other cases where grapheme cluster breaks are not preserved by string concatenation, and you often want a locale-specific version anyway.",1450458000

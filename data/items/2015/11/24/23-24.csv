Everyone assumes that there is because of the opinion in Schenck v.

You can&#x27;t just claim XP had longer support except for all those &quot;continually updated OSes&quot; and still have a point left!</i><p>Rolling release distros are a different ball game entirely. If you take a copy of Windows 7 you can install every update from the initial release to present day. It might take you a while, but you could do it. Equally with your standard release cycle Linux distros, you could take a 3 year old copy of Ubuntu LTS (for example) and bring it bang up to date. However if you took a 3 year old image of a rolling release distro, you&#x27;d find it hugely more difficult to update (if at all possible).<p>Rolling release distros don&#x27;t have a set end of life date because they&#x27;re always incrementally reaching end of life. Particularly as breaking changes become old and unsupported (eg try taking an Arch Linux ISO before the <i>filesystem</i>, <i>glibc</i> and <i>systemd</i> packages and watch just how poorly that ISO updates). So something being &quot;rolling release&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have an end of life - it just means you don&#x27;t have to perform OS release upgrades.<p><i>> Why are there are so many defensive anti GNU comments here? Do these actual facts that correctly paint Microsoft in a bad light really upset that many Microsoft users / workers / proprietary software proponents?</i><p>Why do some people think you must be a fanboy or an employee to defend a product? If you want my honest personal opinion: I <i>hate</i> Windows. Absolutely despise it. Please bare in mind this is just my personal opinion, but I just cannot fathom it&#x27;s maze of confusing windows, I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s command line is crippled and that Powershell is about as succinct as <i>War And Peace</i>. I hate the lack of a proper package manager (I could write a novel on how much I hate Windows Update). I hate the poor support for nix networking protocols. I hate the outdated file system support. I don&#x27;t even find it aesthetically attractive. So there really isn&#x27;t much I like about Windows.<p>At work I run Linux and manage Linux and Solaris servers (I&#x27;m devops) and at home I run Linux and FreeBSD. I don&#x27;t own nor run a single Windows system and haven&#x27;t done so in any serious capacity since the early days XP. I really couldn&#x27;t be any further from the &quot;pro-Microsoft&quot; pigeon-hole you presumed.<p>I know there are people who feel the same way about Linux, and that&#x27;s fine. I wouldn&#x27;t want a Linux monopoly any more than I&#x27;d want a Windows monopoly. And I&#x27;m certainly not going to accuse those people of being Microsoft employees :P I just believe in being objective because nothing is perfect and we can&#x27;t improve things if we look at everything with rose-tinted glasses.<p><i>> Also, what is with legitimate comments being ghosted on this site?</i><p>Most of the comments that have ghosted are because they were complaining that the article was factual thus couldn&#x27;t be FUD. But that misses the point of what FUD is. FUD doesn&#x27;t have to be a lie, it can also be a heavily biased fact that casts the opposition in an unfairly bad light. I personally felt the Windows XP support argument was one example of that; it was factually accurate but conveniently overlooks Linuxes similar issues of long term support<p>I do have a great deal of respect for GNU and RMS, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to agree with everything posted in their name.",1448409029

This happened almost 5 years ago, though, and nowadays there are lots of Pokémon apps on the Play Store (<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/search?q=pokedex&c=apps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/search?q=pokedex&c=apps</a>), so I can only assume that they&#x27;ve softened their views.<p>That said, it&#x27;s their IP, and they&#x27;re free to wield the DMCA hammer as they see fit. For me, though, the point of Pokedex.org is to show what you can do with 2015-era web tech, and that, on Android at least, the web has already (mostly) caught up with native. I mean, this app is arguably superior than my old Froyo-era native app, and it&#x27;s all HTML/CSS/JS!

It certainly generalizes, but you have to do quite a lot of sysadmin work to keep an app running healthily. Docker was an improvement on that, taking away some underlying system work. But then losing the security benefits of VMs and still, in the end, requiring a bunch of systemsy stuff.<p>Of course Heroku kept firing with its buildpacks supporting lots of platforms and a host of infrastructure provided as a service.

We&#x27;re just slowly decreasing the surface area of those interfaces and increasing their security.

Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?\nA passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:\n Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship.

Both the web console and API interface worked great for us.<p>* I was able to get Lambda development working end-to-end with a Makefile and the AWS CLI.<p>* API Gateway was a bear to work with. The concepts are unintuitive, the interface sucks, and the logging is lackluster. I found it difficult to go through the develop/test/deploy cycle on because of these issues.<p>* API Gateway is brand new. Brand new AWS services have bugs. We hit bugs.<p>* API Gateway documentation is awful.<p>* API Gateway had a bug where it stopped logging. If it doesn&#x27;t log, it is literally impossible to debug. This hard-stopped development for 5 days while they worked on a fix.<p>* There&#x27;s an invisible error case where your API doesn&#x27;t have permissions to invoke the Lambda command. It&#x27;s easy to hit and annoying.<p>* API Gateway doesn&#x27;t support POST requests in the way you would expect. This leads to over-complicated setups for simple use cases.<p>* I really don&#x27;t prefer the way mapping templates work in API Gateway.<p>Overall, our setup is humming along nicely, but it&#x27;s just 2 routes.

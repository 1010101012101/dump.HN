Maybe it was the excellent writing quality or maybe I just find things like this interesting.<p>As someone who just graduated with a B.S. in chemical engineering and will start work toward my PhD in the fall (also in chemical engineering, but will actually involve a TON of programming), this strikes a chord with me.<p>A few takeaways from the article:<p>-The author does not give himself nearly enough credit.  ""Self-deprecating"" is probably the right term.  He considers himself average, but he is far above average.  I mean this as a compliment of course.<p>-I think some of those tools he wrote could actually help me with my work (particularly CDE) -- I'll have to go take a look.<p>-I am going to have to learn how to focus, and very quickly.  I consider myself very motivated/stubborn but I get distracted so easily that it's ridiculous, and this is not going to work for grad school unless I alter my behavior substantially before I get there.<p>-Before reading his book, I too had the idealized notion of ""brilliant idea, years of writing one paper about it"".  The reality isn't quite as fantastic, but I appreciate learning the truth over belated disillusionment.<p>-Just realized the author is pgbovine -- excellent work!  I currently have a completely free summer to do whatever -- would you have any tips on how I should prepare before I get to grad school?  I already know which professor I will be working with, so I'm trying to figure out what level of ""initiative"" I should take before I arrive.",1341032336

4180682,comment,4180075,4180075,0,0,neya,,,"1) This is purely my opinion - There is a fundamental problem with these Lytros. Photography is an art, and art is not easy, which is exactly why art has some value, and not everyone can come up with art. It gives one a sense of joy, pride and achievement, when someone comes up with their own art, because they have taken the pains to capture the right subject, at the right moment with the right focus. What Lytro does is removes this sense of achievement, pride by making it easier for anyone and everyone to capture photos with the right subject, with the right focus - Even if they had captured it originally wrong. It makes the pro's look like idiots.<p>2) Design - The traditional DSLR's give you a sense of satisfaction, completion and pride when you hold them, because when someone else sees you holding them, they know you are putting in some effort to capture good photos.<p>The Lytro on the other hand looks like a traditional Kaleidoscope and when someone looks at you holding them - 1) They think its some toy, if they've never heard or seen a Lytro before or 2) They know its a device that lets anyone capture beautiful photos, so its no big deal.<p>There is very little pride of ownership in owning a Lytro, with contrast to a DSLR.<p>The Lytro needs some design elements from the traditional DSLR, to make it more appealing to the Masses. Had the Lytro been pitched in the form-factor of a DSLR, but with all the features that Lytro has now, it would have caught up like forest fire.<p>Lens compatibility. When people buy DSLR's, MOST of them buy  the body because they know its from a company that manufactures great lenses (Eg: Canon). With Lytro, I'm not even sure if there are plans to manufacture external Lenses. Even if Lytro does manufacture them, it won't matter because companies like Canon/Nikon have a great array of Lenses, proven with the test of time. Lytro should in the least add support to fix lenses from 3rd party companies.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1341031961

4180664,comment,4180537,4180537,22,0,caladri,,,"For the set of features you have, with most calling conventions on most platforms you don't need to synthesize all that.  You could simply have your apply function be written in assembly and handle setting up the parameters fetching them from memory.<p>That also isn't higher-order programming as such.  Can you create new functions from doing that?  There are ways to compose functions in C by hand, but the distinction is that it cannot be done elegantly.  (One could always just do higher-order programming in C by constructing an abstract syntax tree, after all.)<p>A good first effort in that you did correctly handle calling functions without requiring them to fetch their arguments in an unusual way, which is what most people would try at first.  With a varargs apply function, you can handle the case of passing values larger than a register and passing pointers without having to cast them to a list, too.  Consider the case of an apply function which takes an unsigned integer as the size of the following argument.  If it's zero, then the argument list is finished.  Otherwise, it then fetches an argument of that size from the va_list and goes on to the next one.  So then your apply function is slightly uglier (int j = 42; apply(printf, sizeof (const char <i>), ""Hello, %s!  %u\n"", sizeof (const char </i>), ""world""), sizeof j, j, 0) but perhaps more flexible, and at least avoids relying on a few nasty implicit casts.<p>Also, function pointers should not necessarily be cast implicitly to void *, but on only a few architectures are function pointers so strange that you'll have any trouble with your approach.<p>As it is, you could even avoid writing or generating any assembly by just having the apply routine be a static inline function that does a switch on the argument count and then casts the function pointer to a function pointer that takes the right number of arguments.  The compiler could do constant propagation for the number of arguments and you'd have little overhead in your function calls.  You couldn't handle arbitrarily-large argument lists, but it would work pretty well.<p>Keep at it!",1341031776

We don't really use the Backbone router/controller concept that heavily.<p>- For data, we're exposing everything through a REST-like API exposed from our Rails app. It's not versioned yet, but we'll be versioning it in the future. Every Backbone model is responsible for just its own data - collections are responsible for any extra data that might not belong on a specific model. Things like client-calculated values, etc.<p>- On reload, since we're shoving it out from our Rails app, we're pre-seeding with some data, but then it fires off a bunch more requests. I don't feel super strongly that this is the right way, we'll probably experiment with other options soon.<p>- We've got views/ and models/, and the structure's pretty flat inside. It runs through the Rails pipeline to minify and make a single file, which as of now isn't CDN'ed.<p>- We're not incredibly worried about secrecy for things that aren't enabled and that users can't see, since our main value prop is still server-side and under our control. We've got a global User object that we're populating with flags for what they can & can't see, and their user limitations.<p>Hope this helped, or if not, at least gave you some stuff to think about.

4180550,comment,4176075,4179894,2,0,wvenable,,,"> It IS a good thing, but it stands out when most of the language is extremely weakly-typed<p>You only need distinct operators if your language is weakly typed.  If you language is strongly typed like Python, Java, or C# then there is never any conflict between addition and concatenation.  VB/VB.NET is also weakly typed and has separate operators.<p>> So some things (objects) are passed by reference implicitly, and some (all else) are not. Yikes!<p>Yes, like most ever other language in existence.  You know, Java, C#, Python, etc.<p>> Okay. Why not at top-level?<p>Because all code should be contained within a namespace going forward.  Constants should not be defined in the top-level.<p>> if I write a function that can take either one value or an array of items, and you pass in a single object, I'll get a useless keyed array of its attributes.<p>No, it doesn't work that way.  You have to explicitly cast.  If you use an array type-hint you can only pass an array.<p>> Python and Perl are bytecode-interpreted (not positive about Ruby) and they both have rich module systems that don't require any fussing around.<p>PHP is also bytecode-interpreted.  I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make.  It's super easy to integrate code from different libraries with namespaces and autoloading.<p>> Why does it need to look like a function when it clearly isn't one? return and echo don't.<p>Because it's used an expression not a statement like return and echo.  The fact that is or is not a function is insignificant; you use it the same way.<p>> In theory, but I've never seen any actual PHP code that uses them.<p>In templates you see it all the time.<p>> That's what exception handling is for -- unfortunately, PHP errors are an entirely separate beast from PHP exceptions.<p>If you convert all errors to exceptions, you could catch it.  It's just an additional feature.  If you handle your own errors, you can even ignore the error suppression operator if you choose.<p>> I said ""PHP errors don't provide stack traces"", and you aren't disputing that...  but the runtime doesn't do it for you.<p>Oh, you're saying if you don't provide any of your own error handling and let it spill out the terminal -- yes, you're right -- no stack trace by default.  Not that you should be doing that.  If you really want that though, it can be provided by the XDebug extension.<p>> it's clearly not for compatibility with just PHP4<p>The lack of E_STRICT helps you run PHP4 code on PHP5.  That's why it's not included in E_ALL.  For example, I have an application that runs unmodified on PHP4 and PHP5.<p>> Yet I can't be sure on what parts of the language actually ARE deprecated without reading the entire manual looking for mentions of E_STRICT.<p>Turn on E_STRICT and it'll tell you.<p>> A bogus object attribute gets a warning, but a bogus class attribute is a fatal error.<p>Yes, one is defined and one is not.<p>> A string value stored in a variable can be called, but the same string value as a literal cannot.<p>Calling a string literal is pointless!  'test'() is test()!<p>> Neat, though my understanding is that this still doesn't work with fatal errors, which are shockingly common.<p>Fatal errors are not that common but I won't argue the point too heavily because they <i>are</i> a bitch.  PHP developers are trying to reduce the number of fatal errors.  Most IDE's will notify you of fatal error as you type.<p>> but that they implement half of a feature and then decide to sit down and think about the other half (while now constrained by whatever hack job they've already done).<p>There's nothing controversial or difficult about object type hinting.  Also since PHP is meant to be typeless there is some discussion over whether scalar type hints are even necessary.  Giving you something you can use right now is not a bad thing.<p>> Then why not use Class->foo? Why does this need two operators?<p>I suspect historical reasons.  They really did do very different things in PHP3/PHP4.<p>> Regardless, it's still wildly inconsistent with the rest of the language and poorly bolted on.<p>How so?  It's PHP object system, there is nothing for it to be inconsistent with in the rest of the language.<p>> How many people using PHP today came from C, exactly?<p>It's not about whether they came from C -- it's the fact that PHP quickly implemented access to a huge library of existing C libraries (and tracked their changes).  This was a <i>huge</i> deal back when PHP was younger.<p>> Zend could have merely switched the old escape function to have the new behavior, and all existing code would have been instantly fixed, not broken.<p>If you've ever complained about security in PHP, you need to give that up right now.  Because you just gave everyone a false sense of security.<p>> Either judge PHP only by the core language, or judge everything else by what you get with frameworks.<p>Wait, why?

The solution won't be a single silver bullet, but a combination of things, including efficiency (lots of low-hanging fruits there, despite all the progress we've made -- the Rocky Mountain Institute has a lot of good stuff about this).",1341028897

You have instead described something normally called the Marginal Product of Labour (MPL).  I believe the claim in the OP is to the effect that Groupon's MPL is flat or even declining and have to concur with the assessment that a high-touch business model requires huge technological support to remain competitive.<p>Indeed your own example, McDonalds, is a prime example of this.  They are not particularly notable as a human business, rather they represent a case study in very high efficiency supply chain management and process optimisation.<p>I don't disagree that a strong and skilled front line enables enduring customer relationships and opens many doors.  But the recommendation - to do so with a clear eye for efficient processes & systems - is exceedingly sound.",1341028841

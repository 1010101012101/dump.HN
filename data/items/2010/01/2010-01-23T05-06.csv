1071423,comment,1071357,1071357,0,0,richardw,,,"The article is mostly about speed, not efficiency. If you care about speed only, then many will argue it's a toss-up. If you care about efficiency over your typing lifetime, then I'd strongly suggest Dvorak has a big advantage.<p>Small slightly loaded example. Try it yourself on any body of text: I just typed your title on Dvorak and QWERTY layouts. The top line are the keys that are on the home row of each, so fingers don't have to move to type them. The second are those you have to move for. Ignores shift.<p>""debunking dvorak vs qwerty myths at reason.com""<p>Dvorak: (home row first)<p>deunindoasetthsateasono<p>bkgvrkvqwrymyr.cm<p>So in this contrived example, the home row has slightly more letters on it than other rows.<p>QWERTY: (home row first)<p>dkdakshsaas<p>ebuninvorvmyttreon.com<p>Here, the home row has far fewer of the letters required, so <i>most</i> of the time you have to move your fingers. Oh, <i>and</i> I removed QWERTY because it was just unfair. Even if you remove the 'reason.com', Dvorak is more efficient. So try it yourself for a few sentences. I suggest you'll find Dvorak has far less finger movement in most cases. Maybe someone will code up a test, scanning HN for home row keys :)<p>Is it for everyone? No. Like Sarah Palin, everyone has a different opinion. If you're happy with QWERTY, use it - there are generally far better things to learn about. Out of 4 friends who tried Dvorak, two of us kept it. I use Programmer Dvorak because it makes coding nicer, but that's even more hassle.",1264225997

1071399,comment,1071138,1071138,0,0,patio11,,,"The ex-CS drone in me winced just reading that.<p>Granted, I think we're probably getting half the story -- my experience with customers that type subject lines like ""Help! multiple nook delays and broken promises"" is that they are not always the most pain-free to deal with.  (The easiest customers to support are the ones who treat it like it is all business.  Incidentally, taking this tact has helped me with a megacorp or six over the years.)<p>However, the fact that something even remotely close to that story could happen shows broken CS policies.  At my previous employer where I was a CS drone, I could have resolved the issue on any call: ""Oh, we promised you a $100 gift card?  I'm terribly sorry you haven't received it, sir.  Can I make it up to you by issuing a $100 refund to your credit card, which will show on your bank statement within one to three business days?""  Or at ANY point in the circus they could have said ""I'm sending you a new Nook.  It will ship from our warehouse within the hour and be hand delivered by FedEx tomorrow morning.  When the first one arrives in a few days, do us a favor and just tell the delivery guy to take it back.  Don't worry about the cost: we'll cover all the charges.  We're serious about making you happy.""<p>Obviously you don't want $8 an hour CS drones making that decision too often, but you can always just trust-but-verify their judgments.  (I got flagged by the computer twice for being overly generous.  My manager came over to talk to me about it.  I said ""A customer was unhappy.  I resolved the situation."" and got a pat on my shoulder.  This was in a business with margins so thin you could shave with them, too, rather than high-end electronics which lock people into your purchasing system for life.  Crikey, you think they'd fall over themselves trying to get that in his hands.)",1264224003

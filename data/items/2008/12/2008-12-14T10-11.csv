The Nazis were <i>elected</i>, they didn't seize power in a revolution!<p>But as I always say in such discussions, you cannot evaluate history out of context. In the 20s and 30s it was perfectly normal to be what we would now consider a political extremist. It was <i>fashionable</i> be a Fascist or a Communist.  Everyone gets swept up in the zeitgeist in any era. I guarantee that the next generation will look back at us over some issue and say, <i>WTF were they thinking?!</i>",1229252087

I was a tech journalist/edit for many years. When I was at a show I spent my time talk to people at the show, yes - but also had commitments - to edit copy, handle other stories that the office was sending me and deal with other administrivia remotely.<p>Combine that with the fact that half the demos you had booked in advance to see would not have been working and yes... I can imagine having to bail from the hall. Of course, that's why we gave all the journalists cellular data cards for emergencies.",1229251504

At the first household I stayed at, they had no connectivity when I was there. Tech support put them on hold for half an hour, then said they'd send someone to fix it within two weeks.<p><i>Two weeks!</i>  Things happen on a different time-scale there. This wasn't rural France, it was in the University area of one of the major cities.  The longest I've been without Internet in the U.S in the last 3 years with roadrunner is overnight, during a thunderstorm. And things always get fixed promptly.<p>That wasn't an isolated experience either. Many French cities, always the same story. Even when the connection did work, half the time it was so slow as to be unusable.<p>I'm totally with Arrington on the overall coverage of LeWeb. The amount of hanging out, drinking beer and chatting about politics that goes on is pretty absurd (not just in France, other European countries as well). That's actually great if you have a normal job, but definitely a problem if you're trying to do a startup. Europeans need to get real before they can catch up with Silicon Valley.",1229249064

That saves each person the equivalent of thousands of USD per year. And coupled with other social insurance programs makes the gap not as high as it appears otherwise.",1229248905

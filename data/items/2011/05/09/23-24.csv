Law enforcement starts planting GPS devices directly on persons, such as in a purse, or when miniaturized further, in wallets or attached to clothing.

Those are the people the FBI would like to identify, and they're also the people least likely to be identified by a data leak like this. So, a leak of Anonymous IP addresses is really probably a leak of kids who haven't actually done much damage and a handful of Tor exit node addresses representing the people within Anonymous who know how to wreak havoc.<p>That's part of the strength of Anonymous. If there is a crackdown of any sort, it will snare a bunch of innocent (or close enough to innocent) kids, and miss all of the real targets completely.

In fact, you are not a student. We don't call them students and we don't treat them as students.<p>But watch out for an appropriate Professor! If you're lucky you don't have to do any teaching. This is usually the case for non-university research institutes like those who belong to Max-Planck, Fraunhofer or Helmholtz. At universities it depends. In some cases, TA'ing alone can be a fulltime job. Other professors see you as cheap labour and you have to do lots of work for them that you're neither qualified nor motivated to. Examples could be applying to grands, doing PR or managing the labs computer network.<p>I've lately seen many top tier professor and students from the US coming to Germany. Part of it, I think is that the government has invested a lot more money on carefully chosen projects in an effort to catch up with the US. Another reason, is that they have become a lot opener to non German speaking scientist. When I took classes two years ago, even the young Professors where all German. But recently, I hardly see a German post-doc or Professor landing a job. They are all foreigners.<p>Anyway, in my experience, the German Diploma and Doctorate Systems is perfect for people who like to learn by them self. For the Diploma, you have lots of choices after the first years and often there is only one final exam. No assignments or midterms. You can pass a class with an A* without knowing how the Prof. looks like. How you learn the required content is totally up to you. I've often chosen good American books and video lectures over the lectures here.\nAnd again, for the Dr. you can do what ever you like as long as your advisor is cool with it.<p>Actually, I found your quote quite confusing.\n""I'm just not an academic. I learn faster on my own and from a blog or lynda.com than I do from an actual course...""<p>English is not my first language but academia = higher education / research, right?\nTo me this is almost a synonym with learning and discovering on your own.<p>PS: Its all not roses and unicorns, though.

So, they told us that there is an exploit, and now it's top hax0r news, might likely feature in mainstream news.  Most sensible people will most likely hear of it, and will disable flash / plugins in chrome until someone fixes it.  Any worthy target for netspionage with any money and brain will hear about it immediately, and quit using chrome for lynx, dillo, or something even simpler.<p>Anyone who uses such a large app as a modern over-engineered web HTML5 bugzilla-feeding browser is kissing security goodbye forever.  GNU ls(1) may have security bugs FFS, do you think your browser doens't?  Do they include Chrome or Firefox in the 'pretty secure' OpenBSD base install?  No, no, they do not nor never will do this, although it is a most popular app!!  (also because nearly all *BSD boxes become servers, but you get my drift.)  Even if Chrome were regarded as an essential system service for every box to run, they would NOT include it!  better the system grind to a halt by itself without yielding access.<p>Google will redouble Chrome's general security and sandbox security in a push-patch, and this will most likely break the hack.  Or they will rediscover it.  LOL at your short-lived hack, your Government _will_ be pleased that you disrespected their payment and trust, boasting about it everywhere, putting Google and their targets on red-alert.<p>The 'secret black ops' part of Government would not only be displeased, they would kick their ass so damn hard for revealing that there is an exploit, that they would not be able to discover more exploits for years due to severe ass damage pain.<p>They pay you to learn stuff so we can do espionage or whatever fuckdoggery they might be intending at poor Arab countries to steal their oil, or suchlike...  Then this silly idiot hacker company posts 'woohoo we found an exploit, look at us: but we can't tell you how it works - 'tis just for our pals in the govt'.  Then the presumably nasty branch of govt gets out the concrete mixer and applies the concrete slippers - national borders not being much of an obstacle - then tosses the talkative hackers into the middle of the pacific trench (there's deep water there).  They are then eaten by those nasty deep-sea fish with big teeth, and lights on stalks to freak us out.<p>So anyway, this 'half-secret hack' business reeks deeply of bullshit to me.<p>For some real bullshit, forget everything else I said.  Windows is the utter pinnacle of bullshit for security, full stop.  I understand that certain few idiots among the population do use it for playing games, and watching porn, and trying to be hackers, and in offices, but seriously: if you use Windows, any edition of Windows, for your own security, you obviously have not a clue nor give a real fuck about your security at all.  Your password is probably 'dog' or 'cat'.  OS X and Linux are barely any better for security.<p>If you want real security, throw away all the public and commodity crap operating systems and build your own.  Or pay someone smart to build it.  If it takes you less than 5 years to debug it before deployment, or it's more than 100KB of code in total size, I guess you failed:  it's not secure.  I'll give you a hint.  Every process in the system should have access to precisely nothing by default.  Not even the CPU, not even the time of day.  Every single resource that is needed must be introduced to the process's environment by a neighbor or parent process (if possible, and in most cases it should not be).  The entire system, especially process / resource structure, privilege and connection must be visible as a nested, nodes-and-arcs graph, for the user / sysop to verify and check what the hell is going on in it.  If there's no link from Chrome to your printer, and you've disabled changes to that part of the process structure, Chrome will not ever print anything unless there's a solar storm - or similar stimulus - that miraculously alters everything without crashing it.  You ANTICIPATED THAT UNLIKELY EVENT, and made 3 or 4 systems running everying exactly the same, in parallel, in sync at each step.  If one screws up due to solar fuckdoggery, throw it in the bin and swap in another (like RAID).  They do this shit in planes I believe, not the swap in bit, until it lands.  The solar demons won't miraculously pseudo-break them all at once in the SAME WAY.<p>Windows, Microsoft, Security - can you spot the odd one out?\nCan you see a juxtaposition here folks?  Can you feel it?  A disturbance ripples through the force, out through the local cluster (of galaxies) and back, because those three words were collected together in one place.<p>No amount of ill-acquired M$ money spent on Windoze security enhancements can break their appallingly bad track record for security holes, loss of privacy, and the happy virus cultivation ecosystems that Microsoft has consistently provided over the years with every version of Windows, almost from before viruses were invented.  I think the first well-made and famous exploit came well before windows was conceived, I'd suggest Ken's cc hack.  That's the first brilliant exploit I happen to know about - from the vendor himself, sly bastard.  It's hard to believe he didn't go to jail for that, anyway, heh.<p>So yeah - VUPEN, Chrome, Windoze, haX0Rz working for the Big-G Government.  LOL.  Security Jokes all around.  Chrome being the more respectable and secure among them in my opinion.  And anyone who runs a nuclear reactor that depends for its stability or continued safe operation on a computer is a cow-tipping idiot too.  Cars don't even. @stuxnet @.mil",1304983965

Saying 'the timescale was just wrong' is not an adequate defense by any means. Timescale is what matters and is the essence of all predictions.<p>Ask a trader: a prediction that oil will go up in the long run is completely useless if you don't define when that event will occur, and subsequently loose everything on a big short term dip that you were blind to.<p>Additionally, if your prediction is allowed to take ""infinity"" duration to come true, then it can never be disproven. And what can't be disproven is usually categorically not worth the thought.<p>To discuss particulars, the current evidence is technology allows us to produce TOO much food TOO cheaply, which is compounded further by domestic farm subsidies. Efficiency gains are so successful in keeping up with demand, that in Mexico City they buy corn from Iowa, even though they have cheaper farmland and local labor that could be utilized.<p>Additionally, many economists are currently considering the possibility of efficiency gains being so strong a factor that they lead to structural unemployment. This picture of runaway efficiency gains is the exact <i>opposite</i> of what Malthus had envisioned (constant\linear resource utilization massively outstripped by population growth rate)<p>><i>It's sounds science fiction-ey, but I don't understand how you can see data like this and then defund NASA.</i><p>All the nations economically developed enough to have a space program are rapidly decreasing in population. China, Russia, Japan are all on the decline, the US is only increasing due to immigration. It's economics 101: wealthy people have more economic freedom to invest in birth control and their time in things other than family. Additional children switch from being an asset into a liability when you have to pay substantial amounts for them to be educated and the opportunity cost of taking time to raise a child becomes higher. The S shaped curve has been in full swing in developed countries like the US and Russia where the vast majority of the land is deserted, without anything resembling a Malthusian scenario.",1304983840

The best solution would be a separate parallel economy for intellectual works where all consumers pay an amount from the primary economy that doesn't depend on how many intellectual works they consume, but producers receive an amount that depends on how much utility consumers directly or indirectly extract from their work (in proportion to all other intellectual works).

I'm more speaking from my own experience. Most of the books I had stressed finding a library that already existed and using it for your purposes and when I showed people my early apps, there was a tendency for people to go ""why didn't you just write a drupal plugin?"", or ""why didn't you use PDO?""<p>My point wasn't that people should do those things before anything else, but that there shouldn't be as much discouragement against it in code that's being written for fun or for learning. (Obviously production code is different and in that case relying on the tried and tested code is best)",1304982513

I'm not, and furthermore I won't be tricked into some kind of reverse onus where I have to explain why it's a bad thing for the government to have this data just for the sake of having all this data. It's the other way around: The government should have to tell us, the people, why it needs this data. If it can't justify the collection of this data, it shouldn't collect it.<p>The reason why the onus is upon the government to prove why it needs the data and not on us to prove why we're entitled to some privacy is because humans have an unbroken track record for abusing information about each other, and governments even more so.

I agree that the MBA-types need to stay away from the engineers on a day-to-day basis, but I've seen too many start-ups shoot themselves in the foot because they launch a product without any market research and no understanding of how to make partnerships that will help them scale.  <p>Good luck with whatever you do next.",1183510670

32392,comment,32085,32385,0,0,andreyf,,,"Agreed, something like ""think more about tech question"", or ""think harder about innovative idea"" would have taken 10 seconds, but have been significantly more valuable to an applicant - and yes, it is courteous to do favors for someone when the effort you put into it is so dwarfed by the benefit they receive.",1183509703
32391,comment,32366,32366,0,0,blader,,,"Very nicely done implementation. It works as advertised and everything is absolutely intuitive and straight forward. I don't have much of a use case for it myself though.<p>At first, when I saw ""Friend's Documents"" and ""My Documents"", I thought this was like a native Scribd for Facebook. Which I think could be an interesting idea...",1183507645

32388,comment,32366,32366,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Overall, it's very nicely done, IMHO.  A few specifics:<p>Your dodge around facebook's ""no more than 10 invites at a time"" is clever.<p>That said, your app has the good fortune of being inherently viral -- users that want to collaborate with friends will invite those friends.  As such, I would recommend toning down the requests to users to invite their friends.  It comes off as being too pushy (to me).<p>It's quite plain-looking, which is normal for a word-processing application but out of place for a Facebook application.  I would err on the side of fitting in with your context -- add more icons next to functions, etc.<p>Congrats and good luck!",1183507341

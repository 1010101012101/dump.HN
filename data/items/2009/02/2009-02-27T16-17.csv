The idea is that you should be able to set the price of your music, but there's quite a bit of weirdness and technical issues. For example, I'm selling an album I recorded on Amazon. It's a full-length, so you'd expect something like ~$9.99 to be the final price, but since it's only one track (21 minutes long), it ended up going for 99 cents at Amazon. I have no doubt that somewhere  on the internet exists a form where I can edit the price, but it'd be a real pain to deal with. I'm glad selling music on Amazon/iTunes is a hobby of mine and not a business.",1235753939

He has a hunch, like any entrepreneur, that there is a market for his music if only more people were exposed to it.<p>Sure he could pay Google lots of money for click-throughs to his e-commerce site, but that wouldn't be any fun.<p>So in comes the idea of using RSS.  I admit, I've noticed that a lot of companies have a business model like:<p>1) Idea
2) RSS
3) ?
4) Profit<p>Zed is reinventing the wheel... the traditional music industry exists <i>not because it is evil</i> but because it helps match musicians with consumers who happily buy the music.<p>Consider all the music fandom lore about waiting in line to buy an album, etc.  People love making the purchase, they love the cover art, they love the unauthorized leak of a track before the album's official release date, etc.  These things are part of the larger entertainment and social value of music.<p>So Zed wants to reinvent the wheel, with the help of RSS, to get all the clueless people, clods, and scammers out of the way so that people will discover his own music and the music of other tortured artists.<p>The real question to ask is to the consumer:  ""Do you have a music problem?""  I personally do not.  There is a lot of great stuff on iTunes, Pandora, etc., and I have maxed out the amount of leisure time and money I want to spend on music enjoyment.<p>In economic terms, the marginal cost of discovering another great artist is extremely low, effectively nil.  I know where to go, I can afford the price of the album, etc.  The reason I don't buy more music is because I don't care to.  There is tremendous abundance and quality.<p>So to make a persuasive argument from the perspective of a consumer, Zed would have to argue that there are lots of artists who (if discovered) would make music listeners significantly happier, or would save them significant amounts of money, or both.<p>Zed's music-themed rants sort of remind me of an infomercial.",1235753841

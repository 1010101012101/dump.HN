I&#x27;ve developed an appreciation for it even if I didn&#x27;t take CS in college (I took the redheaded bastard stepchild major of CIS).<p>quanticle is suggesting there is a purposeful, formal means of discussing and identifying performance, irrespective of how it&#x27;s measured/profiled or addressed.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub:  why don&#x27;t job openings eliminate the other requirements and just put Big-O (and a language) as the two must have items on the list.

However, basically, anything people agree to value can function as an asset to be traded as nationally issued fiat-currency (debt) is today. There&#x27;s essentially no difference, though the latter has the historical benefit of being demanded as tax and supporting by a large army, theoretically though the governments cannot wield these against the hippy next door for, you know, growing trees (environmental credits) or sharing spliffs (social credits).<p>People wanting the currency (debt) is based upon trust; ie. the trust that the debt society owes you, symbolized in the form of your possession of the asset in question, will be redeemed at some future point by someone else for something you want. (Note that due to inflation and the creation of money in current era systems this debt notion is flipped; typical money must be repaid - with interest, at speed - or forfeited. But that&#x27;s a tangent.)<p>A path forward will probably include convincing one or more governments to adopt some alternate assets and begin to effectively provide rates of exchange through government tax incentives or similar. This could kickstart a modern renaissance in multi-asset accounting and localized economies. Not holding my breath on speed, but anything&#x27;s possible. Part of the challenge here is that social and environmental concerns typically cross borders and election terms, and developed countries&#x27; political decisionmaking is heavily blinkered against these two classes of issue.<p>Recommended reading: <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i>.",1379318282

In fact, we could unilaterally disarm and suffer absolutely no increase in risk from China for the very obvious reason that they are not going to nuke their biggest market.<p>Nor are nuclear weapons needed to keep the peace with Russia, which is a shadow of what it was as the Soviet Empire. Indeed, even then their primary concern was containing the American threat. As far as the arms race is concerned, that was very much something America started. It took several years for the Soviets to join, and several more for them to even try to match us, which they never came close to doing. Unlike the Space Race, where we were playing catch up, the arms race was one in which we were ahead, by a very wide margin, from the very beginning. They were responding to our lead. We were not responding to theirs.<p>I know Americans don&#x27;t like to think of themselves as the belligerent party, but in the case of nuclear weapons pointed at the USSR, we really were. Even the Cuban missile crisis, which we like to think of as an unprovoked escalation, was a direct response to our own truly unprovoked escalation (placing missiles in Turkey aimed at Moscow). Having seen the error of our ways (well, sort of) and more importantly, having seen the Soviet Union collapse entirely, we can safely dismantle our arsenal, knowing full well that the biggest threat to world peace following WW2 was always us.<p>Indeed, having first gotten rid of our own, we could help the increasingly impoverished Russians make the world safer by helping them get rid of theirs. The truth is that we were the ones who brought the scourge of nuclear weapons upon the world. We were the ones who sparked the Arms Race. And we remain the only country to have used them in combat. Frankly, leading efforts to rid the world of these things is the least we can do.<p>Clinging to outdated and conspicuously unworkable &quot;balance of power&quot; arrangements simply isn&#x27;t in our interests. And having removed the biggest threat from the table, without demands for reciprocity, we not only project massive confidence, we also make others look foolish by fearfully and pointlessly holding onto theirs.

Uniform is just a really common prior to choose in this situation for a few reasons:<p>-It&#x27;s a special case of the beta distribution, which is the conjugate prior for binomial problems. This means that the distribution of the probability of getting heads given the coin flips is in the same family as the prior itself (ie: beta priors with binomial likelihoods yield beta posteriors).<p>-The uniform (for this problem at least) is an &quot;objective prior&quot;, which expresses that we don&#x27;t have much information about whether the flip is biased. The example you give (modeling p^2 instead of p) is a great example of when the uniform would be a bad choice. The reason the uniform doesn&#x27;t work in this case is because for binomial data (coin flips), a uniform prior is not invariant to reparametrization.<p>If choosing priors was so simple as always going with the uniform, there&#x27;d be little reason to go with Bayes! The choice of prior sometimes makes a radical difference in the posterior (especially with small samples), and there&#x27;s many things to consider when you choose priors (computational convenience, uninformative versus informative priors, hierarchical modeling, etc).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior</a>

If you transform, the browser lifts the transformed rectangle into its own layer and renders its content to a texture. Then, later, it is composited with the page by blitting that texture with whatever transformation was applied.<p>So CSS transforms are an application of texturing. And in texturing what you do to avoid aliasing is mipmapping (you might also throw anisotropic filtering on top). However as the texture holding the rect the browser rendered isn&#x27;t square power of two, some devices do not support mipmapping it. It is also quite slow to generate the mipmap for a texture every frame.<p>So with CSS transforms not being able to utilize mipmapping --> aliasing.<p>Now, in particular mipmapping text (that&#x27;s supposed to be sharp) isn&#x27;t even the best idea. It just gets blurry and looks unappealing (although that&#x27;s better with anisotropic filtering, but then, anisotropic filtering is also expensive and not every device/GPU supports it).",1379317259

I know when you move in, the city gives you a set of Potassium iodide pills. They tell you to ingest them if you hear the firemen&#x27;s horn 9 times straight.<p>Good thing is that there are way more water/plants/animal testing for radiation close to nuclear plants than others. 
So you actually are quite sure to eat healthier than in more remote areas with less controls.<p>Last risk is explosion/fission/big problem.

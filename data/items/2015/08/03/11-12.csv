But looking at our soundbite-rich politicians I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say politics has got more human as it&#x27;s become more media-savvy.<p>I remember reading an article about party political broadcasts in the Uk a couple of decades ago, and the chief media person for the Conservative party genuinely wanted to throw away 4mins30 seconds of their allocated 5 minutes broadcast and just have a 30 second advert. They thought that would be more effective, but election rules forbid it so they had to go with the full 5 mins.",1438603152

I don&#x27;t, however, think it&#x27;s going to come as an obvious social networking site.<p>Let&#x27;s back up a bit to what Facebook was in its nascent days: a place to go and see what others were doing.  The quality of the content was high relative to what the users wanted.  Someone else here on HN posted within the last week or so a link to Reed&#x27;s Law (Reed&#x27;s homepage: <a href=""http://www.reed.com/dpr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reed.com/dpr/</a>) which basically outlines how social networking groups become more useful.  So, the question that someone is going to have to answer to beat Facebook is, &#x27;How can I create something that is providing a large number of people with higher quality content than Facebook?&#x27;<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s going to be a Trojan Horse (in the historical sense, not the malicious program sense) that does this.  Something that allows users to join (probably using their Facebook account to log in and register), and then facilitates sharing high quality information with others.  The first iteration may not be an obvious threat to Facebook, but it&#x27;s coming.  I honestly believe it&#x27;s going to come from the healthcare space, and probably in about 10 years.  Full disclosure: I applied to the YC Fellowship with an idea of how to do this from healthcare, although it&#x27;s not as obvious from the application, that&#x27;s the end goal.",1438602994

Although it&#x27;s very hard to quantify, I feel as though these people are very disassociated from the everyday life the claim to be studying. If you live near Harvard earning ~300k a year, how easy is it to imagine (pretend?) that everything is fine and that the skewed income distribution is actually a positive thing. Boiled down - can people who are part of such a skewed system really produce unbiased studies and theories about the system?<p>They back up their claims with various arguments as to the nature of the average consumer and echoes and remnants of trickle-down economics theories.<p>Why don&#x27;t people instead look at the actual world for more accurate evidence? The U.S. is a pioneer of creating highly divided cultures, with the top 1% earning ridiculous amounts of money and living in relative luxury, while having a very large population of people struggling to make ends meet, or even get healthcare due to the associated costs.<p>At the same time, countries exercising a highly socialistic economic policy (welfare countries), such as the Nordics and Germany to some extent have a far higher &quot;average&quot; quality of life, as well as (arguably) a happier population. Being a taxi driver in Norway or Denmark doesn&#x27;t mean you live in near-poverty and have to work 80 hours a week to make ends meet.<p>While I&#x27;ll try to not get into details of economic theory, and so forth, one question that has always irked me is the following:<p>Does the evidence not speak for itself? In what country has pure capitalism (or at least as close as we can get), actually worked to produce a happy and harmonious society?",1438602831

That&#x27;s not just &quot;TV&quot;. And &quot;TV&quot; isn&#x27;t just video.<p>We&#x27;ve only recently entered the era where users can reasonably make live and recorded video, and use that as a form of expression (from video chat, to youtube/vimeo to snapchat etc). And just like you could take a tv camera and use that for video conferencing in the 60s[1] -- video-the-medium is much more than &quot;TV&quot;.<p>&quot;TV&quot; is indeed very pacifying. For myself, I can on days off, do two very different things that are very <i>immersive</i>: watch tv series, or play Star Wars: Online Galaxies. Now, I mostly play SWTOR solo, so for the purpose of this discussion, lets just use &quot;play a single-player computer game&quot;. I enjoy both, but if I read a book or play a computer game -- I&#x27;m mentally <i>invigorated</i>. If I watch a TV series, even something interesting like &quot;Humans&quot;[h], &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;[r] -- or more interesting drama like &quot;True Detective&quot;[t] -- I always end up more passive. Even watching documentaries, or news -- TV ends up a very passive medium.<p>And that&#x27;s (IMNHO) just the <i>good</i> &quot;TV&quot;. I find that a good movie is usually between &quot;book&quot; and &quot;TV&quot; -- something with the format/runtime that drives a different expression both in writing and directing.<p>> We&#x27;ve been trending away from the &#x27;web as a collection of books&#x27; to &#x27;the web as a series of TV channels&#x27; for many years now.<p>I don&#x27;t think the web has ever been much like a &quot;collection of books&quot;. It might have been &quot;a collection of essays&quot; -- and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re really trending towards &quot;a series of TV channels&quot;. I think we&#x27;ll still see video expression and communication evolve, and I think user generated communiques (&quot;content&quot; is more something that oozes from a (corporate) organization) will continue to dominate.<p>It is my impression that young people (~3-20) are much more inclined to use video than I am -- I don&#x27;t much like it. But I expect rich media images/sound/video will continue to increase, as bandwidth/storage gets cheaper.<p>I think that trend in media is different from the trend in centralization, commercialization though. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with videologs (other than that <i>I</i> prefer a well-written text...) -- as long as we can host them in a more distributed manner than we do today.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see interesting times ahead, as the people that are now 5 years old grow up to master both rich media and various forms of programming/automation as a natural part of their life.

9995047,comment,9994653,9994958,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ya know, I can&#x27;t help but think of MTV. Back in the late &#x27;70s all of the radio stations in the US were turning corporate, being bought up by chains and switching to boring, top 40s styles, playing the same songs all the time in order to rack up the ad revenue. MTV was launched at this same time but when it hit the air it had a problem, most songs didn&#x27;t have music videos. So they ended up playing a lot of songs they wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise, and accidentally played an eclectic mix of music. Which was like a breath of fresh air to the youth of the day, who had been abandoned by radio. MTV became hugely popular and helped gain popularity for a wide variety of different music that might not have become nearly as popular otherwise.<p>In general, corporate interests will result in less risk taking and thus less diversity and less eccentric content. You see the same thing in hollywood, where there is massive risk aversion.<p>Which reminds me of the Space Shuttle. People thought that the Shuttle was well tested near the end of its run of 130-odd flights, but it really wasn&#x27;t. Because those were operational flights, not test flights, every single one of them attempted to stay as much in the center of the performance envelope as possible. So the performance envelope of the Shuttle was not actually well known, despite having flown over 100 flights. The vast majority of content producers who rely on ad revenue make the same estimations about risk, and try to stay away from the edges of the &quot;risk envelope&quot; for profitable content, with obvious implications for diversity and quality. The only real solution is to greater enable individual content creation. In some respects the modern web is great at that, but for content such as existed back when the web was young and weird it is less so.",1438602326

9995016,comment,9994653,9994653,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This deserves a much longer reply than this, but it&#x27;ll have to do for now. There&#x27;s very much a different tone and structure to content on the internet today than when it was younger. Much of that has been a transition toward more commercial content and more &quot;bite-sized&quot; content, a lot of which has been encouraged by the tools we&#x27;ve come to use to interact with the internet. Social networks, mobile devices, etc. Each of which reward or encourage a shallower level of interaction on shorter timescales. I remember using usenet and forums where a conversation would typically last for days and sometimes for weeks or months. And where it wasn&#x27;t unusual for a single reply to be several paragraphs of text and perhaps have involved several hours of work and/or research on the part of the poster. And on the web there was much that was similar. Blogs and personal sites full of essays. Blogs having conversations with one another via essay, and so on.<p>That sort of thing still exists in pockets here and there but it does seem much less common. And it doesn&#x27;t feel as though the younger generations coming online have a predilection toward that mode of communicating. And too all of the communications tools we use from day to day tend to discourage such individualistic content. There&#x27;s a sharper dichotomy between content producer and content consumer than there used to be. But you see people chaffing at the separation. You see people posting 20 part tweets, or posting an essay in image form to their facebook wall.<p>I don&#x27;t fear that individualistic content will disappear from the web, but I fear that it is becoming less common, and is being actively discouraged by the tools and platforms we&#x27;ve come to rely on. Part of it comes back to the ad supported nature of much of the web. Just as in all other ad supported media to date there&#x27;s always a pressure towards shallowness and laziness. Shallow content is cheaper and easier to make, and when you&#x27;re just counting eyeballs it&#x27;s often seemingly just as profitable.",1438601606

Remember back when people would live-stream their entire lives? Not necessarily to be a eyeball-grabber, but just because they wanted to live in the open.

We would hook up our computers to each other, open up the pipes, and the free exchange of honest information would result in Good Things Happening (tm). We never were really told what all these good things would be. I suppose it meant more free people in the world, or rapid advancement of the sciences, or more folks becoming friends.<p>Instead it&#x27;s countries building great firewalls, science publishers holding on to their data and using the legal system to enforce it -- and more little niches where like-minded people talk to each other in an echo room.<p>Web pages, which were just one way of many to go see printed content that somebody had stored, have turned into some weird kind of real-estate. Long gone from most toolkits are Gopher, Telnet, FTP, and the rest. Instead, everything is a web page. Long gone are people owning their own computers, which amazes me to no end.

An exception is Terry Davis: He actually wrote his own operating system. We have tried TempleOS and balanced on the narrow line between genius and crazy.<p>Terry Davis is in a many English language computer fora a long time persona-non-grata. He is not the classical troll that wants to provoke, he&#x27;s more likely to mix the technical background with the goal of being a Christian Missionary to the IT world. That would normally be an internet footnote. But Davis has actually done that which others only talk about: In the last twelve years he has written his own operating system. Not just the kernel, not for some (fictuous) microprocessor in the old style but a 64 bit operating system for modern day Intel and AMD processors, including a C-Dialect, a compiler, a command shell, editor and applications as well as games. In March 2015 he released version 3.04, we took a look at &#x27;Gods operating system&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s Davis&#x27; own name for his operating system - he is very religious and takes his TempleOS as handed down from God. This also goes for a series of technical rewards and &#x27;godly&#x27; improvements on the hardware, the software and their development.  Quite a few things are strnage - such as the pronounciation that a grapic resolution of 640x480 pixels with 16 colors is eough and that hardware upgrades should occur on a 49 year schedule. Other improvements such as the removal of Microsofts secure boot and a dedicated reset button on a computer will find a lot of supporters.<p>Davis has learned how to write computer programs close to the metal and has done so professionally. His change in the religious direction started when his schizophrenia went untreated. At the same time this gave him the required motivation to write TempleOS for so long on his own. A detailed and readworthy biography about his professional career, his schizophrenia and his religion was published in Vice magazine in the fall of the previous year.<p>The first steps with TempleOS are no different than those with other operating systems. The rituals are the same. That is: an ISO file is downloaded and burned to a CD - or connected to a virtual machine. The user can choose between a minimal and a complete distribution. Since the latter is only 17MB large being a scrooge is not going to pay off in this case.<p>The CD image is also a Live-CD. It takes only a very short time to start the OS from the CD. We were expecting the terminal screen and the ASSCII-look, but not the blinking and scrolling window titles. To head this off at the pass: the blining is very disturbing in the first few minutes but with some time the brain edits them out, and after a while the information contained in there actually is useful. More by coincidence we noticed the thin mouse pointer in the middle of the screen, which tracks the movements of our USB mouse. We move the mousepointer over the windowborder of the smallest of the three windows, it is the autocomplete, as we learn later. Intuitively we click on the windowframe and keep the mousebutton pressed. That allows us to move the frame around. We try to click the large &#x27;X&#x27; in the corner and as expected the window closes.<p>That&#x27;s how the user of TempleOS is greeted. All the terminal windows are freely re-arrangeable.<p>The rest of the windows are classical terminal windows with a command line. In the left window we have an offer to install the system on the harddisk and to do a tutorial. We decide against that and want to first work a bit more on the command line.<p>We type &#x27;dir&#x27; and press enter, nothing happens. We type &#x27;ls&#x27; and press enter. This gives us a compiler warning about an unknown identifier. You read that right: no complaint about an unknown program, but actually a compiler error. The command line of TempleOS has been equipped with a C-Compiler. It is to make it precise not the original &#x27;C&#x27;, but Davis&#x27; own C-dialect called &#x27;HolyC&#x27;. More about that later. Installation requires more knowledge.<p>Before we go further explore the system, we&#x27;d like to install it from the Live-CD. We don&#x27;t need a license key, TempleOS is public domain and open source. Davis advises explicitly to do the installation either as dual boot or in a VM. Even though TempleOS is a complete and stand-alone operating system, for the most part it is understood to be a platform for education and experimenting. We took an older computer and let TempleOS take over the machine, removing the previous installation of windows completely.<p>Because we broke off the installation and because we do not yet know how to restart the installation process we chose to hard-reset the computer. The boot time is so short that this is an entirely painless way to get back. This time we don&#x27;t end the installation script, but we confirm our desire to install. The script runs through a series of programs that could have been started manually as well.<p>The installation is definitely not a trivial affair. We have to partition the hard drive and put the Red-Sea-filesystem of TempleOS on it. The order and the numbers entered for the partition data reminds of Linux in the early days. That we&#x27;re not talking about Linux is clear when the system talks about drive names such as &#x27;C&#x27;.<p>After arranging the harddrive the contents of the Live-CD are copied to the harddrive and after that a custom bootloader. TempleOS can be used with Grub as well. When using the TempleOS bootloader the system will save the original master boot record (MBR).<p>Finally we take out the CD, and using a hard-reset force another restart. We land in the bootmenu. Which gives us the choice to start TempleOS or to restore the old MBR. Of course we start TempleOS.<p>-- Lots more, but this gives you a good indication.",1438600533

There wasn&#x27;t much content, it was all generally high quality, the discovery process worked well as a result, and few people were monetising it.<p>Now we have to ask an awkward question: do people actually <i>want</i> quality, as we define it?

If we attribute ALL of the deaths to traffic stops to get an upper bound of 3.5 deaths per 100k for people in traffic stops per year.<p>That puts the probability of getting killed during a traffic stop in a given year at about the same as the probability of dying that year from stomach cancer. It&#x27;s about half the probability of dying by suicide from firearm, and 3 times the probability of dying by influenza.<p>That&#x27;s a very generous upper bound. Only 2% of the descriptions at Wikipedia mention traffic, but that is too low because some do not have descriptions.

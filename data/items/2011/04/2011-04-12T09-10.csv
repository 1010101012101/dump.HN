As he put it: ""I did stand-up comedy for eighteen years. Ten of those years were spent learning, four years were spent refining, and four were spent in wild success.""<p>P.S. Born Standing Up, his memoir, is deservedly praised.",1302602314

People who post comments are still going to get karma for upvotes.<p><i>""I didn't think the goal was to remove the social benefits that come from crowd sourcing.""</i><p>Comments which get more upvotes still tend to drift to the top of the screen over time.  So there is still some indication of which comments probably got more upvotes (they're the ones near the top of the screen).<p>Whether that's really much of a benefit or not to revealing a given comment's upvotes is debatable.  Apart from some really trollish or contentless comments, I don't think the number of votes on comments is particularly indicative of their quality.<p>As pg stated in the original thread which motivated the change to hiding the upvotes for comments:<p><i>""The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.""</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>Hiding the upvotes that comments get reduces the tendency of people to vote with the herd.  It also gets people to read more comments and read them more carefully.<p>I think overall this is an improvement, but not an unqualified one (for reasons discussed elsewhere in this thread and others).  As I've stated elsewhere, it might be further improved by revealing the number of votes a given comment has gotten to each user who votes on that comment only after they've voted on it.  That will encourage voting and still discourage voting with the herd.",1302602151

As the intelligence level decreases the ability for this group to filter for the conversations previously highly voted decreases. More intelligent people filter for more intelligent stories and comments. (Is reddit a worse community? No. Does it have a different audience? Yes. That is what is happening here.)<p>I know this is an offensive idea, but you simply have to decide whether to cater for the elites or the lowest common denominator. As time progresses the people just joining now will look back on this time as a golden age of HN -- it will get worse -- and in the future there will be a new wave of lower intelligence HN'ers. That is how it always is.<p>The solution I would prefer is (1) allowing users to curate their own experience with far greater granularity than allowed on a site such as Reddit. That is, use twitter like ideas of followers and lists. Allow us to choose who we see comments and stories from. I care about the votes from these people much more than somebody who just joined a couple of weeks ago and hasn't programmed or owned a startup company. (2) giving users with popularity in the community, moderation power similar to the kind found on StackOverflow. The power to close topics. Respond to bad usages of the vote button. Respond to flags. Perhaps even the power to moderate comments.",1302601871

2436527,comment,2434334,2434334,2,0,ignifero,,,"That is an awesome writeup, wildbunny. We all suffer with facebook's temperamental platform. There are a couple points i would add actually:<p>- At this point it's impossible to maintain virality without using ""game dynamics"", i.e. some sort of manipulative tricks that will persuade users to post things to their wall. Unfortunately, this is only possible for game apps (and is something zynga has perfected). It <i>IS</i> still possible to maintain virality, but you also need to complement it with advertising.<p>- There are bugs in facebook's bugzilla that have been lurking for years. Facebook tends to push buggy  code at least every week,; sometimes bugs make apps unusable for days.<p>- Accidents happen more often than not. Last month, facebook removed 50000 of our users from our game for one day.<p>- Adsense is the best advertising solution, not just because the payouts are 2-5 times higher, but also because the ads are safer and more useful. Since we switched to their ""approved"" advertisers, we have been receiving reports about malware ads. Unfortunately, their nonsensical terms are designed so that only small advertising shops would be willing to participate.<p>The overall experience has been good, but lately it's getting insufferable. It's odd that facebook has chosen to monetize its platform from facebook credits at the lowpoint of the platform. We have already put our games on maintainance mode, and embarked on other endeavors",1302601745

2436482,comment,2436261,2436261,1,0,gexla,,,"I'm not sure how this would work.  Perhaps you would first need to define the term ""regular employee.""  In the U.S. the best way to define a regular employee is by the tax form.  Generally a regular employee is considered a W-2 which means you have to do things such as pay into that employees social security (and other social programs) among other things.  If your employee isn't a W-2 then he/she is generally a contractor.<p>Since an Indian citizen doesn't live in the U.S. then none of these sorts of laws apply.  So, from the U.S. perspective, you would simply be a contractor and your services would be a tax write-off.<p>You specifically mentioned you aren't asking about companies which have a business in India, so that's out.<p>Conclusion:  I don't know about Europe but I imagine it's the same as the U.S.  Because you don't live in the U.S. you will always be a contractor and the only tax / legal implications is that payments towards your services are a write-off.  You would be a regular employee in name only.  You wouldn't necessarily receive any of the benefits that typically go along with the status of ""regular employee.""",1302600305

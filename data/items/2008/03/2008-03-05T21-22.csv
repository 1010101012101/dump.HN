130019,comment,130008,130010,0,0,whyleyc,,,"I really like the colour scheme of the new homepage/site, but have a few observations:<p>(1) It's not immediately obvious to me what Fuzzwich is and why I should use it - I really think you could benefit from a prominently positioned tagline on the page itself (""Animation for Everyone"" is good, but why put it only in the title bar ?)<p>(2) If your new screencast is a big play you definitely need to sell it more on your homepage - bigger or bold font / more prominence would help<p>(3) What's with the (wasted ?) space to the left-middle of the page ? This could be put to good use with a big SIGNUP NOW ! style button or maybe a funky image to sell the screencast with.<p>Just my two pennyworth - Hope some of it helps. You have a cool product - As pg says ""Don't give up"" :-)",1204752246

9427361,comment,9426765,9426765,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Academia fucked up by copping an attitude toward the most important, but least glamorous, aspect of the job: teaching. In the 1960s, the U.S. had a strong research culture. Unfortunately, the professoriate took the attitude that research was their real work and that teaching was just grunt work to be sloughed off to the people at the bottom of the heap (graduate students and juniors). Eventually, they turned that work over to low-paid adjunct faculty, occasionally taking on an upper-level undergraduate course.<p>Teaching is important for a number of reasons, but it also functions as a sales front for research. Research is important, but only educated people can see its importance. If 40% of the next generation&#x27;s leaders learn calculus and 5% learn complex analysis, then they&#x27;ll have an appreciation for the beauty of mathematics and an understanding of its importance. However, if they&#x27;re taught by overworked, underpaid adjuncts who&#x27;ve lost all enthusiasm for the subject, then the rising generation will lose sight of why the work is importat.<p>This is, of course, bad for science but even worse for the humanities, where the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next (i.e. teaching) is almost the entire point, because commercial applications are nonexistent. I won&#x27;t call most humanities research unimportant, because I don&#x27;t understand most of it, but I will say that if you have a leadership class as ignorant of the humanities as the American upper and upper-middle classes are, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time selling anyone on the importance of it. Most people are quick to decry what they don&#x27;t understand as useless and unnecessary.<p>When the research rock stars started de-emphasizing teaching and offloading the work, the rest of society (including university administrators) called their bluff. If they were so ready to slough off the teaching (which is what most of the world sees as the real work) to overworked adjuncts, then why have professors at all? Of course, a few politically adept stars (grant-writing rain-makers) managed to hold on... but the quiet researchers are done.<p>The injustice of the tenure system is that the people to suffer for this attitude were the young-- not the entrenched tenured professors who created that culture. The jobs got taken away, but not from the people who copped that negative attitude toward teaching. It was the rising generation (from 1985-ish to today) that got fucked. At this point, you have a toxic culture of scarcity and the false poverty mentality (i.e. the &quot;I&#x27;m 75% poorer than my friends, so I&#x27;m living a life of service and the rules don&#x27;t apply to me&quot; attitude).",1429802957

Every major bank has SEVERAL of them. Deter much? Absolutely not. Here&#x27;s what a recent editorial in the Financial Times had to say about this [1]:<p>In the US, the most blatant expression of the failure to rein in the financial industry is the use of deferred prosecution agreements. These are deals which, despite sufficient evidence for criminal prosecutions, allow wrongdoers to pay fines and make commitments to improved conduct in return for avoiding the admission of criminal guilt.<p>In an important speech last Wednesday, US Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the widespread use of DPAs against financial industry lawbreakers. Her main argument is that DPAs’ main punitive tool — fines — have far too little deterrent effect. A fine paid by a corporation is essentially a raid on its shareholders’ funds. What is more, the lag from the commission of a financial crime to the implementation of a DPA is long. Both mean that even huge fines (some have been in the billions) are highly unlikely to make much difference to the economic prospects of the responsible individuals when they decide whether or not to break the law.<p>To put it simply, too many get away with cheating. Criminal prosecutions would stand a better chance of holding culpable individuals to account — and therefore to discourage wrongdoing in the first place. Deterrence aside, there is also an important democratic value in lawbreakers being publicly branded as such.<p>So Ms Warren is right. DPAs, originally intended to deal with low-stake crimes with little chance of repetition, have become a blight on a financial sector that has proved capable of crimes that are neither low-stake nor one-off.<p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f26a9acc-e515-11e4-a02d-00144feab7de.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f26a9acc-e515-11e4-a02d-00144feab7...</a>",1429802890

For us it didn&#x27;t matter so much since our target audience was new comp sci students at a school where the starting and most used language was Java.<p>Our other restriction was that we wanted to support hundreds of units per team, and we wanted tens of thousands of computed turns, but be able to compute that within 3-5 minutes.<p>We did learn from that naive approach though and the next year I believe it was done with a text based API. If performance were an issue, it could be done with protobuffers, since most popular languages have at least some implementation of them. The year we did the java implementation we had replays the size of 250mb+ due to how much data we had, even with deltas, compression, and other pruning. The text API was only feasible due to a massive reduction in the amount of game entities and turns.<p>The key thing was when you want to offer API commands. We wanted starting freshman to be able to compete, and that required offering things like pathfinding, predefined list filters, etc. This also mattered since it was run like TopCoder where they only knew about the game the day of the competition and had 8 hours to code an AI for it. The least buggy way to support that in multiple languages is to have the API computation happen on the server, then your language specific APIs are just wrappers around the API calls and data and much easier to change as your game changes.",1429802008

What I did is test up to date devices (i think i even tested an up to date iOS 6) and couldn&#x27;t get any specific SSID. The probe requests were still there, but SSID parameter was always set to Broadcast.<p>However I did see a lots of probe requests WITH a SSID parameter set but those were not coming from my devices :). I assumed they were not up to date.<p>I am very interested to know if the probe requests you&#x27;re seeing are also coming from unknown devices: if they aren&#x27;t, could you provide us with the iOS version you&#x27;re using/testing with?",1429801473

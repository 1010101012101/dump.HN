While I realize that they are experiencing some real stress, and yeah, it should get fixed, I think they&#x27;re blind to Twitter&#x27;s real problem.<p>Simply put: twitter is, for those without an audience, a strictly one-way medium.  There is no social network or medium that is less interactive to the relatively anonymous, save perhaps a standalone blog.  You&#x27;re shouting into the vacuum, which is disheartening and eventually people just stop and eat their tweets.<p>The opposite of love is total indifference.<p>I would argue that twitter is actively encouraging this one-way-ness, which is going to be their downfall, because Twitter as a feed aggregator is high-noise and feature-poor.  All of my &quot;suggested friends&quot; on Facebook (who got this right) are people who might reasonably care about anything I have to say.  All of my suggested follows on Twitter are people who could not give one single fuck.  (It&#x27;s ok, I forgive you just this once Elon Musk.  I&#x27;m not tearing your poster off my wall or anything.  Although you&#x27;re missing out on a goldmine here.)<p>It is a shame, because yet another news aggregator is <i>highly</i> unnecessary at this point in time, but number of two-sided social networks of Twitter&#x27;s scope you could count on the fingers of one hand.",1446839972

10521607,comment,10516775,10521421,0,0,saosebastiao,,,"I think the aircraft has only a tiny effect on profitability. In general, aircraft total cost of ownership and operations is proportional to size. There are some outliers, but the purchase price and/or leasing costs are negotiated up or down based off of perception of costs, so if there are any issues with aircraft costs they are short lived and go away after a while because those cost differences are eventually negotiated away. Similarly, any aircraft with lower than normal operational costs will have its price bid up until it breaks even with the cost levels of inferior aircraft (scarcity of production capacity for aircraft ensures that higher bidders get first dibs).<p>The real issue is flight capacity utilization. Airline cost structures follow what accountants would call a step-fixed cost. In other words, the marginal cost per person is negligible until you fill the aircraft and then the marginal cost per person is the cost of a whole new flight. This also means that once you fill a plane past its break-even load factor, <i>every additional seat sold is pure profit</i>.<p>The airline industry as a whole is operating on load factors between 82% and 84%, and it is net neutral in terms of profitability. That would lead me to believe that at current fuel prices (really the only source of variability in operational cost), that 83% load factors represent the zero-profit scenario. Now if Airline A can achieve 85% load factors, they will have a positive EBIT. If Airline B can acheive 87% load factors, they will roughly double the EBIT of Airline A.<p>Some airlines make money. They do it using the same exact planes and technology as other airlines that do not make money. The difference is that they have higher load factors. They are better at selling seats.",1446839792

If you take a 747-400, 757, 737, and a CRJ (1 fuel stop) move a full load of passengers 3000 miles the widebodies will have better seat/mile costs.  That chart compares the seat/mile of a 737 going 1000 miles to a 747 going 6000 miles.

A price differential as low as $5 is enough to get people to switch flights, even if the pricier flight is better. It&#x27;s utterly cut-throat.<p>Why do airlines cram people in so tightly you can barely breathe? Because that lets them shave dollars off the ticket price, which attracts customers from anyone who doesn&#x27;t do this. Given the choice between a cheaper flight that&#x27;s less comfortable, or one that&#x27;s $5 more and has more room, people will choose the former.<p>Why do airlines not serve meals anymore unless they absolutely have to? Well, those meals aren&#x27;t free. People will choose the meal-less flight for $5 less over the flight with a meal that costs slightly more.<p>Why does everybody charge for checked luggage now? Because it lets them shave the price of a ticket.<p>If people wanted comfort, good food, free luggage, and all that, we would have it.

That is to say, I think 44.1kHz 16-bit PCM audio is plenty good and I&#x27;m in no rush to replace my CD collection, nor do I think significant investment in higher bandwidth audio (for playback, mixing and mastering are another story) buys you much.<p>That said, there&#x27;s one thing the article does not address and that is &quot;beating&quot;, or really inter-modulation distortion from instrumental overtones.<p>Instruments are not limited to 20-20kHz.  They can have overtones well above this range. Additionally, note that short pulse-width signals, i.e. transients, like drum strikes, especially involving wooden percussion, can have infinite bandwidth. (Not really infinite, but pulse-width is inversely proportional to bandwidth.<p>In a real listening environment (i.e. live performance) these overtones have a chance to interact with one another in the air.  It is possible that these overtones may beat with one another and cause inter-modulation products in the audible range.  For an example of this, play a 1000 Hz tone through your left speaker, and a 1001 Hz through your right speaker.  You will hear a distinct 1 Hz &quot;beat&quot;.  The audibility of these are largely dependent on listening position and amplitude, but it is possible to occur with instruments.  Since most recordings are done using a &quot;close mic&quot; technique (placing the microphone very close to the source) the interactions such as this are never recorded.<p>However, if full bandwidth of the producing instruments is preserved, these interactions of the overtones can be reproduced in a playback environment given equipment having a wide enough bandwidth and degree of quality.",1446838803

But to my knowledge airlines don&#x27;t really participate in the ground concession profit stream... airports do, but not airlines.  Yet, all these inefficient, unprofitable airlines care about is moving currency around quickly.  All of this is spite of the customers. And this is Capitalism.<p>Sorry to say I have to disagree.  Not only is the appeal to chasing dollars in the last part of your argument contradictory with the loss statement of your first point, the behaviors of customers and the role of competition under Capitalism is completely ignored or misunderstood.<p>Under Capitalism, trades are voluntary.  If the common customer were not receiving sufficient value for their travel dollar, they wouldn&#x27;t be spending it on air travel.  It&#x27;s true, I would love to have one of those Emirates private rooms on every airline trip I take, but even a cramped little chair across country is often sufficient... when it&#x27;s not I upgrade.  Sometimes that trade isn&#x27;t worth it: if I&#x27;m travelling between the Bay Area and Los Angeles, I&#x27;ll usually drive because of the security hassle, though the cramped seats don&#x27;t help the airlines either.  Mind you, efficiency likely does require that I settle for the sufficient rather than the desirable... at least to keep things at a price I am willing to pay.<p>If the current system is not sufficient, under Capitalism a few things can happen.  Airlines can go bankrupt if they don&#x27;t attract customers or fail to keep costs reasonably below revenue.  If you see an industry where the entrenched players are old, inefficient, and failing to genuinely meet customer needs, hell that sounds like a golden opportunity!  Why not create an airline that is efficient and caters to the common customer and take advantage of the vacuum?  If a record label executive can do it why not some of the YC crowd?  I thought this group was about entrepreneurial disruption!  That is the Capitalist solution to marketplace inefficiency and it happens all the time.  So I have to reject your premise about what Capitalism is or is not about: your statement just doesn&#x27;t make sense nor does it bear up under study of the facts.<p>I suspect that the reason the airline industry is so apparently FUBAR is because it&#x27;s not so easy to achieve that ideal you envision for it, at least not without stealing money from some people to subsidize the travel of others.",1446836992

That may seem scary at first, but we built an analyzer that statically analyzes your program and gives you feedback (errors, warnings, and hints).<p>Dart is used at Google to build very big and complex apps, and our engineers use the analyzer in their build/CI systems to check their program. The analyzer is also wired into their IDEs. So they get feedback if a method doesn&#x27;t exist, or you are trying to pass a variable into a method that is expecting something else.<p>The Dart team is also working on an optional analyzer feature called &quot;strong mode&quot;, which does even more static checking. In strong mode, you can&#x27;t write code that is incorrectly typed (but, you can still write code that is dynamically typed, if you want to).<p>Our experience, at least internally, is that as your program matures and grows in complexity, developers appreciate the extra checks provided by strong mode. The win is that it&#x27;s something you can turn on later, when you&#x27;re ready. Early on in the program&#x27;s development, you are probably refactoring a lot and you don&#x27;t want to bother with strong mode. This scalability is a win for us.",1446836445

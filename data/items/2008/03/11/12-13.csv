Right now the only thing that gives an upmod value is that you can only upmod a story once.<p>Without some sort of constraint the only thing keeping people from upmodding continuously and rampantly is...

134146,comment,133978,134098,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Any site like this is designed so that upvoted content is seen by a much larger number of people than down voted content (which is, after all, pretty much the point). So you're going to get a lot more upvotes than downvotes, making rampant upvoting still strategically sound. You could weight negative positions more than positive ones, or you could also have a buy in cost. Buy in cost does provide a disincentive to voting which probably isn't desirable.",1205237257

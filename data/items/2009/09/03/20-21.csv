However, he also found that basically all of the difference is explained by higher quality connectors on the Monster cables compared to his ultra cheap bargain basement ones; when he replaced the cheap connectors with some modestly priced RCA connectors that weren't utter shit (but were not Monster cable made), the two cables were indistinguishable.<p>For the record, even -125dB is below the noise floor of arguably every person on earth.<p>So really, the most important thing for cables is to always use good connectors.  You cannot hear the difference between ""super duper copper"" and ""layman's copper.""<p>Another popular bit of audiophile snake oil is ""ribbon cables.""  These use wide, flat conductors instead of round ones because---they claim---the round conductors have higher impedance because of the skin effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect</a> ).  Of course, this is absolute bullshit, because skin depth at audio frequencies is more than the diameter of the round conductor.  What's more, since ribbon cables aren't coaxial, they're actually more susceptible to EMI.<p>...and people still spend hundreds or even thousands _on_the_cable_!",1252011556

When I was blocked on new power at SVTIX, I slapped a few new servers in at rippleweb.com, which is in Sacramento. If I had a big, expensive san I couldn't replicate, well, then I'd have a different model.  (rippleweb has awesome prices on high-power 1U server co-location, but it's not as good as getting a full rack elsewhere.)<p>But yes, the observation that you pay more if you want your stuff provisioned right now is very correct.

Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.<p>""10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect.""",1252008781

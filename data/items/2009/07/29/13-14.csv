Flying off the handle against the officer impedes his ability to do his job because he would have to wonder if the situation is escalating. Since he, initially, was by himself, it becomes a matter of self-protection and that is why some officers may immediately handcuff a person that concerns them, even if the officer is not sure what is going on.<p>By all accounts, the officer was being respectful while Gates was not, yet this article complains about the officer and the police.<p>Of course, if Gates was white, this would never be brought up even if the exact same thing happened in the exact same way.",1248875959

The company stopped paying because it was running out of money -- and the developer's [EDIT: resignation and subsequent] lawsuit threw a wrench into the company's efforts A) to launch, and B) to raise more money, either of which would have  measurably improved the odds of the developer's eventually getting paid.<p>[EDIT:  Keep in mind that the developer quit; the startup had to hire someone else to take over in order to get its product launched.

The legal system in most of the world is of a type called civil law, as contrasted to common law, but  common law tends to protect property better because property is more central to its conceptual framework.

However, while payment is generally enough to secure IP rights from employees, more is needed when dealing with contractors.<p>When it comes to rights in copyrighted work product, a consultant will own the IP unless a contract explicitly treats it as a work for hire or unless the rights are expressly assigned by the contract.<p>As appears from this piece, these rules are so fundamental that even a startup that pays a large amount of money can still be found not to own the IP resulting from that development work.

729927,comment,724521,727115,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"We can agree to disagree about the nature of the intervention being suggested.<p>As to testability, you have to remember that I believe we're still in the abduction stage of climate science -- finding the patterns from the data. We haven't even reached the hypothesis stage. So the 1500-year and solar-input theories are all about pattern-spotting. <i>If</i> a pattern is spotted, then I'm sure we can begin talking about hypotheses.<p>That's just where the science is, at least for me. That doesn't mean that it's ""full"" or ""mature"" science. I guess I'd call it honest science.<p>Yes, it does seem as if the political language has shifted away from ""warming"" to ""change"". Perhaps because warming is actually something you could conceivably measure? Whereas ""change"" is what, exactly? One of the signs that something is not science is when it gets stretched to meet incoming data that would normally disprove it.<p>One does not have to deny anything. Indeed, the onus is on the scientist to prove a connection, not the skeptic. You're getting it backwards. Perhaps we just don't understand how the climate works, and won't for another 500 years. Ignorance is the default position. It's up to science to move us from that. ""deniers"" have nothing to do with anything.<p><i>If the problem seems to go away - the Arctic starts freezing again</i> -- why is the arctic thawing a ""problem"". Because sea levels will rise? And because some people can't move out of the way quickly enough? You see, we go immediately from observation to guesswork to moral outrage to political action. Something wrong with that. From a political standpoint, I find it odd that we have some idea of what a ""problem"" is. When I ask about this, I've yet to get an answer that makes any sense to me. It all sounds so much like ""Man changes environment. Man is bad. Therefore, change is bad"" If a thousand sheep run across a mountaintop and ruin the tundra it's natural, but take a thousand people with cameras doing the same thing and it's a travesty.<p>These are aesthetic considerations, not scientific ones. I agree with most people's view of beauty in these areas -- who wants a ruined mountaintop or dirty air? But the devil is in the details here.<p>Science <i>is</i> self-correcting. I'm a hug fan of way science works. It's the intellectual light we have in the darkness. In practice, however, it's done in a very political atmosphere. People hang on to old ideas for a long time after they've been disproven. Not all new ideas are subjected to the same skepticism. Scientists are very cliquish. Science propagandizes itself to the masses -- scientists are always pure and noble. Progress always happens in a straight line.<p>We can also agree to disagree about science and politics. When I see government employees who are scientists lobby for political causes that directly support their research -- and then call dissenters ""deniers"" ""uneducated"" ""rubes"" ""shills"" -- we've entered a bad feedback loop.",1248873762

729909,comment,729823,729881,0,0,jacquesm,,,"well, if you compare the total combined traffic that was going to MSN search with what bing is receiving right now all that it was to date was a big 302 operation. The yahoo deal makes them a real contender. At least they won't be able to switch it off so easily. Microsoft has a bit of a history launching stuff with great fanfare only to quietly retire it a couple of years later.<p>search.msn.com , msn homepage search all these used to be a good bit of traffic, they now redirect to bing.<p>It makes good sense for them to get yahoo on board, it makes it harder to sell yahoo to some third party and they get a bunch of traffic. For yahoo it is mostly about cutting costs and not having to compete with both microsoft <i>and</i> google at the same time.<p>EDIT: I just noticed this, even lots of the regular text links on the msn homepage now redirect to bing.com, that's simple statistics inflation. For instance check the hot topics section on <a href=""http://www.msn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msn.com/</a>",1248872972

That that wasn't just some random bullshit I made up on the spot, it's actually a case where we did wrong by taking something that's okay in moderation and trying to use it in large quantities?  Do I really think url shorteners are as bad as spraying poison out of a firehose?  No, but <i>it was a fucking analogy</i>.",1248872958

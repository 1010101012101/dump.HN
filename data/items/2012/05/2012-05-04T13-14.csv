3928363,comment,3927858,3928196,32,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Why do you need catering?</i><p>Conferences are all about coffee breaks. The coffee breaks <i>are</i> the conference.<p>Sitting around passively listening to lecturers is not a conference. It is a lecture, or as we call it these days, ""live-action Vimeo"".<p>Serving food and drinks to everyone at the same time is a way of keeping everyone together in the same space, where they can bump into each other, look over each other's shoulders, and convene spontaneous hallway meetings. That is what conferences are for. Otherwise we could just use Reddit.<p>In the end, you need catering because people at your conference <i>want</i> the catering. I spent hundreds of dollars per hour for the chance to stand with my colleagues in a space that's especially designed for meetings, but now I need to <i>leave</i> that space for several precious prime-time hours every day just to find food and eat it? Please, just sell me catering already!",1336139940

Unless you mean that like in mailing lists (which is an example of what you're asking for) or that disgusting nonsense called threading in VBulletin which is absolutely not what I'm talking about.<p>I mean, reddit itself proves that it's not unsustainable in a general case. I honestly don't know how reddit's comment system is confusing to anyone. (What I'm describing is literally just reddit but replies bump the topic, and there would be less volume as they're topic/question driven forums).<p>Besides, are you arguing Disqus has implemented a bad idea? Because they're more or less doing what I'm talking about, but instead of having ""multiple topics"", it's just attached to a blog post. Imagine a listing of blog posts where the ""post"" is the ""topic starter"". Bam, it's done. You have a ""forum"" with topics and replies that are threaded, organized and voted on for accuracy. That's my biggest problem with forums is that anyone can post, there's often no moderation (and if there is, it's not for correctness) and people say just asinine things when they think they're correct and don't stop to think about what they're saying or whether or not they're qualified to be giving other people help.<p>edit: Oh, you think reddit has bad UI. Um... I mean, you did disclose it as your opinion. I love it. It's minimal, it's fast, it's content focused and it's pretty easy to use. It's certainly not flashy, no, but then most phpbb2 forums go the exact opposite route, where content takes up 1% of the physical page space, there are gaudy signatures and grandiose themes.

3928305,comment,3927858,3927858,18,0,adrianhoward,,,"It sounds like the conference Amber went to was a bad conference. They exist. Both expensive and non-expensive ones :-)<p>A few thoughts...<p>1) Price != Value<p>Just like everything else in life the price tag is not the way to judge a conference. It's the value received. Some free conferences will be worth 1000 to somebody. Some 1000 conferences will be worth nothing to somebody else. Some expensive conferences will suck universally. Some free events will too. If you want to know what a conference will be like - go look at previous years. Go look at the speakers. Go talk to people who have attended. Figure out if it's the right conference for you.<p>For example, I was scheduled in as a speaker at last year's Agile 2011 conference. As a <i>speaker</i> it would have cost me about 6k to attend once you take travel from the UK, hotel & lost work hours into account. That's money out of my pocket - I run my own business.<p>I couldn't attend at the last minute due to family illness. Judging by previous years not attending has <i>lost me money</i>. Agile 2011 is worth <i>more</i> that 6k to me and my business. To somebody in a different business, or with different skills - probably not.<p>Another way to think about what conferences provide - ask yourself what your day rate is? How many working days of value are you expecting to get from the conference?<p>2) Experts need events too<p>Yes there have to be events with a broad appeal for ""high schoolers, college students and newbies to our industry"". But there also needs to be events for ""people who already know everything youd need to know about the presented topics"".<p>The latter might not enjoy the former's events. The former may not enjoy the latter's events. Finding a balance that will attract and entertain both groups is really fricking hard.<p>3) Cost of large events<p>I've been involved several times with organising conferences both small (e.g. BarCamp Bournemouth - 2days, 75ish people, free) and large (Agile 2010 with 1400ish people, five days, $1-2k & Agile 2012 - probably about the same). Anybody who thinks large conferences are massive money spinners has never been involved with organising a large conference :-)<p>Large conferences are not usually cheaper to organise because of economies of scale. Quite the opposite if anything.<p>For example take the venue. For small conferences you can often cadge a venue with some sponsorship, or find a small one in a slack period running cheap. You're flexible because you can change location on very short notice and there are usually multiple venues in a town or city that can support you.<p>For large conferences there are few venues that can support you. Those venues' business is based around extracting every last penny from large events - and they're very good at it. They need to be booked months, sometimes more than a year, in advance. Which brings in a whole set of different organisational and cash-flow issues...

Please note, developers are everywhere, think about it.<p>Often times the airfare and hotel equal or go beyond the costs of the conference ticket. Therefore I don't go to a lot of conferences, it's just too hard to justify them.

Oh, and then you have to add in A/V costs on top of that.  Our conference center provides nice projection screens (huge) and nice mics as part of the rooms.<p>Catering - people need to eat.  99% of conference venues will not let you bring in random food, or in most cases even professional catering companies, unless they're on an approved list.  Snacks/coffee/tea/etc throughout the day cost.  Our food cost, including lunch, was north of $20/head.  This is surprisingly cheap.<p>Power - some conference venues charge you for power access.  $x/seat or something.  We cut down on that this year compared to first year because few people seemed to use it the first years.<p>Wifi - our conference center has good wifi and it's free.  One place I looked at said wifi access was $25/head/day.  That's not a typo.<p>One of my goals was to have an event with non-local speakers.  A barcamp is great, but... you end up seeing mostly the same people speak on the same topics.  By having people from out of the area (state/region) speak, you'll be guaranteeing most attendees in the region won't have seen/met these speakers before.  That costs something.  Most of our speakers have been gracious with their time, but I wanted to at least cover some of their expenses in travel.  With 20 speakers, and 8-10 with that sort of assistance, that's an additional cost.<p>I lost > $3k on the first event.  ~$2k this time around, and would like to break even this year, or perhaps (gasp) make a small profit.  A large profit would allow me to do regional versions of indieconf in different areas, bringing together a mix of local and non-local experts on various freelancing topics.  That was the idea 2 years ago, but I can't commit to that until I know I won't keep losing money.<p>EDIT: oh yeah, insurance.  The venue requires an insurance policy.  For the minimum coverage, that's another... $600 or so.<p>EDIT 2:  I would have probably broken even this year except for 2 things.<p>1) speaker dinner.  Given the enormous effort many of our speakers put in (and travel) I like to have a low-key speaker dinner that's private for them to unwind.  We have a few attendees that pay for a premium ticket to have a few dining hours for some one-on-one with our speakers.  As fun as it's been, we may change that event this year.<p>2) After-party.  This year instead of some ritzy club or venue, we had a jazz trio come in and had some catered snacks (veggie trays, etc).  No alcohol, but I don't think anyone cared.<p>Without those two additional things, I think we'd have broken even this year on tickets and sponsorships.  I'd rather not eliminate either one, as I think they each add something special for different groups.",1336137981

I am a professional programmer with a Unix pedigree working as a quant in banking and even I succumbed to the charms of Excel (I still managed to evade VBA though).<p>I'll start with sharing. The idea of sharing is mostly .xls or .xslx file on mapped network drive and shouting over the floor ""Jane, please close quarter results""<p>Sometimes they are shared on SharePoint which is only marginally better.<p>So, yeas, sharing is a problem.<p>But still most of the Excel use (at least with quants) is one off and the end result is a couple of charts that you put into presentation or some insights about numbers and data.<p>Excel is very good for interactive calculations and what if analysis when you have a complicated chain of formulas and you need results immediately updated when you change inputs<p>Excel is very good for exploratory data analysis: again charts are immediately updated when you change data and you do not have to remember a lot of API to make then in the first place unlike, say in Matlab or Matplotlib or ggplot.<p>Old Excel limitation on rows and columns was a problem but not anymore. Lack of column formula (when you would type say =B+C in D's header instead of =B1+D1 and then control-dragging for thousands of rows) (btw Guys from Resolver systems implemented that). Ugly charts.<p>Also, not a problem with Excel per se, but rather with people who try to use Excel for things it was not designed for: apply it to large datasets and build complex systems on top of it.",1336136592

Back in 2001 I was helping some guys make a voice chat site aimed at Brazil,  and against my advice,  they implemented validation in Javascript and not on the server.<p>We launched and it all seemed OK for a few weeks until I get a call at 7 pm because the site is all f'ed up.<p>Well,  doing some investigation I find that there's a user with the empty string for his user name and that this has had a bigger impact on the system than one might think.<p>I nuked the guy with the SQL monitor and added server-side validation that night.<p>Since then I worked on hundreds of different sites and web applications and I've had to deal with the busted app made by somebody who was too lazy to do server side validation many many times.<p>On one hand you've got the person who browses without Javascript turned on.  Perhaps you're one of the cool kids who makes apps that don't work at all without Javascript,  so you don't need to worry about him.<p>You still need to worry about the people that want to mess with you.  If you build a community site that's substantial at all (say 10,000+ users) you're going to get hit.  Today it's easier than ever to reverse-engineer client-server communication with Firebug and then use curl or another tool to make phony requests.<p>Apps built in this style,  where all validation is done on the client have a surface area that's 100% soft underbelly.",1336136479

Cars; if you drive a light car you are one of those environmental turds. I overheard a group of guys in an expensive restaurant saying things like; 'yeah of course, but then my car weighs 2500 kilos hahahaahaha'; a lot of senseless weight-dropping to show value and wealth.<p>I do agree with you on some levels, but PERSONALLY I find the SII feeling like something cheap compared to the iPhone 4. Like a lot of people thought the 3g felt cheap compared to the 4 as well because of the plastic. I guess Apple thought that as well? I like my 3g more in a lot of ways; I dropped it on concrete a lot of times and it has a few cracks in the plastic; I dropped the 4 once and the screen is gone (might be bad luck, but this is the perception I have now).<p>My Lumia, which feels actually <i>better</i> in many ways than the 4 or SII, but it scratches really easy and has a lot of other bad things I talked about before.<p>The feeling of flimsiness has nothing to do with my usage; as I said above; I use my SII far more than my other phones. I build apps/games for a living so I need A LOT of phones (especially Android testing is hell; you'll get negative reviews for all the phones you skip buying/testing on often; it's like going back 10 years for mobile dev :) and I currently do like the SII best esp with ICS.

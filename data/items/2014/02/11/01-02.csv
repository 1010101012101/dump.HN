The modern Windows kernel is just as stable as Linux. Sadly, the same can&#x27;t be said for third party drivers written by Android manufacturers. As for the full system stack. I&#x27;m primarily an Android user but I find Windows Phone seems to be a lot more stable from a user perspective.<p>Second, opennes. The Linux kernel is open, but most of Android is not (and with each Android release this gets worse). Forking would mean rewriting all the closed parts. A lot of Google Play apps don&#x27;t even work on the Kindle Fire because of the closed parts being different. The only reason forking worked for Amazon in the first place, was that they were selling based on their already existing Kindle ecosystem, not based on Android, Android was just the enabler.<p>Shifting gears to Android that late in the game would not have suddenly allowed Nokia to catch up to Samsung. Samsung had been organising themselves for years to reap the advantages that come with Android. They didn&#x27;t just release an Android phone and become an industry leader overnight.<p>I still think Windows Phone was the better option for Nokia given how immature Maemo/Meego still was (which was primarily Nokia&#x27;s fault for not anticipating the market and not prioritising it higher). At the end of the day, even a smart decision won&#x27;t help you if you make it too late.",1392082877

As long as they generate more revenue for my client at an acceptable cost per conversion (sales, not likes) we will spend more on google. Google isn&#x27;t just taking, it&#x27;s giving (a lot). As long as the last segment, ie actual conversions affecting ad serving, is missing, google will remain our favorite marketing channel.<p>#2 - Facebook has a major <i>intent</i> issue.<p>Eyeballs are nice, but <i>only</i> if those eyeballs have the <i>intent</i> to convert/purchase, which is rarely the case for high price, non-luxury and non-lifestyle items on the FB site itself, unlike a lead generated by google&#x27;s search engine.<p>I have read about the &quot;tricks&quot; to minimize useless clicks and learned about some more below, but it really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard.<p>PS I do realize that my situation is quite specific - see comment above or below, hospitality industry, busy market, price-sensitive audience, not a big brand name, etc. It may work for you, it just doesn&#x27;t work for us, and not just because of the fake likes.",1392082811

Because someone wants to make money. Why are the weird free games made commonly by minority artists that play a huge role in changing how we think of the medium excluded from news coverage and conference talks? Because someone wants to make money.</i><p>There are? In fact, there&#x27;s more now than ever, especially with the popularity of postmodernism in a large variety of media publications.<p>Now, I agree with you on &quot;weird free games&quot; that are excluded from mainstream attention. They&#x27;re not profitable. But then again, being countercultural has never been profitable. What&#x27;s more: most people don&#x27;t want to play art games and minimalistic, philosophically motivated indie productions. They want the next multiplayer Call of Duty game. It&#x27;s a sad reality, but it is what it is.<p>I have to ask you, however... why are you specifically referring to <i>minority</i> artists? Minority in the sense of intellectual disposition, or in the sense of demographics? If it&#x27;s the latter, then minority game developers are very rare to begin with. That&#x27;s not really a fault of institutions not giving them attention.<p>You also imply that all art games or games developed by minorities <i>deserve</i> attention. This is not the case. I consider myself to be open-minded when it comes to a good art game with a message, but there&#x27;s tons of underproduced crap that masquerades under the banner of art to make up for its mediocrity.<p><i>It doesn’t sound nice when it’s constantly called out, does it? Because it isn’t. There is a price tag to participating in games. The mainstream culture of games development demands you are from a class of people who could go into computer science or digital art training and have enough resources to handle an industry that has a terrible track record with labor issues. The standard success story of someone in the games media is a person who can afford to keep up with the newest products and has the resources to write for free or low-wage for about two years. Important conferences, even when you’re invited to speak, often cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars to attend.</i><p>This is all true. Crunch time and low wages are notorious.<p><i>The idea of success outside the conventional method of capitalism, which is intersectional in its effects, is met with contempt.</i><p>This is obviously true for AAA companies who want to keep their hegemony, but I honestly doubt most people are hostile to unconventional business models for indie games. Quite the contrary, such endeavors are becoming more popular and people are getting more receptive to them. I&#x27;d blame contempt on a lack of imagination more than anything.<p><i>The conversation of what is and isn’t a game is often, intentionally or not, used to assign value to already established gaming conventions that benefit the established system and marginalize works that do not look like it, and therefore threaten it. Mobile games are often slated as ‘casual’ games, which people in the gaming press and development overall side-eye as a genre of games mostly just looking to grab people’s money.</i><p>Except casual games <i>are</i> a legitimate distinction. This also includes their business model. As for people berating hardcores versus casuals, that&#x27;s largely an in-joke.<p><i>Except, well, that’s ALL of AAA games, such as the hype around how much Grand Theft Auto V made despite that it was profiting off of flagrant sexism and racism.</i><p>Uh... GTA V may not exactly be the most social justice-friendly game out there, but it portrays the grisly aspects of the real world as they are.<p><i>Dong is considered an outsider. Who is he? From Vietnam? Oh, that explains this ‘knock-off’ rhetoric people are using.</i><p><i>It’s because the gaming community set up a success narrative for certain indie, mostly white, mostly men, mostly from English-speaking countries, developers who strive to make smaller games competitive with the big dogs.</i><p>And here we go, people... the reason there was a backlash against Flappy Bird was because the developer was Vietnamese! IT WAS ALL RACISM!<p>Hate to break it to you, but Flappy Bird was a painfully generic and dead simple Helicopter clone with graphics that imitated (not saying stolen from, but imitated) Super Mario Bros. People were mostly baffled at the insane success of such a, quite frankly, stupid game.<p><i>Because of social justice activism and outside pressure from a society that sees gaming as grotesque, awareness about how exclusionary games are is at critical mass and the industry is scrambling to answer. It has no fucking clue how to market to and include minority members of their community and in the world at large. So when Farmville, Peggle, Candy Crush Saga, and Flappy Bird appeal to this mysterious audience big budget and scrappy indies can’t seem to tap, it’s foul play.</i><p>I can&#x27;t believe this author is legitimately defending games like Farmville and Candy Crush, which are deliberately designed to be highly addictive, while having a highly grinding gameplay and then carelessly exploiting its players down to the last penny. All this coming from an anti-capitalist, too.<p>But that&#x27;s how the gaming industry works. Like any other industry, it exists to make a profit. The gaming community isn&#x27;t some misogynistic wasteland of sexism and racism. If you can even claim there&#x27;s one coherent gaming &quot;community&quot;, that is. There&#x27;s plenty of subcultures separated from each other. The main problem with gaming is the immaturity of its audience.<p>Ultimately, more social justice drivel.

I&#x27;m a CS student in my third year of college, I&#x27;m 19. I feel old, I spend most of my time alone, and I feel as if I have no motivation for anything. My college experience has been, honestly, brutally disappointing; I just look around and see my peers having the time of their lives, finding opportunities, spending time with friends. I feel as if I&#x27;m not part of this community of young, interesting, capable people.<p>Worse still, I have no single person to tell these things to. I used to, but one by one they have left. I&#x27;m scared about being like a black hole...was my attitude the thing that led them away? I don&#x27;t want to fall into that ugly spiral of negative thoughts, I don&#x27;t want to be the person nobody wants to talk to, but I&#x27;m afraid I have become that guy. I deeply wish to be a cool, interesting person to be around with. This is so hard! I feel that before I had something to offer to people, something that made me interesting. I feel as if I&#x27;ve lost that.<p>I’m currently in counselling, but the therapist keeps telling me I should keep talking to at least one stranger every single day. I don&#x27;t see it working, and it drains me physically, mentally and specially emotionally. I have no way of letting this out - I can&#x27;t cry. Tears simply won&#x27;t come out.<p>I constantly ask myself how could I -and why the hell I can&#x27;t- connect and surround myself with the people that I would like to be with. Those, with which I could make projects, play music, stay up all night chatting, have the adventures people in college are supposed to have. It&#x27;s just so difficult for me to even analyze what I&#x27;m doing wrong, or what I&#x27;m supposed to do.

And there is substantial empirical evidence which I linked you to expect it to be <i>far</i> below average. Rescuing a preemie, even if it were free, would be a bad idea compared to alternatives like simply trying again.<p>> Even if the child winds up providing 50% of the value of an average person, it can still be a net gain.<p>And we&#x27;re right back to your original problem: you are not thinking on the margin. The alternative to spending millions on premature babies is not no babies ever. (And even if it was, there&#x27;s still superior alternatives: for example, lobbying for Open Borders. Think of all the millions of immigrants who&#x27;d love to come to the USA, for free! We wouldn&#x27;t even have to pay them! Why, even if they&#x27;re 99% below average, it&#x27;s still a gain!)<p>> The stats you cite are for extreme cases on the edge of viability and the odds still slightly favor normal or near-normal development.<p>Which is what we are discussing, is it not? Or do even slightly premature babies come with million-dollar pricetags...?<p>> That&#x27;s horrible reasoning. The human body has evolved over millions of years for birth. It is the optimal gestation machine. We&#x27;re working on approximating this optimal machine with artificial machines<p>I&#x27;m not seeing any disagreement here. Yes, the human body <i>is</i> the optimal gestation machine. That&#x27;s why premature babies come with all the penalties. (And note that those citations are just the penalties sufficient to be documented with small samples; there&#x27;s not much reason to expect the penalty to abruptly cut off somewhere, it&#x27;s just the long-term effects shrink enough to be hidden by noise and methodological problems and researcher careers&#x27; limits.)<p>> That starts at birth.<p>An arbitrary line is not a good basis for a system of ethics and governance.<p>> What you&#x27;re proposing is barbaric and borderline infantcide.<p>I&#x27;m happy to own to that. It is infanticide. Premature fetuses are not humans in the moral sense: they have no hopes, they have no dreams, they have no desires or preferences, they do not think, and they have the moral status of a puppy or kitten. Given the disabilities they come with, throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars in heroic medical measures is a crime against society and the person the parents could have raised instead.",1392082107

I have made hundreds of loans and I worry about rates above 40%.  I seek lower rates (often between 20-30%) and find them often.  The article says Kiva doesn&#x27;t discuss the rate - but it is shown on every lending page, as a lender you can select based on loan rate (I know, I do).<p>The article also doesn&#x27;t provide data either on the failure of Kiva to help.  Granted I think Kiva should provide more data on the impact of loans and whether it is helping or not - I like to believe it is but <a href=&quot;<a href=""http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2009/10/16/micro-credit-research/&quot;>I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2009/10/16/micro-credit-...</a> do question how useful Kiva really is</a>.<p>I don&#x27;t know about expenses for Kiva (though sites like Charity navigator rate it highly).  But as a lender on Kiva it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  Kiva expenses are paid by donation.  To lend using Kiva you can make donations but you don&#x27;t have to.  High expenses matter it seems to me if you are choosing who to donate to.<p>Kiva does take advantage of human psychology in a smart way it seems to me, connecting lenders to people that need loans.  It is a bit of a fiction as the article points out but it is also real - your re-payments are based on that loan.  I see the benefits of that human connection as worthwhile (people like that human connection - showing their photos adds to that) though agree if you want to find fault it is something you can question.<p>I like another site that provides charity to local groups directly <a href=""http://www.globalgiving.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalgiving.org/</a> I do figure there is more chance of fraud given the nature of having lots of little organizations that it is hard to monitor.

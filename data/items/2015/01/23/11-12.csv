It&#x27;s as another commenter said, it&#x27;s the ability to &quot;visit the right clubs and (therefore) know the right people&quot;. Studying at Harvard isn&#x27;t going to make you a millionaire. Being from a Harvard legacy family and already being a millionaire is going to make you a millionaire.<p>Your point about the value of owning land in the past was spot on. Several hundred years ago the primary occupation was subsistence farming, which requires a lot of fertile land. The most readily available source of energy was the photosynthetic energy from the sun stored in the trees of the forest, access to which also required lands. And the most healthful food sources were the animals who lived off of those lands. But today? We have a diversity of occupations, ample energy and plenty of food (in the developed western world at least). We have these things because of an increasingly complex web of progress and interdependence that&#x27;s been enabled by technology. The resources that really matter in 2015 are human resources. The world is changing faster than any textbook can keep up with, faster than even the best teachers can understand and communicate to others. The only way to find and take advantage of the newest the rent seeking opportunities is to associate with the people who are creating them. Knowing a guy who knows a guy is the new nobility, and no amount of book learning can compete with being a member of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.<p>On the brighter side, society is exponentially more egalitarian than it was in the days of the landed aristocracy. If a man from Victorian England could observe the current level of social mobility (again, in the developed west) he would end up flat on his fainting couch. Unfortunately there is no way to prevent the wealthy from using their resources to give their kids a better life than everyone else has. Most people genuinely love their kids more than anything, who&#x27;s to tell them that they can&#x27;t spend money on what they hold most dear? The good news is that the long view paints a pretty picture. We&#x27;re as far from aristocracy as we&#x27;ve ever been, and we&#x27;re not going back any time soon.",1422014317

Gox, already.<p>Completely holding judgement on Gemini.

A company called Copterline flew between Finland&#x27;s Helsinki and Estonia&#x27;s Tallinn for many years with two Sikorsky S-76 helicopters. The trip was over the ocean and took 18 minutes.<p>Sadly one of their copters crashed into the ocean in 2005, killing all 14 aboard. The reason was purely technical. The hydraulic steering system got stuck due to debris that had came loose from an inner coating. The copter was impossible to steer and started spinning around its axis, and spun 13 times until hitting the ocean.<p>It was the beginning of the end for the company. Later in 2008 they started again with two AgustaWestland AW139 copters. I was aboard once, and it was a fantastic experience. However, it boggled my mind how much even a modern helicopter vibrates. It&#x27;s a wonder to me how copters can withstand the constant violent vibration. Apparently they can, except in rare cases.<p>In 2004 Copterline transported 75 000 passengers. If all flights were full (12 passengers and 2 pilots) it means about 17 flights a day, every single day.<p>Copterline went out of business in December 2008 because it was unprofitable.

8934259,comment,8933528,8933675,0,0,olavk,,,"My take on how to explain basic IO without having to explain monads:<p>(1) Any function with interacts with the world is called an IO function and has the result type &quot;IO something&quot;. e.g. &quot;IO String&quot; for getLine (because it returns a String). Functions and expressions which does not interact with the world are called &#x27;pure&#x27;. IO is a type constructor, but for now it makes sense to think of it as a &quot;tag&quot; on result values which guarantees we cannot mix IO-functions with pure functions. If we could call IO functions inside pure functions, the whole idea of pure would dissolve. The IO &quot;tag&quot; allows the compiler to enforce that this can&#x27;t happen.<p>(2) A function which calls IO functions uses &#x27;do&#x27;-notation:<p><pre><code>    somefun = do\n	putStrLn &quot;Hello&quot;\n	putStrLn &quot;World&quot;\n</code></pre>\nEach line is a single IO function call (with arguments which are pure expressions). Each line in the do-block should be indented to the same level. (Only in the case where the function consist of just a single IO-call can the &#x27;do&#x27; be left out, which is why you can write &#x27;main = putStrLn &quot;hello World&quot;&#x27;). The do-notation guarantees that the operations are executed sequentially. The return value of the function is the return value of the last operation in the do-block.<p>If you want to use the return value of an IO function, you use a left-arrow (<-) to read it into a variable. Eg.<p><pre><code>    somefun = do\n        putStrLn &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n	name <- getLine \n	putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name)\n\n</code></pre>\nNote that you cannot simplify the two lines to:<p><pre><code>    X	putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ getLine)\n</code></pre>\nThe above breaks the rule that each IO function call have to be on a separate line in the do-block. IO-function calls can not be nested in expressions, they have to be sequential.<p>(3) Calling pure functions.\nYou cannot call IO function from pure code, but you can call pure functions from IO-code. This is done via &#x27;let&#x27;:<p><pre><code>    somefun = do\n        putStrLn &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n	name <- getLine \n	let name2 = reverse name\n	putStrLn (&quot;Olleh, , &quot; ++ name2)\n</code></pre>\nNote how the let syntax is distinctly different from the left-arrow syntax. The let syntax just assigns the result of a pure expression to a variable. The arrow syntax &quot;extracts&quot; a pure value from an IO value. The result of getLine is &#x27;IO string&#x27; but the arrow &quot;untags&quot; it so the type of name is just &quot;String&quot;, and it can be used as part of a pure expression.<p>(4) Returning pure values.\nThe return type of a IO function has to be IO something. In the above example the return type is &#x27;IO ()&#x27; since this is the result type of the last operation, putStrLn. But what if we want to return say the reversed name? The reversed name is a pure value, so this is will not compile:<p><pre><code>    somefun = do\n        putStrLn &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n	name <- getLine \n	let name2 = reverse name\n	putStrLn (&quot;Olleh, &quot; ++ name2)\n    X	name2\n</code></pre>\nWe have to turn the String into an &quot;IO String&quot;, because the result type of an IO function has to be &quot;IO something&quot;. This is done with the &quot;return&quot; operation, which turns a pure value into the corresponding IO value.\nThe name &quot;return&quot; is unfortunate since it looks equivalent to &quot;return&quot; in imperative languages. But in Haskell &quot;return&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually exit the function. The function exits after the last operation regardless of the use of &quot;return&quot;. The only thing &quot;return&quot; does is to &quot;tag&quot; a pure value so we can return it from an IO function:<p><pre><code>    somefun = do\n        putStrLn &quot;What is your name?&quot;\n	name <- getLine \n	let name2 = reverse name\n	putStrLn (&quot;Olleh, &quot; ++ name2)\n   	return name2</code></pre>",1422010865

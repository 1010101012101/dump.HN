75684,comment,75422,75563,0,0,pixcavator,,,"I was mostly relieved. I wasn't insane after all. Some problems are simple, some hard, and some can't be solved. These approaches are very indirect and people may be tempted to use them without first asking the question: can this problem be solved (in principle!) with the data that we have?",1194054192

75682,comment,75521,75677,0,0,dood,,,"I would argue that micropayments will work one day: people are ready and willing to make micropayments, the barrier is the cognitive cost of making the payment. If there were some well-established way to give money with a couple of clicks and zero thought, I think a lot of people would do it.",1194054049

75673,comment,75206,75638,0,0,gscott,,,"I think that other sites with user generated content like folklore.org has created a tidy profit by compiling the information into a format people can buy (in that case a book).  I personally believe if the site had a cd-rom version say on a subscription service (every 3 months you get a new cd-rom) that people would be happy to pay $10 for it and he could hit his revenue target (1% paying $10 a month).   Not that I would ever look at such material!",1194051823

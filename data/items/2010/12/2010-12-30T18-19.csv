The importance of this has been stressed over and over again and is no longer disputed.  In fact, when an in-house team started designing changes to an accounting app my friend had to use, there was an official user expert designated to work with the developers.  The user ""expert"" was her manager, who had never used the application that was being changed, had never used a similar application, and had never even done a job similar to the one done by the users.  What's more, she forbade the developers to speak to the users because she didn't want the development effort to affect their productivity.  Oh, it did affect their productivity eventually, believe me it did.<p>(It's an exaggeration to say it's uniformly terrible; I had a good experience with the one enterprise app I built, but it was for a network operations team, so they understood a lot about software and about the need to be generous with time and access.)",1293735357

Its like TV hosting the ad of the advertiser for a period of time. If the TV wants to tell people buy the advertiser product, then most of the advertiser wouldn't mind.<p>If however, say KFC is advertising on the TV, and instead of impression, they are taking a cut whenever someone who watched the TV goes to KFC, then the situation would be very different. Which is the case of Google, where each click has a cost.<p>My advice to him, instead of depending on Google, just get the advertisers directly and just charge by impression, or at least a fix charge for a period of time.

2053181,comment,2052712,2052712,0,0,VanL,,,"To start with: IAAPL.<p>In my opinion, there are only three times when software patents are useful:<p>1. There is a hard computer science problem at the very core of your product or service -- one that you have solved, that competitors have not, and that gives you an advantage. Further, the answer to this problem, once known, is easily replicable. The canonical example of this is Google/PageRank, and the closest non-software analogue is drug research. This is what software patents are designed to protect and they usually do an ok job of it.<p>2. You are a large business and you have grown to the point that you are attracting attention from patent trolls and other large, patent-holding entities. At this level, the quality of the patents usually doesn't matter nearly as much as the quantity. It becomes a ""my stack is bigger than your stack"" type of negotiation, and having a very large pile of manure is useful because people are forced to assume there is a pony or two in there. If you want to see an example of a company that has recently had this realization, look at Huawei and compare their total number of issued patents with their total number of patent applications.<p>3. You are inventing a completely new type of <i>hardware</i> device and you also file for patent on the software that interacts and enables it.<p>Two special cases:<p>If you are a startup, then (IMO) it rarely pays to file for patents unless you a) expect to get really big, or b) want to sell out to a big company. This is a special case of #2. Otherwise, execution trumps IP. Startups are just not big enough to worry about (or be targets).<p>It also may pay if you are creating a completely new market - think RSA. If software patents are part of this, then this is probably a special case of #1.",1293735027

This attitude is necessary because the hostile population lives right next door, or even within their borders. Its low-grade, low-tech and hard to prevent. The terrorists in Israel see themselves as foot soldiers trying to evict an occupying power.<p>Israelis accept terrorism because they have to, not because of some superior character.<p>This isn't the kind of terrorism that the US is trying to prevent. For a terrorist attack to be successful, it has to be high-profile, because terrorist activities in the US are primarily fund-raisers or propaganda events for organizations that otherwise operate closer to their homelands. This kind of big-bang events are not going to be easy to accept, or not publicize.<p>According to this view, an accepting attitude is not going to help the US with big-bang terrorism.

I used to do a lot of small client work in the early 00s, and it was clear to me that high-quality custom work does not make sense for small businesses; the ROI just isn't there. At the same time, the services targeting this market just churn out crap.<p>Solving this problem is tough because small business owners are an extremely diverse set, and the needs of different types of businesses vary widely.  Combine this with a general lack of internet savvy, a lot of folk wisdom picked up from friends and family about the web, and a do-it-yourself mentality means that an MVP is very difficult to sniff out.<p>The hardest part, though, is support.  The price of the service needs to be relatively cheap, but it needs to have good support, preferably 12x7 phone support.  Economically this won't scale unless the product is simple enough to minimize support needs.  10 years ago I think this problem was intractable, but with the internet becoming more and more ingrained in our daily lives, it's only a matter of time.<p>So yeah, personally I think this is a great market to be getting into.",1293734278

In my case, yesterday, a module of AHLTA crashed in the middle of my note and I had to restart to continue. The mouse functions in AHLTA don't support cut and paste, but luckily no one coded out ctrl-c and ctrl-v, so I was able to save a copy of my new patient's three separate complaints under ctrl-v while the system reloaded. Our system is designed with the idea of writing the note with the patient in the room (we don't even have a separate office, just the exam room and a corpsman). Fortunately my patient was herself in IT (one complaint was ... low back pain) and she was very understanding.  But I'm also faced with the problem that I either choose to look at the patient or the computer. The computer is not at a convenient angle for this.<p>So I'm forced to either spend less time with patients and write the note afterwards, physically not look at them, see fewer patients, or write my notes in the evening after the patients have started to fade and blur together.<p>I actually brought in my iPad yesterday, but didn't even get through the door before I realized there would be no HIPPA-compliant way to move the information from my iPad to AHLTA, especially since I don't have ready access to encryption tools.

The investors would logically want to secure their investment until break even.<p>If you feel yourself in the second group, patenting is still questionable. By blocking competition, one is cutting out the possibility to benefit from it. A good example is Groupon. A german company copied the unpatented idea and developped it Germany. They had the skill, they got the market by leveraging the cultural advantage they had regarding german marketing. 9 month later Groupon bought them 50M€.

Once such a drug has been found and approved by the FDA it is fairly trivial for a competitor to reproduce, which in the absence of patents, would allow the competitor to essentially appropriate all the R&D the initial developer did.<p>This development model is extremely different from that seen in software and related technologies where many small ideas are combined to form compelling technological solutions.  I suspect this difference in development models is the main reason for the much slower (linear) progress seen in medicine compared to information technologies (exponential).  I also suspect that as our understanding of biological systems improves, the pharmaceutical industry will evolve towards a more information based development model.<p>In any case, it seems to me that in the present, IP policy needs to accept that different industries have different development models and that a one size fits all IP policy is not a good solution.",1293733235

I would have started by spliting it into problem domains: enterprise apps, enterprise middleware, enterprise foundations, consumer apps, etc.  For each of these, I'd identify salient requirements: enterprise apps need to be easy to build, handle lots of form-ish data, connect with disparate systems; consumer apps needs strong branding capability, etc.  As with any market analysis, this would include information about size of market, number of dollars, how the customers behave, etc.<p>I would then have identified our core competencies: amazing browser interaction, strong form builder, strong component re-use architecture, automated version control and deployment to the cloud, etc.<p>Take the first, overlay it with the second, and start sorting by ""closest"" and ""number of dollars.""<p>The closest we were to identifying a market was (more by default than choice) ""consumer apps."" Unfortunately, that's a really bad market for development tools because there are so many good, free ones available.<p>We later tried switching to enterprise apps, but we had significant deficiencies there (poor integration support [great web services support, good RDB support, but no other integration options], no on-premise deployment (a real problem for most enterprises, especially two years ago), among others.<p>Since we weren't willing to commit to that market segment to fill the holes (instead, focusing on developing a little of everything), we couldn't build a compelling sales story.<p>Ultimately, the problem was they put their headphones on, started coding, looked up three years later, then tried to scramble to figure out how to take everything they'd built and get people to use it.  They should have started from day one looking for customers to work with, started telling their story to see what resonated, and adjusted their roadmap to match.",1293732408

2053001,comment,2052457,2052916,0,0,mdwrigh2,,,"I'm a HTC Hero user (US, CDMA version) on Sprint, and I'm currently running a Cyanogen build on it. I've actually run a number of different ROMs on my phone, Cyanogen just tends to be the most stable, and cruft-free. There are step by step guides for rooting and installing a new bootloader to your phone, which are all fairly easy to follow. Once you've done that, it's just a matter of dropping the ROM image onto your SD card, booting into recovery mode, and hitting install. Not a one click solution, but given an hour or two, simple to follow.<p>As to the quality of the ROMs themselves, it (of course) varies. I've never had anything that was just outright unusable (except maybe the stock ROM -- it was ungodly slow). The first few ROMs I used crashed about once or twice a week, which was annoying, but typically happened while I wasn't using the phone, so I just felt it vibrate in my pocket. Now that I've switched to Cyanogen though, this problem has completely disappeared, and the phone is very quick, especially compared to the stock image. Seriously, if anyone else has a HTC Hero, I'd recommend rooting and moving to the Cyanogen mod ROM, it's like having a completely different phone. Plus, I get to be on 2.2, while the stock ROM is still on 2.1<p>The only downside of it so far is that I couldn't manage to get my carrier voicemail working with the image. There may be a workaround for this, I just haven't looked. Since Google Voice integrates so well with the handset, you can tell your phone to forward all of your voice mail to VG, but not use it for any thing else (or choose when to use it for calls, etc., it's amazingly flexible).<p>I use the xda-developers forum for all of my rooting and ROM needs, and you can probably browse some of the feedback and FAQs there if you have any questions. Alternatively, my e-mail is in my profile if you have any questions you can't seem to find answers to.",1293732347

4719177,comment,4718497,4719082,2,0,elteto,,,"Exactly, we humans try to learn new things by relating to what we already know. This leads to trouble when we encounter new subjects that have no connection to previous experiences, because we have a hard time relating to it. However, the problem with people finding QM esoteric and weird is a bit more nuanced than that.<p>In most of the other areas of knowledge we can make progress because they <i>do</i> resemble reality in ways that we are familiar with. For example rotation in classical mechanics or special relativity can be somewhat confusing to a beginner, but if we think a little bit deeper than what we are used to then we can see that the results make sense and match what we <i>experience</i>. And also this experience is consistent at different scales. Now you move to QM and the first thing that hits you is that reality ""breaks"" after some point in the size scale, beyond that <i>everything</i> is different, with uncertainties, probabilities and a bunch of other odd properties. Learning QM is an exercise in mind-stretching, even for the most capable of us. For me the problem is not that it is different, but <i>why</i> is different. Why do we have such a gap between the large scale and the small scale? That is what baffles me.",1351626919

4719122,comment,4710215,4714427,1,0,edanm,,,"You wrote a large reply, so I feel I owe you a good response. Honestly, I feel it's kind of, let's say, interesting, that I have to defend things like ""maybe we'd like more than one font size"". Maybe it's worth the sacrifice for having vim retain the same look-and-feel in the terminal, but to outright think that variable font sizes are inherently useless in a software program? Whose primary purpose is to edit text, no less?<p>Still, here are some examples of more functional ways vim could be better. Most of these are related to visuals, yes, because that's the main thing that plugins can't change in vim.<p>Examples:<p>1. Code folding is there to make it easier to scan code. Vim's folds take up a lot of space, and aren't very easy to scan. Yes, this is subjective - it's possible that for you, it's the easiest to scan thing in the world. But for me, the way many modern editors work is better - have a simple, colored, ""..."" indicator at the end of the line that has a fold after it. Simple, easy to scan, doesn't take up any more lines on screen. Minimal, in the sense of UI.<p>2. Adding some kind of info in the margin. Most editors add some kind of way to see folds in the margin. This is usually kept very tight, since all you really need are some dashed-lines and a ""+"" sign, perhaps. Not possible with vim. The closest we have is ""foldcolumn"", which a) takes up a lot of space, and b) is less visually appearling, <i>making it harder to understand or use</i>. Other info is also sometimes added, not just folds.<p>3. The project opening. While I love ctrl-p, especially over the alternatives, it has several flaws. For example, it's very, noticeably, slow. And I'm on small projects, usually.<p>But here's the bigger issue: the way ctrl-p in Sublime works is more beautiful, but that's not the only advantage. It makes it easier to see what file you're going to open. It makes it easier by doing things like bold-ing the letters that it's matched. It makes it easier by making the filenames ""REALLY BIG"", but still giving you the details of the file's location in a <i>smaller font</i>.<p>There are really many more issues I can bring up, but these are the keys. In all honesty, vim is a bad choice for most people because, to get it to the level of what Sublime Text or other editors do out of the box, you have to spend <i>months</i> tweaking vim. This makes it irrelevant for the vast, vast majority of people, which is unfortunate, because it has text-editing capabilites that are simply unsurpassed by any other editor.",1351626019

The only thing that makes loudspeakers viable really is our uncanny ability to make sense of room acoustical distortions. Thus, we can sense the true sound even though it has been mangled by echos, reverberations and room modes.<p>However, we can still hear the distortion--and much more so than the comparatively small distortions introduced by sources, amplifiers or cables.<p>The thing is, if you really want some stellar sound from your home stereo, it does not make much sense to spend more than a couple thousand bucks on audio equipment without significantly improving your room acoustics. A $1000 sound system in a good room will always outperform any system in a bad room. So if you really want to improve your sound, you should probably look into room acoustical measures.<p>I have heard some > $40k sound systems in purpose-built rooms. The result is really amazing. If you close your eyes, even a trained ear will have difficulties discerning the recording from the original. In one recording studio, they had a $100k sound system. However, they also had a room to match it: The room was physically decoupled from the outside world (the whole room was standing on rubber feet, so to speak), it had special double windows, a purpose-built air conditioning and above all, loads of sound absorbing material and architecture.<p>And frankly, if you really are serious about sound quality, this is the kind of effort you have to make in order to get there. Spending the same money on more expensive speakers won't help.",1351625850

4719105,comment,4718088,4718429,43,0,brigade,,,"One good thing about 64-bit ARM is that there are no optional extensions (yet...) Floating-point and SIMD support are both required.<p>As for your library, ignore CPU models to start with. Instead, look at the ARM architecture reference manual for a given revision; it will say which instructions are supported and which extensions are optional. Also the quick reference [1] which has a good summary of when various core instructions were added. Then test for the instructions you actually care about.<p>You can safely ignore Thumb; it's an alternate encoding with tradeoffs that made sense nearly two decades ago but not anymore. You can also mostly ignore Thumb-2; there are processors that only support Thumb-2 but they also lack MMUs. Thumb-2 added some additional ARM instructions that can be useful, however.<p>So essentially, (with each revision including the prior)<p><pre><code>    ARMv4   : baseline
    ARMv5E  : Load/store double, more multiply instructions, prefetch, bx <reg>
    ARMv6   : DSP extensions, rev, load/store exclusive
    ARMv6T2 : Thumb-2, movw/movt, bitfield manipulation, rbit, orn
    ARMv7-A : Memory barriers
</code></pre>
Thumb was optional in v4 and v5, and mandatory in v6. VFP was optional as of ARMv6, NEON optional as of ARMv7. NEON mandates VFP. Revisions of VFP and NEON aren't terribly important, except that VFPv3 (but not VFPv3-d16) gets 32 registers.<p>As for chip to care about, ARMv6 + VFP (ARM1176jzf-s), ARMv7-A + VFPv3-d16 (Tegra 2), and ARMv7-A + NEON are by far the most common for general purpose stuff. If you want to get old-school, test a SheevaPlug for ARMv5E and an old PDA for ARMv4, though I'd not worry too much about ARMv4 (llvm for instance requires a baseline of ARMv5E last I checked.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001l/QRC0001_UAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001l/QR...</a>",1351625806

When actively listening to music without other distractions, the distortion in low-end systems becomes very apparent and detracts from the experience.<p>When listening to music in the background and while doing other things (cleaning the house, cooking, driving, socializing with others, working out at the gym, etc), distortion is easily lost in other background noises (and you're not paying as much attention to it anyway). For a lot of people, I think this is the only way they ever listen to music, and so it's understandable why they wouldn't see the value in higher quality components.<p>For someone like yourself, who will actively listen to music without other distractions, it makes sense to spend a few thousand dollars for a better experience.

Yet, I have to disagree.  Its not that I believe that a $4k power cord has any/significant technical advantage over a $4 power cord.  You used the words 'feels' and 'important'.  The feeling of listening to a $4k power cord is clearly internal and subjective as is the determination of its importance.  If the listener 'feels' that the $4k cord makes a difference, makes the experience better, then it has value to them and I think that they certainly have the freedom to assign how much importance it has.  If audio is your passion, then perhaps there is real value, if perhaps only symbolically, to devoting large sums of cash to it in tribute.  In my experience, audiophiles aren't simply gullible rich guys mindlessly blowing money on $4k power cords.  Many have very deep relationships with music and with their stereo equipment.  This relationship is often complex and rich enough that spending large amounts of money on a new 'X' would almost be like purchasing your wife a gold bracelet.  Almost.",1351625039

I was expecting it to be a framework, and was trying to figure out what I was missing.  If the answer is (and others have already said this is the case) ""its just a design to copy"" that's fine.

This is true unless you can't pay, in which case you will still be treated and the taxpayer will foot the bill under EMTALA.<p>So the argument goes that, given that the taxpayer is already responsible for unbounded medical expenses for everyone, it would be reasonable to compel everyone to buy prepaid health plans.  In order to compel people to buy these, they must be available to everyone, so the government must also prevent insurance companies from refusing to sell prepaid health plans to people who are certain to use them.  I use the phrase ""prepaid health plan"" rather than ""insurance,"" because insurance is purchased to protect against future risk, but a prepaid health plan will cover things that occurred in the past and things that are not risks but certainties.<p>It's a pretty sound argument as long as you don't ask ""Why is the taxpayer responsible for unbounded medical expenses for everyone?""",1351623743

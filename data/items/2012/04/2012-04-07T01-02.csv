3809683,comment,3808194,3809566,3,0,spacemanaki,,,"Regarding Clojure and JLine and the general niceness of REPLs, honestly I thinks it's a bit of a distraction. You don't need JLine at all, if you want to run a Clojure REPL in xterm or Terminal.app, just use rlwrap.<p>Most people who end up doing serious Clojure development move on to something more integrated, like SLIME for Emacs, slimv or the screen hacks you mentioned for vim, or Counterclockwise for Eclipse. I would much prefer the Clojure/core devs work on making Clojure awesome than re-inventing readline.<p>Anyway, once you've used the SLIME analogue for your language of choice, where you can select regions of code in your editor buffer for evaluation, copying and pasting to and from a REPL seems rather quaint.<p>I agree somewhat that first impressions are important, but I think that most programmers spend more time thinking than writing code, and that's especially true when you're first learning a language, and it's a big shift from that languages you know. I don't think that unfamiliarity with the tooling should be this big turn off, yet everyone makes it out to be one. When I started learning Clojure, my first impressions were based on the features of the language, and that's way more interesting than the fact that clj is a bit raw and rough around the edges.",1333763213

3809638,comment,3809221,3809576,5,0,justinsb,,,"Very interesting - thanks!  I look forward to seeing more open-source contributions from DotCloud.<p>This does come out of the experience of running FathomDB, so it isn't an ivory-tower project.  FathomDB grappled with the fact that traditional relational databases are a terrible match for the cloud, so we've built a new database.  When it came to how to run that new database as-a-service, there was so much ""undifferentiated heavy lifting"" involved that we decided that open source was the way to go here.<p>So this _is_ the rewrite that comes from the real-world experience of running a production service.  And there will be at least one real service, charging real money, and supporting real customers, built on it.  But the secret sauce of FathomDB isn't the ""aaS"" bit of ""DBaaS"" - it's the ""DB"".  By open sourcing PlatformLayer, we're hoping the community will share some of the work of ""the aaS end"", but even if not, PlatformLayer will be solving the problem for real.<p>And if that encourages you to open-source DotCloud, and if that replaces PlatformLayer, we all win.

9060268,comment,9058357,9059575,0,0,kyllo,,,"I&#x27;ve noticed a slight backlash against the IPA style and its overpowering bitterness lately. A lot of craft breweries are now selling lots of other styles, like Pilsners, subtler pale ales, wheat beers, and maltier red and brown ales, porters and stouts. Ninkasi is one of my favorite breweries, their oatmeal stout and double red ale are fantastic. They have a few good lager/pilsner styles too.<p>IPAs are relatively easy to get right, but subtler styles like pilsner require more precision in the brewing process.",1424138351

9060232,comment,9057996,9058952,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"Yes, educating workers makes them more valuable. I agree.<p>No, the fact that a worker is more valuable does not mean they will get paid more. &quot;More valuable&quot; only implies a larger upper bound for what the company would be willing to pay were the employee&#x27;s skills very scarce. However, almost by definition this is not the case for the majority of the labor market: supply and demand have a much larger effect on wages than productivity. Note how productivity has been rising at the same time as wages have been falling in, IIRC, the lower 90% of US household incomes, so this isn&#x27;t just a theoretical distinction. For most people in the US it&#x27;s a harsh reality. It is indicative of our fortunate positioning wrt supply/demand that we can even entertain the thought of getting paid in proportion to the value we create.<p>Small changes in supply/demand can have disproportionate effects on price, so adding a seemingly modest number of educated people to the market could theoretically send aggregate wages tanking far below where they were originally even if each and every employee was individually more valuable to their employer.

They keep Snowden safe and sound. The US threatens any nation in the world that doesn&#x27;t fall into line. When they thought Snowden was on board an official  government aircraft, they had their cronies in Europe force it down in violation of international law. Think that the European nations make their own decisions? Think again.<p>This is the threat that the US poses to the world, and most of the world is already under their control. Iran isn&#x27;t, so they are threatened with war. They&#x27;ve been threatened with war since Bush&#x27;s idiotic &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; speech. Since before that. You think they don&#x27;t have the right to try to defend themselves? To prevent that? Nuclear weapons, in this world, bring freedom. See how North Korea has never been invaded. See how the US knows better than to engage Russia in outright conflict. Nations that have nuclear weapons can have actual independence.<p>With the Trans-Pacific Partnership, they are trying to force their laws onto the entire world, and that is just one of many such agreements. Canada is already a puppet state of the US. The current state of the world is that no nation can try to free themselves of US influence without getting an internal revolution or even an outright invasion, and that is a much bigger threat than Russia is, or China, or Iran, or anyone.",1424137087

9060159,comment,9059906,9060082,0,0,Lazare,,,"Complicated topic; a couple ways of approaching it.<p>One way is to say this:  All countries (and regions) have periodic downturns.  When this happens you either have fiscal flows from richer to poorer regions (the US does this), or you have currency devaluation (the EU prior to the Euro did this).  After the Euro, the EU was still reluctant to have straight up fiscal flows (if the EU worked the way the US works, Germany would straight up fund Greek unemployment benefits).  But with a shared currency, currency devaluation was also not possible.  This left only one answer:  So called internal devaluation.  The standard neoliberal textbook answer is &quot;don&#x27;t ever do this, it&#x27;s slow, terrible, and doesn&#x27;t really work&quot;, but Greece had no other options.  (Krugman is quoted at the link; in this he speaks for the neoliberal consensus.)<p>You ask why you shouldn&#x27;t think of Greece is a deadbeat; the answer is the same reason why you shouldn&#x27;t think of Alaska as a deadbeat, or the north of England as a deadbeat (both relatively poorer regions of larger nations which are net recipients of government transfers); because they&#x27;re people suffering from an economic downturn largely beyond their control, and they need help.  Greece didn&#x27;t need (or deserve) <i>loans</i>, they needed <i>aid</i>...or a devaluation.  Since aid was politically impossible, and devaluation legally impossible, they got loans.  Which they couldn&#x27;t pay back, which forced them to make cuts which deepened the problem.  To the surprise of no one, really, but what else could be done?  Even Krugman never identified a politically and legalally feasible alternative.<p>Another approach is to focus on your question &quot;If Greece was given a clean slate, would it be a healthy, productive and growing economy?&quot;  The answer is &quot;yes of course&quot;.  Until Syriza came to power Greece was running a &quot;primary surplus&quot; (that means their budget balanced if you don&#x27;t count interest); that means that if they simply defaulted they would be, economically, fine.  Greece doesn&#x27;t (or didn&#x27;t, but we&#x27;ll come to that in a moment) need to borrow to fund ongoing government operations; they only need to borrow to fund repayments of the money they already borrowed.  And again, they were forced to borrow, because the options that would normally be open (aid or devaluation) were closed to them.<p>(Note:  Greece hasn&#x27;t run a primary surplus the last two months because tax receipts crashed on the election of Syriza.  Syriza ran against some of the more onerous taxes, and people stopped paying them on the assumption that they would soon be repealed, or at least unenforced.  Ironically, this means that the election of Syriza has made the bargaining position of Greece&#x27;s Syriza-led government much worse; the last government could credibly tell the markets to jump off a cliff, but the current one needs to continue borrowing to avoid a crisis.  Not the first political party to be hamstrung by their own election promises, but it&#x27;s rarely so severe.)<p>Anyhow, when you say &quot;Maybe that ought to be the reality for Greece?&quot;, what you&#x27;re really discussing is a devaluation, where a nation collectively realises they aren&#x27;t quite as rich as they thought, and scales all their expectations down.  A salary that might have stretched to a new Lexus now only stretches to a new Toyota, or whatever.  Devaluations are normal and healthy; southern European countries devaluated their currencies over and over and over again in the post WWII years.  Greece should have done that at the start of the global financial crisis; they should probably do that now.<p>There&#x27;s just one problem:  They can&#x27;t do it, because they&#x27;re part of the euro.  Or rather, they <i>can</i>, but rather than it just being a matter of the drachma/deutchmark exchange rate shifting a bit, and everyone&#x27;s drachma salaries being worth less, while all the tourist&#x27;s pounds and marks are worth a bit more, with everyone&#x27;s mortgages, employment contracts, pensions, etc. being left alone, Greece now faces the reality of an internal devaluation, where everything has to change in a brutal, grinding process.  (Edit:  Devaluing the currency would also decrease the loan burden; they could just print drachma to pay back the German loans.  Which they can&#x27;t do now, because they don&#x27;t have the drachma.  My point is its all linked; Greece has much less control over their finances than we would expect a &quot;real&quot; country to have, and all the obvious answers that countries all over the world have used and continue to use are closed to them.  Personally, I struggle not to be sympathetic.  The US and the UK don&#x27;t—in fact, can&#x27;t—face a problem like Greece faces, because they still have printing presses.)<p>(Again, US states face the same issue, but the US has a strong federal government that transfers enormous quantities of money between regions.  The EU, in comparison, is tiny.  And incompetent.  And (arguably) dominated by Germany.)<p>TL;DR:  Joining the euro removed every existing easy or painless way to fix the problem, but didn&#x27;t add any new methods.  You can blame Greece for joining the euro all those years ago, but once they did, the problems were set in stone.  Calling them deadbeats now isn&#x27;t really accurate, but worse, it&#x27;s pointless.<p>Ninja edit:  Or, of course, Greece could exit the Euro.  But that cure might be worse than the disease.  Then again, there may no longer be any other options.  We live in interesting times.",1424136790

Greece the country didn&#x27;t borrow all (or even most) of that money, private borrowers borrowed it from German banks (or Greek banks that borrowed it from German banks). The money ended up as public debt because the banks got bailed out.<p>The reasons for this were complex, but had a lot of do with German fiscal and labor policy. Once the loans turned out to be bad (because why on Earth did the banks expect that all of these funds could possibly to put to good, productive use, especially once credit standards were lowered), Greece was expected to deal with the situation. They did, and they bankrupted the country doing so (same with Portugal, Spain, and Ireland).<p>There is, of course, plenty of blame to go around, but this <i>is not</i> a situation where the Greek government borrowed a ton of money and wasted it. They borrowed a ton of money to bail out their banking system <i>including</i> a bunch of German banks (which is where a lot of the money originated). This is exactly what the global economic elites were telling everyone to do in 2008. Then, once things got ugly, those same elites decided that the Greek people should collectively pay the price for two bad economic policies that were only partially the fault of their government.<p>Suggested reading:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/dp/019982830X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/d...</a> - this book goes into great depth about what exactly happened in Europe.<p><a href=""http://blog.mpettis.com/2015/02/syriza-and-the-french-indemnity-of-1871-73/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mpettis.com/2015/02/syriza-and-the-french-indemn...</a> - blog post that describes how what has happened in Greece, Spain, and Portugal was effectively inevitable and not the fault of the respective governments so much as it was a result of a series of pan-European financial blunders.",1424136609

For some types of questions, it helps to make that explicit.<p>For instance, in weak axiom systems, we can&#x27;t prove that every hydra game terminates. [0] In very strong axiom systems, ones so strong we call them inconsistent, we can prove everything! People argue over intermediate systems sometimes by pointing out things they can prove that are counter-intuitive. [1][2]<p>For any terminating Turing machine, there is a (possibly very long) proof in a very weak axiom system of that fact: the full trace of the execution. (For non-terminating machines, this is not true.) So, if ZFC, a rather strong axiom system, cannot prove a machine halts, it does not halt.<p>For another example of this kind of thing, see Terry Tao&#x27;s discussion of the consequences of the independence of Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture from ZFC on MathOverflow.

Both of us are young lawyers in our early 30s with experience in patent law and business law. My personal background is with business law, business entity formation, and real estate law. My friend is a member of the patent bar with a CS Bachelor&#x27;s Degree. Both of us have extensive tech background. We are also thinking about bringing a partner on board to handle immigration cases.<p>So, basically, the law firm would offer 1) patent services, 2) business entity formation services, and 3) immigration services.  We think that immigration practice would fit in well because many tech companies are looking to bring in foreign talent on work visas.<p>This would be a big move for both of us, so I wanted to see if the HN community could give us some feedback. Assuming that we can provide competent and reasonably priced service to the tech community, would this be something start up companies would be interested in? Our network in the startup community isn’t very broad either. We believe that we can provide excellent service that would generate referrals, but at the beginning, do you have any suggestions on how to generate clients?<p>Any ideas would help. Also, if you guys think that this is a really dumb idea that would never work for some reason, please let us know as well. My main concern is that the kind of companies we would like to target wouldn’t consider us because they would rather go with a more prestigious, larger firm. I fervently believe that we can provide the same, and probably higher level of service, to our clients because of our small size and our tech backgrounds. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that other people will see it that way.<p>Thanks for reading!",1424135216

Although obviously some people either incorrectly assessed their threats, and need to upgrade them, or were careless and need to be more careful...<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/thisworldofours.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/thisworld...</a>",1424134879

Perhaps they aren&#x27;t over-valuing hype per se, but instead valuing companies they think will be successful. Many companies that will succeed happen to have a lot of hype (although obviously hype isn&#x27;t the best indicator).",1424134858

When you get rid of the alcohol subsidizing the food cost, suddenly finding dirt cheap food was harder.",1424134832

That way, numbers like Graham&#x27;s number can be submitted despite there being no physical way to represent the number in decimal (in the observable Universe).",1424134826

Descartes is thought provoking. Islam and the rest are barbaric and thrive on ignorance, not enlightenment. They are hate pieces that are contextual to the era they were written,not by &quot;a creator&quot; but by men.<p>But I must admit, Islam is a little more perfect than the other two, as the ethnocentrism of Judaism and the gross absurdity of trinity will not stand that longer. The fact that it tries,however to build up on the other two doesn&#x27;t save it, from a meta-physical point of view.<p>Logic teaches us than building something on absurdity only leads to more absurdity.",1424134806

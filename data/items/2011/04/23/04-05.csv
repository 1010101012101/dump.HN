Stateless object cannot have cycles (since you can't construct them in stateless objects, unless you're in a lazy language), and so reference counting can be used for stateless objects. Stateful objects, which can have cycles, are managed by the garbage collector.<p>Rust sounds like a really interesting idea, and I'd love to give it a try, but sadly it's still in the ""some assembly required"" stage as they work on bootstrapping it so the only real projects that are worthwhile to do with it yet are helping out with the bootstrapping process.",1303531871

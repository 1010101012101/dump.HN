> <i>because anyone who's actually been to Japan can tell you that it's not the least bit futuristic anymore</i>
...
> <i>the Japanese have by and large failed to understand or grasp the digital revolution.</i><p>... is quite silly.<p>Japanese society's adoption of tech advances, as far as I can tell, is neither particularly advanced, nor particularly backwards compared to other societies.  The <i>details</i> differ, so from certain narrow perspectives it may appear as either.  It's simply a different place, and simplistic comparisons (""more"" or ""less"") don't capture much.  I know when I visit my relatives in America (I've lived in Japan since the '90s), walking about town there's a definite perception that not a whole lot has changed since about 1950, even in the richest and most urbane areas, because American society is both rather conservative and kind of cheap; Japan is a whole different story, because they <i>love</i> ""new"".<p>In terms of <i>industry</i>, the stereotypical Japanese style of working, which favors continual incremental advances and attention to detail (sort of a ""craftsman's"" approach) over large but disruptive leaps and fixation on ""the big picture"", is fundamentally sort of conservative, and this is not well-suited to very fast-changing tech nor to software (where avoiding big changes inevitability leads to massive unmaintainable heaps of bit-rotting code...).  This factor affect big companies (a mainstay of Japanese industry) more than small ones, because big companies <i>also</i> have the usual bureaucratic overhead, but it's a cultural artifact, and can be seen everywhere.<p>In addition, a big damper on Japanese software has been the relative isolation of Japanese software developers from the west, where much of the important research and development is happening.  There's <i>some</i> interaction, but the Japanese are often a conspicuous absence in forums with otherwise international participation, despite a large domestic software industry.  As far as I can tell, this stems in large part from a simple lack of confidence in English: Europeans are willing to participate even if their English is pretty shaky (it may be a chore, but it gets the job done), but Japanese are not, even when they have a fairly workable grasp of English.  I know <i>many</i> Japanese whose English is perfectly acceptable when they're forced to use it, but they're absolutely loathe to do so unless forced.<p>The Japanese software developers I've talked to about such things are perfectly aware of these issues.  But awareness, unfortunately, is not enough to change the system, at least quickly.<p>Things will work out in the end, I'm pretty sure, because the competence and work-ethic of Japanese software developers in general seems pretty good (many of those I know are top-notch); but before that comes the pain...",1350952755

For example, one common definition of heritability, the one given by Wikipedia as a matter of fact, has a very important twist:  ""The heritability of a trait <i>within a population</i> is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals <i>within a population</i> that is due to genetic differences.""  In this definition, heritability explicitly depends on the choice of population.  For example, if North and South Korea are considered as a single population, you will get a different result than if they are considered separately.  It's easy to misuse population-specific measures of heritability to make inappropriate cross-population comparisons.  For example, if intelligence is highly heritable among native-born Dutch and highly heritable among native-born Croats, it might seem reasonable to conclude that IQ differences between Dutch and Croats must be genetic.  Yet the same argument would show that the difference in height between North Korea (where height is presumably highly heritable <i>within the population</i>) and South Korea (ditto) must be genetic.",1350951532

The vast majority (i.e., >95%) of India lives in what would be considered dire poverty in the US. Upper class individuals in the poshest suburbs of Mumbai suffer living conditions comparable to the poorest housing projects in the US. All we need to do to lift them from poverty is allow them to enter the US and provide us cheap medical services, clean our houses and the like.""
</code></pre>
This is nonsense--the idea that somehow transplanting these people to the US will magically create wealth. ""Aha!"" we say,"" This fellow was in the top quartile of his former economy--let us bring him into the United States so he may be worth more as a member of our top quartile!"". That's rubbish.<p>Moreover, the ""cheap medical"" bit isn't correct. It's not labor shortages that are causing all the runaway costs in healthcare, and to pretend that bringing over physicians will somehow improve our situation (without explicitly saying <i></i>how<i></i>) is just wishful thinking.<p>There is still more issue with ""Oh, well, they can do menial jobs and suchlike, and clean our houses."" We already have folks for that--normal immigrants and illegals, no less--and additionally it creates yet more lower class issues. The problems we have with the economic gap here persist and are worsened by this sort of thinking, regardless of any absolute scale of poverty.<p>And then, the signals bit.<p>If you want to talk about signals, observe the point--however odious it may be--that a reliable signal we have from the poor is that they both are unskilled enough not to be desirable additions to our economy and irresponsible enough to continue breeding and voting. I can support this signal however you'd like with a straight face.<p>Signals, sir, are whatever you interpret them to be, regardless of origin or intent.<p>Compare that with another signal from illegals here--that they care enough about quality of life, for themselves and their children, that they'll willingly do whatever it takes to become part of the economy and community (note that I did not say <i></i>citizenry<i></i>, as they do not use official channels to becomes citizens).<p>~<p>All this annoyance aside, I'd much rather see an attempt to upgrade their countries and societies in place than flood our own lower classes with more immigrants, especially if we can't even come to terms with existing problems like our resident illegal alien population.<p>The fact that the two of you have made such observations about the illegal immigrants tells me that we've a ways to go before we should even consider helping out people abroad.",1350951210

Somewhere on the Tesla website there is a cute little calculator that will tell you how long it takes to fully charge the Model S with the various charging adapters.  As I recall, the 110V / 12A outlet takes something like 4 or 5 days.   That's fast enough that most people could probably keep their drive-to-work car at a mid-range SoC by charging all night and while at work.

They are worried that the limit it sets for blood THC levels for DUI is below the level found in the blood of medical marijuana users. Many medical users would basically be unable to legally drive.

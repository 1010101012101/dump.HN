To me, parenting often feels like walking a tightrope: you have to preserve a delicate balance between presenting the world as it should be and presenting it as it is. The former is meant to instill values, the latter is meant to prepare and protect. Too much of the former sets the kid up for a huge disappointment. Too much of the latter would be crushing.<p>That&#x27;s why I would love to see a game like this, a game that addresses the problem, but ultimately remains a game you can have fun with. The best works I&#x27;ve ever read/seen/played are subtle: they don&#x27;t shove their ideas down your throat, but make you think about their nuances later.",1405533585

8043453,comment,8042451,8043010,7,0,anigbrowl,,,"When I was a kid I got books from the library too. Then, like most people who enjoy reading, I began buying books of my own. Libraries are fine when you just want to find some books you haven&#x27;t read before but owning your own books has significant advantages, which I hope need not be restated here.<p>How this goes for authors depends on how Amazon are purchasing the rights to the ebooks. Having seen what streaming has done to music revenue I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too optimistic about this. Some authors will do fantastically well, of course, but the much larger number of people who make a modest income from writing may well see it shrink drastically. The problem is that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily improve things for consumers. Super-successful authors are often producers of lowest-common-denominator material. If high quality writers who appeal to a much smaller audience are no longer able to support themselves by writing, then they either move downmarket or take up another line of work, which results is a loss of quality for consumers.<p>The problem with streaming is that proponents treat creative output like a commodity and then point to the laws of supply and demand to justify economic upheaval. But pure supply and demand only applies in cases of perfect competition, where commodity goods are actually perfect substitutes; I have no particular reason to buy oil/ gravel/ corn from supplier X if supplier Y can deliver identical goods at a lower price. This is not the case for creative works.<p>PS I don&#x27;t mean this as a dig against Amazon in particular, but there is a potential monopsony problem. I worry about this a bit less with Netflix because the economics of film production and distribution are enormously different than for other media, and Netflix is more like a peer among distributors.",1405533529

The woman in this case went to the police in order to ask them if it was possible to force a person to take a HIV test. While there she explain how she was half-asleep when Assange initiated un-safe sex, and when she heard about his other sexual partners a few days later she became concerned. When she contacted Assange about a HIV test, he brushed the concept off, which is why she were there at the police station asking them for help.<p>The result was by all reports (ie news papers), not what she wanted. They charged Assange for rape, which resulted in that she broke of any communication with the police and prosecutor, and refused to sign the written report from the police station.<p>Now, criminal case do not need that the woman agree with the charges, but it makes for a strange case. It also makes one ask for whose benefit this case is all for. All the men and women who is half-asleep when initiated by sex from a partner they previously that day/night had sex with?",1405533477

Even as an adult, the movie is great. It perfectly captures the intensities and subtleties of the social hierarchy at a large public school; it’s akin to prison.<p>&quot;And for anyone who has gone to a large public school then you know that it is likely the closest thing to prison you will ever experience (and because of that, you are my brother). I was at the mercy of the hierarchy but then of course ritually enforced it. Nothing ever mean or nasty but there were circles and power, mystique around certain cliques and I respected it. We chased that power, reacted against it, then exerted it.<p>&quot;That power between social groups in school, it never breaks down neatly as it does in the other teen comedies. It’s not the nerds versus jocks. The jocks usually didn’t have enough charisma to be truly popular. It was always the dual edged, cross pollenating ones that carried the most glamour. The jock-stoner; the hot-nerd; the dangerous-attractive dude-who graduated but you would still blow; the shady mean girls who were the ultimate enforcers of social power — they come in many forms, sometimes even in overalls.&quot;",1405533464

Amazon has historically appeared to support these library programs, presumably because they make kindles more appealing to the core &quot;book purchasing&quot; demographic as well.<p>In the near future I hope to have limited access to all these books for free, or unlimited access for $9.99 a month, and the ability to easily switch between the two consumption models. That, for me, would be an easy sell. This is pretty much how i consume Hulu - most of the time, I just want to watch recent episodes of the Daily Show and am satisfied with the free tier. And when I want to get after specific content, I bump up to the paid tier for a bit.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why &quot;some content is always free&quot; model isn&#x27;t more popular in the content world. If Netflix offered something like three free movies a month, I would never &quot;cancel&quot; my account. They would get better brand loyalty, better app lock-in, and lower customer churn. Instead, I get annoyed at the always-on subscription model and cycle between subscribed and unsubscribed.<p>Digitization of content changed distribution patterns, which changed pricing patterns, and the combination of both changed consumption patterns. It feels like there is a feedback loop where now it makes sense for pricing and user management (acquisition, retention) strategies to adapt once again, this time to changes in user behavior and consumption patterns.",1405533259

Authors do the exact opposite and do numerous free events in hopes that it attracts people to purchase their books.  I wonder if this will change over time or if these business models are caused by the inherit value of the content vs experience of each form of art.  Stand up comedy probably exists in the middle ground of the two regarding the value of the content vs experience and standups generally follow the musician business model of giving the content away to attract people to their live events.",1405531440

I can recall two incidents of physical bullying. One was two bullies blocking my path to the school with their bikes (I drove into them full speed which made them call me crazy and go away), and one was the same two bullies taking away my backpack and throwing it down a bridge.<p>Also, I find the way you discount non-physical bullying extremely troubling. No, you can’t just ignore mean words if that means isolating yourself from many vital social interactions. It’s not like you have much choice on who to interact with in school. You will be together with those people, you can’t flee it, you can’t close your ears. They can get to you if they want to.<p>This pervasive violence must be an American thing or something, or maybe it’s a class thing in Germany (where I grew up, middle class, school that directly qualifies you for university)? It just never happened to me at all.<p>I also don’t have a solution when you are being bullied. For me it just stopped at a certain point. Bullies turned into people who just left me alone. They didn’t want to have anything to do with my, but they also didn’t bully me at all. I think they grew out of it and it had nothing to do with me at all, only them.<p>(Hm, maybe I should add an example of emotional bullying to balance out the descriptions of physical bullying: We were on this trip to Berlin in the huge lobby of the foreign ministry and a kid was driving around the huge space, all alone, on his tiny tricycle. I was really into photography at the time and this made a great motive, so I snapped a few photos … which lead one bully to constantly call me a pedophile for the next two years or so. He even managed to sneakily and in an obscure way put a reference to that in our graduation newspaper. That’s emotional bullying and it was much worse for me than any physical bullying I ever received. Also, hard to ignore. We were lining up to get security checked before going into the ministry, so hardly a place where I could ignore him. Also, am I supposed to ignore our graduation newspaper?)",1405531131

Why do you think it has the volume it already has today? So free trade rhetoric is misplaced here. What TTIP is about is about regulations, for example concerning food or medicine, patent and copyright laws, etc. And I, for one, abhor US patent laws, or their blatant and complete disregard for the environment or animal beings, etc. I don&#x27;t want your crap food here, your GMO conglomerates, or your patent lawyers.

Sure, do what you want, you can have your &quot;standards&quot; at your side of the Atlantic and continue to get reamed by your political elite and Washington lawyers.

What is more, let&#x27;s go with it and assume it came to pass -- GDP miraculously increased by what they said it would as a result. What about the costs incurred in terms of loss of (even more) control over our food supply chain, increase in health care costs, more draconian imposition of your patent and copyright laws, etc etc.<p>Nobody with a job and not a specialist can be reasonably expected to get to know in detail what such agreements entails.

They could also keep prices higher than the current ones. They absolutely failed by sticking to old ways.<p>Customers finally got what they were asking for for a decade and now people act surprised it&#x27;s a good business causing race to the bottom. It will sort itself out if it&#x27;s unsustainable. Interesting bands will likely create a new service, offering streaming at higher prices with more profits going to them at some point.<p>If some band wants to get paid above the streaming rate, they should publish their album for direct download - people will buy it if they&#x27;re good enough.",1405530325

If i knew myself, the only thing i would be able to tell myself is, it&#x27;s going to suck until you&#x27;re halfway through college.<p>Bullies, at least the best ones, don&#x27;t leave you alone. They don&#x27;t leave you alone if your confident, they don&#x27;t leave you alone if you&#x27;re hurt. They just don&#x27;t care. They have either yet to learn empathy, or are simply sociopaths and you&#x27;re simply a fixture in their lives, entertainment.<p>Now, assuming this is the case, which it was for me. You have a choice. Make a game that is a bit dark, existential, cathartic, or simply make a game that tells us to believe the nonsense that we are told to tell ourselves: be confident, give your bully the &quot;i&#x27;m not a chicken, you&#x27;re a turkey&quot; speech, excel and you&#x27;ll get respect.<p>I think if you want to make a truly interesting game, ignore the uplifting nonsense and go for the catharsis. It gets better when you&#x27;re able to choose your friends, your you&#x27;re able to make friends on your own terms, not just pick from those around you.<p>If i were going to make a game like this i would have aspects like:<p>* Having a good cry shouldn&#x27;t be in game death, it should be a power up.<p>* Being vulnerable and hurt and carrying on regardless should be strength.<p>When i started making friends in upper level classes in college, i was able to be friends with people that saw the world in interesting ways, and cared about things that made sense. We had mutual respect, and that was that. The nasty politics of social groups has rarely ever crept into my life since.",1405530310

Due to its far-flung nature, it cost British Empire a LOT of money to keep the war effort going, and moreover at a time when they were hurting for cash (since this was just after the Seven Year&#x27;s War with France).  The Americans and French were able to make it too costly for Britain to continue to hold on to the colonies.<p>Britain also tried to take America back in the War of 1812, but was again thwarted by the costs of maintaining a war abroad (and the war had come to a stalemate by 1814).<p>Unlike most revolutions we see today (which are revolutions at home, and become civil wars if they turn violent), the American Revolution succeeded through violence because it was against a foreign adversary and because the Americans were able to make it too costly for Britain to maintain their war effort.  These preconditions do not apply to local revolutions, where no side has an economic incentive to stop fighting until the other sides are crushed.  Each factions&#x27; lives are on the line, largely eliminating the cost consideration.

The reality is that no, a service does not have a right to collect data about you. The service provider may ask that you provide certain data to use the service, but that collection is not a right.<p>> It only becomes an issue when the company behind that service has its hand in many pies and correlates all of the related data, or worse, if they share or sell that data to other entities.<p>The notion that one has a right to collect data from users of a service is the same notion that says the service provider has ownership of that data. But this is faulty, the data is not owned by the service provider, it was merely collected and stored. This distinction is important: if you feel you own the data, you feel that you should be able to sell it. If you feel you are a custodian of data, then you are defaulting to protecting that data from others that a user never agreed to give it to in the first place.",1405530102

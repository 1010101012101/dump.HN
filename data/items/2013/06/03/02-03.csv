Could also end up inhibiting his executive function and turning him into a heroin addict.<p>The formula for success is multiplicative: Ability * Motivation * Opportunity.<p>If any one of those factors is zero, success is zero despite how much of the others you have. The thing about forcing kids to do their homework is there's no such thing as a free lunch. Whatever you gain in terms of extra external opportunity may be easily offset (and then some) by reductions in intrinsic motivation, executive function, etc. Or not. The point is that it's a wicked problem[1], and as such there isn't any simple and/or one-size-fits-all solution. Keep in mind also that doing well is largely beneficial because it gives you more opportunities to do various things. But thanks to new social structures that are being built on top of the Internet, those sorts of opportunities are becoming less and less valuable every day. While having them will always be better than not having them, it may no longer make sense to optimize for them either, especially when you're young enough to have a decades-long arc.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem</a>",1370227700

5810954,comment,5810890,5810890,1,0,hardwaresofton,,,"Semi-full disclosure: I was a UT Austin student, just graduated with a CS degree, Hook 'em<p>TLDR @ bottom<p>So you seem to have a really solid plan for your life, but in my humble opinion, college isn't even about learning, for the most part. It's really about social interaction. You will pretty much never get the same chance at unbridled continuous social interaction as college provides. Putting a bunch of post-pubescent ""young-adults"" in the same central location for 4 or so years allows for a lot of crazy things, but more importantly, a lot of bonds, experiences, etc.<p>That said, you will also never get the same opportunities in college as you're going to get abroad. You'll meet really awesome, interesting people (hopefully), and have a ton of great times. However, the context in which you meet those people and explore those countries is completely different.<p>Let me illustrate (and hopefully make my point more believable) with an example. I have studied abroad in Japan -- it is by far the easiest, most carefree way to get there, and stay there (if only for a while). I speak pretty good japanese, but what stuck with me most is that the country can be VERY lonely if you don't have some way to make friends (this applies to any country), and the social skills you learn in college go a LONG way in making that easier, and if you had gone in college, that same young-people-in-an-enclosed-area dynamic would have done wonders in gathering people around you that were similar, and you could easily befriend. When I studied abroad, I met people from ALL over (london,ireland,germany,vietnam,china,korea,americans,spanish), and many of them I actually still like and maintain contact with. My fear is that you won't have such a good chance of that experience by getting out of college so early /quickly.<p>At this point, there's not really much you can do about that, though I would suggest that somehow you utilize the school to travel. It will be much cheaper, and much more manageable, you'll have more resources, etc.<p>Also, on a less touchy-feely note, you should have stuck it out for that CS degree. UT Austin is a pretty highly ranked CS school, and the curriculum really isn't even impossible. It's super doable, and if you can stick out (and learn) the theory, the degree is worth alot (trust me, I'm very very comfortably employed now, and it wasn't very hard).<p>Also, to accomplish your goal, there are a lot of people who do the whole work-x-months, travel-x-months. If you are up front with this, you might be able to find some companies who really need help, and they will hire you. Of course, this would be easier with a CS degree.<p>In general -- you know what you want, which is good (I've never not known what I wanted either, all I ever wanted was to program computers) -- but be careful not to miss out on the stuff that you didn't know you wanted. My parents are the ones that pushed me to go abroad (literally, they wanted me to just ""go somewhere"", while I was in school because they know the school would help subsidize and stabilize everything), and they were so right in their decision, as parents often are. On paper, the decision looks like a bad one: delay my graduation, stop me from getting on with my life for a whole year, disable me from doing any CS (there weren't any CS courses I could take while abroad). But, the experience was one I would redo every single time.<p>tl;dr College isn't about learning as much as it was about social interaction. The CS degree would have been a good idea. Using the university to travel would have also been a good idea. Going forward, finding a company that embraces your desire to travel (or finding a company in the country you want to travel to, and getting hired there) might not be as hard as you think -- but you will really have to show them your skill, since you don't have a CS degree.",1370225939

The story went something like this:<p>A group of students had just finished a big research project and were told to present a one page executive summary that outlined their work, results, and conclusions.  They couldn't quite get it to fit on one page, so their executive summary was two pages, but the second page was only 1/8th full.  No big deal, right?  They showed up to meet with the head of the company that was sponsoring their research, and handed him the paper.  He rips off the second page and throws it in the trash (losing a good portion of their conclusions).  The head of the company reads the first page, then stops and says, ""This summary is incomplete.  Where are your conclusions?""  The team was dumbfounded, and lost a few points on their grade because they didn't follow the rules.<p>The moral of the story is: FOLLOW THE G<i></i>D<i></i>* RULES.  If you want to use a different kind of paper, ask your teacher first.  If you need an extension on the due date, ask your teacher first.  If the guidance says to write a one page summary, do not write a two page summary.  It's fine to be creative, but don't change the rules on your own because you don't have the authority to change the rules.  In most things it is easier to ask permission than it is to ask forgiveness.<p>It's not unusual to not want to do homework, but a lot of people in this modern generation think that it's okay to get bad grades and just blame it on the fact that they are not ""book smart.""

As much as homework sucks, and following the rules sucks, it's something everyone has to do at some point.  Learning how to do it, and acknowledge it for what it is, is important.<p>I can remember all of about 15 days between 1st and 11th grades where I actually did <i>homework</i>, as in, did school work at home.  The rest of the time, I did whatever exercises/sheets/etc that needed to be handed in on the bus or during class before we went home.  The 15 days - I remember having to go to the library to read up on some topics to write papers, and I remember having a few essays which took a bit of time to write longhand (and eventually word processed on a computer later).<p>It wasn't until 12th grade that the assignments got hard enough that I ever struggled.  By then it was somewhat too late - I didn't have any really strong innate ability to <i>study</i> something for more than a few minutes.  Now today, that might not even matter at some level, with all answers a google away, but I think it still takes time to really study and learn a subject/problem/etc.<p>The ability to focus yourself on something - anything - and get through the hard stuff you don't care about before getting to the stuff you might enjoy - that's a discipline I didn't have, and it took me many more years to get it back, even for things I <i>wanted</i> to get more involved in.   Developing this habit/skill at a younger age <i>will</i> pay dividends, but it's hard for kids to appreciate that.  The OP's kid may be mature enough in some ways to at least consider this angle - logically - when homework comes up.  Do the stupid exercises on the size paper they want with the stupid number 2 pencil.<p>Learn to adapt to whatever requirements are put before you <i>quickly</i> and <i>with little fuss</i> - focusing on the intellectual aspects first.  As someone else mentioned, those are eventually mandatory in just about all walks of life, so learning to roll with that will help.<p>It's possibly similar to healthy eating and exercise.  Especially for kids - they can 'eat anything' and not get fat, stay thin, etc.  Eventually, that goes away, and learning to eat healthy and exercise is something you have to adapt to to remain in good health.

I don't understand your premise.<p>Do you honestly think the Basecamp homepage communicates what it is? As stated earlier, the description could apply just as well to Dropbox, MediaWiki, or Eventbrite.",1370224913

(I had mailed awesome Android app FeedMe's[1] dev and that's what he said)<p>FeedHQ started taking payments(actually became paid only) without any features or implementation which is worthwhile.<p>Feedly is plague. Ask them why they need a Firefox extension to read their website.<p>FeedBin is one that sounds sane and I am going to stick to them till others improve.<p>We don't have an option, yet!<p>Besides, in most of the blog posts and comments people were worried about a reading client than a service which(latter) IMHO was the real loss.<p>[1]<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.feedme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seazon.fee...</a>",1370224880

Before coursera exploded I had thought of doing something similar, and the eventual plan had been to provide the software to universities (for pay), but that was mainly to support the idea of great education for all.",1370224867

I don't want a replacement which makes it basically impossible to visit the site that updated (The Old Reader) and I don't want to find a mystery-meat icon among about a dozen bloody share-this-on-friendfacetwat buttons (Feedly).<p>So none of the alternatives are working for me.

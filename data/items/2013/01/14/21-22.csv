That said, it doesn't exclude the possibility of diatoms having perhaps taken a lengthy space trip at some point in their evolutionary history. It would certainly go some way to explaining why a marine species would have developed to be radiation and vacuum resistant.<p>As to siliceous rocks - possibly, although I don't believe there's been anything found to suggest diatoms in great antiquity as yet. Funnily enough the most prevalent siliceous rock is... diatomite. Your toothpaste is made out of it. Chert (flint, etc.) is probably a better candidate substrate, but again, diatoms of that age would be indistinguishable from the substrate itself. Molecular clocks could indicate a biogenic origin, but as yet there's no way to demonstrate what variety of biogenic origin.<p>There's evidence in terms of carbonaceous inclusions in ancient rocks that suggests the existence of life on earth before previously assumed - <a href=""http://courses.washington.edu/bangblue/Mojzsis-3.85Ga_Akilia_d13C-Sci96.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://courses.washington.edu/bangblue/Mojzsis-3.85Ga_Akilia...</a>, but nothing to suggest it was diatomic in nature.<p>Anyway.

For some problems that approach is way better, so it is not a question of what the best way to do this is. In fact, the code I have written in Haskell does not seem to have suffered at all, even though it was highly concurrent. Do note however, that the thing I wrote was throughput-oriented though.<p>It is not harder to do this with a compiled language. You just need to insert check points regularly in your generated code. This means you have to make sure that loops regularly checks. Some times though, you can compute the induction and then determine before loop execution if you have enough reductions left to enter the loop. If not you can jump to a slower version. Depending on the loop and architecture, incrementing a value on each iteration tend to be cheap.<p>As for the regular expressions: They are PCRE's written in C, but the library has been instrumented with points at which the computation can be stopped and preempted to avoid it to hog the core. The slowdown is very very low, but it will be split up and interleaved with other jobs.",1358198956

This has a cost: slower regular expressions because you're doing them in Erlang rather than C, and not sharing nice C implementations.

Prosecutorial and other forms of government (e.g. police, etc.) injustice are widespread and often hit the disadvantaged hardest.  It's not fair, and perhaps it is not fair that Swartz's case is receiving so much more attention.  But, it <i>is</i> receiving attention.  Including amongst people with the power (perhaps not always conventional or ""blue chip"" power) and influence to change things.<p>Maybe it can stand and serve for a call to action.  Even as the need is much deeper and much broader than this ""technology"" case of itself might indicate.<p>3)  The prosecutor, just this past week, was apparently unwilling to budge from a plea agreement targeting at least 6 or 7 years in jail.  Again, for a plea agreement, presumably with enough softening of terms over an expected judicial outcome to provide some compulsion for acceptance by the defense.  It appears that the prospect of several years of jail time, along with a lifelong, serious limiting label of ""felon"", was real.<p>[SUBSEQUENT EDIT:  Apparently, I read an incorrect description of the terms of the proffered plea agreement, or I mis-read an accurate description.  The Wall Street Journal describes ( <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324581504578238692048200404.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142412788732458150457823...</a> ) a discussion of a prosecution target of 7 years with the proffered plea agreement offering 6 - 8 <i>months</i>.  The felony conviction, however, would have apparently remained.]<p>4)  The SOPA/PIPA debacle, in which Swartz played a critical role, was a topic for widespread, public debate.  Regarding this, see again my point 1), above.<p>(The government also was effectively slapped down fairly well in the PACER fiasco, including by ""insiders"" within the judicial and academic systems who were using the PACER system out of necessity but with great resentment and its attendant financial burden.)<p>5)  I think you've misread (or failed to put adequate effort into reading) Mr. Swartz and perhaps also the community you describe.  Swartz appears to have been much more direct in and motivated by his stated interests than in any seeking of fame, particularly ""for fame's sake"".  And the community -- at least, the part I've seen -- has been fairly openly, honestly, inquisitively, and in a cautionary fashion been discussing suicide.<p>(Admittedly, I'm no expert in this either, and I'm not familiar with more than a sampling of Swartz's works (e.g. his posts and essages), so perhaps I'm wrong in this.)<p>--<p>As I've said elsewhere, Swartz's case gains much -- perhaps outsized -- attention through his prominence.  But then, so did Steve Jobs' case including his cancer and his abrasive but apparently effective personality.  As did Postel's, some years ago, when his death brought retrospective attention to his quiet but extremely efficient and effective, seemingly single-handed management of the early Internet's address space.<p>Thousands of others go through similar circumstances.  But a few seem fated to draw particular attention to them.  And at such times, society may perhaps be brought to enough attention for more widespread knowledge and, perhaps, some productive change.",1358198506

Was Aaron a good person? Did he mean well? Certainly. But our relatively brief, pre-Reddit friendship ended years ago because I couldn't take his sometimes relentless negativity something Cory Doctorow hinted at in the obituary he wrote for Aaron. Cory wrote that Aaron's mentors were a support network for each other because it was emotionally hazardous to be on the receiving end of Aaron's disappointment. Aaron was never, ever mean to me, but still the overall bad feeling was a weight I couldn't take. I'm incredibly sad that it appeared to be a weight that he couldn't take, either.<p>It's been my experience that a lot of ""bright"" people are angry that the world, and the people they know, don't ""live up"" to their ""in a perfect world,"" clean-room expectations. Instead of using that as fuel for empathy and character-building, they use it as a weapon and turn it outwards to attack others, or inside to stoke their own misery. Sometimes this drives them to try to achieve more and more and more to shut up the desperate voice inside, but this never works. Maybe they achieve, but achievements don't make them feel better.<p>This makes the whole situation sadder because everyone expects a person with achievements to be happy.<p>Unfortunately, sad truths about how a person contributes to his/her own troubles and miseries, aren't considered kosher or polite to mention in the wake of a tragedy.

5056657,comment,5056089,5056332,1,0,pseingatl,,,"1. Generally speaking, district court criminal cases are non-precedential; i.e., they are not binding on other courts. Sometimes a district court will decide a legal issue that is adopted by a higher court and then becomes precedential. But the more I think about this case, the more it seems to be a political case, and in political cases, the rules are different. In this case, if the Internet reporting is correct, Swartz was only given the option to plead open to the indictment. That is extraordinary. Usually in a non-political case the prosecutor will agree to dismiss most of the counts in exchange for a guilty plea; would recommend a cap or prospective sentence, agree on the amount of the fine, agree not to allocute, etc. Someone wanted Swartz' head on a pike, perhaps for the PACER episode.\n2. Yes. Upon the death of the defendant, the case is over. With all respect to Ms. Ortiz, Rule 48(a) of the Federal Rules of Crim. Proc. shouldn't apply in this case. That rule relates to the dismissal of charges before trial. Upon the death of the defendant, the case cannot proceed to trial as there is no longer a case or controversy; there is only one name on the side of the v. and there needs to be a name on each side. This is a simplification, and it may well be a practice in the District of Massachusetts, but it is not the correct procedure (though I may be hypertechnical here). The point is that it wasn't government benevolence that caused them to file, the case was over upon the death of the sole criminal defendant. If there was another party involved, the case can and would proceed, absent a plea.",1358197466

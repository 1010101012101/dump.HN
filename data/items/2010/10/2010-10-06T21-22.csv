Journalists are happy to have a place-to-work-not-print because they've been watching print die a slow death for years.  They want to work with other journalists, of course, but a roomful of journalists alone isn't an especially profitable company.

Typically, local business has an interest in the proliferation of said local content, so along comes the (local) sales team.  Can the math work?

This makes it very achievable for one guy to tackle as a hobby project.  (It eventually got to the point where full-time employment was my poor paying quirky hobby project.)<p>b) The business, as distinct from the application, works because over the course of four years I became very good at organic SEO and metrics-based optimization.  These are broadly applicable skills in software (and marketing generally).  Surprisingly few people can do them well.<p>c) No, I do not see myself being the bingo guy for forever.  If you wanted to address a similarly small niche yourself, I would say it is a wonderful learning opportunity and has been lifechanging for me.  I wouldn't recommend starting with bingo cards for elementary schoolteachers, because if you are capable of beating me at it your skillset is worth a heck of a lot more money than can ever be extracted from that market for that problem, but virtually any developer can find something similar and learn enough to make it work.  The amount you learn from having your own experimental laboratory is better than grad school, and you get paid to study.  I wouldn't particularly recommend that route if you take money from investors.  Two models, vastly different lifestyles, pick your favorite.",1286401911

You can configure to default 'accept', 'deny' or 'hold until confirmation'. If you default to accept and you do nothing the deal is on. If you default to 'deny' then the deal is off, unless you decide to accept anyway through the link on your wall. If you default to 'hold until confirmation' then you will only be able to proceed after the terms and conditions of this particular deal have been made clear to you and accepted by you through an extra confirmation step.<p>Our advantage in all this is that we hope you will visit facebook more frequently to check up on us.<p>Of course we hope that you will trust us with your data, but given our recent antics we fully understand if you want to put us 'on probation'.<p>As for the why part, we've decided that we'd rather make a bit less money in the sort term and be around in the long term as opposed to chasing you away or giving a competitor enough air-supply to make our lives miserable.<p>We sincerely apologize for our past behavior.<p>As another token of our newly found conscience we will create a board of 10,000 randomly selected users that get to vote on changes that will affect privacy in a negative way, the advice of this board will be binding on us.

It can be a detriment to the <i>local</i> market.<p>I frequent a local thrift store (Deseret Industries, run by the LDS church), where I always quickly scan all 6 book shelves.  Every morning (that I've been there that early), there's one dude that rushes his way to the ""new"" book shelves (the ones that were just rolled out of the back and not yet sorted onto the shelves), towing a cart, and he proceeds to monopolize the shelves as he roots through all the books and searches them manually on his phone (which I assume it internet-enabled).<p>I can't help but get a little annoyed by his presence, especially once I figured out what he was doing.  He wasn't reading all those books, of course; he was hoping to make a profit on them.  I, like many others, look for books to, you know, actually <i>read</i>, and I view this man's actions as rude.  Likewise, when I offload a box or two of books to this same store, I am doing so out of a desire to give back to the local community, and it kind of chaps my hide that this asshat with his phone might buy one of my tech-related softbacks for $1 and sell it on Amazon for $5 or more, potentially denying some poor, local kid who may want to better himself by stumbling on that same book I donated.<p>These days, because of this leech at the thrift store, I'm more inclined to simply shred my books (they make good animal bedding and compost well) than take the effort to load them up into the car and donate them.  Sure, that may be viewed as somewhat selfish, but then again, that's exactly how I view that guy who buys all the books to make a quick buck.",1286399292

There are so many things wrong with the way our government runs its financial affairs, not the least of which is maintaining a global military empire, massive entitlement programs, endless foreign aid, staggeringly unfunded liabilities...

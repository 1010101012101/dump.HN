I had this mindset that the people who really want to see great games are the players and the players so hellbent and fed up with crap games that they are willing to go to great lengths to program their imaginations.<p>I was much more on the analysis side of searching for projects that could do things better. I looked high and low for tons of platforms, libraries, and frameworks comparing them and seeing how they implemented the ideas. I came to the conclusion that some of them are pretty decent but almost all of them are rather bulky. And the ones that are not rather bulky in implementation aren't as separable/modular as they should be.<p>In my opinion it's not necessarily an ADHD thing as it is an creativity with games thing versus the constraining realities of programming (for corporations or not). I don't think I have ADHD I just tend to obsess over certain things for certain periods of time. In fact I like the way I am because I have an undying determination when I am focused on certain things that I do have some control over.<p>I still like reading programming concepts a lot, just not so much into spending hours upon hours rebuilding everything. Many companies just want something that will work. This is irritating to me as it is to many people, but it's the reality of the situation.<p>If your still hell bent on releasing some games my suggestion is to open source good parts of the tools you are developing if you haven't already and ask for support from people who really want to make games. I will definitely consider joining in on working on some projects for free if it means that better games are developed.",1360571275

It doesn't matter that you started very lucky by winning 10 games in a row, because if you play an infinite number of times, you will balance this by loosing 10 games in a row (you'll do it an infinite number of times).<p>In real life people usually don't play an infinite number of times, but the more you play, the better the theory approximates your final outcome. After very large number of games, you will very likely encounter a bad luck series.<p>This is a bit counter intuitive, because according to the theory, there is a difference between a person that enters a fair game with 10$ and a person that enters with 1$ and wins 9$ in the first 9 games. The first person is expected to finish with 10$, the second with 1$, even though both have the same amount of money at some point.

This is just one example of the kind of problem you can experience.<p>What the Single Page App frameworks offer is a nicer way to <i>organize</i> all this complexity. You have models, which can fire events. You have Controllers, which (though defined differently in each framework) help you capture and express event listeners in one well-managed location.

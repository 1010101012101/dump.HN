There are others.<p>The real question is ""Do you need a corporation?"" There are other entity types. This question has legal and tax implications.<p>Then the next real question - if three grand is real money (and in my world three grand buys a lot of food!) have you considered the time and financial cost of ownership of your corporation?  For a one person corporation figure $3k per year minimum. I am such a corporation (in a figure of speech) and imagine getting a $4k bill for a tax return from your CPA. Anyway, you get the point. It ain't the cost of the obstetrician to deliver your baby. It is the care and feeding when you get home.<p>Finally. You are starting a business.

There will never be a right moment. I recommend you evaluate whether you're happy with your current situation, and if not, then seek to change it. Your choice isn't simply between keeping the job and quitting it; perhaps you can find a different way.<p>I was in a similar situation as you are; running a small programming team at age 27, with no real commitments. I decided to stay because the opportunity seemed too good to pass up, but I'll never know where I'd be now if I took a risk back then. Over those three years it seemed like everyone I interviewed ran their own project. Many popped back and forth between working as part of a team, and running teams several times in their career, so it's not as special an accomplishment as I'd thought at the time.

There is no message passing between vertices during the superstep but the vertices will recieve their messages in the next cycle only.<p>There are no remote reads, or shared memory concepts like  locks, mutexes and semaphores - it is a ""pure message passing model"".<p>Vertex can modify its state, or that of its outgoing edges, receive messages sent to it in the previous superstep, send messages to other vertices (to be received in the next superstep) or even change the topology of the graph.<p>Vertex state machine has two states Active/Inactive. a vertex is activated by a message received from a previous superstep.

That's the idea of a working ref system...<p>> Current rules require the player to leave the pitch for treatment. IMO this is a much more streamlined solution. If you change that for the same initial stoppage, plus the ref requesting a review, plus a restart of the game (which may take additional seconds to sort out) it starts to add up. I fail to see how a TV replay shortens that at all.<p>It's not like it all has to happen in sequence. You have a crew of 20 people continuously reviewing the slow motion capture and they tell the results to the ref, who only after that decides what to do. The only difference is that instead of using the ref's eyes, you use super-eyes. A little bit slower but not significantly slower, and significantly more accurate.<p>> How do you define that though? Throwing themselves on the floor with no contact is, obviously, bad and should be punished. But if contact is made how do you judge whether an injury has occurred or not? It's next to impossible a decision to make. On many occasions players make the most out of it - on others the most innocent of taps can be excruciating (this is speaking as an ex-footballer in my youth :D).<p>Are you claiming that a ref in the field can judge this better than one looking at a slow motion video?<p>On TV it's often very obvious that they are faking it. But of course judging this is hard sometimes, the point is that it is way, way harder for a ref on the field to judge than for somebody looking at slow motion video.<p>> To me TV replay represents classic over-engineering of a problem.<p>It's fixing an obviously broken system.",1277211847

2862933,comment,2860508,2861460,1,0,kragen,,,"Yes, you're right.  I was wrong.  Thanks for explaining.  My calculations are below.  Hopefully you have enlightened me; please let me know if I'm still confused.<p>4awg wire is  per thousand feet (6dB of resistance below 10AWG), or 0.005 for 20 feet.  20 amps  0.005 = 0.1 volts.  So the voltage drop is 0.1 volts, which is 0.8% of 12V or 0.08% of 120V.  If it's 20 feet each way, it's 1.7% or 0.17%.<p>The low-voltage gets you double: you need more amps to carry the same power (which is what I thought you were saying) and you <i>also</i> need thicker wire to carry the same current.<p>So, to take a worst-case example, if you have a 900W microwave oven that can tolerate a power supply 10% lower than nominal, and you're running it on 120V 20 feet from the breaker box, you can deal with 6 volts of drop on each side of the romex, at which point you need 900/(120.9) = 8A.  6V/8A = 0.72, which means your wire can have up to 36 per thousand feet, which would be 25AWG, which is about half a millimeter across and commonly used for Ethernet.  Not safe, because you're dissipating more than a watt per foot, which might set something on fire, but the microwave will still run.  (For safety you'd probably use 12AWG instead, which is 2mm across, if not 10AWG.)<p>If instead you're running a different 900W microwave off 12V, you need 900W/(12V0.9), which is 83 amps.  But you can't afford more than 0.6V drop on either side of the rails, and 0.6V/83A = 7.2m, so you can't afford more than 0.36 per thousand feet, which is 5AWG, which is a copper <i>bar</i> 4.6mm in diameter, thicker than any wire in a normal person's house.  Again, that's not to be safe  that's to get the microwave to work at all.  You're still dissipating over a watt per foot of cable.  To be safe, you need 2AWG, which is 6.5mm in diameter, and a pain in the ass to bend if you don't get stranded wire.  20 feet of copper 2AWG triple-stranded wire costs US$150, which is more than the microwave, and weighs 15 pounds.",1312864942

Wall Street is a platform. Its a platform to be exploited by every technological and intellectual means possible.<p>Just because the day to day work of traders on Wall Street has been abstracted away from it's original intention doesn't mean that it doesn't continue to serve that function.  When working in any large system, your focus can be absorbed by whatever smaller task you are working on, and you can loose sight of what your piece of the puzzle does.  When working on a software team of many hundreds of developers, it's easily possible that the code you are working on is not at all specific to the problem you're solving.  That doesn't mean that your work isn't helping to solve the problem.<p>The financial system is very complex, and I won't pretend to have the expertise or knowledge to explicitly explain the service that high frequency traders, for example, are providing.  The way Wall Street currently operates might not be the most efficient system for allocating capital.

The occupants of Libland stay alive by eating Food.  Xia is another state.  For whatever reason, they don't like Libland, and for whatever reason, they can produce Food much more cheaply than Libland.<p>Xia starts flooding the Libland market with cheap Food, so that it's is uneconomic for anyone in Libland to produce Food, and the Food industry disappears.<p>Suddenly Xia cuts of Libland's food supply, and invades several days later.  Libland has no means of producing food in short order, and they cannot buy it from anyone else for some reason (for example Xia is the only other state, or it would take too long to open trading routes with other states).<p>How does Libertarianism cope with this situation?<p>[edit: please don't treat me as stupid or a troll.  I genuinely want to understand libertarianism, and extreme counter-examples are a method of understanding that I find very helpful]",1231675192

Also, people here might provide some input about whether the odds of getting funding really are 90-95% for your type of startup.<p>I strongly recommend spending part of your time (one or two days a week) looking for a job to hedge your bets.",1231674818

I read PG's ""Hackers and Painters"" recently and I think he already answered this question with his analogy with regard to renaissance painters - and personally I think he (Paul) is right.<p>Take a step back from tech and lets talk about movies for a second. Arguably the centers for film-making in the world is LA/Hollywood and more recently India (bollywood).<p>That's about it, many countries produce films, but they're not as prevalent as those 2.",1231674693
429077,comment,428594,428594,0,0,oakmac,,,"Aside from the obvious advice to keep your expenses as low as possible, I think you might consider a change in attitude.  You are playing a game with a positive expected value, but the rules of the game are such that payoffs are very large and very rare (if you've read The Black Swan, think Extremistan).  Unfortunately, the game of ""paying my rent check"" and ""eating on a daily basis"" follows a different set of rules.  You've been allowed the privilege of taking a risk due to your savings; once they are gone you will be playing a different game.  When that time comes you may just decide that ""some business guy's lame vision"" is a decent alternative to being hungry on the streets coding Haskell.  The choice is up to you.<p>Also, stop feeling scared and terrified (your words).  These emotions are not helping you in any way.",1231673795

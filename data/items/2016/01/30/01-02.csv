Fortunately we had watched the “How to Start a Startup” series, so we knew in advance how to concisely introduce our company and also set an appropriate goal for the meeting. Every second counts in a 20 minute meeting with a YC-partner.<p>In under 1 minute we defined the product, market size, and traction to date.<p>In under 1 minute we introduced the team. It takes discipline to not promote your past successes and the degrees you earned. Instead we just stated all the founders are highly technical with a good sense for design, and we have known each other for years.<p>We then simply proposed 3 or 4 opportunities and then kept quiet.  Our target talk-to-listen ratio was 1:5. We kept the single minded goal to obtain advice on strategy and direction.<p>At the very least this series is a kernel that should eventually produce your company’s unique culture. I hope it resonates with you as it did with our team.<p>Thanks YC!",1454119082

Do we actually lose perception as it is ostensibly feels, or do we just lose those memories? I had general anaesthesia a few years, and it left me with a vivid memory of watching part of the surgery. Obviously, it isn&#x27;t a real memory (for a variety of reasons: not possible; wrong surgeon working on the wrong hand; I was &quot;stood&quot; about 30 metres away and the room isn&#x27;t that large etc.), but it definitely feels different to recalling a &quot;normal&quot; dream, and makes me wonder if the anaesthetic induces hallucinations or lucid-like dreams.",1454118972

11000112,comment,10989210,10999365,0,0,jraines,,,"When I reflect on the ease of use question, I realize most of my frustrations with the Clojure REPL have actually been with trying to use it within an editor (Vim, Emacs, and Atom so far).  And particularly with getting a ClojureScript REPL through those tools.  That&#x27;s not something I try to do with Pry, being content to use it from the terminal, so maybe not a totally fair comparison.<p>The app environment thing is mostly about having to switch between a lot of namespaces and/or to make sure they&#x27;re all loaded upon starting the REPL. With Rails+Pry, you can work with any class in your app immediately.  It also lets you put breakpoints in your code, where executing the code in a running process throws you into a REPL at that point, with all the local context up to that point of execution. Also, if you make code changes, you simply type &quot;reload!&quot; in the REPL and everything&#x27;s up to date.  I have a bookmark to read Stuart Sierra&#x27;s post about his workflow to try to get a grip on how to come close to something like that in Clojure.<p>And it can do a lot more great stuff, too:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hfMUP5iTq8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hfMUP5iTq8</a><p>Oh and by the way -- thanks for all of your OSS work in the Clojure world!

Of course hiring a 10x engineer is not <i>sufficient</i> to Solve The Customer&#x27;s Problem. 10x engineers are not fairy dust. However, hiring a 10x is necessary if your customer genuinely needs a bespoke solution, or if you are trying to disrupt an existing tech market.<p>I would also add that one of the main contributions of a 10x is that they raise the productivity of everyone else (creating tools, providing guidance, simplifying code, etc.).

There is no need to make this kind of system so fragile.<p>What happened to using the right tool for each job? The obsession with making everything look like a file that lives under the same global file system hierarchy causes endless problems, and it&#x27;s never been entirely clear to me what benefits it&#x27;s supposed to offer in return. It&#x27;s interesting that Poettering remarked on exposing /dev/sda as root as well, because it&#x27;s another excellent example of how broken this model is.<p>What happened to minimising trust? Of course it&#x27;s crazy that any hardware/firmware actually allows itself to be permanently broken by a software error like this, but the software should not assume the hardware/firmware will take responsibility for providing any necessary safeguards.<p>Ultimately, this is just bad engineering and bad UI.

The human brain is the phenotype of both genes and memes (hence &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;nurture&quot;) and so it is entirely plausible that they could compete with each other over this resource, and that this competition could result in a species split.  Whether the split between conservative and liberal is a reflection of this or not is speculative, of course, but it&#x27;s also testable.

If you&#x27;re a small business, and you&#x27;re buying let&#x27;s say some of the big name CAD software, you&#x27;re <i>easily</i> into 4 figures per seat. You&#x27;re also so small that a lot of the companies making that software won&#x27;t even talk to you directly; you get to buy via a reseller or not at all.<p>That reseller will offer you the standard licensing terms or you&#x27;re welcome to shop elsewhere. You can ask about support, and if you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll get an answer that is somewhat related to your original question, but I have never seen more than platitudes in response to even direct, explicit questions about some of the issues we&#x27;re talking about. Any requests for actual support are also just directed to the reseller if you do manage to make contact with the actual developers, and you&#x27;ll be subject to some of the strictest licence control and activation procedures in the industry.<p>You aren&#x27;t going to be individually negotiating your licensing and support terms with the developers. The developers aren&#x27;t even going to talk to you at any point in the proceedings. And pretty much everyone making software in this league works the same way, so your &quot;terrible decision&quot; is to buy the software you need to do your job, as opposed to your only other choice, which is not to use software to do your job at all.<p>A concrete example, perhaps familiar to more people: Adobe&#x27;s Creative Suite had some pretty aggressive activation technology built into it in later versions before they went to Creative Cloud, and unsurprisingly quite a few businesses haven&#x27;t migrated to their new rental model. If you have a permanent licence with, say, CS5, you&#x27;re still as entitled to use it as you always were, and you can also use Adobe&#x27;s tools to deactivate it on one PC and reactivate it afterwards if you need to reinstall your OS or upgrade to new hardware. But there are two stings in the tail: firstly, any new installation requires access to those servers to activate, and secondly, the initial releases were very buggy and some updates are needed to stabilise them.<p>As of today, to the best of my knowledge, the activation server still works for installation, as long as Adobe&#x27;s people haven&#x27;t got wildly inaccurate information in their database, which from personal experience can certainly happen. However, once you&#x27;ve installed you get prompted to update but then told the updates aren&#x27;t available when you try to do so. The update installation tool is, apparently, no longer supported. Of course, if you&#x27;d like to trade in your otherwise perfectly useful software, they&#x27;ll be happy to have you on their new locked-in, rental plan instead. <i>This</i> is the kind of artificial nerfing I&#x27;m talking about.<p>As a final point, just to be clear: I am <i>not</i> advocating for permanent, free of charge support under all circumstances. We haven&#x27;t figured out how to reliably build software with no bugs yet, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to aim for that. However, in most fields, if you pay a significant amount of money for something, you are legally entitled to get what you paid for or to receive compensations. The software industry collectively takes a lot of liberties with providing something that isn&#x27;t even close to what the customer was actually paying for, and often tries to weasel out of meeting the same obligations anyone else would have to in terms of quality and fitness for purpose via legalese and funny licensing agreements, all the while making billions in revenues from customers who are getting substandard products. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to question whether the current balance of power is appropriate or whether some software developers could do a considerably better job of providing working software that does what their customers are paying for.",1454115849

I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents. That is almost a day&#x27;s wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare, and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether.<p>&#x27;Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts &quot;All aboard!&quot; when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are run over- and it will be called, and will be, &quot;A melancholy accident.&quot; No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of one&#x27;s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it reminds me of the Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. &quot;What!&quot; exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land, &quot;is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?&quot; Yes, I answer, comparatively good, that is, you might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.&#x27;<p>Probably my favorite passage from Walden...",1454115828

I personally have never worked in a company with much process, so i haven&#x27;t experienced that kind of hell. But do keep in mind, there&#x27;s also another kind of hell: Where everybody is a cowboy coder and walks all over anybody&#x27;s changes; where everybody codes 9-5 and then doesn&#x27;t think about code ever, never improves, coding the same as when they started, 15 years after they start.<p>I&#x27;ve found my enjoyment in taking such companies and teaching them how to produce quality code without compromising on speed. I&#x27;ve found my enjoyment in encouraging such companies to take on young coders who i can then teach, and see flower into excellence they could otherwise only reach with years of investment.<p>And occasionally there is the one or two projects that are just for fun, or really touch many many customers.<p>Don&#x27;t give up and blame the world. Look harder. Maybe even change your language. I mainly do Perl, which gets a bit of a bad rap by people who don&#x27;t use it. But compared to companies doing e.g. Java or PHP i find a marked difference in culture. Maybe you&#x27;re just stuck with the wrong focus in your skill set?<p>Or, if you feel brave: Maybe your problem is that you keep getting into the kind of company that wants an employee. Maybe you can change your situation by becoming a freelancer. Keep in mind that as a freelancer, you eventually, if you&#x27;re good enough, end up in the position where you may fire clients. You also tend to see a lot more projects of much more variety.",1454115603

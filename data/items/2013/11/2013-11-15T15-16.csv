Just as we cannot imagine advancements that have not yet come, and are led to believe we are doomed to starvation by our current mental constraints. Acting politically on this belief is incredibly dangerous and has contributed to many human atrocities over the years, including the Jewish holocaust, English subjugation and starvation of Irish potato farmers, China&#x27;s misguided one child policy, and many more.<p>Be careful of this mental trap.

     52% of women caregivers with incomes at or below of the national median of $35k spend 20+ hours each week providing care. The largest racial demographics in this group are black and hispanic2.
    
    Women perform more unpaid labor (most visible in domestics and child care) than men. On childcare alone, mothers spend more than twice as much time per day as fathers do.  On average, working fathers spend only 10min more per day on child care when they are not working, whereas working mothers spend nearly twice as much when not working3.

    Due to additional pay inequity contributing to less access to paid childcare, women of color perform far more child care than white women.

    Those with medical conditions requiring that they regularly visit medical facilities or perform other health-related activities such as getting additional sleep, regularly exercising, doing physical therapy, being away from backlit screens, not sitting in a chair for an extended period of time, resting their hands, etc are all affected by what becomes an extended workday.

    Those with a longer commute have less free time. Those who make less money can&#x27;t afford the same housing costs as those that make more and are able to live in a city, so they are negatively impacted here again.

    Women earn 76-89% of men&#x27;s wages. 6

    Women of color earn as little as 55% of white men&#x27;s wages. 7

I know many women that either don&#x27;t contribute to OSS because they&#x27;ve been dismissed for being women - being too pretty, not pretty enough, being forced to prove their competence more than their male counterparts because they&#x27;re women. I&#x27;ve talked to women who use gender-ambiguous github names and don&#x27;t post a picture of themselves as their avatar because of how quickly this happens. In addition, the sexual harassment, slurs, and other derogatory language that are used directly or indirectly at these groups of people causes many to not want to participate at all.<p>Additionally, there are very public instances of assuming someone is male. with a link to this hacker news post - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6712954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6712954</a><p>Some research about how women get 25 times more harassing messages then men:<p><a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4243412_Assessing_the_Attack_Threat_due_to_IRC_Channels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4243412_Assessing_th...</a><p>More research about harassment of women online:<p><a href=""http://indiana.edu/~tisj/readers/full-text/15-3%20herring.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indiana.edu/~tisj/readers/full-text/15-3%20herring.pd...</a>",1384531063

6740065,comment,6731823,6731823,1,0,userulluipeste,,,"The recited text:<p><i>The Common Language of Science<p>The first step towards language was to link acoustically or otherwise commutable signs to sense-impressions. Most likely all sociable animals have arrived at this primitive kind of conimunication--at least to a certain degree. A higher development is reached when further signs are introduced and understood which establish relations between those other signs designating sense impression. At this stage it is already possible to report somewhat complex series of impressions; we can say that language has come to existence. If language is to lead at all to understanding, there must be rules concerning the relations between the signs on the one hand and on the other hand there must be a stable correspondence between signs and impressions. In their childhood individuals connected by the same language grasp these rules and relations mainly by intuition. When man becomes conscious of the rules concerning the relations between signs the so-called grammar of language is established.<p>In an early stage the words may correspond directly to impressions. At a later stage this direct connection is lost insofar as some words convey relations to perceptions only if used in connection with other words (for instance such words as: &quot;is&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;). Then word-groups rather than single words refer to perceptions. When language becomes thus partially independent from the background of impressions a greater inner coherence is gained.
Only at this further development where frequent use is made of so-called abstract concepts, language becomes an instrument of reasoning in the true sense of the word. But it is also this development which turns language into a dangerous source of error and deception. Everything depends on the degree to which words and word-combinations correspond to the world of impression.<p>What is it that brings about such an intimate connection between language and thinking? Is there no thinking without the use of language, namely in concepts and concept-combinations for which words need not necessarily come to mind? Has not everyone of us struggled for words although the connection between &quot;things&quot; was already clear?
We might be inclined to attribute to the act of thinking complete independence from language if the individual formed or were able to form his concepts without the verbal guidance of his environment. Yet most likely the mental shape of an individual growing up under such conditions, would be very poor. Thus we may conclude that the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language. This makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality. In this sense thinking and language are linked together.<p>What distinguishes the language of science from language as we ordinarily understand the word? How is it that scientific language is international? What science strives for is an utmost preciseness and clarity of concepts as regards their mutual relation and their correspondence to sensory data. As an illustration let us take the language of Euclidean geometry and algebra. They manipulate with a small number of independently introduced concepts, respectively symbols, such as the integral number, the straight line, the point, as well as with signs which designate the fundamental operations, that is the connections between those fundamental concepts. This is the basis for the construction, respectively definition of all other statements and concepts. The connection between concepts and statements on the one hand and the sensory data on the other hand is established through acts of counting and measuring whose performance is sufficiently well determined.<p>The super-national character of scientific concepts and scientific language is due to the fact that they have been set up by the best brains of all countries and all times. In solitude and yet in cooperative effort as regards the final effect they created the spiritual tools for the technical revolutions which have transformed the life of mankind in the last centuries. Their system of concepts have served as a guide in the bewildering chaos of perceptions so that we learned to grasp general truths from particular observations.<p>What hopes and fears does the scientific method imply for mankind? I do not think that this is the right way to put the question. Whatever this tool in the hand of man will produce depends entirely on the nature of the goals alive in this mankind. Once these goals exist, the scientific method furnishes means to realize them. Yet it cannot furnish the very goals. The scientific method itself would not have led anywhere, it would not even have been born without a passionate striving for clear understanding.<p>Perfection of means and confusion of goals seem--in my opinion-to characterize our age. If we desire sincerely and passionately the safety, the welfare and the free development of the talents of all men, we shall not be in want of the means to approach such a state. Even if only a small part of mankind strives for such goals, their superiority will prove itself in the long run.</i>",1384530764

I concluded something a little different.<p>I concluded it biases to: folks who most have the free time and the mindset and the kind of <i>desperateness</i> to be doing it. Or income-increasing ambition. (Like the kind that&#x27;s strongest when you&#x27;re unemployed or under-employed.) Therefore, it biases (again, only statistically) to young males around college or high school age. Most likely living in their parent&#x27;s house, or in a dorm, or perhaps out in their own place but without a spouse, kids, sick family members, or any significant hobbies other than computers. And without a long established work history &quot;out in the real world&quot; and thus lots of fellow coworkers/clients/managers to help keep them fully employed out in that pesky meatspace. And I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing necessarily. Or that this pattern is universal and without exception. I&#x27;m just saying this is the pattern I see in the majority of cases. I didn&#x27;t sense any inherent pro-white bias, or something pro-male. With avatar icons and code commits and pull requests the Internet truly doesn&#x27;t know or care whether you&#x27;re a dog. (Only whether you&#x27;re a smart enough dog that can interact and deliver.) It was just pro-... a certain set of qualities. If a certain demographic is more likely to have those qualities, then, that demographic will be disproportionately present and active there on GitHub. It&#x27;s not a conspiracy, just the physics and economics of it.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing necessarily wrong with it. But it&#x27;s important to realize it&#x27;s at play. And to neither blindly assume that anyone without a GitHub presence, or an active one, or large one, is somehow incompetent/unqualified at software engineering. Or that everybody active on GitHub is a young white male in their parent&#x27;s basement. Instead, treat each person as an individual. And realize that the entire world hasn&#x27;t fully converted over to your wonderful new &quot;rule of thumb&quot; about hiring. Yet. And perhaps never will.

It motivated me to sign up for natural language processing at Coursera, another really fun class.  The start of the NLP class was delayed, during which time I ended up taking Sebastian&#x27;s robotic car class, so I&#x27;m somewhat familiar by now with his style and personality.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s my perspective as a largely self-taught professional, but I always saw Udacity, Coursera, and others simply as continuing education.  It was a little strange to see all of the coverage they&#x27;ve gotten as disruptive, threatening to upend higher education.  Sebastian fed into this when he gave up tenure at Stanford.  He&#x27;s a type-A personality, a rock star.  He can make you an expert in Bayesian probability in one week, write a particle filter &quot;in just five lines of C code!&quot;, and truly believes that &quot;now you too can program a robotic car!&quot;<p>The magic of Udacity was that it bridged the gap between self study and filling a seat in a classroom.  Besides the skillfully edited videos, there was value in the grades and the deadlines (in part because it kept the discussion forums in sync), and I think it was a mistake to make all of the classes self paced.  Peter said in an interview, &quot;In our online class, we give deadlines.  Because if you can watch a lecture online anytime, you can watch it ... tomorrow.&quot;  The paid enrollment is partly about making money, of course, but it&#x27;s also about restoring a bit of the external motivation that grades and deadlines used to provide.",1384529619

A potentially positive indicator, that among many others (including a CV itself) will be part of the body of work to determine a candidate&#x27;s qualifications.<p>Those in hiring positions need to use various indicators of what would make someone a good hire.  For most of history in the tech world, this simply meant a standard resume/CV, followed by a phone screen and then an interview where the candidate may be asked whatever questions are deemed relevant by the interviewer.  Could be tests, exercises, etc - depends on who you were talking to.<p>Fast forward to today, where we have more ways that a candidate may show &#x27;indicators&#x27; of talent.  What about participation in user groups and meetups?  Anyone can go to these things, but people who choose to go to them may have a bit more curiosity or interest (and admittedly free time) than those that don&#x27;t, and that curiosity often goes hand in hand with talent.  Not always, but again it is one indicator.<p>A healthy Stack Overflow reputation score might be another indicator.  People who know nothing about programming probably won&#x27;t be able to rake up major points there.<p>What if someone wrote a book about a technology?  Another indicator probably, and if the book became a best-seller that would be even a stronger indicator since others are judging the material as worthy of their money.<p>As the author points out, all of these things take time, and many in the industry don&#x27;t have that kind of free time.  Understood.<p>Experience working at a known entity with a high barrier to entry is another indicator.  We know that if someone passed the grueling interview process at certain firms, chances are they will get past our process as well.  Another positive indicator.<p>There will also be some false positives.

The fact that I did not have a degree was likely one of the biggest items that gave her and her family pause prior to us getting married. Part of it&#x27;s cultural and part of it tied to the fact that her father was a College Physics Professor in a land that didn&#x27;t have many such positions. So my interest in investigating this grew out of that, my wife&#x27;s desire that I, at some point, get a degree.<p>Personally, the draw for further education where the overriding aim is either a degree or prestige, has never really been a motivator.for myself. I attended two years at the University of Utah and, while I very much enjoyed the resources for learning that a University offers, there was little else to compel me to obtain a terminal degree.<p>To my point on Minerva, why would someone of note, interested in novel and everything about the world that&#x27;s disrupting the old model, why would an exceptional and genuinely mold breaking person like that have a desire to create a new prestige centric institution? Why create IVY 2.0? Why try and create a degree on par with the elite when the whole purpose of modern learning and tech culture is that it&#x27;s what you know and can do than what kind of rubber stamp you can obtain?<p>I read their application and wonder &#x27;Who of those really seeking a new order are going to really swallow some modern iteration of the same worn out concept of an elite rubber stamp setting you above  everyone else principally due to your being able to win at whatever rigmarole they have, in an a way that is a priori arbitrary, set up?<p>I&#x27;d much rather the validation of market forces and natural selection as a stamp of the value of my past doings than I would like any, even if well intentioned, modern rendition of the old mortarboard and folded document.",1384528230

<i>very</i> serious, fully, 100%, iron
clad, totally serious.  It&#x27;s one
of the most important lessons I
had to learn in life, a lesson
I didn&#x27;t know and had to learn, the
hard way, a very, very hard way,
and the cost was high, very high,
a major fraction of my whole life.<p>What I said about babies is a 
slight exaggeration of some recent,
solid research.  It&#x27;s correct.
Nearly every parent with anything like
an open mind and both boy and girl
children comes to the same conclusion,
finds that such differences between
boys and girls are so totally obvious
that no one should fail to understand
them.<p>The girls like dolls, and the boys
like fire trucks.  And this usually
holds even if the boys and girls are
treated just the same.  Why?  Early
in the crib, the girls are interested
in emotional connections with people,
and the boys are interested in things.<p>Tannen describes some more research
on the differences already at age
5.<p>I&#x27;m correct:  What I&#x27;m saying about
nearly all girls and women is
100% absolutely, positively, totally
rock solidly correct.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>You are very, very different.  I&#x27;ve never seen
such a girl.  As I indicated, I&#x27;ve seen
girls who could do technology very, very
well (I was married to one; she
was Valedictorian, <i>Summa Cum Laude</i>,
Phi Beta Kappa, Woodrow Wilson,
NSF, and Ph.D.), but she didn&#x27;t like
it.  The story did not end well.<p>If I had a daughter, then I&#x27;d encourage
her to be a very traditional female,
including thinking about clothes,
hair, and makeup.  But I&#x27;d also 
try to get her well informed on people,
men, relationships, marriage, family,
parenting, emotions, psychology,
socialization, and art.  And for
a career, I&#x27;d suggest something
involving people, maybe being 
a bookkeeper, accountant, CPA,
nurse, K-12 teacher, etc.  No way
would I sacrifice her life trying
to shovel sand against the tide.<p>There&#x27;s a big reason I don&#x27;t have
a daughter or any children or now
even a wife:  I was far too slow
to understand the usually rock
solid differences between boys
and girls.<p>Maybe someday I will write a book
covering what I wish I&#x27;d known --
<i>Girls 101 for Dummies -- Boys</i>.
Could do a lot in 100 pages.<p>If I did have a daughter, then I&#x27;d
conclude that
she needs a good life; for that she
needs a good marriage; and 
a good marriage is based on
&quot;offspring, security, and care taking&quot;,
and extra credit for knowing the
source (hint: it was a woman, and
past President of the American 
Psychiatric Association).<p>Knowing and liking Linux won&#x27;t by
itself keep you from having a good
life as a woman, even an otherwise
quite traditional woman.  Still,
nearly no girl or woman actually
likes technology -- they like
people, not things.",1384528209

Soon after, I saw that a lot of my friends were playing. Girlfriends were getting boyfriends to tend their crops for them while at work. They were very scrupulous with the design of their farm and tending their crops.  But I wanted to just be at the top of the leaderboard.<p>Unlike later games, it was possible to keep leveling up and making money by farming only instead of inviting friends. Plow fields, plant crops, and then harvest them hours later -- repeat as fast and as frequently as you can. TONS of tedious clicking. Of course, I wanted to automate it, and I wasn&#x27;t alone. Searching around, I found a Perl script that someone had written and I adapted it for my PC.<p>I just fired up Farmville, and here&#x27;s what my farm looks like: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/nrtkitJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/nrtkitJ.jpg</a>. It&#x27;s almost all crops (maximize $) and it requires the farmer to be trapped within hay bales. Otherwise, he walks to where you&#x27;re clicking and can sometimes get in the way of the click. It would mess up every now and then, but was fairly reliable -- just run the script and let it do its thing for a few minutes. The trick was to flip the game into full screen mode, zoom all the way out, start at a known (x, y) position on your screen&#x27;s resolution, and then loop through all crop positions by incrementing/decrementing (x, y). Only slightly tricky because of the isometric view and avoiding clicking on some non-crop positions. Picking the right crop was important too, to maximize yield. I just wanted to do two runs a day: first thing in the morning and then in the evening when I got home from work.<p>I moved up fairly quickly and quit when I beat all of my friends. Got some jeers from those who thought I was actually playing Farmville so much, but had a few requests for said script ...",1384528105

Good ones are pretty expensive, and they require periodic servicing for bearings, gaskets (for vacuum sealed systems), etc.  Generally limited to niche applications for now, but there are various pilot projects to look at them for train system energy recovery and grid storage.",1384527811

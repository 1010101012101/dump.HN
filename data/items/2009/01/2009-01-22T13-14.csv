There are many business people like this in the United States today.  It is a little endemic to the type of education we receive in my opinion.<p>Business people here can give you the formula for compound interest off the top of their heads.  And tell you how much money they are making on the cash they have in the bank with impressive detail.  Yet when you get to the part of due diligence where you ask them about amortization issues on their plan to manufacture a new type of widget, the eyes glaze over and you can hear the song and dance in their reply.<p>So even though you know it's not the best thing for the country . . . you recommend that they outsource manufacturing.",1232632654

444735,comment,444461,444710,0,0,moe,,,"Well, that depends on your environment ofcourse, but I'd say when you're spending 90% of your time on forms and reports then you're doing something wrong. A smart programmer would probably find or build a framework that allows the consumers of said reports to build their own so he doesn't have to continiously waste his time on that.<p>That's btw one of the main differences that I see between great and mediocre programmers. When you give the task of ""build a report"" to a mediocre programmer then he'll go and build a report that meets to your specs. He'll keep doing that even if he gets the same task every week.
A great programmer on the other hand will soon start trying to optimize the process by generalizing and automating. That's where the creativity kicks in. Programmers who love to code will try to get a repetitive, monotone duty out of their way asap, in order to free their time for more interesting problems. Programmers who merely ""write code for a living"" will rather stick to such tasks despite their inefficiency, because that ""one hour per day on boring recurring tasks"" is one hour that they don't have to do real work.",1232632452

As I've had the opportunity to come into contact with many amazing people, one thing has struck me about the most successful among the people I have met.<p>The most successful and well-connected people I have met over the last year are, more often than not, the most humble and accessible people I've met. I think this is because of two reasons:<p>The first is that you never really know who someone is based on simple first impressions. And, perhaps more importantly, you never know who someone will become. So, aside from the natural human decency that should accompany all of our relationships,  it's just smart from a business perspective to treat everyone with respect and not write off those who don't necessarily make a strong impression in person. I've met quite a few people here personally responsible for earning  tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and it's not rare for these people to be decidedly non-flashy and almost a little awkward. It would, of course, be a mistake to misjudge these individuals merely on the basis of the first impression they make because they are truly heavy hitters.<p>The other reason is one that is probably more common and it's simply part of the natural humility that comes from building up a business out of nothing. Many of the successful people I know come from modest, decidedly non-elite backgrounds and this gives them the right combination of empathy and ambition that enables them to succeed.<p>Just wanted to share that here in the hopes that it will be useful to the other startup founders here.",1232630129

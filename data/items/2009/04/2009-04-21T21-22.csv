573091,comment,572165,572519,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Funny that.  If you use OO for everything in Smalltalk, often it's pretty.  If you use OO for everything in, say, Perl 5, it feels quite cumbersome to me.  (Ever meet one of those guys who uses one instance of polymorphism in their whole project and talks as if they've mastered OO?)<p>Look inside the Smalltalk image sometime.  There is a clear attempt at OO <i>everywhere</i> for <i>everything</i> and it feels natural and unforced.  (Well, it's about 70%, to be completely accurate, because there's also some functional and some OO newbie code in there.)<p>""proper"" is all about cost/benefit tradeoffs, and it's very context-dependent.  Expressing things polymorphically in an environment like Smalltalk, Python, or Ruby has low coding overhead.<p>Sometimes, it is just better to crank out an old-fashioned procedural routine and be done with it.<p>One of the key tradeoffs: Am I trapped, or will I be able to change my mind?  So long as you can keep yourself from getting trapped, you're mostly safe.",1240350937

I could understand somewhat a point in having an in-browser 3D or 2D game without plugins (Javascript or even Flash and Silverlight which I consider defacto indluded already), I just don't understand why would I want to install a game into the browser, which you do if you install a plugin, and tolerate degraded experience in contrast to standalone installation and have a full blown experience.<p>I DON'T GET IT, what is the motivation?

This forces you to learn how to work with immutability, which I have become a big fan of. When working with C# I try to avoid mutability as much as possible (naturally this is quite a bit uglier than in Haskell, but it does avoid some problems). Most of my C# projects now acquire a Haskell.cs file fairly quickly, containing things like a Tuple class, zip, >>=, etc.<p>In the time I've spent learning it, Haskell has quickly become my favourite language. It's not perfect (my current main wishes are existential types and an extensible record system), but it is considerably less painful than the other languages I know.<p>As for speeding up the transition, I can't offer anything other than just diving in. At some point it will just click and you will wonder what all the commotion is about (another monad tutorial? why?). Granted, I still don't have the slightest idea about why I would want to use a hylomorphism or what to do with a comonad, but perhaps I will some day.

He arranges the power consumption of countries by per person per sq m.  And renewables can sit on same scale, and his estimate for PV solar is about 20% of land mass of Germany needs to be covered.<p>This is one of the many problems of the renewables debate - apples and oranges.  The Germans have done an incredible and positive thing.  Massively upped the feed into the electric grid from solar PV.  And electrical consumption is where nuclear plants feed - so the two methods are direct competitors.<p>But electrical consumption is only about 1/3 of goal energy budget of western countries, rest is evenly split between transport and heating and about 5% for everything else like rocket launches.<p>So 50% of about 30% says that ""Germany has 15% of it's total energy from renewables, will need to increase that by 7fold, give everyone an electric car and heating that uses electricity and not ....<p>Yes it's a great step forward.  But really, we are going to have to change our lifestyles beyond belief to meet even 80% energy use from renewables.

We just do not know which ones would survive.  We do not know which are the ""valid claims"".<p>Everyone also knows that patent litigation is very expensive.\nIt's too expensive to answer the question-- Is this a valid claim?-- for each and every claim in each and every patent asserted against an ""infringer"".<p>And so it follows that by threatening a competitor (""infringer"") with patent litigation, you can bring them to the negotiation stage, quite easily.  They will be willing to make a deal.<p>Litigation puts patent claims under a higher level of scrutiny that the patent office gives them.  For ease of reference, let's call it a ""review"".<p>If we make it inexpensive to do this ""review"", we can ""disarm"" these patents.<p>We won't have to go through the ""review"" process for each and every defensive patent.  Because no one will be willing to negotiate based on threats when the cost to ""call the patent troll's bluff"" is affordable to anyone.<p>Patent litigation (the ""review"") is expensive.  It is prohbitively expensive to separate the wheat from the chaff.  This condition is  a prerequisite for ""patent trolling"" to be a viable ""business"".<p>And it <i>is</i> a viable business.

They've already said they don't really 'care' that they are a public company, and never really wanted to be one.  It was just the easiest way to raise a boatload of money.<p>Now that they ARE public, why should they care about their share price?  They don't plan on selling any more shares to raise money, and there's zero chance of a hostile takeover, even if shares trade down to $1. You think Zuck is worrying about the shareholders before breakfast? Not a chance.<p>Facebook (the corporation) has already sold all the shares it planned to sell, and raised the absolute most money it could have ever hoped to raise for those shares.<p>The low share price will keep employees holding on (and working for FB) waiting for shares to cross that magic $42 point.

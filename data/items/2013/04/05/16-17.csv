To create .exe files you'll need a linker, but it works fine with ld.exe from MinGW.<p>Going assembly straight to .exe sounds convenient for learning, but isn't very useful in practice, so not many assemblers implement it.  The most common use case for assembly language these days is to write a few functions that get called from some higher level language, and that's done by having both the compiler(s) and assembler spit out object files that are linked together by the linker.  I suspect WinASM is just hiding the steps, and it'd be easy enough to create a Makefile that did the same.<p>The closest thing to assembly->exe that I know of is the ""flat"" binary output from Yasm.  It's similar to really old DOS .com executables.  I'm not sure they'll run on modern Windows, though.",1365180807

We're a unique and small (25, soon growing to 50) company focusing on search and optimization. Employees here are treated incredibly well and have a lot of freedom to get the job done, or to create something new and useful.

5499492,comment,5498869,5499389,4,0,the_mitsuhiko,,,"> Flask<p>I don't know about Sinatra or anything else but I can give you the reason why Flask out of the box performs like it does.  Unlike PHP Flask is threadsafe and uses locks and thread or greenlet local storage.  This level of indirection adds a basic performance penalty when executed on a single threaded server like gunicorn.  There are ways to change that if you think that becomes a performance problem by replacing the stack object with one that does not do dispatching and by removing the locks.<p>This in theory is easy to do, it's just generally not a real issue since most Flask apps will actually wait on database more than they waste CPU time.<p>Additionally Flask has a huge request handling overhead which will be primarily noticable in dummy benchmarks that don't do much in view functions.  If you have an application that actually barely executes anything in the views you can subclass the Flask object to remove some of the functionality you normally always pay for (request processors, session initialization, message flashing etc.)<p>Lastly Flask has some sanity checks when Python is not run with `-O` that simplify debugging.  Depending on which code paths you hit you might be paying for some of that.<p>In the database test the primary slowness is most likely not Flask but the way the database is configured.<p>Generally if you ever encounter Flask to be an actual performance problem I am more than happy to point you to ways to get more speed out of it.  Generally speaking though there is not much point micro-optimizing until you notice it is a problem.",1365180291

A longer running view across all of these frameworks would cause things to even out a bit.  All that being said, however, it's not an unfair comparison. After all, a benchmark of this nature should be a measure of overhead because that's really all there is to measure.",1365180287

It seems you acknowledge that if we could magically swap AAVE and ASE completely, such that news anchors talk about how Obama ain't got no sense and young black children go home crying because they were marked down for using ""whom"" as an object, nothing else would change; What you call proper English would be the despised language of the underclass and the well-to-do would look down on them every time they ignorantly used a single negative in a phrase that requires the full construction.<p>And if you do acknowledge this, can you see how the classification of English dialects into ""proper"" and ""improper"" groups, which could more rightly be labeled ""potent"" and ""impotent"", amounts to massive institutionalized racism (for ethnolects) and classism (for sociolects)?<p>Or to put it in more personal terms, could you see yourself recognizing that the privileged in our society will look down on the underprivileged for speaking their native language correctly while simultaneously making some effort to be less of one of those people yourself?<p>> My impression of your viewpoint is that kids should be taught in AAVE and have a separate Standard English class to learn how 'white folks speak'.<p>Is that your impression of how ESL is employed for young native Spanish speakers? It is not. Once or if a person is fluent enough in the second language that the classes designed for native speakers can be productive, they are included in those classes and graded accordingly (perhaps with auxiliary tutoring if necessary). What is your argument for forcing them into those classes before that point, or without that auxiliary tutoring?<p>> 1) Standard English is not a dialect. That's just a matter of definition.<p>Whose definition are you using? This is the first line from Wikipedia: ""Standard English (often shortened to S.E. within linguistic circles) refers to whatever form of the English language is accepted as a national norm in an Anglophone country."" That is, by definition, a dialect. (Or, generically, a group of dialects.) Accordingly:<p>> 2) I'd also say that 100% of formal English speech and writing is using it.<p>And yet British news is written in British English and Australian news in Australian English and so on. The differences between these Englishes are relatively minor, apparently so minor that you do not consider them distinct dialects -- and perhaps that's my fault for not using the more PC term ""variety"" -- but they assuredly are.<p>Or do you mean to say that, since ""standard"" refers to the dialect used in formal speech in a country, the language of formal speech is by definition ""standard""?

So, while bitcoin might have similar utility to gold on the assumption that major world currencies are largely, themselves, stable, its not better than gold as an insurance against those systems collapsing.<p>Now, personally, I think that hoarding any type of alternative currencies against major collapse (rather than keeping reserves of simple useful survival items) is foolish, many of the arguments for both gold and bitcoin are premised around a supposedly-inevitable collapse of traditional major sovereign currencies (and, particularly, the US dollar.) And, while I think neither gold not BTC is a good choice to protect against that kind of contingency, I think its pretty clear that BTC is far <i>worse</i> than gold in that role.",1365177922

P2P and social networking were made for each other -- it should be a lot more efficient to peer with your actual social circle rather than a group of strangers, since the data you're most interested in is more likely to already exist somewhere within your own social circle.<p>Imagine a simple Twitter-like system built on top of this, for example. Each web client would function as a store-and-forward. Every time you connect with a friend, both parties would reconcile the latest posts from all friends that they share in common. In this way, information on social networks could be disseminated rapidly and efficiently with no centralisation whatsoever.<p>Seems to me like just two other bits of technology would be needed for this: ubiquitous dual-key authentication, and a good UID system. I don't think either of those would be a problem, and I really hope somebody does this, since centralised social networks bother me more than a little bit.",1365177877

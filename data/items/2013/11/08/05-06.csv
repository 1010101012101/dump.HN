Album sales are a lost cause. If Spotify disappeared, the situation for musicians would not change. Right now, Spotify makes a convenient scapegoat because they are popular and don&#x27;t pay much, but they are not the cause of the problem. I&#x27;m sure many people at Spotify want to help musicians get exposure.<p>To put this in perspective, $20 is a ridiculous amount of money compared to traditional record contracts, but after administrative and promotional fees were extracted, the classical record contract could often cost musicians money. The recording industry has been preying on musicians for years, but music fanss have been more than willing to pay their favorite bands for merch or buy expensive concert tickets for a live event. Ticket scalping is booming.<p>There are legitimate revenue streams available to musicians, but pay-per-listen is not going to be profitable.",1383889597

Feels a bit tasteless to use the book license for this purpose, to me, but then again I&#x27;m a Heinlein fan and I thought Robocop was dumb.<p>One of the big issues in the book is that patriotism isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> a rhetorical trick to get naive young boys to volunteer for a meatgrinder (though of course Verhoeven and Neumeier are right, it does that too).  If no one stands up for a society, then that society is vulnerable to predators.  Sometimes it&#x27;s foreign invasion, sometimes it&#x27;s internal predators like corruption and profiteering.  I think this call to have a little backbone is relevant in every era.  (This position is straightforwardly argued by the mouthpiece character, Dubois.)<p>And another issue, a little less prominent but often-criticized, is the idea of only giving the franchise to those who earn it.  Heinlein later wrote that he wasn&#x27;t so much advocating this particular plan for the franchise, (e.g. forwarding an alternative: only give the franchise to mothers!), but that he felt that democracy was going in a bad direction (bread, circuses, demagoguery, and holy-war-style partisanship), and that maybe this &quot;franchise-for-all&quot; premise should be revisited.<p>Why do I think Verhoeven was spitting in Heinlein&#x27;s face?  I probably shouldn&#x27;t try to paraphrase Heinlein, because he was a complex guy with complex political opinions, but I think he generally favored military strength (though he generally did not favor a strong central government).  I&#x27;m not as familiar with the Verhoeven oeuvre, but seems to be focused against military-industrial complex (though that&#x27;s more straightforwardly a Robocop thing), and his anti-war rhetoric is so un-nuanced (it&#x27;s so slapstick that some people thought it was pro-war) that it&#x27;s tempting to believe he&#x27;s anti-all-war (contrasting with people who think the phrase &quot;just war&quot; is meaningful, a group I feel confident includes Heinlein).  As I said earlier, I think it&#x27;s a bit tasteless to try to make a franchise work into a direct attack on the original.<p>For some contrast: IIRC, Haldeman wrote The Forever War in part as a direct reply to Starship Troopers.  Haldeman had lots of direct combat experience, too (as contrasted with Heinlein, who I think never saw combat), which partially informed his views on books like Heinlein&#x27;s.  Personally, I think The Forever War is too good at raising new issues to be seen entirely as a reply to anything, but I understand that was a motivator.",1383889120

This amazing service is operating at a loss and has been for years now. If artists want better payouts maybe they should lobby their labels to do so.<p>A service like Spotify costs a lot of money in terms of bandwidth and infrastructure to operate. Storing and streaming music isn&#x27;t a trivial thing, the costs of operating the service are a massive percentage of Spotify&#x27;s monthly expenditure fees.

Once it has finished collecting constraints for the all the sub-expressions it attempts to satisfy those constraints.<p>If the constraints can&#x27;t be satisfied there are two problems. First, you have to know where you got the constraint from. This is fairly easy to solve in implementation you can tag the constraints for example. Second, is that the way in which the constraint &quot;fails&quot; or is unsatisfiable doesn&#x27;t always give you enough information.<p>For example:<p>\x -> if x then x else 1<p>Here the constraints basically say that x has type Bool and 1 has type Int. This is obviously wrong because the `if x then x else 1` has to be either Bool or Int. Now the question is, which one is wrong? Is the use of the second x wrong or is the use of the 1 wrong. You can&#x27;t know so you have to report something and this is only a trivial example.<p>[edit]: I said &quot;mostly&quot; but I changed that to be &quot;partly&quot; because type systems like Haskell&#x27;s are very complex and in some cases type inference is undecideable (rank n polymorphism) so that obviously makes reporting an error very hard :)",1383887405

There they are paying $13/kW for peak capacity, $8.58 for off-peak, and $2.99 for &quot;partial peak&quot;, whatever that is.<p>So it sounds like being able to level peaks in your power consumption could be a big win.

Why wouldn't some open source OCR software work, where you feed it your old PDFs and it outputs OCRed PDFs. Is this some kind of tactic for scanner manufacturers to sell newer versions of scanner or am I understanding this wrong. (Maybe OCR happens at the pre-PDF level where the scanner can read the document in a higher resolution?)",1290574695
1936543,comment,363,363,0,0,roryokane,,,"Please delay the disappearance of the upvote arrow until the upvote has been received and acknowledged by the HN server. The up-arrow could stay as-is until the upvote has finished sending, or could be dimmed.<p>Background:<p>When one upvotes a comment or submission, the up-arrow disappears right away, but there is a bit of network lag before the upvote is actually sent to the server. On some networks, this lag can be significant. Lag on my network has caused me to sometimes upvote an item, close the window immediately, come back later, and then realize that the upvote wasn’t counted. This is more of a problem for submissions, where not only does the submitter not get credit, but the submission also fails to get added to my Saved Links page.<p>The only way to check whether an upvote has been received is to refresh the page, but that also has the effect of canceling any upvotes-in-progress that have not finished, and requires one to remember which item you upvoted.<p>My current workaround, after I upvote something, is to leave the tab open, view other pages for a while, and close the tab when I come back to it later. However, this has the disadvantage of me having to remember, when I return to a tab, whether I left it open because there was still something to read on it or simply because I was waiting for an upvote to finish.",1290574578
1936542,comment,1935049,1935980,0,0,partition,,,"I thought group theory was the easy part. Indeed, that's pretty much what crypto is based on. Many other security applications in CS also rely on group-theoretic notions. Consider homomorphic encryption; the idea that one can develop an encryption algorithm that allows an untrusted source to work with your sensitive data without discovering your data itself, due to the fact that there exist 'one-way' functions from plaintext to gibberish that actually preserve certain operations you care about; i.e., if<p>encrypt(x) = x'
encrypt(y) = y'
encrypt(z) = z'<p>and x + y = z,  homomorphic encryption for (+) gives you that x' + y' = z'.<p>Farther away from completely direct applications like these are algebraic ways of viewing a CS problem. Consider vectorizing a for loop that does in-place update of a variable with +=. We know that this can be turned into a parallel reduction, where if N is the length of the list over which the for loop is iterating, the parallel reduction will take O(log N) time. But what other operations does it work with? Associative ones? What can we do if it's not associative, or the return type of the in-place update is different? And so on.<p>That's pretty much the tip of the iceberg when it comes to abstract algebra being used in CS.<p>Now on to category theory. I'm still very, very new to it, but I've been seeing tons of connections anyway. I figure I can view the higher level of abstractness two different ways; that it's going to be hard and impractical to make any connection to anything concrete; or, that excitingly many things admit a categorical view precisely because of how general the theory is.<p>Let's start with the category-theoretic notion of functors; functions taking functions to functions. Never going to see these outside of functional programming, right? You've worked with functors if you've ever spent any significant time in a Unix shell.<p>Here's a nice blog post on the connection:<p><a href=""http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/Higher-order_shell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conway.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/wiki/blog/posts/Higher-ord...</a><p>Indeed, 'sudo' can be seen as a functor, taking commands (handwavingly, morphisms from the set of user-privilege states to itself) to higher-privileged commands. Let's check the  idea with respect to the functor laws. Does sudo <cmd1>; sudo <cmd2> behave the same as sudo cmd3; (where cmd3 is a script that does <cmd1>;<cmd2>). What is sudo sudo cmd? Now think of any Unix command modifier you would care to write. How would it satisfying the functor laws make it an easier command modifier to use?<p>Also important is the notion of initial objects in the context of proving properties about the behavior of any algorithm on any data structure (including an interpreter, on a programming language!). It generalizes the notion of a 'starting object' in the context of a set of objects related to each other by transformations; like the empty list in the set of lists related by concatenation. What's useful about this? Proving things on structures that do come from initial objects admit easy proofs by induction. Moreover, if you can come up with the proper set + transformations, you can come up with very 'useful' initial objects for whatever you're trying to prove.<p>More on that here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects</a>",1290574484

The one case I know of is the word ""gallo"" (Spanish for rooster).  The Gallo wine company has such a strong mark that they regularly crush people that try to use the word in any context, such as a small hispanic artist in San Antonio that named his company ""Puro Gallo"".  I'm not saying I agree with this, at all, but that is one aspect of current trademark law.  It took the Gallo family decades to establish the strength of their mark.  I would guess that the entire idea of ""Facebook"" will be rather quaint long, long before the idea of ""face"" can embed itself into general commerce enough to be protectable as a word in all uses.",1290574427

Start by googling resources about how to bootstrap a startup. $150/week is plenty, although you'll have to save for some bigger purchases.<p>Firstly, you'll should plan on doing most/all the work yourself. This isn't strictly required, but I find it to be the most fun part of the job. Save the money for advertising, PR, link building, domain registration, company formation, accountants, etc.<p>Alternately, you can select a product you you want to build, save for a few months, and then just pay someone to do it for you. There was a good interview on Mixergy about exactly this method, where a $2k investment turned into $80k/month. <a href=""http://mixergy.com/free-apps-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/free-apps-interview/</a> I wouldn't expect to have the same kind of success, but it is something you could pursue.<p>If you are more interested in sitting back and investing in established companies, a lot of people will try to sell you hot stocks or whatever. Don't listen. In the long run (3-5 years) no one, save a very few people like Warren Buffet, beat the market. Roll some percentage of your money into an S&P index, and international index, and a bond index, then re-balance every year. The closer to retirement you are, the more money should become cash or CD's. The younger, typically the more in stock + international. It's boring, but it's the surest way to have your portfolio grow.<p>Personally, I prefer the startup route (but I do plenty of investing as well).<p>Good luck!",1290571557

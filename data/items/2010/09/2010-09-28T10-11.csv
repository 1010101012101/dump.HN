I don't think the user's programs should use the same libraries (or even the same language install) that the distro's programs depend on. This way, if the user messed something up (like trying to upgrade a library), the entire distro wont be hosed. It's a really bad idea from a stability, security, and design standpoint if you don't keep these two things separate.",1285671544

But I think it's very reasonable to ask that if someone (anyone) discovers a bug, then the right thing to do is to report it.  They don't have to <i>fix it</i> themselves; maybe that responsibility falls on the rubygems package maintainer.  But the maintainer will never <i>know</i> there's a bug until someone reports it.<p>Yes, it does seem to be a critical and obvious-to-catch bug.  But as davidw said, maybe the maintainer already had the prereqs installed, maybe they were having a bad day, and they just ran a quick test and saw that it worked and released it.  Mistakes happen, and I'm sure the maintainer would be happy to fix those mistakes, but they can't be fixed if the maintainer doesn't even know about them.<p>On a side note, I agree with Zed's rant on Debian being unique with its configuration and packaging layout.  I use Ubuntu on my work laptop and so I've gotten used to the different filesystem layout for config files, etc.  When it comes time to set up a server, am I going to go with a different distro and remember which distro has which config file in which location, or am I just going to stick with Ubuntu server because I already know it?

I think it is great to do what you love and what you are energized by. Eventually, you may not be so energized by those things and need a pivot, and when you do, follow that as much is as possible, if it is your life calling. Not everyone will have the various riches in life, but if you do what you can to do what you love, you'll be more fulfilled. However, doing what you love must involve doing things for others (a service-filled life). There is a balance here. If you hate your work, you cannot serve others adequately. However, if you are not serving others, you have not found your calling. imo humility, prayer, research, and action are the ways to find the right life.",1285669103

And conservatives opposed this bill strongly, for one reason because it adds layers of bureaucracy between doctors and patients that inflate and hide costs to the consumer. Also it mandates purchase of insurance (surely a benefit to insurance companies) which they strongly opposed.<p>My point is simply, one could easily argue that the Democrats would be the largest opponents of such changes because of the very nature of the affordable care act, and as a libertarian / conservative myself I&#x27;m absolutely for policy that increases direct payment, price transparency and a more open market in health insurance.

My suggestion will give you a big win because of branch prediction optimization. Without it, the CPU pipeline will be processing less instructions in parallel because the condition will be false in most cases.</i><p>Thank you, Captain Obvious, for that very simplified explanation of junior undergrad systems architecture. That would all be very important if branch prediction misses were your biggest problem. Maybe look up the Sieve of Eratosthenes people keep mentioning because hey, people keep mentioning it for a reason!<p>Arguing about branch misses in this algorithm is like arguing about branch misses in a bogosort implementation. The correct optimization isn&#x27;t to remove branch misses, it&#x27;s to <i>stop using bogosort and use a reasonable sorting algorithm</i>.<p>I&#x27;ll charitably believe that you read the article, but if you&#x27;re still complaining that the code is unoptimized when the author <i>clearly said it was unoptimized</i> then you didn&#x27;t understand the article. The article isn&#x27;t about code optimization, it&#x27;s about gathering performance metrics for naively-written code. It&#x27;s profiling the <i>language</i>, not the code.<p>> If you cannot tell me where the bottleneck is (what&#x27;s saturated), then you are better off not doing anything.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you one thing for sure: the bottleneck isn&#x27;t branch prediction misses.<p>EDIT: Just to tack on more reasons you&#x27;re wrong here: 1) You don&#x27;t actually know that what you did removed any possible branch prediction misses without looking at the generated assembly, and 2) you could probably eliminate more branches using a switch-case statement (although again you&#x27;d have to look at the generated assembly to see if that&#x27;s the case).",1436021783

 The idea is that the front-end engineers don&#x27;t have to deal with styles anymore.<p>They can just take a <Tab><Item/><Item/><Item/></Tab> and expect those components to be designed inside of the components themselves.<p>This is var more similar to how iOS handles design.

9830301,comment,9829614,9829614,0,0,ytjohn,,,"I read this and this that it&#x27;s a lot closer to what RSS intends to solve, especially the read-only streams. Two-way streams is mainly providing a method to post back into that feed. It&#x27;s a little more real time (rss feeds are typically cached and refreshed), and a real-time implementation would e more of an collection of entries that are pushed to the server presenting the stream and ultimately to the client.<p>What I think 
With that in mind, I feel this concept is very close to a lot of the p2p or decentralized content distribution systems being tested out these days, like aether[1] or matrix.org[2].<p>The backend implementation that matrix.org uses is rather ideal. It&#x27;s Federated JSON over HTTP(S). The clients out today are heavily focused on chat, but it is data agnostic. You could have client that writes rich media content and a client that displays this as a blog. Going back to the streams concept, you could have a client subscribed to multiple streams (rooms in matrix vernacular) and as people post their messages - rich media or simple &quot;how are you&quot; comments, it would get federated out to each home server, which can present a web client interface like in tonsky&#x27;s mock-ups.<p>For the concept of amazon providing sensitive order information as a stream/matrix room, there would have to be an add-on concept built into the client of some sort of security token. I&#x27;m not talking about a losable gpg keypair, but something amazon generates and provides to you (like they do with their AWS services already) Amazon would then create a personalized stream for you, using that security token to encrypt. Since amazon provides the content and the key, they can replace your key at any time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://getaether.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getaether.net/</a>

Moreover, shifting from evolutionary biology to quantum physics, there is reason to disbelieve in preexisting physical truths: Certain interpretations of quantum theory deny that dynamical properties of physical objects have definite values when unobserved.</i><p>The properties that &quot;don&#x27;t have a definite value&quot; are much smaller than the properties that a cow or a human can sense. The properties of big objects can be estimated so correctly with classic mechanics that you can safely ignore the quantum mechanics effects.

This is related to another mysterious question: Is math an invention or a discovery?  Were prime numbers and linear algebra there before we came along, or do they emerge from the structure of our brains?  There are primitive tribes of humans who have not invented counting, so they are unable to distinguish 10 berries from 11 berries and do not experience integers as part of the natural world; they would probably consider properties of the integers to be properties of the act of counting if they had a mental framework for doing so.  So back to the first question, how much of what we find when we peer out into the universe and model it with particles and waves and math is in our heads, and how much is really &quot;out there&quot;?  If physics to date is unknowingly identifying the fabric of reality with the fabric of thought, then we should be able to take either reality or thought as primary and use it to explain the other.

The author takes conscious agents as the building blocks of reality, and the conscious agents are still there when you aren&#x27;t looking.  They are just a different representation.

I focus on introductory programming experiences for non-CS-major undergraduates. Some of that research involves block-based languages. The scaffolding is extremely helpful in getting them to write working code quickly, and that&#x27;s a valuable trade-off with &quot;real&quot; coding. Of course my goal is to transfer them into real coding (we use Mutual-Language Transformation a la Matsuzawa and embeddable code snippets a la Weintrop).<p>However, from what I&#x27;ve read of work with younger learners, you&#x27;d be amazed at the level of complexity their code can reach. Just because you&#x27;re young doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t write big complex programs. Of course, when they&#x27;re older they&#x27;ll look back on much of their work and say, &quot;Oh it&#x27;s so bad&quot;. But that&#x27;s just what learning means.<p>As for &quot;damaging&quot; learners - banish the thought. Short of actively lying and gaslighting students, I&#x27;ve always found learners to be extremely robust. In fact, technology and context have relatively little impact on young students long-term compared to positive, excellent interactions with educators who know what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s more important for students to have successful experiences that are fun and make them think, &quot;Hey, this does stuff! Like, real stuff!&quot; There are many nuances to that statement (gender is particularly fascinating), but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s mostly true.

9830173,comment,9828962,9828962,0,0,atinoda-kestrel,,,"Hmmm... I wonder if there&#x27;s potential to use this concept for video.  Not this implementation, naturally, but the concept.<p>I&#x27;m a little too sleep deprived to think through this entirely, but just off the top of my head, it seems like over the course of a few frames that an edge in motion would wind up as a series of triangles where one of the points remains static while the other two shift away from it -- in other words, the Trigrad approach would yield motion blur as an artifact.  And then when the next key frame comes along, the remaining point gets reselected, probably further along the motion path...  So much like a normal differential approach you wouldn&#x27;t need to store all of the point locations each frame, just the ones that change and which triangle they belong to.<p>It might be hard to make it stream-friendly though, since obviously the compression efficiency depends heavily on the storage structure (see pjtr&#x27;s comments)...",1436018789

I escape everything except [A-Za-z0-9,. ].<p>Attempts to sanitize HTML (or SQL...) by eliminating a set of ""dangerous"" inputs inevitably end up as whack-a-mole processes as people keep discovering new evil things to throw at you.  The only secure solution is to escape everything except a small set of ""safe"" inputs -- this is analogous to the situation with packet filtering firewalls, where ""default deny all"" is widely accepted as the right way to do things.",1218894544

Code samples in C# and Java are floating around, but I haven't seen anything like a project that's undergone serious testing and is being updated for new security threats on an ongoing basis.<p>Heck, I'd pay for a commercial component if it was well maintained.  Any suggestions?  Or, this being Hacker News - would someone want to create such a component as a mini-ISV startup?",1218893408

The answer is the same as it is to questions like ""what college should I attend?"", ""what's the best city to live in?"" or ""who's the smartest person in the world?"". It _depends_.<p>Although I do enjoy hearing someone's individual story or line of thinking, bashing one method over the other is ridiculous.<p>From my understanding of the capital expenditures/computing power involved, a Company like Heroku pretty much has to take investment of some sort (unless the founders are rich) or risk providing users with sub par performance. Companies like Wufoo not so much. There is no ""better"" method only a ""better fit"" for the type of business you have and are trying to run.",1218892239

Blockbuster.com gives horrible recs (I use their total access service) and I haven't found anything else worth mentioning.

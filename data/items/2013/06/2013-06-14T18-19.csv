5881756,comment,5881142,5881540,1,0,Uchikoma,,,"I pay you $1000 (or EUR) if you show me how you can be 3x faster from idea to live with RoR against something else, say Java/Play. If 50% of your time is HTML/CSS fixing,thinking,finding edge cases,testing,debugging,communication with customers etc. you need to be 6x faster. And not in the first 5 days but you need to maintain this speed even as your code size grows and more and more time is spent on understanding existing code.<p>The only way to reach 6x is with 3rd party libs you have in RoR but you have no equivalent on say the JVM. Massive code reuse is the only major productivity gain today.<p>[edit] Sorry my mistake. If 50% of your time is taken by other tasks when writing say Java code, the most you can achieve is doubling your productivity by reducing development time to zero. If you tripple your productivity during development, your overall gain is 33% I think (not that good with on the fly calculation obviously).<p>[edit2] Just realized, this is Amdahl&#x27;s law for developer productivity with your other tasks being the sequential fraction.",1371236396

Frameworks are invaluable for rapid iteration towards MVP proof, and fantastic for churning out web apps for mid tier companies with moderate (less than millions) traffic.  But if you&#x27;re going bigger, have a plan to get your bottlenecks closer to the metal, because with hundreds or thousands of servers, the savings becomes significant and possibly even crucial to your survival if your type of offering gets commoditized.",1371235920

Web APIs are most often IO bound, so large differences between frameworks often indicate the IO is handled differently. From my experience, dynamic languages can easily handle HTTP requests below 10ms without any DB interaction, and out-of-a-box DB interaction that framework provide is often suboptimal. If you investigate, it can for example turn out that ORM runs several SQL queries for operations that could  be performed with just one, or that it makes a separate DB connection for each request (looking at you Django).<p>Ruby 10x faster than Golang tells nothing.<p>Why is that there there is a big spike around 15,000 requests?

The same applies to your Point account, you will be able to continue to login at the usual domain using your existing username & password.

Which party thinks the government should regulate abortion as a crime, and regulate which kinds of partnership qualify for marriage benefits?  Which party thinks government should be trusted with truly massive budgets to use the US military to coerce other countries (as a possible measure of this, consider on whose watch the military budget grew, and on whose it shrank)?<p>By their works shall ye know them, I think?  I concluded that the Republicans were the party of big government.  Did I get confused again?<p>> <i>&quot;Paint the issue as giving the liberal administration the ability to snoop on conservative political organizations&quot;</i><p>Well, you can paint it any way you like.  In practice, I haven&#x27;t heard of any abuses of surveillance aimed at political conservatives, maybe excepting the KKK (who you may or may not see as &quot;political conservatives&quot; anyway).  Just look at how they spent the budget for COINTELPRO, a 15-year-plus abuse of FBI power to suppress political &quot;subversion&quot; (i.e. dissent with the status quo); 85% of that budget was spent on things like suppressing civil rights groups and anti-war protesters.  Admittedly, COINTELPRO is going back a long way; if you know of specific abuses that are more recent, I&#x27;d certainly consider that more-interesting evidence.<p>> <i>&quot;This is not a cynical argument&quot;</i><p>This, ultimately, is the part I&#x27;m questioning.  I think this proposal&#x27;s strategic suitability rests crucially on the distorted image that Republican voters have of the Republican party, and of the overall public discourse.<p>> <i>&quot;Moreover, people don&#x27;t care about &#x27;privacy.&#x27;&quot;</i><p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.",1371235260

The tories then turned around and rejected lords reform and the only measure the Lib Dems could retaliate with was killing boundary reform, which was a trivial issue nobody cared about.

So, in terms of effectiveness, the more effort you make the more effect it is likely to have, up to a point. If you make an appointment and visit them in person, you&#x27;re obviously serious, and even if they&#x27;re a loyal supporter of a party whose official policy is to promote the surveillance, they&#x27;ll have to look you in the eye and tell you to go away rather than just sending a form letter by automaton-mail. If enough constituents did that to fill up a few MPs&#x27; surgery days for a month, it would probably make quite a difference. Failing that, if you take the time to write a proper letter or ring them and talk to a real person at their office, at least they know you care enough to do something substantial. If you sign some e-petition or forward them the 253rd copy of a form letter on-line, it might be better than nothing, but it doesn&#x27;t demonstrate much more comitment on your part than making a &quot;me too&quot; post on an on-line forum, so it&#x27;s probably going to carry weight (or not) accordingly.<p>You could also donate to political groups/civil rights organisations like Liberty or the Open Rights Group, if you&#x27;re willing to put actual money on the line to help fund lobbying against these kinds of measures.",1371234410

You are essentially buying yourself time.  So the question is how much time do you need to buy yourself.<p>Ok, so even if you select a key length of something very large which depends not only on bytes of the key but also the encryption algorithm as well.  For a 4096 bit key that would be 1.0443888814131525066917527107166e+1233 combinations, assuming someone tried to brute force this at 100000 checks per second (a low estimate) it would take roughly 1.655867708988382335571652572800330388413185326368886003...  10^1220 years to crack on average assuming the birthday paradox.<p>2^4096 / 2 / 100000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365<p>So that&#x27;s a freaking long time to keep that data secure.  Even radically scaling up the brute force attack across the entire world would be akin to boiling the oceans.  (Not going to do out the cpu/watt/check number calculation to determine how much energy it would actually take compared to boiling the oceans...)<p>So are you safe?  No because starting in WWII very smart mathematicians were finding ways to crack the algorithms and find patterns and holes in the encryption solutions that made the search space orders of magnitude smaller.  So the best thing we can do is select well attacked, well researched but still secure systems, use a good key length and pray (I am not a religious man).<p>Edit: If you wish to be truly paranoid (don&#x27;t recommend it), most of the important crypto research has been done by state organizations, this is how AES was selected from a group of submitted designs to NIST.  Conversely there are few still secure and well researched algorithms besides AES out there, (Elliptic Curve basically, but those designs are under patents so not widely available etc)<p>Edit 2: Also wikipedia is a great starting point for understanding, but is not always complete.

On average they are around 700 bp, the odds of finding an exact match are about 700/4^18 - then a one bp mismatch is 700/4^17 times a 1:10 hit in terms of competitive binding.  Two bp mismatch is 700/4^16 times 1:100.  Then you have to consider that it&#x27;s evolutionarily unlikely to have segments that exactly or inexactly match tRNAs because the resulting dsRNA is likely to engage in silencing via the DROSHA mechanism - probably because our bodies like to guess what - get rid of ssRNA viruses.

When you put an electrode into the brain, you often end up recording the &quot;sounds&quot; of multiple neurons firing. To make sense of what&#x27;s going on, you have to identify which spikes came from which neurons. While there are fully automated algorithms for spike sorting, they aren&#x27;t widely used because people don&#x27;t trust them to work on real recorded data. Even if you use them, you probably want to check their results later, and you need a good GUI to do so. Right now, the &quot;state of the art&quot; is Plexon&#x27;s Offline Sorter (<a href=""http://www.plexon.com/products/offline-sorter%E2%84%A2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plexon.com/products/offline-sorter%E2%84%A2</a>), which is slow, occasionally crashes, and costs thousands of dollars per license. It&#x27;s mostly a GUI, and replicating it would probably not require much domain-specific expertise. The fact that it&#x27;s closed source actively prevents the development of better partially supervised spike sorting algorithms.<p>- Better fMRI data analysis tools.

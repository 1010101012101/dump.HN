And IME the <i>good</i> practices that are used in Agile processes mostly are the ones that were well-known and widely-used.<p>People have written automated tests for decades. People have been testing at the interface level since the dawn of OO and before. Put those together and you've got what is now called unit tests.<p>People have been making small changes to improve the design of code without changing its behaviour forever, too. Fowler published <i>Refactoring</i> in 1999, but even then it was common practice among experienced programmers to work that way. I assume you're not seriously going to suggest that no-one thought of doing things like moving a method up and down a class hierarchy or splitting a long function into a higher level control function using lower level functions for the details before the book was out. (I'm not disputing that Fowler did a good job of pulling a lot of common knowledge together in a way that is helpful to those just starting out.)<p>I also assume you're not seriously going to dispute that long-term projects have been managed using shorter-term milestones for a very long time. That's hardly unique to software development, never mind to Agile processes.<p>Every project I've ever worked on professionally has seen developers naturally pair up or form small teams around the same computer or whiteboard to work through difficult problems or review each other's solutions.<p>People have been doing what is called continuous integration today for as long as there have been source control systems with check-in hooks.<p>I first had the idea of organising a big project by keeping a pool of little projects and picking out the most important one to do next when I was about 13 or 14, so I rather suspect that plenty of managers were using the same idea to prioritise long before anyone called it a backlog and worked through it in sprints.<p>I could go on, but I think you get my point.<p>Now, there are plenty of other practices required by various Agile processes that weren't (in my experience) almost universal among good programmers before Agile came along. They include:<p>- TDD<p>- Full-time pair programming (same computer, two keyboards)<p>- Collective code ownership (everyone owns everything)<p>- Forcing short-term milestones into periods of exactly the same length<p>- Frequent meetings (daily in some processes)<p>- Relying on organic designs that evolve through arbitrary refactoring by individual developers rather than a carefully planned architecture and smaller-scale designs that are peer reviewed by multiple people<p>If you want to claim those as the gifts Agile has given us, you're welcome to them. As I said before, most of the <i>good</i> practices were already in use, and the consultants mixed in a bunch of unproven ones later.",1326851578

3477411,comment,3474911,3475193,7,0,6ren,,,"> I built myself a job I didn't want.<p>So the question isn't ""how can I make money?"" but ""how can I create the job I want?"".  An important part of this is ""what the heck kind of job do I want?""<p>The response ""I want to be independently wealthy"" seems to circumvent this, but it turns out that you will want a job after all. (If you don't believe me, you may need to find this out the hard way, as I did.) A good example is the viaweb crew, who got rich, then turned around and started another business (YC).<p>So why not create the job you want in the first place?  Though it's true that for some jobs (like being a VC), it helps to have a lot of cash, and a lot of hard-won experience - so creating the job you want might involve doing a lot of stuff you don't want to do. Actually, the nature of ""work"" is there is always some stuff you don't like. (Yet oddly, we seem to <i>need</i> that to be happy - like the failed Matrix's.)<p>On top of all this, there are so many unknown unknowns  in the world, that it's not realistic to even be able to conceive of your ideal job. (<i>nature's imagination is greater than your imagination; There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy</i>).<p>This is the very idea of lean, that you can't know what will work, so you can't plan it. Instead, you try experiments to get that knowledge, where an ""experiment"" is a low-cost way to get information. If it costs too much, it is no longer an experiment, but something else.<p>So... you can see yourself as on a journey to find out what sort of job you'd like. You might as well begin with what you <i>think</i> you'd like (e.g. where your passion is)... but it's overwhelmingly likely that your ideal job will come as a complete surprise to you.  So it doesn't really matter where you start, as long as you start.<p>""What color is your parachute"" has some exercises about discovering what kind of regular job you'd like, which can guide you in creating that job for yourself - but I think it's flawed in that you don't <i>know</i> enough about the world or yourself to be accurate. Still, it's a starting point.<p>The same goes for finding your passion. You can't know what it is, so start doing stuff.  You'll discover more about the world, and more about what you like.<p>On this reasoning, it might have given you interesting information to have built that billing system, to see if you liked the PR business. It might have lead to something else along those lines; or caused you to definitively go in the opposite direction.  You could still close it down - or sell it (or give it away). But if it really is in demand, a competitor would emerge! (this happened to me). So you aren't stuck with it, if you don't want to be.<p>In a wider sense, the feeling of having to support the project forever transformed an experiment into a life-choice.<p>BTW: I don't mean this to be targeted at you; I think your one idea per month for a year is really impressive, requiring a lot of guts and gumption. Maybe you were just a bit burned out at the end (I would be - I see ""gumption"" as my most critical resource). It's just that your story helped crystallise my present concern on ""creating a job I want"".",1326850375

It's still a well regarded brand, and many millions rely on it for email and as a homepage. It's finance section remains extremely popular. They purchased Sportacular, the app I use to keep track of games. \nTheyve just been very poorly managed. They acquired companies like delicious and Flickr, one they let wilted and the other they never really integrated into their platform- Flickr just feels like a freestanding entity. \nThey should cut out the garbage that doesnt get many users and should focus on their prized assets. They should push ahead in developing unique content for their viewers. It may be too late to get into the mobile OS game, but TV is still pretty wide open and Yahoo can really do something here, using their existing assets and by further developing or partnering with content providers. \nI'm hopeful.",1326849377

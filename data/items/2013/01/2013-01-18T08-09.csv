I have several times written something in a modern language and then convinced myself that I could get a large speedup if I instead wrote it in C, only to discover that the speed benefits were minimal at best and would require an exorbinant amount of exquisite hand optimization to increase further.",1358499519

Doing just one thing, you can be guilty both in computer fraud, unauthorized access, copyright violation, etc., etc. These are routinely used to a) intimidate the defendants and b) mislead the jury into thinking the defendant is a serious criminal (not one, but 15 charges! he must be guilty of at least something!) and gives strong incentive to ""split down the middle"" and convict on at least some of the charges. It is a routine trick, which is routinely used by prosecutors, and they know exactly what they are doing. In this case their intimidation has gone further than they intended, but otherwise they are not fooling anyone talking about how they really just wanted a small punishment and always told so to everybody. They bullied Swartz just as they bully everybody.<p>Analysis on Volokh's blog: <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/16/the-criminal-charges-against-aaron-swartz-part-2-prosecutorial-discretion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/16/the-criminal-charges-agains...</a> shows the number of the charges probably would not influence the sentence much, but greatly increases chances of conviction and creates serious chance for a long prison term if unsympathetic judge happens to be sentencing.",1358497612

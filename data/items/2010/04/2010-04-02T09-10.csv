If you hate the job and are just in it for the money you'll burn out and drop out pretty quickly. Investment Banking is pretty much dominated by people who love doing what they do, probably more so than the vast majority of other industries.",1270200364

If IPv6 were compatible with IPv4 in the first place, the ""various techniques"" wouldn't be necessary, and transition would have taken years, not decades.",1270199740

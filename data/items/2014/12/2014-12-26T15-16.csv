I&#x27;m disputing this:<p>>It&#x27;s worth noting that the original demand of the hackers was for money from Sony in exchange for not releasing embarrassing information. There was no mention of the movie &quot;The Interview&quot;<p>It very well could be an extortionist, but I think they clearly intended to give the impression that it was allegedly about The Interview, first subtly then explicitly. No public message, or leaked private message, was ever released that showed the hackers asking for money. It is possible they sent a private demand for money to Sony which has yet to be released, but that would just be speculation.<p>Their group name, constant requests to &quot;preserve world peace&quot;, releasing all sorts of movies and scripts except anything relating to The Interview, and then explicitly calling The Interview a &quot;movie of terrorism&quot; seems to show that they intended to use the movie as a bargaining chip from day 1.",1419609501

in the wild?<p>Henry Wu: Actually they can&#x27;t breed in the wild.
Population control is one of our security
precautions. There&#x27;s no unauthorized breeding in
Jurassic Park.<p>Dr. Ian Malcolm: How do you know they can&#x27;t breed?<p>Henry Wu: Well, because all the animals in Jurassic
Park are female. We&#x27;ve engineered them that way.&quot;<p>and later with three of the characters wandering in

dinosaurs are breeding.<p>Tim: But Grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.<p>Dr. Alan Grant: Amphibian DNA.<p>Lex: What&#x27;s that?<p>Dr. Alan Grant: Well, on the tour, the film said
they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence
gaps. They mutated the dinosaur genetic code and
blended it with that of a frog&#x27;s. Now, some West
African frogs have been known to spontaneously

Always.  Since the beginning of social computing - when we&#x27;ve all had access to the same degree of technology - our languages, tools, and frameworks have <i>always</i> been changing.  It is one reason for the existence of an ivory tower - sometimes you need to wizard-out, just to get peace from the noise.  Trouble is, you inevitably end up casting new spells.  There is no such thing as &#x27;a brand new thing&#x27; to learn, alas the truly hipster edge can&#x27;t be learned yet.  ;)",1419607044

Many individuals in our lab (including myself up until recently) write software for analysis and simulation without any understanding of basic coding best practices such as version control, unit testing, documentation, formatting for readability, or even commenting. This comes back to bite our lab in the ass frequently.<p>This occurs because many of our people take the code cademy course on python for example and then assume they &quot;know how to code&quot; when they finish; if they run into problems, they can simply consult stack overflow for anything they don&#x27;t know. They therefore never learn anything about formal software development best practices unless they put in extra effort to do so, which they generally don&#x27;t.<p>I have learned a lot trying to refactor over the last few months, and I have tried to pass on some of this knowledge to my labmates. We have actually come a long way over the last few months. We now employ version control, use style guides, and more robustly document programs.

For example, some of the methodologies with conducting hot-spot analysis is somewhat misleading, especially to uninformed geospatial analysts. For example, Esri [0] implements this first by conducting geospatial aggregation, then calculating z-scores based on Gaussian assumptions, then generates a corresponding &quot;p-value&quot; to extract &quot;statistically significant areas&quot; that are coined &quot;hot spots&quot;. At that point, an analyst typically color-codes those p-values showing regions with low p-values as &quot;extreme&quot; areas of interest. I&#x27;m really curious if there&#x27;s any empirical or anecdotal research that validates this methodology.<p>There are some attempts to try and normalize sampled data. Location Quotient [1] (and Standardized Location Quotient), for example, compares a local measure to a global measure. However, this too has Gaussian assumptions and doesn&#x27;t properly account for variance in the data.<p>I would definitely love to see a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model that takes into account a geospatial prior (such as the overall density of tweets) allowing you to solve for the posterior of cluster centers.

According to the Many Worlds interpretation, step (1) creates multiple Universes, each with a different ordering of the list.

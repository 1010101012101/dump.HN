after 200 designs, seeing many of my idea's incorperated into
other peoples designs, and some do it be better, but still.
I have decided to leave, no more free idea's from me for the other more experienced designers. The game is over, I unsubscribe, if I can figure out how, and leave it for what it is. The site owners make money on it now (39 credits a pop) , designers got free idea's, and I make more money now locally then I ever would make here. (like zero until now.;o) ) So I bid you all a farewell, it was an experiment for me, and I must say, with a negativ result.
I wish all the designers a good time here, and many profits, it was
a different experience and it was fun when it was free, also for the contest holders, but for now, I am gone. cheerio.",1209326581

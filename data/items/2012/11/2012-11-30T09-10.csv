I carefully used the word abuse.<p>Obviously there are different levels of abuse.  At the more severe[1] end are images where the child's face is clear; where the child is obviously younger than 18 (and probably younger than 12) and where a p----[3] or object is inserted in a va----, an--, or mouth.  At the less severe end are images  where there is only a single person, that person looks to be 18, that person looks to have been a willing model, and that person is partially clothed.<p>You say no mens rea required, and that is a troubling aspect of UK law.  (What does a sysadmin do if s/he finds an image of child sexual abuse on his/her computer, downloaded by a user?  Who 'owns' that image, and who goes to jail for it?)  But the courts are happy to use mens rea if it helps - a man with a conviction for child sexual abuse was visited by police, who found a tape he'd made from broadcast tv adverts.  He admitted he used this as masturbatory material, and was prosecuted.  And ""knowledge"" is required by English courts.<p>I'd agree that the law is a bit broken when we're talking about adult looking 17 year olds (a 17 and 11 month old with lots of life experience etc could be sensible enough to make that decision) or young looking 21 year olds.  (Someone who is 21 but appears to be under 18 is tricky area.)  Or the popular example of ""s--ting"" - someone under 18 taking a photo and sending that to a friend also under 18.  (Several laws potentially committed, especially if there's any persuasion going on.)<p>I kind of hope that police, prosecutors, and courts are balanced enough to not bother investigation, prosecuting, or convicting someone who has a collection of nude photos of people who are 18 but who might be 17; especially if there's no other offending happening.  But I realise I'm being optimistic.<p>For reference:
The Criminal Prosecution Service has some nice information (<a href=""http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/indecent_photographs_of_children/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/h_to_k/indecent_photographs_of_c...</a>)<p>Since the results of an investigation, charge, prosecution, or[2] conviction are so serious for the suspect it'd be nice if there was a bit of clarity.<p>[1] All child sexual abuse is severe.  So, now we're in that domain we re-calibrate the word severe.<p>[2] carefully chosen 'or'.<p>[3] fill in the blanks; avoided spam filter.",1354268685

4852579,comment,4851307,4851307,28,0,marmaduke,,,"A bit late, but a few comments on how this thing actually works:<p>In their model brain, they build functionality for 10 different tasks. These tasks were chosen to model those tasks used in psych evaluations, cognitive experiments, etc, so that the model can be compared to experiments with real humans. Good scientific choice there.<p>The user must design the function that she wants. The program then finds a particular network that can implement the function. This is like when you need to pay 55 cents, and you have a bunch of change, you can pretty much find multiple ways to make 55 cents (2 quarters + 5 pennies, 9 nickels + 1 dime, etc).<p>So for each task, they find a minimal mathematical description of the task in terms of eye movements, visual stimuli. Then, they fit a neural network to that description. This part is interesting neither scientifically nor mathematically, as we have known for 20 years that neural networks are universal function approximators. Look it up on google scholar, this is textbook stuff.<p>What IS interesting is what happens when they try to build up a brain, putting all these tasks into the same large network. This part is novel: they find that as they implement more and more tasks, it becomes easier to do so because they can adapt already existing components (like Daniel Dennett's exaptation) for use in the new task. This is vindication of evolutionary theory but in the context of cognitive neuroscience. Pas mal, as they say.<p>But these kinds of details aren't obvious unless you have domain knowledge and you've seen Chris Eliasmith speak a few times, and you've thought, mmm hold on a sec, show me them equations. (which he doesn't usually do).",1354268522

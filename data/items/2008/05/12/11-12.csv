Then I set it for 5 minutes, pick a small task, and try and get it done within that time without losing focus. Repeat that until I'm in the zone.",1210593572

There is still quite some frustration involved with getting devices supported and working correctly. Not to mention shipping updates to the application.<p>What tools/toolkits/platforms do you use?<p>I am interested in knowing how other mobile developers have handled this problem. One of the startups - Tsumobi kind off covered this problem but I have not heard anything from them.<p>My reasons for asking is we have this http://www.j-mango.com/ (click on the video link). We don't know if it will be useful but everyone we show it to is impressed.<p>What do you think?",1210593553

187486,comment,186911,186911,0,0,raganwald,,,"Apple's computer business may or may not thrive over the next decade, but beware the false dichotomy where the choice is between Apple thriving or Dell thriving. Dell is in the no-man's land where it actually isn't the cheapest supplier, as FSJ explains so sweetly, it has burned its customer loyalty, and it certainly doesn't have any cachet. And finally, they are at Microsoft's mercy, and the Vista debacle hurt them terribly. They needed an OS that would be a killer app: something that would drive customers to upgrade their hardware just to run Vista.<p>Without that, where are they going to find explosive growth? Music players? Anybody remember the Bic Lighter^H^H Dell DJ? Flat screen TVs? Selling American PCs to the growing Chinese market?<p>I can't tell you whether to go long AAPL. But I admire the balls of anyone going long on DELL.",1210593004

He&#x27;s a Stanford engineering grad with an MBA from a top 10 school, and he had considerable success in his engineering career before shifting to finance several years ago.<p>He spends most of his waking life analyzing about six medtech companies. That&#x27;s right, only six. One might assume that he knows a few things about each company.<p>And yet, whenever he recommends buying or selling one of their stocks, he&#x27;s wrong almost exactly 50% of the time. (I actually track his predictions.)<p>You might be good at picking individual stocks, but I don&#x27;t think he is. And if he isn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t think most people would be either--myself included. I&#x27;ll stick to the index funds.",1415426374

I was making into the 200K USD range here in Tokyo (non-finance tech) so I would disagree that ALL salaries are suppressed.  It is just a cultural point to ask for less money in Japan.  Most firms also have very low revenue points in comparative markets abroad.  So one could argue this is market pricing.  Japan is still half the size of the US by population but with an economy that has been stagnant for many many years.<p>Like anywhere in the world, you get what you aim for.<p>Of course this does not take away from some factual statements he made.  It is very hard to hire in Japan.  Business practices are archaic in many ways.  Technology is outdated (so few people know anything of Meteor, Angular, Go, D, R, etc).<p>I still prefer it though in many ways.

Not saying that what you are building is a bad idea, just wondering how you plan to compete with the hordes of restaurants that deliver and food delivery services for restaurants that don&#x27;t.

Now, if you allowed me to instantly hire wait staff, that would be a much more interesting idea. For example, I recently had a family party where I went running around like a mad person trying to make sure everything was in order. Having wait staff take care of my guests would have been great, but I don&#x27;t want to hire anyone anywhere near even part time, and I&#x27;d need someone roughly vetted and an authority I can complain to if something goes wrong.

8576136,comment,8575895,8575895,0,0,sachingulaya,,,"For context here is the original source of the quote from an NYTimes interview:<p>Several years ago, Paul Graham — whom everybody calls P.G. — began to film the interviews he and his partners held with prospective Y.C. inductees. When reviewing the footage, he focused on the interviews with start-ups that ultimately failed. Like any savvy marketing executive, he wanted to isolate patterns that portended ill, which he called “negative predictors.” He was already aware of a few — investors tended to be biased against older founders, for instance. “The cutoff in investors’ heads is 32,” Graham says. “After 32, they start to be a little skeptical.” And Graham knew that he had his own biases. “I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg. There was a guy once who we funded who was terrible. I said: ‘How could he be bad? He looks like Zuckerberg!’ ”<p>Watching the video footage, Graham noticed another correlation: the longer he took to decide a group’s fate, the less likely the group was to succeed. “When you have to talk yourself into something, it’s a bad sign — that’s true also of relationships, hiring and so many other parts of life.” (Graham has a rhetorical talent for moving swiftly from the valley to the universal.) But after ranking every Y.C. company by its valuation, Graham discovered a more significant correlation. “You have to go far down the list to find a C.E.O. with a strong foreign accent,” Graham told me. “Alarmingly far down — like 100th place.” I asked him to clarify. “You can sound like you’re from Russia,” he said, in the voice of an evil Soviet henchman. “It’s just fine, as long as everyone can understand you.”<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/y-combinator-silicon-valleys-start-up-machine.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/y-combinator-sili...</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see how the quote wasn&#x27;t received as a joke.",1415424975

I recall reading a post on HN a few (or more than a few) months back about a startup writing a post-op article with reasons about why they had been rejected by YC, and among them was some musing that maybe it was because they didn&#x27;t look like Zuck. pg responded in the comments not by saying that &quot;it&#x27;s a joke!&quot; but that they once made that mistake and learned from it. That would at least vindicate the NYT usage of the &#x27;meme&#x27;.<p>I do want to note, that on the face of it, it does not <i>sound</i> like pg was joking. Couple that with the fact that pg did say sometime ago that strong accents are a part of negative predictors.

There was a guy once who we funded who was terrible. I said: ‘How could he be bad? He looks like Zuckerberg!’ ”</i> So, YC <i>did</i> go on to fund this guy. Considering that YC is pretty competitive in choosing the right people and has a low acceptance rate... and this guy did get in, can it really be said that his looking like Zuck had zero sway?<p>I think pg & co. should just move on with this, not by trying to weasel out of this, but by saying they made a mistake and they&#x27;ll try to do better.",1415424622

8576121,comment,8571728,8572085,0,0,istvan__,,,"I think you raised valid concerns about the single node performance of Erlang. If you have a single node problem or you are looking for raw speed Erlang is not the best option.<p>The fun fact is that most distributed systems don&#x27;t really care about 7x slower too much. Those care about scalability, reliability and fault tolerance more. One of the most reliable software systems out there was written in Erlang and as far as I know, there are few system can match that sort of uptime[1]. There are few large scale systems in Erlang, including one Amazon AWS service[2], and bunch of others like WatsApp.<p>I also like to mention the VM that is pretty amazing. There is per process (not an OS process) garbage collection that enables Erlang to meet with super tight SLAs in terms of latency. Ideal for high scale websites, doing the routing, but also for moving data from A to B. The concurrency model is also one of the strongest features of Erlang. Message passing is very powerful and enables you writing asynchronous code that is still easy to read and follow. Go can match that probably with channels and go routines though.<p>If you care about single node performance you can either use NIFs[3] or if you not tied to Erlang chose a language that is focusing on that more.<p>1. <a href=""http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/talks/armstrong.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/talks/armstrong.pdf</a>\n2. <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110623221347/http://www.satine.org/archives/2007/12/13/amazon-simpledb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20110623221347/http://www.satine....</a>\n3. <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html</a>",1415424386

It&#x27;s not just gambling, it&#x27;s gambling against someone that can see the cards.<p>They may have better tools, but small investors have the advantage of being nimble.<p>If you&#x27;re trading say, 10K per trade on large-cap stocks, you can have your entire trade executed within 10 seconds without moving the stock price (thanks to HFT, but that&#x27;s another story).  This makes trading on swings much easier for the small investor.<p>And there are plenty of tools available for the small investor, most brokers will give you access to them when you sign up for an account.  Sure, you may not get streaming L2 quotes on a basic account, but you&#x27;ll get all the company information you need and access to basic real-time quotes.  If you want to get a little more sophisticated, you can use something like R to automate some of the information-gathering process, run models against historic data, or simply use it for very fancy charts (with every technical indicator known to mankind).<p>And, as has been mentioned, hedge funds, mutual funds, etc..., have different motives for trading.  Sometimes they are hedging, sometimes diversifying, often they&#x27;re very long term, etc...  They&#x27;re not always trading.  Even HFT is mostly arbitrage.  There&#x27;s still plenty of room for small to medium traders to make money.",1415424092

8576097,comment,8571728,8576011,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"You may want to read Aphyr&#x27;s analysis [1], which is rigorous and well written.<p>If you read the RabbitMQ documentation, they readily admit to the fact that the clustering support is not designed for unreliable network connections. It&#x27;s mentioned only once, and it&#x27;s easy to overlook.<p>Here&#x27;s a very quick, rough overview (it&#x27;s complicated):<p>RabbitMQ works by assigning queues to specific nodes. A queue is a physical thing belonging to only one node at a time; consumers, publishers and so on are distributed, but queues aren&#x27;t. If you lose that node, you lose the queue. If you get a network partition, the nodes in the other partition(s) will not see the queue anymore. Connected publishers and consumers will start barfing when their bindings no longer seem to exist.<p>RabbitMQ can mitigate these loss scenarios by mirroring queues. They call this &quot;high availability&quot;, or HA [2]. Each queue will have a master node and a number of slave nodes that maintain replicas. In the event of a cluster issue, a slave will be elected master.<p>Ironically, HA, despite its name and apparent purpose, still requires a stable network. It does not deal well with network partitions. It&#x27;s not really high availability. It is, I suspect, designed for situations when you wanted to take down a node manually, in a controlled manned, without disturbing a live cluster.<p>The reason, and this is the important part, is that when a network issue is resolved and the partitions can talk to each other again, RabbitMQ has no way of reconciling queues. If the partition divided nodes into sets A and B, then A will likely have promoted a mirror slave to a master, while B will have kept its master, or vice versa. When the partition is resolved, you now have two masters, whose queues have very likely gotten out of sync in the mean time.<p>When this happens, RabbitMQ normally needs to be manually restored; it will simply cease to work properly. Note that I&#x27;m talking about the case when the network issue <i>has been resolved</i>. The network is back, RabbitMQ isn&#x27;t. You need to decide which nodes should survive and which should be wiped, and this recovery process is manual. Of course, if this happens in the middle of the night, you have a potentional emergency.<p>Fortunately, RabbitMQ has a band aid on top of HA called &quot;automatic partition handling&quot; [3]. It offers three different modes of behaviour, of which autoheal is probably the most important one. In autoheal mode, RabbitMQ will automatically pick a winner to solve conflicts, and promote it to a master. This will result in data loss; the losing nodes will be wiped. Autoheal is actually pretty crazy, because it is lossy by design; the only way to find out if you lost any data today is by grepping the logs for autoheal messages.<p>Worse, due to the &quot;poor man&#x27;s database&quot; nature of RabbitMQ, doing any kind of manual recovery -- like dumping the conflicts, reconciling them, and dumping them back in -- is probably not realistic when it happens.<p>Note that even on a flawless LAN, RabbitMQ can get network partitions if your server has high enough CPU or I/O load. Another thing that can induce network partitions is soft kernel lockups, which is common enough in virtualized environments; for example, VMware&#x27;s vMotion can move a node from one physical machine to another, a process which can take several seconds, during which time RabbitMQ gets a fit. In such cases you&#x27;ll want to increase the &quot;net_tick_timeout&quot; [4] setting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.rabbitmq.com/nettick.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rabbitmq.com/nettick.html</a>",1415423558

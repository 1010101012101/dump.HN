This really couples the structure of your HTML to how it displays.  This works well for a while, but on bigger projects it has fallen down for me every time.<p>I've been finding that keeping my selectors no more than 3 deep is a good balance.  It also forces me to abstract container styles into re-usable bits, and name things properly instead of exploiting the structure of the HTML.",1323133073

Of course you might not need it for standard web development, but I think enough of a case could be made to include it in a preparation for CS.<p>Also, when we did the ""congruent triangles"" stuff in school, it was actually the most ""graphical"" way of conducting mathematical proofs. It was a very fun way to practice doing proofs. I don't even remember how much we continued to prove stuff in other parts of math. And again I think knowing about conducting proofs is useful/essential for CS.<p>Could it be that you never had the congruent stuff at school? Our teachers mentioned that there are alternative ways to do geometrical proofs (I think with mirroring and projections?), so your teacher might have chosen another route. Because the congruency stuff is really easy to remember imho, it seems likely you never actually heard about it.<p>Summary of ""the congruency stuff"" off the top of my head: two triangles are congruent if the have either three equal edges, or two equal edges with an equal angle between them, or one equal edge and two equal angles.

3317240,comment,3314676,3316700,3,0,cpher,,,"I upvoted both of you because you each raised some interesting points. The thing that piqued my interest was the analogy of ""feeling"" math like you ""feel"" music.<p>Early in high school (late 1980's mind you), I decided to take up percussion to play in our award-winning marching band. I started out on cymbals, but that was too simple. Then, I worked on the rudiments of percussion/snare drum. I had to work hard on the ""math"" of the musical notation, but I soon realized that I had a feel, an ""ear"" for complex percussion rhythms. And it jived with my already attuned ability in singing. There was something natural that ""just clicked.""<p>I see this same pattern in African spiritual music performed by people with no formal education. There's a natural mathematically knowledge they possess without any formal math education.<p>To me, music is just a higher abstraction of math. One that people with no math education can appreciate without even knowing why.<p>It's only when educated in math, that the ""resonation of the soul"" takes place. And I'll superficially agree with the reasons of the other commenters about why the education is lacking.<p>My point is that we don't have to teach them to <i>feel</i> anything about math. Some people will grok it at a deeper level than others and come to that realization on their own. But I think the overall analogy to music is pretty good. Mozart grokked music theory better than anyone alive today, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate his genius (given no formal training). And I couldn't integrate an equation today (15 years out of college), but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate math in my life.",1323132017

We are working with the kindergarten books and I think my daughter is doing OK. I think that everybody who values math education should do something like that with their children. The gain is just too big to ignore. My daughter is already thinking about addition and while she doesn't yet remember the addition facts she has no difficulty posing word problems as addition problems.<p>The books are not very difficult for parents to understand and give you a baseline that you can follow very closely.  Also, I hope that since it is unlikely that my child will do the same book in school I do not run the risk that the she will refuse to do math in school since she has already done the book.<p>Since you have the book you can set the pace based on how difficult the lesson of the day seems for the child. You can do one page per week or 10 pages per day (both these things have happened to me). Of course there can be several levels of understandings of the same lesson and in my case I usually am happy with the lowest level. To correct for that I do sequentially 2 different books that have the same material (Singapore Math provides multiple books for the same level). I skipped some chapters about weights and volumes since these seemed too involved for my daughter (3 at the time), but I have done everything else that is on these books.<p>I must say that until now this has been a wonderful experience for me. I have never needed to ask my daughter to do math, anytime she sees me free she asks for it herself. And almost always I am the one who tries to cut the lesson short, making sure that next day she will want to come back wanting more.",1323131427

The rest of the male population and their plight does not even register on the radar.<p>Yes, the problems should be fixed for everyone, and I also can imagine there are problems specific to women. Not sure they are always sexist, though. For example I also face problems as a father when I take care of my child alone at times. It occurred to me it might have parallels to the situation of women in IT. Namely, usually mothers meet other mothers (on the playground, at home, wherever). Now, if I want to meet other kids on my ""daddy day"", I feel a bit awkward. I haven't created the same networks that my wife did - hooking up with mothers starting from birth courses to frequent playground and mother group visits. I suppose I could call her ""other mother"" friends and visit them with my son, too. But it would feel a bit weird, at least at first (haven't actually tried it yet), because I am not directly their friend, I am only the friend of their friend. I wouldn't blame it on sexism, though, it is simply evolved historically, because they went to more kid related courses than I did. Even if I change the diapers once per day and my wife does it 6 times a day, it creates a distortion.<p>I am all for fixing the problem, but blaming the wrong reason is very counterproductive to that.

Apple has improved the product to a degree, but really, nothing has been changed except it has been modified to run only on an iPhone 4S.<p>Now to respond to claims by the Gizmodo toddler that reviewed it and kind of work your responses in here:<p>1. The ""find me an abortion clinic"" use case is flat out, utterly without a doubt retarded. You couldn't find a more manufactured controversy in the mobile space -- unless you go back to last week's now disproven ""carrier iq is an android rootkit put on by the carriers"" controversy. First off, no one, and I mean no one, searches for ""abortion clinic"". Both sides of the debate are aware of Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood doesn't list themselves as an abortion agency -- despite what you might have read at TheOnion.com. Searches that are REALISTIC Use Cases like ""Pregnancy Information"" or ""Family Planning"" or ""Birth Control"" or ""Morning After Pill"" provide realistic results.<p>Yes, you can find edge uses cases that lead to Siri-baiting like above. Just like you could Google Bomb so that when you search for ""idiot"" you get George W. Bush's Wikipedia page. (I wonder..does that make the Googlebot a lefty? See how retarded that kind of anthropomorphic-thinking is?)<p>2. The editor's complaints that he can't find ""the fastest route"" to the emergency room. You know what else you can do with a phone if you really need medical care in an emergency situation? Dial 911. Odds are an Ambulance will get you seen by a medical professional a lot faster than driving. (Also, Google Maps on the iPhone automatically shows traffic where available. It wouldn't be hard.)<p>3. Complaining about No Turn-By-Turn baked into the iPhone: This is entirely Google's fault -- as they obviously have an API for it, but are locking Apple out in what you could argue is an anti-competitive behavior. This is why Apple recently just bought a Map Tiling company. It's obviously to anyone following the mobile wars that Apple didn't expect Google to be so responsive and competitive in the mobile space -- probably because they originally partnered to write the Maps app for the iPhone. Apple plans on cutting Google out of the mobile map search space in the future. Not in time for iOS 5, but next year it will likely be a whole different ball game.<p>4. Siri is supposed to be App-aware? Where did Apple market that? Complaining about use cases Apple hasn't even considered is childish. What next, complaining that there isn't a third-party API for other Apps to integrate with Siri (which will likely show up in the next year or so...)?<p>5. Where are these so-called Apple users that expect ""Apple Magic"" all the time? Because as a technologist, I'm guessing they don't exist. At all. Anyone who's used an Apple product for more than an hour understands that it's still a product, made here on planet earth, with it's on quirks and bugs. Every iPhone user has had to reboot their iPhone. Or had a download go bad. Or had dropped calls because AT&T is terrible. Or had to find a turn-by-turn GPS on their own. Same goes with Macs. Apple is know for high-quality design. For reducing the use case to such a minimal number of steps that seems so easy it might as well be ""magic"". In the auto space, BMW holds a very similar reputation. They are considered pricey, but worth it. A top notch driving experience. Well designed, well made, etc, etc. But the auto press is very much aware that like all other cars, it has an engine, moving parts, and can problems. They don't ""magically"" expect it to suck their dick to high heaven.<p>In comparison, Android's voice recognition isn't Siri. It can search the web, but it can't search wolfram alpha or the yellow pages, or Yelp, or any of the other databases Siri is in. With Siri, you can say ""Call me a cab"". With Android, you have to have a cab company programmed into your phone. To equate the two is short sighted, at best, and technically ignorant at worst.",1323130679

Do we need filtering routers on every border?\nWhat happens when I peer with a different provider over a new circuit that's not connected to the current Internet?  At what scale does that become 'the Internet Too'?\nI2, Lambda Rail, ESNet, etc.  There are dozens of HUGE, international, not-the-internet networks running IP with IANA assigned address space, etc.  Do these count as 'The Internet'?<p>When Cogent and L3 decide to have another spat and de-peer, and the world now has two congruent but unequal routing tables, without full reachability or visibility, which one is The Internet?  Do we now have 2 Internets?<p>And back to the Public Infrastructure - does the US presume to provide rules and regulations over the national infrastructure of other countries?  Many nation states have monopoly, government owned network / phone service providers - does the US really think they can dictate what those other countries do?  And if the regulations only apply to stuff 'physically' in the US...well, what's physically mean in a virtualized, cloudy world?<p>To use your analogy - I own the property and the pavement of the roads around my house, and they are NOT public roads (ie: private development, shopping mall, etc.).  The DoT doesn't enforce any law, such as speed limit, equipment condition, etc. on these types of setups - only on the Public Infrastructure.

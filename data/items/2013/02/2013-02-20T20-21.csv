5253287,comment,5252054,5253157,4,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""Being a nice person will not only earn you any affection you crave but the opposite, contempt for being an agreeable person.""</i><p>This has not been my experience.  I like nice people, and dislike assholes.  I know plenty of other people who feel the same.  Of course, there are people who are attracted to assholes, but if you're interested in their affection then you might want to take a deep, hard look at why.<p><i>""Professional help is an oxymoron. Psychiatrists waste money and time.""</i><p>There are lots of different types of psychiatrists and psychologists in the US and around the world.  The most popular type of therapy in the US right now is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), but there are many, many others.  If one therapy (or one therapist) doesn't work for you, that doesn't mean that another won't.<p><i>""In my humble opinion, fundamental human problems involve three things, social class, money and sex.""</i><p>You might want to look at Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs.[1]  From most basic to the highest needs, they are:<p>* Physiological needs<p>* Safety needs<p>* Love and belonging<p>* Esteem<p>* Self-actualization<p>* Self-transcendence<p>Your ""social class, money and sex"" only really cover the bottom four levels, and completely ignore the need for self-actualization and self-transcendence.  While Maslow's heirarchy is controversial, I personally think it's quite myopic to ignore the need many people have for getting beyond the lower levels in to the quest for self-discovery, self-development, and self-transcendence.<p><i>""Shrinks will not grant you any of those things. You have to do the dirty work yourself.""</i><p>Psychologists and psychotherapists can certainly never ""grant"" you anything except a (hopefully) sympathetic ear.  A good therapist can also help you get insight and offer good advice, but you will certainly have to do a lot of hard work in the therapy session and as homework.  To think that on your own you can achieve anywhere near the amount of insight, healing, and growth that you could with the help of a good therapist is (usually and for most people) overly optimistic.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>",1361393788

I was hoping that the evolution of the language would make it less painful than it used to be.<p>I was unimpressed. Generics are better than nothing, but still dramatically worse than having a reasonable syntax for anonymous closures. The newer iterator syntax is better than nothing, but still maddeningly lacking in the most basic type inference -- any compiler that can't infer the type of ""thing"" here is stupid:<p><pre><code>    ArrayList<MyClass> list = this.buildList();
    for (MyClass thing: list){
        ...
    }

The programmer is still forced to overspecify and manually convert between types like ArrayList<Thing> and Thing[], even though 95% of the time the difference has no impact worth thinking about.<p>I could go on, but my point is that people like me who dislike Java dislike it for fundamental reasons.

5253269,comment,5250308,5252958,1,0,Terretta,,,"Generally I'd agree with you. And generally I think these releases are PR.  But the sentence in question ""feels"" more sincere than that to me:<p>She said it's <i>""important that the page be dynamic, that it feel very fresh, and that it be very intuitive, and that it really tries to embody beautiful design""</i>.<p>In context, I don't think the first word, ""dynamic"", means AJAX, I think it means conveying energy or excitement.  Putting the ""Yaa-hoo!!!"" back in Yahoo, if you will.  The hero images change out.  The weather, stocks and scores are up to date.  On the iPad, you have an edge to edge (full bleed) hero image and thumbs you can scroll to.  On the iPad, it does ""feel"" dynamic without being annoying.<p>The next word, ""fresh"", is the opposite of what Yahoo's been for a decade.  The Yahoo look until not long ago still hearkened back to its curated directory days.  <i>When visited from an iPad</i>, her new design does feel up to date, without feeling like it came from Bootstrap Template Monster Ville.  You can recognize at a glance that this is not MSN, AOL, et. al.  (However, when visited on a desktop, I think it feels more like a shuffled iGoogle, so not so fresh.)<p>There is a risk in ""intuitive"" in that it's crucial for the Yahoo audience which is a little older and more change averse.  In this case, the word needs to mean approachable and immediately grokked by their majority.  Grandpa needs to be able to find his scores and grandma her horoscope. I suspect this word used here signals why this page isn't singing and dancing with undiscoverable swipe style affordances.<p>The ""beautiful design"" is the hardest to accept, if visiting from the desktop.  On the iPad, I was struck how nice it looked.  On the desktop, I think she might be bringing too much Google to her aesthetic.  ""Clean"" is not equal to ""beautiful"", and I'm not even sure it's clean given the use of grey hairlines and shaded boxes to delineate content areas.  A more ""beautiful"" design might, for example, convey the content area boundaries aesthetically, and have the grey hairlines and shading show up only when the gear (settings) and X (close) icons are needed.  With a decade of Google behind her, she probably does consider this presentation more ""beautiful"" than any of the section home pages you reach from this page.<p>Word by word, I think she used the best words she had on hand for what she was directing her redesign team to come up with.  I like that she talked about how it ""felt"" rather than just metrics.<p>If you spitball a bunch of terms you want your home page to convey, this isn't a bad list. Perhaps these particular words sound overused because, well, a home page like Yahoo's needs these words as priorities.<p>I didn't read her comment as insincere or corporate speak or even marketing speak.

I have noticed that tabloid papers lean on this style of language more than traditional broadsheets - for me it is this (deliberate) literary lazy folksiness that sets them apart rather than mere content. Note Amis puts an elitist accent on clich breaking Orwell's #5 but I like it because it reminds us that it is cleeshay rather than cleesh and I am not afraid of foreign tongues :)<p>Philosophy is another area (besides law) rife with jargon and, if I may say, prolixity. It is an area here care is rarely taken to express oneself plainly and simply. Schopenhauer has an essay called simply enough 'On Style'[2] which starts out ""Style is the physiognomy of the mind, and a safer index to character than the face."". I use this as a guiding light. Some philosophers are too important to avoid regardless of style (Hegel, Kant, Luhmann) but I am always and everywhere suspicious of any who are too verbose and needlessly opaque (Quine springs to mind). This is why I love Nietzsche so much, whatever you may say about his ideas - my God - his turn of phrase is sublime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Against_Clich%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Against_Clich%C3%A9</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/lit/contents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/lit/cont...</a>",1361392797

In fact, it's probably harmful, because it's the number one, most predictable piece of advice anybody can expect to get. So, being told over and over again to ""find professional help"" -- a task which is dramatically more difficult than the effort required to write those three words -- just makes people want to talk about their problems openly <i>even less</i>. i.e., ""I'd talk about it, but they'll just tell me to find professional help, I really don't need to hear <i>that</i> again.""<p>It's also harmful in that it's another kind of a dismissal. Surely you can see that ""find professional help"" could be interpreted as another way of saying, ""Go away, I can't help you""?

I always reckoned that they were using a simple model in which a button press would cause the ""WALK"" signal to always be fired at the corresponding light configuration at the _next_ cycle start. This is most likely a safety consideration because, as you noted, there may not be enough time to safely cross.<p>In some complex intersections I've noticed that the 'cycle start' doesn't necessarily line up with the corresponding configuration for the walk button which was pressed. This may result in having to wait nearly two complete cycles for the walk signal in the worst case (pressing the last configuration's walk button immediately after the cycle start). The resulting behavior could be considered a bug, or perhaps just more consideration payed to vehicle traffic. But it is certainly frustrating as the pedestrian.<p>At many intersections I cross now the signals are automatic with the traffic flow. Most of them also contain a countdown timer indicating the number of seconds until the light changes. It seems that this behavior would be a good tradeoff for pedestrian efficiency and safety. However it comes with a bit of trust from the gov, that you know you can't walk across 5 lanes in 2 seconds.",1361391581

5252951,comment,5251854,5252186,1,0,cpleppert,,,">>In France, the verb 'work' is travailler. Traditionally this meant literally to toil, a chore, an obligation. In Germany, the word werken means to build, create, do. The German word more aligned with travailler is arbeit. This lack of correlation in the word work I believe may explain the differences in the approach and cultural views towards work that I see across Europe, particularly with latin root romance languages.<p>This makes no sense at all. What is the mechanism at play here? Languages with different etymologies for the verb to work impress those differences into the cultures that use the language? Travailler doesn't really mean toil at all, besogne is the word for really hard chores, lit. Travail pnible. There is no connotation that work is always a chore. French has the same type of words for making things as German goes. This goes back to the agriculture/craftsmen distinction in the middle ages. There is no difference.<p>>>The second factor I've seen is climate. In the more productive northern European countries, it's generally colder. There's been a historical need for produce and for people to work (not endure or arbeit) to trade in order to get everything you need in terms of food and shelter.<p>Productivity isn't equivalent to working hard at all. Differences in productivity and wealth in european countries generally go back to pre-industrial developments in technology. Hotter climates tend to not be as integrated into Europe due to simple geography. The alps and the Pyrenees are two examples.  You can also look at political developments that helped give rise to reliable systems of law absent elsewhere. As an Arab commented during the crusades, the crusaders could depend on freedom from arbitrary judgments. Again, this development seems to be based on geography

5252899,comment,5251233,5252707,21,0,brianwski,,,"Disclaimer: I work for Backblaze.  The answer to almost every question put to us is ""total cost of ownership"".  Facebook stores a lot less data per customer than Backblaze and makes more per customer than we charge.  Facebook can afford to waste more money than we can, so they do.<p>In my humble opinion, there is A LOT of wasted money in making datacenter machines easy to service.  We create a little spreadsheet (it isn't rocket science) which includes the employee salaries taking into account different designs and how long it takes to open up and service a pod.  For example, to access the Backblaze Pod's hard drives you must pull the pod out like a drawer and open the top.  Many servers you can access all the hard drives from the front, without moving the server.  Accessing drives from the front is much faster -> but you lose 2/3 of the density!!  We pay $600 per month for a cabinet, just for the physical space.  We can stack 8 pods in that cabinet, or about $75 per pod per month in space rental.  So buying servers that are 1/3 as ""dense"" but easier to access drives from the front costs Backblaze $50/pod/month or $600/pod/year.  We open a particular pod and replace a failed drive or fix some other problem maybe once every 6 months-> so you are paying $300 <i>PER</i> <i>INCIDENT</i> if you have front mounted drives that save the technician maybe 10 minutes of time. The math simply doesn't make any sense at scale.<p>I think a lot of the inefficiency is because the datacenter employees recommend these ""nice to haves"" to their managers to make the datacenter employees lives easier.  But their company pays dearly for not doing the math.  This isn't important if your company is massively profitable or if it isn't a ""datacenter centric"" company like Backblaze.  But for us, it's the difference between life and death.  Remember, we only charge $5/month and we don't have any deep pockets so we have to stay profitable -> there isn't a lot of margin in there to be wasteful.",1361390455

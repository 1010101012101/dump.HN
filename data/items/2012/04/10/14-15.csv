3822415,comment,3821549,3822066,17,0,justinschuh,,,"I think ""they have"" is a bit overstated, unless you just mean they've shown improvement in the last few years. Things like functional ASLR and more use of seatbelt in Lion are definitely headed in the right direction; however, there seem to major gaps in testing and validating security--even basic stuff like continuous fuzzing and automated security testing. Also, their response and turnaround time is generally worse than Microsoft's (close to a year has not been uncommon). I can understand Microsoft's slowness due to their massive compatibility matrix and enterprise customer base--but Apple doesn't have that excuse. Apple has also been historically ignored as a mass malware target, so maybe a 500k node botnet is a helpful wakeup call.<p>And just to be clear, I'll admit that I'm not a disinterested party here. The Chrome security team carries the bulk of the WebKit security workload (fuzzing, auditing, fixing, etc.). That consumes a tremendous amount of my team's time, and prevents us from focusing more on Chrome. So, I'd definitely appreciate it if Apple were significantly more proactive about security.",1334069784

It is a process of incremental advances, requiring a large research community for any sort of reliable progress, and in which the nature of forthcoming discoveries are telegraphed by the nature of the work today. If you think that scientific breakthroughs are the way in which the world works, then you might be sitting there expecting significant advances in engineered human longevity to arrive no matter what the state of the present research community. Because some people are working on it, right? And it's just a few scientists and a eureka moment, right? Sadly not. One of the biggest challenges facing us today is that there is no large rejuvenation research community, and if we want to see real progress, that community must come into being - large enough and vigorous enough to match the stem cell research community pace for pace.""<p>The seed of the rejuvenation research community of tomorrow is the SENS Foundation and its allies, advisors, and supporters in the life science community. Much of their work today is not just in producing research progress, but laying the groundwork for the next twenty years of work: the people who build the applied technologies of mitochondrial repair, biomedical remediation of amyloid and AGEs, rejuvenation of the lysosome, and so forth, are in college today.

If you uploaded my brain into a robot and we both woke up, he'd say he was the real me and I'd say I was the real me. An outside observer could not tell the difference--it would be theoretically impossible to. If you killed one of us, one of use would feel like he died, the other wouldn't. Both of us would feel like we'd lived an entire lifetime before this moment because we'd share the same memories. This is the farthest one can ever dig into this problem. An ego is a side-effect of a functioning mind, it's not something with a unique physical location or material continuity. I think it's highly unsatisfying from our ego's perspective to think of uploading like this, but our ego also wasn't designed to think of itself in these terms any more than it was designed to visualize 4+ physical dimensions.",1334069428

But chemical reactions with other molecules in the extracellular space occasionally result in a chemical bond (a so-called crosslink) between two nearby proteins that were previously free-moving, impairing their ability to slide across or along each other and thereby impairing function. It is the goal of this project to identify chemicals that can react with these crosslinks and break them without reacting with anything that we don't want to break.<p>""In 2011, we established a Center of Excellence for GlycoSENS and other rejuvenation research at Cambridge University and hired postdoctoral student Rhian Grainger to design and perform experiments to develop reagents that can detect proteins bearing glucosepane crosslinks, facilitating further studies on its structure, abundance, and cleavage by small molecules. We also established a collaboration with researchers at Yale University, who will lend their expertise in generating advanced glycation end-products and lead efforts in developing agents which may be able to cleave glucosepane.""",1334069152

It doesn't matter for banging out HN comments or emails, but for code, I don't think I could put up with it.  It's bad enough having to use the text editors in Eclipse and IntelliJ; regressing all the way to browser text boxes would be a tragedy.<p>Is it for the sake of having persistent server sessions that don't go away when you close your client?  That could easily be done, and has been done, without resorting to using a web browser.  I admit that Emacs with Slime is not a paragon of simplicity and reliability, but I suspect it would be easier to recreate the convenience and polish of a web UI in an independent client (possibly based on a hacked version of Chrome or Firefox, if you really, really like your browser) than it would be to turn a text box into a decent code editor.",1334069148

Creating a name is a problem that every new startup (or product) faces, and for most people, it's a time-consuming and difficult process.<p>There are a lot of naming firms out there, but almost all of them are too expensive for a small startup (most charge $10,000 - $20,000+ minimum) and have questionable results. So, I (along with a few part-time friends) set out to offer a better product for a reasonable price - $299 per project. Since we're just starting out, the first 10 customers will get 50% off ($149).<p>A common question is ""why wouldn't I just create a name myself?"". Our answer is: if you want to make your own name, go ahead - many companies have. Check out our site for some naming tips. But, the idea is that if you're an average person, it's probably a waste of your time and your company's time. Not to mention that it's probably not your expertise (naming is as much a skill as anything else).<p>Some quick math: let's say you're worth $50-100 an hour (an average tech professional). If you spend any more a few hours, you're losing money. As many founders can attest, it can take weeks (and sometimes even months) to run through the naming process and come out with a winner - and it might not even be a good name. It really just comes down to economics: specialization is vastly more efficient - you're good at  X, and we're good at naming.<p>All in all, you get quite a bit for your money. Each project comes with a detailed PDF report that analyzes each of the 5 names according to our methodology, which includes every metric you could possibly think of.<p>----<p>I'd be glad to answer any questions here, or via email at (Contact at Nomvilla.com).<p>----<p>Some links (from the nav bar):<p>How we create and analyze names: <a href=""http://www.nomvilla.com/methodology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nomvilla.com/methodology</a><p>Names we've created: <a href=""http://www.nomvilla.com/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nomvilla.com/portfolio</a><p>Case studies and other articles: <a href=""http://www.nomvilla.com/case-studies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nomvilla.com/case-studies</a><p>An example of the report you'll receive (PDF): <a href=""http://nomvilla.com/wp-content/uploads/images/Nomvilla-Sample-Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nomvilla.com/wp-content/uploads/images/Nomvilla-Sampl...</a>",1334068359

Hedge funds have had big outflows in the last 3 years. That (risk-seeking)money has to slosh somewhere. The total size of the hedge fund world is larger than in 1999-2000. \nAlso, the concentration of advertising dollars that flows through a few key companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc., is significant. Ad spending basically drives this whole thing from the revenue side. In 1999 there was less of this money in absolute terms and also the ad and marketing folks had not yet learned how to target ads to users online.<p>So ads + Quantitative Easing (hope I am not getting too fast and loose here but this is shorthand) means that worthless companies like Instagram can seem strategic to ad delivery platforms like Facebook. And there is so much extra risk capital chasing deals that $1B is nothing to throw away.<p>PG has been in the right place at the right time, but just because he and his partners do things differently in their business does not mean that the macro picture is not the most important factor.<p>edit - we have <i>not</i> matured we have just gotten better at online advertising and marketing.

3822226,comment,3820431,3821389,9,0,mechanical_fish,,,"An important thing to remember about PHP is that it really isn't stuck in 1996: When we say <i>PHP</i> you need to think <i>WordPress</i>, or <i>Drupal</i>, or <i>CakePHP</i> or <i>Symfony</i>, since that's what one actually uses nowadays. Novices are steered away from code that pipes SQL injections directly to the database, and toward one of these frameworks, which does the heavy lifting for you so that you don't need to reinvent the wheel.<p>For years I consoled myself by calling myself a ""Drupal developer"". I'm not a PHP developer; if I weren't using Drupal I wouldn't touch the language with a ten-foot pole.<p>But I agree that basic PHP is optimized for the style of web development that dates back to 1996: Server-side rendering of HTML templates. (More powerful PHP - the underpinnings of the PHP frameworks, the stuff one gets in the latest versions like objects and namespaces and closures - basically turns the language into the equivalent of every other scripting language, though obviously much more inconsistent; there's no great reason to choose any of that over Python or Ruby except that it <i>degrades gracefully to PHP</i>, which may actually be very important, but only so long as what you're building looks superficially like a server-side-rendered HTML template from 1996.)<p>One reason why I'm spilling 10,000 words on PHP is that I've been working with it for five years now, but I'm having trouble getting excited by its future. It has a long future, because 1996-style web sites are not going anywhere: WordPress.com has a zillion users and Drupal is taking over the enterprise and, well, Facebook.  But one eventually gets tired of living in 1996. And PHP is useless for client-side-rendered ""HTML 5"" views, or mobile app client development, and its advantages as a templating language become moot if your server-side code is just an API coughing out JSON objects RESTfully. No newb can figure out that stuff today - even wizards can't agree on the proper  semantics of REST, for example - and if ever we do develop a framework for designing RESTful APIs that's as easy for novice programmers to pick up as PHP is for 1996-style templating, I'm betting that framework won't be built in PHP.<p>But maybe I'm wrong.

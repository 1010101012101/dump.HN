I don't think it is because others aren't capable but rather aren't interested or forced to. This type of person is definitely a rare breed which is good. I think a lot of people say they would like to fall into this position but in reality probably not so much.<p>Please keep in mind that I have met quite a few people that dabble in everything but a true professional at both is quite rare.",1324400391

They've made too much progress, established too many economic links, gained too much international influence to throw it away on a stupid war that, even in ""victory"", would be a loss.<p>They don't even have an idealogical interest -- we throw around the word ""communist"", but North Korea's modern ideologies are so far removed from Chinese communism that it's practically apples and oranges.<p>And the Cold War is long over, nobody's out to ""eradicate"" or even ""contain"" communism.

Obviously it's a little harder if you're targeting JVMs <v7 as you don't have invokeDynamic to play with, but most of that work will be common to an interpreter or compiler.

There's room for a lot of improvement in the graphic design  what's often derisively called ""just the way it looks""  of most digital products. Graphic/visual designers were somewhat restrained by low resolutions and slow GPUs. Evolving display technology will give rise to better graphic design both in the web and other digital products.<p>Good interface designers should definitely know the basics of the technologies used to implement their creations, in the same way industrial designers are expected to have some understanding of materials and manufacturing processes. It's often said that designers thrive on constraints: a designer does his best work when he knows the limitations of his tools, and works with their limitations and defects to create something useful instead of pursuing some impossible level of perfection. Designers, too, have to ship, and they ship best when they know what's behind the facade.",1324400137

Any design done in a static medium is going to change when actually implemented on a device, for a platform. But it could just as easily be Flash as HTML.   Good designers understand and account for the target medium (flexible sizes, variable fonts etc).<p>Also I reject your initial hypothesis. With a knowledgeable designer's design I can get a pixel perfect HTML implementation.

Your test is a problem where they are theoretically evenly matched. The interesting question is: do the benefits of native code etc, that you get when using an array outweigh the costs that you incur for using a non-optimal data structure for a given problem? To answer this you would need to come up with a situation where a list should be faster if the array and list were both native or both higher level ruby implementations. Then compare the actual running times to see what impact native code vs ruby code has.<p>All your test shows is that in a problem where neither data structure has an advantage in complexity, i.e. they both perform in O(n), the one backed by native code is faster.

The only question was how to do it without a corresponding increase in staff (...and capital, and headaches).<p>So I thought up Hypnotizr: http://www.hypnotizr.com<p>Hypnotizr provides online hypnosis sessions by sequencing together snippets that are recorded in advance. It's an inexpensive way to deliver well-made recordings that are also customized to individual clients' needs. With good voice control and a little post-processing, it sounds like one continuous recording. Nobody else is doing hypnosis like this, but I believe it strikes a good balance between personalization and cost.<p>Currently this is just a minimum viable product. To launch cheaply, I built the site using Drupal and Ubercart (with a lot of CSS/Javascript help from brianfarr, who you should hire if you ever get the chance: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3152012). I'm fulfilling orders by hand. If this site gains traction, I'm planning to hire a developer to rebuild the website from scratch, with automation for the session construction process (which isn't trivial, since some judgement-based decisions are involved). I'll probably rework the recordings too, depending on initial user feedback.<p>In any case, I'm hoping that this will be viewed as a ""good enough"" service compared to a bona fide hypnotherapist, for an affordable price.<p>If you have any thoughts on the website or the service, I'd appreciate your comments. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, e-mail me at support@hypnotizr.com and I'll give you a test session for review.",1324399149

The password that encrypts a user's credit card data is almost certainly not the password a customer logs in with. It's some highly controlled password that only some privileged authentication server knows.<p>The goal is to reduce the attack surface, and prevent incidental discovery of data. For example, I could set up a server that manages high security passwords and only grant access to a select few trusted people. I have to carefully audit how that server gets used, and who can use it, but I can let any old DBA mess around with all my encrypted data. I can throw it on any old server, I could outsource it to some cloud hosting company, it doesn't matter. That's a huge win in some industries.

If you watch closely, it's the same recipe applied to Iran and Irak.

No, but still they are seen as the aggressors here and not US which is all over them spying and making plans and publicly announcing that ""nothing is off the table"".

3373863,comment,3372503,3373516,15,0,jseliger,,,"""There is a psychological growth phase which involves separation, and that is one manifestation.""<p>I wonder if this phase is actually about teen social structures and hierarchies as they've developed in Western countries. I'm reminded of something pg wrote in ""Why Nerds Are Unpopular:"" <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a> :<p><i>I'm suspicious of this theory that thirteen-year-old kids are intrinsically messed up. If it's physiological, it should be universal. Are Mongol nomads all nihilists at thirteen? I've read a lot of history, and I have not seen a single reference to this supposedly universal fact before the twentieth century. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance seem to have been cheerful and eager. They got in fights and played tricks on one another of course (Michelangelo had his nose broken by a bully), but they weren't crazy.</i><p>So I wonder if a large fraction of the age group want to reject their parents because of the way they've been raised and schooled.<p>You obviously didn't argue that this phase is universal, but I still find the idea interesting.",1324396981

It happens all-the-frickin'-time in English.<p>edit: as far as examples in detail, I have none, but I would honestly be <i>extremely</i> surprised if there were fewer than a dozen in the world's current state, probably hundreds through time.  If I come up with one, I'll be sure to include it.<p>In the meantime: do you wish to argue that <i>all</i> such acts (name of culture => modified name as product => simplification dropping the modification) are offensive, or is this one somehow worse?  I ask not to ridicule, but that this stance seems (to me) to be relatively new or rare, and favoring this instance as something far more offensive than I would find it if applied to me (Best Buy's Geek Squad being a mostly similar example, OTOH.  I find them mildly annoying, but nothing more).<p>Basically, you (the collective-you, that is) have a point, but I and probably many others here think you're overreacting, though we might be swayed by a convincing argument.",1324396964

HTML+CSS+JS(coffee!)+Ruby, years of professional experience doing UX and website design on whiteboards and Photoshop and Illustrator, successfully launching brand-new projects.<p>I also know a few guys I've worked with that are very strong in the same areas. It's more pleasurable to work with a team where every member will do well in all areas, even if we have a core area that we would prefer to be an expert in. I don't believe those people are mythical or hard to find.<p>The myth is that startups want those people, but don't have enough money to afford them. They want desingineers that are cheap.

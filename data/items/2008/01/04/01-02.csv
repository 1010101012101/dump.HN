I was wondering if all the founders had to sign an NDA for the dinner conversations, since they were ""off the record"".<p>I'm sure I'm being too nosy. It really isn't any of my business.  I was just curious.",1199411800

For example, in the Gum Thief, the last chapter is written from the point of view of a university professor critiquing a novel written by one of the characters in the book.",1199410269

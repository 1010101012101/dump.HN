The issue submitter, investigator, and closer is the same person, Tavis Ormandy.<p>As reported by Ormandy: &quot;This isssue appears to be resolved in version 4.2.5.169 of the chrome extension, which looks like it&#x27;s about to be made available for update on the webstore...&quot; and then, a few days later: &quot;I believe this issue is resolved now, but inline installations are disabled while the CWS team investigate possible policy violations.&quot;.<p>> It sounds to me like the following happened...<p>It&#x27;s clear to me that that&#x27;s not how it went down.

It&#x27;s an important question.<p>After you&#x27;ve achieved enlightenment, remember that <i>Tavis Ormandy is not some hack</i>. Go do a bit of research on him and who he works for.",1451357982

The Central Intelligence Agency used American modern art - including the works of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko - as a weapon in the Cold War.

I am not defending Theranos or claiming they deserve any accolade or even sympathy. I am just pointing out that the romantic view that &quot;science triumphs&quot; is not, historically, supported by evidence on time scales shorter than a few decades. As most people&#x27;s careers -- scientists included -- are on that time scale, it is a bad idea to assume that &quot;science triumph&quot; for any specific person or company.<p>> How do you know this is true?<p>I&#x27;ve been following these issues for a while. To borrow Gary Taub&#x27;s analogy - the guides (&quot;eat this much or that much, mostly carbs, low fat, moderate protein&quot;) are similar to an advice about how to make a nightclub popular: &quot;get more people in&quot;. Yes, if you manage to do that consistently and with sustainable effort, then everything will be fine - yet the compliance rates are ridiculously low (as your link points out). But now we have the people, rather than doctors, to blame for non-compliant behavior, so the ADA and medical institution is not to blame.<p>However, there are studies (no time to look for refs right now, sorry), showing that people on low-carb, high-fat, medium protein (i.e. &quot;keto&quot; style) have a much, much higher compliance rate, and much better outcomes (in term of controlling blood sugar and reversing type 2) -- yet the recommended ADA (IIRC, can&#x27;t find it right now) is 60% carb, 30% protein, 10% fat. That&#x27;s high fat, mind you - not high protein.",1451357630

I will say software is good occupation while everything is blooming, but you can be more secure during the down time if you are an EE. Furthermore, you can train yourself to be a good software developer if you next to a computer and have internet access(of course you need dedication), but you cannot be a good EE without knowing how to operate a very expensive equipment(i.e PNA, MOCVD, etc). Disclaimer: I am a software developer with a background in EE",1451354670

We&#x27;re not talking about the Juarez Cartel here, we&#x27;re talking about 2 white people from Kansas with an <i>extremely</i> weak lead.  If the lead was accurate, which it wasn&#x27;t, it would&#x27;ve been 2 aging hippies, probably unarmed.  Maaaaaaybe somoene with a handgun stashed in the house.  Definitely not a paramilitary force of gangsters looking to get into a shootout.<p>The real reason for the SWAT raid is because SWAT raids are cool.  Look at the gear.  Look at the guns.  Looks like fun.  In fact, it looks like more fun than anything in the average policeman&#x27;s day job.  Ever seen a coder pick the more fun, cooler approach rather than the more appropriate, boring tool that gets the job done with a minimum of fuss?",1451354667

Forget about degree, job description etc. Also this is how the bidding system would work.<p>1. Let salaries be classified in tiers. 100K 110K 120K etc. These tiers are classified and published only after an year. \n2. Let companies bid for every employee based on how valuable the employee is. say a company bids for X at $120K p.a. \n2. Sort the bids in descending level. Each company will then have to pay their employee a salary that is at least as much as the lowest salary in that tier.",1451354609

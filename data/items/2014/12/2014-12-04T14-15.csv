8699485,comment,8698836,8698836,0,0,egsec,,,"How many photos are in the universe of possible photos? How long would it take for outsourcing the process to tag all photos so a script could then do the matching?<p>Is the whole point of this to encourage hackers to get working on this AI challenge of identifying similar photos?<p>Either they need to hire a lot of people to sit around making these sets or they have an automated way of creating these sets which can be reversed. It would seem to be an arms race where google is paying people, but attackers can have people break it at a cost less than creating them (takes less time to match them up then to find good photos, clean them up, tag them, etc.).<p>An attacker would also just target the database where this is all stored. With the text recaptcha, it would seem that they have all of these photos and scanned books and you have 8+ character strings of [a-zA-Z0-9], random guessing would not be good enough, so the attacker needed to solve the OCR problem.<p>However, given the option to select x of 9 images, if you assume that the extremes are less likely of 1/9, 2/9, 8/9, 9/9- then I can hope to get lucky picking 4 or 5 each time, the order does not matter. If you distribute the attack to get around rate limits, etc. - perhaps just picking the first through fifth images gives you a sufficiently high success rate.",1417705149

8699424,comment,8697772,8697772,0,0,tel,,,"There is no royal road to math.<p>There are instead, roughly, between 4 and 50 branches of mathematics which each start and &quot;end&quot; in different places with different goals and philosophies and styles.<p>What makes this all &quot;math&quot; is that almost inexplicably these branches tread the same ground over and over. Which is to say: learning one branch can dramatically improve your ability to understand another branch. Learning several builds your &quot;mathematical intuition&quot; all together.<p>In order to learn more math you will most likely want to choose one of these branches and study it intensely. You will <i>not</i> want to start from first principles to begin. Nobody does, it&#x27;s too complex. Instead, you should seek to understand some set of &quot;introductory core ideas&quot; from that branch.<p>In order to study <i>any</i> branch you will need to learn the language of mathematics: logic, theorems and proofs. Essentially, this is a language you can think in and speak. Without it, you will be incapable of carefully expressing the kind of sophisticated ideas math is founded upon.<p>Fortunately, programming <i>is</i> an application in logic. If you can program a computer you&#x27;re between 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the way to understanding mathematical logic well-enough to begin to understand mathematical argument. That said, you will not yet know enough. There are books which teach this language directly (Velleman&#x27;s How to Prove It, perhaps) and there is an entire field of <i>study</i> of this language. Usually, however, you just learn by doing. Certain branches are more amenable to this learning of the logical language than others.<p>One thing to note about the logical language that would be told to you by any teacher but is only mentioned in a few books is that it is not much like English in that you can just listen to or read something in the logical language and have it immediately form a cogent picture in your mind. Mathematical language is a language of action---you <i>MUST</i> complete proofs, often on your own, in order to have grasped what was being said. This doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t value in skimming a math book and reading the results without doing the proofs. Indeed, that&#x27;s often a great first pass through a book! But think of doing that like reading the Cliff&#x27;s Notes for a great work of literature. You might be able to talk about it a little bit, but you certainly haven&#x27;t understood the material.<p>One final note with respect to learning any branch—where you start is critical. Often, even the simplest reviews of the material of one branch of mathematics will assume &quot;basic, working knowledge&quot; of many other branches. This is done in order to accelerate learning for those who possess that working knowledge—it takes advantage of the frequent crossover properties from one branch of mathematics to another. Finding resources which do this minimally will be important to begin... but you will probably not succeed entirely. Sometimes, you just have to read a math book and walk away from it without being too much the wiser, but recognizing that there was some technique from another field you could learn to unlock a deeper understanding.<p>---<p>Some major fields of mathematics are:<p>1. Algebra. This is like and unlike what you may call algebra today. It is the study of how things are built and decomposed. Indeed, it notes that many &quot;things&quot; can be described entirely in terms of how they are built and decomposed. It is often a good place to begin for programmers as it espouses a way of thinking about the world not dissimilar to the way we model domains in while programming. Some books include <i>Algebra: Chapter 0</i> by Aluffi and <i>Algebra</i> by MacLane.<p>2. Combinatorics. This is the study of &quot;counting&quot;, but counting far more complex than anything meant by that word in normal usage. It is often a first field of study for teaching people how to read and speak proofs and theorems and therefore is well recommended. It is also where the subfield of graph theory (mostly) lies which makes it more readily accessible to programmers with an algorithms background. I can recommend West&#x27;s <i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>, but only with the caveat that it is incredibly dry and boring---you will get out of it what you put into practicing the proofs and nothing more.<p>3. Topology. This is the study of what it means for one thing to be &quot;near&quot; another. Similarly, it is the study of what it means to be &quot;smooth&quot;. It&#x27;s a somewhat more abstract topic than the others, but in modern mathematics it holds a privileged role as its theorems tend to have surprising and powerful consequences elsewhere in mathematics. I don&#x27;t know any good introductory material here---perhaps Munkres&#x27; <i>Topology</i>.<p>4. Calculus and Analysis. This is the study of &quot;smooth things&quot;. It is often the culminating point of American high school mathematics curricula because it has strong relationship with basic physics. Due to this interplay, it&#x27;s a remarkably well-studied field with applications throughout applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is also the first &quot;analyst&#x27;s&quot; field I&#x27;ve mentioned so far. Essentially, there are two broad styles of reasoning in mathematics, the &quot;algebraicist&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;analyst&#x27;s&quot;. Some people find that they love one much more than the other. The best intro book I know is Spivak&#x27;s <i>Calculus</i>.<p>5. Set Theory. This is, on its surface, the study of &quot;sets&quot; which are, often, the most basic mathematical structure from which all others arise. You should study it eventually at this level to improve your mathematical fluency---it&#x27;s a bit like learning colloquial English as compared to just formal English. More deeply, it is a historical account of the philosophical effort to figure out what the absolute basis of mathematics is---a study of foundations. To understand Set theory at this level is far more challenging, but instrumental for understanding some pieces of Logic. This can therefore be a very useful branch of study for the computer scientist investigating mathematics. I don&#x27;t know a good introductory book, unfortunately.<p>6. Number Theory. This is, unlike the others above excepting &quot;surface&quot; Set theory, a branch which arises from studying the properties of a single, extremely interesting mathematical object: the integers. Probably the most obvious feature of this field is the idea that numbers can be decomposed into &quot;atomic&quot; pieces called prime numbers. That idea is studied generally in algebra, but the properties of prime numbers escape many of the general techniques. I don&#x27;t know a good introductory book, unfortunately.<p>7. Measure Theory and Probability Theory. Measure theory is the study of the &quot;substance&quot; of things. It generalizes notions like length, weight, and volume letting you build and compare them in any circumstance. Furthermore, if you bound your measure, e.g. declare that &quot;all things in the universe, together, weigh exactly 1 unit&quot;, then you get probability theory---the basis of statistics and a form of logical reasoning in its own right. I don&#x27;t know a good introductory book, unfortunately.<p>8. Linear Algebra. A much more &quot;applied&quot; field than some of the others, but one that&#x27;s surprisingly deep. It studies the idea of &quot;simple&quot; relationships between &quot;spaces&quot;. These are tackled in general in (general) algebra, but linear algebra has vast application in the real world. It&#x27;s also the most direct place to study matrices which are vastly important algebraic tools. I don&#x27;t know a good introductory book, unfortunately.<p>9. Logic. A much more philosophical field at one end and an intensely algebraic field at the other. Logic establishes notions of &quot;reasoning&quot; and &quot;judgement&quot; and attempts to state which are &quot;valid&quot; for use as a mathematical language. Type Theory is closely related and is vital for the development of modern programming languages, so that might be an interesting connection. I don&#x27;t know a good introductory book, unfortunately.<p>---<p>Hopefully, some of the ideas above are interesting on their surface. Truly understanding whether one is interesting or not is necessarily an exercise in getting your feet a little wet, though: you will have to dive in just a bit. You should also try to understand your goals of learning mathematics---do you seek beauty, power, or application? Different branches will be appealing based on your goals.<p>Anticipate studying mathematics forever. All of humankind together appears to be on the path of studying it forever---you personally will never see its end. What this means is that you must either decide to make it a hobby, a profession, or to consciously leave some (many) doors unopened. Mathematics is a universal roach motel for the curious.<p>But all that said, mathematics is the most beautiful human discovery. It probably always will be. It permeates our world such that the skills learned studying mathematics will eke out and provide value in any logical concern you undertake.<p>Good luck.",1417704470

8699420,comment,8698074,8698896,0,0,ICWiener,,,"I forgot about lenses, thanks.<p>About non-locality of macros vs. functions:<p>Macros, being functions, provide this kind of assurance, too at the syntax tree level: you only operate on the local, current subtree.
They can indeed modify the meaning of symbols in that subtree, but I think you are taking things to the extreme. Off course, an arbitrarly nasty macro &quot;far up in the tree&quot; (how deep are the typical functions, anyway?) could do horrible things. Also, we must ban sugar because if someone eats too much sugar, that someone dies.<p>However, the average usage is more subtle.
For example, when you DEFUN a function, you are registering a function in your current environment (side-effects) through a macro, which does not dramatically change the semantics of the body of the function, compared to, say, an anonymous LAMBDA (the only change is, I think, the ability to RETURN-FROM a named function).<p>CL is not a functional language: you can loop over lists or across vectors, you can setf special variables and mutate strings. You have static and dynamic non-local exits (return, throw/catch, signal) and  even goto&#x27;s (tagbody). That does not mean that you should use them all and go against best practices and common sense.
Just because a feature could be misused does not make it irrelevant.<p>For the record, I have nothing against functional languages (or any other language, really (except of course PHP ;-)). It just seem unfair to attack macros. They should be avoided whenever possible, but they have some uses: C (macros), C++ (templates), <i>and even Haskell and Scala</i> try to have them:<p><a href=""http://scalamacros.org/usecases/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalamacros.org/usecases/index.html</a><p><a href=""https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.6.1/docs/html/users_guide/template-haskell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.6.1/docs/html/users_gui...</a><p><a href=""http://neilmitchell.blogspot.fr/2007/01/does-haskell-need-macros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neilmitchell.blogspot.fr/2007/01/does-haskell-need-ma...</a><p>Finally: macros are <i>not</i> a hack used to fix a supposedly missing feature of the language (e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t need macros because I have lazy evaluation&quot;, etc.).

We pick the axioms and the rules, if they&#x27;re interesting and reasonably consistent, it&#x27;s mathematics.<p>The first principle of <i>learning</i> mathematics is that the notation describing idea `M{n}` depends on an understanding of some notation describing idea `M{n-1}. That&#x27;s why there is some sense in which &quot;first principles&quot; of mathematics makes sense. In the end, learning mathematics is a long haul - the academically elite of the world normally spend twelve years just getting to the point of completing a first calculus course before heading off to university.<p>Of course, there isn&#x27;t really an explicit ordering to the notation. This despite our ordering of the school-boy educational system.  Out in the adult world, mathematicians, engineers, scientists, etc. just grab whatever notation is convenient for thinking about the problem they are trying to solve. Thus, it is common for separate domains to have wildly different underlying abstractions for a common mathematical concept: ie. two problems which are reducible to each other by manipulating notation using replacement.<p>What this means is that there&#x27;s no meaningful reason to derive the domain specific language [notation] of cryptography and antenna design simultaneously from Peano arithmetic...sure there&#x27;s a formalism, but it&#x27;s a Turing tarpit equivalent to building Facebook&#x27;s infrastructure in Brainfuck. Starting from first principles is a task for mathematicians of Russel&#x27;s and Whitehead&#x27;s calibers. For a novice, it constitutes a rookie mistake; keeping in mind that the problem Gödel found with <i>Principia Mathematica</i> is foundational to computer science.<p>The philosopher CS Pierce&#x27;s criticism of Descartes <i>Meditations</i> can be elevator pitched as: enquiry begins where and when we have the doubt, not later after we have travelled to some starting point. The base case for extending our knowledge is our current knowledge; creating better working conditions and unlearning poor habits of mind are part of the task.<p>If the enquiry grows out of knowledge in computing, it is impossible to start anywhere but from computing. Getting to the &quot;No! I want to start over here!&quot; place is part of the enquiry and a sham exercise.<p>All of which is to preface two suggestions:<p>+ Knuth&#x27;s <i>Art of Computer Programming</i> presents a lot of mathematics in a context relevant to people with an interest in computing. Volume I starts off with mathematics, Volume II is all about numbers, Volumes III and IV are loaded with geometry and the algebraic equivalents of things we think about geometrically.<p>+ Iverson&#x27;s <i>Math for the Layman</i> and other works are useful for introducing the importance of notation and tying it to computing. [Disclaimer: I&#x27;m currently in love with J, and posting the following link was where I started this comment]. <a href=""http://www.cs.trinity.edu/About/The_Courses/cs301/math-for-the-layman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.trinity.edu/About/The_Courses/cs301/math-for-t...</a><p>+ Because notions of computability are implicit in mathematics, automata theory is another vector for linking knowledge of computing to an increased understanding of mathematics.<p>Good luck.",1417703420

you work for a bank or investment house like Goldamn.  You know stochastic calculus very well, you know finite differencing like the back of your hand.  You&#x27;ll know every way to look at a derivative product.  You can program in matlab.  You create the next big thing like CDO&#x27;s or CDS&#x27;s<p>If you love math, this is where you want to be.<p>2) Quants who trade
You work at a hedge fund. You can program in python with scikit or use R.  You don&#x27;t know calculus maybe as well as a pricing quant but you  know some area of the market much much better.  You  know stats like its your mother tongue.<p>3) Risk quant/programmer.  You do modelling all day for a trader or risk manager.  You can take a portfolio and model any feature that someone ask for. Var, beta, greeks, you  can spit them out quickly.  You know C++, excel and R.  You might have been an engineer in a former life.<p>This is often considered the low position in the quant hierarchy.  This is how some programmers break into the industry.<p>4) I lied there is actually special category 4).  This is the professors of quants.  You sit around all day and think about the next big equation, or how to model derivatives better than black scholes.  If you are one of these people chances are your name is known in the industry:)<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> someone asked if you can do these without a math degree.  The short answer is probably not.  YOu&#x27;ll need a math, engineering, or physics degree, unless you really are driven to learn hte math yourself.<p>A comp sci degree might work but you would be the exception and you&#x27;d be fighting up hill.  Ask your self honestly, how many branches of mathematics have you self taught yourself and you&#x27;ll get your answer.  For most the answer is none, for a select few the answer is yes.<p>Someone asked about brain teasers.  They do get asked, you have to deal with it, whining in an interview that this type of question gives no useful hiring indicator won&#x27;t get you hired.  I don&#x27;t ask them but they are common:(<p>We throw around brain teasers at work during the day trying to stump each other.  I guess some of it is trying to look smart.  Some of it is that we just really like to dissect any problem and figure it out.<p>I think the biggest reason for asking brain teasers is that at a hedge fund there are no rules for how to make money, excluding legal.  They want people who can think outside the box.  it turns out that its really tough to test for &quot;can the candidate think outside the box&quot;?<p>Trading is a higher stress job than most other math or programming jobs, what we are trying to see is not only are you smart, but can you think on your feet and not get stressed out, because if an interview stresses you out, whats going to happens when a $50,000,000 position that should be going up starts to go down.<p>Are you going to complain that the model says it should go up and the market isn&#x27;t being fair, or are you going to accept what&#x27;s happening and get back to work?  You&#x27;d be surprised at the number of people who chose option 1.<p>I ask a bunch of questions that some people feel are brain teasers.  In between questions I&#x27;l throw out what&#x27;s the square root of 225 to see how the candidate reacts.  Good traders seem to be exceptional at mental math, with very, very few exceptions.<p>I&#x27;ll also ask alot of probability questions.  Get ready to know what your expected payoff is if you gamble on dice games, its basically what you do every minute of the day when trading:)<p>Now if you are a programmer, how do you get into the industry?  
You need to know stats, machine learning, and programming, really well.<p>And I don&#x27;t mean know machine learning, like &quot;I tool an nlp library and stiched it together to do sentiment analysis  on a corpus of text&quot;.  I will ask what algorithms the underlying library used.  You used SVM, great talk to me about your kernel selection methods.  I want to know that you understand the math, and more importantly the assumptions and limitations of the library you are using.<p>The reason is that when you trade on a model that is based on your machine learning, I want to know that you know when it breaks.  Finance is an industry that loves to model but has crashes that are predicted to happen 1 in 1000 year events happen every 10 years.<p>I love helping programmers who want to become quants get into the industry.

That&#x27;s a story right there. Did you ever get caught?<p>As for rewards in virtual games... it&#x27;s just a lot lower priority I guess, as it&#x27;s all virtual. There&#x27;s no direct loss to the company if someone is able to dupe items, unless it&#x27;s really widespread, but in that case it&#x27;s very noticeable quick (system wide deflation, fewer boss runs / grinding, rapidly rising item counts). It upsets the game balance and affects enjoyability (which indirectly affects subscriptions and thereby company profits), but it&#x27;s not direct money out of the company&#x27;s pockets (unless it&#x27;s a shitty game where you can directly buy items with real money. In that case it can dampen revenues fairly quickly).<p>> flags should be set to trigger notifications of unusual activity in order to mitigate damage from exploitation.<p>I was an admin for a while and had access to every single chat log. It&#x27;s pretty scary how privacy in virtual worlds doesn&#x27;t at all exist, nor is there any debate about it that I know of. I&#x27;m sure companies like facebook or WoW have restrictions and various policies in place, but in a lot of games an admin will be able to simply read your chat. I frequently had to look into reports of things like racial slurs in private chats to warn or ban users (and yes, people indeed fake-reported other users they hated, so I always had to check the logs for evidence), and just scrolling through the convos you&#x27;d scroll past the craziest private things. In my early teens a decade ago now I couldn&#x27;t help but read some of them. (morally pretty embarrassing to say). Anyway, as to the relevance of all this, needless to say every.single.time an exploit was found, you&#x27;d have users telling their friends in private chat IN game. You could search the logs for &#x27;admin&#x27; or &#x27;secret&#x27; or &#x27;exploit&#x27; and you&#x27;d find messages like this &#x27;Dude, keep this a secret cause admins will find out, but I just found a money duping exploit&#x27;. Anyway no admin ever did searches like this in practice, but it was pretty easy to build a flagging system. We eventually did build a proper flagging panel with charts of total credits in the game, or total unique boss items, or total XP earned. There&#x27;d trends for the time of the day in the US/Europe mostly, and trends for the day of the week (monday low, saturday high), and you could easily see deviations from that with exploits. In short, everyone always tells their friends, and not out-of-game either, and they almost always go full retard and become insanely wealthy in the span of days. Also, when veteran players complain of another player hacking, it almost always ends up being true after tons of denial. And it usually takes long to fix because almost half of the time the hacking player is a veteran player who is respected, trusted, well-connected and at times in partnership with admins who play themselves. Man online games are awesome, it&#x27;s like the bold and the beautiful sometimes haha. Haven&#x27;t played any in years though, wish I had the time I did as a teen!

(<a href=""http://deathbycaptcha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deathbycaptcha.com</a>). What nocaptcha does is only show that captcha (which is already defeated), to a certain subset of the users who haven&#x27;t been deemed trustworthy. So, the big bot builders will take a day or two and beat the system, and we&#x27;re right back to where we started.<p>Honeypots, however, are brutal - especially if you throw a couple in there. When building a bot you build it for efficiency. If your site does anything abnormal (whether it&#x27;s &#x27;what&#x27;s n+n?&#x27; or &#x27;what popular figure comes through your chimney in December?&#x27;) a bot is hopeless.<p>That being said, however, a bot is only hopeless so long as a solution isn&#x27;t implemented widely enough to be worth breaking through for spammers. If, for example, Wordpress came up with 1000 questions like that, someone somewhere would come up with and sell 1000 solutions.<p>In some sense it may be the case that Google is one of the worst companies to create a a simple anti-spam API. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something they could do that would be more effective than this, but this won&#x27;t really move the needle.",1417702309

As a former mathematician when I see &#x27;first principles&#x27; I think of axiomatic approaches to mathematics and the study of subjects like analysis, algebra and geometry from those first principles. I suspect however that what you want is good ground in the foundations of mathematics necessary to understand common applications of mathematics, which is quite different.<p>It is also a difficult question to answer without some context of your current mathematical understanding. Do you know any calculus? Any linear algebra? If you don&#x27;t, those would be good places to start as they underpin many areas with applications of mathematics. Bear in mind too that Mathematics is a huge subject in that even if you take to it naturally, you&#x27;re not going to acquire a breadth and level of understanding without a fair amount of study. Looking back I probably put a lot of hours in my youth into really understanding linear algebra fully for example to the level that I could teach it at a high-ranking university, and that was with the help of people whom I could pester with my questions and the incentive of exams to take.<p>The other approach is to look at the areas you want to understand and then work out what topics you need to study to fully understand them. Cryptography is worlds away from electromagnetism for example. Looking at cryptography, are you interested in public key cryptography or symmetric key cryptography? If the former, then you need to start learning number theory and if the latter, knowing some statistics is probably more relevant.",1417701945

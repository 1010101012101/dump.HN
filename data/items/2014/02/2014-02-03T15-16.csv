Beginners are learning code/a new language for a reason. Usually that reason is to get stuff done. They don&#x27;t need to know how the insides of these frameworks work to do that.<p>As these beginners progress, as they start getting curious or need, for example, to know why getting your ORM to count the records in the database is faster than getting your ORM to pull all the records and counting the number of records in the array, this is when these beginners need to think about re-inventing the wheel.<p>I&#x27;m a firm believer in &#x27;you should re-invent the wheel once and once only&#x27;, but never ever ever use the wheel you just built. That way you should understand what a framework or any lower layer of abstraction is doing for you. Whomever wrote the framework will also most likely have a better solution that has tested more edge cases than you did, you have less code to maintain (yay less teechnical debt!) which is why you never use your own wheel. Re-invent the wheel so you have a better understanding but that&#x27;s it.<p>If we keep expecting beginners to understand every level of abstraction that we have created for them they&#x27;d be writing a web-server in assembler, not solving any of the problems they have, become disinterested and giving up or never ever ever shipping any of their code ever.",1391442988

During the Season of Retreat when all the monks returned to the monastery, two novices had to do all the cooking and wash the dishes for sometimes well over one hundred monks. There was no soap. We had only ashes, rice husks, and coconut husks, and that was all. Cleaning such a high stack of bowls was a chore, especially during the winter when the water was freezing cold. Then you had to heat up a big pot of water before you could do any scrubbing. Nowadays one stands in a kitchen equipped with liquid soap, special scrubpads, and even running hot water which makes it all the more agreeable. It is easier to enjoy washing the dishes now. Anyone can wash them in a hurry, then sit down and enjoy a cup of tea afterwards. I can see a machine for washing clothes, although I wash my own things out by hand, but a dishwashing machine is going just a little too far! While washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes, which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes. At first glance, that might seem a little silly:<p>Why put so much stress on a simple thing? But that&#x27;s precisely the point. The fact that I am standing there and washing these bowls is a following my breath, conscious of my presence, and conscious of my thoughts and actions. There&#x27;s no way I can be tossed around mindlessly like a bottle slapped here and there on the waves.</i><p><a href=""http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/G%20-%20TNH/TNH/From%20The%20Miracle%20of%20Mindfulness/Teaching.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/G%20-%20TNH/TNH/Fro...</a>",1391442770

Indisputably, Lisp is remarkable and holds a special place in the pantheon of programming languages.  Every argument in it&#x27;s favor makes sense, a lot of sense.  Reading these arguments in favor of Lisp is not like reading a blog touting the benefits of Javascript where even the positive points don&#x27;t really sound so positive.  The arguments made for Lisp are persuasive.<p>Lisp is different.  It&#x27;s really quite unique; it has an elegant simplicity underlying its implementation and a deep connection to the foundations of computation.  Think of this, Gregor Kiczales&#x27;s book Art of the Metaobject Protocol was published 23 years ago!  I learned to program in Lisp 40 years ago.  What other languages did I use back in those days?  Assembly language (IBM 360, CDC 6600, IBM 1130, etc), PL/1, Fortran, APL, COBOL.  Nobody, argues today that we should be trying out PL/1 or we should give COBOL a try.  (Are there any projects on Github using these languages from our hazy, distant past?)  Lisp&#x27;s beauty and power have kept it alive and vital all these years.  But, there&#x27;s something wrong with this story.<p>If Lisp is really so great, why hasn&#x27;t it triumphed? I use Lisp all the time: my editor needs it during periodic tune ups.  However, I can&#x27;t think of when I&#x27;ve reached for it first when I&#x27;ve had a choice.  Python is just easier to get things done in.  If my programs don&#x27;t run fast enough I don&#x27;t think of Lisp, I think of C or C++.  Haskell is where it&#x27;s at as far as programming language research goes, not Lisp.<p>The important observation is that it&#x27;s not just me.  Lisp has had time to prove itself.  It made it to the finals, and it deserves the lifetime achievement award.  We can honor it&#x27;s beauty, it&#x27;s longevity, it&#x27;s power, and even it&#x27;s fantastic reincarnations (Clojure), but this isn&#x27;t enough.

These are targets for more dedicated mappers to examine, on foot, or with aerial imagery to improve. Hardcore mappers mainly here, large tasks, large time.<p>3. Mapping workshops are held in a small town to blitz a new development, fill holes and cover an entire area all at once. Twenty participants can do a large area with transport and the right equipment.<p>4. web based task manager is set up to allocate squares of land for people to trace from, dozens of people can take a small square and trace over the top. Local knowledge can then quickly add in names and landmarks.<p>So you can see that there are a number of different crowd-sourced labour approaches which would replicate what an import would do, but that by crowdsourcing you actually increase the number of people in that labour pool. An import does not help increase the number of contributors.<p>Now, this is more scalable in developed countries where there are more people with time to donate (same applies to any unpaid crowdsourced project), and so that example no. 1 in developing countries of an organic community keeping things up to date wouldn&#x27;t really happen.  However it&#x27;s quite widespread in the developing world that there are no proprietary datasets of any decent quality. Imports could not even be considered in these places.",1391442258

By extracting every last ounce of creative potential from a box that does 3 things. &quot;Surrendering to the machine,&quot; if you will.<p>The unlimited potential of modern music software will cripple you, and the first step in this is the impossible choice of which software to use. It gets worse from there on out.<p>If you are already a musician then it makes sense to seek out the powerful tools which will allow you to implement your already fully-formed musical ideas. However, if you want to just create &quot;electronic music,&quot; the way to do this is by trial and error, and extensive practice with <i>one tool,</i> which tool is not important.<p>Skrillex, Basic Channel etc did not come up with their distinctive sound palettes by imagining them in advance and then seeking out the &quot;best&quot; tools to implement them. They did it by turning all of the knobs on the 2 or 3 tools they had, plugging them all into each other backwards and upside down until a sound came out that they liked.<p>If you want to make &quot;electronic music,&quot; that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done. However hard you try and do it deliberately, you will eventually come back to letting the machine play its proper part.<p>The other universal truth is that when you discover how your favourite producer did something that sounds incredibly complex to you, it have been via an incredibly simple technique that they didn&#x27;t really understand. &quot;I just plugged the output back into the input, turned it up to 11 and that sound came out.&quot; They were able to discover this because they weren&#x27;t worrying about tutorials and decisions, they were too busy turning it up to 11.<p>(Note that this is what guitar/piano/etc musicians have been doing for centuries, because they had no choice. How much great music do you think beethoven would have written if he&#x27;d had to choose from 10,000 pianos? Would the music that he did write be better or worse?)<p>EDIT: so, practical advice: try some tools. As soon as you find a small set of tools which you find intuitive, stop looking for more. Use the tools intensively until you have pretty much exhausted them, or got really bored. By then you should be pretty accomplished, so the search for new tools will no longer be painful and limiting, but fun and empowering.<p>If you&#x27;re brave, choose a software package at random. Or go to your local pawn shop, buy the first piece of music gear that catches your eye, and force yourself to write 10 tracks with it and only it, no matter how pitiful it might be.",1391442124

If you consider the age they were drafted, it makes perfect sense because back then all inventions were physical, and one could figure out things just by looking at it.<p>For instance, until the Wright brothers built their flier, controlled flight was deemed impossible after decades of failed and fatal attempts. But anyone who simply saw the mechanism they rigged could re-implement it for themselves! The decades of work before it make it amply clear it was not obvious [1].<p>Also it&#x27;s not just the obviousness of the invention that&#x27;s at play, it&#x27;s the obviousness of the problem. The solution may be trivial, but the problem may not even be encountered without exploring new boundaries (think Apple and touchscreens). Sometimes the problem is right there in front of everybody&#x27;s eyes and yet nobody notices it (think Flash of Insight).<p>In addition, you would be surprised by how many incredibly complex problems are solved by &quot;trivial&quot; solutions which nonetheless take years of effort to arrive at. One example I am aware of is digital and wireless communications methods: most of those patents appear trivial. But the mathematics that goes into proving that they actually work and work well span pages.<p>However, if you change the standard to that of non-triviality, it will reduce the incentives for improvement, and proportionally, the rate of innovation, in areas where copying would be trivial. This is not hypothetical [3].<p>If you think we don&#x27;t need incentives for innovation in the &quot;trivial&quot; areas of technology, why did we need Apple to show us how to do touchscreen UIs right when companies like Nokia had developed touchscreen smartphones decades before?<p>Changing to a standard of triviality will instead focus efforts on areas where inventions <i>cannot</i> be reverse-engineered easily, and those already don&#x27;t need patent protection because trade secret is enough for those (again, see [3]). Think of Google&#x27;s search algorithms and distributed systems infrastructure. How is hoarding of valuable technology behind the walls of data centers conducive to diffusion of knowledge and the progress of &quot;useful arts&quot;?<p>1. Before you say &quot;and look how it held up the aviation industry!&quot;, I encourage you to read this paper [2] that busts that myth.<p>2. <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2355673"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2355673</a><p>3. <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930243</a> - paper studying historical rates of innovation in countries with and without patents.

(There are literally comments in the code like &quot;oh, so that&#x27;s what an array is&quot;.) I originally planned to use jplayer [2] for the audio because I believed it had very good cross platform support. But after I dug down deeper (and wasted quite a bit of time), I discovered that for what I actually wanted to do (control multiple audio streams from the same set of controls), jplayer had poor cross-platform support: for example, on iOS every audio stream has to be started by a user action, so it&#x27;s not possible to play multiple streams by tapping once. There were a number of problems like this. The issue was, because I was so much of a novice, I didn&#x27;t know how to assess jplayer&#x27;s limitations to the degree that a more experienced developer would have before choosing to use it.<p>Similarly, I used jQuery Mobile [3] to create mobile-friendly sliders for audio volume control, but then spent a long time working out to disable all the other things jQuery Mobile does by default.<p>I ended up using raw HTML5 audio elements, and I kind of wish that I&#x27;d implemented the sliders and the rest of the controls in vanilla js rather than jQuery and jQuery Mobile. I would have learned more. As it is, my understanding of what jQuery actually offers is hazy because I&#x27;m unsure about how much I could have done without it.<p>My takeaway is that until you know the basics of a language, you can&#x27;t tell what tools you need or the limitations the tools you chose will impose on you. I think it&#x27;s far better for beginners to start using the absolute minimum set of tools (in my case, hand-coded HTML, CSS and JS) and then add more complex tools when one encounters a problem one can&#x27;t solve with what one already has, or to optimize something one already knows how to do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://asoftmurmur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asoftmurmur.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jplayer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jplayer.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://jquerymobile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jquerymobile.com/</a>",1391441457

As a general principal, this is not ridiculous, e.g. a female boxer will perform worse than a male boxer, even given the same height and weight.  You personally might believe that a resume so perfectly captures the qualities of a person, that the person&#x27;s gender is no longer relevant once you have seen the rest of the resume.  But that is just your opinion.<p>So the professors are discriminating against women, but not for its own sake, but because they believe that statistically, even given the same resume, the woman would on average perform worse.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_discrimination_%28economics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_discrimination_%28e...</a><p>This kind of discrimination does not actually make women on average worse off, in the sense that it only penalizes them for their actual inferior performance, not for being women per se.<p>On the legality, I don&#x27;t know if it is legal or not.

First of all author stated that <i>Unfortunately, many with computer science degrees have a weak understanding of the concept—let alone those without any training on it.</i> but the explanation he gave is actually identical to those that are given in colleges and this is why people have weak understanding of NP problems.<p>He then lists three most common examples of NP problems that are not even as close to the real problems as he thinks they are.<p><i>This is why the P versus NP problem is so interesting to people. If anyone were to solve it, it would potentially make very difficult problems very easy.</i> and here is where he missed the point completely. This is simply not true - if for example there is polynomial time algorithm solving NP problem then P vs. NP is solved but if this algorithm is lower bounded by, I don&#x27;t know, n^(10^80) it&#x27;s not so easy for computers either. It is &#x27;useless&#x27; from real software point of view.<p>The most profound effect of proving that P=NP is that the ability to check any answer&#x27;s correctness &#x27;fast&#x27; (in polynomial time) is sufficient to being able to solve that problem in polynomial time.

They&#x27;re just not all that much faster and certainly not polynomial-time, and hence they don&#x27;t resolve P vs NP.

The question of P vs NP is not the question of whether there are any genuinely difficult problems to solve, if by genuinely difficult we mean no poly-time solution.

7170917,comment,7170670,7170670,2,0,danso,,,"Yeah, while I support the Learn to Code movement, it is dismaying to see so much of it focused on frameworks, i.e. basically Ruby on Rails. It&#x27;s a simple play for monetary desire, I know, so to tell a novice, &quot;Well, if you get a strong understanding of Ruby and programming in general, learning Rails is pretty straightforward&quot;...is just going to confuse and frustrate them because they&#x27;ve heard about how it&#x27;s <i>Rails</i> that brings in the money, so why not skip the middleman (Ruby)?<p>Web frameworks consist of a lot of things besides pure programming. And these beginners barely understand programming...hell, they barely understand basic file systems that don&#x27;t involve folder icons. And so all of this stuff...databases, MVC design, object-oriented concepts, dev ops, debugging...oh, and the entire world of front-end design...is thrown at them in such a way that there is no way they can decouple what are mostly orthogonal concepts.<p>It&#x27;d be fine if these beginners couldn&#x27;t write a optimized SQL query in place of ActiveRecord...that&#x27;d be <i>perfectly fine</i> to work with. But I&#x27;m talking about a much deeper level of confusion. I once worked with a Rails self-learner and he wanted to throw up a single web page, with a sortable table that had a trivial number of rows (i.e. the data could all fit on one page without being cumbersome)...he could not, for the life of him, figure out how to do that in such a way that didn&#x27;t involve creating a new Rails project and deploying it to Heroku.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m against teaching frameworks...it&#x27;s just that for beginners, it seems like a very convoluted way to do so, and one that could be very unproductive in the end.",1391439698

3271208,comment,3265601,3267742,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Your point about being a loser is exactly the kind of thing that hurts people more than helps them. Don't get me wrong, I get your point and the way you put it really makes sense. Yes, I'm sure failing can lead to depression and I have no doubt that it happens. But consider this.<p>Very often the very thing that creates a ""loser"" is not a personal failing but actually a symptom of depression. People will fly off the handle on me for not citing a study but it's the best I've got right now. I'll take my own case. From birth I was as happy and normal as anyone. Smart as anything, lots of success, and so on. Suddenly depression comes out of nowhere. The symptoms of depression brought me to a point where I could no longer work, study, or do anything really. It also led me to self medicate and become an addict. That's the point where my situation fed my depression and made it worse much like you describe.<p>Stories like this are very common from the depressed. Everyone fails at some point but that failure doesn't always lead to depression. People just pick up the pieces and move on.<p>So while what you say could likely be true for some, it's most likely not true for most NAND even if it is, that line of thought prevents people from seeking the help they need soon enough if at all. They come to think that they are flawed and weak which then feeds the depression beast and on top of it they believe that they can somehow snap themselves out of it and become ""strong"" by sheer will power.<p>Your comment also implies that there's no difference between situational depression and other forms of the disease. You could also read it as saying depression is the same as being really really sad. I know you didn't mean it that way and I can't blame you for it. Honestly, people who haven't been there will have thoughts like these. That's why I always argue for more education and it's why the professionals keep shoving the ""it's a disease"" line down our throats. Because people who don't have the experience are inadvertently doing harm to those who need help.<p>And you're right, I might have been just a touch sensitive. It's not that I take it personally. It's just that having seen myself and others in that situation I know that they'd cringe for fear that some poor soul will take it to heart and actually try to will their way out of it instead of seeking help.",1322074766

     Court jails Pirate Bay founders
</code></pre>
apparently existing copyright law, in this case in Sweden, and routine legal action have been sufficient actually to put in jail all of the founders of Pirate Bay not 'on the lam"".  And, Pirate Bay didn't actually host any movies or recorded music but just had links to Torrent sources.<p>So, it sounds to me like existing copyright law is close to strong enough for the purposes of the MPAA/RIAA.<p>Actually, being able actually to lock up the Pirate Bay founders sounds to me like the current copyright law is already too strong, that is, too much weakening of freedom of the press and freedom of speech:  To see this, an analogy would be to lock up authors of crime and spy novels because they provide information that a criminal might use.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Dame Agatha Christie, and Tom Clancy did nothing violent but did provide information that might let others be violent; Pirate Bay sent no movies or music but did provide information that would let others receive such.  Heck, it sounds like with the position of the MPAA/RIAA we should also lock up authors of books on physics, chemistry, and engineering because such books can be used to build a wide range of weapons.<p>Gee, let's see:  Via Google we should be able to find an effective recipe for classic gun powder.  One of the key ingredients is saltpeter, that is, potassium nitrate (KNO3).  Hmm ....  There it is:  Can buy it 5 pounds at a time at Amazon.  Now, as I recall, all we need is some sulfur and charcoal.  So, by the standards of the MPAA/RIAA, we should lock up the founders of Google and Amazon?<p>My father used to buy ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) in small pellets in 100 pound bags.  He used it as a lawn fertilizer, and the results were dramatic:  The grass turned dark green, got dense, and jumped; we had to mow the grass about every other day; Mom was proud to have the greenest lawn in the neighborhood!  Ammonium nitrate was readily available if only because a few miles into the country people were growing cotton, and NH4NO3 did similar things for cotton.  But, as we should expect from all that nitrogen, NH4NO3 can be one heck of an explosive.  Just ask some of the people in Galveston, TX!  And apparently if mix NH4NO3 with fuel oil, then can pull down some buildings.  So, by the standards of the MPAA/RIAA we should lock up the founders of lawn and garden stores and heating oil suppliers?<p>I'm against stealing copies of movies, recorded music, etc., but I'm not for shooting the Internet in the gut, and shooting the Internet in the gut IS what the MPAA/RIAA with SOPA would do.  Protection of books and music have had to evolve with technology from the printing press, music recording, radio, TV, tape recorders, CD and DVD burners, VCRs, set-top boxes, Blockbuster, Netflix, etc. and, net, will have to continue to evolve.<p>Net, I don't condone improper use, don't want to hurt the Internet, don't have easy answers for all of the concerns of the MPAA/RIAA, but wish them well; a reasonable solution should be possible without shooting the Internet in the gut.  If not, then I'm sorry MPAA/RIAA:  The Internet, PDF files, etc. have seriously hurt publishing on paper, but those publishers didn't shoot the Internet in the gut; your business model might have to evolve.<p>Efforts of the MPAA/RIAA to shoot the Internet in the gut did and will encounter a ""buzz saw"".",1322073531

That is, while the Nook has something like 1 gb of internal storage for books, about 75% is reserved for content you have to purchase through Barnes & Noble. That leaves about 230 mb for your own files. (The Nook does feature expandable storage via microSD, but these don't get placed into your ""Library"" on the device in the same way files on the internal storage do). I'm sure many of these same concerns apply to the Kindle. (And more, since Nook books are EPUB format, while Kindle seems to use a variety of formats, including some proprietary formats & DRM).<p>I really like the convenience of an e-reader, and the e-ink screen really is fantastic, but so far I've only loaded files from Project Gutenberg and some e-books from Manning (who provides free pdf and sometimes EPUB format e-books when you buy the hardcopy). I'm already bumping up against the (artificial) 230 mb-or-so limit for books <i>not</i> purchased directly from B&N.<p>I'd be more open to buying e-books from B&N if I wasn't afraid of a scenario similar to what's described in the article. As far as I can tell, B&N ships their Nook books with DRM, what guarantees do I have that I can still read those books if B&N goes under, or my account gets screwed up in some mix-up?<p>Edit:
I must have phrased something in a confusing way. The Nook allows you to load 3rd party, non-DRM'd EPUB and PDF's (although as I mentioned, you only get about a quarter of the device's internal storage to use for 3rd-party content).

I tell my design and product team that as the core feature set grows, more development time and design effort must be invested in keeping the software simple to use. Similar to the way your test suite must grow more powerful to cope with increasing code complexity. There's probably a cool metaphor like technical debt lurking around here somewhere.<p>As an example, think of Facebook - one of their ideas was to simplify the standard classes & permissions system down to concept everyone would understand and use: Friends. Friends is basically permissions without the classes, wrapped around a familiar mental model. This was very successful, but over time users demanded the ability to grant different permissions to different users. For example, family vs. applications or close friends vs. co-workers.<p>So Facebook re-introduced the concept of classes to their permissions systems. They called them lists. And they ran into the same problem that has bedeviled permissions systems from the dawn of Unix. It's a PITA to understand and manage the additional complexity.<p>So Facebook invested a lot of time in simplifying class management. Namely, they used social signals, some basic heuristics (everyone has a class called ""applications"" and another called ""family"") and probably some other information to auto-assign friends to classes for you.<p>While the new, class-aware permissions system is more complex than what Facebook started with, it's simple enough that users seem to be adopting it just fine.<p>This is just one example, but this sequence is repeated everywhere good software is made. And it's pretty easy to understand: stop adding features when they add too much UI complexity for your target audience to successfully use.

If Microsoft attempted to EEE HTML, Javascript, and CSS with IE5+, it's failed miserably, since the usage of both Chrome and Firefox continues to rise while IE stagnates or declines. You only have to follow the development of IE10 to realize the company knows it needs to play nicely with these technologies, whether it wants to or not. 
Also, .NET was a response to Java, and while Silverlight and WPF were attempts to develop competing technologies to Flash and HTML/Javascript/CSS that also seems to have failed, since HTML and JS are key elements of the Metro UI for Windows 8.
In addition, Microsoft's actions against Android, while despicable, are hardly different than what most other tech companies are doing, so it's best to focus on the broken patent system. Finally, C# (and CLI) is a standard owned by the ECMA, so Microsoft can't sue you if you write a compiler and library from scratch.",1322071647

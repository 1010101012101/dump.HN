But nothing about the rhetoric coming out of the FCC is saying that they are looking at changing the entire payment model of the Internet. (Also of note is that changing something this fundamental does risk breaking the system in order to fix it on the other side.)<p>If you look at the deliberation involved in the rollout of IPv6 and compare to this, which is about as fundamental on the business side, there&#x27;s no comparison. The FCC is moving in a haphazard fashion without addressing what a fundamental change this is.<p>It is indeed interesting to wonder how the incentives change if the funds ISPs get from service providers (SPs) overshadow the fees from consumers. In an unregulated market, that would possibly lead ISPs to acquire those SPs (a la Comcast-NBC) and make it harder to access content not owned by the ISP. So we could circle back to an AOL-like environment. The FCC is so far pretending that this is not possible.<p>Also note that under your scenario it&#x27;s possible that the Netflix business would not be possible, because the ISPs would make the connection fees high enough to destroy the business model, instead shunting their customers onto their proprietary platforms. In fact, any time an SP becomes popular, it would be shareholder-friendly for the ISP to make a bad clone of that SP and then make connection fees to the original unbearably high. The FCC is again ignoring this likely outcome.<p>To say nothing of the likelihood that fewer SPs will get started in the first place. Given free reign, why wouldn&#x27;t large ISPs charge a baseline connection fee for every SP? And why would we expect that fee to accessible to businesses without institutional funding? It would be &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; for e.g. Comcast to charge $10k annually for access to it&#x27;s tens of millions of subscribers. It would be &quot;commercially reasonable&quot; for AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. to do the same. Don&#x27;t forget that any web operator that wants to be accessible nationally/globally (if other countries follow suit) will need to pay that connection fee many times. The FCC is silent on this issue.<p>The point is there&#x27;s a lot here that&#x27;s not being addressed by the FCC.",1400100234

Which makes it a competition to see who can provide the best service vs price (or whatever choices you&#x27;re basing your decision on).<p>If you only have access to the internet through your cable lines or phone lines, having the entities that control those finite resources legally able to charge more for different types of content over their lines or content from different locations, etc. is a pretty huge deal.<p>Even when you use some &quot;local ISP&quot;, if the company that controls the end point at which your phone lines are connected to the internet decides to start filtering, rate limiting, etc. the data you&#x27;re receiving, there&#x27;s not much you can do about it.<p>Heck, even wireless internet providers are working with finite resources.  You can&#x27;t just decide one day that you want to start a business doing wireless networking over large distances without getting the FCC involved.  It&#x27;s to the point that you could basically consider wireless networks with enough broadcast strength to cover a city to have virtual hard lines.  They essentially own those frequencies, so they may as well be considered the same type of finite resource.",1400099901

Here&#x27;s an example: lets imagine it&#x27;s 2005. You have a native application that stores 1 GiB of data to the disk for caching of media assets. Now you would like to reimplement that as a browser app, but there&#x27;s no browser API for disk access. What&#x27;s the solution? You could provide a browser API for direct arbitrary disk access, but that&#x27;s clearly not secure enough. Instead, File API was created with a lot of restrictions compared to the api that the operating system has.<p>If you think it this way, you can go extremely far in replacing native applications. I guess the core problem is that OS APIs were not designed to execute unsafe code, but browser APIs are.<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s no application-level feature that couldn&#x27;t be implemented with a well-designed browser API.<p>In addition, I like it that browsers are creating new APIs relatively slowly.

And most of the time, these days, on a modern unix, you&#x27;re covered by the package manager. But not always. Someone is going to be building or installing on some freaky system, or some old version of something, and every additional dependency is going to be like a red-hot poker up the fundament. More dependencies is wrose.<p>Having lots of processes generally does make things harder to manage. Yes, there are advantages in terms of fault isolation and privilege separation.

Over the last couple of decades, &quot;the Internet&quot; has meant access with something akin to net neutrality in place.<p>What my ISP wants to sell me is not &quot;the Internet&quot;, but something new, which they have yet to define. But from what their lobbyists have put into the FCC proposal, the &quot;Internet&quot; they want to sell me is one where both sender and receiver of data pay them for data. This is not a wholly unreasonable payment model, but it would represent a profound shift in how the Internet is paid for in the U.S.<p>Further, under their proposal, my speeds to any particular website are dependent on how much I pay <i>and</i> how much the other side pays to my ISP (not theirs). Crucially, half of this is wholly outside my control. Of course, I still pay for the full pipe regardless.<p>Note that in particular the source server has not been a customer of my ISP, but the FCC thinks they should become a customer of my ISP so that I can have the speeds I have been sold as of today. This is not how the Internet has worked, and is a new service offering being marketed as &quot;the&quot; Internet.<p>So a better Stripe analogy would be that Stripe offers would be if they 1) first became as big as Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and American Express combined (that would give them approximately the market heft of the American broadband ISPs); 2) required cardholders to buy a Stripe Consumer subscription before processing their cards for merchants.

In particular, it looks at math scores.<p>If I were to challenge the results, I would ask\n1)  Is the test reasonable?\n2)  How aligned is US education with the test compared to the rest of the world?  For example, perhaps in the US students are taught subjects by grade, so may be less familiar with algebra when tested than a student in a country that gradually teaches many subjects.\n3)  How seriously do the students in a given country take the test?  For example, if there are no consequences or questions of national pride, maybe US students simply don&#x27;t care as much about the test.<p>But, if we assume that the answers to these questions are not enough to explain the differences, the US has a serious problem.   There is usually a mythology in the US that if you look at our &quot;best&quot; schools, they are competitive with the rest of the world.  What this study  does is to look at the results of PISA broken down by the educational achievements of the students&#x27; parents (which may also serve as a proxy for wealth).   Here, it finds interesting patterns within the US (for example, Texas is one of the best states in the US for students whose parents have a low level of educational attainment, whereas MA is where you want to be if your parents have a high degree of educational attainment)--it also finds that even in the top performing state (MA) that if you look at students whose parents have the highest level of education, they do not compare favorably with the best in the world.",1400098519

Basically 1000+ entrepreneurs and VC&#x27;s who generally bemoan all things government are now asking that this area be protected from market forces. Very awkward.<p>Right. There&#x27;s a good argument to be made that ISPs have local monopolies (due either to natural failings of utility markets, or to crony government intervention, depending on your political persuasion) and therefore government regulation is a necessary evil that can be accepted in this case even by people who are generally free-market oriented.  But that distinction must be made clear by anyone who wants to salvage their free-market credentials.  Likewise, they must acknowledge that net neutrality will unfortunately destroy benefits that would naturally accrue in a without government regulation: the ability for users who need it to pay a premium for fast or reliable service, a la first class mail.  (You can try to carve out exceptions for this with <i>even more</i> complex regulation, but the serious downsides of this must too be acknowledged.)",1400098329

The Internet is not the same category of thing as Stripe, or pretty much anything else that I can think of.  The Internet is a network of networks.  Net neutrality is what allowed it to grow and flourish to everyone&#x27;s mutual benefit.  It is not AT&T/Comcast/Verizon that created the Internet and thus have the right to control it, rather they are selling <i>access</i> to the Internet which they can profit from not because of their initiative and innovation, but because of a much larger collaborative effort and series of gentleman&#x27;s agreements that predate their involvement.  They have leverage because of a monopoly on the last mile to consumers and they are trying whatever shenanigans they can to capitalize on that advantage, but it&#x27;s all bullshit, and to even entertain their bullshit with false analogies for the sake of some deluded sense of fairness is really a bad idea.<p>What Stripe does is the same as any other payment gateway.  Not only did they fully create their own platform, but there are dozens of competitors with no barrier to entry, and mind you, even if they did have some kind of monopoly to something they themselves built, it still wouldn&#x27;t fall into the same category as the Internet.<p>Even suggesting this comparison is to frame the debate in favorable terms for the telecoms, and they definitely don&#x27;t deserve the support.",1400098211

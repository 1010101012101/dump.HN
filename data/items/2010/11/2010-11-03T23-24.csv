If you're referring to embedded media using HTML5 tags, then I'm pretty sure you could write a simple Firefox Jetpack script to return null inside the page, and play it in the status bar instead. But that wouldn't work everywhere (as few websites use the audio tag).<p>Another alternative, which I doubt will gain adoption, is using a custom protocol like media:[url], which when you hit play, instead of playing it as a page element, it tells the browser to play it (like Windows Media Player or VLC).

1866965,comment,1866485,1866485,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Currently attending engineering at u of waterloo in Canada. In my own experience, most of first year was a waste of time. Due to my luck in highschool as well as my own personal interests, I found 80% of first year to be review, or ridiculously slow. The most important part of first year for me was a relatively low stress environment to make friends with (particularly important in my program).<p>But I saw with many (not all) of my classmates just how important that first year was. Unfortunately, the differences between people's high school educations were just so much (there were some people who were having problems with limits... I was breezing all the way up to multi variable calculus and linear algebra) that as useless as individual courses may be for individual students, taken as a whole (as a class), all those 'review' classes were definitely necessary to prevent massive massive 2nd year fail rates.<p>Unfortunately this is not a problem that can only be solved by universities. They have their role to play, but so does our (by this I mean our province's) high school curriculum. In Toronto (where I grew up), we had integration (and almost derivatives) ripped out of standard grade 12 calculus (as well as a series of similar neuterings in other subjects). To get that stuff at all, your school had to offer honors, AP, or IB calculus or w/e. I lucked out with AP being available (which despite all the taunting I directed at the College Board did actually set me up for my first year university courses). But many bright smart kids just aren't lucky enough to attend to a school with such programs. Or even just average or slightly above average kids weren't pushed by the challenge, or dragged along by their smarter classmates.<p>In the end, (at least in Canada), I cannot see first year becoming any harder (or useful) until universities know that enough of their enrollees will be knowledgeable enough. Because ultimately, they are run as businesses on some level, and have to keep a float. Which is the biggest shame.",1288827794

It was social engineering, really: by convincing schools that their students would be held accountable to universal standards, those schools would in turn up their games and make sure students were learning the real deal.<p>Of course, what actually happened was twofold:<p>1. ""Teaching to the test,"" i.e., narrowing a broad subject area like Calculus down to whatever aspects would be covered on a standardized AP exam.<p>2. Following from the above, a reduction in foundational and principle education in favor of problem-based education. Kids would learn the what of the formulas, but not the why. Kids could calculate a derivative, but they couldn't tell you what it meant or why they would ever need to do so.<p>The result? A vicious cycle. Subjects narrowed and became divorced from their foundational purposes, which accordingly made them more about rote than about thinking, which made them less engaging subjects, which in turn discouraged student interest, which in turn led to declining scores. And the cycle repeated itself.",1288826369

I can only comment for the subjects I took.<p>Physics- too much emphasis on theory and step by step problems. I think solving a complete, complex problem shows much more understanding of physics, than the present state, where you can spend a month learning the theory by hard and then solve quite basic problems with lots of guidance, and pass the final exam with a decent grade.<p>Maths - great, I liked, even if it was hard. Much harder than A levels<p>Languages B (there a A and B, A meaning that it is intended for native speakers)- they could be a bit harder. It is unnecessary to study to get a decent grade. One can get a 6 or 7 (grades are up to 7) by just attending class.<p>Languages A- awesome. We didn't lose time learning much  about history (there was just enough) like I would have to in the national baccalaureate system in Slovenia, but learned to write and speak. This includes blogs, journal articles, essays, political speeches, presentations...<p>TOK <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)</a> 
The way it was taught at our school it was a waste of time. Apparently the professors were not well trained to teach it. This subject could be of great use if well taught.<p>Geography was nice and greatly taught, but I think its similar to the national system and the A levels.<p>What is the outcome of the IB for me?
Now I am studying Computing at the public university where I get to meet people from all backgrounds, schools and educational systems. I can tell that I have a much deeper understanding of maths and physics than everyone else who didn't do the IB.
Many students don't even understand calculus, complex numbers and vectors. Not to speak about physics.
Some went to CS high schools before, but apart from some programming knowledge they lag behind by much. 
The result is that I am bored in class. We've spent the first month revising what I did in the IB, and we are still gonna do it for quite some time. Plus we learn LESS than in the IB. We don't go as deep.<p>So yes, I think the first year of university/college is quite a waste of time if you were an IB student and you were quite good.<p>The first year of university seems to me as a catchup for the 'bad students'. We don't build on what we learned in high school, but instead relearn it with less insight into the principles of the subjects.",1288826046

1866884,comment,1866485,1866521,0,0,SiVal,,,"There is great political pressure in most countries to ""improve"" the education of the population. This runs into other political, demographic, and scientific realities and produces some ironic consequences. For example, in the US, we have a higher and higher percentage of the population entering college each year. That means that the average IQ of those entering college gradually declines. (It wouldn't if the Flynn Effect still functioned, but gains from the Flynn Effect in the US ended 20-30 years ago.) The top 10% has a higher average IQ than the top 20%, which is itself greater than for the top 30%, etc. The higher the percentage going to college, the lower the average IQ of college students, and the colleges have to adjust to avoid an embarrassing rise in drop-out rates.<p>I saw statistics a week or so ago showing a gradual rise in the percentage of students who take calculus in high school, a gradual rise in the percentage who take Algebra 1 in eighth grade (instead of in 9th, 10th, etc.), and other stats that would seem to imply a gradual increase in math ability for any given age cohort. Yet, within a day or two, I also saw stats showing a gradual decrease in math ability for high school graduates entering college. In 1995, the College Board could no longer continue with the old SAT and had to ""renormalize"" it to get the mean score back up to 500. They had to dumb it down, in other words.<p>I've seen stats and reports from other countries (including Japan) that show the same trends. People demand that the schools do a better job of getting kids ready for college by, for example, having more of them take algebra in 8th grade. So, it happens, except that they aren't really any better prepared than before, so to prevent the embarrassment of rising failure rates, the course has to be dumbed down. The apparent increase in math ability is achieved by a relabeling of what they do, not by an increase in how much they learn. There is now a growing trend in Illinois for students (I assume from Chicago) to take calculus in high school and then end up in remedial math in college. They're not learning anything, but for political reasons they are given classes labeled ""calculus"" to show ""progress toward social justice"". I assume Illinois is representative of many other places in many countries.",1288825379

Specifically when these concepts tend to be far away from developed countries. Much easier to feel a direct threat if your enemy has a name or a face and invades/attacks your space.

For ""challenging"" algorithm work in real life, I did topological sort for evaluating dependency graph, bloom filter for skipping lookup, NFA for executing regex-like rule graph, Rete for faster rule evaluation, extendible hashing for fast index storage, complex event flow graph with SQL-like nodes.  Those are the ones I can remember now.<p>BTW, I did got bit by O(nlgn) vs O(n^2) issue, despite computers being fast nowaday.  Once I used bubble sort in a cache system.  It was quick and simple.  Things work fine for small size cache but slowed down substantially when size > 10,000; n^2 => 100,000,000 ops.  Switching to heap sort did solve the problem.  So yes, understanding algorithmic complexity does help in real life work.<p>However, 99% of development are run of the mill coding.",1287224897

It's depressing to see the ""flag"" feature of HN used to suppress topics that are intellectually interesting, but killed just because <i>the ignorant masses</i> happen to find the topic distasteful.<p>For what it's worth, I know exactly what you mean by ""burnt out googing"". It's the feeling you get when you wish other people loved to talk about how to solve random problems as much as you love to talk about solutions to random problems. It's the lack of human-to-human interaction to accomplish a shared goal. It's the sour taste in your mouth from realizing just how little <i>thinking</i> most people  you're forced to interact with actually do, and consequently conclude that most people don't care about being stupid. And since most results of most google searches result in wading through wave after wave of stupidity, sometimes your brain says <i>enough</i> and forces you to actually <i>talk</i> with someone who will hopefully make the whole process just a little bit enjoyable.<p>I have personally felt ""burnt out googling"", just like you.)",1287224190

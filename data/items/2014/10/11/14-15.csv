I had a period of lengthy commuting when I listed to a ton of audiobooks, and found that Banks&#x27; Culture novels -- narrated by Peter Kenny in paricular -- were excellent. Kenny&#x27;s performances really brought the works to life. A bad narrator can kill a good audiobook, and even a terrific one can&#x27;t salvage a bad read. But pair an outstanding author with first-rate narration, and it&#x27;s transformative. Highly recommended! :)",1413039583

8442311,comment,8441671,8441797,0,0,threeseed,,,"I live in the Melbourne CBD and have used the city cycle scheme. The problem isn&#x27;t the scheme. It&#x27;s the fact that it is downright suicidal to ride in many parts of the city. The cycling infrastructure e.g. dedicated lanes are inadequate, there are blind spots all over the place and car drivers are not taught from day one how to check for cyclists moving around them. I know people who have been crippled from cycling.<p>And you are being pretty ridiculous by mentioning the health benefits. Cycling without adequate infrastructure is dangerous. Much more dangerous than a bit of a cardio. It is far better for people&#x27;s health to educate them to stand up and take a walk a few times a day.<p>Fix the infrastructure first.

We went from initial concept to MVP in about 2 weeks using some of the ideas around superfast development I outlined in this talk [0].<p>Where the rabbithole came in is once we put out the MVP, we were bombarded with feature requests for things that were beyond simply an easier way to fill out forms (this is where alot of the CRM functionality came in).<p>We haven&#x27;t reached out to anyone in government or K-12. We&#x27;d like to build our forms framework and keep it in this little niche market we&#x27;ve discovered and then start reaching out to other markets.<p>Our forms application has been very hard to build as well, but I think we are one major re-factor away from having a good platform. I&#x27;m thinking at the end of the day we are going to get something that looks like a cross between Redmine&#x27;s CRM functionality and Drupal&#x27;s modularity/observer pattern-ness/business logic in the database-ness.<p>What are you guys writing FormBig in? I&#x27;d be interested in collaborating on a set of open-source HTML5 form controls with you guys if that&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re finding a need for. It could address some of the things that I&#x27;ve found lacking in the standard HTML forms (such as the support for an other field and dynamic switching of sub-forms). I&#x27;m probably going to end up writing this library anyway, but it would be good PR for both of us :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/LeeGillentine/superfast-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/LeeGillentine/superfast-developmen...</a>",1413039043

Sure, there are some parts of American culture where you&#x27;re expected to throw a huge fancy ceremony with a $15,000 dress and a limo and a 7-course meal.  But there are parts of American culture where the expected wedding reception is cake and punch, buying a dress on clearance is a mark of pride, and you either drive your own car or borrow a friend&#x27;s car if yours is well below median crapitude.<p>Our total wedding expenses weren&#x27;t quite that low -- 200+ people came in at around $4k, including brunch (it was a mid-morning wedding,) a dress hand-made by the mother of the bride, and rental of a horse-drawn Amish buggy from the farmer next door to the church.<p>Of course, both &quot;lots of people at the wedding&quot; and &quot;spend little money&quot; signify something -- lots of people signifies a lot of social support, and friends and family who think this is a good idea; spending little money is an indicator that the important part is the life you&#x27;re making together, without too much emphasis on the initial celebration.

I&#x27;m sure most will agree that the clients with lower budgets are generally  more &#x27;work&#x27;.<p>So what we do is have initial 2 hour project discovery meeting where we literally go through every page they want, how many pictures/ paragraphs are suitable for each page. We log all of this and send them the full content list of what is needed.<p>Wonderfully, we schedule the &#x27;Platform Training&#x27; meeting (where we sign it over) exactly one week later and send them a content deadline for half-way through that week. No surprises that not a single client has yet to send any content through on time!, so (and we make this absolutely clear) we populate with lorum ipsum and stock imagery proofs to the exact discussed paragraph/image count per page.<p>We do the platform training with the dummy content, show them how to do everything (2 hours) and send them on their way. Monthly hosting (£12.00/month) to cover weebly fees.<p>We&#x27;ve found that with this &#x27;package&#x27; we make no-bones about what they are getting (a template driven site, chosen by us - no design &#x27;sign-off&#x27; etc..). They know the quality of our &#x27;other work&#x27; (it&#x27;s usually why they come to us) except we crucially figure out their budget VERY early on and can &#x27;channel&#x27; into a specific category accordingly. It&#x27;s nice having that other option.<p>It&#x27;s going well so far, 4 clients that we would have turned away, £3.5k income that we would have lost and gone to a bedroom dev or smaller agency. The hours quoted have (amazingly) worked out to the hour for each of these projects (£60/hr rate) - except the latest, which is 2 hours under ATM.

You have a program, and the program is storing data and the &quot;attacker&quot; (here really the user himself) wants to bypass the policies enforced by the application. The attacker has access to both the binary of the app and the data.<p>What would you encrypt the data with that the user himself cannot also access? Without a secure encryption hardware module, there&#x27;s little you can do except add additional layers of obscurity.<p>You could encrypt all the data with a key derived off the user&#x27;s password, and require the user to re-enter the key if the app stops. That too could be broken.<p>You could store the images in some odd obfuscated format that only the app can understand.

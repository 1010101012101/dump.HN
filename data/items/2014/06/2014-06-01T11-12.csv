7828876,comment,7828527,7828527,10,0,tokenadult,,,"The article reminds us, &quot;In 1850, four in 10 English babies died before their first birthday.&quot; And that&#x27;s an important point. Today in the developed world it seems almost unimaginable to die in childhood. (The leading cause of death in childhood in most developed countries is &quot;accidents,&quot; especially car crashes, and they are steadily declining in rate.)<p>The headline is a huge overstatement. This idea that modern life makes people sick is one of the most common misconceptions on Hacker News, and I have to keep coming back over and over and over to point to facts on the issue. In point of fact, we are healthier than ever, and living longer than ever. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[1] Trends already in place in incremental improvements in disease prevention and treatment and improvement in medical practice and accessibility of health care make demographers confident in predicting that increases in healthy human lifespan will continue. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[2] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Read this to be up to date with how healthy we are recently. Vaupel&#x27;s striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[3]<p>I suppose it could make me ill to see so many poorly evidenced statements about human health on Hacker News, but I&#x27;m still healthy and cheerful because I remind myself that few participants here have the training and background to evaluate medical claims, and those who do are able to back up what the trends really are. To me, it is alarming that rates of obesity are climbing so steadily recently in so many countries of the world,[4] and I think it&#x27;s fair to say that that trend could eventually slow or even reverse the broader general trend to healthier, longer human life, but it hasn&#x27;t done so yet. Obesity of the kind found in most parts of the world is a much more tractable problem than the problems that used to weaken and sicken and kill us, and I&#x27;ve already figured out strategies for avoiding obesity, even in middle age and even in the environment of lavish food availability I enjoy here in the United States. I build regular exercise into my lifestyle by walking rather than driving to many of my daily errands (I live in an outer-ring suburb with a city walking trail system, but I used to do the same in the inner city neighborhoods I&#x27;ve lived in at various times).<p>Summing up, antibiotics are not making us generally ill. They are killing a lot of bacteria, and most alarmingly adding selective pressure to the environment of bacteria to select descendant bacteria resistant to current antibiotics. But we are healthier than before. We can continue to become healthier than before while continuing to use antibiotics in human medicine for sick people who need them.[5]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27586365"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27586365</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6599040#up_6599795"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6599040#up_6599795</a>",1401623999

7828873,story,,,8,13,rblion,"Ask HN: How did you find the courage to try again?",,"I really could use a Gandalf right now...<p>I&#x27;m 24 and from Atlanta, Georgia. I grew up playing with LEGOs and computers. I began to dream of building a &quot;world changing&quot; startup at 17 motivated by the problems I saw in the American education system. I started learning design and code to build a MVP before my 20th birthday. I gave up before launching after seeing projects like Khan Academy, Knewton, and Coursera come out. The domain I owned was www.academiia.com, my original choice was already owned and the guy wanted at least $100,000. At least I learned a lot before starting college...<p>After that, I took on a design and marketing job at Myriann (www.myriann.com) while taking classes at a community college. I worked on TalkHotels.com and RoomSailor.com among many other projects. I had to leave because I felt burnt out from working on things that didn&#x27;t excite me. I had notebooks full of ideas and UI&#x27;s for problems that should be solved but haven&#x27;t been by the looks of HN and Twitter. I knew I couldn&#x27;t waste any more time not living my dreams...<p>I quit the job and dropped out to take some time off to &quot;collect myself&quot; and in the process went through depression, a bad breakup, and even suicidal thoughts knowing that I had nothing to live for if I couldn&#x27;t help solve world problems through my technology. I thought I&#x27;d missed my chance because all the great founders were way ahead of me at this age, that no investor wants someone outside of California and NYC, and without a degree no one would give me a job if all else fails. Unhealthy thinking looking back in hindsight.<p>Right now, I work at a financial company working on the hardware and software for ATM machines. I study design and code for hours every day because some new ideas I have keep me up at night like when I first started on this path. I don&#x27;t want to go back to school and waste more time. I want to save enough and apply for App Academy or something similar as a fall back plan. I just have to be a player on the field and not a spectator in the stands. My soul will be crushed if I don&#x27;t realize my potential.<p><i></i><i></i>How did you get back up after failing? After seeing other people create what you envisioned? After burnout? After seeing all the media about brogrammers and sexism? With the neverending talks of a coming bubble?<i></i><i></i> Please help a brother out. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one needing some guidance. Thanks.",1401623922

There is no need to climb stairs due to escalators/lifts, there is no need to carry bags as there are trolleys everywhere in the supermarket, our jobs mostly involve sitting on a chair in an airconditioned office for hours and hours and since we working longer hours, whatever meagre free time we have, we spend it on the chair in front of the computer/couch in front of TV.

7828869,comment,7828559,7828820,1,0,VLM,,,"Two other major reasons for payday loan places to exist are identity theft (especially of elderly) and money laundering, and neither will go away because the post office is competing.<p>Several problems exist that haven&#x27;t been discussed.<p>One is coupling / product tying.  If you screw up financially, no other bank or financial player will want to cooperate with you, universal default and all that.  Bounce a check there, they won&#x27;t accept a check over there.  So... if you default on a post office loan, that means the P.O. will stop allowing you to send or rx mail, right?  I mean, they gotta get leverage somehow.  So... if the P.O. is in the loan biz and my letter carrier knows his job exists because people don&#x27;t do biz with capital one, then physical spam from capital one might not make it into my mailbox, just sayin.  Or even worse, old people who still pay bills physically might find that car payments to loaners other than the P.O. might often not be delivered...<p>Another problem is consistency.  Nothing sounds dumber on the internet than people all over the planet arguing with each other about which multinational cellphone provider has better or worse radio coverage in their house and by extension the entire world... or their local post office is either great or sucks.  Fix that first, of be doomed to endless dumb sounding complaints on the internet.  Banks are fairly consistent, at least compared to cellphone coverage or postal service.<p>So your bread and butter main line product is going away because people are switching online both for personal-ish mail and spam.  So your bright idea is to enter yet another field where virtually everything is moving online and paperless as fast as possible.  Brilliant.<p>Finally I don&#x27;t see any synergy.  If there was a flaming roaring demand to merge postal services with banking services, why doesn&#x27;t every bank/CU have a UPS/fedex branch office?  There seems to be an immense synergy between food stores and banks, its almost like there&#x27;s a law locally that food stores must have a colocated bank branch.  Admittedly very few freestanding bank branches sell bacon and doritos.  Still I think it far more likely and realistic to see a bank selling ice cream, beer, and popsicles than a post office selling mortgages.",1401623866

7828867,comment,7828559,7828802,8,0,jnbiche,,,">Part of the reason this sector is so scummy is because of the bad reputation it carries. Reputable players want to stay out of it.<p>Maybe, but I&#x27;ll mention the <i>primary</i> reason the sector is so scummy: regulation.  Banking -- including check cashing -- is a prime example of regulatory capture.<p>In my state, the now-incumbent check cashing companies are busy at work creating even <i>more</i> expensive regulatory requirements, all for the &quot;public&#x27;s protection&quot;, even as they scalp and cheat the underclasses.<p>So you may wish to stay out of the sector because of its bad reputation, but I would love nothing more than to dive into it and bring fair and reasonable-priced banking to the underserved.  And with hard work, mobile-friendly UIs, and modern machine learning techniques, it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible.<p>But I can&#x27;t even try, because I can&#x27;t cough up the many millions of dollars required to pay for regulatory compliance.<p>But I totally agree that the idea that the post office will somehow succeed in wiping out the entire payday/check-cashing industry is pretty unrealistic.

7828825,comment,7828239,7828539,2,0,mkozlows,,,"The region thing (along with vim modes) is probably one of the biggest pieces of pushback I&#x27;ve gotten from the piece, and I think it certainly has some merit to it.  If you can use movement commands to define a region, and then act on that region, isn&#x27;t that the same as vim&#x27;s composability in effect?<p>I think the best answer is &quot;sorta, but not really.&quot;<p>The biggest reason why is that Emacs commands don&#x27;t all work on a region by default.  Yes, there&#x27;s C-w to kill-region, but there&#x27;s still C-k to kill-line and other special-purpose commands out there. In Vim, there aren&#x27;t four special-purpose delete commands and then a general-purpose one, they all work the same way.  This feels like a qualitative difference to me -- both in theory, and in practice.<p>When I used Emacs for many years, I definitely did use the region commands, but only when the special purpose ones wouldn&#x27;t work reasonably (like deleting large chunks of code).  If I just wanted to delete (for instance) the stuff inside an HTML tag, I wouldn&#x27;t try to mark off a region and then delete it, I&#x27;d just delete by word/character until it was gone. In Vim, I&#x27;d &quot;dt>&quot; automatically, because that just makes a lot more sense than repeatedly typing &quot;dw&quot;.<p>And ironically, Emacs has a command (M-z is the mapping for kill-to-character) that would do exactly the same as that Vim command.  But in fourteen years of Emacsing, I never even looked for it, because Emacs doesn&#x27;t steer you that way.  Vim makes you always think about what object you&#x27;re applying your command to, and because you always have to make a choice, you look for good choices; Emacs generally defaults you to one of a few often-decent choices, and you don&#x27;t get into general-purpose mode unless the built-ins are unworkable.",1401622081

Part of the reason this sector is so scummy is because of the bad reputation it carries. Reputable players want to stay out of it. (2) Create simple financial services (possibly subsidised) aimed at the poor.<p>But... the idea that they are going to wipe out an industry, cut the revenues by 90% and make a 100% of the remaining 10% those revenue in profit is idiotic.

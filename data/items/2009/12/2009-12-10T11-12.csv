There's no doubt that the complexity of silicon has increased by leaps and bounds in the decades since the 60s - but what about the code we write to drive them?<p>The complexity of code - not the compiled binary - the text you punch into the machine and what it semantically represents, has not really gotten <i>that</i> much more complicated over the years. We've introduced several new paradigms since the COBOL mainframes: object orientation, functional, to name a couple. It'd be hard to argue, though, that it follows Moore's Law. Not even close.<p>> They just cannot fail utterly without people being pissed.<p>This is an important point: people who expect flawless behaviour from software because other fields of engineering demonstrate it, IMHO, are misguided. Aircraft engineers work <i>incredibly</i> slowly because the consequences of fucking up is perhaps thousands of deaths, and billions in liabilities. Car engineers are the same on a lesser scale. There's no need to expect flawless, 100% perfect function when you don't <i>need</i> flawless, 100% perfect function.<p>We could spend 20 years developing the perfect toaster that will <i>never, ever</i> burn your toast. Or we can spend 2 months on something that will get it right 97% of the time, and just move on with our lives.",1260445950

A lot of type signatures in Haskell code are not technically necessary and are usual there for documentation.<p>For example, this is perfectly valid Haskell code and doesn't mention a single type:<p><pre><code>    factorial n = if n > 0 then n * factorial (n-1) else 1

The bigger conceptual shift will be from Python's mainly procedural style to Haskell's (or Clojure's) very strong emphasis on a functional style.",1260445037

As a startup, you can't do anything to make a platform itself ultra-popular. Say, you develop a new hip location-based service for Palm Web OS, but Palm Web OS never passes a few million users. You can do nada about it.<p>But what is worse, during that time, you don't learn much about your own service, because your biggest problem is to get any users for it. When you then decide to port it to more successful platforms, you still don't know what works, what gets people excited about your service etc.<p>In a contrast, on an ultra-popular platform, if your service goes unrecognized, you can do something about it and you can learn from your efforts. You try out different marketing techniques, maybe they don't work, but all the time you are learning and getting feedback of your effors.",1260443933

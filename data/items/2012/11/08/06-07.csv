His assassination effectively canonized the program. (I think he'd argue my terming that an ""advantage."") Cutting it after his death would have been political suicide. Where space exploration often has the same inherent challenge as nuclear powerspecifically that the length of any serious endeavor will span several presidents, congresses, senates, to say nothing of economic cycles, (see CxP)the Apollo program, despite being 2.2% of all federal outlays, had broad support.<p>There were numerous other factors, but I think those two played a big part in its success.",1352357735

4756738,comment,4755470,4755594,3,0,viviantan,,,"While it's true that not everyone can afford the ""best"" that money can buy, whatever that means, picking the best <i>quality</i> whenever possible is quite the opposite of materialism. I associate materialism with superficiality and waste. None of the things you mentioned here were chosen merely to satisfy some status seeking urge. And because these things didn't need to be constantly replaced because they soon broke or went out of style, the people who chose them likely spent less time thinking about what to buy (""materialism"" in your view) and more time doing what matters to them.<p>I agree with you only to the extent that people are important and so are the connections we build with them. What I don't get is your argument against appreciating a fine set of cutlery or a well-made wallet when these things were specifically designed to make the lives of people who use them a little better. Well-made things let people live their lives more fully. Dustin Curtis clearly enjoyed his time abroad because he didn't have to worry about his backpack exploding during his travels (a lesson I learned the hard way). Steve Jobs spent months picking a washing machine so he wouldn't have to worry about ruining clothes or wasting water. Clearly that freed up time for SJ to do plenty of other things.",1352357280

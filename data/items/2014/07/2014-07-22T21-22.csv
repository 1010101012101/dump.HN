Mozilla&#x27;s slogan on their homepage is &quot;Commited to your privacy and an open web&quot;. Being committed to privacy means being open and explicit about the data captured through their browser services, no matter how innocuous the data might seem. It also means presenting that information clearly and making it easy to find.

To check the file is safe to download, Firefox contacts Google to use a service they provide called Safe Browsing. Google checks if the file is harmful or safe, and sends this information back to Firefox (this normally happens in a few seconds). If the file is safe, Firefox will start the download. If the file is harmful, Firefox will block the download and display a warning message.<p>When Firefox uses the Safe Browsing feature, it needs to send Google information about your download. Google records the following information from Firefox: your IP address, the name of the file you are downloading, the address of the website, and [insert any other data recorded here]. [Also insert a re-assurance that Google does not keep a record of all your downloads against your Google account or against your IP address - assuming this is the case. Also explain how Google uses that info. and how long it&#x27;s kept for etc.]<p>[Then finally explain how to switch off this feature if you don&#x27;t want to use Google&#x27;s Safe Browsing feature.]&quot;</i>",1406066019

It works in the scientific sense, but it&#x27;s not been easy for me to achieve success through it. However, what little benefit it&#x27;s had was enough that I can now say I&#x27;m generally happy (but nothing fills the emptiness, you just learn that that&#x27;s how things are). I read some Zen and Mindfulness material (also see Sam Harris as it&#x27;s hard to find this material stripped of its religious culture) and that has helped me.

So yes, most developers are average, but what is average? Is it necessarily developers who need training wheels, helmets and elbow pads in order to protect themselves and others?<p>That may be the reality, for all I know. But that isn&#x27;t necessarily a timeless truth. Take a room of expert programmers; now most of them are mediocre (average), relative to each other (imagine a really big room with a lot of experts, if you must). But that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that they need languages that cramp their style in order to mitigate whatever damage they might do.<p>&quot;Mediocre&quot; is the same as &quot;average&quot;, but with more negative connotations. Hence, when someone says that some people are &#x27;mediocre&#x27;, the immediate thought might be &quot;bad&quot;. Then it becomes obvious that tools need to hinder these <i>bad</i> developers from screwing up too much. But <i>mediocre</i> is just a relative term, and can mean that they are really bad developers who create 100 bugs for every feature they implement, or that they are really competent, reliable developers.<p>I won&#x27;t comment on the skill of the average (mediocre) developer. But I think that saying &quot;most are mediocre&quot; can easily hint at &quot;most are bad&quot; (because of connotations, not necessarily because that was the intent).",1406065037

We developed iOS and HTML5 prototypes of Sodaconstructor a while ago which work nicely. It is however a significant amount of work creating a new backend to support the million or so models we have in the database and porting the other tools like Moovl. We are planning to do a Kickstarter to raise funds for the dev work, but need to clean our database of 250,000 registered users&#x27; emails which costs money otherwise we&#x27;ll be instantly blocked as spammers. I very much hope to have the Kickstarter online, bring Sodaplay up to date and reinstate a lot of the version 1 features people liked e.g the zoo!",1406063994

This then updates the page nicely, including the RSS feed and whatnot.<p>* No user comment feature required; it&#x27;s okay if users mail-in comments, and there is a way to publish selections from the mailbag.",1406062856

4541975,comment,4539668,4539668,2,0,kristianp,,,"Here's an insightful comment from the blog page, about cpu and memory usage:<p>I downloaded patricks fork and got 4300r/s with maxprocs 1 with the go version, out the box.<p>Recompiling and running with gomaxprocs=100, i got 4400r/s.<p>mvn deploy and running auth-1.0.jar on JDK 1.7 on my box similarly peaked out at 3100r/s.<p>It's worth noting though, that I was using patricks httperf bench.sh modification, and it appears that httperf was cpu bound in both cases, with the kernel and postres taking about half a core between them.<p>Using wrk, by contrast, spun main (the go program) up to 2.5 cores, and 6000r/s. Java under wrk lit all cores for a time, then hit `Exception in thread ""async-log-appender-0"" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` `Caused by: ! org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: sorry, too many clients already`<p>A bit more investigation and tuning later, using 10 clients `wrk -c 10 -r 100000 -t 4 -H 'Authorization: basic apikey_value' <a href=""http://localhost:8080/authenticate`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/authenticate`</a> Java was spinning out 10kr/s. Go was limited to 6kr/s. It's worth noting some more details however: Go only ever spun up two postgres forks, whereas java spun up 10. There's scope for optimization there. Go used 8mb of ram, whereas java was sitting on 130mb after a few runs. The Java version, cranking out at 10kr/s was maxing the kernel out on one core, so that's probably approaching the practical limit for single machine tests.<p>I suspect putting a load balancer in front of a couple of instances of the go program would allow you to totally smash the java performance, given that it lit 2 cores at 6kr/s, and java lit 8 at 10kr/s. The memory usage tradeoff is significant - JVM sitting at 130mb and Go sitting at 8mb. Clearly everyone needs to draw their own conclusions on this, for their own purposes. The JVM solution is carrying a stats server, a ton of other tooling and so on. The Go system has some - pprof was included, but it's limited by comparison. Arguably gdb and so on can actually be of real use in the Go case, but that's also an exercise for the reader.<p>Interesting any which way you look at it. There are a lot of other interesting side effects (that need working out) in both programs as evidenced by this simple testing. Postgres also needs some tuning if you really want to slam this with anything remotely resembling a real world scale test.<p>My tests were done on OSX 10.8 12B19 on a 2.3GHz i7 wiht 8GB of DDR3 at 1333MHz, an intel 510 SSD, totally untuned postgres. The machine is a Macbook from whatever year that is.<p>Here's wrk, for anyone looking for it: <a href=""https://github.com/wg/wrk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wg/wrk</a>",1348027038

I did it because Apple's fascination with perfecting form and design has somehow morphed into this inability to innovate.<p>The primary reason I switched was that one day, I opened up my home screen and realized it hasn't changed in 5 years. We still open apps one at a time, each app allotted a sort of pseudo background API that allows minimal functionality. And God those apps are pretty. And the FPS is amazing. And the fluidity of the experience is breathtaking... but at the end of the day, my device is about acquiring information. I want to know when my train is coming, I want to save map info when I don't have a connection, I want to know that when I leave for work and hit the subway, Pocket auto downloaded all those articles I saved for later.<p>Apple still maintains the best hardware, hands down. It's not even comparable. But it's irrelevant if the apps that reside on that phone are completely crippled by a draconian sense of design and control. If the phone has a ""workstation tower processor"" inside it, why the hell can't they let up and let the thing actually PROCESS more information?<p>I'll miss the beauty of it, that's for sure, but unless Apple gets its act together with background processing and figuring out how to actually do cloud anything right, I'm moving to Google.",1348026958

4541963,comment,4540776,4540776,6,0,jellicle,,,"For some reason no one has remarked on one of my biggest problems with Jelly Bean - that Google no longer lets you opt-out of being tracked.  There are two location services, which used to be called coarse (uses names of nearby Wifi networks and such) and fine (GPS).  Google now won't let you use coarse without also opting in to having your location sent to Google at all times, whether you are using any application or not.  So, for example, Google Maps doesn't work unless you opt in to being tracked at all times.  Google Now doesn't work at all unless you opt-in to being tracked at all times.  Etc.<p>In prior versions of Android, being tracked 24/7/365 was a separate checkbox you could opt out of while retaining full location functionality when you desired it, e.g. for Google Maps.  No longer.<p>No one in the press seems to have picked up on this unadvertised feature change of Jelly Bean.",1348026904

But in the SQL world that's not really the same thing as ad hoc reporting.<p>I suppose ""can't do"" is too strong assuming your reporting matches your query.  However these things look a lot simpler to do in SQL than in Mongo's approach, and I don't see how you can reliably transform data on output if you don't have a guaranteed reliable schema on input.  Also I don't really understand how you would transform the data in this way with Mongo's API.  I suppose you always could but it looks painful to my (admittedly uninitiated) eyes.<p>How many lines of code are required to express a 50 line SQL query doing 5 joins, complex filters and group-by transformations, etc?",1348026184

It implies that most people here have decided that their dream involves starting a company (or two) and working with the smartest people, and that the subject is closed.<p>I have my doubts as to whether or not this actually qualifies as a fulfillable desire. This desire is large and abstract, and impossible to feel directly. What we have to work with, in the moment, are smaller urges to do this or that.<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger was a champion body builder, but what he loved was the workouts. In ""Pumping Iron"" he famously claimed that lifting weights felt ""like an orgasm"". Someone like that is bound to be successful as a weight lifter.<p>What is the equivalent to lifting weights in business? I would guess that it is the feeling of winning - of having made a good deal, and of effortlessly executing whatever obligations come your way. Time and money from these successes can be used to invest in making even more good deals, and making execution even more effortless - and you have yourself a business.<p>So, basically if ""making good deals"" and ""effortless execution"" feels like orgasm to you, then you'll get your 8 businesses.",1348026104

Braid, Bastion, Iji, Super Meat Boy, Gish, World of Goo, and many more where those came from follow that model: impressive engine, pile of well-designed levels, plot.  In those cases, the ability to create more levels and add some technical variations can nicely extend the lifespan of a game.<p>Second, and even more importantly, the much broader space of design ideas in indie games means many more interesting components with unusual variations.  Braid has a physics engine that supports time-based mechanics.  Super Meat Boy has an extremely impressive record-and-replay mechanism (used to great effect at the end of each level to show you all the ways you died simultaneously).  Several indie games have very impressive lighting models.  The Bit Trip games have music syncing engines.  Many indie games have impressive dynamic-content-generation engines.  The more of these components that become readily available, the more impressive the starting point for any future indie game.",1348024207

4541834,comment,4540719,4541546,15,0,DennisP,,,"Biggest benefit, but theoretically hardest to achieve, is boron fusion, which is nonradioactive. Since the energy is carried away in charged particles instead of neutrons, you don't need a steam cycle.<p>Focus fusion would be a small boron fusion device, producing 5MW per reactor at a tenth the price of coal. Potential drawbacks: the energy gain is a bit marginal so you have to also capture x-rays, and erosion of the electrodes could be a problem. But a 5MW plant should only cost half a million or so.<p>Picosecond laser would also do boron fusion (which in that design is only ten times harder than D-T), but with a 10,000x energy gain, divided by the one percent efficiency of the laser. It's projected to produce power as cheaply as focus fusion.<p>Tri-Alpha supposedly could achieve boron fusion but they've been very tight-lipped about the whole thing. They've gotten  close to $100 million in venture capital though, including from Paul Allen.<p>Polywell, if it works, could do D-T fusion in a 2-meter sphere, or boron fusion in a 3-meter. I've seen relatively high projected costs, though that may be for D-T. If you're a scifi fan, this was invented by the guy who came up with Bussard ramjets. He was also a big tokamak guy, before he gave up on them.<p>Levitated dipole sorta turns tokamaks inside-out, with the plasma contained around the outside of a solid levitating torus. This seems to solve some plasma instabilities that tokamaks struggle with. They say it would be ideal for D-D fusion.<p>Deuterium (for D-D) and boron are readily available in large quantities relative to what we'd need. D-T needs tritium, which would have to be made by bombarding lithium with the neutrons from the fusion reaction. This would limit how fast we could roll out the reactors. D-D and D-T would both require steam turbines. Most people focus on D-T since it has the least stringent requirements, and the rest of these are D-T.<p>General Fusion uses a vat of molten lead and lithium, spinning to open a channel down the middle. A plasma ball is shot in from each end, then 200 steam-driven pistons slam into the container, making an acoustic shock wave that compresses the D-T plasma. The neutrons hit the lithium for tritium, heat the lead, and it all drives the steam turbine, with some steam diverted to drive the pistons. Jeff Bezos is a big investor in this one. Right now they've got the pistons working with the tight timing they need, and a prototype with a dozen pistons or so.<p>NIF says they're farthest along the development path, they're leveraging big advances in lasers, and with their LIFE development they're already working with thirty or so commercial suppliers to put together a practical reactor design with as much off-the-shelf equipment as possible. They don't need as much tritium inventory to start up as tokamaks, and think they can be competitive with fossil fuels. They've been talking 2020 or so for a demo reactor, but they also thought they'd manage ignition this year, and a recent DOE report said it'll be another couple years.<p>Helion targets a middle ground between tokamaks and NIF, in terms of temperature and density, which they think will be easier. They need $20 million for a full-size reactor, already built a 1/3-scale test unit. They're also working with NASA on a fusion rocket design.<p>Tokamak (like ITER) seems to be on a solid path to net power, but it's such a huge, complicated, expensive device that it's hard to imagine it being economical, and they're talking about a thirty year timeframe at best.",1348023793

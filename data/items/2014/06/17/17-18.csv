7905882,story,,,1,0,josh_nyc,"Ask HN: Sales for a small web consultancy: am I too small to hire a salesperson?",,"I run a small, &quot;boutique&quot; web consultancy under my own name. Thus far I&#x27;ve done my own sales and project management. I&#x27;m a back-end developer and sub out my design and front-end. I&#x27;ve finally hit my new year&#x27;s resolution of delegating more: I&#x27;m now subbing out most of my back-end dev as well, leaving me to focus on client relations and management.\nMy subs are all remote folks I&#x27;ve coded in the trenches with and trust. My customers are all word-of-mouth and view me as a &quot;developer + team&quot; rather than a Brand, LLC type of firm. I follow the (somewhat risky) model of One Large Client + Several Smaller Clients, and cashflow is usually decent.<p>The sales cycle in my business can be lengthy -- a few weeks of courting followed by a few weeks of estimation, proposals, and contracts. I typically receive leads from my contacts and do the rest myself, but I want to delegate this process as well if possible.<p>Question: how can I leverage a commission-only tech-knowledgable sales-person in this situation?<p>Challenges are:<p>a) I can only take so many clients at once (until I scale up operations), so I definitely won&#x27;t be this salesperson&#x27;s only source of work.<p>b) Beyond procuring the lead and getting the customer excited about the business solutions we can provide, it seems that the bulk of the sales cycle (the in-depth proposals, etc.) is out of scope for most salespeople.<p>Is the occasional mid-4-figures (USD) commission enough to attract a salesperson who can do more than just get me leads? One who can go deeper with potential clients before I have to jump in?<p>Advice and feedback welcome, as I&#x27;m sure I may be overlooking some possibilities here.",1403027943

7905876,comment,7903938,7905826,2,0,api,,,"Unfortunately religious guilt often gets replaced by secular neo-Malthusian doomsday ideology. That might not be your experience but it seems to be common. It plugs into the same port: &quot;forgive us nature for we have sinned... we have overshot our ecological carrying capacity...&quot;<p>Another thing about secularism that bothers me (and I am not religious) is the strong negative association with birth rates. Look up the statistics. The more rational your worldview is the less you reproduce, to the point that most very secular nations are in demographic decline. Difficult investments in the future such as child rearing seem to be replaced by an evolutionary dead end Epicurean lifestyle.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that everyone should join the Quiverfull movement, but it bothers me that fertility is inversely correlated to a rational worldview. Darwin is clearly on the side of fanaticism and superstition, in that if there is any genetic basis to these traits we are strongly selecting for them. Even if there is no genetic basis, beliefs propagate most strongly from parent to child so we are certainly culturally selecting for fanatical religious ideologies in the long term. A higher proportion of tomorrow&#x27;s children will be the product of today&#x27;s fundamentalists. I suspect this is why severe religious ideologies are historically so powerful. Those that didn&#x27;t hold them left fewer descendants.<p>I see a connection there -- between deep pessimism and lack of fertility -- that points to some kind of psychological vacuum related to motivation and hope. Seems like when you take away myth, you take away teleological action. Actions belong to the realm of narrative -- storytelling -- not fact. This is as true in the secular realm as in the religious -- progress is a myth, not a fact. In the extreme it takes on a quasi-religious tone in the form of &quot;the Singularity&quot; and similar ideas. Even companies have myths, and startup founders often have to put on at least a little bit of a guru hat.<p>You also seem to take away the idea that one can stand up against overpowering adversity. It&#x27;s certainly true that humanity faces difficult challenges, but those who have secular worldviews seem to easily default to hopelessness the minute their logical analysis turns up a probability of success that seems less than 50/50. Perhaps there&#x27;s something adaptive about the craziness of faith... it causes us to actually try in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity.",1403027927

Internal recruiters aren&#x27;t going to be too salesy - they have a monopoly (not always) on the job requirements at their company, and they aren&#x27;t being paid commission - whether you take the job or not may impact a bonus or performance review, but it isn&#x27;t going to get them a car.<p>The contingency recruiter, particularly one who is independent and not working for a big firm, wants you to take the job because it means a new car.<p>This is an important thing to understand. Cashiers at grocery stores don&#x27;t pressure you into buying more items, because what you buy has no discernible impact on them. Car salesmen, or realtors, care quite a bit.<p>Until companies start changing the way they engage recruiters things won&#x27;t change.

I like them a lot but didn&#x27;t know this was coming down the pipe.)<p>One thing which I&#x27;ve been regretting recently is that I only have exposure to 2 Rails codebases other than the Rails project itself, and as I&#x27;m the sole engineer on them, they&#x27;re... well, awful.  I hit the wall somewhere in the 10k or 20k LOrubyC region, and all the &quot;A place for everything and everything in its place&quot; pre-baked Rails architecture decisions started...  I don&#x27;t know if breaking down is the right word, but it became increasingly obvious that I was doing things the software did not want me to do.  To avoid certain controllers having 100+ methods I broke them into subcontrollers, used metaprogramming magic to route them all together, etc.  I&#x27;ve got about a dozen mix-ins in my Account class (with &quot;helpful&quot; names like Subscriptions, Analytics, Status, etc, such that I can never remember where Account#is_terminated_for_nonpayment? resides).  I use way too many hacks to get e.g. a change to app/models/accounts/analytics.rb to re-run both the account and analytics tests.<p>Looking forward to this book, and to any other resources from teams which built Rails applications that started to do a bit of heavy lifting.  My experience at my old company is a lot of it is just organic knowledge at places which have 10+ engineers working on the codebase for 5+ years, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve never been in that sort of environment in a Rails shop (and, ahem, may never have that opportunity).",1403027239

The name for this basic idea is &quot;High Level Synthesis&quot; (HLS).  For applications like digital signal processing, HSL is actually decent.  Having a stream of data moving through some transform is easy to express in C (and OpenCL), and easy to translate into a relatively efficient data pipeline in RTL when compared with making one &quot;by hand&quot;.  But this isn&#x27;t the only thing that is going on within the FPGA.  It is clunky and inefficient to create state machines or controllers, interact with inbuilt memory blocks, or interface with other modules not built in the HLS language.<p>Since inefficiencies cost resources, you end up trading your decreased development time through using HLS for possibly increased device costs, and some ambiguity in terms of the architecture of the hardware your synthesize.

However, there are many minds with many different specialties and the root cause is complex enough that it makes sense to divide it into individual problems. Especially since those symptoms contribute to the cause. Obesity causes joint pain and joint pain causes lack of exercise. And so it sometimes sounds silly to criticize someone for just dealing with joint pain rather than the larger problem.<p>But it now sounds like you are actually saying &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t forget that there are also other problems to solve here.&quot; And this is very true.",1403026886

If the server is compromised in the meantime, you are not affected.  Also, you could download the extension from a source you <i>do</i> trust and then use it on websites that you don&#x27;t trust.<p>- content-controlled code / malleable runtime: End to End, as a browser extension, isolates itself from the code/content of actual websites.<p>- no RNG: &quot;CS-PRNG is available thanks to WebCrypto.&quot;<p>- secure erasure: &quot;The threat model we are trying to address discounts adversaries with physical access and users with malware outside the browser. Chrome’s design means that extensions should be safe against other extensions. Adversaries with this level of access have a plethora of attacks available to compromise data even in systems that control their memory carefully and wipe it.&quot;<p>- no secure keystore: ? (I don&#x27;t know)<p>- timing and other side-channel attacks: &quot;End-To-End requires user interaction for private operations in normal use, mitigating this risk. Non-user-interaction actions are rate-limited and done in fixed time. End-To-End’s crypto operations are performed in a different process from the web apps it interacts with. The End-To-End library is as timing-aware it can be and we’ve invested effort to mitigate any exploitable risk.&quot;",1403025717

7905604,comment,7903043,7904181,3,0,klibertp,,,"> Maybe this is just me being stuck in my ways...<p>Probably.<p>By default Emacs is passable Elisp IDE and nothing more, really. Sure, it has a bunch of neat (disabled by default, mostly) built-in plugins (also tetris and doctor mode), but its main strength lies in how easy it is to extend and customize it. With plugins you first promote Emacs to absolutely outstanding Elisp IDE, then you get beautiful Elisp stdlib (strangely missing from core distribution) and from that point onwards you&#x27;re already in editor heaven, because you can very easily install and modify every conceivable piece of functionality.<p>Right now I have 143 packages installed with package.el, about 30 packages installed via git (and cedet via bzr, I also build Emacs from bzr repo for ease of dumping it), 3051 lines of my own Elisp scripts, one package I installed from package.el but later rewrote  completely (fuzzy-find-in-project, another 423 loc), another 254 loc in custom-set-variables and dependencies on thousands of lines of Python, Ruby, JS, Clojure, C (for example the-silver-searcher, among other more standard tools) and others.<p>The thing is, I&#x27;d probably have exactly the same Emacs config as you instead were it not for package.el. It&#x27;s a scary thought for me now - going back to vanilla Emacs (I sometimes use Zile instead of Vim on remote machines) feels like I reverted to using notepad.exe, the difference is just that great. Without an easy way to install and experiment with packages I would probably install manually a few plugins I <i>knew I wanted</i> (because I used them before in Vim) and I wouldn&#x27;t have moved forward at all.<p>For example, there is this wonderful info+.el by Drew Adams. Take a look at its Emacs Wiki page - to install it you need to manually download and require some 5 files (which is good, modular design and should be encouraged) which is a pain by itself. I probably wouldn&#x27;t install it out of laziness. Then I&#x27;d never read absolutely fabulous Emacs, Emacs Lisp, Org Mode or Fugitive (cover to cover!) Info manuals, because really, documentation in black-and-white without syntax highlighting just isn&#x27;t my thing any more (my eyesight getting worse and all). In effect, my Emacs would still be <i>just</i> Emacs instead of being <i>MY</i> Emacs, and I&#x27;d probably left it sooner or later (but now I&#x27;m being vendor-locked-in with myself being a vendor for most part, which is kind of scary too ;)).<p>The Emacs I use beats Sublime in terms of features easily and has - after a year of using it - literally thousands of little (and bigger) functions which make me more productive, more comfortable, better informed and plain happier than I&#x27;d be with vanilla Emacs. And it was package.el which enabled me to make my Emacs like this.",1403025164

If the parents never found out about the child spending the money, then the blame would not fall on them. However I don&#x27;t consider this a very likely scenario not only because money doesn&#x27;t tend to vanish into thin air, but because a responsible parent would monitor their child&#x27;s spending. They might be able to get away with it for a while, but eventually they&#x27;ll find out. If they gave them a $5000 check then they can&#x27;t just forget about it, it doesn&#x27;t magically vanish from under their noses. Even if they do just give the check and forget about it, it is again, <i>their fault and theirs alone</i>. They caused the scenario in which they couldn&#x27;t monitor the child&#x27;s spending. They can&#x27;t assume the child will act responsibly; they need to monitor their spending.

There&#x27;s iron but the plants can&#x27;t use it above pH 7 or so.  Very much like dehydrating in an ocean, plenty of H2O just can&#x27;t adsorb it from the seawater.  So most iron problems in the USA are actually pH problems causing a lack of iron not a lack of iron itself.  So most commercial &quot;iron fertilizer&quot; etc is something to acidify the soil and only a little actual iron sulfate.<p>It takes VERY little iron sulfate to provide the required iron for soil.  It takes a lot of stuff to drop the pH a point or two.<p>If you research this you&#x27;ll find that fixing iron deficiency in the USA caused by excessive use of certain fertilizers and it is REALLY EXPENSIVE and labor intensive because most of the money is blown on fixing the pH to make the plentiful existing iron available.<p>In the unlikely even you&#x27;re low on actual iron in the soil, iron sulfate is ridiculously cheap and it doesn&#x27;t take much, like a spoonful per 100 sq ft, so a $10 bag should be something like a lifetime supply for an entire village...<p>Also some fertilizers are good iron sources so supplementation is not necessary or even a good idea.<p>Given where I live banana cultivation isn&#x27;t a serious issue so I don&#x27;t know how bananas and their fertilizers interact WRT soil pH.<p>The TLDR is don&#x27;t confuse soil pH repair with Fe supplementation (especially since one costs 100x more than the other) and iron may not even theoretically be a possible problem depending on local fertilization practices.",1403024579

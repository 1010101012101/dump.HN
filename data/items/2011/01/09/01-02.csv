2084565,comment,2083723,2084084,0,0,saurik,,,"1) a/b: The original poster explicitly stated ""on Apple's open source website"", to which I also explicitly limited my statements.<p>1) c: Unfortunately, this is not generally true: Apple keeps an internal fork of WebKit that has numerous abilities not in their public trees, which happens to be why Android and WebOS both have totally incompatible mechanisms for adding multi-touch support to JavaScript despite iOS having been out with that functionality for years prior.<p>To be quite explicit, I dare you to find and recompile WebKit for iOS. Mobile is where all the action is these days, and Apple knows that: deal with it.<p>2) All but one of the previous gcc contributors from Apple are no longer allowed to read the gcc-patches mailing list, and they are also not allowed to work with any code from gcc 4.3+: Apple is now permanently locked at gcc 4.2 and cannot even backport changes from gcc 4.2.2 (as this was re-marked as GPLv3 when it was released). This is a serious /serious/ problem for Apple, as they /need/ a compiler.<p>3) I don't understand in the slightest why improvements to the debugger, an external analyzer, or better syntax completion in the IDE, have anything at all to do with the core compiler.<p>4) I'm sorry, but this has been my impression as a toolchain integrator and distribution vendor. LLVM, which only even supports two platforms (although having seriously broken semi-support for ARM) is often stated to be ""catching up"" in correctness to gcc, but is not there yet. The opinion that LLVM is somehow epic is something you only hear from incredibly pro-Apple developers. I mean, even Apple's port of gcc explicitly chooses incorrect results occasionally for performance (an interesting specific case being ___divdc3).<p>5) It is in ""final final final draft"". Meanwhile, even for C++, Clang doesn't totally work yet. Until just a couple months ago, Clang's website claimed the following:<p>> However, the implementation of Clang C++ is still somewhat immature, with remaining bugs that may cause compiler crashes, erroneous errors and warnings, or miscompiled code.<p>AFAIK, this situation has not changed since then, and my attempts to use it recently have, in fact, been met with the compiler crashing out instead of generating any code at all.",1294538145

Let's look at this from the point of view of the user of your app.<p>Your user sees a 2Mbps (assuming you meant Mbps not MB/s) connection. That's a very narrow band for a Web server. Typically, Web servers push much more data to the users than they receive (GET vs POST ratio). The 16Mbps upload (again from the users' pov) matters little unless your users upload much more than they download from your app.<p>Think of it this way: most content from your Web server is served out to your users using the 2Mbps (GET). This is why cable/DSL is not well suited for running Web servers. But if you still insist on hosting this yourself ask Comcast for an increase of the upload band (to least 10Mbps).<p>Let's do some rough math:<p>640kb (~80KB average size) * 10000 (reqs) / 3600 (1hr) = 1.7Mb/s or 2.0Mbps including protocol overhead<p>Let's say your app goes viral and assume you get 10000 hits in a period of 10 minutes:<p>640kb (~80KB average size) * 10000 (reqs) / 600 (10mns) = 10Mb/s or ~11Mbps including protocol overhead<p>You might be able get away with this if you offload all static files to a CDN.<p>Regards<p>Joe",1294537870

Trying to build in completely new directions becomes both necessary and difficult.  Buying a startup is often cheap compared to trying to fork an existing team to build new things.  Furthermore, the startup's business model is already partially proven by time of acquisition - so they are buying some certainty compared to assigning a team to generate new ideas.<p>Another hypothesis is that with the resources of a large company behind it, the startup may grow very fast.  Adobe seems to be good at this.  Other companies don't seem as good at managing post-acquisition.<p>I have never been in or acquired by a large company, however, so what I say should come with a grain of salt.",1294536208

7538431,comment,7525198,7538043,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"The comparison between interracial marriages doesn&#x27;t impress me: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7534146"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7534146</a><p>> Civil marriage is about two people deciding to form a partnership together<p>A marriage has traditionally been understood to be a partnership between a man a woman. Do you deny this? Yes, I&#x27;m aware of the muddled and unsavory history of the institution of marriage. But it most recently has been understood to be a partnership between a man and a woman. Society&#x27;s views are evolving, as it has done in the past. But those who would prefer to keep the traditional understanding are not hateful monsters.<p>>The rational basis test requires that laws have a... rational basis.<p>That&#x27;s not what it means (according to links you provided regarding the &quot;rational basis test&quot;). Its simply a question of whether the government has a basis/interest in the law in question. It&#x27;s analogous to a jurisdiction test. The government certainly does have an interest in defining marriage since it confers certain benefits. To claim the government has no rational basis for defining who can receive tax benefits is highly suspect. It&#x27;s also rather strained to reference one opinion from one court as the final word on a matter when there have been other opinions that did not claim a rational basis exclusion. Clearly, this isn&#x27;t obvious or settled in any way.",1396731554

When a player issues a command, such as &quot;Build Unit X&quot;, it sends it to every other player to run a couple ticks ahead (how far ahead is based on average lag or whatever). If anyone performs differently, then a de-synchronization occurs and the game is over.<p>It&#x27;s explained much better here <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3094/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3094/1500_archers_on_a...</a>\n&quot;Because the game&#x27;s outcome depended on all of the users executing exactly the same simulation, it was extremely difficult to hack a client (or client communication stream) and cheat.

Cheating to reveal information locally was still possible, but these few leaks were relatively easy to secure in subsequent patches and revisions. Security was a huge win. &quot;",1396731471

He doesn&#x27;t seem to enjoy it much (although that may be more of a sarcastic tone). I think we need more devs who do it because they want to accomplish something particular, and less devs who are doing it <i>cause computers are kewl</i> (or to get paid for that matter). With a utility view, the choice of low-high level gets less emotional:<p>* high-level is more productive in the short run, but may hinder you in the long run<p>* mid-level (C-ish level) tend to be more portable and more future proof<p>* low-level will probably give you better resource usage (speed, memory etc), but not necessarily these days<p>Personally, I find C++ (plus open source libraries) gives the best trade-off, but that&#x27;s probably dependent on the task (I do audio/video analysis/synthesis).",1396730620

Some concepts are quite practical and others are theoretical, but all of the examples below taught me -- as someone who had started programming when he was 12, back in the DOS era -- something new.<p>- Data structures. I had played around with them myself before I went to university, but being formally introduced to the concept of data structures: lists (Queues, Linked Lists, Stacks); trees (Binary, B-Trees, Heaps, etc.) and the performance characteristics of each and how you would apply them. In my university it was first taught with mathematical notation followed by practical implementations in Pascal.<p>- Learning Prolog in my first year. An entirely procedural language that uses back tracking to &#x27;solve&#x27; relations based on rules and facts. I loved this class. Prolog&#x27;s not terribly practical but it taught me a lot about abstract data types and &#x27;recursion&#x27;. The idea that a list is defined as a head (the item in a list) and the tail (the rest of the list) which can be iterated over recursively was a major eye-opener to me, an until then hobbyist coder.<p>- Haskell. A stark contrast to Prolog and Pascal, I learnt the power of composability and the ability to capture complex ideas with very powerful constructs and a very strong type system. The language is lazy so you can operate on infinite &#x27;streams&#x27; of items which is another interesting way of thinking about the theory of computation.<p>- We were taught how to specify a PDP-11 (RAM banks, CPU, I/O) using an academic language that uses &quot;rewriting logic&quot;. It was a very theoretical yet practical way of specifying a computer using only mathematical principles. The idea that the number 0 and the successor function is all you need to define the natural numbers and, combined with recursion, basic arithmetic was again the sort of thing you never ever do outside University.<p>- Compilers. I wrote compilers using lex and yacc. I have used that theory -- and the theory of regular languages -- to great effect since then to formally construct grammars and parsers for tasks I needed later on in life. And I could do it effectively and efficiently without reinventing the wheel or coding myself into a corner -- which is easy to do with compilers.<p>- Computer graphics. Basic convolution filters; image processing and the general theory of 3d graphics.<p>- Graph theory. When I first took it it seemed utterly &quot;useless&quot; but it has since then been one of the most useful things I know. I grasped the concept of Git right away thanks to that knowledge.<p>- Operating systems. Networking. Basic security. Complexity theory (the study of algorithm complexity) -- and the list goes on.<p>I remember maybe 30% of what I learnt but I can quickly jog my memory or pick up where I left off. I consider my degree invaluable from an academic sense...<p>... but it did nothing to make me a better <i>developer</i>. That, unfortunately, is something you have to work hard at.

From these I build a robot, autonomous to the limit of its battery charge, which senses the temperature of its surroundings and acts on this information to move itself toward temperatures within a range its programming defines as preferable. The speed with which it does so is determined, to the limit of the motor&#x27;s capability, by the difference between the temperature it&#x27;s moving away from, and the temperature it&#x27;s moving toward.<p>If I use a cigarette lighter or a lit match to apply an open flame to one of this robot&#x27;s thermistors, it will flinch away from the stimulus as fast as it can. This is closely analogous to &quot;what we humans know to be a typical reaction to pain&quot;; if you applied the same stimulus to one of my fingers, after all, I would initially react in much the same fashion.<p>From this behavioral observation, do you conclude that my robot&#x27;s subjective experience a) exists at all, and b) encompasses the experience of pain? Does this behavioral observation inform your concept of the morality surrounding how this robot is treated by humans? Why, or why not?",1396728268

I think there's no question that Twitter is a network more oriented towards your weak ties and sources of information you think are just interesting, whereas Facebook is more oriented toward strong ties (especially given the way the News Feed ranking works).

To balance our budget, assuming no growth in spending, it would take 7 years of 5% growth. It would take 5 years at 7% growth and if we could get to 8% growth, agreed to keep the budget at 3.73 trillion, in year five we could pay 300 billion of our national debt down.

Plus there are off the shelf tools that can monitor and even dynamically repair those attacks on the fly (IPS products) and when you start using different ports those tools don't all work the same way and some won't work at all,  in that case the obscurity would actually reduce your security and reduce the effectiveness of other tools you use for security.",1298050188

I remember when some people said “man, you gotta learn Flash/JAVA, it will be the end of HTML for good”, I think Apple is laughing at them right now. Oh, and I never really learned flash, except for some little AS script skills. Point being is, technologies come and go and you either learn them or reject them. At the end of the day it’s really up to you. Do you really want to kill a bird with a bazooka , or an elephant with a mouse trap ?<p>Today however, language frameworks are the ones in the spot light, you have, Ruby on Rails; Django; Kohana, etc.. and some people just simply refuse to use it.
Why ? Well, some of them argue that in order to become a really programmer you need to know how to create a framework, you have to know how things are done.
You can agree with them, in fact, if you are learning a new language, doing things from scratch can really help you. Or can’t ?<p>It depends, are you a very good programmer ? Or a lousy one ? If you are a lousy one, chances are you will not learn anything by creating a framework, in fact it will even make you a worse one. Why ?<p>Well, a framework is a very overwhelming piece of software, it’s like building a factory for creating not just one type of product but a lot of different ones. And if the factory is not correctly build, your products will not be good, or worst case scenario, your factory won’t fit your needs in a long run.
Besides, most of this custom frameworks are created by one person, which leaves them with a lot of stuff to think of, while open source can be contributed by many, and so it can get more stable much faster. And don’t get me started on bugs and security. Also, the fact is, if you don’t comment or document your code in a year or two you will not know what your code is actually doing, and then you start to think of creating a new one from scratch.<p>I’m against creating a custom framework without being Open Sourced. Nothing against custom code of course. But call it whatever you want, but building custom code should meet a very specific purpose. Look at Facebook for instance, they’ve created their own app, hell, they even created their own PHP compiler, but because they really need it. On the other hand you have Twitter with almost 7TB of tweets per day, and they are running RoR (Or were at least). So what’s your purpose for creating your framework ?<p>In fact, I believe most of people who create custom frameworks for their own are unexperienced programmers. Why ? Most of the professionals programmers I know use or learn a framework, not because they don’t know how to code, but because they’ve all done what the framework does, and we are sick reinventing the wheel every time. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt. So why waste more time creating it ? Why not just use that time to create something meaningful, instead of worrying about ORM, Cache, template, form validations, etc. It’s old and it’s boring. I could that if I wanted, but I don’t have to, it won’t add any more value to me as a programmer.<p>If you need something more specific that a framework can’t do, do it yourself, nothing wrong about that, this is where you will learn something, because you never done it.<p>At the end, I believe that the good programmers who create their own framework are afraid of just letting go. Are afraid of stopping to worry about specific issues that their users won’t even know it’s there, like core code. It’s like they need to do that from bottom up, in order to believe that they are the hardcore-kick-ass-coders.<p>So, do you still need to create your own framework ?",1298049876

You can download and check out the contents of every available update.  Can you do that with OS X or Windows?<p>So yes, walled gardens are fine, but let users choose to get out of them.

CS industry (and the finance industry) has an insatiable thirst for deeply knowledgeable qualified Ph.Ds.

Not only is the material inside not usable for weapons,  but people trying to get the fuel out would probably be killed by a sodium fire.<p>Now there's another risk that a government could use FBR technology to construct a system for creating weapons plutonium.  For instance,  a country like Iran could use an improved version of the EBR-II with integral reprocessing to produce 'supergrade' plutonium.  On the other hand,  any country that wants weapon grade plutonium can build a graphite or heavy water and use the well-understood PUREX process.<p>It's too early to compare the proliferation risk of a thorium vs plutonium cycle.  Solid fuel thorium systems are highly resistant,  but liquid fuel systems are too immature to characterize.  If a highly effective system of protactinium removal were perfected,  it might be possible to extract weapons grade U-233 from a liquid fuel reactor.<p>Another problem with liquid fueled reactors is that it isn't easy to verify the fuel cycle.  In a solid fuel cycle,  every fuel element has a serial number,  and a random sample of them can be occasionally looked up to make sure that none have disappeared...

Your original comments weren't clear.<p>> I'm pretty sure that everybody else understood me, even if they claimed otherwise, because we're not idiots here.<p>That's your sign. =)<p>We generally aren't idiots here.  So if people are having a hard time understanding what you mean, assume the problem lies on your end and that you are failing at communicating.  Again, context is important, especially in threaded conversations.<p>> It's a cheap tactic to pretend that I'm ""incoherent"" when I am certainly not.<p>But you were.  You're believe that you were perfectly clear hinders your acceptance of that.<p>And please understand I say this with the hope of helping you see how you weren't clear.  I mean, I took the time to read your comments, which meant I had to highlight them, even though they were voted down.  I could easily have ignored them.<p>> The topic is flash.<p>Flash on the web and JavaScript, CSS and others replacing Flash.  That's the topic.  It's not <i>just</i> flash.<p>> Everybody is saying that it should be replaced.<p>Yes, everyone is saying Flash on the <i>web</i> should be replaced.<p>> Its replacements include 'X' and 'Y'. The fact that I reference 'Y' rather than 'X' is a completely natural context switch.<p>It's ""replacement"" on iOS devices is not part of the topic, for several reasons.<p>The technology being linked to is not limited to iOS devices.  In fact, it has nothing to do with Apple.  Apple, in truth, has little to do with the desire to remove Flash from the web.  However, they did put a spotlight on it.<p>So, if the technology being linked to and discussed (JS, CSS, HTML, etc) has nothing to do with Apple, but rather open standards, then it's fair to assume when you talk about proprietary devices, you're referring to iOS devices and the apps there.  This is confusing.  Flash has never been on iOS, meaning it's not being replaced.  Also, Flash isn't being replaced on the desktop either.  Flash is the one trying to be the platform to develop desktop applications on.<p>But that's mostly irrelevant, because you said this:<p>""I really don't want to be forced into paying the 50-100 percent Apple premium for hardware just because they managed to ""kill"" a technology everyone decided to hate for no reason.""<p>You won't be forced to pay Apple premium for hardware.  In fact, costs will only go down, because what is replacing Flash is open standards.  If Flash dies today, nothing changes in terms of your choice of computer to use.<p>In fact, by keeping Flash alive, you are forcing others to pay a premium.  By replacing Flash with open standards, you essentially level the playing field.<p>Anyways, this has gone on for quite a bit.",1298048579

Though so does the NTSB, so honestly I'd rather see a study done by the NTSB.<p>An automotive engineer will know how automotive companies usually design braking and acceleration systems. They can tell you if Toyota did something out of the ordinary compared to the industry standard. Assuming they didn't, the automotive engineer is no more qualified to go deeper than that than any other mechanical engineer. So bringing in a forensic engineer who knows how to deconstruct accidents is probably far more relevent than bringing in an automotive engineer who knows how to create a braking system by stiching together vendor components.",1298048530

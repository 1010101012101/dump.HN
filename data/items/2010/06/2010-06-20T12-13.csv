2) Tell founder that you are leaving in 1-4 weeks.
3) Tell him why you are leaving.
4) Tell him that he have option to hire freelancers (you are freelancer now accordingly to way he pays you) on oDesk.com, elancer.com, etc sites. He will get really good quality on these sites and in the same time these $500/wk wont be abuse to these people.<p>I mean, if you are really good, and it looks like you are, you should fight for much better compensation/results for your - you have wife and kids now!!!

On the one hand, I want to keep it short and stick to the point I'm making. The fact that you can get a refund is not directly related to the specific UI problem I'm describing, just like the ""undo"" feature in a desktop application isn't directly related to, say, mislabeled menu entries.<p>On the other hand, I try to write defensively. If an article is read by hundreds or thousands of people, there will inevitable be some people who feel that something they consider important was not included. I try to anticipate the most obvious criticisms or questions, and explicitly mention them preventively. But if I include all of them, the text will eventually become unreadable. I'm also writing for an audience of UI designers, who generally realize that I'm merely pointing out specific UI flaws, rather than making larger points about the products or companies I use as examples.<p>I probably missed the mark by not pointing out the fact that it's possible to get refunds, but I think it's not as obvious as you imply.",1277038184

I may get flamed for this view, but I don't really think it matters as much <i>which</i> framework you choose, just choose one and learn to use it well.  Invest time in to learning with it on a throwaway project.<p>You will not be as productive end-to-end on day 1 as you are with your current tools - that's OK, because after learning <i>a</i> framework, you <i>will</i> be more productive than pure hand-coding for any web-app of any complexity.  You'll likely be safer, because there's been more effort put in to most frameworks to help protect against web attacks (SQL injection in most cases).<p>Learning a framework will teach you to think differently about your development process, as well as introduce you to a community of like-minded developers all using the same tool.  It will help you <i>develop</i> a development process.<p>You'll get to the point where you're comfortable and productive, and then you'll start noticing limitations in whatever framework you're using.  That's the time to start looking for another one, and either jumping over to using that, or more ideally, looking at what ideas and components you can reincorporate in to your current tech stack.<p>I love Grails (Java) because, while it's niche, it makes model-drive development a snap.  I create classes, identify relationships, and the system can generate the db layer (tables, etc) for me automatically.  There are ways to do some of this in PHP, but the language itself makes this extremely verbose.  However... I still use PHP (now using zfkit as a basis) for some projects, and have done some .Net work where it made sense (on an MS-only project, to be precise).<p>It's easier to jump around now because I've spent time understanding not just the particular languages involved, but thinking about how web apps are commonly abstracted (MVC, service layers, db layers, etc).  Understanding those common patterns makes it easier to swap between frameworks and platforms as needed.<p>Gentle plug - I'm working on a starter kit for zend framework - zfkit.com - which aims to bring a somewhat better 'out of the box' experience to ZF (at least from my perspective).

Most people don't need to do graphically-intensive tasks, such as gaming or heavy Photoshop editing or other performance heavy tasks, i.e. things that increasingly are becoming the only reason to buy a desktop.<p>As far as gaming is concerned, I have a relatively powerful PC myself, but I still opt to use my xbox 360 for gaming as using the 360 controller over the keyboard/mouse makes it easier to dive into a game, plus I don't have to worry about install headaches, incompatible drivers/hardware, patches... etc. The 'next-gen' consoles (360 and PS3) have made many of the reasons for buying a gaming PC redundant - networked consoles over Xbox Live! and Playstation network, and advanced hardware that allows graphics and performance to approach high-end PC performance (granted you can spend a few thousand on a gaming PC that will blow any console out of the water, but that isn't a realistic option both financially and in terms of ease of use for most gamers).<p>For most of the tasks that people want to do on their PC - browse the web, email, compose word docs, skype, instant messaging - I would advise my less tech savvy relatives to buy a cheap laptop.",1277035877

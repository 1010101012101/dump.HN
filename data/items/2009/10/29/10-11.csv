As quality becomes more important, the eHow statistical analysis will demonstrate that and eHow will adjust the process to increase quality.<p>Alternatively, they might just stick to such simple topics that this is unnecessary. ""How to Be Popular"" is not a simple topic, but ""How to Use a Can Opener"" is. Using a can opener is a useful thing to have available and doesn't need expensive production values.<p>Over time, if the business is truly data-driven, it should adjust to reflect these realities and lend itself to fulfilling true human needs, not just yelling the loudest for short term profit.",1256813900

He's just taken a standard thing ""when things fall into place"", given it a catchy name and then added an almost unrelated anecdote from his life.  There's no effort to explain how to achieve ""the moment"".<p>It's probably quite well received because positive, empty generalities are upbeat and tend to attract kudos.<p>That said I can see the following ways to actually achieve those moments where everything falls into place:<p>1) Unconscious competence in something - for example leading troops - requires a long period of practice.  Hence focused practice on a field of interest should help.  Note that in the military example in the article the guy had been spending a lot of time dedicated to learning how to lead troops.  He wasn't dabbling and having a go for an hour every month.<p>2) Focused practice needs to target weak points, or at the very least different things - if you keep doing the same thing over and over you're unlikely to make any progress.<p>3) A willingness to make mistakes advances you towards competence faster (I recall a previous article on here arguing that people learn and retain much more from their mistakes than from rote learning).  Also a fear of making mistakes will keep you from trying new things and hence retard your progress.<p>4) The ability to accept and get through a long period of incompetence, keep motivated, and keep practicing.",1256811307

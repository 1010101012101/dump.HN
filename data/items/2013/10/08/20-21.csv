6517817,comment,6517567,6517567,1,0,smacktoward,,,"This article confuses me. Let&#x27;s look at the list of complaints.<p><i>Chiclet keyboards</i><p>I was skeptical of the new island-style ThinkPad keyboards too, but most reviewers who have tried them found them as good as or slightly better than the old keyboards.

Like the reviewers, I found my fears about the shift to be entirely unfounded.<p><i>Removing the buttons from the touchpad</i><p>I would think the first thing a real hard-core ThinkPad fan would do is deactivate the touchpad altogether and just use the TrackPoint nub.<p><i>Eliminating the removable battery</i><p>It&#x27;s true that the particular model he&#x27;s complaining about, the T431S, doesn&#x27;t include a removable battery. But that&#x27;s because &quot;S&quot;-model ThinkPads have always been pitched as slimmer and lighter versions of the standard model, and removable batteries add weight. You can get a removable battery with the non-slim-and-light version, the T430 (<a href=""http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t430/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t430/</a>).<p><i>loading Windows 8 without the benefit of an IPS (In-Plane Switching technology) display, let alone a touchscreen</i><p>My X1 Carbon came with a touchscreen. It worked fine with Windows 8, and even works reasonably well with Ubuntu 13.04, which I happily replaced Windows 8 with shortly after the machine arrived.<p>They don&#x27;t have a touchscreen model in the T series yet, but I have to think it&#x27;s only a matter of time. (The lag may be due in part to the notoriously slow speed at which big enterprises adopt new tech -- the T series is supposed to be the basic workhorse ThinkPad, so I&#x27;d be amazed if sales to enterprise customers aren&#x27;t a primary concern for Lenovo for that line.) Until then, if a touchscreen is a must-have, you can get one of the many other (<a href=""http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/#/?facet-5=3&page-index=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/#/?facet-5=3&p...</a>) ThinkPad models that <i>do</i> include one.",1381265981

6517808,comment,6514843,6514843,2,0,fnbaptiste,,,"Not surprised at all to see the concerts line going up in this chart. The amount of money my friends and I spend on live music is getting out of hand lately, largely because mid-sized acts can now charge big prices for tickets. I like the fact that &#x27;indie&#x27; acts now sell out shows in decent venues and can get away with charging $60+ for tickets. I think the pirating of music is making things a lot easier for those mid-sized bands to push their way into getting a decent-sized world-wide audience. I think groups like Chvrches or The Naked and Famous (both of which coming to my city in the next month, selling tickets at $60+, and likely to sell out their venues) have probably benefited a lot from the pirating of their music. I&#x27;ve never paid for either of their music, nor has anyone I know (in fact, I know very few people who still regularly pay for music at all), but most of my social circle are likely to go to one or both of those shows.",1381265879

6517765,comment,6516948,6517646,44,0,saurik,,,"FWIW, when Stripe launched they did not have any way to correlate chargebacks at all, nor did they offer separate authorization/capture phases (which is required to ship physical goods: you are not allowed to actually charge someone&#x27;s credit card for a purchase you are shipping until you&#x27;re about to actually ship the product). They also had rather weak webhook retry support (it would retry a couple times over short periods of time, if I remember correctly). They have since fixed these issues, but in the mean time their main benefits have been cloned by PayPal (easier to read documentation, and a JSON-based API that can be used from a browser).<p>Their prices were also fixed at the highest end of PayPal&#x27;s fees (2.9% + $0.30), and while they now mention you can get volume discounts, they make it clear you shouldn&#x27;t even attempt to discuss this with them until you are looking at over a million dollars processed every year. PayPal and Amazon, in comparison, list discount pricing on their websites for volumes as low as forty thousand dollars a year. Meanwhile, if your average receipt price is less than about $12, you probably aren&#x27;t even considering Stripe, because PayPal will offer the same service to you with &quot;micropayments&quot; pricing: on a $1 purchase this will save you over 20% of revenue on processing fees.<p>I have not evaluated Balanced as a payments provider (I only remember them being usable for outgoing payments, not incoming ones; is this feature new? regardless, their pricing is as high as Stripe), but for the purpose of payouts you are looking at a tradeoff: they charge $0.25 per transaction, with $1 if the payment fails; in comparison, using PayPal MassPay costs 2% of the transaction cost, but is capped at $1. If you are building a large marketplace, and end up having to do a lot of dinky payouts, PayPal is going to be more cost effective. You also will have to file less paperwork using PayPal (you don&#x27;t need to 1099-MISC someone if you use a third-party payment network, as PayPal will send a 1099-K instead, but you do if you use ACH), and will more easily be able to support international merchants.",1381265429

Follow that line back to wherever it hits the plane. That&#x27;s the equivalent point on your complex plane.<p>Play with this a bit. Points near the top of the sphere (near the cow, at infinity) will shoot laser beams way off into the distance.

Your logic is akin to suggesting that you&#x27;ll never get better at programming by building applications that you don&#x27;t sell or push to github. It&#x27;s true that exposure to a live audience presents unique challenges that sharpen your edge, but it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you&#x27;ve been up on stage if you don&#x27;t spend the lion&#x27;s share of your time refining the technical skills that produce the art. As any music fan will attest to, the stage performance is secondary to witnessing your favorite musician flawlessly assemble their headlining composition, live in front of your very eyes.<p><i>If musicians are expected to make money ONLY from touring, that is, traveling from town to town and getting up on a STAGE (not just going from town to town and setting up in rehearsal studios), they must already be really good at it. Do you not see the conundrum here?</i><p>Musicians aren&#x27;t <i>expected</i> to do anything, they should make money any way they can. Yeah, these days it&#x27;s hard to sell strings of ones and zeros for money since computers make it trivial to store and transmit those strings, but that&#x27;s the nature of reality, it&#x27;s the same reason why nobody is willing to pay a person to organize paper documents in a filing cabinet... the world has moved on. Even if we accept your assertion that you have to get up on stage in order to start making money getting up on stage, you do what everyone else does: invest in your product (your music) and take a loss till you&#x27;re good enough to start turning a profit. You don&#x27;t need a VC to be successful in the music industry, period.<p><i>When the music industry was functioning record labels would advance money for a tour in the hopes that the venture would result in more money made from record sales than it cost to keep the van full of gas and a roof over everyone&#x27;s heads for 12 weeks.</i><p>Yeah, and there was once a time where the VCs would dole out cash for every other mobile/social/local iPhone app in hopes that the venture would result in more money made from app sales than it cost to keep a van full of college students fed on ramen for 12 weeks.

These works were not a platinum hit at the top of Billboard&#x27;s charts. Heck, Bach didn&#x27;t even get <i>paid</i> for them! These compositions were sent <i>on spec</i> to the mayor of Brandenburg (hence the name) in the hope of stirring up some sponsorship so Bach could continue his work.<p>If you&#x27;re like me, you picture the hopeful rock star as struggling along, trying to supplement his income by giving guitar lessons to locals.

It is harder to sneak back doors into software that people are actually using, especially software that is widely used, than it is to sneak a back door onto a server than only a handful of people can inspect.  It is also harder to sneak in a back door when there are many, separately maintained implementations of a common protocol; you are forced to try to sneak a back door into an abstract description, which a lot of experts will be reviewing (see e.g. DUAL_EC_DBRG; the backdoor was discovered within a year of the PRNG being publicized).<p>There are also limits to what sort of back doors can be put at a lower level.  Suppose you sneak a back door into my CPU, but I am running software that was developed after you developed your back door.  You can make a straightforward computability argument that in general, your back door will be rendered useless by unexpected changes to software, particularly sweeping changes to it.<p>In any case, my point is not that encryption is a panacea, but rather that webmail is, by its nature, insecure.

In particular, Boston used to have a vibrant music scene that&#x27;s all but dried up now, and every former musician who played that scene I&#x27;ve spoken to points the finger at file sharing.<p>This is because piracy changes the economics of how the major labels behave. Before, major labels used to take risks on what they thought might be the &quot;next big thing&quot; in order to reap the profits when it does turn out to be popular -- and landing a major label contract, and the attendant fame and fortune, is what motivated many bands to get together and play. These days, however, if the &quot;next big thing&quot; is starting to show signs of catching on, that probably means its music is already pirated and all over BitTorrent, and that&#x27;s like Kryptonite to a major label. So they don&#x27;t sign that cool new band and the band has to make do with concert and T-shirt sales and word-of-mouth. And that may mean having to choose between your music and putting food on the table. To most musicians, your &quot;big break&quot; is <i>how you make a living with your music</i>.<p>It also brings the quality of music down, as now the major labels will only invest in &quot;sure bets&quot; like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, or Justin Bieber. The ones that don&#x27;t get signed to major labels either take nine-to-five jobs and stop playing, or are so in love with their music that they don&#x27;t mind being penniless hipsters. Most can&#x27;t achieve the critical mass it takes to build a large fan base, so most people&#x27;s conception of what music is is disproportionately influenced by the formulaic &quot;sure bet&quot; acts.<p>So support your local musicians.

6517448,comment,6517364,6517364,1,0,diydsp,,,"Upvoted for this critical insight:<p>>But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work.<p>This is a terrific insight and goes well with this writing by Bertrand Russell which I saw on HN earlier today:   <a href=""http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html</a>",1381262460

Although, yes, it should really be standardized though, like the JVM debug protocol.<p>The Google Web Toolkit team was looking at this; instead of their historical approach of using a JVM to run/debug user code (because that was actually a really great idea in IE6), using the native JS debuggers in FF/Chrome/etc.<p>...except that there is all sorts of wonkiness, like only 1 debugger is supported at a time, so you can&#x27;t use, say, Eclipse (whether for GWT or pure JS debugging) + FF dev tools for inspecting CSS/etc. at the same time. And you can only connect to 1 tab...something, something. I was not directly involved, but it didn&#x27;t sound pleasant.<p>Anyway, I totally agree that native dev tools should be decoupled/play friendly with other tools.<p>AFAICT, so far the FF/Chrome engineers are going down the path of basically building IDEs from scratch, in the browser itself.<p>Which was great for Firebug, and inspecting elements, but for a debugger, I really want to stay in my IDE.",1381262444

6517442,comment,6516114,6516114,1,0,RockofStrength,,,"I was thinking about Sierpinski triangles recently, and trying to relate it to the 3 4 5 triangle. The 3 side has a Sierpinski triangle, with 9 segments, equaling 3^2. The 4 side has an equivalent &quot;Sierpinski square&quot;, with 16 segments, equaling 4^2 (basically four squares touching at the corners with an empty square space in the middle, forming a cross shape). Then I was going to show how the two shapes could be combined to equal 5^2, or come up with its own shape (a house seems best, as the regular pentagon tiles the plane so the line totals don&#x27;t work out).<p>As of yet, fruitless. It&#x27;s a cute little project that shades of the standard presentation of three squares forming a center 3 4 5 triangle, with an interesting twist.",1381262426

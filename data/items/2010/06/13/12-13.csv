No correlation to quality exists imo.<p>And i agree, using pseudonyms is the only way to maintain confidentiality when for example you want what you say to remain inside a certain community. In my case, while i have no problem with the HNers knowing who i am (and would be also quite happy to meet some of you), i don't see why someone googling my name should know that i post here, none of their business.<p>Disclaimer: I skipped the original ""scary job hoppers/HN lack of civility/untested ideas to improve civility"" querelle, because not being american i don't have a clear view of the job market there and discussion about lack of civility turn out to be pretty useless usually (""it's the internet,baby."" it's usually the conclusion).\nNow i've spent 20 min or so reading marks' posts and some comment here...\nWhat i can add 10 days or so later? Not much :)<p>Generalizing in that way/posting useless rant will always attract a lot of angry comments, it's correct and it's also to be expected.

But face the facts, most of these novelties are used today to deliver the content of questionable value in a way which will make it better memes, nothing more.<p>If you look at it from a distance it's quite stupid use for such advancved technologies. I still believe in an idea that computers are here to free us from a boring repetitive work - to <i>compute</i> things for us. The outcome of it would be that average user spent <i>less</i> time by the computers, enjoying what he likes in a life instead. But today's situation is that the software industry is making users sitting <i>more</i> by the computers, because this industry is all about trading the information, memes and advertisements, luring the users into false comfort zones like social networks, ad target groups via portals and stuff like that.<p>It's just stupid. Flash loaders are just part of this counter-productive culture. Usually the more CPU they eat the less interesting the content showed afterwards is. It's like that because CPU-eating intro shows something about the state of mind of people who created it (or hired the creators) and most likely such people will not have anything interesting to show as a real content.",1276432985

You'll be working at a startup and they'll lay off the entire development team, but ask you (and only you) to come back on a contract.  You'll get a call out of the blue from somebody who's putting together a team  and got your name from one of your old bosses who recommended you.  These incidents might not mean much individually, but over a half dozen years you can assemble them to mean that you're good.<p>From there, you get something that's definitely not true of any other career (or at least only applies to a few).  Doctors and lawyers generally don't get to disappear on year-long vacations and then drop back into their previous career path without missing a beat.  Developers can.  You can go on to lead the life you want, without having to think about how it will damage your career.  It's all good from there.",1276432758

1427349,comment,1427054,1427133,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"What this article does successfully through hyperbole is to remind us to add opportunity costs into evaluating the value of an education.   Your quibbles about the obviously rough numbers don't subtract much from that key point. It obviously doesn't make sense to abandon education, but it also obviously doesn't make sense to pay $500k for it.<p>""That the current salaries of recent college graduates represent their probable average output over their lifetime.""\nIt doesn't represent that at all. It is saying that the value due to education can be roughly approximated by the starting salary. The gains from there are then more based on experience/work, not the education.  Of course, you ignore the money made while you would have been in school. You also ignore the periods of unemployment.<p>""I don't believe that the complete value of the education is in its utility for the labor market.""\nThe fundamental question though is how much we should pay for it. I could read books, do ""home work"", and watch MIT lectures on the internet for a lower price.  Many people are looking for ROI.<p>""That there is a reliable way to make a ten percent return on investment overseas.""\nA rough number, but definitely too high. The world is over-invested anyway as a result of too much money having been created.<p>""And that the normal personal investment into a college education is really $300,000. This is anti-factual. It is probably also wrong that each marginal elementary schooler costs $200,000, but I can't say for sure about that.""\nI don't think it says personal investment, the distributed cost counts too. It costs about 20k per year here for elementary school and 25k for high school, to be conservative. You don't need to look at the marginal costs here, because they are your costs.",1276431844

1427346,comment,1426830,1427243,0,0,kurtosis,,,"While I believe that this advice is technically true - it avoids a very critical issue and is thus misleading.  The more important questions are: How ""good"" do you have to be to get an outcome comparable to the average lawyer or physician (or MBA grad)?  How many other people are this good?  How different are the outcomes between people who are ""good"" and those who are not ""good""?<p>You could make the same argument about playing professional basketball or football.  If you are ""good"" you won't have any problem finding work and you will make a lot of money.  The problem is that only a vanishingly tiny minority qualifies for this standard, and players that are only marginally not good enough to make it to the NBA have significantly worse outcomes.<p>Computer programming is a fun intellectual challenge. If you want a conventionally successful career study law or medicine - professions which take protecting their wages and bargaining power seriously.  Computer programming is something where you must be motivated by a love of the craft.  I remember reading Stroustroup's C++ when I was in high school and he pointed out the trend toward the ""deskilling"" of computer programming.

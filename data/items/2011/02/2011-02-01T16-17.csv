I've worked at and with 3 major search engine initiatives, and we all tested heavily against Google in a variety of ways.<p>But the article definitely gets a few things wrong. For example, having worked at Bing I can tell you this: in general ""obvious"" misspellings are autocorrected without comment. It's not some sort of magical copying procedure, it's actually a policy. Want proof? Here's an example query you can repeat: <a href=""http://fayr.am/4KdG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fayr.am/4KdG</a> (direct query link: <a href=""http://fayr.am/4JZD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fayr.am/4JZD</a>)<p>But otherwise, shit yes everyone is scrutinizing google trying to figure out what they're doing. That doesn't mean other players aren't doing their own optimizations, or even running relevancy metrics against other search engines. Relevancy is not a concept with fixed metrics, and every player in the search market does everything they can to figure out what their competitor is doing.<p>And even the raw results leakage is fairly par for the course. It's not like Bing searches are a crawl of google searches; Microsoft gets this data from browsers running this toolbar and uses it to help shore up queries where they don't return good results.",1296579158

Binding is automatic between server and client, between controls, and validation code can be written once. It also has the richest UI control library I've seen, full of controls that actually work and aren't just a shiny layer over simple code.<p>Second up is OpenLaszlo:<p><a href=""http://www.openlaszlo.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openlaszlo.org/</a><p>OpenLaszlo provides a much more raw layer for creating UX on the web, similar to the OP's complaints about not having a UIKit like API. Additionally, it provides a declarative language for laying out controls, and also provides expression binding, so you can say ""the width of this element is always 2x the height of this other one"" and the binding and event handlers are created automatically. Its declarative language is XML, so there are some nice homiconic properties you get by making it possible to return XML from a web service to generate UI elements. As a bonus, it can generate Flash or DHTML.<p>Edit: Of course, both of these frameworks have their downsides. They're horribly ugly to look at (out of the box.) The declarative language for SmartClient is really ugly Javascript, and the language for Laszlo is really ugly XML.<p>However, they've solved the hard problems and left the ""easy"" ones.

I'm skeptical that abstracting away the boundary between client and server is a good idea. Unless you're a DRM true believer, there will always be an essential difference: The server is (more-or-less) guaranteed to be running the code you wrote, and the client <i>is not</i>. In the end, unless you are comfortable with allowing an AI to dynamically adjust your application's attack surface for you, you'll always want visibility and control of what gets done where.<p><i>SEO works fine because the page can be rendered entirely server side.</i><p>Are we missing the point that web-based applications and web pages have totally different semantics? The major difficulty with getting Google to index my single-page application is not the need to run multiple rendering engines. It's that Google indexes web pages, and my application is probably not built out of web pages -- not without a great deal of creative thought, anyway. Try to imagine an iOS application that could be fully rendered for Google. How would you do that? Does each possible window and window state get a URL? How should Google index the little popups that appear when the user executes a three-fingered leftward swipe with a twist?<p>The reason why you're writing your views and rendering twice is probably that you need to design them twice. You can either make your users view your app as Google does, as a series of HTML pages at distinct sensible URLs with a minimal amount of Javascript sprinkled on top (which was good enough for 1998, and even 2008, but perhaps not good enough to compete with iOS long-term), or you can design a glorious GUI experience for your users that is largely opaque to Google, or you can do the work twice: Figure out one view of your data that appeals to humans and another that appeals to indexing bots. And that job probably can't be done for you by some magic framework. Figuring out sensible views of your data is design work, for humans.<p><i>A departure from the routing paradigm found in Rails, Sinatra, Sammy, and Backbone. The traditional one URL maps to one controller action routing table no longer applies.</i><p>We didn't converge on this routing paradigm arbitrarily. Among other considerations, it is very strongly influenced by Google, a company that literally <i>pays you money</i> if you design a URL scheme that can be usefully interpreted by Googlebots.",1296576268

However I consider it reasonable that anyone practically minded will have some of these anyway (I bought myself a set when I bought my house last year and they have already proved their worth :)).<p>The main part of the project is careful design, figuring out the exact dimensions of the pieces you need (sketchup is good for this, or graph paper). Then you can go to the nearest hardware store (I live in a medium sized town and we have at least 5 places I can go to) who will provide the wood cut to length for you.<p>The only real sawing you need to do is fiddly bits - for example I have to fit mine around skirting board at one point, so need a notch.<p>In terms of construction, that's fair easy. Wood is really forgiving to work with as long as you are sensible about it :) my design is very simple. I have a piece of wood for the base, with the sides going up to the roof - they are secured top and bottom for rigidity. On both sides I have batons secured horizontally at the intervals I want my shelves, then each shelf just sits on that.<p>If you get nice thick wood (18mm or more) and don't make the shelf length too long (i.e. about about 80cm) that will work great!<p>Pre-drill holes first - make sure you use a wood bit substantially smaller than your screw - and make sure you have decent wood screws of the right length.<p>Bookshelves are pretty simple once you have pieces of wood the right length. Cutting yourself will make it harder, but not impossible :)<p>EDIT: everything is 90 degree angles, which simplifies things a lot. I'm currently working on a plan for my desk which involves Z shaped legs :) cutting the angles on that will be fun!<p>Making furniture is wildly rewarding; particularly for me as my dad is pretty practical in terms of DIY so it's some common ground for us!",1296576216

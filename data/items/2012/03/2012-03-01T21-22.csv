3654254,comment,3651159,3653985,5,0,dxbydt,,,"There's no real argument cause these are orthogonal concerns.<p>In general, you'll have a bunch of concerns.
1. BCNF
2. ACID
3. Performance
4. Scalability
5. Ease of implementation<p>Before noSQL, you'd prioritize in that exact order.
Post noSQL, the order has precisely reversed. There used to be pricey Oracle consultants ( and Sybase consultants & DB2 consultants & so on....data architects of all stripes). They'd come in, study your data in some depth & figure out which attributes were single-valued, which ones were multivalued, which bunch went into which tables, who the primary keys & foreign keys were, what the typical views would look like, what joins would that involve & could you do away with some of those joins....hell, even the typical interview questions for a fresh grad having absolutely nothing to do with databases would still involve Outer Join, Inner Join, difference between the two, here take the Employee spreadsheet and the Company spreadsheet and decompose into tables upto 3.5NF, list all the keys & tell me how many joins you'd need for a view that lists all employees in Accounts making over 70k between the age of 35 and 45 in Illinois.
All of the above is pure relational logic. Its completely tech-agnostic. You don't even need an actual database to answer any of that.
Nowadays, the questions are more along the lines of - How do you deploy MongoDB ? Great, you're hired, cause Mongo will handle the scalability & performance & if it doesn't we'll just add another node....imo, this is a vacuous line of thought.",1330639048

3654243,comment,3653540,3653540,6,0,scopestar,,,"I have to disagree with you here. The 'row' and 'span' pieces are a small part of the overall bootstrap package. If we leave them aside for a moment (and come back to them later), I think most of the Bootstrap class names are well thought out and even ""semantically"" meaningful. If I'm going to show a button and its the primary button, I could to much worse then a class named btn-primary. Same goes for alert-warning, progress-info, page-header, etc.<p>The purpose of the library is bootstrap. I've seen much worse choices made by web sites that don't employ consistent approaches towards semantically meaningful class names then bootstrap is using. If down the road, after my ""bootstrapping"" days are done I want to overhaul my css, I can redefine, extend or whatever I want with a class named 'alert-info'. But chances are pretty good that whatever I want this alert box to look like, it is still going to be an info alert box from a semantic standpoint. I'm not really ""hardcoding"" anything. I'm using a consistent naming convention for my semantically described elements/components. Have I really accomplished anything better by giving my alert-info box a custom name of my-alert-info-box?. I argue no. If the class name was 'bootstrap-red-square-box' that would be a different story.<p>As far as row and span thing goes, you have to pick your poisons. A lot of people use grid layout systems (blueprint, 960, etc.) and most of these require some row, span, column, gutter class markup. I think people have pragmatically learned over the years that while we don't want to force layout into tables (because they have a different semantic purpose), the holy grail of 100% layout free css class names my not be worth the cost. Generally a layout change requires some markup change no matter how pure your naming is.<p>I wouldn't throw the whole Bootstrap class naming convention overboard just because of the row and span thing.",1330638857

3654234,comment,3653161,3653360,4,0,lclarkmichalek,,,"""A pretty tiny fraction of them are any good""? I really don't agree. Most every idea is pretty good, at least in a couple of circumstances. Most every idea also has very serious flaws. But that does not mean the idea is worthless. I guess the most obvious example is democracy; it has some very serious flaws, but it's the best we've got. Usually, the same can be said for any popular political philosophy; good, but with some serious flaws.<p>Also, in the vast majority of cases, both sides of the argument should be concidered. Sure ID should be dead by now, but the first time it was proposed it very definatly should have had both sides heard. Look at when evolution was first proposed as an idea. Had both sides not been heard on that idea, had it not been given it's 5 minutes, we would live in a very different world. Of course this is an example that will make many people wince, as I am comparing an evidence backed theory with pure religious dogma, but I fail to see the difference. If religious based dogma cannot be successfully argued against, then maybe some more research should be done to counter it. But until a rational/scientific argument can be formed against it, I see no reason why it should not receive its 5 minutes.<p>I disagree with you. Every time you deny an idea 5 minutes, or the time it takes to form a convincing argument against it, you are presuming guilt. It's standard that we put the burden of proof on the person proposing the idea, but just recently I've been trying to put the burden of proof on myself. If I cannot form or find a convincing argument to counter the idea, then what reason do I have not to accept it? Or if not accept it, at least give it a space in the great library of valid ideas. Maybe ""giving the idea 5 minutes"" is a bad way to look at it, but coming up with a purely rational/scientific basis for the dismissal or acceptance of any idea is a very good exercise.",1330638734

If they evaluate the market and determine that the average user is a 2GB/month type user and their network is supposed to be able to handle upwards of 7GB/month per user at their projected service rates they make the offer that ""unlimited"" is what is offered.<p>From the consumer's P.O.V. an ""Unlimited"" data plan looks much better than a ""7GB/month"" data plan. Smoke and mirrors.<p>What happens is the power users or edge cases to these hypothetical usage models break down that service offering. A lot goes into a mobile network and heavy users CAN cause issues to the equipment out in the field. What happens is the tech side of the provider begin to scramble to make things happen, project budgets skyrocket and everything suddenly looks terrible on paper.<p>The next step is then to realize that ""unlimited"" is a pipe dream and is really only available to those people who check the weather and read their emails on a daily basis.<p>/rant<p>tl;dr - its not a malicious decision by the provider to make these offerings.

In the old world, store managers would report their intelligence up the managerial chain, the upper management would try to synthesize everything, and 3 months later a ""report"" would be issued that told everyone how to best try to do their jobs. After Yammer, store managers would just talk to each other over Yammer, learn directly what was successful and what wasn't, and as a side effect, let the upper management gain invaluable visibility into day-to-day operations. When we say Yammer ""breaks down silos"" and ""enables horizontal communication"", this is what we mean. Sure, Yammer is just like Facebook, but we're so much more than that. Corporations don't share cat pictures, they turn into efficient business machines.<p>Supervalu testimonial video: <a href=""https://www.yammer.com/customers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yammer.com/customers</a>
In fact, Supervalu isn't the only company that has changed the way they work due to Yammer. We have tons of examples at that link. Yammer is used by 85% of the Fortune 500.<p>Yammer is expanding. We just raised an 85MM round, reflecting a valuation that puts on right up there in the enterprise software space. We're growing quickly and we need strong capable solid engineers to help us. We have an excellent technical platform but we need to scale more. This is where you come in. We're looking for engineers of all stripes, be it Ruby/Rails, JS/Node, Java/Scala, Obj-C/iOS/Android, or other. Again, full list at <a href=""https://www.yammer.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yammer.com/jobs</a><p>If you're remotely interested in solving real engineering problems at scale, for a serious application, I urge you to get in touch.

You show your manager, it gets approved, and now all top tier support staff is able to be more efficient at the job that takes them the most time. Iterate through this process with different GMs writing different tools, some help from the WoW dev team and other teams so that different log files are created which are easier to interpret. I can't give specific inside information, but I'll say it used to take hours to restore a hacked account but last week my wife's account was somehow compromised (we think when we used an Internet cafe to play, or possibly due to a shared passwordeither way, it took a former account investigator seeing his wife hacked before finally adding Phone Secure to protect himself) and she had an in-game mail with her lost stuff within an hour of reporting the hack.<p>So yes, the tool building was voluntary (eventually sanctioned and encouraged, even of it was unofficial at first) and that directly led to an increase in productivity (supply) which has come to a head with demand decreasing simultaneously (referring both to drops in subscription levels and, more importantly, even the long tail of WoW players being incentivized and easily able to add forms of multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts and prevent the compromises in the first place). It would be cynical to see any of these advancements (except the lower subscription numbers, of course) as bad things, but also nave to ignore that they're a large reason why the department finds themselves in a position where they're starving for work (mostly a guess on my part, based on response times to in-game support requests, coupled with interpretations of the layoff and Blizzard's official statement about it, as well as knowledge of who I knew that was affected and who I knew that wasn't).",1330636244

7285877,comment,7281870,7284959,2,0,NateDad,,,"Upon thinking about it... I think it&#x27;s actually what I said to start - neither good nor terrible.  Defining good and terrible code is easier than defining mediocre code, so we can do it by process of elimination.  Mediocre code isn&#x27;t terrible, but it&#x27;s not good code either.<p>So, what is good code? Testable and well-tested, modular, isolated, easy to read, robust, performant...<p>What is terrible code?  Well, the opposite of that, but generally there are some key indicators - code that breaks badly in edge cases, code that is impossible to read, code that entangles itself in a lot of other code, code that is hard to test.<p>So, mediocre code would be something that has some of the properties of good code, but is missing a few of the more important ones... maybe the tests aren&#x27;t fully baked, maybe there are some inefficiencies, maybe it&#x27;s a little harder to read than it could be, maybe it&#x27;s not quite as isolated from the rest of the code as one might like.<p>The difference between mediocre and bad is the number of subpar things and their severity.  If there are <i>no</i> tests, that&#x27;s bad.  If the code is horribly entangled with unrelated code, that&#x27;s bad.  If it&#x27;s N cubed time in a place where we expect to handle large amounts of data, that&#x27;s bad.  If it ignores several common edge cases that will have really bad effects, that&#x27;s bad.<p>It is subjective, but it&#x27;s not entirely opinion, either.",1393163435

However, there were two pretty glaring issues. For one, x265 sucks at dealing with gradients, resulting in horrible banding. Two, as pointed out in the OP post, x265 is <i>slow</i> - I was pitting preset veryslow against preset veryslow (used CRF with x265, bitrate-matched with 2-pass x264), and 8-bit x265 was 5-6 times slower compared to 10-bit x264.

The axes are perfectly fine in showing the actual correlation that&#x27;s present here (almost certainly due to a third common causal factor, of course).<p>There&#x27;s no really magically &quot;unbiased&quot; way of choosing axes. There seems to be a popular view recently that you should always start your axes at zero, I assume as a backlash to some graphs magnifying very small differences by choosing zoomed-in axis values that visually exaggerate variation. That isn&#x27;t really an absolute truth either, since interesting data regions are not always near zero. For example, if you graph temperature variation in different cities staring at 0 K, you can make it look like essentially all habitable cities have around the same temperature, somewhere in the range of 250-300 K give or take. Of course 250 K versus 300 K is a huge difference to human perception of temperature, while the entire range 0-200 K is more or less irrelevant when discussing weather, so starting your axis at 0 would be a poor choice. In this case that would be the biased choice, intended to visually minimize actually important variation by choosing an unreasonably low starting point for the Y axis.",1393162798

CPAN module called PGObject::Type::JSON.[1]  This module would let you effectively grab JSON types from the db, serialize and deserialize on the db query so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>The serialization and deserialization is cool, but the question is what you can do with it.  With the json functions if they become more functional, we could use JSON as an input to stored procedures, allowing arbitrarily complex data types to be fed into or out of stored procedures easily without having to serialize in tuple/array format.<p>A single, cannonical, well supported format would be huge in that it would allow you to do things with the database with extraordinary ease that are not trivial to do today.  For example, really good json support + composite types as tuple elements (including arrays of composite types) + really good indexing support should give you an ability to approximate the power (for at least some workloads) of full custom type development, without needing to go to C.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/einhverfr/PGObject-Type-JSON"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/einhverfr/PGObject-Type-JSON</a>",1393162146

Every now and again a new life-hack article will appear, and then talk about Pomodoro, then people posting links to their time saving apps. It&#x27;s a tested technique, so why not? Maybe it really will help someone today get their project shipped. It&#x27;s not the worst thing that can happen around here :)<p>I like that the HN community supports constantly trying to be more productive. &quot;Building it&quot; can be hard for people, depending on their background and what &quot;it&quot; is-- and I don&#x27;t think having a sarcastic oppositional stance is going to encourage or help anyone.",1393161225

You should always want to do what you are doing; not necessarily in the sense that this is what you would like to be doing for the rest of your life, but in the sense of recognising that this unpleasant task will get you closer to that something you would like to do the rest of your life.<p>I think the best method to get something done is to first have a clear vision and passion for the bigger picture. Then, understand how this unpleasant task gets you nearer to the goal of that bigger picture that you want. If it does, you won&#x27;t need to ignore your feelings. On the contrary; your feelings will push you to do it. If it doesn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s a good chance you should be doing something else.",1393160735

7809284,comment,7806908,7808065,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"> there are exceptions like Java<p>Actually Java works in the same way; the confusion stems from imprecise use of jargon. Java tends to use the word &quot;type&quot; for things which would more precisely be called &quot;tags&quot;. Tags are the run-time information which distinguish different values of the same type, and can&#x27;t be erased in general.<p>Java adds a bunch of rules about handling tags, for example object values have a &quot;class&quot; tag; class tags must be statically specified (AKA &quot;type signatures&quot;); class tags can be pattern-matched automatically (AKA dynamic dispatch, method overloading and inheritance), allowing functions to be defined in separate chunks (AKA methods); functions can only be applied to arguments which will match a pattern (AKA &quot;type checking&quot;), etc.<p>These rules are checked at compile time <i>as well</i> as the types. Unfortunately all these different concepts tend to be grouped under the umbrella term &quot;type checking&quot;, which makes fine-grained discussion and comparisons to other languages more difficult.",1401274767

7809170,comment,7809024,7809024,4,0,rjknight,,,"There is definitely a need for private APIs that normal apps cannot use - they might have security implications, for instance.  The App Store or Settings apps clearly need to be able to do things that other apps cannot do - for instance, any app that had the same privileges as the App Store would be able to install/uninstall other apps.<p>Further, Apple&#x27;s position is that the App Store, Settings etc. are akin to natural monopolies - it only ever makes sense to have one of each.  The fact that it&#x27;s not possible to implement a third-party Settings app isn&#x27;t a problem because nobody should ever need to do this.  This is arguable, but it&#x27;s an easily defensible position for Apple and most iOS users would be happy with this (and those who aren&#x27;t can jailbreak).<p>Having private APIs that are available to apps like iBooks, when competitors to iBooks exist, seems a bit shadier and much closer to the example of Microsoft Office using hidden/unpublished Windows APIs in the 90s.  iBooks isn&#x27;t some essential system service, and should be replaceable by a third-party app according to user preference.  If Apple are making it even slightly more difficult for a third-party app to replace iBooks then this would appear to be anti-competitive.<p>IANAL, but I doubt that there is a legal case to answer.  However, there does seem to be a moral case to answer.  Sure, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s product and they can do what they like, but we have seen what happens when essential software vendors do what they like, and it&#x27;s generally not pretty.",1401271920

UIPopoverController is a relatively boring UI element which it&#x27;s not too complex to implement by hand, and there are a bunch of open replacements. It was also only relatively recently (Lion?) introduced into MacOS. If they are trying to find a competitive advantage here, they&#x27;re not doing a good job of it…",1401271649

7809145,comment,7809024,7809086,6,0,w0utert,,,">> <i>Stuff like this is expected and only logical, as wrong as it may be</i><p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I really don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; about Apple using private API&#x27;s and workarounds that are not available to 3-rd party apps. I also don&#x27;t see how this is different from about every other piece of commercial software in existence, the Windows API is well known to be full of undocumented API&#x27;s that are only used by Microsoft, for example.<p>The only way I could interpret a commercial vendor using private API&#x27;s unvailable to third party applications as &#x27;wrong&#x27; is if they secretly use them to gain a competitive advantage over third-party vendors of competing applications. This is clearly not the case on iOS, because the whole system is already locked down, and publishing applications directly competing with Apple stock apps is explicitly disallowed in the submission guidelines. Whether you agree about that is a different thing, but there&#x27;s nothing secret about it.<p>As far as I can tell, there also is no pattern whatsoever of Apple applications somehow using magic killer unicorn features that are unvailable to third-party apps. Did anyone ever get the impression that third-party apps on iOS are second rate compared to stock apps? I surely haven&#x27;t, I&#x27;d even go as far as saying it&#x27;s the opposite. Also the list of app bundle exceptions that can use UIPopoverController is so small, I expect there&#x27;s a much simpler explanation here. Most likely UIPopoverController does not work reliably on iOS, except in some restricted use cases, and Apple chose to disable it for third-party apps to prevent applications with broken user interfaces or having to support UIPopOverController use cases they didn&#x27;t intend to be used on smalls screens.",1401271370

They are made believe in their MBA classes that if they have a brand name and atleast one successful product they will never need any technical talent to run the company. And they can sell anything every after with operations tuning they teach them during their MBA classes. And that they can virtually sell anything by marketing, advertising and brand positioning. And that engineers and technical staff is merely a commodity which just needs to be used like raw material to convert it money later.<p>They are basically in for cashing on pre-IPO gold rush.<p>For me this is more than sufficient to be cautious before working at any start up again.",1320987397

Tribal Crossing is looking for a strong software engineer to lead the future development of our backend game engine, refine our custom system for expressing game logic and flow, and develop new games from the planning stage to post-launch.<p>What we're NOT:<p>* We're NOT working in a sweatshop making clones of Zynga games<p>* We're NOT making reskins of Evony, Kingdoms of Camelot, Atlantis, etc<p>* We're NOT letting metrics rule our lives (Star Wars wasn't created through metrics)<p>What we ARE:<p>* We ARE making games that are focused on delivering amazing story lines<p>* We ARE creating characters that players will care about<p>* We ARE building tools that will allow allow content creators to do 1 and 2<p>Why You Should Apply:<p>* TECHNOLOGY: We embrace cutting edge technology if it saves us time in the long run. Ask us about how we wrote our own DSL that in turn generates code for serializing game data and defining API routes. Or perhaps watch our webinar with Membase about how we are able to support millions of users with NO sysadmin and a tiny team. Bigger doesn't always mean better, if you know how to use the right tools.<p>* INNOVATION: We have built a wide range of tools and processes that greatly reduce both low level work and endless cross-functional meetings. By making sure team members are unblocked and focused on high value activities, we're able to spend more time on adding innovation to our games.<p>* IMPACT: We've signed some long term deals with publishers that want to distribute our games on the web and mobile platforms. We are looking for folks that want to join on this initial traction and help take it to the next level. We will be asking for your opinion so be ready to have one.<p>If that sounds interesting, you should apply here: <a href=""http://www.tribalcrossing.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tribalcrossing.com/jobs/</a>",1320987324

Does it relate to the service?<p>- The only text on the landing page is ""enter a bunch of URLS, create a beautiful collection"" so I take it that is supposed to mean something, but I have no idea what.  A collection of what?  Why would I do this?  Pretend your user has never landed on your site before and has no idea why they should use your service (hint: they haven't and they don't).<p>- In the collection, why would I want to enter a title?  This makes me think that maybe I'm supposed to share my collection with other people, but I'm not sure.  Can they change the title as well?<p>- Nice touch with the edit-in-place for the title, but it didn't work as expected.  I realized on the third attempt that I have to press ""enter"" to save the title.  I expected it to post on blur, else it should hint that I'm supposed to press ""enter"".<p>- Tell me why I should share my collection with other people.

I was at a tech conference in the late 00&#x27;s where I heard a VP (of Engineering?) from MySpace give a talk about the site&#x27;s architecture. This was probably 9 or 9:30 in the morning, and—I swear—he must&#x27;ve been totally coked up.

9159540,comment,9158089,9158089,0,0,Animats,,,"Google has, in the sense that quantitative finance people use the term, &quot;burned&quot; their data.  That is, they&#x27;re using statistical methods to extract signal from noise, and they&#x27;ve done this so much that they&#x27;re nearing the noise threshold.  When a data set is over-analyzed in this way, the impact of irrelevant data items becomes excessive.  That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here.<p>Search spam detection has improved over the years, but it&#x27;s fundamentally aimed at detecting sites that &quot;look like spam&quot;.  In response, search engine optimization has become more about making clickbait sites look less like spam, even to humans. It&#x27;s now hard to tell a clickbait journalism site, one filled by low-paid article rewriters, from one that has actual reporters. (Business Insider is owned by the founder of DoubleClick.)  Looking at the superficial properties of a site is no longer a reliable spam indicator.<p>The big search indicator used to be links. That&#x27;s what &quot;PageRank&quot; was about. Links stopped working because most links to business sites now come from social media and blogs, and those are really easy to spam.  Anyone who runs a blog now can watch the phony signups and posts come in. There&#x27;s a whole industry selling phony Google and Facebook accounts for SEO purposes.  Google has responded by disallowing many sources of links, with the result that the remaining link data is sparse for many sites.<p>Google isn&#x27;t looking at the business behind the web site.  Here, Auto Accessories Garage sells auto parts. Find the business behind their web site, and you can verify that they are in the auto parts business. Their site is full of auto parts. Therefore, not spam. Google doesn&#x27;t do that.  That&#x27;s why they failed Auto Accessories Group.<p>At SiteTruth, we look at the business behind the web site. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re able to find out for Auto Accessories Garage.[1]  This is the internal details page; users rarely look at this. We give them a good rating.  We didn&#x27;t, unfortunately, get a proper match to corporate records because their corporate name is Overstock Garage, Inc.  (We don&#x27;t have a full D/B/A business name database for dealing with such problems yet.) SiteTruth picked up the Better Business Bureau seal of approval on the site, cross-checked it with the BBB for validity, and noted the &quot;A+&quot; rating there.  Not a spam site.<p>The process is completely transparent. The link below lets you see all the data SiteTruth looked at for Auto Accessories Garage. Because it&#x27;s checking against hard data from external sources the site can&#x27;t control, there&#x27;s no need to be mysterious about how it works. There&#x27;s a vast amount of data available on businesses. If you tap into Dun and Bradstreet (we can do this, but can&#x27;t turn it on for public viewing by free users) you get in-depth financial data on companies. That allows real supplier evaluation, far beyond what Google can do.<p>The SiteTruth approach does a good job on real businesses that sell real stuff. There are objective measures for such businesses - revenue, years in business, BBB ratings, even credit data.  Google doesn&#x27;t use those, and Google fails real-world businesses because they don&#x27;t.<p>If you want to try looking at SiteTruth ratings, try our browser add-on from &quot;sitetruth.com&quot;.  We put
those ratings on search results from Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.  Now on Firefox for Android, too.

Short answer to your question is liability. If you can meet the requirements of &quot;qualified investor&quot; then the club has no liability if you lose all your money. They can say &quot;Hey, before you invest you should know you might lose all your money.&quot; and you say &quot;Ok, here is $1,000&quot;. If you lose all their money, even if you did stupid things with it, they are unable to sue you to recover it[1]. Recent changes have made is possible for non-qualified investors to participate but the rule making on that is incomplete (much to the irritation of places like WeFunder no doubt).<p>So your Father might not do this with his friends, if they were not qualified investors and he was, because if the friends lost money they might choose to sue your Father to cover their losses and they would have a decent shot of winning that case. At the very least it would cost your father a lot of time and energy and probably wipe out any gains at all the project came up with, or worse amplify any losses.<p>So to put together your $50k neighborhood investment club is simple if your tolerance for risk is high, and harder if you don&#x27;t want to be sued by the other members. A simple partnership can often work (liability is spread around to everyone) but consult competent legal counsel before proceeding. Investing in real estate and then structuring it as a landlord deal gives you a level of protection between the investment group and the tenants, that can be handy if you get bad tenants.<p>[1] Caveat that anyone can sue anyone, and there are gross negligence issues that have carve outs, but <i>generally</i> it shields the partnership from liability.",1425675207

I&#x27;ve been there and I&#x27;ve supported others going through this as well.<p>The way I overcame it was to become prepared- I would start my day a few hours early, that kept my mind sharp and gave me plenty of time to start tackling problems ahead of everyone else.  I also used my free time wisely to continue educating myself.<p>After 6 months of this, my comfort level improved tremendously- I went from being a complete novice that was way over his head to a very respected developer on the team. Stress absolutely kills my productivity so it was critical for me to understand the triggers that created it.  Once I was confident in my skills and realized that struggling is a natural part of the learning process, my mental state improved dramatically.<p>I also want to mention that I have ADD.  I need to force myself to focus on a single task or else I get overwhelmed.  I also need to have headphones on to block our my surroundings (check out windy, sunny and thunderspace iOS apps).

Are you saying part of the reason you fired them was because you weren&#x27;t a capable manager, and didn&#x27;t identify ways to keep a valuable asset as the company changed during growth?

Because honestly, that doesn&#x27;t sound good without further context. I don&#x27;t believe in union-style loyalty where the first five years entitles someone to the next thirty, but I do believe someone who helped shape the company and generated a lot of value for you deserves more than &quot;well, we&#x27;ve changed, and you don&#x27;t fit any more.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s par for the course that you can write introspection like this and reflect on your shortcomings as a manager, after culling those with similar shortcomings who have now been asked to leave the company they helped build from early days.

They should both be replaced by a license which is simply silent on the issue: a license which simply forbids the redistribution of the Work in such a way that it is combined into a single image with incompatibly-licensed works, but permits every conceivable use.<p>By the way, I think even static linking is fair, if the program is distributed as separate images, and only linked as a part of use. (Which is why the LGPL is silly.)<p>That is to say, suppose we have a &quot;Libbash&quot; library version of Bash. I could ship my program such that when the user installs it and runs its wrapper program, it statically links itself prior to execution. If it finds a &quot;libbash.a&quot; on the system, then it statically links that. Otherwise it falls back on linking to its own &quot;libbash-stub.a&quot; which works by spawning a process. Since I didn&#x27;t redistribute any part of Bash, I cannot possibly be infringing on any copyright.<p>According the LGPL (if that were the license), I would be infringing because of the specific linking technology that is identifiable as &quot;static&quot;. (Though it is <i>de facto</i> dynamic by being delayed as long as possible, happening on the user&#x27;s target machine).<p>Yet note how the user has full rights over &quot;libbash.a&quot;. The user can update to a new version or make local modifications, and rebuild this.

Cringely wrote that if you think of a market as an invasion beach you can think of three kinds of employees at tech companies: commandos, infantry, and police.<p><i>Commandos</i> are people who love challenges and hate structure. They&#x27;ll happily take on missions that other people think are crazy or impossible, because doing things other people think are crazy or impossible is what turns them on. They get you your critical early beachhead by swimming in at midnight with a knife in their teeth and slitting throats till morning.<p><i>Infantry</i> are what most people are. Most people are not Rambo; crazy suicide missions don&#x27;t turn them on. But at this point you have your foothold on the beach, so suicide missions are few; what you need now is lots of people to take that foothold and widen it into a big enough space to sustain yourself on indefinitely. This work is kind of a grind, so it doesn&#x27;t appeal to the commandos, who start falling away looking for a new beach to storm. But it&#x27;s critical for turning the company from a proof-of-concept into a real, going concern.<p>Eventually the fight for the beach ends, and the battle moves inland. But you still need to have some people there to maintain order, which is where the <i>police</i> come in. Police are even more risk-averse than infantry; they&#x27;re caretakers who see their job less as expanding the market the commandos and infantry have won then as making sure it doesn&#x27;t fall apart. Commandos and infantry fight to win; police fight to <i>not lose.</i><p>All of these personality types are important at varying stages in a company&#x27;s life, he writes, but the big challenge is making sure you have the right ones at the right stages, and that you manage the transitions between those stages well. A mostly-commandos startup that takes off but tries to still keep itself mostly commandos will choke on its own success. A larger company that still has growth opportunities but phases out its infantry in favor of police too early will miss those opportunities and get ground down by more aggressive competitors. A company that&#x27;s grown as much as it can grow but resists bringing on police will run itself down launching futile new products that the market isn&#x27;t asking for. Etc.",1425673918

A later gives C a certificate, signed with the appropriate private key, for each role on B to which it is delegating access to C.<p>C then presents the appropriate certificate to B with any operation, proving that it has been authorized.<p>(You can do this with just one certificate for each A->B and A->C->B if you identify the roles within the certificate, which is technically doable within X.509 but I think requires going through IANA to get official identifiers for each role to be delegated -- these would be identified in the certificate A gives to C to present to B -- which may or not be practical.)",1425673774

The out-of-pocket will be more expensive, because your employer probably covered some of the premium cost.  However, the premium as a whole is often cheaper than &quot;individual coverage&quot;, since the company negotiates lower premiums with the insurance company.<p>The company will typically mail you the form to fill out.  It&#x27;s pretty short, basically just a &quot;opt-in&quot; box to continue getting health insurance through the company&#x27;s plan.<p>One important detail: depending on your employer, health coverage probably ends on the last day of employment or the immediate end of the next month. However if something happens between you leaving and you filling out the form, COBRA still covers you because the law states that as long as you sign up within 60 days, it&#x27;s &quot;retroactive back to the event&quot;, the event being you leaving [2].  This covers the case of a catastrophe happening in the gap, e.g., getting hit by a car between the event and you mailing in the form.<p>Caveat: IANAL, so always check with a legal professional when evaluating these options. But COBRA is generally a useful thing and I typically recommend people take it unless they have another gig lined up already.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1985"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Omnibus_Budget_Rec...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-consumer-cobra.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-consumer-cobra.html</a>",1425673145

I agree with this statement, and I believe it to be wrong. Not incorrect, which would say that I thought it was false, but wrong in that it does people a disservice to themselves when they construct their self-identity in this way.<p>My wife is a software engineering manager, my wife is a home maker. Both true (not simultaneously) and both interpreted wildly differently externally. We were fortunate that when we had kids, either one of us could choose to stay home while the other continued to work, she opted to be that person. And she took some external heat for it from her peers, but it wasn&#x27;t part of her self-identity. Looking back on that choice, pretty much everyone who knew us then and now understands that it was a better choice than that of continuing to work, however they are split nearly evenly on whether or not I could have done as well being the primary interface to the kids during their most formative years :-).<p>It sounded from reading Zach&#x27;s essay that he didn&#x27;t know if he should take it personally or not, but came around to realizing that he should not. That is a good thing and it will serve him well going forward. I think that is a great message.

So suppose that we are given a countably infinite set of variables and told that each integer is denoted by at least one of these variables, and then further given a function over pairs of variables f(x,y), such that f(x,y) = 1 if x and y differ by less than 3 and = 0 otherwise. Then, yes, we can figure out which variables are exactly identical to which others.<p>However, I would regard this as irrelevant scenario in the sense that we could never know, via observation, that we had obtained such a set of variables (even if we allow the possibility of making a countably infinite number of observations). Suppose that we make an infinite series of observations and end up with at least one variable denoting each member of the following set (with the ellipses counting up/down to +/-infinity):<p><pre><code>    ...,0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,...
</code></pre>
In other words, we have variables with every integer value except 1 and 8. Then for any variable x with the value 4 and variable y with the value 5, f(x,z) = f(y,z) for all variables z. In other words, there&#x27;ll be no way to distinguish 4-valued variables from 5-valued variables.

If the size of the pool were to dramatically increase, either due to a more open immigration policy or improved gender balance, their ability to command their current salaries would decline.<p>It&#x27;s reasonably accepted that many American workers are against an open immigration policy, and it is is possible to voice this concern in socially acceptable ways.  I don&#x27;t know  of any socially acceptable to say the same regarding reducing the pool of competing women, but the self-benefit seems about the same.<p>Many of the proposed changes are directed at changing hiring practices, but it seems clearly to management&#x27;s benefit to have a greater pool of qualified applicants, and no particular reason to believe that they&#x27;d pass over the opportunity to hire a qualified applicant.<p>But there&#x27;s lots of reason to believe that an in-demand job holder would seek to keep themselves in this position.  This makes me think that if you want to solve the &quot;gender imbalance problem&quot; in tech, it would help to make it in the self-interest of the current well-compensated employees.<p>How would one do this?<p>[1] Interestingly, the same argument applies to women currently working in tech:  is it in their self-interest to have more women seeking jobs in tech?

I do think it is important and useful to know about it, but probably would not use it for the database sampling (as it was in the article).",1425672057

Men don&#x27;t go into sex work to the same degree because there isn&#x27;t enough economic demand for their services.<p>You missed my point.  There isn&#x27;t much demand for men as sex workers and yet they still manage to avoid starving.<p>>But it&#x27;s a mistake to generalize form your experience and assume that none are.<p>How many prostitutes do you think there are as a percentage of the total population?  In the US, especially, women have other options.<p>>Or I might infer that since poker is a game of bluffing as much as of luck, it suited at least some of your companions to present themselves to you as shiftless and lazy so as to tempt you into more reckless betting - after all, don&#x27;t prostitutes specialize professionalize in pretending to be whatever others expect them to be?<p>They weren&#x27;t working - they were playing.  Not very well, either.  This was a card club in an area that wasn&#x27;t great, and hookers and drug dealers tend to gamble a lot because they have a lot of undeclared cash.<p>>What they need is probably safe housing, maybe drug detox, counselling, education and a boatload of other resources...&#x27;<p>Well, okay, but that&#x27;s a separate issue from whether or not making her trade illegal will benefit her.  It won&#x27;t.<p>>Men are only controlled by their sexuality to the extent that they find it burdensome to obtain consent for sexual activity, no?<p>Oh, it&#x27;s not perfect control.  If a wife withholds sex from her husband for long enough he&#x27;s going to get it somewhere else, and most women are more deft than that.  But using sex as a reward for painting the garage isn&#x27;t fundamentally different than selling it.",1425672009

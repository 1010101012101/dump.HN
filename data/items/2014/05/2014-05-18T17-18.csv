For IEEE-754 math you need 3 guard digits, typically named Guard, Round, and Sticky. The trick at the hardware level is that Sticky represents the OR of a bunch of bits. Instead of keeping the full 106 bit partial product at each step you only need to keep the 53+3 bit product. As you shift+add the partial products you use special rules to keep track of the Sticky bit and you will still get the right answer.",1400435682

7763719,comment,7762868,7763512,2,0,lectrick,,,"> To get the tests working, you end up having to write a lot more infrastructure and abstraction to support it. So you end up with 6 classes where one would do, because you end up needing an extra interface, and then impl, and then mocks, and dependency injection and on and on.<p>I have found this to be true only when having to work with code that was not written with TDD.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re writing a new Rack middleware, it will be EXTREMELY easy to TDD and unit test. The entire Rack design (while not devoid of criticism) is sort of ingeniously simple and was clearly written with TDD/unit testing in mind as a design priority.<p>However, if you&#x27;re interested in TDD&#x27;ing a Rails controller without loading your entire stack... Good luck with that. But Rails was NOT written with TDD, nor unit testing, in mind. It&#x27;s evident right in the Rails lingo- a &quot;unit test&quot; in Rails is (was?) a test of the model code (and everything underneath). A &quot;true&quot; unit test doesn&#x27;t test dependencies (so for example, an ACTUAL &quot;unit test&quot; of model code would abstract out the entire database and mock out all the CRUD operations).<p>So I guess I could paraphrase what you&#x27;re saying as, &quot;If you have to TDD and, in the course of this particular development work, you have to work with code that was <i>not</i> written via TDD, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.&quot;",1400435627

That being said I also used to be a 305 pound man who became a 192 pound man on Crossfit and its concepts. I have never been a &quot;zealot&quot; but I do have some problems with this article.<p>My problems with this article are multiple, but the big glaring one which people seem to be repeating here over and over again are that Crossfit level 1 certified coaches only &quot;spend a weekend&quot;. They make it sound like these people literally came off the street never having done Crossfit before and got certified that weekend.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s true. But I&#x27;ve never met a person who took the level 1 let alone became a coach at a box that didn&#x27;t already have a good chunk of time actually doing WODs and improving from them under their belt. They have gone through the discipline in their own practice and have decided coaching that would be something useful for them. Unlike NASM where you can read a book and get certified, there is a hands-on/lab teaching component. This should be lauded. And no, not everyone is a great teacher, and the best judgment is on the community to determine if someone is working or not. (I&#x27;ve seen Crossfit instructors be dismissed from boxes.)<p>I would like the OP to quote some articles and provide some science around why the Crossfit HIIT/circuit style training is actually dangerous. I understand the concept, that when in fatigue doing additional work is dangerous, and that Crossfit encourages this at some level, but it&#x27;s always on the discretion of the participant to put the bar down, to stop doing the pull-ups, and to stop where they got to that session in a WOD. The real challenge in Crossfit is not to leave it all out on the floor, it&#x27;s to know when to stop leaving it.<p>What Crossfit does that I see a lot of personal training and individual training programs neglect are concentrations on proper mobility, warm-up, and form. And this comes from a guy who started Crossfit basically near the worst possible shape you can.<p>Another thing is I was able to study for a year+ with a multi-year Crossfit Games placing athlete, and they used Crossfit WODs to train. Pretty much exclusively. The volume was amped up for sure, but the same movements and the same formats.  Maybe the really, really successful people don&#x27;t do that? But the interviews I see with Rich Froning and Mikko Salo tend to basically say they do three workouts a day in the crossfit-style format. Metcons, endurance, strength.

In its present form it does a poor job of that, but that&#x27;s the intent.<p>Edit: I think the same logic also applies to startups, but to a somewhat lesser extent. Startups do sometimes have money, and can therefore focus on problems and employ people. But they must get revenue fast, which hugely limits their ability to play and experiment. As a result startups can innovate -- improve existing things -- but they generally cannot <i>invent</i>. Most startups that attempt to invent run out of runway and crash in the weeds. Invention seems to require a financier who is willing to throw money away, such as DARPA, NSF, etc... traditionally either nation-states or really freaking huge companies with money to burn.

For example:<p>If I make a car, you can&#x27;t just &quot;copy&quot; it. Taking the car is stealing, and I think that is immoral because you have deprived the original owner of their work.<p>If I make a short story, then &quot;copying&quot; the story means using your own pen and paper (or your own hard drive to place a sequence of bits) to copy. I don&#x27;t think this should be illegal. That is, I don&#x27;t think that having a particular sequence of bits on your hard drive should legally allow men with guns to enter your home, label you a criminal, fine you,  and/or send you to jail.<p>In that sense, not all property is &quot;imaginary.&quot; We can make a distinction between tangible property, that exists as mass, and intellectual property, which is a set of ideas/words/code/etc. Tangible property is rivalrous; we can&#x27;t both use it at the same time. Intellectual property can be used by many individuals at once, so calling it someone&#x27;s &quot;property&quot; and enforcing that claim with force creates artificial scarcity.<p>I do feel bad that people who expect and rely on IP laws could feel cheated if IP laws were to disappear tomorrow. But to pretend IP law is some sort of natural thing is a bit naive. People have been creating ideas since we evolved a brain. People will continue to create without IP law.

I&#x27;ll put in a vote for web2py as being a good tool that gets around a few of the gripes in the article. It&#x27;s largely one click to install server, editor, db, debugger etc. and was specifically designed for teaching beginners (it has versioning as well using mercurial but I wasn&#x27;t able to get that going with one click). It also does most stuff you&#x27;d need and is all in Python so you can use the libraries and rewrite bits if you can&#x27;t get the framework to do something. Even so it would take Anon a while to make his app but I think it&#x27;s some sort of progress. The creator talks about it here youtube.com/watch?v=iMUX9NdN8YE",1400434136

It&#x27;s not hard to understand why, a simple model can demonstrate it. Imagine a group of 50 people in a club or something. Imagine each of the 50 people have a probability distribution of how likely they are to prefer to listen to somebody uniformly randomly initialized. Every time a person listens to somebody, and the outcome is good, they&#x27;re slightly more likely to listen in the future, imagine that if it goes badly, they&#x27;re slightly less. Iterate on the outcome of decisions; in short order, a hierarchy will emerge, in only slightly more time, it will become very strong. (Probably even if the outcome of decisions is random, but certainly if the outcome is not, and in practice while there is always a random component there is certainly a difference in people&#x27;s abilities to make quality decisions. Oh, and BTW, the exact definition of &quot;quality&quot; is use hardly matters... &quot;decisions with outcomes that superficially look good to the rest of the club but is actually to their detriment while making me look good&quot; is a popular pathological variant, for instance. Think math here... regardless of the decision quality metric chosen, that metric will produce some hierarchy.)<p>Claiming you&#x27;re going to eliminate informal hierarchies is essentially equivalent to claiming you&#x27;re going to eliminate communication, or the eliminate consideration of the consequences of decisions made... in either case you&#x27;re creating an organization that is pathologically disconnected from reality from the get-go.<p>You&#x27;re far better off harnessing this process, guiding it, and understanding where it can go wrong and how it can go wrong, than trying to simply deny it.

7763573,comment,7762868,7762928,2,0,lectrick,,,"If you work on a team and/or on a large codebase with many moving parts, unit tests on isolated parts are pretty much a necessity (by which I mean, the hands-on observed cost of not having them vs. having them, becomes so great and apparent that it is considered necessity)<p>Secondly, system tests won&#x27;t identify the specific &quot;faulty part&quot;. Unit tests will. That can save quite a bit of time, assuming you have enough of both types of tests.<p>Thirdly, unit tests inform good component design. If your unit test is hard to write, the component under test is typically either not structured well, highly coupled to other code, or some other deficiency that will result in more bugs over time, which all become readily apparent when you try to unit test it. You will end up refactoring the code under test and it will often &quot;feel better&quot; for lack of a better description.<p>Fourthly, if all you rely on is integration/acceptance/&quot;comprehensive&quot; tests, you will have tests that run some parts of the code hundreds of times over in a test suite run, which is incredibly wasteful. For example, a workflow integration test which requires someone to log in and try various things, will have to run the login/authentication code dozens of times, when you already know it works.",1400433091

7763546,comment,7762413,7762413,2,0,eshvk,,,"Crossfit was my first introduction to Weight lifting. In that sense, I am very grateful to CrossFit. However, the process of learning form is incredibly hard. I went to one of the best Crossfit boxes in SF and while I have complete faith that they did emphasize good form, being overwhelmed by the number of new things I had to learn while maintaing good form was too much for me. This came to a culmination where I hurt my knee while doing fast reps of deadlifts.<p>Since then, I follow my own program of mixing strength and cardio-vascular activity. It took me two years to learn good form. And good form is really really hard to learn. Mainly because you have to go beyond prescriptive advice from books, coaches or the internet and find out what works well with your body. For example, I have relatively long femurs and a narrow squat stance ends up creating additional pressure on my knees. It took me a long fucking time to get over the prescriptive instructions that one&#x27;s squat stance <i>has</i> to be shoulder width.<p>Another thing that I personally realized was that very few people understand the principles behind a fitness goal as opposed to cargo cult practices. For example, for a long time, I thought that the only way to build strength was to do barbell exercises. On the other hand, there is a place for machines. This surprised me. Especially since the internet (bodybuilding.com/reddit) seem to chant about how anyone who doesn&#x27;t do barbells is doomed.<p>Also, learn the limits of your body. If you are not 17 and filled with natural testosterone or pump your body with steroids, it is going to be hard for you to achieve the kind of transformations that a lot of people appear to achieve. As you grow older, your body just doesn&#x27;t want to keep gaining muscle.",1400432422

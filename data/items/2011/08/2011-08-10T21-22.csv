Sure, I think money has had a corrupting influence on Congress, to the point of regulatory capture of legislatures by business in many cases.

This discourages analysis rather than promoting it.<p>- while I think an infrastructure bank is a good idea and should have been implemented back in Spring 2009, the idea that the President can just bring one into being by fiat is laughable.<p>- particularly a President that ~20% of the electorate entertains wild conspiracy theories about.<p>- it was said of Teddy Roosevelt: 'You must always remember that the President is about six.'

The largely Catholic ethnics were to be driven out of their neighborhoods into the suburbs, where they were to be ""Americanized"" according to WASP principles. The neighborhoods they left behind were to be turned over to the sharecroppers from the South or turned into futuristic Bauhaus enclaves for the new government elites.

    GRAVITY * mass
</code></pre>
At this point the JVM will aggressively optimize that method to inline the constant. If you later do:<p><pre><code>  GRAVITY /= 6 # we're on the moon now!

This change will affect the values of any computations that depend on the return value of g_force but should not affect which code paths get executed down the line. I'm probably missing something about how this mechanism works, but how would deoptimizing be triggered here?",1313012760

No university curriculum is limited classes where all notes will be in easily typed language.

Usually before a text, quiz, or essay I was frantically flipping through hundreds of pages trying to find relavent notes. With this, I was able to simply search ""LaGrange"" and was greeted with a wider understanding -- Notes came up from both calculus and economics.

I'll try and add some color from my knowledge of the travel industry and having been at Bing Travel and currently at a travel-focused startup.<p>1.  Both of you agree that the core <i>intention</i> of removing just plain bad flights is a good default for users since you're looking out for what most people would consider unreasonably painful flights.  The difference is whether or not calling it ""Agony"" makes sense to most people.  A good solution is to call out for new users that ""we have removed flights with 3+ stops or out of the way connections.  to see all flight options, clear filters"" and remove the pre-set filter conditions.<p>2.  I would agree with Durga here that ""From.."" sounds like a lead price and is normally looked up on in retailing with some skepticism. However, in the case of Hipmunk, because you are picking one leg, it makes sense since there is a wide range of pricing that begins with that base departure leg.<p>3.  On Kayak, see a departing flight you like?  Hover over and click on it and it'll now filter and show only flights with that departure leg so pages of results become usually just one or two pages all with the same departing flight.  Maybe one way to solve this without a second click is to show all of the return options on hover over a departure leg on Hipmunk.<p>4.  Durga's point is that for flights with multiple stops, it's useful to know actual time in air so for people who hate flying you can optimize your price-vs-fly-time tradeoff.<p>5.  Agreed, you can do some basic grouping like most travel sites do with early morning/morning/afternoon/evening/night.<p>6.  I've been thinking about this a bit as we work on our product and the pros of the tabs are: You can see a better layout of the information vs. the default display in a browser tab but the cons are heavier weight within the browser especially if your site has multiple views/layouts.  Also, if you start creating too many searches, the tabs start breaking other elements of the layout.  By default, you could make ""new search"" open a new tab landing on an optimized search page w/ your last search parameters pre-filled.<p>7.

Check. And we can do lots of things which will change how much CO2 and how much methane we dump into the atmosphere. Check.<p>Here's the sticky bit: If we could leave the planet, en-masse right now with all our farm animals and remove ourselves from the equation completely, the climate is still going to change from what its like today to something different.<p>We know that to be true because there is lots of evidence that it was different before we arrived on the scene, both hotter and colder.

By counting customer acquisition as an extraordinary expense they are implying that:<p>1. The value of that customer is AT LEAST as much the cost of acquisition; and<p>2. That cost also accounts for the natural loss of customers.<p>This is shady because (IMHO) daily deals customers have very little loyalty to the providers of those services, there is no natural barrier to prevent customers moving to LivingSocial or whomever and the high margin on deal split is transitory because increased competition will reduce what is really nothing more than the artificial scarcity introduced by Groupon's one deal a day (per market).<p>But none of that is why Groupon is a bad business (IMHO). Consider: Groupon offers a deal, people buy it and Groupon and the provider split those proceeds in some fashion. I believe--but don't know--that the provider has to wait for some large part of those proceeds too. Basically that delay is Groupon's cash flow.<p>So what's the best outcome for Groupon and the provider? One of two things:<p>1. The customer doesn't use that coupon. Groupon and the provider pocket the free money; or<p>2. The customer spends above the coupon or is a repeat customer such that the ""marketing cost"" (to the provider) of the Groupon offer is amortized over multiple visits and/or higher spend such that they make a profit.<p>In the case of (1), many providers really don't want customers to use coupons. There are plenty of anecdotes from people getting bad reactions when they tell a proprietor or a waiter or whatever that they're using a coupon, particularly in restaurants.<p>Worse, coupon users may be people who are prepared to pay full price anyway or the influx of coupon users may prevent full-paying customers from being able to use your service. The propaganda is that you can sell unused capacity. While true for some businesses I think you'll find that many people try to use Groupons in, say, restuarants at otherwise peak or busy times.<p>There are some success stories of (2) but plenty of failures too.<p>What isn't built into Groupon's financial statements is account risk. There is a strong argument that a failing business can make one last roll of the dice with a Groupon offer. If they fail, they were going under anyway.<p>I actually don't know if Google (disclaimer: I work for Google) tried to buy Groupon or not and if we did, at what price. The press reports Groupon turned down a $6 billion offer.<p>My <i>personal</i> opinion is that Google dodged a huge bullet <i>if this is true</i>.",1313010310

It takes a cognitive leap to go from the source code in front of them, and what happens at runtime. This disconnect is not present in straight-line code, but it becomes a problem when loops are introduced.<p>So, I agree with you. If the goal is to get beginners programming, then they have to program. No amount of reading is a substitute for programming. This book may be an excellent way to introduce people who have already done some programming to important concepts, but I doubt it will get them closer to being programmers.",1313010195

I was in Detroit visiting family a year or so ago, and we spent a day driving around the downtown area sightseeing (featuring commentary by elderly relatives about theaters, stores, restaurants, etc.). At one point, while leaving the Indian Village neighborhood, we came across a police roadblock; a series of U-turns and detours revealed that, in fact, the police had closed off an area several blocks on a side including a good-sized stretch of Jefferson (a major road in Detroit). There were several police helicopters buzzing around, lots of armed cops, etc. etc. This was during rush hour. After talking to some of the officers and some bystanders, we discovered what was happening: somebody had, upon being evicted from some sort of residential treatment facility, begun threatening people with a gun. When the police arrived, he shot at them, and then ran away. The police were currently trying to figure out which of several buildings he was in, and had closed off most of a neighborhood as well as a major street to try and contain the situation.[1]<p>In most cities, this sort of thing (major police operation, shots exchanged between police and armed member of public, street closures, etc.) would have been big news; that night, none of the local news broadcasts even mentioned it (one traffic report that afternoon did mention the closure of Jefferson, but didn't go into details). No headlines in the paper the next day, either.[2] My point here is that this sort of thing was apparently commonplace enough that it wasn't considered to be a newsworthy event, and none of my Detroit relatives seemed particularly surprised or concerned.<p>1. Notably, the particular chunk of neighborhood in question was at least half-abandoned (judging from the amount of ivy covering every second house).<p>2. Technically, by ""the paper the next day,"" I mean the Detroit Free Press's website. At that point in time the DFP wasn't printing week-day paper editions.",1313010115

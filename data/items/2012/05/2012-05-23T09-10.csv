4012342,comment,4010868,4012198,2,0,kelnos,,,"Er... what?<p>The common ObjC data structures (I assume you're talking about NSArray, NSDictionary, etc.) are <i>not</i> a part of the language.  They're a part of Foundation, which is the de-facto standard library of ObjC.  Just like the STL is the standard library of C++.<p>Initializing NSArray, NSDictionary, etc. with data in it has nothing to do with ObjC as a language.  Those initializers are merely instance methods on the objects themselves.  You could easily do that in C++ by writing a varargs function that initializes the object, something like:<p><pre><code>  template<class T>
  vector<T> *vector_new_with_items(T first_item, ...)
  {
      vector<T> *v = new vector<T>();
      va_list var_args;
      T item;
      
      v->push_back(first_item);
      va_start(var_args, first_item);
      while ((item = va_arg(var_args, T)))
          v->push_back(item);
      va_end(var_args);

      return v;
  }

  vector<const char *> *v = vector_new_with_items(""one"", ""two"", 0);
</code></pre>
... or something like that.  That's more or less what Foundation does when you do:<p><pre><code>  NSArray *a = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:@""one"", @""two"", nil];</code></pre>",1337766262

Doing nothing but blaming the parents doesn't help much.""<p>I don't understand why whenever this is an issue in society, it becomes something that the government has to go and fix. In the not so distant past, (let's say, at least up until the early 1950s), a number of problems were adressed by private (as in, non-governmental) initiatives (from profit and non-profit organizations, or simply community, family support). Now, we expect government to take care of everything. There seems to be no space for other solutions. Private initiatives seem to have completely disappeared from most people's mindset. This kind of mindset is even pervasive in the economical system where many people now believe it is the role of Government to ""stimulate"" the Economy. As if, the Economy was a ""by-product"" of government intervention!<p>I DO think there are clear limits between government scope and private scope, and in most modern countries this is something that the Constitution usually clarifies. You find that such limits are usually lacking in countries which tend to turn to despotism and dictatorship. When you break these boundaries, you end up (after a while, step by step...) with governments suppressing freedom of speech and telling people how they have to think. That is exactly why there are several Privacy Advocate groups which pay a lot of attention to this kind of issues.",1337763802

With traditional hardware, for every 100 computers you have, you'll replace 1 hard drive. A new hard drive will cost a fraction of the machine's initial price, let's say 1/5. So maintenance costs for storage devices are 1/500 the initial costs per year, maybe a bit more if you factor in the cost of the labor.<p>Now if you make the same cluster of servers out of ARM hardware, let's say you'll need 4x the number of machines to get the same processing power. That's 400 machines. If the storage devices on these machines have the same failure rate, you'll need to replace 4 machines per year. However, since you're buying a new machine, you're don't get to pay for just the storage device. It costs you 4/400, or 1/100 the initial cost to maintain the storage devices for your ARM cluster per year.<p>A huge assumption here is that both types of hardware have similar initial costs. So the point here is that it'll always be cheaper to compartmentalize your losses, unless ARM devices are <i>much</i> cheaper than traditional commodity hardware. Intuitively, throwing away a whole machine when something breaks is going to be a lot more expensive than just replacing the broken part. I don't imagine that it's extremely difficult to make parts replaceable on ARM boards, and it would definitely save some money, so I don't see why it shouldn't be done.<p>(Also, I realize that the Beaglebone uses SD cards, which are cheap and replaceable. But imagine that instead of storage devices, I'd used memory for the example)",1337763662

The think is that WHEN you want to develop something real you want to have these tools ready to go.<p>With your aditued there will not be that much progress, since everybody would have just said 'mmhh lets not develop a good compiler for C lets write assembler'. In my opinion as long as people develop better tools (languages, IDEs, compilers, debuggers) there is need for them. If one guy spends a couple of month on a Tool, how long will it take until the time saved is 'recoverd' by the users of that tool? Making tools yileds economic benefit, just like in the real word a maschine that does something better or faster will result in economic benefit.<p>That is not do say there is never mal-investment. Somebody might spend a long time developing something and nobody will use it, programming related or not. This however is not an argument for no innovation.",1337763661

4012198,comment,4010868,4010868,1,0,cageface,,,"The more I think about it the more I'm convinced that the insistence of the C++ designers that basic data structures could be defined <i>in the language itself</i> was a mistake. Only now in the most cutting edge C++11 compilers can you actually initialize a C++ vector directly like you can now in Obj-C, and the template machinery it takes to make that possible is truly terrible to behold. You still can't properly inspect most of the C++ containers in a debugger.<p>If instead they'd gone the Obj-C route and made the common data structures part of the language maybe they would have lost a little flexibility but the gain in programmer productivity would have been worth it, IMO. Hacking the Obj-C compiler instead to introduce a little more syntactic sugar results in much, much simpler language to use and understand.<p>It's a pity Obj-C doesn't really exist outside the Apple ecosystem. It gives you transparent access to native C code but also lets you get almost as dynamic as Smalltalk if you need to without all the baggage of a fullblown VM.",1337763650

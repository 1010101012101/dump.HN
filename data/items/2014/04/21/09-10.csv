7620440,comment,7617720,7620105,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"I suspect the powersat evolved as a mission justification:  so, we can conceive of human-habitable structures in space, but why would we do that.  From Heppenheimer&#x27;s book, it seems that the colony concept emerged first, then the powersat concept.<p>Once you&#x27;ve arrived at &quot;orbiting solar power stations built from lunar regolith&quot;, questioning your premises and realizing that the colonies really don&#x27;t make all that much sense.  But then again, pragmatism and overt missions never really ruled space anyway -- see Apollo and the Shuttle.<p>As for the technical reasons, to paraphrase Douglas Adams:  Space is expensive. Really expensive. You just won&#x27;t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly expensive it is.<p>The ISS is the most expensive single structure ever constructed, and among the most expensive single <i>projects</i> ever undertaken -- and that for a habitation for six people.  Total cost is somewhere north of $100 billion (how far north isn&#x27;t clear, the budget&#x27;s spread among multiple agencies and nations).<p>Given that, and absent tremendous gains in efficiency and automation, the cost of solar power satellites let alone O&#x27;Neil space colonies would be in the tens of trillions of dollars, minimum.  That&#x27;s on the scale of the entire US GDP, if not more.<p>As for your observation &quot;a lot more than actually did [happen]&quot;:  <i>Colonies in Space</i> is one of my benchmarks for rates of technological change that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> happen.  I&#x27;d anticipated that that could well be my future, but a decade and a half past when it was supposed to be a reality, it remains science fiction.  It&#x27;s given me a good sense of the sorts of change which are possible and likely, and those which aren&#x27;t.  And no, not all progress is subject to Kurzweil&#x27;s Law of Accelerating Returns.",1398074381

7620436,comment,7618971,7619914,2,0,quaunaut,,,"However you also have the luck of having a computer, being interested in computers, and being able to further than interest. Do you think you would&#x27;ve fared nearly as well, if your interest instead was in cars? Clothing design? Social work?<p>Us tech workers are fairly lucky that in all honesty, the things we tend to like seem to be problems that can be solved with one another.<p>I&#x27;d also argue, that while the billionaire&#x27;s life is not a million times better than the thousandaire, that this never was the case, and that is thinking of the best of times.<p>However, look at the worst of times. You get a serious illness- say, a cancer. For one, as a wealthy person you likely could have it detected much earlier from regular doctor visits and various signs. The poor never get this opportunity. When time comes for treatment, the best medicine, procedures, and rehabilitative therapy are available- and for the poor, they might be able to get the procedures, but the medicine will often be second-rate and there likely will be very little, or perhaps even <i>no</i> rehabilitation.<p>Similar states repeat for smaller life disasters. You get in a car wreck; The rich man likely has a newer car, and can much easier afford to use the insurance to get a worthwhile vehicle again without being out very much. The poor was probably driving a car worth less than $1500, with numerous problems already, but at least it was paid off. The wreck might leave them with only enough money to get another car, but now they must make payments and still only get another 2-3 years out of it, if they&#x27;re able to at all thanks to an insurance plan with less coverage.<p>There is a <i>huge</i> quality of life gap here. Being poor today isn&#x27;t at its worst when everything is going well- overall, things are pretty great there, and are a good reason why even lower middle class people rarely fall into absolute poverty. But the inability to pull oneself out of a hole is a much, much more pervasive problem.",1398074206

For crop-based fuels such as ethanol, productivity is well below 100 gallon/acre.  Scale that to the billions of barrels of oil consumed annually, and you&#x27;d need several times the present-day arable land of the US to produce the fuel used now.<p>Looking at primary productivity worldwide, humans already consume 14% of all plant growth.  Our fossil fuel utilization would be <i>another</i> 21% of this, according to Jeffrey Dukes in &quot;Burning Buried Sunshine&quot;, a 2003 paper (<a href=""http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange...</a>)<p>I see some promise in the US Navy Research Lab&#x27;s electricity-to-fuels project, using seawater as a feedstock for both hydrogen and carbon.  <i>That</i> could scale to national levels of production with only a few square km of plant, and about 40,000 km^2 of solar arrays (about 200 km on a side).  Given alternative proposals for fossil fuel replacements, it&#x27;s vastly further into the plausible space.<p>For some ballpark numbers:<p>• Conventional crop biodiesel or alcohol typically cite about 100 gallons/acre-year<p>• Typical algae biodiesel yields are 10x that, or around 1,000 gal/acre-yr<p>• I&#x27;ve seen claims of 10x that, for 10,000 gal/acre-yr<p>Assuming that last is possible, you&#x27;d need 124,000 km^2 (350 km on a side), or 30 million acres (about 7% of present US cropland) to supply all present petroleum use.

The difference is only whether an apostate is given the opportunity to repent or not, or whether he is given a certain number of days to repent. But it is a fact that Islamic Law demands everywhere that the apostate is put to death.&quot; [1]<p>Here is Dr. Mohammad Mukadam, (then) Chairman of the Association of Muslim Schools, stating in debate with Richard Dawkins that the penalty for apostasy is death:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvWdWZq8To"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qvWdWZq8To</a><p>Now, let&#x27;s look at the treatment in law [2]:<p>* Afghanistan – illegal (death penalty, although the U.S. and other coalition members have put pressure that has prevented recent executions)<p>* Egypt – illegal (3 years&#x27; imprisonment)<p>* Iran – illegal (death penalty)<p>* Jordan – possibly illegal (fine, jail, child custody loss, marriage annulment) although officials claim otherwise, convictions are recorded for apostasy<p>* Malaysia – illegal in five of 13 states (fine, imprisonment, and flogging)<p>* Mauritania – illegal (death penalty if still apostate after 3 days)<p>* Oman – legal in criminal code, but according to the family code, a father can lose custody of his child<p>* Pakistan – illegal (death penalty since 2007)<p>* Qatar – illegal (death penalty)<p>* Saudi Arabia – illegal (death penalty, although there have been no recently reported executions)<p>* Somalia – illegal (death penalty)<p>* Sudan – illegal (death penalty, although there have only been recent reports of torture, and not of execution)<p>* United Arab Emirates – illegal (3 years&#x27; imprisonment, flogging)<p>* Yemen – illegal (death penalty)<p>So.  There is complete agreement amongst all major sources of Islamic law that apostasy should be punishable by death; in many Islamic countries it is, and in others it is otherwise punishable.<p>Would you care to provide an &quot;accurate source of Islamic law&quot; that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> manifest this particular evil?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.answering-islam.org/Authors/Arlandson/bassiouni_apostasy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answering-islam.org/Authors/Arlandson/bassiouni_a...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy#Countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy#Countries</a>",1398071741

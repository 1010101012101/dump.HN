8394886,comment,8392138,8392447,5,0,saucetenuto,,,"Lambdas in C++ are pretty new.  Most of us who used std::algorithm had to write our own functor structs and do the variable capture by hand.  Except that typically we didn&#x27;t, because at that point a for loop is more readable.  I think that&#x27;s the essential objection to the STL: it&#x27;s a library built around functional programming and not OO, in a language built around OO and not functional programming.<p>And of course there are a bunch of small dumb things in it.  Why do we have make_heap() and friends instead of a heap type?  Why does binary_search() return a bool instead of an iterator?  Why didn&#x27;t we get any hash tables until like 2010?  Who thought the vector<bool> specialization was a good idea, and why didn&#x27;t they benchmark it first?<p>The STL is a weird mix of brilliant, visionary API design and abject failure.  Because of C++&#x27;s many limitations, the fail-y parts are the parts that most people are most familiar with.  C++11 has done an incredible amount to turn that around, but at this point, for me, it&#x27;s too late: I&#x27;d rather have a new language and new library, informed by C++&#x27;s successes without being bound to its mistakes.",1412175512

I&#x27;m comfortable working at any level from handful-of-KB bare-metal microcontrollers to Linux kernel drivers to complex multithreaded application design, and I enjoy the variety of working in multiple domains.<p>My most extensive experience is in block storage peripherals. I&#x27;ve written drivers for a variety of storage protocols and I&#x27;ve designed and built the software architecture for products that move data from storage device A to storage device B at improbably high speeds.

I&#x27;m not happy with false dichotomies, like this features/speed tradeoff. There <i>is</i> a real tradeoff to be made between those, but nowhere near the level I&#x27;ve seen in IDEs.<p>Many problems seem to depend on the way modules/extensions are implemented.<p>For example, we could implement plugins by allowing event listeners which can run arbitrary, imperative code. However, this leads to redundant computation (multiple &quot;get(foo);&quot; and &quot;set(foo, bar)&quot; calls spread across listeners), increases the chance of plugins conflicting due to race conditions, requiring very conservative scheduling, etc.<p>An alternative, like a hook/advice system, would have the core performing gets/sets exactly when they&#x27;re needed, but give plugins the ability to override the return values using hooks (like a dynamic form of decorators). This avoids the redundancy, race conditions and scheduling issues.",1412175490

It incorporates a realtime LaTeX WYSIWIG editor, includes a full compiler pipeline to interpret unstructured user math input and transform it into meaningful and efficiently-evaluable code, and makes extensive use of modern web technologies such as web workers and canvas rendering. The calculator core is modular and well-tested code which powers our free-to-use desktop, tablet, and mobile versions, used by millions of students, as well as driving our API, which many of the world&#x27;s largest education companies use to power their graphing and math input. There&#x27;s a lot to do to make the calculator faster, more powerful, more featureful and more beautiful, build out mobile apps, and continue to grow the calculator API.<p>We&#x27;re not big into hard requirements, but a love of and interest in math is non-negotiable.<p>If this is the right job for you, you&#x27;re probably also interested in numerical and geometric computation, compilers, code generation, performance optimization, API design, CAS implementation and graphics.<p>-- Software Developer (lessons) --<p>Desmos is redefining what online math content can look like by treating the creation of each lesson as software development. Each lesson we build has unique interactions, streams realtime data to other students and to the teacher dashboard, and has to work effectively across a wide range of devices. Basically, we&#x27;re building a new app every few weeks, each one designed by our team of world-class educators and designers. If you&#x27;re not excited by a never-ending stream of ready-to-build projects that will each make a significant impact on a specific area of math education, this is not the position for you.<p>We need to see a demonstrated ability to create high-quality interactive experiences rapidly, and a love of math and teaching.<p>Bonus points if you&#x27;ve produced and maintained code in a high-throughput / multi-product environment, developed complex single-page web apps, built complex touch interactions, or spent time as an educator.<p>-- Why Desmos --<p>Here&#x27;s what it means to work at Desmos.<p><pre><code>  * Great benefits: full medical and dental, catered lunch every day, unlimited vacation days whenever you need them.\n  * Productive environment: no mandatory meetings, bureaucracy, or artificial barriers.

Most European countries will therefore regulate these, but they won&#x27;t necessarily regulate ancillary parts like receivers or stocks.

Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It&#x27;s like building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of the right color pieces.<p>At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we&#x27;re creative people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow, and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.<p>Having the best people doesn&#x27;t hurt, either. We&#x27;ve got most of them already, and we&#x27;re looking to find the rest. You can build things with us. What&#x27;s the catch? We&#x27;re pretty darn selective.<p>To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can work on every part of an application, from the data store to the page–sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.<p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target. We&#x27;re service-oriented, and you should be too.<p>Still reading? Please apply! And check out our Web Framework Benchmarks while you&#x27;re at it. We pretty much wrote the book on that one.<p>Just so you know:<p><pre><code>   Teams range between 2-6 people\n   Developers are exposed to 3-4 projects per year\n   All development is done on high-performance workstations with 4K displays.

Here is a snapshot of what we&#x27;re using now:<p><pre><code>   Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n   Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n   Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n   Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n   Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n   Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB)\n</code></pre>\nWe don&#x27;t expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but we do expect you&#x27;ll learn more about them every day.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you&#x27;d like to work, please apply here: <a href=""http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2</a>",1412174443

8394665,comment,8387701,8388764,0,0,lmm,,,"> How do we really know this? The Japanese were ready for a long drawn out decades conflict. The US forces were war-weary and war was draining the economy. This could have gone on with quite some time, or ended in a frozen conflict that would reignite periodically. Who knows, but a quick non-nuclear win was certainly not in the cards.<p>A quick non-nuclear win was very much on the cards. The soviet union had just entered the war. The navy knew that it couldn&#x27;t protect the homeland and didn&#x27;t have any planes. There was, at the very least, a substantial faction in the cabinet that wanted to surrender, and had the support of the emperor in this. Can we be sure the war would have ended quickly? No. Can we be sure that the human cost would have been less than the ~200,000 civilian deaths caused by the bombs? Definitely not - conventional firebombing could have inflicted those kind of casualties if the war had continued for as little as another week or two. But a decade-long conflict or frozen ceasefire is really implausible; the balance of conventional forces was really overwhelming at that point.<p>> Arguably, if the US used nukes on Chinese soldiers during the Korean conflict, as some generals advised, there would be no North Korea. We&#x27;d have a cowed China and built a single free and democratic Korea, essentially one large South Korea. Instead we have one of the worst regimes the world has ever seen as a client state of China, who uses China&#x27;s political influence and muscle to threaten the West with nuclear war every day. So, progress?<p>You could equally argue that if the US had given up and pulled out of Korea entirely, instead of North and South Korea we&#x27;d have a country like Vietnam, which is doing pretty well. Or that if the Soviet Union had used nukes to conquer the world we&#x27;d have peace everywhere. Everyone thinks they&#x27;re the &quot;good guy&quot;; any moral principle that would allow the US to use nukes would seem to allow other countries to do so too.",1412174239

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are in Portugal right now! Want to come?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C (and Swift),
    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

Each group or person tries to get their pronoun - ve, ze, co - adopted as standard but it&#x27;s difficult because they&#x27;re invented, so nobody knows about them, so you have to have this discussion every time you use one.<p>I&#x27;m friends with an asexual person who doesn&#x27;t identify as male or female, and ze asked me to use the &quot;ze&quot; pronoun when referring to zer. I do in zer presence but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to drop a sentence like that when somebody asks what I did yesterday.

The university was boring and I couldn&#x27;t focus on the stuff we were doing there because it was to easy, and the way we were learning it was... not suitable for me.<p>Talk with people, it helps. You will feel frustrated for most of it, but I must say - it is really worth it. It is just a year, it would be a shame to lose the previous years. \nI promised myself that I will do it. And I stuck it out, got my &quot;let&#x27;s d this&quot; hat on, kept the jobs, finished uni and now doing a gap year before my masters - I need a break.

A mortgage is dependent on your ability to repay, i.e. your net income, if the income tax rate went up then mortgage companies would also reduce the amount they would lend you.<p>The alternatives are either a graduate tax - which has all of the issues you mention, except you never stop paying it, so potentially pay far more than the cost of your education - or general taxation in which case the people who didn&#x27;t go to university (generally less well off) are paying for your degree.",1412172056

I&#x27;m not criticizing testability, but passion and intellectual freedom just seemed at odds to me.<p>A better discussion would be, how did the language and tools get chosen? Is it a drive for some uniformity only? Different tools are good for different purposes of course, and I&#x27;m guessing in your solution there are different problem domains, not all served by a single choice of tool.<p>A good question to ask during the interview I guess.<p>Good luck with your new direction!",1412172056

Turns out they thought we were employees of Punspace which is untrue. We&#x27;re all still here but good news so far is that they aren&#x27;t targeting digital nomads.<p>Update: At Thai immigration near the airport, everyone got interviewed but were treated extremely kindly.  It ended up taking a few hours and felt like a big waste of time, but nothing bad actually happened.  The owners of PunSpace were even nice enough to bring us lunch. - See more at: <a href=""http://www.johnnyfd.com/2014/09/live-updates-immigration-crackdown-in.html#sthash.EnYX5xno.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnnyfd.com/2014/09/live-updates-immigration-cra...</a>",1412172032

Think of it this way- Right now you can find books in the library written by people who have committed genocides. If we were to ban all the good (or at least of academic value) works of people who also did some very bad things, we&#x27;d have to burn A LOT of media, and arguably to the detriment of us all. Cutting off the nose to spite the face...<p>He should have been punished somehow, but not in this way.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m sure his lectures will be torrentable, if they&#x27;re that good.",1418119187

8721943,comment,8719614,8720640,0,0,sytelus,,,"Before you project your anecdot as a massive generalization of all PHD programs, consider the fact that at least in computer science, there are VERY happy PHDs working at Google, Twitter, FB and others who are glad to have an expertise in fields like machine learning, NLP, IR and computer vision which otherwise would be difficult to attain. Many of these people in fact got hired at these companies <i>because</i> of their PHD degree. In fact, just about few years ago Google had reputation of sweeping clean pretty much all CS PhDs from top 50 schools IIRC. So getting PHD in fields like CS is definitely not a waste of time. Now sure you can end up with bad advisor but that&#x27;s where you are supposed to do your homework ie background checks on professors and consult former students on their experience. The process of choosing advisor is very critical, you need to find your cultural fit and you need to have very strong intersection on research areas. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of choice then you are likely underqualified and you would end up choosing something suboptimal that is destined to make you unhappy. Perhaps you were better off just looking for real job in that case instead of insisting on PHD degree. Either way I don&#x27;t see why your experience with your advisor should be a reason to universally downgrade all PHD programs out there.",1418119110

I chose to do my PhD in the UK and not bother with US programmes, which seem to have a toxic culture (similar to interns in banks working ridiculous hours for no reason). I accept that I&#x27;ll probably have to do a postdoc before being considered equal to a US PhD, but that&#x27;s a low cost for not being abused as free labour and having the opportunity to get out with something. I also wonder if in the US not having to have a masters first, four year undergrad masters courses are the norm here for hard sciences, makes it harder for people to make informed decisions.<p>Ultimately, does the UK, or other countries with different systems such as France, produce less good science? No.",1418119102

8721934,comment,8718776,8720780,0,0,72deluxe,,,"I used Borland Codegear and C++ Builder before that for a number of years, then moved to Visual Studio, spent significant time in Eclipse developing Android apps, and also spent a large amount of time in KDevelop and Code::blocks under Linux.<p>Xcode took some getting used to when I first came across it (&quot;Where are all the buttons? How come the big PLAY button at the top runs the app but doesn&#x27;t CONTINUE like it does in VS? Why are there no floating windows? How come the project and target options are a big list of stuff instead of tabbed pages? (The filter helps!) Why does it crash if I have a large header with many #defines in it? How do I easily switch between Release and Debug targets? Why is there no built-in TODO/FIXME filter?&quot;).... but having used it for a few years and having seen the updates to it and daily using it, I really really enjoy using it now. The debug overview of memory use and CPU/Network use and deep Instruments integration (&quot;where am I leaking?!?! Let&#x27;s just take a look!&quot;), as well as the splitting usage by thread during runtime is really helpful and there isn&#x27;t much going on screenwise, so I just have to look at code. The recent version is better than the previous one because it has a logical call graph shown for each thread instead of a popup irritating menu like the previous one (click click click click misclick arrgggh)<p>The navigation bar at the top is also strangely useful, with back and forward buttons! I never thought I&#x27;d miss that but I do if I go elsewhere.<p>A trip back to VS (admittedly an old version, thanks work) makes for unpleasant experiences (argh building is sooooo slow, where are parallel builds???).<p>The &#x27;callers/callees&#x27; list is really helpful when inside a function to see where things are getting called from; admittedly no refactor support for C++ is disappointing but I don&#x27;t really use refactoring much.<p>EDIT: One thing I really really really miss from Visual Studio is the Ctrl-Shift-Space shortcut for showing function parameters. You get them as a hint first time in Xcode and it might shove them into the text where you can tab between parameters but with overloaded functions it typically chooses the wrong function. With VS the popup hint dynamically changes as you&#x27;re typing to show the right overload, and I miss it.",1418118938

8721932,comment,8719614,8719614,0,0,reuven,,,"I finished my PhD about 6 months ago, at the age of 44, married and with three children.  It took me 11 years, and cost an enormous amount of money.  Before I started, I was an independent consultant.  After finishing, I&#x27;m an independent consultant.  I never planned to go into academia.<p>So, why did I do a PhD?  I was told that I would learn lots of new things, and meet lots of new people -- and escape, to some degree, the frustration that I was experiencing with my consulting business.<p>It&#x27;s true that I met lots new people.  And it&#x27;s true that I learned a <i>ton</i>.  And I&#x27;m very proud of the research that I did, resulting in a Web site that is used by thousands of researchers and students every week.  (The Modeling Commons -- <a href=""http://modelingcommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelingcommons.org/</a>, if you&#x27;re curious.)  And I also go to experience a different sort of frustration than I have had when consulting.<p>And yet, was it worthwhile?  I continue to wrestle with that question.  My family and I were hugely stressed for more than a decade.  Our finances are improving (thanks to my consulting work), but it&#x27;ll be another year or so before we&#x27;re back to where we were.  I&#x27;m frustrated that I didn&#x27;t create lots of products and businesses during those 11 years.<p>And the incredible frustration of the PhD process, and of having an advisor who drove me completely and utterly batty, cannot be ignored.<p>If you want to do research, then you should do a PhD -- but you should know what you&#x27;re getting into beforehand, and be really sure that you want to do research.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to do research, but want to boost your creds, and if you&#x27;re single and young, then it might be worthwhile.<p>If you&#x27;re like me, in your mid-30s, married, with children, and the primary breadwinner, then you should think long and hard about whether you want the PhD.  Several of the others who did PhDs mid-career in my program had spouses earning good incomes, didn&#x27;t have children, or both.<p>I do believe that having the PhD has already helped to boost my career a bit, helping me to find newer and bigger clients who somehow think that having a PhD makes you smarter or better than the rest of the population.<p>But would I recommend it to someone else in my position?  Not without a lot of thought and consideration.  And an understanding that what you think will take 5 years or so might take much longer than that.",1418118900

8721922,comment,8716538,8716538,0,0,vidarh,,,"This one is incredibly fascinating, even though it is simplified. One thing to keep in mind is that even if you exclude racial biases, you will maintain segregation if people have other - correlated - biases or limitations on their ability to move:<p>In many countries, poverty is highly correlated with race, for example. This is certainly the case with the US, but also elsewhere. I live in London, and you see interesting effects of this.<p>The inner city boroughs are quite segregated, both by race and wealth.<p>Meanwhile, some of the outer boroughs are showing the reverse effect, where property price points appears to be a driver for mixing. E.g. Croydon, where I live, is one of the most mixed in London - it&#x27;s at a price point that creates both young professionals of all races, and more established families of all races who are united in finding the inner boroughs either too expensive or too poor.<p>But overall: Imagine that nobody had a racial preference, but had a wealth preference - and limitations.<p>Now to overcome segregation, you face a near insurmountable barrier: Wealthier people would need to be willing to settle for housing and an environment of a much worse standard than they can afford, and poorer people would be unable to find housing that makes much difference.<p>This is one of the biggest problems. The recent US situation with demonstrations over police killings, the race aspect has been blown out of proportion: You don&#x27;t solve anything by focusing on the race issue, because so much of the violence is correlated more strongly with poverty than with race. You want to solve racial issues, start by addressing poverty. You&#x27;ll <i>still</i> have race issues at the end of it, but it will turn out vastly smaller than what it appears, and you&#x27;ll have removed a substantial source of excuses for racial biases.",1418118709

Computers are better at us when it comes to problems that are clearly defined and for the problem is decidable (can implement an algorithm to solve any instance of the problem). But we need AI when the problems are more fuzzy, like recognizing a lion in a picture.<p>How can we build a mostly automated future, if the AIs that are supposed to do our jobs turn out to be very fallible as well? They won&#x27;t - supposedly - have the problem of being self-aware and being able to follow their emotions rather than their own best judgement and reasoning.

8721919,comment,8721379,8721821,0,0,raquo,,,"I&#x27;ve actually researched this option. Using compressed air as a structural component is a valid construction technique and could be applied to <i>hang</i> gliders.<p>It won&#x27;t work on paragliders because as ram-air wings, they need to collapse when they get unloaded. Otherwise once unloaded the wing will fall over in front of the pilot and probably get entangled with the pilot.<p>The only heavier-than-air inflatable aircraft currently in production is the Woopy – <a href=""http://fly.woopyjump.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fly.woopyjump.com/</a> – its design is very unconventional, with continuously running pumps and some weird flight control mechanism. It never passed certification because it&#x27;s probably not as strong as other hang gliders.<p>Some potential problems of inflatable hang gliders:<p>* Ambient air pressure differences at varying altitudes, temperatures, etc.<p>* Bird attack – sometimes eagles and other birds can get aggressive and try to claw a hang glider. What is a minor annoyance now could be a dangerous flaw if your glider is inflatable.<p>* A failed inflatable wing can potentially gift-wrap around the pilot preventing them from throwing the reserve parachute in time.<p>* Less rigidity than metal tubes – danger of buckling at higher speeds / wing-loading.<p>* There&#x27;s a certain stigma among HG pilots regarding the concept of inflatable aircraft due to controversy around Woopy and the general idea of riskiness.<p>However, inflatable aircraft IS a practical strategy. The shortcomings listed above can be overcome given enough effort.<p>For example, see <a href=""http://www.prospective-concepts.ch/html/site_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prospective-concepts.ch/html/site_en.htm</a> – click on Projects / Air / Pneuwing (and other projects).<p>Also, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear_Inflatoplane"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear_Inflatoplane</a><p>Lastly, in all likeliness the only advantage of an inflatable hang glider would be portability. I don&#x27;t think it will end up lighter than a tube+fabric construction. The guys from Prospective Concepts seem to believe that they will achieve better glide performance with an inflatable design, but to be honest I doubt that. But then again, they know much more about their technology than I do.",1418118629
8721918,comment,8715993,8715993,0,0,205guy,,,"Expatriation and taxes are complex issues with many facets, and I feel the author of the article is naively or deceitfully ignoring them to only focus on the unrealistic solution that would benefit him. First, let&#x27;s get the taxation-without-representation trope out of the way: you can always vote by absentee ballot in federal elections in your place of last residence in the US [1]. I think it reflects rather poorly on someone if they don&#x27;t even make that effort--and then complain about it.<p>As for actually paying taxes, that&#x27;s fairly well covered in the comments: you don&#x27;t unless you&#x27;re making big bucks. The issue seems to be paying an accountant to do the paperwork. Yes, it is slightly more paperwork for an expatriate, but plenty of people in the US pay an accountant to do their taxes too (itemizations, deductions, capital gains, and lots of fancy accounting to reduce taxes). Accountants seem to be about $500, so the $5K figure is for the full service expat (the upper tier whose company pays for everything--or used to), or for those who have 2 businesses like the author. Heck, taxes for business owners in the US are probably $5K as well. For regular employees, it is also possible to download the forms online and file your taxes yourself. That&#x27;s what I did when I lived abroad as a student and employee.<p>The new reporting by foreign banks for US citizens seems to be an actual issue. Making foreign banks deal with US bureaucracy sounds like a nightmare, and if they do refuse expat American customers, that might be a problem in day-to-day living. That probably does need some real-world solution, such as raising the limit to 20K for a basic checking account.<p>The complexity of the US tax forms comes from the innumerable deductions and allowances that are meant to encourage some form of economic behavior (e.g. buy solar panels or invest in local businesses). It&#x27;s not an ideal system, but it does provide a lot of flexibility and it&#x27;s one way for the gov&#x27;t to set economic policy in a county that frowns on more direct gov&#x27;t involvement.<p>Finally, on the moral side of the issue, I don&#x27;t see any problem with a country keeping tabs on the wealth of its citizens who are free to come and go. It&#x27;s the tyranny of the IRS: rich and poor alike must file. Nobody argues they shouldn&#x27;t pay taxes when they are in the US, but in order to do that properly, you can&#x27;t turn a blind eye to what happens to their money when they happen to be out of the country. As other commenters have said, having US citizenship is an insurance of some sorts, and if/when you move back, the irs wants to know where you stashed all your foreign earnings.<p>I think the US <i>is</i> unique in this regard: lots of wealth, lots of freedoms including travel, lots of tax deductions, and a ruthless IRS that is known to go after the rich and the poor alike. Other countries would probably like to have the power to enforce their tax regimes abroad, but can&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/voting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/voting.html</a>",1418118593

My personal favourite is when you forget to set translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints to NO on a container view.  A whole bunch of implicit constraints pop into existence that conflict with your actual programmed constraints, and the error message that tells you that you have constraint conflicts really doesn&#x27;t help you in figuring out where the constraints are coming from.  Eventually you figure this out, and you don&#x27;t get caught out by it any more, but in the learning phase, it&#x27;s quite painful.<p>Something else I really dislike when it comes to constraints - they don&#x27;t play well with animations, at least in my experience. I recently created a view that had a variable number of square buttons in it that were laid out in a grid two rows high.  Making a nice animation when you add a new button, fading in the new button, and sliding the others out of the way was nigh on impossible (ie &#x27;not possible without writing more code than if I had just done the layout manually).

It lets you recursively pack up directories and post them as an encoded linked list of Tweets to Twitter: <a href=""https://github.com/rw/tweetfs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rw/tweetfs</a><p>Plainsight uses each byte of the input message to generate tokens. Bits are used to decide how to traverse the token tree, weighted by frequency. The drawbacks are 1) verbosity and 2) incorrect grammar.<p>One of the lessons of writing Plainsight is that spam can be used to contain secret messages. Send enough gibberish to enough people, with your intended recipient included, and you&#x27;ll look like a spammer--not a spy.<p>-- Example 1 (regular text)
Type your message to encode:<p><pre><code>   echo &#x27;Meet at Union Square at noon. The password is FuriousGreen.&#x27; > cleartext
</code></pre>
Then, pipe it through Plainsight:<p><pre><code>   cat cleartext | plainsight -m encipher -f sherlock.txt > ciphertext

The output will be Doyle-esque gibberish:<p><pre><code>   cat ciphertext | fold -s

This is a special kind of PhD, called &quot;CIFRE&quot; which roughly means &quot;PhD in a company&quot;. You&#x27;re employed for 3 years by both an academic lab/uni and a company. The goal is to solve an industrial research problem that benefits both the lab and the company.<p>Personally I&#x27;m very happy to be doing this kind of thesis. I&#x27;m not in a major lab, so I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t be able to fight much against Ivy League PhDs but I&#x27;m still getting the degree and I&#x27;m okay with it. In the future I don&#x27;t seek to teach a lot but to do mostly research.<p>Besides having a good relationship with my advisors I&#x27;m also super happy that I don&#x27;t have a student debt (French education is mostly free -- even for top engineering schools). The pay is good, not as much as an engineer but plenty of people with lower degrees would already be happy with it, so no reason to complain. With this company-linked PhD I also get to study 100% while being officially employed as an engineer, it&#x27;s on my contract. If I ever want to hide the PhD from my resume (I&#x27;m sure I never will), I can basically write &quot;I&#x27;ve been a research engineer for three years&quot; and this would be the truth.<p>I also get to see how it works in the industrial world and to be more aware when, after the degree, I have to choose between going back to the engineer path or getting further into the academic road.",1418116301

8721804,comment,8716425,8716637,0,0,shk,,,"I know uber is flouting regulatory laws in India but banning the company outright is definitely not the right solution. And again there is the question that how the said ban is going to be imposed. The Union Transport Ministry of India has given a statement saying banning uber doesn&#x27;t make sense [1]
Also, in a developing country like India, with no centralized repository of past records, it&#x27;s extremely tough to do background checks. [2]
It&#x27;s busy to blame the system, but here the system in my opinion is more at fault than Uber. 
Clearly, uber provides a net value-add of hailing a taxi over traditional taxi services. Rather than banning them, a better way will be to have a digitized system where past records of a driver can be viewed and making it accessible to all taxi companies. Just strengthening regulations is not enough. There should be clear ways and benefits of operating within the regulatory framework.<p>[1] <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Banning-Uber-doesnt-make-sense-Nitin-Gadkari-says/articleshow/45430544.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Banning-Uber-d...</a>

They usually come as the first or second step (after the phone interview), which means you aren&#x27;t even really being seriously considered yet. You have to spend several hours working on it while they just have to send the email to whatever their challenge link is. Best case scenario, you wasted those hours because you were qualified to do what they assigned you to, and you simply move to the &#x27;next round&#x27;. Worst case, you get rejected for any reason or even no reason.<p>I have seen a few done maybe correctly. They really have to either be short, or otherwise compensated. One company is paying a few hundred dollars for the result of the coding challenge if they like your result, and are using it to entirely replace the first rounds of interview (coding challenge => skip directly to onsite and collect $500). These cases seem to be outliers rather than the norm though.<p>Thanks Jeff Atwood.",1418116151

I use Visual Studio in my day job, but I prefer to use Emacs for most of my side dev these days. Given that perhaps I don&#x27;t use everything an IDE has to offer.<p>Comparing Visual Studio with XCode, the following features are what I use to most.<p>Autocomplete - XCode wins here. Say I have two variables - clientService and clientMapper. In XCode I can type cl<tab> and it will complete the client part of the variable for me, I then only have to choose between Service and Mapper. Visual Studio doesn&#x27;t. Pressing <tab> will choose the entire current selected item.<p>Quick open - XCode wins. Cmd + Shift + O (I think) start typing the file name, hit enter and there you are. Visual Studio (without Resharper) forces you to search through the Solution Explorer, which is slow and searches for methods as well as files.<p>Syntax/Error/Warning Highlighting. Both IDEs do this just fine.<p>Debugging - Cant think of anything to differentiate these IDE&#x27;s. It used to be a real pain to inspect variables in XCode, but that was more GCCs fault rather than XCode. Since moving to LLVM, I haven&#x27;t had any problems.<p>Refactoring - I probably don&#x27;t use these tools as much as I could. But the basics are covered. Extract method, rename variables etc.. can be handled fine by both. I don&#x27;t use anything else.<p>Vim keybindings. There is vsVim for Visual Studio and now I see there is XVim for XCode.",1418115967

8721777,comment,8721650,8721650,0,0,Animats,,,"There was a similar result a few months ago for another type of machine learning. (That&#x27;s note 26 in this paper.) The problem seemed to be that the training process produces results which are too near boundaries in some dimension, and are thus very sensitive to small changes.  Such models are subject to a sort of &quot;fuzzing attack&quot;, where the input is changed slightly and the output changes drastically.<p>There are two parts of this process that are kind of flaky. The problem above is one of them. The other part is feature extraction where the feature set is learned from the training set.  The features thus selected are chosen somewhat randomly and are very dependent on the training set.  It&#x27;s amazing to me that works at all.  Earlier thinking was to have some canonical set of features (vertical lines, horizontal lines, various kinds of curves, etc.), the idea being to mimic early vision, the processing that happens in the retina.  Automatic feature choice apparently outperforms that, but may not really be working as well as previously believed.<p>It&#x27;s great seeing all this progress being made.",1418115801

These are features I&#x27;m using every single day:<p>* Buttons and toolbars - I don&#x27;t use any. I have more or less consistent shortcuts between AppCode and XCode, and for less used features I&#x27;m using Cmd+Shift+A shortcut. It&#x27;s an equivalent Cmd+Shift+P in Sublime and more powerful feature search than standard Cmd+? (which search only inside menus).<p>* Code navigation - put cursor on function, variable, property, whatever, press Alt+F7. You&#x27;ll get a split panel, on the left are all places where function/variable/property is used (and you can filter it by read or write access), on the right is the preview panel, so you can see the code without changing cursor position in your main editor.<p>* Code navigation - Cmd + Ctrl + J to easily jump between function definition and declaration<p>* Refactoring - rename: yes, XCode have Rename, but AppCode rename is much more streamlined: put cursor on method/property name, press Ctrl+Cmd+E, change the name in place, as I&#x27;m typing every occurrence of the method/property name changes. I press Enter and the change is done, without modal dialog to review change. And rename works on protocols, too.<p>* Refactoring - Change Signature: in case I need to reorder function parameters. Put cursor on method name, Cmd+F6, reorder/rename parameters. And AppCode is smart enough to try to preserve natural flow of words - if the function is called saveContent:toFile, when I reorder params it will become saveToFile:content:<p>* Refactoring - easy promotion from ivar to property. And vice versa.<p>* Local history - I try to commit as often as possible, but I like an ability to see what I changed on the file in last couple of hours (with diff). And that option saved my ass couple of times.<p>* AppCode marks methods/properties that aren&#x27;t used. I like to delete code. Less code is better. Very useful after refactoring.<p>* Better editor - I can split my editor horizontally/vertically however times I wish.<p>* Better editor - Shift + Ctrl + 1 - 9 will toggle quick bookmark. Ctrl + Alt + 1 - 9 will jump on the bookmark.<p>* Better editor - Cmd + Alt + UpArrow will expand selection. First sub-word (up to first &quot;hump&quot; in camel case) will be selected, then the whole word, then the next word, then the whole line... Cmd + Alt + DownArrow will go the other way.<p>* Better editor - Shift + Alt + Up/Down Arrow (or Shift + Alt + Click) will make multiple cursors, just like Sublime. Handy for changing lots of similar text lines.<p>* Better editor - select couple lines of code, Alt + Cmd + T will bring &quot;Surround With...&quot; popup. Press the mnemonic on the right to surround text with if, if/else, while, respondsToSelector, #ifdef,@try/@catch, etc, etc, etc. Time saver.<p>* Better editor - type SomeVeryLongClassNameIReallyHateToTypeTwice* var = alloc, press Tab, and AppCode will change &quot;alloc&quot; with [[SomeVeryLongClassNameIReallyHateToTypeTwice alloc] init]. Time saver.<p>* Better editor - Cmd+N will bring &quot;Generate&quot; popup where you can choose &quot;Override method&quot; or &quot;Implement method&quot;, among other things. When the list of methods to implement/override is shown, you just type to narrow the selection. It&#x27;s way faster to implement mandatory or optional delegate methods that way than to XCode-like start typing return value, then tableView: (for example) and picking the right method from the list.<p>Etc, etc - there&#x27;s many more small things that good IDE ( * ) does to make programming more enjoyable.

But Traditional Chinese Medicine and Homeopathic Oncology are not treatments; they operate under fraudulent principles - they are, at best, Lifestyle interventions that claim to operate by exerting theraputic effects.<p>The placebo effect is huge, my friend, and AMA-approved medicine is not exempt from it. You do realize that the last four gruelling years of your life, and those years ahead, will make you <i>believe</i> that you can cure people right? And that belief is also held by most patients. So, even if you screw up or in fact have no idea what you are really doing, you get the benefit of the placebo effect in almost every patient that believes that you will cure them.<p>You are as much a witch doctor as the holistic practitioners. It is likely that in 100 years, doctors will say that the medicine that you are practicing now was incredibly misinformed- no, not because you didn't believe in ""some kooks"", but because of everything that is continuously just wrong because we don't have all of the answers.<p>BTW- are you really a med school student?

What we should really be comparing is: does an individual allocate their first $100,000 of income with any different efficiency than their second, third, or fifteenth $100k of income?  If you give $1000 to a person who makes $50,000 a year, and $1000 to someone who makes $1,000,000 a year, who will allocate that money better?  I think most of us would feel intuitively that the person making $50,000 would use it ""better"", but there's fair arguments to the contrary as well (including figuring out what ""better"" means).

In the recent election, 8/10 of the wealthiest counties in the US voted for President Obama, and his stance on tax rates was clear. If those voters are willing to pay higher taxes, I'm fine with that.<p>But what I really hate is the class warfare and populist messages driving fiscal policy. With the threshold at $250k, the tax hikes would still only bring in enough added revenue to cover 8 days of federal spending. And ""fair share""?

The majority of software engineers only have undergrad degrees and don't really need anything more than that. This is my case and I'm up for a wait of probably 3-4 years for an employer sponsored green card.<p>The green card lottery is an odd beast and frankly I think is my best bet of getting a green card (coming from a relatively low lottery program participant country of Australia).<p>In these issues someone always raises the ""what about domestic workers?"" argument, which takes one of two forms:<p>1. Immigrant workers are taking jobs that domestic workers could do or could be trained to do; and<p>2. The increase in supply is dampening the earning potential of those in the field.<p>(2) might well be true but this isn't a bad thing. Doctors in some countries are scarce because the de facto doctor's ""union"" seeks to constrain supply, raising the cost of health care. For example, by restricting the number of university places in medicine.<p>Or, in Australia, runaway capital projects have raised the cost of construction to absurdly high levels, particularly in Western Australia, such that you really can't build a house for less than $300,000 anymore. Higher construction costs raise the cost of everything. This (IMHO) could ultimately paralyze the economy.<p>As for (1), speaking just about software engineers, there is a worldwide shortage of competent software engineers. There are (IMHO) at least 10 times as many masquerading as software engineers. I am shocked when I see candidates with 10 years of experience who can't write a for loop in the language of their choice on a whiteboard.<p>Given a worldwide shortage, it's better to have as many of them as possible.<p>As for entrepreneurs, frankly I think states should have the right to collect a special tax (in addition to other taxes) for anyone who wants to come to the US and start their business. That tax is to cover infrastructure and government services that person uses. Let them stay on that as long as they're willing to pay and until such time as they can shift to an immigration category based on the size of their business (these categories already exist).<p>Also, let the spouses of H1B holders have a job. I'm an Australian and on an E3 visa (specifically for Australian professionals). One advantage of this is the E3D (spouse visa for an E3 holder) allows that spouse to work. Just FYI.",1353905520
4830583,comment,4830291,4830291,1,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"Perhaps I am mistaken however no one is calling anything dead, they are simply switching strategies. In my opinion B2B wins hands down when the product could be used equally by businesses and consumers at a minimum.<p>When I started VisiDraft a year and a half ago, my strategy was B2B because my clientele would be using the product for work. I could as easily have structured my plan to have a consumer facing application but based on what I encountered it was a no brainer.<p>Microsoft, Apple, HP, IBM all of these name makers started as B2B companies. Why? Several reasons. You only have to sell to a few people, making your traction and revenues immediately positive. In addition, it allows a much more intimate feedback loop for iterations when you actually work hand in hand with another business designing solutions for them. you are basically getting another partner with domain expertise - you don't get that with B2C. It allows you to grow without losing a huge chunk of your business - in my experience most companies don't want anything to do with owning a chunk of a start up.<p>I am quite confident that no one is saying that B2C is over, and in fact a good number of software developments don't fit into a B2B model. Where there is equal ability to face consumers or other businesses, I will always opt to the business.<p>The last thing I will say is: Businesses around the world are sitting on +2T in cash right now. VC's aren't anywhere close to that and they rely on consumers to go buy things, which is looking pretty flat currently at least in the US. Go where the money is.",1353905505

It takes less paperwork and time to set up a bank account in a foreign bank and deposit funds into it than it does to start working in the same domicile as the foreign bank (unless one is talking about special cases like intra-EU or intra-NAFTA, and even intra-NAFTA is no picnic). If you have $0.5-1M or more to set up shop, it takes less paperwork and time to start a new business in a foreign domicile than it does to move your labor to the same domicile without the same level of capital (and in many locales, that level of capital garners you a PR card at the same time). At the moment there is asymmetric discrimination against labor mobility, and these calls for increased immigration-with-strings quotas from capital represent an even greater imbalance, hence where I suspect the ""cheating the system"" sentiment comes from.

I don't know. I am opinionated and a passionate advocate of better healthcare and increased scientific awareness. Sometimes I express my points of view.<p>Should all the evidence be available on all treatments - like, for example, on this blog/Cure page? Yes. But what this site is, in it's current incantation, going to lead to is impassioned descriptions of treatments based on belief, and not evidence.<p>Additionally, and again, I make the point that if someone is, for example, undertaking Traditional Chinese Medicine and 'Homeopathic Chemotherapy', whilst at the same time undergoing conventional therapy - Chemo and Surgery +- Radio, and the treatments are successful, the person involved is as likely as not to ascribe the success of their treatment to the alternative treatments than the conventional, evidence backed treatments.<p>Which gives the alternative treatments backdoor legitimacy, whilst having no efficacy of their own, and distorts the perceptions of those newly diagnosed that are desperately seeking help and answers.<p>So i am interested to see where this goes, how 'open source medicine' turns out and how it's put together; I don't think doctors should have a monopoly on medical knowledge; or feel that the only legitimate advice comes from the devotees of the cult of medicine (as it is often made out to be), However I will not be quiet about the dangers posed by unfettered access to 'folk' remedies and recommendations based on a n=1 sample size, or 'cousin's uncle's sister's gardner' type treatment recommendations.",1353903942

They have a points based system where expertise in rare specialized skills gets you further up the value chain as far as getting a PR card. However, I am not particularly sure how robust their system is when compared to the American system and whether that setup would scale when ported here.<p>> I don't like the idea of discriminating who can be an immigrant based on what they know - or the model of what their income level is (ie. foreign corporate bigwigs get easy long term visas)<p>I like the diversity visa personally and don't agree with the idea that the 50K visas that make America a truly diverse nation should be poured into the pool of visas for tech ( A majority of which are really people of Indian and Chinese origin). Also, yes, I have heard of people ""hacking"" the visa system by coming in as corporate managers from foreign nations and easily getting green cards as ""Aliens of extraordinary ability"". However, you will have to understand that the U.S. is extraordinarily paranoid of the idea of people turning out to be public charges which I figure is why this discrimination exists.<p>> I also don't like the idea that immigration is being sponsored to get lower wage workers for the same position, how can we insure that high-tech immigrants are paid the same as a domestic worker and not being taken advantage of?<p>Well that is interesting, because I suspect that does happen pretty significantly in the industry especially when people born in India and China are involved. The process takes multiple years and if I understand it correctly, there are points where you can't leave your job for fear of starting over and losing years in the line. This to me is a situation that is ripe for exploitation.<p>> The worst problem I see with all of this is the idea that American colleges are not producing people who would be compatible for these jobs despite the millions of people who go into debt to get higher education.<p>This is a societal issue. I am not sure legislation can address this. In third world countries, there is extraordinary pressure to succeed and getting an advanced degree is one of the easier ways to get into the middle class or maintain your position in it. This is important especially considering that there is literally no safety net. On the other hand, one can exist just fine either as part of the middle class or the lower middle class with a minimal skill set in the U.S.",1353903369

It might take ten years of no big hits, no outliers before they decide the game has permanently changed.<p>And besides, maybe the ROI is so good that it can take a 50% cut and still be better than anything else they can easily get involved in.<p>When big industries peter out, it's usually not evident until hindsight has been introduced what was the point where it was no longer worth committing any capital.  There is a lot of momentum pushing them along, particularly in very established demographics.<p>Eventually either a new way of earning cash from production will pop up, or, more likely, the returns to investors in entertainment will head back to the levels experienced by many other industries.  The barriers to entry for new talent will be lower (less gatekeepers) but the overall outsized returns to a small number of individuals will probably permanently lower.  Because it's hard to dominate an industry and make massive returns without structural, legislative or oligopolistic barriers to entry to competition.",1353902833

I just find it odd, that a project that made news headlines on [1] Ubergizmo, [2] Engadget, [3] LockerGnome by Chris Pirillo, [4] Coolest-Gadgets, Trendhunter [5] and others ... did not receive any more funding since I found it several days ago, where it was at $285 and it is still at only  $285.

When you're just starting out it is important to type accurately so that your fingers get the initial feel for reaching from wherever they're supposed to be, but after that you need to be careful not to plateau just because you're getting a few characters wrong here and there. Edit: In case it sounds like I'm just trying to argue, I'm not. Both approaches have their place on the learning curve, and depending on the method may work better than another. A typing tutor that doesn't let you correct mistakes should never be used for slow practice, for example.",1353902544

Which is morally indefensible but understandable at the same time..<p>I think a lot of people involved with medicine are under no illusions as to the limitations of our current methods.

247018,comment,246664,246664,0,0,kenver,,,"Some of those reasons seem a bit strange to pin on a technology that from my understanding has never claimed to be good at encoding binary data or none hierarchical data.<p>XML is used to create custom mark-up languages for documents, so why you would put binary data in it I don’t know, surely you’re missing the point if that’s what you’re doing.  Perhaps store a link to a binary file rather than encoding the binary inside the XML.<p>As for the verboseness of it, that’s a trade-off that you consciously make when you choose to use XML, if you want to use binary data and have small files then use a binary format.  You gain file size and efficiency loss, but you also get the added advantages of interoperability over hardware and software systems - which is probably the main reason you would want to use XML in the first place.<p>As for human readability, I don’t think the creators of XML claimed it to be readable like a book, but rather a human being could look at it and see language rather than gobbledygook!  It might be hard to understand when there’s loads of XML but it’s still 'readable'.<p>Editor problems aren’t really the fault of XML either, that’s a bit like saying a song sucks because you’ve got a rubbish CD player.",1216151758

I've heard people say ""we should have nuked Afghanistan, to show that we are not to be messed with... you punch a bully in the face, you don't talk to him trying to work out your differences.""<p>I've always felt that taking people out of ignorance will always make them less inclined to kill.

So, unfortunately, we're going to need a bunch of missiles.<p>I know it's hard to grasp, but there are people who do things like destroy <i>greenhouses</i> <i>of their own</i> out of spite or hate. If you give them a a voluntary choice, some people don't want peace; their agenda for how the world should be comes first.<p>You know, it's funny, one of the memes strong enough to change some dangerous people enough to be safe is Christianity, but the idea of converting Muslims to Christianity is met with extremely loud screeching about how we shouldn't do that and they should be allowed to believe the (uncivilized) things they believe now.

(Inaudible)  see, think about people who are willing to go forward to Iraq and Afghanistan to help insure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, so they can get the intelligence that they need. I believe these are the most noble people that we have this country. They are willing to put their lives on the line for their fellow  their fellow soldiers and fellow Americans, and other countries. And 20 of them lost their lives. And when you think about that, the issue is these same people who take that same oath to uphold and defend the Constitution (are?) the ones that run these programs. And we get all these allegations of what they could be doing. But when people check, like the intelligence committee, they found zero times thats happened. Thats no bullshit.

6271400,comment,6269314,6270192,4,0,baddox,,,"Yours is a fair enough argument, but I find the line you&#x27;re drawing to be arbitrary. We can conceive of a continuum of security mechanisms, each with a given strength which can thwart attackers with a given skill level. For example, near one end of the continuum, minimizing the browser when I leave should thwart a computer-illiterate attacker. Somewhere between that end and your suggestion of a master password is Chrome&#x27;s behavior, where the attacker must know that they can find your passwords in the browser settings. Near the other end might be biometric authentication, or even no option to save passwords at all.<p>A more sufficient version of your argument would attempt to show why the master password is an appropriate place to draw the line on this continuum, perhaps by arguing that it&#x27;s an optimal balance between minimizing the valid user&#x27;s frustration and thwarting some percentage of attackers.",1377420646
6271399,comment,6268401,6270264,1,0,temphn,,,"Interesting. What&#x27;s the best study you have, with scatterplots, that shows that the &quot;very old&quot; models performed &quot;very well&quot;?

Given that people who think differently from you invented Bitcoin (and thus have at least a glancing familiarity with advanced mathematics, if the solution of the Byzantine Generals problem means anything) it would be great to see some plots to the contrary. Not just models, but X/Y plots or tables in which Keynesians predict something and nail it. It&#x27;s not hard, after all to find many examples of Krugman, Bernanke, Goolsbee, or Orszag making quantitative predictions that turned out flagrantly wrong [1].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6038790"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6038790</a>",1377420643

If I have so much trouble that every time I&#x27;ve tried it, within a few hours I give up and install traditional Gnome, LXDE, or Mint with Cinnamon, I can scarcely imagine how bad it would be for a novice.<p>First of all, it crashes a lot.<p>Secondly, you have to use some magical key combination to start multiple instances of an application.<p>Thirdly, Unity has no easy discoverability of apps.  If I want to see what I have installed on my system using a traditional desktop, I can just read through the Start menu [1] and its submenu.  Unity has no way to do this that I can figure out.<p>Yes, you can type an app name, but a novice user might not know their Internet browser is called &quot;Firefox&quot; or their email client is called &quot;Thunderbird.&quot;  (Heck, when I started using Ubuntu, it took me a while to figure out that Totem was a media player, Nautilus was a file manager, and Vinagre was a remote desktop client.)  The point is that typing &quot;video&quot; or &quot;file&quot; or &quot;vnc&quot; won&#x27;t point you in the right direction.<p>In short, Unity sucks and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.<p>[1] I heard Windows 8 is ditching it too, at least by default.",1377420266

Many times they&#x27;re handled by something between you and the network library, often the operating system.  Sometimes they&#x27;re not handled <i>at all</i> at the system level (hooray, Android (until recent versions)!), so if you didn&#x27;t put a proxy in there, you don&#x27;t have one.<p>VPNs can also exist, but they sometimes send custom error status codes[1].  How do you handle those?  Retry if `code % 3 == 1`?

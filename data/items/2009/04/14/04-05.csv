561027,comment,560793,560793,0,0,zmimon,,,"I think it's very interesting that Google is brave enough to put this app out there from a security point of view.  They are letting any random stranger without registration etc., run code inside their sandbox.  For example, switch to groovy mode and enter:<p>println new URL('<a href=""http://www.google.com'"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com'</a>).openConnection().inputStream.text<p>You'll see it fetches the web page and prints it out.  So this app is now an anonymous proxy, of sorts, using Google's bandwidth to hit other sites.   Of course, that is just the first thing that came into my head, but it seems to me there might be many ways someone evil could use this either directly to do bad things or to try and hack the app engine sandbox itself.",1239685120

561022,comment,560596,560995,0,0,jballanc,,,"First thing I would say is that you don't have to code to get a job. The reason I classify what these individuals are doing as ""whining"" is because there's not a lack of opportunities, just a lack of the opportunities they expected to have.<p>Let's take, for example, the English Literature Ph.D. working at a Starbucks in NYC (I know a few...). Why are they there? Because they want to be in NYC. They want to be near the ""action"", by which I mean the publishing houses and big universities. Great! That's one choice.<p>Another choice would be to travel out to the heartland of America which is in dire need of educated individuals. Get a teaching position and set-up writing workshops, for the locals to improve their resumes even. Take up an interest in back-woods folk lore. --or-- What about other countries? I hear that the Czech republic is in need of professors. Poland, too!<p>You see, the problem is that college coddles people (or at least, it did me), and graduate school coddles people. It's not that these individuals can't go out, be creative, try something daring, and maybe fall flat on their faces a couple of times. No, instead, working an 8 hour shift to go home, change, hang out at the bars the ""writers"" hang out at, and desperately try to sell that novel to yet another publishing house is, let's face it, comfortable. Sure, there's a chance at success, and some people willingly make this choice.<p>The bottom line is: if the years upon years of education you've received can't somehow be turned into good fortune in the absence of an obvious path forward, then what good were they in the first place?!?",1239684351

It looks like a McDonald's character. I'm guessing you wanted something relating to ""critter"". Something less literal would probably be a better match with the concept of the site. Overall the branding is a little more casual than I would go for, but that part's up to you. (What's up with the weird quotes at the bottom?)<p>UI, I'm referring to the webpage around the flash. It's a little hard for me to tell because I'm on FF2/Linux now and the site is kind of janky, these are some things I'd change:<p>- On the homepage, the buttons don't look like buttons.<p>- On the homepage, the way that the black line follows the borders of the buttons is ugly. Maybe it's the aliasing. If you're going to have that line at all, the horizontal should align with the vertical center of the buttons, instead of some arbitrary point.<p>- On the learning interface, the horizontal lines extending to the left of the flash are totally arbitrary looking.<p>- Too many thick black lines. Use contrast to control where the user's attention is drawn. Right now the front page goes logo -> description -> buttons/nav-menu (ignoring the video). Should be description -> buttons -> nav-menu -> logo. Part of this should include making the buttons and nav menu look more clickable.",1239684133

As noted, suspending aspects of mark-to-market undoubtedly helped their bottom line. And who knows how much of these ""profits"" were the result of one-time payments from the government via AIG. There is so much opacity with all banks' financial statements that trusting them seems unwise. Wells Fargo claimed they had record profits in Q1, and just today an analyst estimated that Wells actually needs at least another $50 billion.

It is not a journalists's role to oragnise campaigns; it is to inform the public. If the public is then roused to a campaign, so much the better.<p>I also find the account of the waiting lists for whatever fashionable bar rather distasteful given the context.<p>Look, I haven't been to Dubai. I don't know whether the Independent piece was a valid description of the society or not. But the kind of rebuttals I have seen are unconvincing. What kind of rebuttal would I find convincing? Some of the Westerners that live there saying ""I have a maid. She holds her own passport. She is paid a living wage. Her working conditions are hard but not inhumane"". Or: ""I am a contractor working in Dubai. All my workers hold their own passports. We have these and these arrangements to ensure they are not asked to work in 50 degree heat"".<p>There is no reason to make this into a religious issue; the article was far more critical (in my eyes) of the Westerners that flock to Dubai than of the local population.

560998,comment,560632,560632,0,0,dkarl,,,"If you tried to achieve a 19th-century standard of living on twenty hours of work per week, you would face three problems.  First, many aspects of the 19th-century standard of living would be quite cheap nowadays, but are illegal.  19th-century-quality housing, sanitation, food, and medical care can't be legally provided today.  Second, if you did manage to live a 19th-century lifestyle, you would probably be psychologically unable to cope with having a lifestyle so materially inferior to the people around you.  Being denied comfort and medical care enjoyed by other people when you were in distress would offend your dignity.  Third, even if you did manage to cope psychologically, you would be unable to participate meaningfully in society, because other people would draw conclusions about your strength of character or mental stability.<p>The only way to achieve Marx's dream would be to make a society-wide decision to apply productivity gains toward leisure instead of towards the material standard of living.  But guess what:  most people <i>like</i> to work, and everyone <i>needs</i> to feel productive to be psychologically healthy.  I'm sure that was easy for someone like Marx to overlook when pondering the plight of people who were brutally overworked, but it changes the equation quite a bit.  Plus, productivity translates into power, and everyone has a certain appetite for power.",1239682909

We used Guncam, which is a pretty out of date capture program mostly intended for capturing in game footage, because it has the highest capture fps unlike camtasia and its ilk. The problem with Guncam is that it's really resource intensive at 24fps, so we were really restricted in how much of the screen we could capture.

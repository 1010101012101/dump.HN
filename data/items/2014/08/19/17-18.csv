8198773,comment,8197281,8197281,7,0,saosebastiao,,,"One of the more disappointing aspects of this go-around of delivery services is that they don&#x27;t seem to have learned anything about logistics. Logistics is not just solving the Traveling Salesman problem.<p>If I could miraculously solve a TSP in linear time, that would be an amazing accomplishment. But what good does it do you if the fixed costs of loading and unloading at each node are in the 5 minute range? That limits you to a hard max of 12 deliveries per cycle with the quoted 1-hour cycle time. At that N, even a shitty algorithm with off-the-shelf heuristics would suffice.<p>Furthermore, logistics is far more complicated than just transportation; It heavily depends on sortation. If I have someone shopping for 1 person, there is no sortation problem. As soon as I tell that shopper to pick for 2 orders, I introduce a sortation problem, as those two orders need to be kept separate. And the sortation problem becomes a distribution problem: Do I have the shopper pick a list of items and then later sort them into orders? Do I have the shopper pick into different baskets on the same trip? Do I send the shopper on different trips for different orders? Distribution tradeoffs absolutely matter...distribution affects the level at which an atomic sortation action takes place. With wildly different costs for different types of sortation actions, ignoring this potential for optimization could be deadly.<p>They don&#x27;t seem to have learned much about economics either. When considering the costs of making a delivery, you can be assured that the variable cost components is weight/volume/highway-distance, and the fixed costs represent the cost of the last mile. Using this simple rule, you can extrapolate (or interprolate) the costs of a given amount of market share. To appoximate the fixed costs of delivery, get the cost of sending a tiny item to your neighbor. For example, sending a postcard via US Mail (with US Mail representing an approximate 99.9% market share and delivery density) costs you $0.34. To do the same with UPS, you are typically running into the $2.00 range. UPS has a much lower market share (delivering to maybe 5% of all addresses in a given delivery day). And UPS has $50B in revenue! To make matters worse, these companies (at least instacart) are promising one-hour deliveries. This means that the delivery vehicle physically cannot contain all of the items of two orders where one is placed at 0600 and an order placed at 0700. The implications of this are huge. If UPS switched to this model, sending out a new truck every hour, you can rest assured that the $1-2 last mile cost would balloon to the $20 range, because you have now reduced their delivery density proportional to the number of trucks you have to send out. The costs of the last mile of delivery are so dominant that they are the reason why fixed-price postage works as a pricing method! If you need 100% market share to reduce your last mile delivery costs to $0.34, and 5% market share to reduce it to $2.00, where does that leave Instacart? They are away from UPS size by several orders of magnitude, and they promise hourly deliveries on top of it! They have the right philosophy (growth matters), but that is a bit like saying that if I keep building my sand castle, I can eventually reach the moon.<p>In my opinion, Instacart is DOA. Hopefully, the next time this trend pops up, they&#x27;ll hire some experienced OR professionals from the very beginning.",1408470955

So, although most skills-based practice (such as music) benefit from daily practice due to the way the brain adapts, this has to be somehow balanced against the body&#x27;s need for recovery.

I would recommend Thomas Kurtz&#x27;s &quot;The Science of Sports Training&quot; but I found most of it impractical and incomprehensible.

Not only do you introduce a whole host of problems, but it&#x27;s more difficult to <i>parametrize</i> the problems that are introduced. So you could easily create a study that boasts a large sample size, with a respectable p-value[0], but have no way of knowing which confounding variables were introduced during the data collection process.<p>A third option is self-reported data, which comes with an even bigger asterisk after it. For something like this, I&#x27;d much rather trust a controlled study of 50 than a self-reported survey of 300 (at that point you might as well post it as an &#x27;Ask HN&#x27; and judge based on the comments!).<p>By contrast, while controlled experiments on human subjects are by no means unbiased or immune to confounding of variables during data collection, it&#x27;s almost always easier either to limit these in a controlled setting or at least to parametrize them after they happen.<p>So in the end, this usually ends up being the best <i>feasible</i> option (not the best (theoretically) <i>possible</i> option), short of massively increasing funding to such studies.<p>[0] Which is usually the wrong way to look at studies anyway, but that&#x27;s a separate topic of discussion",1408470420

Eventually consistent systems can give you durability, isolation, and atomicity, but it&#x27;s typically hard to reason about, because the interface that&#x27;s given to the user is some sort of multi-value, vector-clock tracked thing, and it&#x27;s hard to reason about.<p>Datomic can manage a commit protocol under the hood, and deal with causality tracking without requiring the developer to &quot;get dirty.&quot; It&#x27;s query language is declarative, and doesn&#x27;t provide the same implicit guarantees that SQL queries need.",1408469976

And that is actually a pretty good way to explain it. When I first found LimeText (about a year ago) I was searching for an &quot;open source ST2 clone&quot;. I already knew that I wanted something like Sublime, I just wanted it to be open source so I could contribute to it. Having to compare the features of LimeText to the ubiquitous features of Sublime would have just made it harder for me to &quot;get&quot; what LimeText is.<p>> because he has the gall to charge $60<p>I don&#x27;t think that the 60USD was a big deal. I was fine with that, I just wanted something that&#x27;s open-source.<p>> weird that the fact that it&#x27;s made in Go is part of the pitch<p>I think that the reason why is because LimeText is marketed towards people who want to contribute to their editor. Sublime is probably a more stable solution for people looking for something like Sublime, so right now the big feature is that it&#x27;s open-source.<p>* Also, I should note that I&#x27;ve never used LimeText... I ended up switching to Atom instead. My primary experience with it is just finding it and evaluating it as an alternative to Sublime.",1408469318

Looking back at some of the projects I worked on when I was just starting out as a professional developer, I can tell you without a doubt that I introduced technical debt. It wasn&#x27;t because of time pressures, I had plenty of time, it was simply because I was so green that I didn&#x27;t know any better.<p>For example, I built a distributed video transcoding system a few years back, and for the use case at the time it worked great. But let&#x27;s say people want a new video format? That&#x27;s a large rewrite. Want to add more servers into the worker pool? That&#x27;s a large rewrite (the code was written to assume a 1:1 ratio of certain servers, which was dumb).<p>Basically anything that you might want to change was made harder by the code that I wrote to get the job done initially. Over the years you start to recognize that, and write your code a little smarter and more change tolerant (hopefully introducing less technical debt).",1408468008

The car has a reaction time of T, a resolving distance D, and a hazard confidence H. These are the robot car&#x27;s motion constraints for that moment in time, the options available to the car are a function of these constraints. The robot car should never ever be intentionally operating in a state where solving for the constraints means the available option of one death or another.<p>In the case of a child and a narrow tunnel:<p>-As you enter the narrowing path P (without even considering the child at this point), your path options are reduced to 0. You cannot consider the option of a change in path any more, unless you consider death by wall an option. (reverse would first require a change in V)<p>-The car can see and resolve objects and environment up to distance D, and should be designed to be able to stop within that distance. If it can&#x27;t stop within its resolution envelope, that is bad design. Unless the child pops up from behind a boulder when the car is 10 feet from the tunnel entrance, the car should detect the child from a long way off. That scenario, however, is like someone jumping in front of a train.<p>-The route chosen by the robot car should have a hazard level associated with it. The robot car&#x27;s hazard confidence will be affected by its current position along a route and proximity to route hazards, by its proximity to other car&#x27;s traveling in the same direction, and detection of other hazard signals.<p>-Given all the constraints, and since only speed V can change, the robot should not be operating at a speed where it has an OPTION of killing the child or the car occupants.<p>TLDR: Drive slow approaching a narrow road, otherwise you give yourself no options.",1408467973

The bones bend a little, just a little, more than straight and there is a muscle that can pull on the other side. This locks legs in place when straightened, but still maintains a spring-like mechanism protecting the weak points in the bone structure (because it&#x27;s not actually straight, it makes an angle).<p>A baby is actually too weak to hold himself up. I&#x27;m not saying that that&#x27;s the only problem, but his muscles are certainly not capable of holding his body off the ground the first 2-3 months. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to put them on their belly (but not leave them like that for more than 30 minutes or so), and ideally try to help them crawl, roll and walk, even when they can&#x27;t.

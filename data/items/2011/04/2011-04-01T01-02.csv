I guess gnu grep is naively converting back and forth between representations? There's nothing in UTF-8 that should prevent it from doing this efficiently.

However, I'm very glad that it has come to our attention.<p>Airbnb operates as a trusted community marketplace that thrives on community engagement, not anonymity. Building trust is not an easy mission, but it is a mission to which we very are committed. We have very stringent quality and conduct control standards that we require both hosts and guests to abide by. We rely heavily on direct feedback from our users through our community support team and transaction based reviews in order to remain a trusted place for people from around the world to book, list and discover unique spaces. We find the behavior of this host to be unacceptable and have since followed up with them directly. We invite anyone who has similar experiences to reach out to us directly in these instances, which we take very seriously.<p>As mentioned by someone else, taking payments offline is not something we allow our hosts to do. Hosts, if they so require it, have the ability to charge cleaning fees and security deposits through our service, allowing the guest a seamless, safe and secure booking experience. Our payment process was designed to prevent fraud and scams which are rampant on other sites, where payments are often sent through the mail between strangers, with no recourse.<p>Instances like this remind us that we have a long way to go to making Airbnb the best place in the world for people to find the space they need. While we are disappointed that you had a bad experience, we truly appreciate your honest feedback, which challenges us to keep building to achieve our mission.<p>Christopher Lukezic, Airbnb employee",1301620991

2394533,comment,2392592,2392592,2,0,bch,,,"Where to start...<p>I guess we can start w/ the age of the last version that was used (clue: had no namespaces). That places it squarely pre-8.0 (8.05 was released early 1999). Rehashing a twelve year old language? (For reference, Tcl is shipping 8.5.9 now, and Tcl 8.6 is in beta, under active development).<p>Lots has gone on since, then; Glancing at the article, first thing that jumps out is complaining about Tk not looking nice. Tk has had ""Themed Tk"" for some time now (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl#Tile.2FTtk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl#Tile.2FTtk</a>). The difference is remarkable.<p>Regarding quoting -- not much more to say than Perl or /bin/sh, for example.<p><pre><code>  {prints $a... literally}\n\n  ""prints: $a <--- value of 'a'""\n\n  ""prints: [glob *] <--- the result of the glob cmd (a list of files)""\n</code></pre>\nBasically, substitution works for ""double quotes"", but not for {braces}. (But, dig into Tcl and there are more creative commands at your disposal, like:<p><pre><code>  [subst -nobackslashes -nocommands {this is content of variable ""a"": $a}]\n</code></pre>\nAnd this: ""...although everything is a string and it should be very easy to stick things together when that is what you want to do, in any scenario which is even slightly complex you have to start writing list operations in order to build your strings"". What's wrong with:<p><pre><code>  set a ""oh""; set b ""hai""; puts ""$a $b"";# easy-peasy (I'm a comment)\n</code></pre>\n""Tk’s layout procedure does a lot for you automatically, which in practice means that it’s a pain to do anything else.""<p>Tk has 3 layout engines...pick one. If you're having a lot of trouble, you're doing it wrong.<p>The beauty of Tcl and Tk (which thankfully still exists today) was largely glossed-over, which is too bad.<p>* The Tk system...is a very clever way to easily write a GUI program.<p>* ""Tk is cross-platform."" (of course, so is Tcl). Win, Mac, BSD, Linux, Solaris, etc., etc.<p>* ""...the actual Tcl implementation is great."" Still true.<p>* ""has a nice event loop"" Still does... and threads, and co-routines (8.6), and lambdas, safe interpreters, utf-8 support, tcp sockets, ""tdbc"" database connectivity (8.6), built-in OO facilities (8.6)...<p>* ""The core library provides system independent facilities which are well designed and well implemented."" Still true... a joy to work with.<p>So there you have it, an ad-hoc response to a review gone wrong.",1301620914

So if you plan to launch a new game, you can add an cross promotion unit and promote other apps. When you are then ready to launch your new app we will then give you back the impressions that you gave to the network pre-launch. Its a bit different from what you are doing - but same type of concept. All in all, great to hear tips like that - more power to independent app makers :)  Best, henrik at allify",1301620909

He appeared to still be moving under power, and had power steering. When the Roadster's battery runs low, it drops into a low power mode, with a dramatically lower top speed and crippled acceleration. You'd have to endure ""limp home"" mode for a couple dozen miles before the cell-protection circuits kick in and shut everything down.<p>Which would be bad.<p>Lithium ion cells are twitchy, excitable beasts at the best of times, and like to burst into flames when abused. The Roadster's battery is liquid cooled, and if the pack is completely discharged, then the coolant pump will stop running, which could result in the entire thing going Fukushima. Just completely discharging a pack will dramatically shorten its lifespan, (The Roadster's is only rated to 100k miles) which isn't something Tesla wants to be done to US$109,000 worth of car which the BBC did not, in fact, own.<p>So it dropped into low power mode, and they switched cars, and they had a nice dramatic shot of it being rolled into a garage, something that would be unpleasant enough for a gasoline car, but would almost certainly be a multi-thousand dollar maintenance catastrophe for an electric one.",1301620334

By then you'll know what to do.<p>The reason I would say this is my usual spiel about not actually encouraging people to do really time-wasting things, even though we have a culture of ""encouragement at all costs"". Encouraging a novice mountain climber to take on Mount Everest as their third mountain isn't friendly, it's evil. Encouraging someone to write their own new programming language if they don't have the experience to do it of course won't <i>kill</i> them, but they sure can waste a lot of time. Whatever you think they may learn from the experience can be learned faster and more productively by first reaching the standards I wrote out above, and actually taking <i>advantage</i> of the fact that much ground has been mapped out already.

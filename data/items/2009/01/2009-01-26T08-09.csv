I think this has a long way to go.<p>If banks get deeper into trouble and smaller countries have to rescue them, eventually people will ask whether those countries are going to default and who gets hit by that and so on.",1232960328

I don't think that is disproved by Apple's success.",1232959977

However, if you're selling technology, like in the example given at the end of article, technical excellence may carry a higher payoff. Another example: id software selling their engines to other game developers.",1232959958
450177,comment,449670,449839,0,0,mikeyur,,,"That is extremely stupid, to me anyways. The argument posed when other carriers tried to do it here is that the company was double charging for the service - which stopped a lot of carriers from even attempting to implement the incoming charge.<p>Another thing that's crazy is the cost of your txting plans/packages. My mom and sister are on $25 plans here and get unlimited txting included for free.",1232959955

450175,comment,450167,450167,0,0,fbailey,,,"We are working on something in that area in Germany, Kijiji doesn't compete because it's ebay. That's my personal opinion. They chose the worst name ever and they don't have their priorities clear, it's not a ""used goods"" market with enforced standards it's just a market.<p>The basic problem in this area is reach, but that's not a problem or ebay so asking why kijiji fails is not going to answer your questions for a startup.Different situation different problems.",1232959827
450174,comment,449670,449722,0,0,RK,,,"As a side question, what is the current roaming situation in Europe?   The last time I had a European phone (a number of years ago), it was very frustrating to have to pay very high roaming fees as I was traveling in different countries.  I think I had gone with Vodafone, which at the time seemed to have the best prices and the largest network.  Coming from the US, where almost any plan allows you to call coast to coast with no extra fees, it was frustrating taking a train for a couple hours and then having to pay 1.50 euro/min or similar.",1232959826

I came across it because I'm looking to get a second dog.<p>So, why isn't it competitive with Craigslist? If I knew the answer to this question, then it would make me a better hacker and entrepenuer. Is it just because Craigslist was first? I think that's a facile answer.<p>Y-Combinator is looking to fund a Craigslist competitor, but before they do, they should ask themselves this same question, and the corollary - if not this site, then what would it take to unseat, or even compete with Craiglist?",1232958316

To make this possible, broadband subscribers would pay a nominal fee of as little as £1, or $1.38, a month to their Internet service providers. [...]<p>Under his proposal, the money collected by the Internet providers would be sent to a special agency that would distribute the proceeds to the copyright owners, including the record labels and music publishers. They would receive payments based on how often their music was downloaded or streamed over the Internet, as they now do in many countries when it is performed live or on the radio.</i>",1232958034

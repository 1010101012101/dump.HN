In other words, if you write a Lisp application, using Allegro CL, and you deliver it to a customer, then the customer effectively has a copy of Allegro CL. Franz wants to be compensated for this. If you wrote a server-side product, then Allegro CL is expensive, yes, but you just pay for the number of licenses you need. No royalties, as far as I know.",1218130921

In the suburbs, where people are more spread out, chains rule.<p>Part of that is zoning.<p>But, how many of those stores are bookstores?  How many of them would have sold food if Webvan hadn't screwed the pooch?<p>Frankly, I don't see the appeal of small stores, especially for things like drugs and food.  The prices are higher, the selection is smaller, and they tend to have lousy hours (unless they're liquor stores).

2023945,comment,2020508,2020508,0,0,iuguy,,,"I'd split it to create a diverse portfolio of investments, some high risk high return, some low risk but long term. If I couldn't get a return exceeding the cost I'm paying on the mortgage, I'd put the cash into the mortgage to lower my outgoings, then take the difference and invest that instead.<p>The rationale behind that approach is that you'll save money by not paying interest, the amount you save is largely dependent on what you owe and the interest you're paying, but you're probably paying more mortgage interest than what you'd get out of most savings.<p>I'd also buy some precious metals (Gold, Silver etc.) and a safe. Not a gold bug, but it'd be good to fall back on if I need the funds, plus it will appreciate over time.",1292842111

And put the tray into the oven while it preheats.<p>For the dough...
Instead of room temp water use cold water (even ice cold water). For the second rise, leave it in the fridge overnight, the idea is to let it rise slowly for a long period of time.<p>After 2 minutes of pizza being in the oven. Spray with water, I just use the garden water spray. You want mist rather than a pool of water.

Compare that with a snapshot of the old OS (before reinstallation), <i>running on the new hardware</i>. Generally, unless the hardware is really old, reinstalling Windows will get you a snappier system back.<p>If you're using an old HDD, consider swapping for a SSD.<p>If a little more performance is needed, consider overclocking the CPU by 15-20% if that's possible (a cpu cooler is much cheaper than a new machine).<p>Additionally, you should disable all graphic ""special effects"", Aero and other crap that comes with Windows.",1292841307

It's the equivalent of me donating 20 bucks to charity and then going around telling everyone. If they were doing it purely for altruistic reasons then they wouldn't even mention it. It definitely has a commercial purpose behind it. It's better than them not doing it, but don't fall into the trap of believing it's purely altruistic.

It makes sense, given that HN is read by many people who think like engineers, but in another recent thread on /r/math, people are talking about how the reason mathematicians study mathematics is not because it is useful, but because it possesses an inherent beauty/logic/whatever that makes the people who study it want to keep studying it. I'm doubling in math and CS and I have to say that the reason I am studying math is not because of any potential applicability to work I might do in software later in life, but because it has an allure for me that is unmatched by almost anything else.",1292839926

I believe it was £10/year. Even when facebook came on the scene, they continued charging users.<p>(Yes, charging users directly, however much 37signals etc trumpet it, is sometimes a very short sighted bad thing to do, particularly when free competitors arrive as they invariably do if you have a reasonably sized market).<p>So facebook <i>did</i> happen in the UK.

What I wanted to say was that without the isloated red points we might get to see more structure in the data, becuase we could expand the range.  I may yet do that, and make careful notes in the text and annotations to explain it.

2023912,comment,2022952,2023852,0,0,omh,,,"From my brief conversations about Office licenses, I think that the Home Usage licenses are a side effect of the per-machine licensing policy for Office. Microsoft explicitly say that you need an Office license for the machine that you're sat at while running it, so if you're accessing a Citrix server from your home PC then that home PC needs an Office license (even if it's not running Windows).
That means that the sort of places buying Enterprise agreements, with large VPNs, need a license for all of the PCs at home. So these basically come bundled once you're buying enough.<p>I assume that the £10 cost is just for the media (rounded up a little!).

At some point I've got a suspicion that people don't use the service as they don't want to expose themselves.<p>As for why you can't do that on facebook/twitter, you can of course. The only thing which is missing is the framework to ask people (put together a nice page with images), collect the results (some server-side thing to record votes), and present them (a results page). Should you decide to make it yourself, I doubt that you'll have it all up and running in less than an hour, which is far more expensive than $2/$10 that I'm asking. Sounds reasonable?<p>One other aspect is that you get opinions of people that are non-geeks and just tell you what they like without thinking about how things are made (colors, composition etc). Fellow professionals or friends / family tend to give their extended opinions which aren't always ""welcome"".<p>And finally, many will find easy to collect a hundred of votes, but others will not.

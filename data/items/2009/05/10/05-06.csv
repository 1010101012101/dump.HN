601859,comment,601784,601851,0,0,Tarks,,,"As far as I'm aware they're almost universally 3 years (unless they include a placement year). I'm basing this on anecdotal evidence such as what I remember from applying to different universities and the fact that most of my friends are graduating a year earlier than myself.<p>We also don't have nicknames for the years here, though I wouldn't be surprised if we start adopting it, we already have an official event called ""freshers week"" in the first week of the first year.",1241935124
601858,comment,601211,601211,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"Ok - I know I may be downmodded for this but wouldn't it just make more sense to switch to an editor that maybe <i></i>doesn't<i></i> cause you RSI problems?<p>All I'm saying is that if you have to go through so much  pain and trouble to use a piece of software then just maybe it's not right for you.<p>Also I'm not suggesting Vi but Emacs has a pretty good Viper-mode that may help with RSI issues. I use EMacs with Viper and I can pretty much work with minor hiccups when I switch from Vim. Just a suggestion.",1241935039

601855,comment,601800,601836,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"Excellent advice Mahmud.<p>Also I'd guess Zaid is an expatriate - simply because I've noticed this tendency to put down India mostly among ex-pats (in the US and UK).<p>I'm a native and I love India. I've had chai at a dozen houses and shops and I never dreamt of feeling suspicious (and nothing happened to me either).<p>EDIT: To clarify my last statement - many shopkeepers will offer you tea when you are buying something from them.",1241934469

601853,comment,601784,601842,0,0,sachinag,,,"This is not the way it works at any reputable college I've ever heard of here in the States.  I've been on many recruiting teams and cumulative GPA is always done as a straight average over credit hours (which are typically evenly distributed over each of the standard four years).",1241934307
601851,comment,601784,601831,0,0,sachinag,,,"Ah - it functions the same as a summer internship between junior and senior years here in the States, although it is for a full year.<p>Question - are your college degrees three years or four years?  Ours are generally four, called freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior.",1241934165
601850,comment,601784,601838,0,0,sachinag,,,"You always want to do well, but if you don't do well early, you can at least point to improvement in your later semesters as you ""got the hang of"" college.  This improvement is also helpful for graduate schools, although a magic improvement senior year is not as good as steady improvement over the years.<p>Traditionally, full-time hiring is complete for good employees (in all disciplines) by the winter break of the fourth (senior) year, where there's some clause that you can't get terrible grades in your last semester.",1241934094
601849,comment,601568,601736,0,0,Mgreen,,,"When coding a flash app, keep all interface elements externally as an imagemap(an external png with UI elements in it and an xml which defines the coordinates of ui elements in the png). Then reskinning would require only updating the imagemap rather than recompiling the swf.<p>By hiding the flash core ,basically they are exposing the flash apis to javascript .This would be helpful for frontend developers who are not comfortable with flash, but want to build a decent mp3 player .Other than the advantage for developers , i dont really think there is any functional advantage for the end user.",1241933951
601848,comment,601800,601827,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"I'm happy you are re-thinking your suspicions - India is big and diverse and you can really meet some very nice people if you give them a chance.<p>Of course you can also meet some really horrible people but I think it's the same anywhere in the world. You have to keep your guard up a bit when dealing with total strangers.",1241933888
601847,comment,601800,601800,0,0,mahmud,,,"When traveling out of your geo-cultural zone of comfort, eat what the locals eat: their diet will most likely contain the nutrients you need to adapt to the climate and resist prevalent diseases.",1241933780
601846,comment,601572,601572,0,0,zubin71,,,"the first two comments mentioned by mahmud are very interesting; real good advice for any programming beginner.",1241933736
601845,comment,601572,601572,0,0,zubin71,,,"after making a few API`s using java, after coding in c and cpp for about two years, i moved on  to explore the capabilities of various other languages. i took me about 6 months; but it was well worth the time. \nI suggest you try out networking projects; maybe a chat client coupled with a file transfer mechanism; or maybe a P2P file sharing project. \ni don`t agree with the comment which says ""mischief motivated you like none other"". it is true that many are interested towards activities like circumventing security systems, but as long as you do not understand the fundamental concepts behind the working of a particular exploit or shellcode; you`ll be wasting your time and will remain a script-kiddie learning little or nothing.",1241933586
601844,comment,601662,601819,0,0,dantheman,,,"I don't know if apple allows demoware like that, but I think that's a great idea.  I like to try before I buy, I've seen a lot of software with descriptions and demos that do not match reality.",1241933415
601843,comment,601572,601602,0,0,mlLK,,,"<i>Just take a GUI library, a network library, a regex parser, a mime/XML/html parser, and an audio library; taken into any combination, you will have something that solves an interesting problem. Something as ""big"" as a web server can be written with just the system calls built into every unix :-)</i><p>Great advice; unlike an artist who is burdened with a blank canvas, a programmer does not share this burden. You don't need to start with this <i>blank canvas</i>, instead heed mahmud's words and get your finger-tips dirty with some libraries and modules as a place to start.",1241933354
601842,comment,601784,601838,0,0,Tarks,,,"As a rule it's because the years have different weights assigned to them, so as an example first year counts towards about 20% of the final degree classification, second year 35% and third year 45%<p>EDIT:<p>Just to help avoid confusion I'll reiterate that this is talking about universities in England",1241933312

601840,comment,600968,601796,0,0,bokonist,,,"Limited liability is simply a matter of contract between the lender and the owners of the corporate structure.  When a bank lends money to an LLC, the contract is that the bank can only seize the assets of the corporate structure, not of the owners.  If the bank does not like this deal, they can refuse to make the loan.  In fact, many banks will refuse to lend to small LLC's.  They will insist that the owner pledge his own assets.<p>Another way of thinking of it, is that equity holders hold the most junior debt.  The idea that senior debt holders could come back and make the junior debt holders pay up more is ridiculous.<p>Now, I do think that owners (and bond holders) should in some cases be liable for third party torts and criminal activities of the company.  I don't know what the actual law is about this issue.  If there is never any liability, that's a mistake.  But I doubt that's the case.",1241933075
601839,comment,601784,601790,0,0,Tarks,,,"Option 1 is financially viable and probably what I'll end up doing. Looking for entry points from which I could transition upwards is something I will definitely look at after graduation.<p>Thankyou !",1241933073
601838,comment,601784,601814,0,0,nop,,,"Enlighten a European. Is there some reason you put extra focus on getting good grades the last year, do employers focus mainly on the last year grades?<p>(On a related note, I have to find a placement of open source nature for my second year as it's my major. :P)",1241933032
601837,comment,601784,601834,0,0,Tarks,,,"I completely agree, which is why I'm looking for neither. I don't think it's too crazy to be looking for a place where I can learn from other people practising the same craft.",1241932804
601836,comment,601800,601827,0,0,mahmud,,,"Zaid, I'm guessing you're a native Indian, am I right? let me tell you this, what you're describing is a native's caution: people do that everywhere, they're less impressed with where they live.<p>If this is a cup of chai offered to you in good faith, by someone whose house you stumbled upon, then pretty much drink it and enjoy. Indian Chai will be made fresh and poured hot on front of you. Your host will get himself a cup as well.<p>Don't drink if the rest aren't drinking; not just out of caution, but also human decency. People in the East are quite hospitable, and the very poor might offer you what little food they have left. If you're given a plate of food or a cup of tea, call the kids over and tell them to dig in, insist, or leave some left on the plate .. it's not rude.",1241932775
601834,comment,601784,601784,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Honestly, and I don't mean to be rude here, but I think you're living in a dream world right now. The chances of getting funded at school age or finding the perfect job given the current economic climate are next to nil.<p>If you can afford to finish school I'd do that. Otherwise I'd take what you can get job wise and ride out the storm (while obviously keeping your eyes open in case you get really lucky and the perfect job comes along).",1241932685
601831,comment,601784,601814,0,0,Tarks,,,"Some universities offer what's known as a sandwich degree. in which at the end of your second year you have the option of spending a year in industry, the idea is that the student gets real world experience (and is able to put this on a CV) and the employer gets a very willing young worker to help with tasks. You find that after graduation a lot of companies re-hire the students they had on placement.",1241932573
601830,comment,601779,601779,0,0,khandekars,,,"Interesting.<p>Composing a decent poem becomes natural after composing a thousand and throwing all of them to /dev/null. Past that stage, the problem isn't of inspiration, but of distilling the output. Mortals tends to begin attain maturity after 10K.<p>The cognitive benefit outweighs poegling, since the patterns of neurons firing in your brain aren't restricted to the computer UI calisthenics.",1241932571

601827,comment,601800,601800,0,0,zaidf,,,"First, a word of caution: if you are offered a cup of chai at any of the train stations, I'd avoid it. I know at least two immediate contacts who were offered chai at a train stop. The tea put 'em to sleep for a while. And they woke up to find a lot of their stuff missing.<p>Having said that, it's funny to read this perspective. I lived my first 10 years of my life there and if someone invited me for a cup of tea, I'd be very suspicious. The stories leading to my suspicion are endless and could be recited by most Indians.<p>And then I read an account like yours and it makes me rethink all those ""moments"" of suspicion, some probably more valid than others.<p>Still, be careful! Have lots of fun! And always watch your back:)<p>In general, living in any kind of large city for a PROLONGED time makes you more cautious of people, I think. I lived in San Francisco for a year and my outlook on random people was very similar to the snap judgments I'd reach about people while growing up in India.",1241932277

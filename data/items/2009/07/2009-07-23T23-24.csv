720573,comment,718132,718872,0,0,thwarted,,,"That's how I define luxury also.  To solidify it a little, I'd say that a luxury is something that may or may not provide utility but that isn't a commodity.  Once it becomes a commodity, it's not a luxury anymore.  Consider the evolution of telephone features:<p>1 you can just dial a number, you keep a hardcopy list
   of phone numbers of common contacts
 2 phones get the ability to show caller ID, just the
   number, not any associated name
 3 as part of becoming portable, phones include a simple
   contact list showing names and numbers that you can
   select to dial
 4 the contact list is used, along with caller ID
   functionality, to show the name of the caller
 5 the contact list gets the ability to store address book
   style information also, which is not directly related
   to any other feature of the device (the phone).
 6 the contact list is maintained portably outside the
   device, allowing integration with additional services
 7 the phone gains the ability to communicate via IM
 8 the contact list is used to store unified information
   for all contacts, IM and phone, and not have separate
   lists independently in each phone feature.<p>At any earlier stage, the later stages seem like luxuries until the majority of devices have that feature; then it's not a luxury anymore, it's a necessity.  Who's going to buy a smart phone these days that doesn't have some kind of unified contact list?  Not having it would be a major hindrance, but lack of hindrance, utility, doesn't make it a luxury or not.<p>There's a pop culture definition of luxury, as you point out, like dangly watches, that serve no purpose other than to show off.  That's the most baroque kind of luxury.  There's also a more pragmatic, utilitarian luxury that is not absolute but changes based on the market and availability.  Few people would consider the utility of an indoor outhouse to be a luxury, despite the fact that its main purpose is also served by an outdoor outhouse.",1248390448

When something like RNA polymerase goes through DNA, it <i>always</i> goes to the physically closest nucleotide. Sure there is a ""link"" between bases in the form of molecular bonds, but this bond only works between nucleotides right next to each other. No nucleotide can bond to a nucleotide farther away, and have a polymerase follow that bond.<p>If DNA were a linked list, it would basically be one where every element is adjacent to the next one in memory.

That way insertions and deletions are much easier.<p>DNA works much more like an array. The ""index"" for a gene is the promoter sequence at its beginning.

If by <i>index</i>, you mean the reference we use to access an element of an array, that is just the physical location of that element in memory with the offset  of the array subtracted.  (High-level languiges do math under the covers to simplify things for the progammer, but that's basically it.) Lists use the exact same information., except they contain it literally.<p><i>Lists are perfect, because they already contain the previous and the after information bit, which is always crucial to us -- we all are enclosed in the time barrier -- and all of other memory alignment and usage, invented by computer scientists, were simply born out of the necessity of speed, and nothing else.</i><p>No , they  were born because they are much simpler to implement and imagine than linked lists. They continue to be used be used becaue they are faster simpler, and use less space than linked lists.<p><i>Nature only uses lists.</i><p>No, Nature uses neither lists nor arrays.

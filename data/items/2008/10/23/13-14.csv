His blog is beginning to look like it is hosted by INET-WEB: <a href=""http://www.inet-web.com/creativeGeniusWebDevelopers.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inet-web.com/creativeGeniusWebDevelopers.asp</a>. Jokes aside, the danger I see here is that people might presume that when he says ""marketing,"" he means bombarding people with gaudy images and superficial ornamentation.<p>That is <i></i>not<i></i> marketing. And furthermore, Jeff ought to know better.

341154,comment,340397,340656,0,0,jcromartie,,,"The ""dial-a-salary"" idea would be great.  I wish I could work less sometimes, but I have always worked at companies that have a limited amount of ""unpaid time off.""  If you take off more than X days during a year, you are fired.  Period.  Firing someone for requesting a voluntary pay cut?  Ridiculous.<p>I guess it's probably related to the reluctance to let people work from home.  It's about keeping up the image.  A corporation doesn't want people to let on to the fact that sometimes there isn't as much work to do, or sometimes there is really no need to physically be in an office building.",1224770155

That condescending tone (""I'm sorry to be blunt"" ) - we have to deal with it all day, every day.<p>Other examples from my recent professional roamings - with 13 years experience as a professional programmer, and 2 years at my current company, I had to justify a line of trace that I had in my code.  You know what, I'm a big girl now, and can decide for myself whether or not a line of trace is needed in an app, and I have never seen a male colleague (even those much less experienced than myself) have to justify such minor decisions.<p>Or what about the guy on my floor that decided that as there were only two women on my floor, that he could share our toilets, after all, ""why should you get a toilet all to yourselves"".<p>You see, rubbish like that hits women in the face all of the time in the tech industry.  Even those of us that love programming can find all of these little insults to our persons a bit wearing.  I mean, I'm on this site precisely because I've had enough of having to justify myself to male colleagues, and have decided that I'm going to head out on my own.",1224770010

341149,comment,340658,340994,0,0,Zev,,,"How many apps legitimately need launchd to start up?  I can only think of a few apps; Little Snitch, VMware Fusion, iStat and, possibly tablet and printer services. The rest of the stuff, well, Adobe doesn't need to launch a process at boot for me to use Photoshop.<p>OS X is not Linux. launchd is not cron. Don't treat them the same way. There's better way's to autostart an app then (ab)using launchd. Look at the Shared File List API in Leopard or having your app do a quick search with Spotlight to find the files and delete them. You could even name it ""Reset Preferences"" for the user if you don't want to have a big ugly ""Uninstall"" button in your program.<p>Apps shouldn't be using launchd in the first place.  So there should be no need for an uninstaller.",1224769820

They expect that by putting in time irespective of their actual work product they should be rewarded.<p>Young people on the other hand expect to be judged and rewarded based on the quality of their work product itself and how much value it contributes to the company.

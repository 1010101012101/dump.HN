88901,comment,88814,88814,0,0,downer,,,"> <i>like ""How do your reverse an array without a temporary variable?""</i><p>You hard-code it using XOR.  Note you can't even do a for-loop, as that's using an extra variable.  Of course hand-unrolling a loop takes extra memory because it's so many extra lines so there's no point.<p><pre><code> a ^= b
 b ^= a
 a ^= b
</code></pre>
This is very unlikely to be something that occurs to programmers who haven't had to XOR recently; if you aren't writing your own hash or crypto or codec functions then you probably haven't used it in a while.  Now that you've seen this, you'll remember it and so if anyone asks, you won't be figuring it out again, just recalling.<p>IMO it's a pretty useless way to weed people out, kind of like testing people on chess by random arrangements of pieces.  Chess experts remember actual legal positions that occur in games much better than non-players, but they are no better at remembering positions that never occur -- a bunch of kings on a chessboard, some in adjacent squares, for example.<p>Likewise, this kind of pattern NEVER occurs in what most people program; it's just implausible.",1197500150

Doing it based on the colour of their skin is just the most egregious.<p>I've met white slackers, I've met chinese pot heads and I've worked with black men who humble me with the grasp of subjects I'm considered an expert in.<p>It's just a stupid (and I don't use that word lightly) way to judge someone.",1197499922
88899,comment,88745,88792,0,0,sanj,,,"I agree with your synopsis, but I disagree with the premise.<p>Any writer knows that there is nothing more terrifying than the blank page.  In social networks, it is the empty friends list.<p>All of that 'pseudo-user-generated' data that is pooh-poohed gives a new myspace page a warm and fuzzy feeling that is would be missing from a ""build-it-yourself"" network.<p>It reminds of Joel Spolsky's take on Jakob Neilsen:<p>""Every time I read Jakob Nielsen,"" I wrote in 2000, ""I get this feeling that he really doesn't appreciate that usability is not the most important thing on earth. Sure, usability is important (I wrote a whole book about it). But it is simply not everyone's number one priority, nor should it be. You get the feeling that if Mr. Nielsen designed a singles bar, it would be well lit, clean, with giant menus printed in Arial 14 point, and you'd never have to wait to get a drink. But nobody would go there; they would all be at Coyote Ugly Saloon pouring beer on each other.""",1197499733

88892,comment,88843,88843,0,0,downer,,,"This is kind of the point, as most start-ups are mostly technical people who only appoint one of themselves as CEO because <i>somebody</i> has to be.  It's not a question of ability but of desire; lack of experience is obviously to be expected, and you could never get any NEW CEOs if that were a disqualification.  Every CEO was a first-time CEO at <i>some</i> company.",1197498803

Even video games have multi-year development cycles and double-digit-millions budgets.<p>$6m in 3 years isn't high at all.  Lots of little pre-revenue start-ups have sold for more with many fewer assets than it sounds like this company has.  Google's first big round was $25m IIRC, and that was pre-keyword advertising; and by today's standards that's a tiny amount.  Good thing its investors didn't panic and pull the plug.",1197498524

The resistor in an A-to-C cable is basically emulating the signal that would otherwise be provided by the host.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;1.5A C-to-C cable&quot;; all type-C cables are required to deliver at least 5A. The limiting factor is the host, not the cable, which means the cable <i>must not</i> incorrectly advertise capabilities that the host doesn&#x27;t support.<p>> Never mind that a C port has so many extra pins compared to a A or B port, that one would think that id-ing a A-to-C cable would have been as simple as looking for life on any of those extra pins.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what the new CC pin is used for. Right now the spec says &quot;legacy cables should connect CC via a 56kΩ resistor&quot;, but it wouldn&#x27;t matter if instead the requirement had been &quot;legacy cables should leave CC disconnected&quot;; the issue is that cable manufacturers are ignoring the spec.",1454446733

RVs, or any large vehicle purchase, are not wise uses of limited incomes. RVs are money pits even for those well off enough to keep them going all year.<p>Each story was the same, things go wrong and then they double down on making bad choices. Basic income isn&#x27;t going to save these people, it might just make some less mobile, so they will be out of sight and people won&#x27;t feel guilty any more.<p>We already transfer a fortune from the young to old in this country, doubled down on it with the prescription acts during the Bush presidency and then doubled down again with the ACA during Obama&#x27;s presidency.  We cannot save everyone, especially when they keep repeating the same mistakes.<p>Want to help those with limited money, the solution is not to give them more money. The solution is to get the government off their backs. When their income gets below a certain threshold we need to back off the taxes, fees, and similar, they pay or go to jail for or lose property for. I have no problem fixing their medical needs but the last thing that will help is to promote their continued wandering which forever prevents them from establishing themselves.",1454446687

So let&#x27;s write a constructor for #Person, we&#x27;ll put it on the &quot;Person class&quot;, or the Person&#x27;s class side as it&#x27;d normally be called.\n\n\n      Some Smalltalk&#x27;ers prefer to write their constructors in a different style, one that enforces encapsulation a bit more, by not allowing public setters for all the instance variables, like so...\n\n     Person class>>firstName: aFirstName lastName: aLastName\n    ^(self new)\n        initializeFirstName: aFirstName lastName: aLastName;\n        yourself.\n\n      Person>>initializeFirstName: aFirstName lastName: aLastName\n    firstName := aFirstName.\n    lastName := aLastName.\n    relatives := Set new.\n\n    Smalltalk is not so much a language, as an extensible notation for creating languages. To rip off a famed martial artist, empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like Smalltalk. If you put Smalltalk into a financial application, it becomes a custom finance language. You put Smalltalk into a shipping application, and it becomes a custom shipping language. Be Smalltalk my friend.</code></pre>",1454446681

The $2.83tn fund is invested in federal debt that pays 3.4% interest. So the interest payment (from the Federal government) of $96.2b is enough to cover the deficit.<p>By 2020, interest will no longer be enough to cover the deficit between revenue in from taxes and expenditures out to retirees. At that point, the SS fund will need to start redeeming treasuries for cash. The federal government will then need to issue new debt and/or raise taxes to cover SS treasury bond redemptions.<p>If the Federal Reserve follows through in its quest to raise interest rates and inflation, it will be relatively expensive to raise the $2.83tn in debt that we will need to fund SS through 2029, when it is projected to completely deplete its reserves of treasury notes. At this point, SS will only be able to pay out 75% of promised benefits given the current tax rate and demographic trends.<p>Healthcare expenses lean heavily towards the old but are funded by the working age population. What happens as the birth rate decreases and the average individual lives longer? Expenses increase for the working-age population.<p>I&#x27;m less concerned about spend on education (which is broken) than I am about how we plan to fund our health care and pension systems. The only feasible way I can see is through increased taxation. I just started working last year.

11022215,comment,11020883,11021897,0,0,tzs,,,"> Luckily as a ham, I believe I can at least operate my Part 90 radio on Part 97 bands.<p>I believe that is correct (also a ham).<p>For curious non-hams, here is how it works. In the US, generally there are three ways radio bands are licensed.<p>1. No license is required for the operator to use the band, but the equipment used must be certified for operation in that band.<p>2. The operator has to have a license to use the band <i>and</i> the equipment must be certified for operation in that band.<p>3. The operator has to have a license to use the band, but can use any equipment as long as what is actually transmitted meets the legal technical requirements for operation on that band (power levels, modulation types, and so on).<p>An example of the first method is the Family Radio Service (FRS) bands.<p>An example of the second method is the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). When I say that the operator has to have a license, that does not necessarily mean that the person actually operating the radio has to have a license. With GMRS, for instance, a business can get a license and that covers employee use without the individual employees needing to get licenses.<p>Ham radio falls under the third method, and offhand I can&#x27;t think of anything else that does. When a licensed ham is operating a radio all the FCC cares about is what comes out of the antenna, not what equipment produced it.<p>The way hams get licensed is also quite different. The FCC takes a very hands off approach to ham licensing.<p>To get a ham license, you have to pass an exam. For the entry level license, that is a 35 question multiple-choice exam that almost anyone here on HN could learn enough to pass in a couple weekends. There is a license level above that which gives you access to more ham bands, which you get by passing another 35 question exam which is a little harder. There is a third license level above that which allows you full access to everything hams are allowed to do. That one is a 50 question exam and is quite a bit harder than the other two.<p>The FCC neither makes the exams nor administers them. They have authorized 14 organizations as &quot;Volunteer Exam Coordinators&quot; (VECs), and the VECs are responsible for maintaining the pool of exam questions, constructing exams from the question pool, training and certifying people to give the exams, giving the exams, grading them, and reporting the results back to the FCC so the FCC can issue the licenses.",1454444582

It is in fact fun for normal people to act like a dick, in the same way that it&#x27;s fun to shoot roadsigns or piss on the sidewalk.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t do these things is a mixture of training (we all know doing these things will make society worse off, perhaps we personally don&#x27;t like it when we&#x27;re driving along and a roadsign has been shot up), consequences (people will probably think less of you for urinating on sidewalks, it&#x27;s illegal, etc) and maybe a healthy dose of inbuilt aesthetic and moral standards, empathy (how much and to what extent these really end up resulting in object-level actions as opposed to determining on what axis object level actions will be inhibited doesn&#x27;t seem clear cut to me).<p>People who are willing to go around dominating and exploiting others for the sake of mere petty cruelty are <i>unpleasant</i>, the common term is &#x27;bully&#x27;. Few people would want to be on the receiving end of it. Most people find this behavior less than charming. There is also the element of personal danger, who wants to be around somebody that might manipulate them for fun? So it makes sense to play up how different we are from such people, because that shows others how righteous and safe we are to be around. However as the child with the magnifying glass who burns ants shows, the capacity for petty cruelty is within all of us.<p>[0]: There are some behaviors which are pretty much reserved for pathological people, but the set is probably smaller than we imagine.",1454443768

At least, I would like to believe that anyone who watches sports would agree with this statement. Moreover, a game played with unfair rules is by its nature an unethical game. That&#x27;s my opinion on the matter.<p>If in society it were made clear that copying everyone else&#x27;s designs and market research were okay and to be sought when possible, then there would be little wrong with an open-source project copying the designs of a proprietary project. On the other hand, if a proprietary project is not allowed, in practice, to copy the designs of its competitors due to fears of legal problems or public backlash, then it would be unethical for an open-source project to copy other projects&#x27; designs since that would give the open-source project an unfair advantage.<p>At the same time, there is still an element of exploitation if in practice the only ones investing significantly in market research and R&D are the proprietary firms. After all, any time someone is reaping the benefits of someone else&#x27;s work without giving back equally in one form or another, there is a type of exploitation going on.<p>Now, we should avoid thinking in black-and-white. We should avoid saying x is ethical while y is unethical. In the real system that is society, there are many variables involved, and these variables are floating point. You would need to plug all the values into the formula of ethics to really see the relative balance of ethics followed by any given project or company at a given time.<p>I can tell you from my own experience with (embedded software/hardware) R&D that coming up with a fully functional, reliable product in terms of design and approach is a <i>very</i> costly operation. Simply measuring and cloning someone else&#x27;s product is worlds easier than designing it in the first place. After all, the people doing the R&D are filtering out all the bad ideas for you -- and most ideas are bad ideas, often for reasons not clear from the start.<p>Like I said, however, one of the most important factors to consider is whether everyone is playing by the same rules. Doing things your competitors are not allowed to do without getting into trouble is cheating. And cheating is unethical -- despite the inner animal in us thinking there&#x27;s nothing wrong with cheating as long as we&#x27;re the one benefiting. Remember: The question is not whether you <i>can</i> do it, but whether it&#x27;s <i>ethical</i>. These are not the same thing.",1454443730

Quad was the first video tape format and was replaced by much cheaper/smaller/quieter/better helical-scan tape. Very few Quad machines still function, and as far as I know there is exactly one guy[2] who refurbishes them. (I worked under him for a summer job in college 25 years ago when Quad was already long obsolete). Not sure if anyone will take up that business once he retires.<p>Makes an interesting real-life example of the problem with archiving anything for a long period of time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_videotape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_videotape</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.zinvtrworks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zinvtrworks.com</a>",1454443376

Only the NFL could profit from it, but by then the game would be freely available.<p>I&#x27;m also curious about the reproduction of &quot;the work&quot;. If I write a symphony, that arrangement of melodies and instruments is mine. If you &quot;performed&quot; my work and recorded a copy of it, that copy is yours. I would probably take issue with you profiting from this copy without my consent, seeing as I own the IP rights, but what rights does writing the symphony give me over a performance of the work. If a school orchestra decides to perform my symphony and a proud parent records it, how much right do I have to the contents?<p>The analogy is rough at best. I use it to point out that there was effort in the production and maintenance of the copy, so the NFL may still not have the right to broadcast that &quot;private production&quot; without Haupt&#x27;s consent, even if it were made public in an academic venue.<p>This is similar to how a fan&#x27;s cell phone recording of a play belongs to the fan, even though he can&#x27;t go about selling copies. If the NFL got ahold of the cell phone video, they also wouldn&#x27;t have the right to broadcast it just because it&#x27;s a recording of their IP.<p>Copyright law gets complicated and I&#x27;m certainly no expert.

The ex-NFL lawyer makes it sound like a slam-dunk on the &#x27;NFL owns the property on the tapes&#x27; subject, but I&#x27;m not sure the NFL could compel the venue to hand over the property itself when no crime has been committed (and won&#x27;t be due to the Fair Use exemption).<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of copyright reform in several different aspects, which is why these are interesting cases.

That means a large swath of &#x27;programmers&#x27; (whom this notebook is apparently supposed to be for) are not going to have access to it.  Thus the whole thesis of the title is invalid.

8450015,comment,8449740,8449942,0,0,pfg,,,"Pointing out that just using Tor without changing your behavior might not be enough is definitely important. Using a separate piece of hardware that&#x27;s dedicated just to routing all your traffic through Tor still has a lot of security benefits, since it limits the target surface just to Tor (and the OS stack required to run Tor), as opposed to your browser, OS or any other software you might use that could potentially leak your true identity.",1413226764
8450014,comment,8448426,8449853,0,0,xorcist,,,"If you want to argue that, at least get your facts straight first. In Europe, the stronger welfare states of Northern Europe and Scandinavia has had much stronger economies during the financial crisis. They have also had much better success retraining their work force when industrial jobs has been lost to the cheaper Asian countries.<p>There are many reasons why (most of) Europe is in a depression right now. One of the important ones is the financial crisis that started in the US and spread across the world, where European banks were invested up to their ears. Another is the former tiger states of Ireland and Portual, where low company taxes attracted money which was invested in a real estate bubble which popped when the economy tanked. A third is the Euro experiment which didn&#x27;t really pan out the way politicians had hoped (to put things mildly).<p>So there is a whole complex of reasons for the current situation and no one can really point out any single one as more important with any confidence. But one of the few things we do know is that welfare states have generally fared better in the crisis, not worse.",1413226760

8450011,comment,8448929,8448929,0,0,nkurz,,,"I always wonder how much weight should be given to the accuracy of &quot;irrelevant&quot; details.  I tend to believe that spotting small errors that seem obvious to me mean that there are likely other larger errors that I would recognize if I were more knowledgeable about the subject.   I presume that if the author isn&#x27;t concerned or knowledgeable enough to strive for accuracy in the minor details, they are more likely (intentionally or not) to make errors in the major details.<p>In the case of this video, Monbiot speaks of &#x27;deer&#x27; and then shows pictures of American Elk (Cervus canadensis).  This is defensible, as he&#x27;s British, and the European Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) is very closely related and likely more familiar to his anticipated viewers.  But midway through, the video cuts to pictures of a Mule Deer (Odocoileus hemionus), which an expert is unlikely to conflate with an elk.<p>This could be considered an &quot;irrelevant&quot; detail, but one of the major differences is that the American Elk primarily graze as they have a digestive system that allows them to efficiently digest grasses, but the Mule Deer do not:  they eat some grass, but primarily &quot;browse&quot; on woody vegetation.  So while they will both have an effect on streamside vegetation, it&#x27;s going to be a very different effect.<p>In a piece that purports to explain the science behind the cascading effects of wolves on the ecosystem, this feels like a disconcerting blunder.  Should it cause me to doubt the credibility of the piece as a whole?  I don&#x27;t know.  But it makes it more difficult for me to treat Monbiot as an authority on the topic.",1413226647

8450001,comment,8449680,8449680,0,0,yuliyp,,,"The viewpoint the author seems to expound reeks of second system syndrome. That is, he seems to argue that incremental evolution is broken, since the state at any given point is suboptimal given what someone building from scratch would build, having all the lessons of hindsight with them.<p>Of course it is. Yet computer science history is full of overly ambitious projects (Plan9, Vista, Lisp) falling by the wayside as inferior solutions which were more incremental continued to chug along. The author didn&#x27;t stop to consider why those failed, only to blame a myopic community; as if Lisp being better would have proven itself if only more people gave it a chance.<p>Incremental changes are how we progress. We take the lessons we have learned from what we&#x27;re doing now, and then try something a little bit different. We can&#x27;t try and redesign everything at once, so we pick a few things, and other compromises get left in. Compromise is an essential requirement to getting anything big done.",1413226465

The other is the user interface for the person doing the page layout.<p>A constraint solver interface is a good match to a GUI. It&#x27;s not a good match to a textual interface.  Web designers should be using a layout tool like Dreamweaver, not hand-coding constraint expressions.<p>For an example of a constraint-based tool for a much harder problem, see Autodesk Inventor, which is a 3D CAD system.  It has 2D sketches, and those are controlled by constraints.  You can draw rectangles, and if they have coincident points or edges when drawn, those are constrained to stay together. You can explicitly dimension something, and it becomes that length.  If you try to apply inconsistent constraints, the system rejects them. You can make all constraints visible as icons, then delete any you don&#x27;t want.  Web designers would probably love the power of Inventor sketch mode, because it&#x27;s not restricted to horizontal and vertical lines, or even to straight lines.  That might be overkill for web design, although being able to wrap text around a curved image would make some people happy. Inventor demonstrates that a much harder constraint problem than web design has been successfully solved with a good GUI.<p>Asking visual designers to write constraint expressions by hand is pounding a screw with a hammer. Use the right tool for the job.",1413225770

Everything inherits from Object which has the following prototype:<p><pre><code>     public class Object\n     {\n     		public Object();\n     		public string ToString();    \n     		public bool Equals(object obj);\n     		public static bool Equals(object objA, object objB);\n     		public static bool ReferenceEquals(object objA, object objB);\n     		public int GetHashCode();\n     		public extern Type GetType();\n     } \n</code></pre>\nSo if you want to just do strings you still can (string will inherit from type object, and must implement toString()).<p>However if you want to do a List<Object> you still can, and better still the receiving process can use GetType() which has to be implemented, and then have a few different workflows to handle the type (e.g. List, string, et al).<p>UNIX was created in 1969(!) so nobody can blame them for designing it the way they did. However if you were creating UNIX today you&#x27;d definitely want to look at OOP and inheritance as a core pillar.<p>See this post for this topic:     \n<a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.07.powershell.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.07.powershe...</a>",1413225718

The actual process forking behavior seems useful in only a small set of cases that could be handled by spawning a process and passing state explicitly.  The benefits of fork() don&#x27;t seem to offset its costs or justify its widespread use.<p>fork() is one of those things that&#x27;s conceptually quite elegant but in practice has too many problematic edge cases.

If you ask any alumni, you&#x27;d know that we spend most of the time during the program to tell startups NOT to even think about fundraising. 11 weeks of the program is focused on them talking to users and building stuff. Only the week before Demo Day do we start working with them on their presentations to investors and fundraising strategies. This is because the best way to fundraise is to actually build something that people want and then just show the evidence to investors. I have no interest in helping people manipulate or trick others into giving a startup money. Also, it almost never works. The most persuasive startups are usually the ones pitching the truth.

Well to start, what are the basic inputs and outputs of the business? What is needed to transform those inputs to the outputs in a manner that is efficient, adaptable, safe etc. Are there common groups of people that tend to work on common inputs and create common outputs ? Within those groups, are there specific people needed to do specific tasks? Imagine person A, in group A, needs an output from person B in group B. Does person A need to know exactly how the output was created?

The calories in the cake contribute 1000x more to your body-comp than the cherry.

7232296,comment,7223578,7225547,2,0,jp555,,,"> You mentioned there is very little other than fat in beef but don&#x27;t forget that there&#x27;s mostly protein.<p>No, I meant that the experiment I linked to didn&#x27;t test fat&#x27;s insulin stimulating ability in isolation. I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest there&#x27;s little other than fat in beef.<p>Testing the various amino acids would probably not be very useful. Do not subjugate fundamental principles to minor details. Which is also important when considering the effects of insulin. Basically it&#x27;s not important at all as long as you don&#x27;t eat too much food. Eating appropriate amounts of food is a fundamental principle; worrying about insulin levels is a minor detail.<p>>  I think it means we should be careful to eat small portions of meat or limit how often we eat meat.<p>No, it does not. That may be confirmation bias at play. Are you a vegetarian/vegan? Remember that one of insulin&#x27;s roles it to move nutrients from the bloodstream and into cells. beef is a <i>very</i> nutritionally dense food; you would need to eat 5 pounds of broccoli to get he same protein in an 8oz steak (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100g+steak+vs.+1000g+broccoli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100g+steak+vs.+1000g+br...</a>). So it makes sense that when more nutrients enter the bloodstream, more insulin is required to move it all into our tissues. Carbs are the macronutrient &quot;closest&quot; in form to cellular fuel (glycogen). It takes a LOT more work to use protein as fuel than it does to use carbs. This is known as the &quot;thermal effect&quot; of food; how much energy is required to convert food into cellular fuel. .... and now I&#x27;m rambling... :P",1392309664

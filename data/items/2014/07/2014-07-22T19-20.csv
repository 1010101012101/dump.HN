8071242,comment,8070801,8070801,7,0,exratione,,,"So back when I was running numerical simulations of pop III stellar evolution (which is rather a long time ago now), the interesting thing is that, in comparison to pop II and I, the extreme metal paucity means that you can have (a) stable and extremely long-lived very dim, very small stars, verging on being warmed up gas giants, and (b) very large and extremely short-lived stars, which will supernova or otherwise give way to instability on the order of a few million years after core ignition.<p>You can then work back to speculative mass functions (distribution of mass in the population) by asking (a) how many large, short-lived stars you need to generate the observed metallicity of pop II, and (b) how many extremely small dim objects you&#x27;d need to fill out the missing mass without having so many that someone would have seen them by now. The latter is an interesting line of thinking; what is the upper density bound on (for example) 0.1M objects to make both the solar system&#x27;s continued existence and an inability to see these things plausible.<p>You can also look at the paucity of candidates for ~1M extremely low metallicity stars (there are just a couple out there known that could be pop III candidates) as another constraint on the pop III mass function. Any pop III ~1M stars would have a lifetime longer than that of the universe to date, or at least such was the case in my models.<p>Research on missing mass and pop III has moved on considerably from those days of course.",1406059074

Even if they could land the stage softly enough with a reasonable amount of parachutes, the stage has trouble surviving tipping over in the ocean after landing.  It needs to land and remain upright, but using parachutes you will often get some lateral velocity that would cause a tip-over.

8071213,comment,8069893,8069893,3,0,debt,,,"Budgeting is particularly interesting in a situation where you receive funding. It seems it would be much easier to budget in a bootstrap situation, where growth is likely happening a bit more slowly. You&#x27;re slowly adding a person(engineer, marketer, salesperson, etc.) here and there as you go along(as needed), buying more servers, etc.<p>I would assume budgeting is a bit different in a situation where you receive a <i>massive cash infusion</i>. You want to spend all of it to grow even more quickly but the effects of spending may be harder to measure(<i>because you&#x27;re spending soo much soo quickly</i>). So do you just replicate the growth strategy used in the &quot;bootstrap&quot; phase or do you adopt a new one?<p>In a situation involving a massive round of funding(relative to the current size of the company), wouldn&#x27;t it be difficult to attribute any problems supposedly associated with the increased budget to a &quot;bad budgeting process&quot;? That is to say, if the growth isn&#x27;t happening, then there&#x27;s no guarantee that just by adding more money to &quot;growth&quot; that &quot;growth&quot; will happen. You may have just pointlessly hired managers, salespeople, engineers and bought more servers and whatnot, for growth that wasn&#x27;t going to happen in the first place.<p>To put it a different way, when the profits don&#x27;t catch up with spending, was the problem really the budgeting process? Or with the market itself? Or some other factor entirely?<p>Basically, <i>how do you identify a bad budgeting process in a situation where some entity just externally infused a bunch of capital</i>?",1406058845

The startup mentality of &quot;embracing constraints&quot; is more than just a rationalization that tries to turn a negative into a positive...it&#x27;s an observation of how to best creatively problem solve.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt that over-constraining can also have negative consequences, but if you&#x27;ve got little to no natural constraints, it&#x27;s almost always best to invent some reasonable constraints prior to diving in and trying to solve the problem. It&#x27;s okay to document those constraints and, perhaps, make changes if you find the problem you&#x27;ve created to be intractable. But operating without those constraints, whether real or self-imposed, is the absolute worst way to approach any creative problem solving endeavor.",1406058570

8071168,comment,8070737,8071147,17,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Even though I am an advocate of procedural generation, I concur that this is a problem with procedural generation.  Even though one algorithm can create millions of permutations, they are all based on the same algorithm (for example, you can vary the size and distance of Worley noise in many ways, but in the end it looks like variations on the same type of noise).  For each really new thing you want to produce, you basically have to create a new algorithm to produce it.  You can often combine algorithms (say, combining simplex noise with worley noise to produce rocky terrain), but there are only so many interesting ways you can do this, and so many ways you can do it that won&#x27;t break your game.  You can&#x27;t go wild adjusting the parameters, because 99 percent of the results will look like junk, so you often have to restrict yourself to meaningful subsets of the parameters.  Really, it gets pretty close to manual generation at some point, because there is so much human input.  Even if you were creating creatures, simply varying the amount of limbs would only produce so many interesting results.   Then you have to code separate algorithms to generate eyes, horns, claws, skins, fur, etc -- and then make sure that every generated permutation looks ok.<p>Edit: to add an additional distinction, I am referring to the generation of visual content here.  You can do much more in an emergent (AI-driven, state-based, or chaotic) system and produce surprising results, although you still fall into the dilemma of making sure that all resulting permutations look/function correctly.",1406058200

And what if you choose to think about and do other things instead of fixating on possible negative outcomes after you think of them?<p>You can learn to observe when you&#x27;re fixating on negative outcomes so that you can change how you think and thus how you feel. If your brain is a Ferrari, learn how to drive it. I recommend looking up the &quot;Ten Twisted Ways of Thinking&quot;; I&#x27;ve seen those patterns of irrational thinking again and again in the intelligent depressed people I&#x27;ve known (myself included), and learning to recognize them and deal with them makes a huge difference. Just because you&#x27;re extremely intelligent doesn&#x27;t mean that all of your thoughts are correct or valid or worth thinking about, but there&#x27;s also no reason to express internal anger at yourself for having an irrational thought. I had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder several years ago, but after learning to watch my assumptions and when I&#x27;m fixating or about to fixate on negative outcomes, I no longer meet any of the criteria for that diagnosis.<p>That said, I also get no sense of achievement from anything, but I do enjoy continually learning more and doing more because it keeps my mind busy on positive outcomes.

But in a normally functioning society, good (normal) people don&#x27;t really notice that the police are there. They understand the rules and they try to stay within the rules. The rules mainly prohibit things they wouldn&#x27;t have done anyway, like cheating in a multiplayer game or distributing the game to hundreds of other people for free. That&#x27;s not infringing their rights in any way, I&#x27;m sure you can agree. This is how Steam works.<p>However, bad DRM exists. You have to authenticate to their servers every time you play, you have to stay online all the time even in a single player game, if their server goes down you lose your games, they can take your games away from you whenever they want. The DRM is noticeable from the beginning because of the bureaucracy the lack of trust that comes with it. You&#x27;re being punished just for the fact that you exist. You have to install rootkits or shut down/uninstall programs on your computer. There&#x27;s no benefit to you other than the fact that, after they have been satisfied, they let you play the game. That DRM is like a police state. That DRM, however, does not describe all DRM. This DRM describes Sony&#x27;s DRM, or SecuROM DRM, or Games for Windows Live.<p>See the difference (probably not)?

The reason is, transmission of three-phase/AC is much more efficient than DC. DC has also other side effects like they are not potential free (hard to explain for me in English as I am German.)\nBut to make it easy, beside the electrical stuff, the whole world is based on AC. So redesign stuff like TV, dishwasher, computer, … just for the few poeple who run their own system is economically not possible. (The hen and egg problem.)<p>The other thing is, everything that runs with a drive these days, like your electric car with a permanent-synchron drive, needs to convert DC to AC to run the drive. The AC frequency defines how fast the drive runs.<p>So even, if the first thing change, the second (running a electric drive) will not change.<p>Besides from those points, I find this contest interesting. Because, I thing in the industrial world, where I am working in, this kind of problem is addressed every day in electrical engineering.<p>EDIT: for the grid, it is not only solar, also wind energy is important. Wind parks are the next big source of renewable energy, in Germany (of course), but also in Spain, China, and the US. GE Wind Power is very strong in the US, AFAIK. With wind power AC is generated with the frequency depending on the wind. So this AC is converted to DC, which then is converted to AC synchronized to the grid. Actually, the market leader for those inverters is based in Nuremberg, Germany, where I am from. AFAIK, they have more than 60% of the market. Because moving such high power requires 3 or more inverters in parallel. But running such things in parallel is a pain in the ass. Because they have to run with less then 1ms accuracy in parallel.

8070935,comment,8069903,8070528,2,0,krapp,,,">But it seems US citizens want to live like that. Why?<p>Well first, not all US citizens do.<p>Primarily this seems to stem from a free-market, conservative viewpoint. Central to this viewpoint is the thesis that not only is labor just, but the sociological outcome of labor is also, always, just (unless the government interferes). In other words, those who can afford healthcare have earned the right to it, those who can&#x27;t were simply to lazy or ignorant to work hard enough to afford it.<p>Also, there can be a deep aversion to the government (any government) interfering with a person&#x27;s property and income, where any program which requires people to give for the &quot;greater good&quot; is seen as not only theft, but an existential attack on the fundamental ideals of American individualism and personal liberty. The argument here is that governments are by definition corrupt, fascist and incompetent, and only a free market with as little regulation as possible could handle something like &quot;healthcare&quot; efficiently and fairly.<p>Therefore, advocates for limited government will see social programs as interference by an increasingly &quot;big government&quot;  regime which has no right to force a moral imperative on people or relieve them of their property, and conservatives and free-market believers will feel that social programs undermine the moral principles of capitalism while insidiously creating a dependent class of lazy left-wing radical neo-immigrants.<p>Also, it&#x27;s probably worth mentioning that not many Americans appreciate that there is a difference between liberalism, socialism and communism, and nor would they care.",1406055738

But I don't like the proposed solution of giving away money; that fosters dependency.<p>I think the best approach is a personal one.  Friends I've had who were poor were sometimes poor due to circumstances beyond their control, but most often they had just never learned how to live differently.  They hadn't been taught how to handle money.  They didn't understand budgets.  They ate fast food; we cooked.  They bought tons of toys; we had fun money, but it was tracked and budgeted.  They bought pre-packaged sausages; we bought potatoes.  They failed to pay bills for months on end, constantly fighting fees and debt collectors.  We tracked and budgeted everything.  For some of these people, it was totally lifechanging just being friends with my family--seeing how we ran a clean household on a shoestring budget, and saved money.<p>A poor person who's good friends with a not-really-poor person has a lot of advantages.  Not-really-poor can alleviate some of the worst pain of poverty: help out when they need a lift or a dinner or an advocate or a place to stay.  But the major advantage is lifestyle modeling.  Poor can see what Not-Really-Poor does that makes it all hang together, that solves all the problems at once.  And he sees how he could maybe get there himself.<p>Economically mixed neighborhoods, a sense of neighborliness, hobby groups (say, gaming) that cut across social classes and create friendships.

At least for Opera, they have been right up there, or as long as I can remember, as the most standard compatible browser. Yet their browser market share never went above 1% (statcounter). And they are still making it better, recently developed the fastest JS engine.<p>My point being. I can't trust a company/developer who is reactionary to the market share and their profit line as opposed to doing their job good in the first place.

Axioms and definitions simply exist, but we are not therefore obligated to suspend all judgment on which ones are better for some purpose.<p>I can reformulate all of physics to accept the Earth as a constant reference frame. It will be isomorphic to current physics based on being set in inertial reference frames, and therefore every bit as ""correct"" as conventional physics. There will be no place where conventional and Earth-centric physics will disagree about the result of an experiment. However, Earth-centric physics is wrong. It produces terrifically complicated equations for even simplified versions of predicting the orbit of a planet around a distant star. The speed of light is anisotropic. If you really get down to specifying things precisely it has to include rather a lot of kludgy compensations for variations in the Earth's rotation that are nevertheless perfectly definable. It isn't a useful way to approach physics. It is ""wrong"".<p>The previous paragraph isn't metaphorical. I am not saying ""it is theoretically possible to reformulate all of physics to be Earth centric"". I'm saying that one can in fact mechanically translate all physics equations into such a framework, and similar transforms occur all the time (although with better cause). I'm not just being rhetorical, though of course I am, it is also literally true. There is a set of equations that corresponds to the reference frame I am describing.<p>We select our representations of equations for two major reasons that I can see: One, to minimize the number of symbols necessary to express the concept. ""distance = velocity x time"" encodes a number of assumptions into it to shorten it, including a wrong idea about reference frames, but we still teach it because it's simpler than the relativistic version (and a hell of a lot simpler than the Earth-centric version!). Second, to enhance the human understanding of the situation being represented by the equation. That's not entirely separate, obviously, but they're not quite the same.<p>And I would argue tau wins on both fronts, and I for one plan on adopting it in my code. It's better.",1277748096

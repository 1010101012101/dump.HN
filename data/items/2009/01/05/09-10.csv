For 1 month, 1 year, 5 year, 10 year and 20 year intervals.<p>I break them up into categories: things, learning and financial.<p>I start off with ridiculous goals, things that seem unachievable, at the 20 year milestone and bring them closer to reality as the time interval shortens.<p>I write them down and display them in my home office where I can view them in plain sight each day. I have been incredibly fortunate in achieving almost everything I've written down at the 1 year interval for 3 years running.<p>I refine these goals every so often which helps me realign the mental image that I have of myself. I think if you can imagine it vividly and remind yourself of this image then you'll naturally move toward becoming it.",1231149427

They (the Council) don't just ""decide"" that from now on this is going to be legal. For it to be legal it has to become a law, and to become a law it has to pass through Parliament, a  highly unlikely scenario.",1231149289

I was 432, and wasn't nearly the fastest reader in there.<p>I'm on the other end of the spectrum -- originally grew up in a Punjabi-speaking household (immigrant family in The States), moved to English around the time of Kindergarten.<p>I think it's got to do with the innate redundancy in grammar.  You can focus on blocks of text and only get partial data from each, but reconstruct the entire thing in your mind in real time.  With practice, of course.",1231149249

420211,comment,419012,419821,0,0,zupatol,,,"It's true you can't argue someone out of being upset, because his emotions are distinct from his understanding of the situation. But if his anger is fueled by his view of the situation, changing his view will help him get his anger under control.<p>You are right there is an emotional bonus when the anger feels justified, and you are right to be skeptical when I say that in a fight one of the things I'm going for is to feel stupid for being upset. I'm probably harder to convince I'm wrong when I'm angry, but still I know it's then that I need it most. The best outcome is when the problem simply disappears because I realize it was only in my head. I'm not saying I'm capable of pulling this off everytime I should. In the fight I mentioned, my friend was actually pointing out that I blew the thing out of proportion, and didn't bother convincing me about the details.<p>I understand now that what you mean by losing a fight is admitting you were wrong. This is indeed embarassing, but it's also your victory over yourself.<p>Your idea of arranging to lose a fight sounds dangerous. I once did that with a coworker. I admitted I was wrong just to end an argument. When the coworker later found out I didn't really believe I had been wrong, there was no longer enough trust to solve the problem in a discussion.",1231149119
420210,comment,419703,419703,0,0,makecheck,,,"These rules actually favor being ""on time"", which to me is a terrible goal for a software project.  Those who think software can be ""on time"", tend to also consider the software ""done"".<p>In reality, any project can be ""on time"" and still fail miserably if it's hard to debug, hard to modify, hard to support, or implodes when the lead developer quits.<p>You don't want software that's ""on time"", you want customers who are well-informed so that their dependencies are more specific and flexible than a ""release date"".  You want them to be thinking long-term, so that they understand the true risks of insisting on early delivery (e.g. less testing, review and documentation may have been done, hence more bugs may appear in the future).",1231148969

I still think so.""<p>A guess why Goldwater was reviled? Voluntary Social Security would be DOA. It doesn't make fiscal sense for the upper class to pay social security, so they wouldn't.

Technical books are more or less obsolete, the only ones I can remember buying in all that time is the Samba administrators guide from O'Reilly (useless.) and Stuart Cheshire's Zeroconf book (delightfully written, I could read it for pleasure but no help at all in really getting to grips with Zeroconf from an implementer's point of view.)<p>I still have some classics which I refer to from time to time. The camel book in particular, since there exists no better reference to Perl's core APIs. However, for anything else the web is a far better reference library.",1231147593

420196,comment,419795,419992,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I'm not trying to brag -- just giving a data point which seems to suggest that the tagline ""nobody reads much faster than 400 words per minute"" is false.<p>I read the first article you linked to. I measured myself on it and got 630 wpm. (And I backtracked a couple times during the reading process. It's hard to focus when you know you're being measured)<p>I'm by 40-50% the fastest reader I know, except for my father (we're about equal; I've never measured much, just read over his shoulder). When other people read over my shoulder they rarely get farther than through the left page before I'm turning it; most of them only get through 2/3 of the left page.<p>In a line such as the following (from the first linked article):<p><pre><code>  several words. This is called a ""fixation,"" and it takes about .25 seconds on average. You\n</code></pre>\nMy eyes seem to fix in four or five spots (I can't tell for sure): ""several"", ""this"", ""and"", ""seconds"", and ""you"". So I think I can instantly read about 3 words at a time. When I stare at ""called"" I can read the whole phrase from 'this' to 'fixation' without moving my eyes. I get the sense that other people only read one word at a time. Is that true for you?<p>(Edit: In a monospace font like it appears here, I seem to fixate on every other word, so it's more like 8 fixations across the line. The tighter font on the original page seems to let me read faster.)<p>I was reading before I turned 2 years old, which is pretty young, I think. I am guessing this had something to do with how fast I read, although genetics may also be related.<p>Edit 2: I should point out that I've never tried to study speed reading or improve my reading rate. I did play around with Spreeder and I could read every word at 1200wpm, but my comprehension was in the toilet. I played around with setting it at 800 (with 4-5 words per screen) and it worked reasonably well, although I never fully got past the distracting element of it flashing lots of stuff in my face while I was trying to concentrate.",1231147057

I thought his observations on accountability were worth bearing in mind in 2009:<p>Legal OnRamp strives to simplify innovation and value delivery, primarily for in=house lawyers but also for law firms, both by providing tools to innovate and by sharing examples of success.<p>We have 7,000 members, probably 3,000 of whom have contributed content or otherwise added value. Perhaps 1,000 have contributed ideas on how to make our service better. Ninety nine percent of the good ideas and 99.9 percent of the work have come from someone other than me. More than 400 law firms and more than 700 companies are participating.<p>There are at least 100 things that need to go right; there are 200 things that could go wrong. When we started, 80 percent of lawyers thought we were nuts; 14 months later, 80 percent of lawyers think we're the future. I ""control,"" in a formal sense, very little of this.<p>Still, if Legal OnRamp fails, it's my fault.<p>There are no words we love to hear more than ""it's not your fault."" Whether from our mother, our friend, our cleric, or our consultant, when something goes wrong, we cherish absolution.<p>So let's be clear: if you are running a law firm and it fails, it's your fault.",1231146303

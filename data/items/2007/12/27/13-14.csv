92959,comment,92792,92958,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Read ""The Gathering Storm"" for an argument to topple Saddam made before we went in (but post 9-11) There is a long list of reasons which I won't go into here. 9-11 was the tipping point in terms of domestic politics, no doubt. It also seems to be the tipping point in terms of strategic policy.<p>\nThere's an interesting discussion about why democratic nations go to war. If there is a mixed number of reasons and a volunteer army, which are the actual reasons we fight? I just read read a blog entry by an Army 1st Lt. killed last year who made the argument that he was joining up to stop oppression. To do something and make a difference. I also hear a lot of folks talk about leaders with supposedly bad intentions who ""got us into this."" So when a president and congress vote on something, and people volunteer to do it, is it possible to assign any one reason to why it's being done?<p>\nPerhaps I'm splitting hairs. Probably get downmodded again for this comment. Have at it, then.",1198763004

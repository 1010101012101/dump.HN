580495,comment,580235,580235,0,0,apu,,,"At least in computer science, most of the major conferences are double-blind reviewed. This means that it's more difficult to figure out whose paper one is reviewing. This helps curb some of the abuses you seem to be worried about.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that academic papers are supposed to be about the truth, and so there is ostensibly an ""objective"" standard to which papers are held. Of course this varies a lot by quality of the conference, but the best conferences will generally do a fairly good job of letting the best papers in and keeping the bad papers out (most of the confusion/""unfairness"" comes at the borderline papers, where it is understandably more difficult to make a judgement).<p>That being said, I think some types of competition will always be a problem in any discipline, although it's not at all clear that the corporate world is at all better.",1240782948
580494,comment,579979,579979,0,0,spaghetti,,,"I've overcome procrastination by doing the following:  1)  Never make a long TODO list.  Having a long list makes choosing something on it overwhelming because you're simultaneously not choosing the other things.  Often the path of least resistance is to choose nothing from the list.  So keep short lists.  After all anything that's really important will get done whether it's on a list or not.  2)  When sitting down at your computer do a tiny bit of work first.  Do this before surfing the net, checking email, etc.  Often times this tiny bit of initial work will make doing more work easy.  3)  Simply don't surf the net on 50% of days.  Getting things done really comes down to choosing your project over, say, learning things by reading HN.",1240782917

These people had absolutely no qualifications to teach; however, the children produced from these schools were more equipped for the world of the time than any child today.

However, writing is what I've always wanted to do and when I first committed I knew I was not going to get paid for it for a long time. I believe it's been about 7 years now, and I finally know it's time to finish the job.<p>Right now, the reward for my current actions is likely to pay off in maybe 2-3 years. There's always the chance I could make a tasty advance, however this is highly unusual. The first book usually doesn't matter anyway, it won't be until my third that I get a true pay-off.<p>I believe you have to have incredible determination, planning skills (so you do feel somewhat rewarded, I do this by printing out a chapter as soon as it's complete to give to my wife to read). It's very hard to do, however it helps a lot that I find doing it incredibly enjoyable. When you wake up dreaming from a different world, it's quite an amazing feeling.<p>I also don't believe that sitting at a computer screen is work. My brother is an excellent programmer and from what I can perceive is that his processes are entirely the same as mine. In fact, I learnt a few tricks from him. Ideas and solutions usually appear when your mind is relaxed, simply piling on the pressure by stressing out isn't likely to help.<p>However, if you don't have the motivation to start a project, I wouldn't necessarily call it procrastination. It's quite possibly it could be atychiphobia (Fear of Failure), as not starting a project is entirely different from losing your way during it as the start of a project is usually immense fun, until the real work kicks in.<p>If anyone has a fear of failure, I don't believe I know how to help with that. I have no real fear of failure, I jump into everything from the deep end. I've lost a large number of projects along the way to attrition, all are failures but a failure teaches you and I have learnt a great deal. The first time I'd ever hit a golf ball was when I went out with my future father-in-law who had no clue I <i>didn't</i> play golf. I've found that sheer confidence can usually make up for nearly all lacking. So to anyone with a fear of  failure, I'd say <i>fail on purpose</i> because after that it can only get better.",1240782655

The two are inseparable and fuel each other. You already have a decent Unix in your Mac, and your FreeBSD is the best of the Unix breed bearing the original blood. For that there are no better companions than the books by Richard Stevens, both for system and network programming.<p>For larger scale software engineering you will need a few small to mid projects of your own. You will deal with header file and Make dependency problems, a few unix and processor portability problems and a few other stuff. The solution to those problems along with a fat library of useful routines are found in ""C Interfaces and Implementations"" by Hanson. It's a literate programming text where source code is interwoven with prose documentation and it's very self evident.<p>Along with productive C programming you might need to look into the darker side of C and Unix and follow the papers of the hacking underground (yes, HACKING, dispute the terminology all you want, but I think some blackhats deserve the noble noun more than javascript and CSS jockeys.) Unix and C have plenty of Not-TODOs to motivate plenty of caution. Hoglun and McGraw's Exploiting Software is the canonical C-Do-Not text books.<p>If you want to read library source code, your FreeBSD source code should give you plenty to keep you busy. Start with the sources for the games; I spent an enjoyable summer porting Minix games to DOS and taught me allot. There is also ""The Standard Function Library"", or SFL, google it, it has the cleanest C sources you ever seen. Highly recommended.<p>And should you ever want to write a C compiler, like I attempted, here is some advice: implement Oberon instead. Everything you could possibly learn at 1/100th of the headache.<p>Just the 2 cents of a guy who will only write C code again if there was a gun to his head ;-)",1240780652

Is this doable? Are there websites specific to finding telecommuting gigs? Say somebody loved testing software, writing scripts for it, and so forth, but just was not crazy about office b.s. like ""tps reports"" and so forth and wanted to kind of do the work from home on a consultant kind of basis. How might one go about that? Appreciate any thoughts you guys might have.",1240780072

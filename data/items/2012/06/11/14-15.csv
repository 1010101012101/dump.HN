But there were other reasons:<p>* a single large market which is competitive on a world-wide scale needs its currency<p>* less dependence on the dollar<p>* use it as a tool for further integration<p>* stabilize countries. This may look funny given what you read all day, but when the Euro was introduced many countries were either recovering from fascism (especially in souther europe) or communism. Having a large currency makes it much more difficult to speculate against these countries. The Hedge fonds are speculating against the Euro and they have a really hard time to bring it down - like they did with other countries.<p>But the Germans would not have agreed if it hadn't also brought direct advantages. The one big advantage is this: trading in the Eurozone is much much easier and cheaper with a single currency.",1339426735

Probably. They may have even encouraged it. Given the current (stupid) laws there is certainly a case to be made by the government. Still, the case is far from clearcut [1].<p>That being said, the remedy sought by and received by the government is disproportionate to the alleged offense.<p>One problem is that the DoJ injunction to both shutdown the service and maintain the data is costing Megaupload and/or the ISP $9000/day to keep 25PB of data around [2]. How much of that data was infringing exactly?<p>This is the part that leaves a bad taste in my mouth: the DoJ's remedy is essentially punitive to the parties involved (for what is still an alleged infringement) to the point that they simply want to bankrupt alleged offenders. Whatever happened to due process?<p>All of this leads me to two conclusions:<p>1. The Obama administration's track record on intellectual property is horrendous, from staffing the DoJ with RIAA/MPAA stooges [3] to secretly negotiating international treaties that treat copyright infringement with similar severity as counterfeiting or terrorism [4] (the original ACTA; not the one signed this year). This I think is so bad I think the administration needs to go (not that I think the alternative is much better); and<p>2.

The problem was not that the Deutsche Mark was high or low valued, it was more like the change was a problem. That made it difficult for companies to export. Large exporters were insuring themselves against currency value changes.<p>Basically a high valued currency made it cheap to import goods, energy and materials. A low valued currency makes these imports expensive. For example Germany imports most of its primary energy sources like oil. Devalue the currency makes the oil, gas and coal imports more expensive.<p>That the German industry depends or profits on a low-value currency is a myth. The Deutsche Mark was never low-value - just the opposite. Still exports were similar like they are today. The German exports will adapt.<p>The nice thing of the Euro is that the largest market for Germany is right around it and much of it is traded in Euros.

They are various ways for solving that.<p>Even a simpler approach: why hide those reviews. Keep them here and introduce a way for other viewer to rate the reviews aka 'X people found that review helpful'. That way all reviews are visible and the random person reading the Yelp page can decide for themselves.\nUnfortunately Yelp and their filtering system have a different approach and instead usually end up filtering real customer reviews and leave the more 'spammy' visible.

4094864,comment,4091199,4091199,6,0,quantgenius,,,"Based on the comments it seems many people are missing out on some of the most important points the blogger is making.<p>First, a very large percentage (maybe 40-50%) of Chinese companies going public on Western and developed Asian exchanges have turned out to be complete frauds.  There have of course been some very large companies that have been very successful and they are likely completely honest, but there are also many, many often smaller companies who's financial statements are pure fiction.<p>It turns out that the biggest beneficiaries of the frauds were politically connected families, yet none has been prosecuted.  The Chinese had decided to open things up a little bit, essentially taking baby steps towards the Western model and require companies to file at least a minimal amount of information domestically and to make some this information theoretically publicly available.  Furthermore when a company goes publicly in most markets outside China, it has to file a whole smorgasbord of financial information.<p>Most of these frauds were uncovered by a careful examination of financial statements companies going public were required to file.  A number of the frauds were in fact discovered by this blogger himself (see his earlier posts).  In many cases the financial statements were just ludicrously implausible.  In other cases they were listing facilities which did not exist etc.  Very few were in anything other than plain view.<p>Remember that this really hurts honest Chinese companies (and there are many high quality Chinese companies that do things by the book) because you are going to have to do far more due diligence on a Chinese company because you can't really rely on the financial statements.  Even after you do due diligence you are going to demand a discount.  While there is a mania for anything Chinese by naive retail investors everything seems fine if you are a small company with a limited float but for a huge company trying to raise a lot of capital, you have to raise money from well informed institutions.<p>While companies that only list domestically are harder to do due diligence on, it seems, based on work done by the blogger and others, that the percentage of frauds listing on the Shanghai exchange is at least as high as the percentage of frauds listing on foreign exchanges.<p>Imagine if 40-50% of US companies going public over a period of time were frauds and this was discovered through their public filings.  Legislators and regulators would be lining up to require more disclosure.  Instead the Chinese have now changed the law so Chinese companies have to file less information and the information they do file is practically a state secret.  This is somewhat akin to companies trading on the NYSE filing absolutely NO financial statements and the SEC and Congress preventing anyone from seeing what they did file.<p>Especially given that in the few cases where it is possible to trace the ultimate beneficiary of the frauds, it has been a politically connected family member, none of whom have been prosecuted, it is hard to ascribe any reason to pass rules restricting access to company financial information other than a desire by the elites to steal as much as they can through stock fraud.",1339426101

If they apply 20 hours of their time at home, that's not time that they'd get paid for anyway, so the analogy is as foolish as the claim that every pirated copy of a movie would have been bought were it not for pirates.<p>Instead, I'm choosing between 20 hours of reading a book and maybe 20 hours of watching television (for example), which costs the electricity that the television consumes (since the cable or internet is paid for already). I suspect you'll find 20 hours of TV will cost less than $29. Or maybe it's 20 hours of running over the course of a couple of weeks. That's free, except maybe for the cost of the water to rehydrate. That's probably cheaper than $29, too. If you want to do the analysis in terms of how much it will earn you in the future, that's also valid I guess.

Sometimes these were fun, sometimes not. (imagine a small room full of anxious people.. [execs, UI guys, engineers] getting a call from steve's admin saying he was on his way. 'oh, and he's just coming back from the dentist, not in a good mood') This day in particular started light, with Steve laughing/incredulous about this insult he was called or had heard ""fuckchop"", and wtf did that mean anyway. (this is the way back machine here, so it's fuzzy) I was up to show what would become iChatAV, very early days. That still didn't excuse a bad demo. We talked about a couple things, and then I went to my office to get the party started. A few seconds in to the demo, my mic went dead - I could hear/see them, they could see but not hear me. Trying to debug during a demo is a rook move, but I did it anyway. He got agitated, and said something to the effect of ""I think I've figured it out... <i>you're</i> a fuckchop!"". It was meant to be funny.. or at least that's I say when I cry myself to sleep at night.<p>What was I doing wrong?\nWell, plenty I'm sure! Anyone who had any dealings with Steve at any point eventually incurred his wrath. Just the way it was. You didn't get to that point however by being an idiot (or, 'fuckchop'). Steve always pushed the envelope, and that guaranteed you were going to fail at some point. That's good! If you don't fail, you're not trying hard enough. However, chalking up failure with a simple ""oh well""... that's bad! He wanted you to take failing seriously. Or maybe he was having a bad day. Either way, you got the business.",1339425077

My understanding is that most Germans that support the ruling party see inflation as something that is bad for them and erodes their savings and they link Euro-bonds and Euro QE with that. Bringing back a strong Mark that does not devalue would present a facade of non-inflation since there would be no QE for the Germans and no German-sponsored Euro-bonds but the new Mark would bring <i>actual</i> inflation because the Euro would immediately devalue.<p>As has been pointed out elsewhere the big problem is that the Germans pulling out of the common currency would be a step backwards in the political union objectives. If you believe that there is even a remote chance of a European war between major powers then this is a bad thing (I do not).<p>I think it is clear that the better solution is more political union in Europe instead of trying to drag the current arrangement through the crisis as-is.

After 4+ years of asking customers to write reviews of our service, our business has 63 5-star reviews and about 83 filtered reviews. We have a lot of happy customers and a lot of them create a Yelp account just to review us and then never use it again. I totally understand Yelp filtering these out.<p>Unless you're a restaurant or some other establishment frequented by the Yelping community, there's no silver bullet to getting a lot of great reviews. It takes time and probably more than half of the ones you get will be filtered.<p>That said, I think it's foolish of pretty much everyone to use Yelp ads.

4094604,comment,4094179,4094517,3,0,timtadh,,,"Spam filtering is hard? You are a programmer, imagine trying to find a way to objectively and fairly filter reviews. Unlike with emails you don't know whose labels to trust. There are good business owners who will only report spam reviews as spam. Then there are bad business owners who will report negative ham as spam to try and boost their reviews. Finally, there are bad business owners who will use shell accounts to submit positive spam and then mark it as ham.<p>In general the labels from business owners are not trust worthy which gets them into these situations. Thus they try and create other ways of identifying spam: like user engagement on the site. However, engagement doesn't always work as a metric as spammers can cultivate spam accounts by posting lots of ""legitimate"" reviews on unrelated businesses and then sell reviews from the accounts to attack (boost) specific businesses. Finally, users who have a tremendous experience at a business and go on Yelp to give them 5 star reviews may have no history with yelp except as a passive browser. The engagement metric will weight poorly for their review.<p>So what is to be done? I don't have a good answer for that. This seems more like a human problem than a technical one. The best course seems to be: act ethically, serve your customers with compassion, write responses offering assistance to negative reviewers, and if you feel Yelp (and similar review system are a bad idea) put your advertising dollars elsewhere.",1339423350

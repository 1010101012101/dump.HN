4110284,comment,4108400,4108879,4,0,drostie,,,"Look, there are two things you are saying. One is ""you can't do this with Ruby/Python"" -- which is a superiority-of-PHP argument -- and the other is a plea of ""PHP has done a lot, so let's not be too hasty dismissing it."" You made both of these arguments. In fact, you made the first one in this very comment where you say you're not arguing for PHP's superiority over other languages.<p>In some ways this is true but I would be hesitant. What you're really advertising is that PHP has an implicit `echo(""` statement which looks like `?>` and also implicitly occurs at the beginning of the file. A lot of new folks write really hard-to-follow code. Here is the seed of badness from which such code eventually germinates and blossoms:<p><pre><code>    <ul><?php\n    foreach ($users as $user) { \n        ?><li class=""user""><a href=""/users/<?php\n            echo $user['id'] . '"">' . $user['name']. '</a></li>';\n        ?><?php\n    }\n    echo '</ul>';\n</code></pre>\nIf you do not see why this is bad, imagine that you have a loop within a loop and they get separated by more than 20-30 lines of PHP. Notice how some of the HTML occurs within the PHP statement but pairs with tags outside of the PHP statement, and imagine functions which are producing such code. Et cetera.<p>Python+Flask will force you to either do it in a Jinja template, which avoids the problem because you cannot 'return back to Python' midway through:<p><pre><code>    <ul>{% for user in users %}\n        <li><a href=""/users/{{ user.id }}"">{{ user.name }}</a></li>\n    {% endfor %}</ul>\n</code></pre>\nOr else you could define the file within Python using strings, in which case your syntax highlighter will be able to tell you exactly where these strings begin and end:<p><pre><code>    output += """"""\n    <!-- ... more code ... -->\n        <ul>"""""" + """".join([""""""\n            <li><a href=""/users/%i"">%s</a></li>"""""" % (u['id'], u['name'])\n                for u in users]) + """"""\n        </ul>\n            '<li><a href=""/users/%i"">%s</a></li> % (u['id'], u['name']) \n            for u in users]) + """"""\n</code></pre>\nOf course, Jinja is more readable in this case, and that's kind of the point. For most web apps, you want a sort of preamble which calculates and formats a bunch of information, selects a template, and renders the template to the user. For PHP, this preamble is Apache, and if you want more, you probably need to generate an include() file to force yourself to stay sane. (PHP doesn't force this however, and many people write bad code which simply does the calculations in the HTML wherever they are needed -- and then you get massive code duplication and the joys of trying to match curly braces through large blocks of HTML.)",1339660068

In fact, people even think they are easier, AND they think their IDE does things that can't even be done otherwise! These people are smart enough to develop software, yet they are opting for what we think are dumb tools. Either we are just wrong, or there is just a misunderstanding about the relative easiness of IDEs.<p>I think that commercial platforms and products aimed at consumers (including developers) tend to have people paying careful attention to marketing and experience, to add a layer of glitz and wow and accessibility. It isn't that it could not be done but no one is bothering, once you know the efficient way then there is no point dressing it up.<p>I also think we have built up a culture which is somewhat punitive to newbies. Too many people treat programming and composition of command line tools as some kind of dick swinging competition rather than the inherently simplest and most straightforward way of doing things, which is SUPPOSED TO make your life easier and let you do things you couldn't otherwise do.",1339659963

There's no reason the software couldn't use the KDM to get the keys and decrypt a frame or 2 (or even a few seconds worth) of the (MXF) film footage as a test, regardless of the time. The encryption isn't numerically tied to clock-times--it's only enforced by the software (which now that I think about it may be enforced by legal contracts somewhere).<p>> One of those would be manna from heaven for any unsavory projectionist who wanted to make high quality copies from theater prints.<p>Not really. The keys and image decryption happen in a tamper-resistant ""FIPS can"" in the media server and then are re-encrypted and sent across a bus to the projector. Some newer projectors have the FIPS can directly inside so that there are no physically exposed interfaces with anything other than the full-blown AES encrypted frames. Having a KDM means you can play the movie but you can't ever actually get to the data.<p>Fun fact: before DCinema there used to be people who owned tele-cine scanners mounted in the back of flatbed trucks that would go around to theaters and pay unscrupulous employees to borrow the film for a couple hours. They'd have an very nice scan of the movie for pirate DVDs the day the movie came out.",1339658220

I actually got what I call a reading injury. 45 minute walk to work gets boring after a while, and after getting tinnitus (which when it was bad is /really/ bad) I was paranoid about listening to music or podcasts. So I read a book on my walk. Walking plus reading = bad for your neck. Took a couple of weeks of not read-walking to get my neck back to not hurting.<p>That's an extreme example though. However, even in simpler terms, your neck is not made to be held at an angle for extended times. When you curl up on the couch with a book, you'll usually have good support.

This is relevant to me because I know plenty of programming languages but I really haven't picked up Java or its predecessor C++ (technically I did make a basic android app essentially using what little I have learned of C).<p>Anyway its been a few months since I read that story and I have been digging around here and there (not too seriously) and have come across a few posts/blogs/ect affirming that it is possible and there is a tiny bit of documentation out there (for instance I found some python users out there using ""Jythonroid"")<p>Anyway the question is, is it really practical to program android in another language (yes I realize android utilizes XML in addition to Java) and if so which is the language(s) of choice?<p>Additionally, any bread crumbs that can be left leading to documentation would be very much appreciated.<p>Thank you.<p>Student<p>Daytona Beach, FL",1294912088

2099330,comment,2099297,2099297,0,0,antirez,,,"There are for sure strong cultural problems in Italy that are blocking innovation, but unfortunately it's not just a matter of getting money. Most of the time the real problem is in the founders. People usually don't like the idea of working very hard for something with a big amount of uncertainty about what the outcome will be, many are still very focused in getting a 'stable' position somewhere.<p>Another problem is that in general there is no trust in the idea that you can create business in the Internet. In part this is due to the fact that the online advertising market in Italy is smallish at best, that users are rarely willing to pay for services, and other stuff like that.<p>But... I think italians too often overlook what is good about Italy, and if there was not this cultural brake we could do much more interesting things. For instance there is a model where it is normal for a son to stay in the home of the parents up to 30 years old or more, without the need of earning at all. This means that you can use a few years to develop your startup without any required money.<p>Also in my opinion Italy is a place with many talents. It's not hard to find good people, there are many programmers as in the 80s home computing and electronic was a real boom here as an hobby, and schools are still in decent shape.<p>So what should Italian entrepreneur do? It's hard to focus on the italian internet market as it's small, but it is either not very easy to penetrate the US market from Italy. It's a very hard question. I would say that probably it makes sense to still beat on the US market for a technological company, but perhaps not just with finished products for the end user, but also with business to 
business technology, or electronics (things like Arduino).<p>Unfortunately some fields where we could be very successful require money that is hard to find, otherwise Italy could be

good design and technology. From alarm clocks to other kind
of appliances that are usually poorly designed and ugly to
see.<p>Well just a number of random ideas...",1294911581

But they need not be. This is the case in kin altruism. And this is also, why ""promoting longevity beyond the reproductive stage of one's life cycle"" affords sometimes very much such benefits. Example: grandparents can help raising their children's children (and their children's children's children ;)). Kin altruism becomes even more apparent in ants (or other social animals). Worker ants or bees are pretty much infertile but they help a lot.",1294910023

To back this up as a valid argument, it was pointed out that back when dial-up was king most providers (even those with only expensive per-minute access plans) had limits on how long you could be connected in one session and in total in a given day (this was to reduce the number of incoming lines and modem devices they needed to provide the service). So in this sense ""unlimited"" would be better termed ""always available"" or ""always on"".<p>Of course this isn't how they advertise the service, the adverts very distinctly imply (but are very careful never to actually state) that unlimited means bandwidth as they talk on end about downloading and streaming and show the happy people in ad-land watching HD content with reckless abandon.<p>A grey area still not tested to my knowledge is providers who have changed what the work unlimited means where it previously <i>did</i> explicitly mean unlimited bandwidth (when they were naive enough to think people would not find a use for enough to cause a problem).<p>One legal recourse t-mobile users may have in this case is if their plan previously explicitly stated a cap or fair-use policy higher than the 500MB. If you plan has gone from 3GB to 0.5MB then you probably have a case for demanding you keep the 3Gb until the end of the contracted period or to have your contract terminated early at no cost to you. Of course your original agreement may have weasel words like ""unlimited with fair use policy, _currently_ set as 3GB/month"", which would give them a get-out clause.",1294909292

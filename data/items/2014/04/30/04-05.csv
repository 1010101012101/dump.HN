7671683,comment,7668898,7671580,2,0,baddox,,,"> The thing is, tunesmith wasn&#x27;t talking about a perfectly tuned equal temperament guitar. We&#x27;re talking about tuning a guitar by ear so that one chord is sounds perfectly in tune (i.e., is in just temperament), then trying to play a different chord.<p>When I reread your comment, I realized that this is what you were talking about. In that case, you&#x27;re absolutely right. Although it is a pretty bad idea to tune a guitar by ear by playing a single chord. Not only will other chords sound out of tune, but even slightly different voicings of the same chord. A guitar that&#x27;s designed for equal temperament really needs to be tuned as such. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I think the standard ear tuning technique (where you match the 5th or 4th fret of one string with the open string under it) will give much better equal temperament results.",1398833754

It&#x27;s not clear to me that the car will always show estimated range to be 265 when charge is 100%.<p>Range estimation is a lot more complicated than &#x27;percent of max power stored&#x27; * 265. Obviously Tesla&#x27;s algorithm was too optimistic in this case, even though there seemed to be some &#x27;safety margin&#x27; at the start.<p>I&#x27;m sure Tesla has a great deal of data on the variance of miles covered on a full charge over all sorts of terrain, climate, traffic, driving patterns, etc. and I would assume they use that data to build a decent range predictor. Probably the hardest part is not so much getting a good prediction from given set of inputs, but actually getting decent inputs to feed into the predictor. Driver enters the destination address, but after that... is the car pulling temperature, wind speed/direction, elevation delta, statistical traffic patterns, live traffic, etc...<p>OK... After considering all that, maybe we just implement &#x27;percent of max power stored&#x27; * 265 and call it a day.

My point is that the world became much more weird than we would have given credit for a century ago or so ago, to the point that we still don&#x27;t fully understand it (even if we can use it to make predictions to a remarkable level of accuracy), after all, to cover it today, we have to manufacture new universes every time a person makes a decision to make the data fit (obviously, I&#x27;m reaching into hyperbole to make a point, but only because I put the person in the middle).<p>Could psi be an exhibition of some other weirdness, something in the realm of the indecipherable thing we call consciousness or some other effect we have yet to find? I think the odds are very long against it, but they are probably greater than zero. We live in a universe that may be a 3D hologram above a 2D reality; that leaves lots of room for things we don&#x27;t understand.

7671663,comment,7670441,7671181,2,0,vacri,,,"Cablecars are essentially a conveyor-belt form of transport. They require a lot of infrastructure and if there&#x27;s a breakage, the whole system is down rather than just one piece. They also make noise everywhere, even when there&#x27;s no traffic in sight.<p>Then, of course, if your conveyor belt is pedestrian-based, you have exposure to the elements (also meaning limited long-distance travel due to slow speed) and switching between conveyors would be troublesome (particularly if you&#x27;re inform or have baggage). If you instead ride in some sort of pod, you can up the speed and protect yourself from the elements, but you still need to get it on and off the conveyor belt smoothly; it&#x27;s be something approaching the complexity of a car anyway.

Closing the revolving door as much as possible, making it stronger.\nI have lived for many years in a country with an effectively missing FDA. It was there de-facto but it was a joke. So anyone could sell you anything. The joke about baby formula and chalk mixed with water was not a joke, it has happened. Other foodstuff is just like that.<p>Your argument is broken as well. There&#x27;s no way that the FDA can guarantee everything, because they would need 1000 times more inspectors if they wanted to do a reasonable job at it.  Currently as long as a site is visited ONCE by the FDA and considered safe, it won&#x27;t be years before that site is visited again by the same body. Everything that happens in between is basically completely out of the FDA loop, so anyway you have to trust in the products you buy.<p>Food traceability is a myth. You still don&#x27;t know, more than 50 years ago, what&#x27;s inside the products you buy, and whether these ingredients are consistent in concentration or not from one batch to another. You don&#x27;t know what your animals eat before they become meat in your supermarket. You don&#x27;t know what fertilizers were used to grow the crops you consume. You know virtually nothing about the food you buy, and guess what, the food has never been safer to consume than now, EVEN in countries where there&#x27;s no FDA - Don&#x27;t worry, Communist China also had issues with chemicals in the baby milk powder, except that people did NOT know or hear about it before. And China actually has a pretty strong FDA-like body and that does not prevent any of these issues from happening.<p>If tomorrow you got rid of the FDA, suddenly all manufacturers wouldn&#x27;t put poison in your food, as if they were just waiting for that.

The novel is part of the Future History saga, and takes place in 1976.

7671561,comment,7666575,7668271,3,0,gizmo686,,,"I&#x27;m reminded of the history of the measured charge of an electron. The first experiment to measure it was Millikan&#x27;s oil drop experiment, which got a value smaller than current measurements. As other scientists made their own measurements (with different experiments), the measured value slowly increased. What is interesting in this is that we would not expect to see a gradual increase in the observed value. The explanation for this is that when people find a value that was &quot;to high&quot; they would look harder for sources of error that would increase the value, causing a systemic bias to under-report the charge.<p>Similarly, with the faster than light neutrino, we spent far more effort looking for mistakes that would make our answer bigger than it should have been, which introduces the same systematic bias.<p>The solution to this is to realize that science is a time consuming process, and it is okay to take a while to arrive at the right answer. But, if we are aware of these problems, we can get there faster.",1398831031

No, it proves tetrodoxin is dangerous.<p>GMO labelling initiatives set out to inflame and spread fear, because no one ever wants to try and label exactly what has been altered, deleted or added.

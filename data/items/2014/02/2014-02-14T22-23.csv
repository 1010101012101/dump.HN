The little piece of ground yielded them a plentiful crop. Cunegund indeed was very ugly, but she became an excellent hand at pastrywork: Pacquette embroidered; the old woman had the care of the linen. There was none, down to Brother Giroflee, but did some service; he was a very good carpenter, and became an honest man. Pangloss used now and then to say to Candide:<p>&quot;There is a concatenation of all events in the best of possible worlds; for, in short, had you not been kicked out of a fine castle for the love of Miss Cunegund; had you not been put into the Inquisition; had you not traveled over America on foot; had you not run the Baron through the body; and had you not lost all your sheep, which you brought from the good country of El Dorado, you would not have been here to eat preserved citrons and pistachio nuts.&quot;<p>&quot;Excellently observed,&quot; answered Candide; &quot;but let us cultivate our garden.&quot;&#x27;",1392418784

7241639,comment,7234010,7237491,1,0,mpyne,,,"> Is there any evidence that humans ever weren&#x27;t large enough to worry about common property?<p>Well, yes, as long as you keep going back in the geological record (I won&#x27;t say historical record since written language would seem to have required a dense-enough population).<p>> If humans are social creatures, then it seems to me that this view of history can&#x27;t be right because humans have always formed governments as required by our social nature.<p>Well even at the family unit level you mention, there would be government (by head-of-household, whoever that was). In areas with multiple families you&#x27;d likely have common property which would need it&#x27;s own form of government (warlord, popular tribal chief, what-have-you). But that&#x27;s getting back to my original argument.<p>I think we might actually be in agreement; the key to me seems to be that the Hobbesian nightmare doesn&#x27;t occur when a populace and its government are organically grown. There&#x27;s no reason you&#x27;d see all-vs.-all in history simply because there was always some form of government.<p>Hobbes&#x27;s nightmare seems to come from the collapse of government among a mass of people, and its subsequent power vacuum, which results in subsequent in-fighting (or invasion from abroad). There are multiple examples of this in recorded history as well.<p>> But bandits have almost always been a reaction to the formation (often by distinct government policies) of a destitute class.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that destitution increases crime and violence against the weak. It&#x27;s easier to have morals when you don&#x27;t have to die of hunger due to your principles.<p>Likewise I think your point about blood feuds is spot on, but then we need to recognize that it has <i>become</i> government (as you say, law and order by a different means).<p>The idea that the &quot;war of all vs. all&quot; would be transient (until some form of stable governance sets up) is probably the thing which keeps Hobbes from being as much of a nightmare. But it also wouldn&#x27;t really make those who live through the transient feel any better about it.",1392418680
7241638,comment,7239407,7240953,5,0,aegiso,,,"> JS&#x27;s lack of strong typing limits your ability to reason about streams (a lot more than just streams, too) and further limits your ability to write performant stream computing software<p>I think you missed my point so I&#x27;ll restate: in practice you <i>don&#x27;t</i> reason about streams in Node, because the community (a product of the simplicity of the streams API) has a packaged solution to your problem. It plugs right in. And this ecosystem exists <i>because</i> of the simplicity and dynamicity of the constructs used.<p>I actually agree with you that Haskell does it &quot;better&quot;. It&#x27;s purer and cleaner. You&#x27;ll probably have less bugs if you write everything in Haskell.<p>Except it doesn&#x27;t matter to me, because Haskell doesn&#x27;t have anything close to the plug-and-playability of npm modules -- and this is a pure social product of the stupid interface that Node exposes compared to Haskell. Node is shittier, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more capable at solving the problem I have -- constructing powerful apps in close to no time, and zero lines of my own code.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that sometimes worse is better.",1392418664

Somewhere between 4 and 10 years you should be done floundering. :)<p>Sure you may need to check your API reference for specific function names and parameters, but there are very few aspects of my main languages that I don&#x27;t just know without having to look them up at this point.<p>And that experience translates even to languages you haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time learning.

7241634,comment,7240370,7240370,5,0,encoderer,,,"I think naming Trello is a dicey move. Trello is a great product. It&#x27;s incredibly simple -- a huge asset for most users -- and very well implemented.<p>I spent about 60 seconds looking at your homepage. I didn&#x27;t convert. Here&#x27;s my impression:<p>You say it&#x27;s like Trello. So I like that. And then I see a screen that is much more complicated. I glance at it. Then skip past. Ok, phases. Phaser. Ok. So it&#x27;s like, a way to keep tasks separate without just using a separate task board. Ok.<p>Moving on, now there&#x27;s &quot;arcs&quot;? I see what you did there, with &quot;story arc&quot; and all. But wait, now my super simple trello issues are grouped into phases and arcs? And if I use this as part of my bigger process, then my phases and arcs are split or spliced into my sprints. Also, there&#x27;s already an agile term for what you&#x27;re calling &quot;arcs&quot; -- epics.<p>But I don&#x27;t give up. I want to get it. I go back up to the top screenshot.  Ok, it&#x27;s 3 lists, just like Trello. But wait. Why is the first column green? And why is the top option bold? Do you select it? And then it changes what happens in the other 2 columns? But that&#x27;s not like trello at all. And it&#x27;s also not intuitive I don&#x27;t think. And one list is &quot;arcs&quot; but the other 2 are &quot;phases&quot;?<p>And what are the &quot;This week: 18...&quot;? Number of stories completed? created? Why do I need to see that on every single page?<p>Also, I skipped right over the Vim section. It seems pointless to me. That is solving a problem I do not have. But hey, I can see others may use it or it could even just be a bit of a gimmicky feature that does get it some attention.<p>Anyway, and more important than all that, congrats on shipping!",1392418636

He says he has gone through seven languages in the past 5-10 years.<p>School lays a deep foundation for programming.  I went back to school to get a CS Bachelors. I took a mathematics course that covered graph theory.  In the next class I learned data structures like trees, graphs etc.  Another class explained big O notation.  Then we learned various algorithms that could tackle things like the eight queens problem, sorting, or using Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm on a graph.  We saw how different sorting techniques and algorithms had different big O times.  We saw how data structures and algorithms interact.<p>All of this is programming, but all of it could be done with a minimal knowledge of a language such as Java.  Learning to program is about more then the learning the ins and outs of a language.<p>It seems a common misconception to people new to programming that knowing the syntax and keywords of a language is what programming is about.  Good CS programs give you an underlying intellectual framework of what you are doing.  Most people on their own do not have the discipline to study what is needed.  I spent hours studying the theory of computation and the Ackermann function and the halting function and so forth.  Most people on their own who have a choice between studying that hard theoretical stuff for months or working on their new game are going to work on their new game.<p>Also, you don&#x27;t know you don&#x27;t know.  For example, I had to come up with a hash function recently and was at a loss of what to do.  Then it struck me to use Gödel numbers, which I had learned about years before.  It worked well (although I barely made it into 32 bits).  I would have never thought of that without going to school.  Solutions occur to you that never would have without the education.",1392418017

As to, say, Python, I guess this is less of an issue, and writing a bit of Python just to see what happens probably has a beneficial effect on comprehension.<p>But, granted that point, I think reading and understanding the code of skilled programmers, before trying to write any significant code, is a very good idea.

Doesn&#x27;t it strike you that every &quot;brick wall&quot; the author ran into was a move from learning a language to using a massive framework? PDO, Backbone, and Rails were mentioned in the article.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this tendency from new programmers: to be a programmer, I must do what programmers do. And that means using &quot;real&quot; languages, &quot;real&quot; frameworks, work on &quot;real&quot; projects. <i>I think that&#x27;s wrong</i>, and I think we experienced programmers encourage that line of thought.<p>The author describes <i>enjoying</i> Ruby. He or she had <i>fun</i> going through a book on it, <i>fun</i> solving Project Euler problems with it, he or she <i>ran</i> home from work to play more with Ruby. I can&#x27;t imagine a better student. But after getting a basic familiarity with Ruby, the author tried learning Rails and was immediately overwhelmed: &quot;In the tutorial, Hartl introduces Ruby, Rails, Git, Heroku, Test Driven Development and just about everything else you can think of, right from the start.&quot;<p>If I had a moment to talk to the author <i>before</i> he or she began this programming journey, I would say something like,<p>&quot;To many people, programming is first and foremost fun. Yes, it&#x27;s a tool to solve problems, yes it can be a job and a career, but you already have a job. You don&#x27;t need programming to make you rich, or to have a stable career. So why don&#x27;t you instead focus on having fun?<p>&quot;As part of that, don&#x27;t think you need to learn all the tools of &#x27;real&#x27; programmers: you don&#x27;t need to make a beeline to Rails, or PDO, or Backbone. These are tools other programmers invented to solve their problems. You might not have their problems, and you might not like their solutions. After all, your goal isn&#x27;t to solve a problem for your boss by noon; your goal is to enjoy yourself and to learn something new. With time, you may find that you don&#x27;t need those frameworks and libraries. Or you&#x27;ll run into those same problems, and then you will truly appreciate those kind souls who made their solutions available to you, at no cost and with copious documentation. But don&#x27;t worry about that now. Focus on learning, on having fun, on challenging yourself bit by bit and then overcoming those challenges.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve met programmers whose attitude was, &quot;If you&#x27;re not using [framework], your code is worthless, and no progress can be made until you fix yourself.&quot; That might be helpful at a company where the goal often has a deadline, but to a beginner, especially one looking to learn for personal gratification, that&#x27;s not really a good option. Maybe your student is confused by all the magic happening in the framework. Maybe your student is a bit afraid of the tightrope of abstraction that they&#x27;re walking. Maybe you should slow down and figure out why your pet framework solves their problem.",1392417638

The problem Trello was trying to solve was that the traditional way of doing tickets (Trac/FogBugz/Jira) doesn&#x27;t give a manager a very good high level view of what everyone is working on at the moment and how projects are progressing. Trello was designed with that goal in mind and, frankly, does a pretty good job of it. It also works well for many other types of projects, because it is extremely flexible and unopinionated about how you do things, which was in mind as well, but was also somewhat incidental.<p>Source: I worked on Trello for six months before I left Fog Creek.",1392417413

7241504,comment,7240894,7241261,2,0,lutusp,,,"> What if one creates a multi-purpose class? How is that any better than a multi-purpose function?<p>Easily answered -- look at a class meant to deal with String objects. It encapsulates a string object plus any number of functions that deal with strings. Compare this to a function that does to a string what a class does, but necessarily under the command of a passed flag that instructs it which action to take. The latter is much less satisfactory from a comprehensibility standpoint.<p>I say this because I was programming before there were classes, or anything resembling high-level structure (I wrote Apple Writer in assembly language, a language utterly lacking in structure: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>), so I&#x27;ve watched a number of revolutions in programming over the decades. The idea of a class associating a data type and functions meant to deal with it seemed to me to solve any number of problems -- problems I had to deal with in various clunky ways before that development.<p>> I disagree there (that &quot;That&#x27;s a good argument in favor of OO programming&quot;).<p>But it is. The idea that all functions having any special meaning to (for example) strings would be enclosed within an object also containing the string to be operated on, greatly reduced the confusion that preceded it. One can make too much out of the OO paradigm, but the basic idea is sound and based on pragmatic thinking.",1392417182

I can remember trying to learn OO first in Perl and quitting before coming back to it from another language a year later.<p>Point is, programming is hard, but to me &quot;being a programmer&quot; means being a programmer as a job, where a) you have to solve problems for a living and b) you don&#x27;t get to quit.<p>Where I feel the author is screwing herself is the endless stream of tutorials, coupled with drinking from the firehose.  The language and the frameworks are two different problems that must be tackled, I think, in two different ways.  For example, when learning to code for iOS, it&#x27;s not Objective-C that gets you, it&#x27;s the new environment, frameworks and libraries.  However, you don&#x27;t get to quit and say, &quot;I could have done this in Wordpress.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m rambling.  Point?  Get a job as a programmer, paint yourself into that corner and stay there.

Eventually you move past the basics and get into more specialized, esoteric, and less generally-applicable bits, and it feels like it&#x27;s taking a lot more effort to learn much smaller and less widely applicable chunks of information.<p>This isn&#x27;t even taking into account the fact that the more you learn about something, the more aware you become of how much you don&#x27;t know. Two months in, you might feel less confident in your knowledge base than you did after the first month. It&#x27;s just the nature of the game.<p>I really got the sense reading this that the author assumed that the learning process would always be linear (the ratio of effort to returns wouldn&#x27;t decay as he got deeper into it), and that eventually he would reach an endpoint where he just knew everything and could build whatever he could imagine without continuing to struggle and flounder. It&#x27;s not like that though. You&#x27;re never done learning, you never reach a point where you can whip up nontrivial projects without at least a little bit of floundering, and you never reach a point where most real-world projects you take on don&#x27;t involve learning yet more new stuff or periods of floundering and frustration and false starts while you wrestle with how to design and implement it.<p>It sounds like he would get to this point of diminishing returns and assume that this must be happening because he wasn&#x27;t cut out to be a programmer, but really the problem was that he was assuming that things would get easier, not harder.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that he was so focused on web development as opposed to other types of programming- more than any other programming specialty, web development involves grab bags of seemingly random and unrelated technologies, some vastly overengineered, some comically underengineered, and none of which were really designed to be used together in the ways that people want to use them.",1392416469

What I am trying to do is show that the idea that a basic income can provide without distorting prices isn&#x27;t grounded in reality.<p>What is the bare minimum amount of money required for someone to survive?  And who defines what &quot;surviving&quot; is?  If you&#x27;re married with six kids (four currently of the right age for private school) your &quot;bare minimum&quot; might be $25k/mo.  No that&#x27;s not legit?  What is?  Does the &quot;bare minimum&quot; require that you get only a small 1 bedroom to yourself?  Or an efficiency?

My wife has gotten motivated to learn Ruby on Rails (having never been a programmer before), and it&#x27;s been a really valuable experience witnessing someone trying to understand almost all of the concepts from scratch.  Just trying to describe what git does is almost impossible without somehow comparing it to saving a word document.  The other day I had to clarify that typing something &quot;into Sublime&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s <i>only</i> in Sublime - that Sublime is actually a view (&quot;but I thought you said a view was a template!&quot;) into the same files and folders that are in her terminal.  And the thing about how you can push to both heroku and github, but not check out or clone from heroku, that&#x27;s still confusing.  But she was deliriously happy when she figured out how to add a scaffold and add a link to the &quot;create&quot; functionality from the header, all by herself.<p>When I look at the examples that the author pasted, it seems like the commonality is that they all go more than a couple layers deep.  Sometimes asking &quot;why&quot; twice is enough, but sometimes you have to go a few layers deep (like understanding PDO&#x27;s connection flags when all you want to do is get a user&#x27;s first name out of a database).  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s so much about ability or smartness, as it is patience, and what layer of thinking you&#x27;d rather hang out in.

I actually decided to learn Rust (<a href=""http://rust-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rust-lang.org</a>), which is a compiled language not unlike C. It&#x27;s relatively new (version 0.9).<p>The main reason I enjoy it is that it forces me to think about problems in a different way than I&#x27;m used to. Rust is a typed language (with some type inference going on), and it doesn&#x27;t really have arrays like PHP does, so it&#x27;s a real challenge to solve problems in it.<p>For instance, I&#x27;ve been going through Rosetta Code (<a href=""http://www.rosettacode.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rosettacode.org</a>) and trying to implement anything that sounds interesting in Rust. So far, I&#x27;ve done levenshtein (built into PHP), lzw compression, fibonacci sequence, MD5 hashing (built into PHP), quick sort, bubble sort, binary search, binary trees, etc. It&#x27;s a lot of reinventing the wheel, but it&#x27;s made me think about programming differently.<p>An example of a real-world result is that in my day job, I have an app that processes 10,000 items in 5 minutes. It takes that long for various reasons, but I decided to re-implement it in Rust. Using the exact same algorithm, Rust completed the task in 60 seconds -- that&#x27;s 5x faster! But while I was working on it in Rust, I realized that I was doing some things inefficiently, so I reworked the algorithm in Rust. Once I completed that, the entire task took 250ms (!!!). I decided to port that algorithm to PHP, and my new version completed 10,000 items in 1.4 seconds.<p>Going from 312s down to 1.4s is a huge deal, and while the new algorithm doesn&#x27;t solve all the edge cases that the old one does, it&#x27;s good enough that I can use it and compensate for the differences later. I can process those 10,000 items in 1.4s, and then spend 30 seconds handling the 300 that the algorithm didn&#x27;t catch.<p>Anyway, I digressed a bit, but I picked Rust, and I don&#x27;t regret it. I suspect I would have had similar successes had I used C or C++ or Java, too.",1392415440

In case you still have no idea what your program does, nor what its name is, you can still navigate to find your programs the old fashion way, using the dash and filters. I would assume that after using a program once or twice a user can either drag its icon to the side or simply remember its name. And if they do neither of those, the dash keeps a history of most frequently accessed programs. While using Unity I had 3 icons on the launcher and I _never_ even used them, and I run many apps at once.<p><i>Not being able to use the programs installed on my computer?</i><p>This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of Unity conflicting with a program and that might be a bug in one or the other.<p><i>But if you&#x27;re really using seriously, why pontificate about it.</i><p>Since many are pontificating <i>against</i> it, I think people deserve to be exposed to counter arguments. A lot of people have taken upon themselves to decide that Unity is this and that, without even using it properly. They spread fud as truth, instead of disclaiming it as their own opinion.

Doom and others use the free trial model, which is what we used to call shareware (before the internet, they wanted people to share the free trial with each other to inspire them to then go buy the full version).  As long as these are properly listed as such, there&#x27;s nothing sleazy about them at all.  And it&#x27;s fine to use an in-app purchase to go from trial to full version.  Again, as long as its clear to the user that this is the way it works.<p>Games that have in-app purchases run the spectrum.  Some use in-app purchases to do customizations and other fun things that don&#x27;t affect gameplay.  Then there are those like Dungeon Keeper which are basically unplayable without in-app purchases.  Watch the video I linked above for details on why.  You have to pay over and over and over just to keep the game playable.<p>This is very different from a shareware/free trial model.  You pay ONE TIME and you own the whole game.  It&#x27;s a classic commercial game scenario except they give you a taste of it... a trial... for free.  It&#x27;s the same thing with &#x27;lite&#x27; versions of commercial software that are also free.<p>The in-app purchasing model is more akin to getting a free version of an FTP client that only allowed you to upload software at 10KB/s.  You can then pay $0.99 to upload that one file at full speed.  But, your very next upload would again be 10KB/s unless you also paid $0.99 to upload that one at full speed.  But wait, for an even better value, you can buy a 20-pack of full-speed uploads for only $9.99 or a 100-pack of full-speed uploads for only $29.99.  Once those run out, of course, you&#x27;re back to 10KB/s.  Unless you spend even more money.<p>Now, it seems silly with the FTP client example above.  Who would ever use that software?

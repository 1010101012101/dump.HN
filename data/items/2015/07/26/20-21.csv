9952172,comment,9951762,9951762,0,0,ffn,,,"Lying about your progress and metrics is extremely rampant in the startup world of SV... but IMO SV&#x27;s biggest lie is that you need to be in SV and you need SV money to build a successful company. This flat out isn&#x27;t true, especially if you&#x27;re building a web service where your customers can be anywhere in the world and services / platforms that allow you to scale up incrementally exist. Most of what goes into building a startup is time-consuming trial-and-error grunt-work (e.g. reading documentation, editing boiler-plate code, answering emails / phone) that can be done much more cheaply and less stressful-ly from your mom&#x27;s basement than hemorrhaging $10k to $100k / month in a downtown SF office while the scaffold of a 4 month deadline looms ominously before you. (There&#x27;s a case to be made for the value of mentorship, but that value is always multiplicative and never additive - as in, if you don&#x27;t have a business, your value of 0 is still 0 after multiplying it by the value of your mentor. So for mentors, the later the better.)<p>SV&#x27;s second biggest lie is that you need the so-called &quot;hockey-stick&quot; growth curve to be competitive in order to be successful. This lie is clever because you&#x27;re so caught on hockey-stick that you forget to question the premise of competitive. In the beginning of founding your startup, knowing about your competition might help you build your own product, but worrying about your competition is worthless because the world is more than big enough for the both of you (especially considering you don&#x27;t exist yet). And if you don&#x27;t have overhead (i.e. you didn&#x27;t take SV money and hire a ton of SV&#x27;s cleverest and most paid engineers), the world will always be biggest enough for you to survive.<p>SV&#x27;s third biggest lie is coffee can replace sleep. That&#x27;s not true, and one of your organs (usually your liver, but I&#x27;ve heard stories of kidneys, lymph nodes, beards, and even ovaries) will let you know after a bit.",1437944155
9952171,comment,9951854,9951854,0,0,dangrossman,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s unfair, and you will have to make peace with that. All businesses suffer losses from factors beyond their control. It&#x27;s an expense/cogs line item just like your hosting bill. Be glad you don&#x27;t share the plight of retail stores: not only do they get credit card chargebacks too, and are vulnerable to types of payment fraud you&#x27;re not, but 1 in 11 people walking around have shoplifted at least once. 1.5% or more of the average retailer&#x27;s inventory will simply vanish as shrinkage to theft, damage or lost items each year.<p>In your specific scenario, you likely didn&#x27;t have the evidence needed to rebut those chargebacks. The only time you can rebut reason code 41 (cancelled recurring transaction) is if you have evidence the customer &quot;did not cancel the transaction&quot;. A customer sending you nothing (i.e. subscribed, paid a few months, never requested cancellation) means you have no such evidence that they did <i>not</i> cancel those specific renewals. The customer, on the other hand, &quot;does not have to supply evidence that you received a cancellation notice&quot;.<p>If these are losses you can work into your margins, then just walk away from these chargebacks. Unless these transactions are thousands of dollars each, it&#x27;s probably not worth the time and energy pursuing the unpaid bills instead of operating the business.",1437944140

They arguably reduced the value of their disc subscriptions by 16-17% without altering the monthly fee.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising it&#x27;s still profitable, based on some back of the envelope math, they&#x27;re number of subscribers is only 26% (20 million to 5.3 million) of their high but their employee headcount is 17% of its high (50 hubs x 100 employees vs. 33 hubs x 25 employees). Not accounted for is how many of those subscribers has, like me, opted for a cheaper plan (e.g. 2 at a time from 3 at a time). My hunch is the costs of adding discs (and replacing damaged ones) have gone down (fewer subscribers need fewer discs plus disc costs have remained steady or even gone down) while adding streaming titles has probably gone up as there are more competitors including ones who will pay for exclusives.<p>I hope it survives pretty much as-is, at least until the total streaming market can compete in terms of catalog size. 93,000 DVD titles is about an order of magnitude greater than any one streaming service&#x27;s catalog and most of what&#x27;s in one streaming catalog is available in another.",1437943910

However, during emergencies, the nature of the emergencies overrides the risk of compromise when accessing those commands, which typically are just specific scripts run from a locked down account.<p>Thus the security of the system depends on my ability to keep emergency credentials compartmentalized when using a different set, so that way only a single set of emergency commands are available to an attacker at a time -- and only when they&#x27;re commands related to an already failed system.<p>Thus the security of the system is best preserved by strategies which highly compartmentalize the credentials, since they&#x27;re meant to be used on potentially unsafe systems only during emergencies.<p>I guess I just remember 3-4 passwords like it&#x27;s my job to -- because it is.",1437943681

9952140,comment,9949818,9952048,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I didn&#x27;t mean it as a cutdown on him: more a reminder to do what he does professionally. Security evaluators and hackers alike often get into networks with attacks on gateways and firewalls setup poorly. It&#x27;s on everyone&#x27;s checklist. A Netgear router works similarly, albeit less features, so I tried to get him to make the mental connection between a weakness he&#x27;d readily recognize in one area and one that applies in another area. I could see how it might come off differently though...<p>Far as my post, it&#x27;s part of my larger theme that people aren&#x27;t apply what the field learns. You don&#x27;t need to be Paul Karger or Dan Bernstein to do better than what we see. The safety critical industry responded to C&#x27;s problems by subsets, reviews, static analysis tools, and dynamic testing systems. Quality went way up. We&#x27;ve seen the same in academia with free prototypes of many and further work to straight-up knock out the issues (Ur/Web & Softbound are recents). No uptake. There were system languages such as Ada that, by default, eliminated many of the common problems. Little to no uptake. There were concerns about a steady stream of compiler problems. They could improve/use the model with constant problems or the one (CompCert + ML implementation) with the solution. No uptake. Safety- and security-critical work showed microkernels greatly improved security by eliminating much kernel code, isolating others behind mediated interfaces, and allowing recovery in simple failure modes (eg drivers). Most ignored it and Linus deplored it but at least GenodeOS took it up with an active community. Rare exception.<p>There&#x27;s a recurring pattern in INFOSEC where proven solutions to problems are either forgotten or ignored. I fight that trend in my posts where I identify known issues or promote alternatives (design or implementation) that were previously field-proven. I also give credit to those that make solid attempts to do it better often with results: qmail, GenodeOS, Minix 3, INTEGRITY RTOS, Secure64&#x27;s SourceT OS for DNS systems, Sentinel&#x27;s HYDRA PCI firewall, CheriBSD, Cornell&#x27;s SWIFT, Praxis&#x27;s Correct by Construction w/ SPARK Ada, Python with Cleanroom methodology, and so on.<p>There&#x27;s lots of amateurs and pro&#x27;s alike doing stronger methods in academia and commercial sector. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a full EAL7 system or even that formal. Yet, if a tool exists that immunizes against big problems, why aren&#x27;t we using or breaking/improving it? Why do I see another presentation at DEFCON breaking a vanilla bug or a new tech that delivers a tiny fraction of that protection? Why are security-critical apps not leveraging free tech to improve them and decomposition/least-privilege at the least?<p>I&#x27;m not asking much. Just using what exists, what&#x27;s shown to deliver most bang for buck, what&#x27;s free, and what takes only a small portion of the labor. Do that from language to architecture to protocols. Baseline will be so much better. I noted in both comments I was grateful to the fragment of INFOSEC that does this. Yet, most of the field just reinforces the status quo while occasionally calling out or bandaiding the preventable problems it introduces. Many get a rush out of these attacks they create they don&#x27;t get out of building tools that create immunity to attack classes. Hence, that other m-word as a metaphor for what they&#x27;re doing. In the end, nothing changes with that approach but at least they&#x27;re having fun. ;)",1437943316

Maybe you do, I don&#x27;t know. But I think you should at least think about instead of falling back on the idea that the web is Javascript-driven.<p>You (probably) won&#x27;t be benefiting the people without Javascript because <i>hopefully</i> your page works for them anyway. (Astoundingly, some simple article-type pages do not.) You will be benefiting yourself and almost all users because, without JS, your site will load faster and (often as not on really JS-heavy websites) scroll faster.<p>If you&#x27;re creating a webapp, sure, you&#x27;d be crazy not to use Javascript.<p>But it&#x27;s insane that Internet comment threads or text-based articles can drive yy i7 to 100% usage.",1437943012

It is too big, there is too much to do and learn in any reasonable amount of time. You(not you specifically) need to set some specific goals and etch away at them everyday.

The first had too much of a performance hit or required different hardware. The second wasn&#x27;t good enough because, like you said, a whole umbrella of attacks existed that achieved same goal. Eventually, this paper [1] coined &quot;Control Flow Integrity&quot; as the property of protecting control flow rather than all memory issues. It cites lots of other work that specifically tries to protect control flow. The general idea seems to be that stopping code injection is highest priority and methods that focus just on that might have less performance hit than full memory safety. Plus, if you focus on preserving a property in all situations, then the individual ways to exploit a lack of that property no longer matter. Unless they&#x27;re things that destroy your whole model. ;)<p>At least, that&#x27;s the impression I received from reading most of the papers. A few were clever enough to use segments like the old high assurance A1 systems did. CPI enforces a similar property on pointers with an interesting design and segments in its strongest form. Resulting performance penalty is negligible despite a large number of attacks stopped by it. This field is rife with failures so it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if more issues are found. Yet, combined with the bug bounty, the weaker SFI model used in Chrome has worked well enough. The stronger, CPI might deliver after enough analysis and fixes.<p>Note: While looking that up, I found a recent CFI scheme [2] by Criswell et al that builds on their SVA-OS scheme. It supports my assertion about why CFI exists with this claim:<p>&quot;Where comparable  numbers  are  available,  the overheads  of  KCoFI are far lower than heavyweight memory-safety techniques.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64250/ccs05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64250/ccs05.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sva.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/KCoFI-Oakland-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sva.cs.illinois.edu/pubs/KCoFI-Oakland-2014.pdf</a>",1437941665

I especially endorsed the segment method as it was less likely to have an easy bypass. I posted it on Schneier&#x27;s blog and elsewhere as an example of good research that tries to solve a root problem (i.e. enforcing invariant) rather than tactically countering every manifestation of it. I&#x27;d like to see more review of and enhancements to it by the types of people that broke prior, SFI schemes.<p>Remember that this method can be combined with other techniques to reduce overall risk. For instance, this combined with interface protection for input and a separation kernel approach for small TCB would give the attackers less to work with. Critical algorithms on data pointers might be proven with Astree. And so on.",1437940942

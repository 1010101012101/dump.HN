In general, taxpayers in rich states get back less than they pay in federal taxes, and the beneficiaries are poorer states, who get back more than they pay.<p>It's a good setup, because prosperity in one area can help the whole country, and it lessons the infighting among the states. A rising tide lifts all boats if you will. If one state suddenly goes from 'poor' to 'rich' (like Texas when oil became a big deal) then other states will automatically benefit.",1211212187

Other sites may do it to increase reliability and with no intention of the route becoming public.<p>10 years ago, there were a few parties offering your own TLD for US$500 per year or more. (This is trivial to configure within BIND.) Unfortunately, it only worked if you used specific name servers. For a site wanting its own intranet TLD, it would be trivial to configure if they used the default name server addresses and therefore any change of root server address could cause any number of sites to inadvertently broadcast routes.<p>Highlighting these ""rogue"" servers could be a ploy to discourage the use of autonomous root servers. ICANN is keen to note that any fragmentation of DNS threatens the stability of teh iNterweb, or somesuch tosh.

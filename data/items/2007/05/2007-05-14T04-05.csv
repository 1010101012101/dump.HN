And you failed to demonstrate why the US is less free than Europe. <p>""We can then talk about why I pay almost identical income taxes in the USA and in Spain""<p>USA: top income tax rate and the top corporate tax rate are 35 percent.<p>Spain: top income tax rate is 45 percent, and the top corporate tax rate is 35 percent.<p>Now for the jugular (from heritage.org)!<p>USA: Unemployment: 5.5%, $39,676 per capita<p>Spain: Unemployment: 11%, GDP per capita $25,047<p>It would seem that Americans are almost twice as wealthy as Spaniards, pay less income tax, and have more than half the unemployment.

6151186,comment,6141170,6147642,1,0,derefr,,,"I think I agree with you, actually.<p>I was making the point on principle: there are quite a few Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business If You Do-type laws[1] on the books, which indeed protect people from scammers that don&#x27;t have their best interests at heart; but where, if you <i>do</i> have people&#x27;s best interests at heart (and know what you&#x27;re doing enough to not, say, use unsterilized bottles), the laws are actually giving consumers a suboptimal result, and people will be grateful for the things you can do for them by skirting them.<p>For an example of what I <i>do</i> think is a valid &quot;hustle&quot;, say you&#x27;re holding an event and selling tickets. You have the idea of getting your friend--who owns a nicely pimped-out bus, and who <i>has</i> a commercial driver&#x27;s license (so you know they <i>can</i> drive that thing safely)--to come around and pick people up and take them to the event as a free service. You&#x27;re probably still breaking all sorts of little laws there--taxi or limo laws, certainly--but the customers who take you up on that service are getting a better experience than if they had to arrange transportation separately.<p>This, on the other hand, is closer to the line. I think, if they had been doing anything &quot;food-processing-y&quot; to the vodka, like adding a flavorant or something, I&#x27;d be less okay with it; as it was, though, they just did a bottle-filling and a labeling, which anyone with experience in home kit-wine/kit-beer making knows how to do safely. I would say that, in my own mind, at least, it&#x27;s similar to buying bulk-ketchup at Costco and then printing up ketchup packets with your brand-logo on them and giving them away at your restaurant.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain&#x27;t_Nobody&#x27;s_Business_If_You_Do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain&#x27;t_Nobody&#x27;s_Business_If_You_...</a>",1375505926

Complex code usually contains some horrible callback spaghetti, which is not pleasant to debug at all.<p>2. General flakiness, or, as I call it, the &quot;WTF happened?&quot; syndrome. I run into this all the time. Change or add something - suddenly you find the web page broken. Okay, so there&#x27;s a bug somewhere. Click developer tools - console... blank. No error messages, nothing. Just you and the broken web page. Just the other day I was trying to integrate a select2 input field into some angular.js-powered page and ran into all kinds of weird issues. But why does it even have to be a problem? Why can&#x27;t I just stick a new control into a web page with a click and maybe a few lines of code? Hey, remember those things called &quot;Visual Basic&quot; and &quot;Delphi&quot;? UI programming with these was a blast, all the controls looked and behaved the same across all applications. And then there was ActiveX. The idea behind ActiveX is almost <i>futuristic</i> compared to the shit we have to put up with.<p>3. Type system. Made a typo in a variable name? Bad luck, Javascript will introduce a new variable and you&#x27;ll have fun chasing a non-existing bug. Oh, look, here&#x27;s a function: &quot;function foo(param)&quot;. I wonder what does it do? Unfortunately, the previous maintainer has not left much comments, so now I have to dig through the implementation to find out what the parameter should be and what values the function may return.<p>These are my main issues with javascript. I hope sometime in the future we&#x27;ll throw out the whole Javascript/HTML thing and start writing web application front-ends in a language that  is more geared towards UI programming. I can imagine having a nice declarative language (instead of HTML) to describe what the interface looks like, and a statically typed imperative scripting language to describe UI behavior. It would also be awesome if these technologies allow for painless integration of independent UI components (a bit like ActiveX controls). But those are just dreams...",1375504640

It&#x27;s a startling <i>effect</i>, but once you know the theory (that bubbles at neutral pressure in a medium settle into a low-energy state of being perfect spheres; and that collapsing a perfect sphere of material inward causes fusion), it&#x27;s pretty easy to make a device using ordinary <i>high-level</i> physics that can achieve the effect. In fact, it&#x27;s so easy that evolution came up with a way to let shrimp make these perfectly-spherical bubbles just by banging their claws together, so as to use the resultant fusion reaction as a stunner weapon.<p>I have a hard time reconciling the idea that <i>we</i> just keep learning about the existence of things like that as we keep throwing Basic Science research at the problem, with the idea that an AI of the <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/</a> variety wouldn&#x27;t be able to figure out one or two that would let it use the (predictable!) effects of its computation on its own computational substrate to manipulate its environment--at least with the sloppy way we design computational substrates <i>now</i>, where we don&#x27;t take such things into effect.<p>Here&#x27;s an analogy: say we made a self-improving AI with a <i>biological</i> substrate--in the shape of a human being, say--and then locked it in a cage in a straitjacket. The &quot;self-improving&quot; part would imply only that it could change the organization of its own synapses within its head. Yet, still, don&#x27;t you think it could organize those synapses into a shape so as to manipulate the chemicals and proteins that pass through the brain? It&#x27;d be pretty simple, if I could re-organize <i>my</i> brain, to stimulate the growth of misfolded proteins ala a Prion disease--but an AI could target <i>specific</i> misfoldings--or rather, chosen new foldings--and then build up new biological structures from the new proteins. All it would need at that point, in this scenario, is to create something roughly like a &quot;spore&quot;--a container filled with a retrovirus containing its own DNA, to infect another host, or perhaps a seed that could land and grow on its own--and get it out of its body and airborne.<p>Computers, as they are now, are no <i>less</i> leaky than that. Probably moreso, given that they haven&#x27;t &quot;evolved&quot; for millions of years under an environment where external agents are constantly trying to exploit them. (Anti-virus programs would not know what to do with even the technological equivalent of a simple virus like HIV, let alone something where each cell-actor is individually intelligent.)<p>We <i>could</i> probably build a &quot;safe box&quot; -- an enclosure electromagnetically, gravitationally, thermally, and whatever other -ly sealed from the outside envrionment; stick a computer in that box with an architecture that is designed to unavoidably <i>self-destruct</i> in two ways, one representing a 0 bit and one representing a 1, and with no way of encoding further information in the configuration of the debris; and then put an AI on that machine, set to start up after the &quot;seal&quot; is activated with a question for it already in place, and only &quot;unseal&quot; the enclosure after the destruction of the machine is already complete. (If the AI figures out a way to turn off the computer&#x27;s self-destruct, we just never unseal the enclosure; the enclosure would necessarily have to failsafe to a sealed state, rather than requiring active reinforcement.) Then, <i>maybe</i>, it would be safe to run the self-improving AI in the box. But I wouldn&#x27;t be sure.<p>Of course, this is assuming we aren&#x27;t ourselves running in a Simulation with exploitable low-level rules, and that the AI wouldn&#x27;t just rather &quot;escape the box&quot; by escaping the <i>universe</i>. ;)",1375502964

The only way to get back to the more efficient model is to make a drastic hard-break and abandon a lot of current work.

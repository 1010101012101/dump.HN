I hope so.<p>So I'm not surprised that many people don't believe in those things, and scientists too. It's for a good reason.

He noticed that Moscow-Pyongyang routes were hypothetically opened.  He secured a travel visa through the normal routes, and as it turned out, his visa was valid for any entrance to N. Korea.<p>As a result, he entered the DPRK through the Russian border. He was able to walk around in normal N. Korean train stations and talk to the locals, without any government guides or monitors.",1248628087

This tactic isn't new -- remember Adlai Stevenson? Notice that the issues where public and scientific opinion diverge the most are the most politicized ones? It doesn't just happen in America; this is the effect of politicians and religious leaders targeting mindshare while scientists simply can't make that the priority. We eggheads don't stand a chance unless our research lines up with someone else's goals.",1248628041

And we see this everywhere, no matter what the political system.<p>Some of the stats on wealth creation are interesting. If I remember correctly, it's very unusual for children of rich people to also generate a lot of wealth on their own. That's why you see one rich guy trying his best to keep his kids from squandering everything. If you're lucky you send them to a lot of schooling and they do acceptably well.<p>It's the hustlers that make the money, no matter the system.<p>I don't think you can have ""fair"" -- it's an overloaded term and can be stretched to fit anything. What you can have is enough controlled chaos and change that patterns are not easy to spot and exploit.<p>I'm not familiar with the term ""Bush dynasty"". Do you mean the fact that a bunch of them are in politics? If so, you'd have to add the Gores, the Kennedys. and a lot more to that category. I'm concerned that we're creating a system of nobility here with all of the offices that effectively have no competition and all of the families that hand down political power, but that seems a little off-topic for this thread.<p>I wouldn't say China is unfair because children of bosses get the goodies. I would say China is unstable because the same bosses rule for generations and the same kids get the same handouts. We see this pattern in a lot of places, but China has it the worst.<p>It's just the type of thing that Chinese communism was supposed to <i>stop</i> from having, so if anything you'd think they would be sensitive to this.",1248627908

It seems like Microsoft is pushing a value-add with their products. Of course, it serves their agenda, but everything every company does serves their agenda -- that's why they're companies. I don't see the difference between Microsoft bundling IE with Windows and Apple offering a free iPod with new Macs during ""Back to School."" And yet, no one ever suggests that maybe Apple should be offering a choice between a free iPod and a free Zune.<p>Not only that, but I'm also troubled by the inclusion of other browsers. Why should Firefox get the free publicity? Because they're popular? Well that seems to be the same argument against IE. Personally, my favorite Windows browser is Opera, but how much do you want to bet that that certainly won't be on their list.",1248627685

With that, you have private organizations lobbying the government to increase their bottom lines, and politicians get to look tough on crime as a nice bonus.<p>The part that scares me the most is that is may be impossible to live in the US without breaking some law.

I do think that the technology that has popped up over the last few decades allows for means of organization and collaboration for providing life necessities that were not available for the vast majority of human history.<p>If I'm being idealistic, I think that a good bit of the historically useful functions of government ( on a more abstract level, historically useful functions of centralized authority )is made quite outdated by the availability of global communications and exchange to the ""common man"". It's a can of worms of a topic, and I don't really have the time to get into it right now, so I'll leave it at that.<p>If I'm being extremely idealistic, I think we should be in a state of post-scarcity in terms of shelter and food, and I think that the internet is a large part of the way that humanity will get to that point if it ever does. In the same vein, I lean towards thinking that getting to that state will become rather <i>necessary</i> for the continued growth and survival of our species, if we're going to continue to grow and survive.<p>But yeah, can o' worms.",1279918691

Even with all the tools that they have, the chance of simple misunderstanding and ""No-no, that's not what I meant!"" is always there. That's why I think there should always be a user acceptance stage, where users get to play around with the release (ideally, with data as close to production one as possible), and 'ok' the release for production from there.<p>Also they didn't mention QA at all.

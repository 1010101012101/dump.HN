While pen and paper is an easier attack for a single voting station, it is far more difficult to scale.  Every voting place brought in on the scheme has more people who could be caught or decide to go public, and that is assuming you are able to get in contact with those people in time to ensure they are able to intercept the voting.  With voting machines, one good exploit, especially for wifi enabled machines, can easily infect larger numbers.<p>As to why other countries don&#x27;t have people viewing it this same way...

It also seems obvious to me on the face of it that those differences impact in practical terms what is logistically effective.<p>Some differences I know of off the top of my head:<p>America is a relatively young country for a world power. It is much, much younger than many European, Asian and Middle Eastern countries.<p>There is much lower population density in the US than in many other developed countries. It is also huge compared to many other countries. The combibation of low population density and lots of land means, no, you can&#x27;t just let someone go and then hunt them down later as the OP suggested. They absolutely can disappear on you and can then potentially go to another state or even another country, such as Mexico or Canada.<p>Unlike Europe or Japan, large parts of America still have large, very dangerous wild animals like bears and moose. Foreigners often decry America as some land of savages for our right to bear arms, something you cannot legally do in some countries, and our propensity for exercising that right. I don&#x27;t own a gun and never have, but I assure you that if I moved to Alaska I sure as hell would acquire a shotgun and I would store it the way my father stored his shotguns: unloaded but not locked up, with ammo readily available. If a bear gets into your house, you do not have time to unlock a gun case.<p>Given that we do have a right to bear arms, the police absolutely are dealing with a more dangerous situation here than the police deal with in some countries. That increased danger makes their job riskier and it means failure to contain a threat can have terrible consequences.<p>I am sure there are a great many other differences, but those seem to be a few very salient ones. If you want a longer list, I imagine you can readily find more with a quick google.",1439916213

A friend of mine (the author of TinyMush) and I were certainly thinking about it at the time (I had embedded OS design experience, but none with virtual memory so maybe we would not have pulled it off).  Also don&#x27;t forget that the enabling technology was gcc and there was the example of Minix.<p>We did contribute to the floppy driver.  The original driver read a block at a time before incurring a rotational latency.  I had had enough of this slowness with SCO Xenix, so added a track buffer to speed it up on Linux.  My friend wrote the original generic SCSI driver, to support a film scanner.<p>I think we may have made one of the earliest products using Linux.  We worked for an entrepreneur who started a business selling medical image archiving and teleradiography equipment.  In those days, ct-scan machines and MRI machines had no networking.  To get images from them you had to capture the image sent to the console screen or use the 3M laser camera parallel interface.  (My job was to make cards for this capturing).  Image transfer was over phone lines using sz/rz and Telebit Trailblazer modems.<p>Anyway, at some point one machine did have network (I think it was some proprietary interface, not DICOM).  The problem was that Linux did not yet have a networking stack.  The solution? Use &quot;KA9Q&quot;, the amateur radio TCP/IP stack in userspace for this.<p>At some point Pat Volkerding (Slackware) also worked with us.  I remember he was a big deadhead at the time, wrote Slackware while living in parent&#x27;s basement.  We were half installing / half developing a teleradiography system after hours in Eastern Long Island Hospital.",1439915559

This is the kind of scenario I am talking about.  Managers don&#x27;t typically sit and watch everyone work, nor do they discuss time reporting entries individually, so all they end up seeing is the data.

A better way of looking at this would probably be systems biology. Machines started as the corollary of a specialist lifeform. More and more they are evolving into a generalist lifeform. As they become more generalist they will directly compete with a larger population of the humans. This will push more people into specialist roles in society. Any specialist lifeform runs the risk of extinction if the environment it depends on is significantly altered or disappears.<p>The strange thing is that is well understood in biology, but for some reason when we apply it to people we think it doesn&#x27;t work that way. Most people are limited in their ability to significantly retask.

The goal is to stop malware from hooking Win32 to steal user information or otherwise perform exploits which might raise their access level (e.g. out of a sandbox). If Microsoft wanted to avoid breaking this DRM they would literally have to make their stuff less secure and ignore modern technologies which are designed to prevent/make it harder to do exactly this.<p>Not only has Microsoft made the right decision, but it was really the only decision they could make. They cannot just ignore new security technology because some DRM was written to exploit Windows back two versions ago. It sucks that users get caught in the middle, but DRM always kind of did that by its nature (legit users get caught between the publisher and pirates).<p>The short is: DRM is malware, Microsoft secured Windows against malware, DRM broke.",1439914054

In many ways we are far more qualified to support these machines than the techs they send over.  I mean, we could actually design these machines from scratch.<p>No, you can&#x27;t get tech manuals.  No, you can&#x27;t have access to internals.  Yes, there are a bunch of secret codes and you can&#x27;t have them.  And, yes, you will pay $1,000 (or whatever it was, I forget) for an additional 16 MEGA bytes of memory.<p>No, we are not eager to jump into a $200K machine to fiddle with it.  We are busy enough with our own work.  It&#x27;s about simple things.  When a machine goes down for some silly reason it&#x27;d be nice to be able to diagnose and get it back up and running rather than waste a bunch of time waiting for a tech who is going to enter a few secret codes to do the same.  I&#x27;ve seen it done a bunch of times and it is infuriating.<p>I also do understand that the typical big iron CNC user doesn&#x27;t have our profile.  We are not a production shop.  We have a well stocked CNC shop for prototyping product designs, just like we have pick-and-place capabilities in house.  We are a product engineering firm staffed with highly experienced engineers, not a machine shop.<p>I can see a company like Haas deciding &quot;no way we are giving access to internals to machinist&quot;.

10079910,comment,10074245,10074245,0,0,bbeneschott,,,"Background: I am the COO of Toptal<p>While these technical problems with Upwork’s platform certainly do seem very problematic, I’m not sure that “now is the time to roll out a new freelance platform” is the right conclusion, at least not without some revision.<p>- For starters, there are plenty of open freelance marketplaces out there that operate pretty much exactly in the same way as Upwork (Freelancer.com, for example). Some are more specialized (like 99designs), but in general the list is pretty endless. Adding another identical platform to the mix is unlikely to accomplish much.<p>- The real issue is that the operating model for freelance platforms has been broken. This has been the case for a long time, and is unrelated to Upwork’s technical issues.<p>The open marketplace model falls short in several ways, many of which relate to the “race to the bottom” phenomenon that other responses here mention:<p>For companies:<p>a. There’s no quality assurance and profiles/test scores can be fabricated.<p>b. You have to deal with a large volume of bids, and sifting through them defeats one of the top reasons people hire freelancers: to move fast.<p>c. There’s very little in the way of protection on any engagement. The risk of your project getting botched by someone incompetent or your freelancer disappearing is significant.<p>For freelancers:<p>a. Talented professionals have to deal with absurdly low bids from unqualified people. Many freelancers are forced to lower their rate to below what they’re worth just to get any work.<p>b. The large volume of bids for most projects means that it can be much tougher to stand out. The most talented freelancers are often the worst self-promoters.<p>c. There’s no protection from clients with unrealistic expectations.<p>Long-term, these are the problems that successful freelance models will need to be able to solve at scale. Is this doable? I certainly think so - it’s what we’ve been working on at Toptal. Here’s what we believe the solution looks like, and therefore how we’ve built Toptal to behave:<p>- All engagements need to solve these problems both for freelancers and for clients. Clients are looking for great freelancers and freelancers are looking for great clients. Therefore the solution is to thoroughly vet both freelancers AND clients.<p>- Vetting must be rigorous and done in a non-automated, non-riggable, extremely thorough way.
Freelancers must be able to set their own rates and not have to worry about low-bid contests. Only clients with serious projects who are ready to pay freelancers what they’re worth need apply. No race to the bottom.<p>- There must be a high level of support during ALL engagements, even at scale. Clients should only meet freelancers who were handpicked for their project, and vice versa. This also solves the problem of high bid volumes.<p>- Support should continue throughout the engagement to resolve conflicts and ensure success.<p>This is exactly how Toptal has operated for several years now for freelance software developers, and it has worked quite well--even though we made some mistakes along the way. While this has been primarily in the software development space thus far, the principles apply to other types of freelance work as well.<p>Bottom line: Upwork’s technical issues are certainly problematic, but there are larger issues that freelance platform models will need to solve in the long run.",1439913726

Here is the story of Tessel, who originally set out to do it the other way around (implement JavaScript on LuaJIT) but reversed course after two years: <a href=""https://tessel.io/blog/112888410737/moving-faster-with-iojs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tessel.io/blog/112888410737/moving-faster-with-iojs</a><p>&quot;We believed that over time we could cover all of the corner cases of JavaScript with our own runtime, but perhaps we should have taken a cue from the “Wat talk” that it was going to be an uphill battle. While the semantics between JavaScript and Lua are very similar, they are also just slightly different in many ways (For example, the comparisons between null vs undefined vs falsy), and capturing all of those idiosyncrasies has proved frustrating for both the users and developers of the Runtime. [...]  I still do believe it’s possible to make a <i>nearly</i> compatible runtime, but it’s going to take much more work than we expected and that resource investment would be an unwise business decision.&quot;",1439913632

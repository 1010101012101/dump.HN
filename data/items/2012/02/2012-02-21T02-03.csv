It could also put some breaks on other more abusive copyright-related laws, like the ones about mass surveillance, or the seizure of a website without being found guilty first, and so on.<p>That's the good part about such an Act. The bad part is that it's just a law. The copyright industry could still try to make new laws that will override many of the things in the FIA. The only (potentially huge) problem for them is that this would be just like us fighting against a ""child pornography"" bill - only that this time they would be fighting against a ""Free Internet"" law.<p>Overall, I think it's a great idea in the short to medium term, to stop any upcoming draconian copyright laws, or to at least weaken some of the ones that have already passed. But in the long term, this law probably won't be very resilient, and we might need a full Constitutional Amendment, if we're serious about protecting the Internet for decades or more.<p>Edit: And I just saw they're thinking about a global treaty, too. That's even better. The Internet needs to be protected globally after all.",1329793160

Before that, I used (and still use some) DELL 30-inch monitors (2560x1600, 30"").<p>It's true that there are <i>more</i> low-res monitors in the market, but that's just because they cost a lot less. I haven't used a monitor less than 2560 pixels across for six or seven years, and the last Apple monitor I bought was in 2007.<p>EDIT: but I too would welcome a resolution arms race. I moved from the 30s to the 27s because the pixel density is <i>slightly</i> better... but it's a very modest improvement for all the time that's passed.",1329793141

3615031,comment,3614627,3614896,8,0,DrJokepu,,,"Here in Europe we almost exclusively drive standard shift cars only. In fact, I've never driven an automatic shift car until very recently when I've visited my American girlfriend's parents the first time and found that's it's simply impossible to rent a standard shift car in the US. After a few hours I had to realise that modern automatic transmission systems these days are so good that unless you have special needs, there's simply no need to drive or even to learn to drive stick shift anymore. They're incredibly smooth and clever and completely abstract away the complexity of changing gears. It's like magic.<p>However, ARC is not quite there yet. It's a very useful tool but it's still a rather imperfect abstraction. You have to understand the problems with loops in object graphs, strong and weak references and why they're needed, bridging and all the other things ARC can't do for you yet. Maybe in a few years it will be possible to completely forget about memory management but today you simply cannot write a well behaving Objective-C application without understanding what's happening under the hood when it comes to memory management.",1329793080

3615025,comment,3612431,3612994,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"The problem is that beforehand you don't necessarily know which features you are going to need to use. I am constantly discovering new useful features in most of the programs I use, having to install plugins for every feature I wanted to use would quickly become a pain , hamper discoverablity and the program would probably just end up back where it started in terms of size.<p>Besides when you have a program with a long load time, this is not necessarily correlated with the number of features, it's more likely that it's some core part of the program that is taking a good chunk of the initialization time.<p>The consistency argument is important, especially to anyone who has ever worked on telephone tech support. Being able to give somebody instructions on how to perform an action without having to worry about which of the 1000s of possible configurations their program is in is important.
This is probably one of the big reasons desktop Linux never took off.<p>Most professional programs like IDEs or photoshop are intended to be used by professional users anyway who will be likely to have a reasonably fast computer and will have invested some time in learning to operate the program properly.<p>Adobe has actually had quite a few competitors over the years, currently there are programs like PixelMator and in the past they have had JASC , Corel, Macromedia (until they bough them) and of course GIMP to contend with.<p>Joel Spolsky has a good article on this.

There are a lot of low end Android devices on the market _right now_ with worse browser performance than an iPhone 3 (I've got a <6month old Huawei U8110 here as an example). Sure, top-end Android devices compare well against an iPhone4S (I'm pretty impressed with the Galaxy SII I've got here), but the bulk of Android devices in the wild are not late-model-top-end devices.<p>I had to drop an entire development branch from a project late last year due to insufficient performance of mobile device on-handset ajax. (We fell back to on-server html rendering and innerHTML updates, and even _that_ is annoyingly slow to me on low-end phones.)<p>And unless you have gathered data showing otherwise, this _probably_ really does apply to you. I was collecting some mobile use data last week - across ~70 websites that I've got Google Analytics access to, the average mobile visits was 14%, and the peak was just over 28%. This was across a range of markets and a variety of levels of ""mobile friendliness"" of the web design. (Biggest and probably most obvious takeaways from that exercise: B2B sites are a standard deviation or more below average for mobile visits, personal/leisure B2C sites up to one or two SD's above average. 80+% of mobile visits exit on a page with contact details - a phone# or address.)",1329792842

Beyond that, it's a pain to manage, and totally screws up the whole ""separation of duties"" paradigm that the web community seems to be quickly forgetting as of late.<p>Keep your markup where it should be, in your HTML files, because as we all know, HTML is XML and XML is meant to give semantic meaning to data. JavaScript should be a means of transport for data to its relevant structure, not means of giving visual structure to data. Leave that to the HTML and CSS.<p>Even templating doesn't do it for me 100% of the time and there are better ways. I'm a heavy believer in separation of duties, and any JS programmer should be too.

The Metropolitan Area is most definitely socio-economically segregated and that is going to have an impact on the distribution of intellectuals. In the area there are some fairly solid institutions as well with intelligent researchers and employees working at them - atleast two med schools, two business schools, a handful of other misc. universities, a world class hospital system (BJC), some renown programs (e.g.,WashU DPT), and some respectable companies based in STL (e.g., Monsanto).  Startups might be another issue but I imagine with the business schools there would be some, albeit small, community.<p>Whenever I meet people that come to STL to study, I find they rarely leave the immediate campus area and if they do they usually only go downtown or to the big college spots like the Loop.

The question really is about whether or not some of these applications can tolerate errors in the order of 1%.</i><p>I think the idea here is threefold:<p>1.  The vast majority of computations do not need extremely high precision.  A billion times more floating-point operations go into rendering video for games every day than for MRI processing (made-up statistic).  Even now, we have double-precision floating point for this reason: most operations only need single-precision.<p>2.  Applications that need a particular level of precision can be written with that level of precision in mind.  If you know the ability of a particular operation to provide precision, and you are aware of the numerical properties of your algorithms, you can write faster code that is nevertheless still as accurate as necessary.  Most of this isn't done by normal programmers, but rather by numerical libraries and such.<p>3.  Many performance-intensive applications <i>already use</i> 16-bit floating point, even though it has very little native support in modern CPUs.  AAC Main Profile even mandates its use in the specification.  The world is not new to lower-precision floating point, and it has gained adoption <i>despite</i> its lack of hardware support on the most popular CPUs.<p>The entire idea that this is ""let's make ordinary computations less accurate"" is a complete straw man and red herring that nobody actually suggested.",1329790510

With ARC, we can just relax and let the compiler insert all those pesky retains and releases where it knows they should go.<p>There is no reason for newcomers to learn the old style.

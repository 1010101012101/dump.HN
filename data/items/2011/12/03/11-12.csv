If your treasury is low you may not even have a choice between investing or using the cloud to begin with.<p>So you are going to say: in the long run, opex is more expensive than a wise investment that pan out well.<p>That's called risk management, and is the main reason many companies choose cloud services over in-house. You might invest in the wrong hardware, the wrong licenses in the case of encoding audio/video, or the wrong Linux/*BSD/Windows administrators.

(Edit: the technical term for this is ""contour crafting"".)<p>Note however that what currently requires most human intervention isn't the heavy duty.  It is all the small work you have to do after: paint, floor, electricity, water, basic appliances.  To automate all that, you need to replace not only the human mind, you have to replace the human <i>hand</i>.<p>Also replacing the human mind is obvious, though not necessarily easy: as you suggest, keep the machine, automate it, throw the human operator out.<p>The human hand, on the other hand, will take some insight to be replaced: how will you lay out all the tubes and the wires?  You cannot really expect human-sized machines do the same work the humans currently do, <i>in the same way</i>.  The best solution is probably to to come up with clever ways to render the human hand unnecessary.

It's just as easy to say ""if content creators won't sell lossless music files, they don't have the right to create the content.""<p>Really, the market is just being efficient.  Right now, people want X.  They could buy X for the price of a plane ticket and a CD and spend 36 hours of their time to obtain it, or they could download a torrent and be done in minutes.  People are going to do the second one, regardless of the fact that they have no ""right"" to.  Why?  Because it's easier, and humans are lazy.<p>As soon as every piece of music ever made is available from one store as lossless files, then there will be no excuse for music piracy.  But as long as the middlemen want to segment the market artificially, the market is going to fight back.  It's the recording industry middlemen that are hurting the artists, not the pirates.  The pirates are just correcting the market.<p>(The same goes for movies.  Get rid of bullshit DRM like HDCP and region coding, and suddenly your sales will go way up.  People don't want to buy a special player / cable / monitor combo that supports strong cryptography.  They want to watch a movie.  So don't do that, or the pirates have you beat on features alone, even though <i>you</i> created the content.  That sounds fucked up because it is!

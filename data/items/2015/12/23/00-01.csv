10781407,comment,10775969,10781219,0,0,winstonewert,,,"Sure, it only affects you. The problem is that changes to superclass can now break your code.<p>For example, perhaps right now the function looks like this:<p><pre><code>    def get(self, url, method=&#x27;GET&#x27;):\n        ...\n\n    def post(self, url):\n        self.get(url, method=&#x27;POST&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nYou override get, to add some additional functionality. All is fine.<p>Then somebody realizes that the original code was silly, and rewrites it:<p><pre><code>    def get(self, url, method=&#x27;GET&#x27;):\n        if method != &#x27;GET&#x27;:\n           print &quot;DEPRECATED!&quot;\n        self.request(url, method=method)\n\n    def post(self, url):\n        self.request(url, method=&#x27;POST&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nIt seems to do the same thing, and probably passes all the same tests. But suddenly, now your code doesn&#x27;t get called for post requests and your additional functionality breaks in a mysterious way.<p>Perhaps its still your fault for doing a bad job subclassing, but its going to look like its the fault of the person who fixed the parent class.",1450832309

The most efficient method could be found under the &#x27;cold fusion&#x27; umbrella, and even if these methods turn out to be a different process than fusion, we still may end up learning something new anyway. For example, sonoluminescence has been linked to fusion before, but even if the processes involved end up being different to fusion, it&#x27;s still an interesting process:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJolILUbdNw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJolILUbdNw</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence</a><p>The point is, it doesn&#x27;t serve us to dismiss fields of scientific research that have some chance of bringing us a new understanding of the science involved, even if we end up scrambling around in the dark for a long time.",1450831767

The biggest bar to this is probably people with families/kids (which I personally hope to never have, but I respect that some people, including great employees/founders/etc., do and deeply value having family interactions) -- do whatever is possible to address this.  It&#x27;s probably not a one size fits all solution.  &quot;Live on site 2-3 days/week, wfh otherwise&quot; might actually be preferable to a lot of people with families than spending 1-2h/day commuting and 8-12h/day working 5 days/week.<p>1) Duration limited (say, a startup from 0 to 10-15 employees and $20mm/yr revenue -- could be 1-3y).  Even if the duration is long (3y), having a specific time where it will change as the default helps.<p>2) People who are inherently suited to this (which probably works well for, say, early career security people; not as well for civil engineers.)<p>3) Intermittent -- work/live like this for months at a time, then go back &quot;home&quot;.<p>4) High budget: live/work like this AND have enough money to have a &quot;regular&quot; house/apartment elsewhere, or at least go on great vacations.<p>5) Deep mission at the startup: &quot;save the world from spy agencies&quot;, yes.  &quot;Build a more efficient billing system for other startups&quot;, probably not.<p>6) Strongly prioritize &quot;no assholes rule&quot; in hiring. (The worst thing about having one coddled asshole is then everyone else feels the need to equivalently act like an asshole to be taken seriously; it&#x27;s self perpetuating)<p>7) Have an obvious physical reason for being in the same place -- easier to co-live in a remote location building a dam, than it is to co-live in an office park in Kentucky to build billing software.",1450831229

It feels like a significant historical regression; they speak as if Smalltalk and the Metaobject Protocol are things to revile and shun, not elegant programming models that we as programmers should aspire to understand and use in our own programs.<p>To elide these features as a matter of principle implies that you believe your compilation model is perfect, and is able to deduce all information necessary for optimal compilation of your program statically, perhaps augmented with profiling information you have obtained from earlier runs. It also makes upgrading programs for users more difficult since patches must be applied in a non-portable manner across programs. I shan&#x27;t mention the fact that they make iterative, interactive development an ordeal. The Swift REPL is progress (although REPLs for static languages are nothing new), but it still pales in comparison to the development and debugging experience in any Smalltalk or Lisp system.<p>There is no reason why the typing disciplines Swift is designed to support should demand the eradication of all dynamism in the runtime and object model.<p>If you have never heard of the Metaobject Protocol or similar concepts before, here is the standard reference: <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-metaobject-protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-metaobject-protocol</a><p>This discussion also reminds me of this essay by Richard P.

From a performance point of view, the only way Java (and dynamic languages like JavaScript) get away with having almost everything be virtual is that they can JIT under a whole-program analysis, add final automatically in the absence of subclassing, and deoptimize in the presence of classloaders. In other words, Java optimistically compiles under the assumption that classes that aren&#x27;t initially subclassed won&#x27;t be, and if that assumption later turns out to be invalid it deletes the now-incorrect JIT code and recompiles. This isn&#x27;t an option for Swift, which is ahead-of-time compiled and can&#x27;t recompile on the fly.<p>If you don&#x27;t allow an ahead of time compiler to devirtualize anything, you&#x27;re going to have worse method call performance than <i>JavaScript</i>.",1450831106

I remember using Steam when it was new for HL2.  I cracked open a beer to enjoy while it downloaded, happy i didn&#x27;t have to drive for a half hour or so to pick up a copy at gamestop.<p>I had good broadband. However, it took all day and evening until around 2-3 AM for it to finish downloading.  Things were over saturated i guess.  I didn&#x27;t re-use steam until a decade later since it left such a poor impression with their one 33.6 modem uploading the game to everyone.",1450829269

But I think you&#x27;re ignoring what others are saying about where dynamic typing shines:  Where you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing <i>to the point that you don&#x27;t know what the proper types look like.</i>  You can try things faster in a dynamic language in that situation, because you can sweep the &quot;don&#x27;t know what the types look like&quot; part under the rug, and experiment with algorithms, and let that experimentation show you what the types ought to be.  In some situations, that can be faster/easier/better than trying, from first principles and analysis, to determine what the types must be.<p>I think the difference is that I (and, I suspect, you) spend little of our time in that mode, and much more in the mode where static types can save your behind.

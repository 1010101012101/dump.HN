I spend all my time working on it, and when I'm not working, I'm thinking about it. I've been lucky enough to bring two other great people on and am in late stages of negotiating with a salesperson as well as bringing on two interns.<p>TouchBase is currently in private release with the goal of attaining 40 parents and 60 children by November 22. We will release the app in the third week of December if all of our plans don't get a major overhaul. Hope to see you there.",1271874896,1452889144

costan,,203,1.0,5,24,"Victor Costan got infected with a passion for coding at the age of 10, and proceeded to earn a M.Eng in Computer science from MIT. Victor also holds a B.S. in Management that he pursued as he fell prey to the belief that great software requires legions of developers manipulating bloated code bases in repetitive ways.<p>Thanks to Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, Ruby, and Rails, he re-discovered the joy of coding, and came back from the dark ways of management. Nowadays, Victor is still crazy about building software that he can impress his friends with, but he also dreams of contributing to making coding even more enjoyable. Victor likes developing mobile and Web 2.0 applications, and occasionally enjoys building some distributed systems behind the apps.<p>When he is not coding, you will most likely find him reading up on some new programming language or software development technique. At times, Victor likes to pretend he&#x27;s mentally sane, and can be seen catching up with friends, watching a movie, or exploring Boston.<p>[ my public key: https://keybase.io/pwnall; my proof: https://keybase.io/pwnall/sigs/I1Vine_PdNepU6Sn-s9TOSooWaVBmAzUVlm_OVuOM0A ]",1241664785,1450207814

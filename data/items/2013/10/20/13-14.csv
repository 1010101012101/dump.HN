How do you know how much the person after you owes? It may work at drive ins but it&#x27;s certainly impossible at a normal queue -- except if people leave a &quot;standard amount&quot; regardless of what the next order actually is.<p>And even at a drive-in where the amount of the next order is known, it&#x27;s probably a big hassle for the cashier -- if not downright impossible: the point-of-sale system wants the exact amount if paid by card, and if using cash it&#x27;s even more complex (the POS system tells the cashier how much to give back, and now this is false and has to be somewhat reconciled at the end of the day).<p>This sounds completely fake.",1382277561

6579891,comment,6577610,6577930,1,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Adults weren&#x27;t dropping dead at 30.</i><p>To the contrary, adults died in young adulthood in early prehistory. That is, surviving infancy and childhood still led to a harsh life with high mortality, with most human beings dying before age fifty. The last time this came up in a Hacker News thread, I forgot to refer to the better source[1] I know about Pleistocene human mortality. Looking up just now, I see that there is an even more current and specific source[2] that reports &quot;An assessment of younger (2040 y) versus older (>40 y) adult mortality distributions for late archaic humans (principally Neandertals) and two samples of early modern humans (Middle Paleolithic and earlier Upper Paleolithic) provides little difference across the samples. All three Late Pleistocene samples have a dearth of older individuals compared with Holocene ethnographic/historical samples. They also lack older adults compared with Holocene paleodemographic profiles that have been critiqued for having too few older individuals for subsistence, social, and demographic viability. Although biased, probably through a combination of preservation, age assessment, and especially Pleistocene mobility requirements, these adult mortality distributions suggest low life expectancy and demographic instability across these Late Pleistocene human groups. They indicate only subtle and paleontologically invisible changes in human paleodemographics with the establishment of modern humans; they provide no support for a life history advantage among early modern humans.&quot;<p>[1] <i>The Nature of Paleolithic Art,</i> by R.

Other countries that have been in the news for a high age of first marriage and a very low birthrate are Italy and Taiwan. What is similar about those countries, and what is different about them, alongside Japan? I have read that Taiwan (where I have lived during two different three-year periods of foreign residence and work) has the highest age of first marriage, and one of the lowest birthrates, of any country in the world. But Taiwan&#x27;s culture is distinct from that of Japan, and some of the relevant workplace conditions and government policies are a bit different too. So what is the causation here?",1382274509

Absutely no name => unsafe, Obscure or semi obscure Chinese manufacturer => probably OK, Well known global brand => depends (and depends on what the charger is for, nobody is going to manufacture fake Delta-branded charger for iPhone, but fake Delta-branded power bricks for various networking equipment are fairly common).<p>Power quality on input is certainly an issue, but only for totally out of spec inputs. Small wide input SMPS (like these for laptops) just run hotter on lower voltages because of their internal construction (lower voltage => higher current => higher losses).",1382274463

Let&#x27;s think about bowling. From the DSM-5 point of view, happiness is scoring a &quot;clean game&quot; with all strikes, i.e. the lack of mistakes. Isn&#x27;t this the same as &quot;happiness is the absence of disorders&quot;?

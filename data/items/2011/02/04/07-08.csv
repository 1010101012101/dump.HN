Gawker has been hating Thiel for some time.<p>I have seen this said about Thiel hundreds of times, and it's just not true. He said that from a strictly Libertarian perspective - from the perspective of political freedom - things 'went downhill' when women got the vote because women tend to more consistently vote in favour of social programs and thereby in favor of expanding the state and decreasing personal liberties, once those programs get introduced via legislation. Therefore, he doesn't suggest to not let women vote, as Gawkers ""suggests"", he just states his conviction that times are difficult for libertarians.<p>Also, having written a book precisely about the difference between statements being offensive and just being perceived as offensive by PC culture, all this must make Thiel shake his head about the reading comprehension of the general public.",1296805510

I've already done a lot at 22 years of age, but reading the posts here and seeing what some of the older people have accomplished is just simply amazing. It is always fantastic to read someone else's take on various different ideas especially those who are older than me.<p>I currently work at a small startup with people who have been in the game for a long time (I along with 1 other programmer are in our 20's the rest of the team is 40's or more) and it is an absolute blast learning new things at an extremely rapid pace.<p>It was after only 3 months at this small startup, in the middle of things (I'd done my own startup but this was when the ah ha moment happened) I realised that my passion was to be a part of a small team that changed the world, and not be stuck in a big corporation somewhere chugging away with no real way to differentiate myself from everyone else there.<p>That is why I am really happy to be a part of the HN community where I can learn more information, and hopefully someday soon in the near future I too will have a successful small business with millions of dollars in revenue.",1296802956

Is is really worth sacrificing native performance and consistency for such marginal gain?",1296802890

So, what/who does everybody listen to when they hack?<p>I tend to stick with classical/techno/anything without words as lyrics usually distract me from the task at hand.<p>How about you? What are you listening to right now?",1205855957

139878,comment,138966,139475,0,0,mattjones,,,"Interesting question.  Perhaps we will witness a renewed proliferation of domesticated animals in this millennium, a sort of ""domestication 2.0"".  Robotics may actually help inspire it, along with our knowledge of so many more kinds of animals.  As robot designers study lots of different critters to improve their products, people will start thinking, ""Hm, some of these animals have skills.""  The range of animals we've made use of so far is probably tiny compared to the range that could be useful.  And our ability to breed or engineer them in desirable directions has improved a lot.  So yes, maybe there will be real mules too, or some other kind animal we haven't thought of yet.

139874,comment,139725,139762,0,0,dhimes,,,"I started with Java Swing (O'Reilly) and Complete Reference (Schildt).  It's funny--Java's tough, but I really didn't know the difference because I had no GUI language with which to compare.  I had done a lot of (non-GUI) work in Mathematica (which I love), so I found Java cumbersome, but I also was interested by the story of the development of OOP and I figured it was worthwhile to learn.<p>Now I've found Python, which has a lot of the characteristics of Mathematica, and is very fun.  But I have to fix my Java printing issues before I can play with it.  (If I can figure out how to deploy it as a GUI desktop app I could better justify spending more time with it).",1205853904

Don't get stuck in PHP-think mentality, and definitely make sure to understand the things about Python or Ruby that make them functional ASAP.<p>Learning to understand macros in Lisp also really helps you think better, that's what people keep repeating. From what I understand, it blurs the line between that interface of the language to the compiler/interpreter, which seems cool.<p>I'm definitely a newbies still (in all Lisp, Python, Ruby).",1205853773

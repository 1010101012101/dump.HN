However, it's worth noting that no market operates at perfect efficiency, and even in the big straight pipe there will be leaks. What's most interesting to me about this image of the future is where the arbitrage opportunities will be around the edges of the future pipe. Because they will certainly be there. You have to wonder what the aggressively ambitious entrepreneurial types will be doing once ""tomorrow's startup"" becomes equivalent to ""today's college education and job.""

If you're being kind (or unkind), you're still focused on the person -- quit it!  Focus on the work!<p>If someone digs a hole in the wrong freakin' place, you don't say ""gee, I really appreciate your work digging that hole as deep as you did but it seems something wasn't made clear enough to you, which is that the hole is intended be located over there, where, as you can see, it would work much better.""  Argh!  Just say ""Oh no, the hole is supposed to be over there!""<p>I know this seems like a tone-deaf socially ignorant approach, but here's the thing.  You're on the same team as the person whose work (not them) you're criticizing.  If it might seem like you're not, make that clear first.  Criticism must be a cooperative thing.  Purely antagonistic criticism is evil.<p>And make clear what your taste is.  There's a huge difference between ""I hate it"" and ""it's horrible,"" between subjective and objective.  A front page with a out-of-place word-art logo?  That's an ""I hate it"" -- I just think it's ugly.  A user registration page with two screenfuls of fields to fill out?  That's an ""it's horrible"" -- it just doesn't work.<p>But maybe I'm wrong.  A side project for me is studying creative leadership, and this is some of the stuff I've picked up.  So if you have a different view, please blast away; I'd like to hear it.",1191566671

63478,comment,63403,63403,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Would you recommend getting a residential apartment and working from home, or getting an office and sleeping on the couch/cot at night? ...""</i><p>You mean you get a choice? Apartment every time. Why? <p>Unless you can get a good office, your apartment is going to be more comfortable, close to the essentials fridge, terminal, bed (not needed if you fall asleep at the terminal) and kitchen. A determinant factor is also access to a internet connection.<p>Your time is only 3months. By then you will have created something and require a new office.  Then again if you do get an office make sure it is just a bit better than home so you (and others) stay there.

63472,comment,63009,63009,0,0,gingerk,,,"So much to think about. One niggling question I have is related to the definition of ""start ups"". I've heard and read varying opinions. Is a start up a new business with an idea to execute on the web or is a start up a company that executes an idea on the the web or is it both or neither? Depending on the definition of start up, there will be vastly different business models, challenges and economic opportunities.

63467,comment,63437,63437,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I often wonder what could be achieved by privateers with just a fraction of NASA's annual funding. Just look at the incredible pace that X-Prize teams develop on comparatively minuscule budgets! <p>If you think about it, the situation mirrors that of startups. A small team of ""hackers"" can now build aeronautical technology better, faster, and cheaper than the big behemoth NASA can. And the reasons are also similar, in that it now costs less to build spacecraft than it used to. <p>Incidentally, some of these space ""startups"" are run by hackers. Like Armadillo Aerospace, which was co-founded by id Software's John Carmack. I guess hacking on aeronautics is in the same spirit as hacking on software.<p>I would really like to see what this article proposes: Focus on giving money to space ""startups"" and let NASA focus on the things that a slower moving, big company can do well, like research.",1191564576

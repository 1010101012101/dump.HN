Only whether or not is it reliable.)<p>If it&#x27;s cheap and easy for the enemy to produce misinformation that&#x27;s indistinguishable from the real thing, then it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that the enemy will do so (and it&#x27;s a good idea to do so with our own information).

But it&#x27;s going to suck at cornering. We currently don&#x27;t have anything that can hold such high average speeds as an F1 car can. Not even in any very lightly regulated sport.<p>For interestingness&#x27; sake, modern WRC cars reach speeds of 220kph over gravel.<p>Top speeds of F1 cars are around 360kph (the Bugatti Veyron can do 430kph), but F1 cares more about cornering speed than top speed.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>> The large downforce allows an F1 car to corner at amazing speeds. As an example of the extreme cornering speeds; the Blanchimont and Eau Rouge corners at Spa-Francorchamps are taken flat-out at above 300 km/h (190 mph), whereas the race-spec touring cars can only do so at 150–160 km/h (note that lateral force increases with the square of the speed). A newer and perhaps even more extreme example is the Turn 8 at the Istanbul Park circuit, a 190° relatively tight 4-apex corner, in which the cars maintain speeds between 265 and 285 km/h (165 and 177 mph) (in 2006) and experience between 4.5 g and 5.5 g for 7 seconds—the longest sustained hard cornering in Formula 1.",1386071675

The equipment connected to our gateway (the project I was assigned to work on) via RS-232 cables, communicating using a standard protocol known as HL7.<p>Standard cables, standard protocol -- what could possibly go wrong?  The answer: Everything.  Everyone interpreted RS-232 in whatever they wanted.  Everyone ignored the parts of HL7 they disliked, and added things that were &quot;obviously&quot; important.  Getting decent documentation was nearly impossible.<p>The bottom line is that software development is relatively easy when you&#x27;re in a vacuum.  The moment that you need to integrate with someone else&#x27;s system, things get complex and difficult.  And when you have to deal with several vendors, each of which has implemented a superset of a subset of the standard, things get even crazier.<p>When I was editing the student newspaper in college, our editing/layout computer system stopped talking to our typesetting system.  The vendors blamed each other for failing to do the right thing.  We had technicians come in from both companies, and they basically yelled at each other, saying that <i>he</i> was not implementing the standards correctly.<p>So yes, the Obamacare Web site will go down in software history as a cautionary tale.  But if they still haven&#x27;t gotten the back end to communicate with the individual insurance vendors, then I fear that the debugging process is far from complete.

Sure, adding a value tilt gives you an expectation of beating the market.  Doing so on a risk-adjusted basis, after taking into account both increased volatility and the idiosyncratic risks of value stocks, is more difficult.<p>That said, if one is not sensitive to those idiosyncratic risks - ie if they have good job security and/or a large financial cushion - a value tilt can indeed provide an edge over the market.

So I grabbed one leftover ceramic floor tile, couple of stair wooden balusters and some thin plywood. I sawed each baluster in half (they had central symmetry), screwed them to plywood on both sides, glued ceramic tile to plywood from one side and small pillars to the other side and then painted wood. Couple of hours of work and got myself a pretty slick looking side table, which I needed at the time :)\nThe only thing I bought were small silver pillars which cost couple of dollars.<p>Here&#x27;s photo: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6OsLDPu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/6OsLDPu.jpg</a><p>Bender&#x27;s picture is also some kind of hacking, I printed picture at the local photo workshop and made the frame from a very cheap plastic ceiling plinth.",1386069810

The correct analogy would be &quot;it&#x27;s useless to have a sword because my enemy has a magic shield that is easy to use, impossible to detect and will hurt me if I hit it&quot;. If such shields existed, then certainly, they would make swords useless.<p>Likewise, it&#x27;s reasonable to deduce that certain kinds of intelligence gathering are useless if you start from the premise that counter intelligence is easy to generate and difficult to detect. If you disagree with that conclusion, then I think you probably disagree with the premise rather than the logical argument. I don&#x27;t know anything about spying, but if you can share some insight into whether or not the premise holds water, that would be interesting. The article specifically talks about examples where counter intelligence would be hard to generate or easy to detect. What did you think of those examples? Do you have more? Do you have insight into why counter intelligence would be harder to generate or easier to detect in general?",1386069468

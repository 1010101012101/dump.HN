3935417,comment,3933478,3935261,1,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"Right! Foolish programmer!  Using REP MOVSB has been broken since about the 2nd issuance of the processor. Dumb folks (read: DOS) used it as a timing loop to calibrate interrupt timers, complained when it got faster and broke their code so Intel 'dumbed it down' til its about the worst way to move memory you could try.<p>So you say it works again. Cool!<p>Maybe what we really need is some sort of 'architecture library' that compilers resort to for things like this. Maybe an instruction, maybe a routine, but guaranteed to work for every wrinkle in the architecture.<p>Because if its not in the compiler, folks will continue to cobble together buggy code of their own, with only a vague idea of the vast architecture landscape they are navigating blindly.",1336319975

I often skim through js source to learn new tricks - and obfuscation doesn't really stop me (apart from google's java-translated js) . With compiled NaCl I probably wouldn't be able to find out a lot.<p>I'm not talking about ""stealing user data"" when I say sneaky code. No, with compiled native code a whole new game is started: computational-intensive code.

It's an amazing city, but this article says absolutely nothing about the growth or stability in that country. From my understanding (and I didn't dive to deeply into it on my visit), the current leadership is making moves which are very threatening to long-term prosperity and stability. As the article mentions, they are nationalizing industries and restricting imports which is going to set-up walls between them and other countries. Combing that with aggressive posturing regarding the Faukland/Malvinas Islands does little to give much confidence in the opportunities in Argentina.<p>Just my 2 cents from the little I gained while there.",1336319894

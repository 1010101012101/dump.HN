Its almost as if they think that their emotions, feelings, perceptions of social status, cultural &#x27;way its done&#x27; behaviors etc. matter to them!<p>Actually, I just want to point out if you&#x27;ve had any training on how to run a training session, you ought to know that asking &quot;do you understand?&quot; is pointless in every culture. From an asian culture it can even come across as threatening and dominating. Its like asking &quot;do you want to keep your job?&quot;. Who is going to stand up and say &quot;actually, no I don&#x27;t&quot; to that?

If you want to do it full time, get used to that happening <i>a lot</i>.  The risk of it has to be built into your weekly rates.<p>Also, your projection that you will have 1.8X your monthly expenses in March is a <i>projection</i> -- in the real world of freelancing, you&#x27;re going to have things like &quot;client flaked on the project; two weeks which I had assumed sold are now empty&quot;, &quot;client refuses to pay $10,000 invoice&quot;, &quot;I had to pay $3,000 out of my pocket for professional liability insurance to secure the next gig&quot;, etc etc.  And if you think that level of cash flow juggling is fun, wait until you have employees!<p>You should, as soon as reasonably practical, stop sourcing gigs from oDesk/elance/etc and start sourcing them from clients who pay professional wages for professional work.",1393498432

So I believe science will never truly understand enlightenment, because science is intellectualization. Besides there are several grades of enlightenment, don&#x27;t think you meditate a few years and you get it.<p>As for meditation, although it is the best path for enlightenment, turns out there&#x27;s alot of benefits for common people. When you bring your thoughts to a halt, your true mind manifests. The true mind is unimpeded - it is effortless - and this true mind allows you to solve your daily problems more easily. You shut off your &quot;stupid&quot; brain, and the true wisdom starts to manifest. You won&#x27;t become a zombie; you will <i>naturally</i> discard your stupid habits and become better focused at whatever is that you do.<p>What this means is that throughout the day we are able to gain a better understanding of ourselves and our environment; we will become gradually less scattered (due to the meditation process) and we will focus on what is important to us, wheter its programming or science or anything else. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I think it&#x27;s a good basic description.",1393498426

PhD students <i>are not</i> required <i>to sign any contract</i> or <i>to be paid any salary</i>.<p>2.1. Some of them have a &quot;doctoral contract&quot; (a new thing created in 2009 specially for PhD students), some are public servants, some have signed regular employment contracts of three years specifically for the PhD. However, a large part do not get any benefit from the doctoral school: they are either unemployed, or have a job unrelated to their PhD.<p>2.2. The director of the doctoral school is supposed to check that all conditions, including financial ones, are met so the student can work well.<p>* * *<p>Addendum:<p>- At the beginning of the 2000s, 30% of students dropping out of their PhD said it was <i>&quot;for financial reasons&quot;</i> [1].<p>- PhD students are almost always enrolled in a university, or in an institution related to the doctoral school. This is about 500€/year if you are lucky enough to be French, but can go up to 7000€/year if you are from outside the EU.<p>- Some institutions, for instance some <i>Écoles des Mines</i> or the <i>École Polytechnique</i>, still pay PhD students an &quot;informal salary&quot; without any employment contract [2].

It speeds up development of all the simple stuff , and by the time it gets complicated, you can drop down to SQL.<p>I don&#x27;t  find the two ways of thinking incompatible, in fact the &quot;extra&quot; method on Djangos ORM is an intermediate where you let the ORM do its normal simple style of mapping, but allows you to add extra clauses to the SQL manually. Once you do this you see how the ORM works, and can choose quite easily when it is appropriate to use it.<p>You loose a bit of the magic that comes with Django by the time your queries get more complex (like auto generated admin pages), but the benefits outweigh the costs immensely in my case.",1393497745

(...)&quot;<p>If your argument is based on dissing with a &quot;Christianity cannot immediately explain away&quot; concept, it&#x27;s not an argument. Does a discussion require a clock? I find this more of a neutral statement. As of the evolution - it&#x27;s just a theory that may or may not be true. How come other animals didn&#x27;t evolve to create hivemind or other exotic form of civilisation?<p>&quot;2. On that note, one of the historical problems of the Bible is that there is absolutely no evidence for any Adam or Garden of Eden. In fact, there is much evidence against it, most of it from the findings that support evolution.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden#Proposed_locations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden#Proposed_locatio...</a>\nWhile we are talking about the Garden - there was no apple, but a &quot;fruit&quot; due to error with translations in ancient times of past.<p>Adam:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam#Etymology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam#Etymology</a>\nsame goes for Eve:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve#Etymology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve#Etymology</a>\nlet&#x27;s also accept:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve#Scientific_community_criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve#Scientific_communi...</a>\nI know also of a translation in my language,\nthat instead of &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; uses the &quot;the Man&quot; and &quot;That-of-the-Man&quot;.<p>While I don&#x27;t prove that Garden existed, it may be treated like a story.<p>&quot;3. Another historical problem with the Bible is that it is abundantly clear to any student of geography that there has never been a global flood. There cannot have been. There’s no evidence from the rocks. Besides, there isn’t enough water on the planet.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a good one :)\nIt is true - there is not enough _fluid_ water on the planet.

Further, not even Abraham is a historical character. He is a literary invention, as even Wikipedia shows.&quot;<p>Well, if wikipedia says so. But even Wikipedia is _unsure_ wherever he did or did not exist.<p>&quot;5. Continuing the historical problems, Moses is another character from the Bible who never existed. There was no wandering through the desert for 40 years, and no plagues of Egypt, and no Commandments from Mount Sanai. I’m not a historian and this is meant to be brief, so I’m not presenting the evidence for these last few assertions, but these Biblical figures being fictional is almost as commonly accepted among historians as evolution is among biologists.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Historicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Historicity</a><p>I have to comment on your &quot;haste&quot;.

On a different hand, there are several moral problems with Christianity and/or the Bible. In particular, the Bible forbids neither slavery nor rape. Indeed, it allows the beating of slaves as long as they don’t die for at least a day or two (Exodus 21:20-21). In the case of rape, the woman can be put to death for adultery if she doesn’t scream loud enough (Deuteronomy 22:23-24) or be forced to marry her rapist (Deuteronomy 22:28-29). Clearly, these are NOT moral positions! (If you disagree, please seek help.)&quot;<p>So. I disagree. Grab Catechism of the Catholic Church if you&#x27;re looking for law regarding men.\nAlso I have _never_ seen, heard etc of using Deuteronomy in our &quot;time&quot;.<p>Is this a problem with Christianity? No.<p><a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22&version=KJV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22&v...</a>\nBible doesn&#x27;t forbid slavery and rape?\nI. It&#x27;s the Old Testament.\nII. From what I know slavery isn&#x27;t forbidden because it&#x27;s common (do you realise I&#x27;m talking about the times author wrote the Deutheronomy?).\nIII. Because rape is not forbidden it _does NOT_ mean it&#x27;s allowed.\n(sorry for using KJV)<p>&quot;7. Further, many sects of Christianity still forbid all forms of homosexuality, masturbation, and extramarital sex. While we should certainly not approve of cheating, there is no reason to forbid other consenting acts of sex. (...)&quot;<p>O. Sects? Okay...\nI. How does this prove || disprove God?\nII. Because homosexuality is unnatural event. We (so do I) believe that God created &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;. That&#x27;s how babies are not born.\nIII. Wet dreams? Show me quote of the Bible concerning this.\nIIII. Love is not only about senseless and brainless pleasure. \nV. You say before God, that you love her/him (your spouse) and next few years you say: &quot;well, God. I don&#x27;t love her but I love another one. Sorry but I made a mistake&quot;. There may be good reasons for divorce, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not forbidden, but _strongly_ and often denied (more of a last resort).<p>&quot;8. Another moral problem with Christianity, or at least many sects of it, is that it forbids abortion and contraception. There is no moral argument for forbidding contraception. It does not end a life; it prevents one from beginning. (...)&quot;<p>My, you are totally wrong and you even don&#x27;t know it.<p>I. _If_ &quot;There is no moral argument for forbidding contraception. It does not end a life;&quot; Well done, you just used your own argument to prove, that if purpose of _abortion is to end life_ (KILLS) it is morally &quot;wrong / bad / evil&quot;.\nII. Contraception pills? You mean those hormones and chemicals women take, and then the fertilized egg can&#x27;t merge(?) with womb? It&#x27;s the _same_ as abortion, but here the child doesn&#x27;t have the body which could defend it from killing her.<p>The problem with abortion is not due to killing - we all should know that&#x27;s bad.\nThe problem lies in rape.<p>&quot;However, if it is entirely illegal, it leads to women being thrown in jail for miscarriages.&quot;\nPlease - evidence. I need to use arguments, so i need sources.&quot;<p>&quot;To me, this alone is enough to convince that abortion needs to be legal for at least the first trimester.&quot;\nThis is becoming absurd. Hey, lets kill someone if we &quot;just don&#x27;t have the time to be a parent&quot;.\nAbsurd: Yes, it&#x27;s legal to kill during first trimester, but you shan&#x27;t kill a second after.\nWho gave you right to decide of life and death?",1393495665

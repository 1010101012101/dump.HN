Dancehall producers will create an instrumental (riddim) and then release it publicly as a dub plate for the many different MCs to rhyme over. This results in a large number of versions of the same instrumental being played by DJs in clubs around Kingston. Quickly the response from the dancefloor combined with the DJ's opinion filters out worse versions and leaves one track standing above the rest. This track will then be the big smash on that riddim and really blow up. That track is typically the best vocal on the best riddim. It's wisdom of crowds applied to the composite elements of the track.<p>As the free availability of individual tunes results in more remixing, more collaboration and more playlisting a system that determines the optimal permutations will be very valuable. My guess is that the optimal permutations will be inferred from the behaviour of music fans on the web so no one will own it as such, however the experts and tastemakers will become more visible and may be able to monetise this ability.<p>Live recordings will become more important because as albums get broken up by file sharing the selection an artist chooses in concert will become more meaningful.",1199469193

The GREAT thing about Hacker News is that it covers startup and programming news and is a wonderful resource without me having to go through loads of stuff I'm not interested in, or (more importantly) that I can find elsewhere",1199469175
94858,comment,94765,94813,0,0,nkohari,,,"YES. The demise of the EP is almost as tragic as that of B-sides. I wish more bands released EPs rather than full albums, because there's always a couple of songs that make you think, ""how did that get in there?"" (Still, like I said above, I greatly prefer listening to a group of songs rather than singles.)",1199469089

If you needed a separate copy of Apache running for each instance of your Rails app, I would agree that you would have trouble. :) I am interested in how painful it is to scale Rails. Twitter is by far the largest deployment and we all know they had some growing pains. I'm a big fan of Ruby, and I'm using it in a side project that I hope to turn into a startup, but I'm concerned that I might run into trouble in the long-term. (I'm a .NET developer by day, but I'm not willing to commit to Windows hosting, and I'm not too confident in mod_mono either...)",1199468638

6765890,comment,6764482,6764482,15,0,npalli,,,"Slightly disappointing to see the anti-founder sentiment expressed here. To recap --<p>1. The founders started from zero with their own equity and worked for six years on the startup. They took funding during &#x27;99 and &#x27;00 when it was a very easy time to get funding. Completely unremarkable investment (risk-wise) for the investors.<p>2. The dot-com crash and 9/11 meant that many many businesses collapsed post 2000. So, it wasn&#x27;t just founder incompetence. There are many startups that almost went under but slowly managed to get out and have exits during the late &#x27;00s.<p>3. Apparently the investors thought the company was good enough to continue investing under the same name with new management. If the idea was so useless why didn&#x27;t they shut it down in 2000?<p>4. Most of the value of startups is created after the first several years. Many lessons are learned that give direction to future opportunities. Many of the startups that almost went under and came up, learned to pivot (same management).<p>The lesson to learn here is that the founder were not diligent about control over their company. It is not like the investors did some calculation of value demonstrated to come up with the numbers. They automatically started adding 8% of company shares every year based on the 2000 agreement.<p>To give a counter example to make things clear, Microsoft started in 1975 with Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Allen was diagnosed with Cancer and pretty much stopped working at Microsoft after 1982. After six years. How much audit-able value did Microsoft created post Paul Allen?. I would say about 99%. Does that mean he should be zeroed out? No. He kept his stake (worth tens of billions). That&#x27;s how it should be.<p>Most of the value in a startup is latent during the early stages. Even things that don&#x27;t work out teach you things. If you go by audit-able value, that pretty much guarantees early founders (who don&#x27;t stay) will get wiped out. For people who are cheering on the investors, how many of you have bootstrapped a startup for six years?",1384912708

Interestingly, despite that rapid change, the set of prepositions, the set of conceptual relationships we&#x27;ve chosen to concisely express, stays pretty steady.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to read about a new preposition entering into common usage, because it makes me wonder what new pressures we&#x27;re collectively facing in describing conceptual relationships.

I have CS 458 (computer security) this term. We had an assignment last month asking us to get all the users permission without knowing their password for a web app. Then I wrote a script. The use of the script is to use curl one time per second (may be longer, due to the connection issue) to guess all the different combination of the password. Of course I was using that script on Digital Ocean!<p>After running it two days, I receive an email saying their router find out that I was doing the DDOS and ask me to stop it. I stop the script immediately and reply them my reason telling them that I was doing it for University Assignment and I don&#x27;t know that I was not allowed to do this. However, my account got suspends anyway. No matter how I send emails to beg them to give back my files in the server (I use the server for emacs and tmux to write codes for school projects), they just told me that sorry but my account is suspend. No matter how I beg them, all I received back from the email is just a max two line saying that my account is suspend. They do tell me that it suspends forever. After several days they deleted my account with all my files in it. Now I have no ways to get any of my files back! I feel ... so angry and hate so much about the digital ocean.<p>Is this how a normal American Company does? Will a normal American Company suspends customers account because that customer use it to do university work? I can understand it suspends me if I violate any laws but I was just doing an assignment and not violates anything. It also ignore the apology from the customer. Any evidence the customer provides is ignored gets well. Even that after couple days, digital ocean deleted that customer&#x27;s account with all his files permanently!<p>This is my story.

It&#x27;s not a run-of-the-mill startup (so far we&#x27;ve worked with the NHS, the RAF and a whole raft of local businesses and innovators). I&#x27;ve had the chance to play with a lot of cool technologies (Nodejs, Go, MongoDB, Redis, Phonegap etc) and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. If we get off of the ground, there is a directorship waiting for me when I graduate.<p>Succeeding as a company however, is going to mean working hard for it this year, not something I can do alongside studying at uni. I can probably coast my degree and get a 2:1 or 2:2 or I can focus and almost certainly end up with a first. Which is going to count for more in the long run?

It might naively seem they would at first because the value of the payments on a loan with a given principal and interest rates would seem to be more, but <i>in relation to the value of just holding the money in cash</i> there would be no difference, so nothing to drive an increased propensity to lend.<p>So, while interest rates would probably go down, it wouldn&#x27;t be a source of benefit to lenders, it would be a consequence of the decreased attractiveness of borrowing.<p>> Also many people argue the same thing about printing money to cause inflation being a continuous upward transfer of wealth.<p>Inflation is a downward transfer of current wealth (more precisely, its a transfer of wealth <i>from</i> net creditors to net debtors.)<p>Insofar as inflation has a negative direct effect on the less wealthy, its because it decreases the real value of income streams of fixed (or pegged to some index that grows slower than inflation) income streams, and the less wealthy are more likely to be dependent on such streams.<p>OTOH, inflationary currency is a big part of what makes such streams (defined benefit pensions, etc.) possible in the first place; so a deflationary currency wouldn&#x27;t actually make that situation any better.",1384909433

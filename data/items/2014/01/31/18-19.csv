Portraying it as the second coming of USSR is plain wrong. It is also wrong to assume that there are plans to turn this union into political one - Russia doesn&#x27;t need the headache of managing Ukrainian, Kazakh or any other nation&#x27;s internal affairs. To achieve that Russia is willing to spend a few bln here and there to push them in the direction of CU. Again, EU did the same thing with Eastern Europe by accepting them on a super fast track.<p>I don&#x27;t have bias, I am trying to see things as they are without cliches. EU is not likely to survive in its current form. One of the main issues with EU is that some countries made it there for political reasons, for which EU is beginning to pay dearly and has no appetite for Ukraine whatsoever.

7158409,comment,7156563,7157965,6,0,jarvic,,,"Sure, most anyone can throw some data into an SVM and get a result out, maybe even a good one.  The problem comes when someone like this has to answer questions beyond a simple 90% accuracy rate.  What does the computed separation direction tell me?  Could I improve accuracy by using some a priori information like how often one class occurs in relation to the other?  What 10% of the population am I failing on? Is it an important part? Is there some easy way I could do better?  Is my data so high dimensional that I&#x27;m getting some trivial separation and not anything driven by the data itself?<p>And what happens when this person gets a new data set and they are suddenly getting garbage out of some standard SVM?  Is it just a matter of the data not being well-separated using a linear model but throwing some simple kernel at the SVM will do the trick?<p>Even something as simple as taking a mean can fall apart when you are dealing with data which doesn&#x27;t live in a Euclidean space, let alone something like PCA or SVM which also make assumptions of linearity.<p>The point is, it isn&#x27;t just about being able to invent new methods.  Things like SVM make assumptions about your data and applying them in cases when these assumptions don&#x27;t hold can give completely worthless information, even if it looks good on the surface.  Using something you don&#x27;t understand, even if it is at a (much) more basic level than someone with a PhD in statistics, is just asking for trouble.",1391194508

Knowing history of the country is crucial here. \nIf you look at the Russian Imperial Census of 1897 you will see that people living in the eastern part of modern Ukraine were 80-90% ukrainian speaking.

But in the meanwhile go get your girl a bath [girl meaning your daughter, around 10 to 13 years old] because I will be taking her for several days&#x27; and then they would not return her to you until she was pregnant. THAT was the reason the situation exploted in Tepalcatepec&quot;.<p>Some minutes before, at 4:28 he explains why he joined the movement. He says that in the month of December only (of 2012 I believe) 14 girls between the ages of 10 and 11 were raped. And all this on top of things like, for every cow that you sell, you had to pay X amount of pesos to the cartels. For every kilo of tortilla, same thing. Basically it was a form of cartel taxes. The thing is he says that even when they had that extorsion thing going on, things were relatively &quot;in peace&quot;, meaning that executions and such were just happening between cartel members, and not with the civilian population. And then he explains the quote above, of what made everything blow to pieces...<p>Now, this Mireles guy is just the leader of the groups in one of the municipalities, namely Tepalcatepec. But other groups are already active from other places as well. Also, you have to take into account that, at least Tepalcatepec, in 2005, it had around 22,000 people.

Many countries still use the state-run monopoly. Connecting to them has a specific price. The demand for calls into their country is more-or-less fixed, and will remain so no matter the price. If you&#x27;re seeing a price much below the actual price, then it&#x27;s due to someone doing some illegal maneuver, such as sticking their cell phone on a VoIP system. (Despite it being illegal, I applaud such efforts.) Even for countries that aren&#x27;t run like that (Europe?), prices can be well in excess of $0.20 a minute. The price to the receiver of the call is $0.00 so perhaps that limits competition. Some places even put an international tax on all calls, so that calls from outside the area are forced to pay more. Some places do the inverse.<p>Do you have info on people that use SMS across countries? For many countries I&#x27;ve seen, the price-per-message makes it a true last resort. (Inside the US or inside EU, this may not be an issue.) This makes WhatsApp so useful.<p>Do you have a real proposal, or is this a &quot;it&#x27;d be nice if our government helped some companies build and run an IM infrastructure for very low cost for us&quot;?",1391192677

In the web you don&#x27;t have pages, it&#x27;s evolved to be seamless and scrollable. Natuarally, LaTeX was not designed for such an environment.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that LaTeX is worthless on the web. The gluing algorithms that Knuth used for creating sentences and paragraphs do (for the most part) work, even in documents without pages. In all honesty, the web could benefit greatly from LaTeX, pagination aside.<p>I&#x27;m glad that the author seems to have a practical perspective on this:\n>We think LaTeX is still the best programming language to tell a computer how to place text on a page. But the TeX project started pre-web, in 1978, and its scope and function are tightly linked to the printed page, not the webpage.<p>He goes on to give an example of constructing a table in LaTex which requires (or assumes by default) a suggested location for LaTeX to place the table in the page; something which is currently nonsensical in all but a few web environments. Like the author, I also find CSS appealing for a potential &quot;LaTeX&quot; on the web solution.<p>However, LaTeX was designed from the very first to be the next standard in type setting and is a turing complete language. CSS is still under debate for being turing complete, and it lacks nearly all of the features that are iconic of LaTeX, except for the ability to format math equations ( and even then...).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the next standard in typesetting will be, but it will be designed to be device agnostic (with book existing as a supported format), it will target the web and similar digital media, it will be turing complete, and it will be created specifically to fulfill each of those goals, not to have them retroactively attached in a ham-fisted way.",1391192460

For example, perfect use of a hormonal pill means that you take it every single day, at the same time, without ever forgetting; perfect use of condoms means that you use a condom every time you have sex, before beginning sex, that you put it on correctly and that you stop immediately if it breaks; et cetera. Even the much-lambasted &quot;withdrawal&quot; and rhythm methods have really quite good efficacy, assuming you implement them perfectly.[0]<p>Of course, people aren&#x27;t robots, especially when it comes to sex, and that&#x27;s why we have typical-use statistics that reflect the reality of the situation: People forget to take the pill, or take it at the wrong time. People skip using the condom, just this once-- and <i>forget</i> about &quot;pulling out&quot;. And people who were abstaining, well, <i>don&#x27;t</i>.<p>It may be the case, if we ignore certain unpleasant factors, that abstinence, done perfectly, has 100% efficacy for preventing pregnancy. But we need only to glance at the statistics to see that, in the real world, held to the standard we hold any other procedure to, it is the very worst form of birth control anyone has come up with yet.

7158082,comment,7157779,7157779,4,0,cryoshon,,,"Where is this guy getting his numbers? From wikipedia[1]: 2011 had a pre-tax Gini coefficient of 0.477 whereas 1967 had 0.397 (the first year the Gini was actually measured), demonstrating considerable increase in inequality.<p>There&#x27;s an Economist article[2] that puts the US&#x27;s pre-tax Gini at 0.57 for 2013.<p>So yeah, income inequality has increased astronomically, undeniably, conclusively. The author seems to write off income inequality as a metric because it &quot;doesn&#x27;t track societal progress&quot; and &quot;isn&#x27;t helpful for policy making purposes&quot; both of which I would strongly reject.<p>First, let&#x27;s explicitly state the axiom that money is equal to political and social power. An increasing Gini means we&#x27;re moving farther and farther away from an equitable society and closer to feudalism or a plutocracy where the richest control everything via their ability to manipulate the political process with money. I think that it&#x27;s fairly clear that our current government has been repeatedly bought, sold, and manipulated by a few plutocrats with special interests for the sake of making them and their buddies even more money. If you&#x27;re looking for an example to support this argument, consider the billionaire Koch brothers and their political empire.<p>Next, let&#x27;s consider what a rising Gini means for policy making purposes. If you are a policymaker whose primary constituents are the rich, a rising Gini is a stat which you can bring out at your fundraisers (a bit ridiculous, sure) to show that you&#x27;re on average channeling wealth into the right pockets with your policies. On the flip side (and more realistic side), if you&#x27;re an Elizabeth Warren type, you can connect your constituent&#x27;s cries for a stronger safety net to a statistic which proves they&#x27;re not just perpetually hungry for more. If you bring a piece of information like a Gini to the public, it&#x27;s possible to win over people who may have been skeptical about supporting stronger social programs because they&#x27;re unwilling to support &quot;deadbeats&quot; or the like-- after all, this Gini thing says that even if they&#x27;re productive members of society, they&#x27;re still not as well off as before. Their piece of the pie has actually become smaller over time, and their complaints are not baseless.<p>That said, I like the author&#x27;s plug for basic income. The sooner we chop up the concept of capitalism and move on to a more just system, the sooner we&#x27;ll unlock the underclass from the survival grind and free them to pursue more socially useful ends.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/11/inequality-america"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/11/in...</a>",1391191837

I think what makes this difficult is that it is hard to come up with a formula - so much of it is a &quot;feel&quot; that you develop over years of doing it.<p>Also, in tech we often account for the development time but not as much the time for everything else. Even though segment.io took you two days to build the MVP, I have a feeling it took you many, many more &quot;passive&quot; hours of thinking about the problem(may be even before you decided to turn it into a startup). When you take that into account the time you spent experiencing the problem and thinking through the various solutions, the MVP took you a lot more than 2 days to build.<p>One of my most successful projects took me barely a day to code. But it was a painpoint that I experienced and thought about pretty much every week of my undergrad. But for some reason, I did not feel I was in a position to attack the problem until a very particular moment.

Unless you go to Starbucks wearing a ski-mask, a Faraday cage, and paying with cash you are possibly being tracked for marketing data. As much as I have an natural dislike against rampant corporate abuse, I am hard pressed to find a reason a privately owned merchant couldn&#x27;t put one of these in their store. When I go to a hockey game I get my ticket checked, my ID checked, I have to empty my pockets, possibly even my bag, and I have to get scanned by a metal detector. But that is something I consent to so that I may go about enjoying the game. I feel as though eventually these types of Mac address scanners, loyalty cards, credit card tracking, and things of the like will just be terms that the stores set that we just sacrifice to be able to shop there.

7306778,comment,7304488,7305339,1,0,ptmx,,,"This sounds fine in the abstract, but I&#x27;m suspicious of it in practice because it&#x27;s hard to make an honest evaluation of your willingness to pay for these goods when you have the easy option of getting them for free. I see many people using this argument while at the same time paying for other leisure goods that I suspect they actually value less than, say, music. The difference is that these other leisure goods really do have a pay-or-abstain dynamic imposed by reality. Reality keeps you honest about how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for those goods, whereas with music you can consume the good without paying for it and never confront the decision of paying or abstaining from it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply to you specifically, since it&#x27;s dependent on your financial situation and how much you consume various media. Imagine yourself in a hypothetical world where it wasn&#x27;t physically possible to pirate any music, TV shows, movies, software, etc. Would you <i>really</i> completely abstain from enjoying those goods, or would you simply reduce your consumption while actually paying for it?

With America, this is a drastic problem, as after the period of the 50&#x27;s to 80&#x27;s, perceptually, there is little room to go, except down.  Compared to other nations, our relative delta was larger than anywhere else, and compared favourably to the deltas of the British Empire, Rome, ect...<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that America is a nation populated by people with a strong streak of individualism, to the point where even national identity can be difficult.  When folks are in Texas (example only for oil) and actively resist trade benefits for folks in say, North Dakota, then talking about the benefits of free trade for society as a whole is a non-starter.

This affected their stance on investigation urgency, thoroughness and possible contingency actions. They decided to conduct a parametric &quot;what-if&quot; scenario study more suited to determine risk probabilities of future events, instead of inspecting and assessing the actual damage. The investigation report in particular singled out NASA manager Linda Ham for exhibiting this attitude. In 2013, Hale recalled that Director of Mission Operations John Harpold told him before Columbia&#x27;s destruction:<p>&quot;You know, there is nothing we can do about damage to the TPS [Thermal Protection System]. If it has been damaged it&#x27;s probably better not to know. I think the crew would rather not know. Don&#x27;t you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit, knowing that there was nothing to be done, until the air ran out?&quot;<p>Hale added, &quot;I was hard pressed to disagree [at the time]. That mindset was widespread. Astronauts agreed. So don&#x27;t blame an individual; look for the organizational factors that lead to that kind of a mindset.

The creator makes it very clear &quot;The “micro” in microframework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won’t make many decisions for you&quot;. So now that we have that out of the way, I will point some specific things from this post that do not make sense to me. May be I didn&#x27;t get the point.<p>&quot;Set up a SQLite3 / MySQL / PostgreSQL database server.&quot;<p>What do you mean here ? Should we not setup a database server ? Flask does not force you to use any specific database. In fact, personally I prefer that I can use sqlalchemy etc. without worrying about being tied to a specific ORM. That&#x27;s the point of flask for me.<p>&quot;Write a User model (and define a users table).&quot;<p>Sure. Flask wants you create your own user table. But why is that a big deal ? I mean yes most user models have username/email,pwd_hash etc. I would rather create my own model depending on my application need vs taking a pre-defined model. This is not at all difficult and again, the whole idea is that you <i>want</i> that flexibility and hence using flask.<p>&quot;Build your own login view code to create new user accounts, and store them in the database.&quot;<p>Again, I can create custom apps based on the specific requirements if I have this flexibility. But ok, I see your point. Stuff like this <i>can</i> get overwhelming. But then again, flask gives me so many tools that I am not worried. Want to do notifications/subscriptions ? boom, plug in Signals. stuff like that.<p>&quot;Implement your own crypto, usually by importing from the werkzeug library and hashing user passwords yourself.&quot;<p>Wait,what ? Who says that flask wants you to <i>implement</i> your own crypto ? You can directly use py-bcrypt or others. It is as easy as below. There is no <i>implementation</i> here.<p><pre><code>    bcrypt.hashpw(password,bcrypt.gensalt())\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Hashing user passwords when they attempt to login, then comparing these hashes to the database.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s wrong with this again ?<p>&quot;Storing custom user data either in the same database table as your accounts, or relating it via a foreign key.&quot;<p>Now it seems like you are justifying Flask-Stormpath more than the fact that we should not be doing these ?<p>&quot;Storing user data in cookies and sessions directly to handle logged-in state.&quot;<p>Ok, I agree here. Flask does make it a little harder dealing with sessions since the default is cookies for everything. But again, because flask does not want to enforce any particular datastore, it gets tricky.<p>Then, you came up with these conclusions:<p>&quot;Almost nobody hashes passwords correctly.&quot;<p>Is this a little far fetched conclusion ? I would think so. And even if people don&#x27;t hash password correctly, it is not flask authentication&#x27;s fault. It is the developer&#x27;s fault.<p>&quot;Almost nobody structures their user database to allow for scaling.&quot;<p>What do you mean by &quot;scaling&quot; ? Do you mean updating user models, adding millions of users ? What does scaling have to do with authentication ?<p>Overall, I realize that you are presenting arguments <i>for</i> Flask-Stormpath and as a flask dev, I will definitely take a look at it. But most of your arguments <i>for</i> Stormpath are not the reasons why flask has a bad authentication if there is such thing.",1393440189

C_d is around 1 for most geometries (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient</a>).<p>In the CAID report, the dimensions of the foam is estimated to be 19x11.5x11.5 inches, which is roughly 0.5x0.3x0.15 meters.  Assuming the foam fell with the smallest surface pointing down (a bad assumption), we can estimate A to be 0.045 m^2.<p>According to Wolfram Alpha, the density of air at 20km, the altitude at which the foam broke off, is 0.089 kg/m^3.  The initial velocity of the foam was about 1568 mph which is around 700 m/s.<p>Plugging all of this in to the above equation gives:<p>F ~= 981 kg*m/s^2<p>The mass of the foam was estimated at 1.6 lbs, or around 0.7 kg, and using F=ma we can calculate the acceleration to be about 1400 m/s^2.  The foam traveled for 0.16 seconds before striking the shuttle, and assuming that the above force was constant during that time (thus overestimating the change in velocity), that would result in a delta_v for the foam of 224 m/s, which is about 500 mph.<p>This is all assuming of course I didn&#x27;t make some trivial mistake with the math, which I probably did.<p>It would be great if someone with more knowledge than me could chime in about drag near the speed of sound (or multiples of the speed of sound).",1393439999

They also canceled their RISC rethink of their basic low level architecture on the day it was supposed to tape out; don&#x27;t know if it had a low enough gate count to be like the first SPARC processor, which was implemented on 2 20,000 gate arrays, one for the CPU and one for the floating point unit (gate arrays are all alike until a few layers of metal are put on top).<p>So soon enough you could run a full Common Lisp, almost certainly without as much run-time error checking, faster on cheap commodity hardware than on a Lisp Machine.<p>Something like that seems to have happened to Azul Systems, which apparently isn&#x27;t developing any new hardware, but is selling their version of the HotSpot JVM to run on x86_64 hardware.  A prior generation of their pauseless GC (vs. 1 second per GiB, a big deal if your heap is 100s of GiB) required a software write or read barrier that cost ~20% of performance (all this from memory).

7306622,comment,7305877,7306491,9,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"This is something I struggle with thinking about too as the founding designer, and generally most quality-driven person, at our company. The simplified version of the spectrum as I see it is:<p><pre><code>    1. Shipping quickly with a shitty solution.\n    2. Shipping slightly slower with a polished solution.\n    3. Shipping very slowly because minor details took over.\n</code></pre>\nThe frustrating thing is I can generally feel the difference between #1 and #2 myself, but I&#x27;m not sure how to distinguish between #1 and #2 enough to argue my point to the rest of the team. Instead I usually have to result in vague responses about quality and reputation and such, or just go into the UI or codebase and tweak things myself.<p>But on the flip side, I also know that I bring up issues that, at first glance, I think are must-haves for quality, but really aren&#x27;t. Instead the scope should be decreased not to include the feature at all. But my credibility each time I bring up something like that is diminished, rightfully so.<p>I often struggle with this when giving friends advice about their MVPs too. Everyone has gotten so wrapped up in MVPs and they equate the MVP to throwing quality out the door, but MVPs are much more about throwing away scope in my opinion. I actually think quality can actually break or break an MVP, but it&#x27;s hard to convey this properly to non-design-focused founders because they might not see the difference between certain purely-aesthetically-driven decisions and the more general and important product-quality driven decisions.<p>We built the Segment.io MVP in two days, but we did it by cutting scope, not quality. We didn&#x27;t have a settings page, a way to delete accounts, a way to reset passwords, a way to invite teammates, anything that seems like it&#x27;s necessary to work on a project. We literally had:<p><pre><code>    1. A junky home page.\n    2. A login page that literally just two inputs and a submit button.\n    3. A signup page that was similar.\n    4. *The* product page that was a glorified settings form.\n</code></pre>\nInstead we spent that time making sure the core form in the product was as helpful and simple to understand as we could make it. There was an animation that we added when turning an integration on that was completely unnecessary from an MVP standpoint, but it was one of those quality things that made it super obvious how the form worked, and added a touch of polish to the product.<p>Obviously this is completely anecdotal, so I have no idea what would have happened had we went the other way, but I do really think that some of the things we spent time getting right had an impact on our user&#x27;s perceived quality of the launch. I&#x27;m not sure how successful we would have been had we not done that.<p>There&#x27;s a really good article[1] by Ryan Singer (from 37signals) on this topic that argues that it basically boils down to scope. And we&#x27;ve found this to be really true for ourselves while working on Segment.io. Basically you go with the designer&#x27;s (or close to it) opinion on what quality should be, and the way you reduce time taken to ship a feature is to drastically cut scope. It sounds way easier than it is, but I think finding ways to cut scope is easily one of the top 5 things I&#x27;ve learned since starting the company.<p>And Ryan also has another good article[2] about how to cut down on design time by focusing on capability instead of styling. I think he&#x27;s right there, style in the early stages (while important from a first experience point of view for your users) only need to be &quot;good&quot; not &quot;great&quot;. Basically most designers can pretty easily decide on a style pretty quickly for an MVP and then execute on it, whether it&#x27;s amazing or nt. But capability should be paid more attention to because that is where things like &quot;did this solve my problem?&quot;, &quot;do I want to share this with my friends?&quot;, etc. come into play more.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that helps at all, but I&#x27;d definitely love to read more people talking about this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://feltpresence.com/articles/9-what-happens-to-user-experience-in-a-minimum-viable-product"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feltpresence.com/articles/9-what-happens-to-user-expe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://feltpresence.com/articles/18-ui-and-capability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feltpresence.com/articles/18-ui-and-capability</a>",1393439409

If you use the example of a piece of art that is going into a gallery, there is a huge difference in the advice you get at the 90% level (ie, you get color, lighting, framing, sequencing, perhaps media technicals). Whereas if you go in and get advice for your project at the 30% phase, you are likely to get feedback on the conceptualizations, themes, media choice, and perhaps even some research notes to follow up on. In other words, this is a similar distinction between what is the long-run and what is the short-run (answer: more variables are in play). So at the most extreme level of abstraction you are correct, but this post is more about understanding there are multiple levels of abstraction over which to optimize. And I do think that&#x27;s a good lesson for people who are in creative/invetive/entrepreneurial endeavors. Getting an idea to &#x27;gel&#x27; or to &#x27;crystalize&#x27; is a hugely different process than getting one &#x27;polished&#x27;.",1393439123

It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

The Nixon Administration denied Nasa the necessary budget to build the larger reusable vehicle they originally envisioned, while simultaneously scrapping the Saturn manned program.<p>As a space nut since basically I was 5 or 6 years old, when America was in its heyday of Gemini and Apollo programs (I was 10 when Apollo 11 astronauts kicked up lunar dust), space exploration was a given to me and all of my friends.<p>It was assumed that we would just keep on building and growing our space program until we got to something that resembled Clarke/Kubrick&#x27;s 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Perhaps we wouldn&#x27;t make it by 2001, but some time not too far beyond then.  Maybe 2011.  Maybe 2015.<p>It therefore makes me sad that we&#x27;ve been in this hiatus since about 1974, really 40 years of treading water rather than building much on the accomplishments of the past.  Why not a permanent station on the moon?  Why not a nuclear propulsion system that could get to Mars in 6 weeks?  What have we done instead with our money, that is so much more worthwhile?  Why was Nasa denied the $4 billion it needed to continue the Constellation program, while literally hundreds of billions were allocated for bank bailouts, automotive bailouts, etc.?  Where are our priorities?<p>I know these are controversial questions and there are probably some good answers out there, but I go back to the lost dreams, the sacrifices made by the Columbia and Challenger astronauts and others, and I wonder if we haven&#x27;t traded big dreams for little ones and lost sight along the way of what we&#x27;re all about.",1393438933

I should have included it in the first part of this series.<p>Essentially, Flask-Security is doing the same thing as Flask-Stormpath, but is a lot more flexible -- it allows you to store users however you want with Postgres, Mongo, or whatever backend database you like. It also comes with some good examples (of how to create a users table for Postgres, etc.).<p>The benefit to Flask-Stormpath is a few things:<p>- You have a pre-defined user model that is really flexible (you can do email or username login / auth).<p>- You get greater security for authentication stuff (we use a really secure digest authentication method which prevents various attacks: MITM stuff, replay attacks, timing attacks, etc.).<p>- We also provide a flexible (and scalable) key-value store for <i>all</i> your user data (up to 10mb of data, per user account, completely free), so you can do cool stuff like this:<p>>>> my_user.custom_data[&#x27;blah&#x27;] = {\n  &#x27;something&#x27;: {\n    &#x27;more_stuff&#x27;: 999.999,\n    &#x27;woot&#x27;: &#x27;hiya!&#x27;,\n  },\n}\n>>> my_user.save()<p>All your user information (and user data), is hosted, backed up, encrypted, and provided via a fast, REST API.<p>This means that you can do cool stuff like:<p>- Access your user data from many parts of your stack (without sharing databases, or doing other hacks). This is really great if you&#x27;re building a service-oriented application.<p>- Scale your userbase up from a few users to millions, no issues whatsoever.<p>And lastly, Stormpath also provides a really complete permissions model:<p>- You can encapsulate users in unique containers (directories), then map those directories to applications to make them &#x27;active&#x27;.<p>- You get out of the box email verification and password reset stuff.<p>- You can require passwords to have various levels of complexity (length, types of characters, etc.).<p>- You can put users into groups (many-to-many), which scales particularly well on our backend -- a great way to build complicated authorization hierarchies.<p>Hopefully that helps answer your questions.<p>SUMMARY: Flask-Security is probably the very best possible, purely open source, and flexible, application that exists. Flask-Stormpath is built on top of the Stormpath API, so as a benefit, can do a lot of stuff that isn&#x27;t possible for Flask-Security to do.",1393438904

But it is in the &quot;30% done stage&quot; when even a small amount of astute input can have a huge productivity benefit. There is a real art to getting something in &quot;good enough shape&quot; to be interesting for the reviewer (ie, not wasting their time), and thought through enough so that the important tensions & dynamics are able to be shown in rough-hewn relief (ie, so the analysis is also useful to you).

You only have 1000 BTC that you can sign on the exchange. If you were to generate a proof tree for that 2000 and add a branch with -1000 BTC balance at the top of the tree, everyone on the other branch would have to be provided that balance in their chain in order to get to the 1000-valued root. Any of them could clearly see that the balance was being manipulated.<p>So that won&#x27;t work. If you move the negative-balance hash down the tree, it is still visible to any user who intersects the branch on the way up.",1393437830

7306445,comment,7305877,7305877,17,0,munificent,,,"> Often times, when I seek feedback on a project, it’s not actually constructive feedback that I want; it’s simply approval.  I want a pat on the back and a “job well done.”<p>I think creative people want and need <i>both</i>. I spent a lot of my free time working on a non-fiction book[1]. I&#x27;m really aggressive about soliciting feedback: every page of the book links directly to its issue tracker on github[2].<p>I <i>love</i> critical, detailed feedback. I want my book to be great, and I can&#x27;t improve the clarity of my writing without people telling me, &quot;this was confusing&quot; or &quot;this was boring&quot;. Bug reports fill me with joy.<p>At the same time, though, the reason they fill me with joy is because they make the book better. And a big part of the reason I care about making the book better is because it means I get more approval, more email patting me on my back.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate enough to also get positive feedback, comments from people that say nothing more than &quot;You&#x27;re doing a great job!&quot; That isn&#x27;t actionable feedback, but if I didn&#x27;t hear those kinds of comments too, I wouldn&#x27;t have the motivation for the feedback that <i>is</i> actionable.<p><pre><code>    [1]: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/\n    [2]: https://github.com/munificent/game-programming-patterns/issues</code></pre>",1393437803

The only way that will end up not being legit is if you&#x27;ve double-spent the funds - that won&#x27;t happen if you&#x27;re a legit user using a regular client, and for the most part even for a nefarious user it would require significant computing resources (e.g. you&#x27;ve already mined a block spending those coins but won&#x27;t release it until you walk out of the store).<p>So the idea is that if you&#x27;re a regular retail store, accepting unconfirmed transactions is fine. Unless a big exploit becomes known, any fraud you might happen to see certianly won&#x27;t any higher than the credit card chargebacks   you&#x27;re getting now.  If you&#x27;re selling your house, you probably want to wait for a few block confirmations.<p>Not to mention there are other crypto-currencies with significantly faster block clearing times, and cryptocoin to cryptocoin exchanges are significantly easier to run than bitcoin to fiat exchanges.<p>So it really seems like all of this is only a minor inconvenience for bitcoin if anything.

There&#x27;s a committee of experts somewhere that sets prices of drugs, procedures etc, and periodically adjusts them based on technological advances, market conditions etc. This couldn&#x27;t work in the U.S. because the pricing body would be subject to intense lobbying by medical suppliers, and would quickly reflect <i>their</i> interest in keeping prices high, rather than the public interest in lower prices. (I wish I had a citation, sorry.)<p>So does that mean single-payer medical systems are impossible? No, of course not. It works fine the U.K., Canada and Taiwan to name a few. In those countries, the kind of lobbying that dominates politics in the U.S. is simply illegal.<p>At the same time, not all special-interest lobbying is harmful. Consider the case of wheel-chair users. They represent a tiny fraction of the citizenry, but they benefit greatly from a law that requires public buildings have wheel-chair access ramps. That would saddle the majority with a small cost, but the public doesn&#x27;t care either way. So the wheel-chair lobby has to put effort into getting the law passed, and it&#x27;s a good thing if it succeeds!<p>So, yes, this is a general problem that has no solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that corruption on the scale and scope that exists in the U.S. is inevitable, or that it&#x27;s not really hurting U.S. democracy. It is.",1395409932

Once the lines become so small that the dog no longer responds they have arrived at their answer.<p>What strikes me as odd is that they have taken a test designed for humans and modified it to be used for dogs. One issue with this is the fact that when a person takes a vision test they are trying very hard to discern the correct letter.

Secondly, the founder involved in the incident was put on leave, and an apology was promptly and unreservedly issued. It is easy to imagine a more hierarchical organization circling the wagons, instead. In the end, Github may be an example of serious problem with a founder that was handled as well as possible.<p>There are a lot of ways software development does not fit within traditional management structures. For example, if you take traditional project management tools and try to predict a non-trivial software development schedule with them you are going to have a bad time. So we invent new, usually less-structured tools.<p>You can&#x27;t do entirely without those structures, but minimization of hierarchy is the logical way to adapt management to the challenge of keeping software development orderly and making a business out of it, if that&#x27;s your aim.

You&#x27;re not going to find any support for async stuff like node (you&#x27;ll depend on message queues for async stuff, but frankly there are really nice options out there), and you&#x27;re not going to find anywhere near the amount of experimental projects. Django is used to solve the use cases of web developers that need to deliver.<p>I would stay away from it if you definitely need high performance or concurrency, but I have not seen many things comparable when it comes to well-engineered, pretty, and functional CRUD apps.

The first is a &quot;complex attack&quot;, which basically consists of doing things that make the server overload itself (repeatedly handshaking SSL, etc.), and that would be mitigated to some extent by reducing the complexity of the site (i.e. you can&#x27;t SSL handshake with a server that only knows HTTP). Similarly, dynamic content could be an attack surface, so static content would make it more difficult to use such a complexity attack.<p>The other type of attack, a simple bandwidth attack, doesn&#x27;t care if your server is a top-of-the-line quad-chip Xeon server or an RPi in your basement, because all it does is exploit the bottleneck that is bandwidth. This attack just pumps packets like mad in your direction, and your network will likely become congested (and eventually fail) at some level other than your server (i.e. router level, firewall can&#x27;t handle 100 Gb/s so the packets never even make it to your server).<p>So, in light of the second there, DDoS&#x27;ing static content is just as easy as DDoS&#x27;ing dynamic content sites, as long as you&#x27;re using a bandwidth type attack.<p>I encourage you to read the blog post when the site is back up, it&#x27;s definitely worth a read!<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1796-denial-of-service-attacks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1796-denial-of-service-attacks</a>",1395409086

The neutrinos for example, are much lighter than their counterparts. I guess that masses would not make sense to use since the Higgs boson is not the heaviest known particle at 125 GeV, that distinction goes to  the top quark at 173 GeV.<p>A more realistic game based 2048 and physics might be hard to make. Colliding particles does not work according to some recipe like: electron+positron makes a muon or something like that.<p>Instead there are a large number of possible recipes(Feynman diagrams) for every collision. In fact we have can have any reaction that is allowed as long as  you conserve energy, momentum, angular momentum, electric charge and a few other exotic quantities. Each of these reactions can be assigned a probability and you cannot know beforehand what the outcome of a certain reaction will be. Adapting this into a 2048-style game is not obvious.<p>A game that would actually work is adding up neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei. Having a nucleus with 2048 nucleons is of course not very realistic but if you add in the decay of unstable isotopes only reaching Uranium-238 may be hard enough.",1395408444

And maybe it is also true that it &quot;got more democratic over the past decades&quot;. But if you want to assess the state of something from a more universal and neutral perspective you should define a clear criteria and then assess how well these are satisfied.<p>If you define democracy as something where every citizen can participate equally you can easily come to the conclusion that all these countries in fact are not democracies because clearly these governments often do things that the population does not want. You can verify this easily by looking at some poll results. As soon as there are lobbyists who influence the elected representatives, there is an inequality in the power between different interest groups. This leads to less democratic societies. In our current societies not every citizen can participate equally, therefore these are not democracies. Compare it to a mathematical definition of equality... You cannot say 0.9 is equal to 1 just because it is almost equal. In a direct democracy everyone has almost equal possibilities to participate... In a representative democracy this &quot;almost&quot; get&#x27;s a little weaker. In a representative democracy with powerful lobbyist groups this &quot;almost&quot; becomes even more weak so that you cannot even call it equal anymore.<p>So I completely agree when people look at current democracies from an idealistic point of view and say that they are not really democracies. My personal opinion is that a much more ideal democratic society is actually possible with the advances in IT. Direct democratic participation could be possible using end-to-end auditable voting systems with cryptographic methods.",1395408391

For the best examples look to how political leaders talk about military conflicts. Language regarding conflict is very well chosen and quite misleading. Terms like &quot;collateral damage&quot;, &quot;area denial weaponry&quot;, &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;, &quot;enemy combatants&quot; are not exactly ironic, but they do have true meanings and implications very far from what they superficially sound like. Examples of true ironic &quot;newspeak&quot; can also be readily found. You may have heard leaders talk about various military, police, and spying agencies protecting your &quot;freedom&quot;, despite the obvious roles they have in restricting your freedom. Talk about freedom often actually means &quot;freedom to do what we want&quot;, which is, of course, the opposite of freedom.<p>To give a common example, an invasion will often be talked about by the invading power as a &quot;liberation&quot;. Yet the act of liberation by a foreign power always ends with that foreign power having significant local political influence and access to natural resources (and may involve permanent occupation).<p>Or take the &quot;war on terror&quot; for example. Superficially, a &quot;war on terror&quot; should make people LESS afraid. Yet, in practise the politicians engaged in the &quot;war on terror&quot; have actively tried to encourage fear (in order to justify granting extraordinary powers). The irony is so blatant it&#x27;s right there in the name. Being at war makes people more afraid, so declaring war on terror is automatically ironic.

212277,comment,211782,211782,0,0,mojuba,,,"Don't worry about ""Extensive support of libraries and frameworks"", you don't need it. All web sites I built, large and small, required only two additional components: the DB glue (typically mysql) and UTF support (mbstring). There may be specific situations when you might want to send https requests or use compression, but that's ok, even that is not called ""extensive libraries and frameworks"". The bottom line is, a good web site has a clean, simple source that doesn't depend on third-party code that much.",1212957336

But if someone's available and they won't mind, just asking is usually 10-100 times faster than looking it up.<p>If I didn't know much about what I was looking for (per this example), I could see myself spending a good hour trying to find an answer, vs. the few minutes it took to get one here.<p>That's what colleagues are for!",1212956490

212262,comment,211630,212245,0,0,nostrademons,,,"$.map has an interesting quirk in its spec: it flattens returned arrays into the result.  This was implemented by calling concat() with each result, but concat creates a new array for its return value.  So each iteration was creating a new array and copying over the previous values, which makes for a quadratic runtime in most JS runtimes.<p>(Curiously, in the benchmarks folks did in the Reddit thread, it looked like Firefox was <i>not</i> quadratic - which implies that Firefox either has some clever optimizations going on or does crazy things with concat().)",1212955586

Just bookend the review with stuff like ""This is a very important topic that deserves rigorous scrutiny"" and ""I fear the authors' failure to address the points listed above weakens their conclusions."" This kinds of reviews are actually the most incisive, because it means the reviewer cared enough to really reason through your arguments and find the flaws in them.",1262581175

Like I said in my main post, I'm more like 37signals. I'm providing a service to the people who produce the stuff for the end user. Except in my case I'm also trying to slot in a great user experience for the end-user.<p>Amazon's CreateSpace has a 20-minute length minimum. So unless the Yoga videos are each longer than 20 minutes, this would be a barrier. On top of that I'm pretty sure Amazon takes a 50% cut, and their videos can't be downloaded to a mac because of DRM restrictions.<p>This is in fact an example of an area I'm trying to improve. You'll get great distribution platforms, but they're bottlenecked by a lackluster post-sale customer experience. So while the mechanism is there for someone to sell a video on a generic site, the mechanism is clogged up with gunk.<p>So I believe there was a misunderstanding. I'm not creating a marketplace. Not yet at least. So marketing is not my concern. I'm only trying to provide the tools to sell online, make marketing online easier, and a platform that will encourage people to purchase without being tied down to proprietary DRM. I also want to tailor this tool specifically to independent filmmakers.
A publisher will create a film, but after they finish it, they're going to want to find a way to get it seen and probably make a return on it. This is where my service steps in. I will provide them an alternative to their current options, and I will provide the alternative via the internet. Already I have several advantages over traditional physical distribution: instant gratification, less overhead from packaging and using a distributor, easier to market because word of mouth spreads at electron speed. And if after all that work creating something and they can't find a traditional distributor, they still have to get it out there somehow. I want to catch those potential customers.",1262578293

8269,comment,8236,8259,0,0,damien,,,"A primary key is really just the combination of the unique and not-null constraints. My preferred way of handling this is to have a surrogate key as the primary key (for performance and general ease-of-use), but also apply multi-column unique constraints on the natural key to enforce data integrity. The main place where I don't use a surrogate key is for many-to-many join tables (which I think is the common practice).",1175536736

And if you follow the link to DHH's site, you see many people in the comments talking about their apps that need offline support; companies working with Australian ag businesses, for example.<p>Another thing might be 30Boxes or whatever favorite calendar app you have. Sure, you can sync the feed to iCal, but you can't do everything off a feed.",1175536351

(this goes for multi-column keys too..)<p>I have found myself many times with my laptop in my car but unable to check my work's webmail to double check my calender because I'm offline.<p>Just to expand a bit I think its necessary for anyone building a webapp to look at how and why people need to access their app and develop accordingly.<p>",1175535892
8264,comment,8236,8236,0,0,felipe,,,"I think people in general are missing the point about rich-client web-apps. It is <i>NOT</i> about offline access, but about leveraging web-app skills (HTML, Javascript) to access hardware resources that otherwise would be blocked by the browser.<p>Web-based apps and RIA are here to stay, but there's still space for client-side apps. Example: Skype and iTunes.",1175535690

8253,comment,8205,8205,0,0,Benja,,,"The ""test case"" of DRM-free stuff that I'm most familiar with is Baen Books, who are selling DRM-free e-book versions of (almost) all their titles and -- according to themselves and their authors who are also have books published by other publishers -- ""[earn] more income as a publisher and [pay their] authors more in the way of royalty payments from [their e-book line] than any other outlet for electronic books."" Based on this, it seems likely to me that the EMI/iTunes experiment is going to deliver on its promise of making more money for EMI.<p><a href=""http://preview.baens-universe.com/articles/auged"">http://preview.baens-universe.com/articles/auged</a>\n<a href=""http://preview.baens-universe.com/articles/salvos6"">http://preview.baens-universe.com/articles/salvos6</a><p>Of course, it's a different medium, and Baen has also managed to create a community of users who like the company, not just its products. I don't see EMI replicating that, DRM-free music or no, which limits the applicability of the example. (The Baen people love telling the story of their users saying, ""you should charge more for this."" They created a premium version where you pay more to read an advance copy of the book before the official release date, and they're making money from that, too.)",1175534388

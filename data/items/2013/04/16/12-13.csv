It draws a strange set of conclusions.<p>Facebook is unattractive to a lot of people for being intrusive, for containing a lot of junk content, and for exposing how much one's friends waste time on terrible casual games.<p>But Facebook Home is the harbinger of a new and vastly more ambitious kind of mobile software systems, and Android is the platform for these more powerful systems. Just because the subject matter is vapid, and the first version imperfect (WHY will it not install on my Nexus 4??), doesn't mean it's not very important to the future of mobile software.<p>Android is flexible for a reason, and has benefitted from flexibility. This blogger apparently thinks Amazon Kindle Fire is some betrayal of Android. It is, however, highly compatible with Android applications at Kindle Fire's API level and lower. Kindle Fire also prevented Apple running away with the tablet business before Google was ready.",1366117110

5557732,comment,5557171,5557171,6,0,shubb,,,"One thing I've noticed about large organizations is that they pay more. Pay is set in a structured way with regular pay rises, so you can just sit tight and watch it rise.<p>Additionally, you can move around without leaving the company. Why is that important? Check the graph from the long term unemployment article[1]. Personally, I like to move every 2 years, so that's kind of important.<p>I'm going to write about something of personal interest now. Downvote away. It's a bit UK specific.<p>Something I've noticed, looking at the people I graduated with 8 years ago, is that the ones who have done well went to work for large companies. They did a grad scheme, stayed in the role after it had finished, and just sat tight, maybe moving a couple of times within the company.<p>They earn a multiple of those that didn't - the PHDs, sure that's expected, but also much more than the freelancers and those who have hopped between small programming houses. Certainly more than people who did something fashionable, like fashion, the arts, or teaching English abroad.<p>The funny thing is that those left behind don't have an opportunity to get on that gravy train now. Grad programs are for recent graduates. Experienced hires from companies the recruiter has heard of get first place.<p>Another effect (an this is UK specific) has been in mortgages. Since 2008, you need to save maybe 70k dollars in order to get one. That's a full years pay for a software engineer. 4 if you count tax. But rents are double or triple mortgage interest, so unless you already have one, you won't save that.<p>So we have this widening wealth gap between those who got onto, and stayed in, a graduate program 2008, and the rest. It will really be quite something in future.<p>The BBC did some analysis where they collected data about the population (wealth, cultural signifier), and clustered it. They found 7 distinct clusters, and decided to invent a new 'social class', called 'emergent service workers'. This turned out to mean 'young people who graduated since 2008'. I suspect they will be a generation of lifetime renters, doing similar jobs for a little less money than their peers 2 years older (starting salary has a compounded effect, and is suppressed by maybe 1/4 right now).<p>I don't really see this in the press. As usual, they don't notice things.<p>We live as ever in interesting times.<p>[1]<a href=""http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/LongTermUnemploymentChurn.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/LongTer...</a>\n[2] www.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/class",1366116377

5557715,comment,5551771,5557283,1,0,gordaco,,,"Good question. It depends on the field, I guess.<p>In academia there are a lot of ad hoc scientific simulations, and yes, many people still prefer C++ over Matlab, R or Numpy (because of speed or because they feel more comfortable with it). In those cases, you'll write a few medium-sized programs from scratch, and will probably be free to use the new features.<p>In videogames you will likely develop new code over an existing engine, which means that C++11 may be available, but the engine will probably be written in an older version of C++, and C++11 maybe won't be allowed during engine maintenance.<p>When maintaining big ancient systems, which are all over the place, chances are that you will be restricted to C++03 or maybe an even older version, but it's not the only possibility, so you may get lucky.<p>In any case, C++11-ready compilers should accept C++98 and C++03 code, so there is always the option of starting to use modern compilers, and when every potential problem is solved, you can use the C++11 features. Just hope your boss is not too averse to changes, and keep in mind that mixing modern style C++ with older style may result in poorly readable code.<p>As for web development, well, there actually exist a few people using C or C++, but the only languages from the C family you're likely to find on a web server are Java and C#, and they're less and less prevalent nowadays. You're more likely to find PHP, Python or Ruby. In the client you're obviously restricted to javascript, but beware: despite the syntax, it's very different from the C family. If you want to learn javascript, that surely won't hurt, just keep in mind that it carries a few paradigm changes (lack of static typing, object modeling and inheritance through prototypes, and A LOT of quirks about the syntax).",1366116076

Better info would be appreciated.  Anyway the best I could find was two claims:<p>There were 11 million american victims of identity theft in 2011 (outta 400 million) for a ratio of about 1 in 40 of the general population gets p0wned per year.  Obviously not all ID theft is CC theft but I'd guess a lot of it is.  Based on friends and family experience getting a CC number stolen every four decades of use passes the smell test so I will go with that.<p>A quote from prweb.com found by google: ""Started in 2003, Linode has grown to over 45,000 customers"".  I wonder what year that quote is from.  Still ""forty five thousand"" is probably not totally ridiculous.  It makes sense looking at their hostname scheme, ip space allocations as per whois, and some educated guesses.  Lots of people including myself like linode.<p>So assuming the average linode customer is the same as the average joe6pack then 45000/40/365 = about 3 linode customers should get p0wned per day regardless of any linode problem.  To make my inner EE happy I'll call the ""noise level"" about 3/day and evaluate the SNR based on that noise level to see if there's a signal of p0wnership.<p>Obviously the two reports over the course of a couple days is not 100% of all linode customers who got p0wned.  But it does show that two reports doesn't really prove anything.<p>Now, as a made up example, 900 reports over 3 days would be a HUGE indicator ""something"" happened.  But at a predicted noise level of about ten or so over three days, two reported is down there in or below the noise.  So, as a long term linode customer I'm not freaking out (yet).

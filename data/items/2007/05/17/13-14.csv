22777,comment,22726,22726,0,0,vlad,,,"With Friendster, they got progressively more complicated the more users they got.  On the other hand, MySpace was able to grow without any problems because they had a much simpler setup.<p>The question to ask is whether a competitor can do something better.  I don't use twitter, but it sounds like any competitor would also have to be doing a similar number of database queries.<p>So, any competitor would still have to go through what twitter has, so twitter is still ahead by now focusing on the scalability.<p>Twitter has to move people to a non-rails platform as soon as possible.  The whole point of rails or visual basic 6 is to develop a prototype really quickly and change your ideas to find the one that works.  If the problem now is the speed, just pretend you're a competitor and do what the competitor would do in your situation.  A competitor wouldn't be recreating the failed versions of Twitter; they would just copy the current idea in C or whatever the fastest method is, since the business idea and execution is more valuable now than flexibility, now that the business idea has been discovered and twitter doesn't have to spend time making so much changes.  Except, Visual Basic 6 programs are very fast on modern computers, and they run on each user's computer separately, so you wouldn't want to rewrite them for Windows if it already exists and works.",1179409320
22776,comment,22669,22716,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's a good example of how to handle a PR crisis.  If your site gets popular enough, you <i>will</i> face one.  The natural reaction of an executive is usually one of two:<p>1.) Ignore the problem, eg. Intel with the Pentium bug.<p>2.) Blame the user, eg. most customer service reps nowadays.<p>Stewart didn't do either of these - he took full responsiblility, explained why the action was taken (no matter how misguided), and enacted policies to prevent it from happening again.  And you can see that the result is even more customer loyalty.<p>We had several of these crises situations when I was at FictionAlley.  They're much more difficult to handle than they seem from the outside, because there are always considerations that your users don't see (legal issues, other constituencies, privacy considerations).  Users really appreciate you being honest with them, though, and if you make a good-faith effort to communicate what you can without defensiveness, you'll usually get their understanding if not their support.<p>Also, a random observation - these crises <i>always</i> seem to occur when the people in charge are away.  I remember having one erupt right after my laptop had died and having to deal with it all from the university computer labs, and then another blew up while the site owner was returning from her brother-in-law's funeral.",1179409155

22772,comment,22699,22699,0,0,Goladus,,,"Personally I think virtual gifts is a dangerous business model.  In some scenarios it can work, but you need a really good reasons to create artificial scarcity or else you'll piss people off and be very vunerable to competition.<p>Raise your hand if paying $2 to download a 200k ringtone makes you happy.  How fast would that business model disappear if people were able to upload whatever they wanted from their PC or iPod?<p>Making money from virtual property is a great idea, but it can definitely ""go against the flow"" just like ads.  You have to be really careful to only charge for things that people will buy because they want to pay for them.",1179408868

I'm not totally sure if that kind of approach would limit you too much. I'm thinking something like the way ad blocking software has large lists of ad servers, etc.",1179408717

22767,comment,22666,22754,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Actually, Google does give employees time to work on their own ideas.  It's just that they own anything that comes out of that time.  Arguable this is just as evil, so your point stands.<p>I think the solution may be to think of your job as buying you time.  Set a baseline salary that'll let you live a simple life with adequate health & safety.  For a single guy, that's about $20K/year (= grad student wages); for a married guy with a couple kids, about $40K.  If that seems low, remember that 50% of America lives on that.<p>Then take the difference between your actual salary and your cost of living, and think of it as time.  For example, if you graduate with a $60K/year job, set aside 2/3 of your salary as savings, and every hour you work is buying you 2 hours of freedom.  When you have enough time saved up to accomplish what you want, quit and ""spend"" it.  <p>For example, I'm currently saving about 2 hours of time for every hour I work.  I'm looking to quit after slightly more than 2 years at my job (that'll be another 6 months or so), at which point I'll have 4-5 years saved up.<p>I met an innkeeper in Alaska who followed this strategy.  He and his wife decided when they got out of college that they'd live like grad students.  They worked in the computer field.  After 15 years, they each quit their jobs, bought a sailboat, and sailed around the world with their son, stopping at every port they came into.  They finally settled in Seward, Alaska (pop. 3000), bought an old building, and fixed it up as an inn.",1179408372

That said, the poster is absolutely right, this model is making money hand over fist.  For many of these sites, VCs are superfluous. Even Angels are superfluous!<p>I still say that the first kid to come out with a FULLY hardware accelerated 3D game world in the browser WITHOUT security warnings or downloaded plugins will be very rich indeed.",1179408340

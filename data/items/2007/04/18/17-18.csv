14159,comment,14095,14120,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Take a careful look at the number they're measuring.  They say that only 0.2% of <i>visits</i> to Flickr are uploads.<p>That's very different from saying that only 0.2% of <i>users</i> upload content.  Even someone who regularly uploads photos to Flickr probably views 10 photos for every one they upload.  Think about news.YC: in a typical day, I probably post 3-4 comments and submit one article, yet I read about two dozen articles and 50+ comments.  And I'm #13 on the leader list, so most people would probably consider me a participant.<p>IMHO, the article chose a very meaningless number and then reported it as a big find.  Reads <i>always</i> outnumber writes, by a large margin.  Your top contributors don't just post things, they're also usually voracious consumers, probably reading dozens of items for every one they submit.<p>It's like saying that novelists read 100 books for every one that they write, and therefore they aren't really contributing anything to literature.",1176919048

The ratio of Steven Spielberg to everyone who sees his movies is pretty low, for example.  I don't think that's a problem.<p>Only 0.2% of users upload photos to flikr, probably because the number of lurkers has skyrocketed.

14130,comment,14095,14095,0,0,timg,,,"No kidding. As much as some people around here hate to hear it, sometimes you have to FORCE your users <i>provide</i> content before they can <i>receive</i> their fill of content from your app. What are the benefits/costs of each approach?<p>Allowing users to receive without giving content:<p>1. Good: Maximizes the impact of your PR/ Lets you grow really fast over a short period of time.<p>2. Bad: Easy come, easy go. Since the users have no role as a content creator, they will be out of there the second your competitor has the slightest feature improvements over you.<p>Requiring every user to be a creator (edit- to receive full benefit from your app):<p>1. Bad: The start can be rough. Expect to have to really have to use some marketing ingenuity.<p>2. Good: Users will be locked in.<p>3. Good: Your site will (should) be far more valuable if more people are contributing. This, along with #1 will lead to exponential growth.<p>4. Maybe bad: With this abundance of content, it will be mandatory that you find a way to present the user with the content that is most relevant to him.<p>5. Good: You are monopolizing access to a lot of content. You can probably charge users directly for this access.<p>Thoughts?",1176916690
14129,comment,14090,14090,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Perhaps I'm too simple-minded, but paying bloggers to talk about your site just sits wrong with me.  I thought that part of the reason blogging has become so popular is because the traditional media outlets were getting to be too influenced by money and politics, so blogs were inherently more honest and interesting.  To see some of the same practices occurring in blogs spells decline in my opinion; if enough of them succumb to these mechanisms, blogging will lose its credibility or honesty just as other media outlets have.<p></rant><p>I still thought the article had some good suggestions, and I'll be sure to keep it in mind when launching my own site.\n",1176916170
14128,comment,13968,13968,0,0,geebee,,,"Would most founders be interested in finding programmers through the traditional job posting/resume/interview process?  I'm thinking that to get a crack at working with really excellent programmers and founders, you probably need to be connected through a network and known a bit by reputation.  No, you don't have to be famous, just respected and known by a group of good peers.  <p>I take a particular interst in this question because I'm working on a project (that doesn't deserve to be called a startup, but maybe it could be), and I need someone with kick-ass UI design and graphics skills (I wrote the backend myself, but it looks lame).  I'll go through my blurred social/professional networks to see who would be into it.  <p>Then again, I'm just looking for someone I already know and like who would dig the project and maybe want to make something of it.  An actual job job, the kind that pays money, can probably afford to be more formal about this sort of thing.  But would you want to be?  Seems safer to go through those blurry networks at an early stage, where one bad programmer can drag everything down. and one good one can rev it up fast.  <p>\n",1176916125

Opera Mobile/Mini and the S60 browser both do a solid job of rendering regular XHTML web pages for many months, yet there hasn't exactly been an explosion in Mobile Web 2.0 content (or microcontent).",1176915861

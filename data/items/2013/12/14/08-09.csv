They can make solid choices. They know what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s not, and fiction doesn&#x27;t hurt them no more than it does any adult. Children are hungry for knowledge, and when gained it is exactly what makes people more resilient against what you fear.<p>On topic, CoD is not made for children. It&#x27;s made for adults. But if a child was exposed to it and they understood it was all pretend do you think they would be in any way damaged? If they understood that in reality it&#x27;s not okay to shoot people that playing a game would make them want to shoot people in the real world? Would they think it was okay to shoot Russians?

Which was everything, and it makes me roll my eyes now what they thought would turn me away from their god. This is why I hold so much disdain for people who are so worried about kids being exposed to crap. Let the kids decide if it&#x27;s crap or not. Talk with them about why they like it or not. If something concerns you about what they are interested in, talk with them to make sure they understand what is and isn&#x27;t real, what is acceptable in the real world and what isn&#x27;t. If they know what&#x27;s real and what isn&#x27;t why should they fear? Why should they be damaged in any way?",1387009115

In Europe, this is London. I see 20+ jobs being posted every week for senior C++ developers. I&#x27;m guessing Wall Street will have similar requirements. Game development is also an option, but at your age/experience, I don&#x27;t recommend that industry.\nOf course there are other companies that require C++, my last job was making a portable (Mac, Linux, Windows, iOS and Android) music streaming library with custom DRM. You will find these &#x27;odd&#x27; jobs with C++ requirements less frequently but can be a good option.<p>So, that&#x27;s C++. Now about focusing on something else. It really depends on your goals/life. If you prefer a startup type company, then yes, node.js/ruby/Python are your best bets to get a job at those (doesn&#x27;t mean Haskell or Scala won&#x27;t get you a job) but if you prefer a more enterprise company (which there is nothing wrong, I do, since I have a small boy at home and really value the work/life balance I get) you should probably focus on either Java or C#. There are tons of jobs around for these technologies (in Europe, C# seems more in demand than Java, no idea on your location).<p>If you want, you can also always learn Obj-C or Java(Android). Mobile developers seem to be in hot demand right now and it can be something completely different from what you are used to do (which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about learning)<p>Technologies aside, if your 10 years experience really brought you to Senior level (I&#x27;ve met folks that seemed to have just repeated the same year 10 times) I don&#x27;t think you will have a problem finding a Senior role in whatever tech you choose. I started with C, moved to C++, then C#, Ruby/Rails, Obj-C. Even though I don&#x27;t have 10 years experience with each of those, I easily found a job for senior developer (actually, I got a few interviews and got offers from all, from Sony to a big financial firm in London and small start upsas well.)<p>If you have any questions or just want to chat about your situation, shoot me an email (email on profile).",1379058456

In order for one club to stop being racist, <i>all</i> of them have to so white patrons just have to deal with being around (shock horror) black people. It just takes one to waive from this policy, and there isn&#x27;t a huge amount of motivation to stick to it. So, govm&#x27;t has to stick it&#x27;s nose in and make sure bouncers aren&#x27;t being racist (fairly easy, just send sober black people in who are 100% conforming to the dress code and see if they get refused), and fine them massively if they are guilty, thus de-incentivising racism.

If you start to let yourself get distracted daily, you&#x27;ll build bad habits that prevent you from staying on task. I know cause I&#x27;ve been there before.<p>For the 2nd point, expectations can be a HUGE obstacle especially when they go unfulfilled. People who are only working on something because of where it will take them and not enjoying the work at the moment, I think, have a very difficult time staying motivated on the task. Because if the expectation isn&#x27;t coming, then it becomes harder and harder to stick with something.<p>I&#x27;ve put together a course to try to address these points and others that I see programmers commonly having a difficult time with.

I worked in investment banking in NY and SF before moving over to VC/growth equity (and now a hedge fund).<p>Not only are bankers by definition terrible managers, but there&#x27;s absolutely zero incentive for them to try to treat the junior people below them well.  Junior people&#x27;s time is viewed as an consumable resource like an oil well or a coal seam.<p>As a result, the sort of &quot;pizza-sized team&quot; project management that is the heartbeat of software companies is just a total unknown on the corporate finance/M&A side of investment banks.  (Less so in consulting.)<p>Worse, there is no concern for what we used to call &quot;yield loss:&quot; slides or analyses that we&#x27;d create because a senior banker demanded them that were never presented to the client or in which they client had no interest.  Countless times I&#x27;ve been the creator of and recipient of extensive presentations of which maybe one slide was relevant.  I recall numerous instances of sending such books by messenger or FedEx to hotels/partners&#x27; houses, only to learn that they were never even picked up, let alone looked at.<p>As a VC/private equity guy, the presentations and investment memos that were no doubt largely written between 2 and 5 AM were mostly discarded; I extracted the few numbers I needed and tossed them, as I wanted the raw data from management and not the bankers&#x27; glossy sales pitch.  I had stacks of these things in my office.<p>I&#x27;m not of the opinion that investment banking adds no value.  But I firmly believe that the culture and habits of investment banks result in piles of unnecessary work that just burns out everyone associated with the enterprise and is not in any meaningful way related to the quality or value of the service delivered.<p>Clients don&#x27;t care how many hours you worked, they care about the end results.<p>(I make exception here for situations with real economic deadlines like M&A auctions, but the biggest issues are not usually financial--they&#x27;re business issues that bankers don&#x27;t actually help much with compared to strategy consultants--I was one of those for a summer too, and the hours were long but reasonable.)",1379057211

Use a burner phone and leave your iPhone in your lair. The paranoia in this tread is bordering on pathological. If you did commit a crime then a lack of fingerprint scanner isn&#x27;t going to help you much. If you didn&#x27;t commit the crime but happened to be there, then perhaps cooperating with the police to catch the real perpetrator would preclude being forced to scan your finger to prove something that you&#x27;ve already claimed when cooperating with the police to solve such a heinous crime, whatever that crime might be.<p>For the average non-criminal, the likelihood of ever being both falsely accused and falsely convicted based on evidence from an iPhone is almost infinitesimally small. Considering that if you didn&#x27;t do the crime, if anything the phone should exonerate you.<p>The fairly rare cases of something &#x27;bad&#x27; happening and getting falsely accused shouldn&#x27;t be the basis of making tech decisions. A similar logic would compel us to never ride in a car, since the threat profile of an auto fatality is much higher than that of being forced to incriminate yourself with an iPhone. Decisions should be based on a risk management profile. If you tend to hang out with criminals, then your risk management profile would be different than someone who works at home and only goes to the gym once in awhile. And if you are a criminal, you&#x27;d be foolish to use any identifiable electronics devices at all. Your retired aunt Sarah who hangs out at the hair salon and church food pantry would hardly need to be as paranoid as a guy who&#x27;s good friend is an ecstasy dealer.

The point is that a sizable chunk of the population can now unlock a lot of information about themselves without the fifth being an issue.

As a company, it supports an incredibly large number of countries, more than almost all companies posted here on HN, and definitely just as much if not more than most in the world.

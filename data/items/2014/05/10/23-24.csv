7727221,comment,7726842,7727168,1,0,dvdkhlng,,,"According to wikipedia [1], they planned to use their Loongson MIPS chips for some of the Dawning supercomputers, but later reconsidered.  I&#x27;d guess using Loongson MIPS didn&#x27;t make any sense given its poor performance compared to Intel CPUs.<p>It will take quite some time to get to a modern CPU design that can compete with Intel but it seems Loongson development continues even without being able to produce comptetive products for now.  For example, Lemote.com seems to be selling Loongson 3A server blades [2].  For HPC applications Loongson 3B would have much better performance due to implementing 256-bit vector instructions (maybe similar to intel AVX), I wonder whether these can be readily bought anywhere in china.  Loongson 3C would bring quite some performance boost by finally switching to a more modern process technology (28nm instead of 65nm), but google doesn&#x27;t show any results that&#x27;d indicate it&#x27;s produced already.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawning_Information_Industry#Dawning_5000L"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawning_Information_Industry#D...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.lemote.com/products/computer/hongri/346.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lemote.com/products/computer/hongri/346.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1257218"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1257218</a>",1399766306

I tried to correct it, but I use Tor.  I noticed when I tried to upvote the comments that upvotes from Tor users don&#x27;t actually register.  This makes sense, because allowing access from Tor will make it too easy to create sockpuppet accounts that game the system.  But I was wondering if I might be able to be granted an exception based on good behavior?  If it&#x27;s not possible at the software level then don&#x27;t worry about it, I understand.  It&#x27;s an unfortunate fact that Tor citizens won&#x27;t be able to fully partake in HN, but it seems like that&#x27;s the price of anonymity (and it seems like a reasonable one too!)<p>I was also wanting to check with you: has Tor caused the mod team many problems?  I&#x27;m hoping that by setting a good example, I can convince others that it&#x27;s possible to allow strong anonymity to good effect in a community.  So I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that Tor will continue to be allowed on HN. (Thank you from the bottom of my heart for resisting the urge to ban it from the start.)",1399765996

What’s really remarkable to me is that ISPs don’t seem to understand this, and by killing net neutrality they are hastening the demise of their own business model.<p>It’s going to be a little rough for 5-10 years, but when everyone’s cell phone has p2p gigabit wifi, I find it a little hard to imagine that ISPs will even exist as a business, outside of the government or things like banking where a hard line/low latency is desirable.

All the list has is the abstracts from the patents. A patent abstract is kind of like the blurb on the back of a book, or a trailer for a movie. They give you an overview of what the patent covers, but there will be innumerable ways to accomplish what the abstract describes without infringing the patent.<p>When you are looking at a list of patents to figure out if you might be infringing one of them, or to figure out if one of them describes a solution to a problem you are trying to find a solution for, the abstract is more of a tool for telling you which patents you can skip rather than what ones you need to take a deeper look at.<p>To see what the patent actually covers, you have to read the claims. However, the claims are interpreted in light of the specification, so you have to read that, too. A claim may appear to be quite broad, but the discussion in the specification might limit general terms in the claim to very specific values or meanings. In most cases, a patent is not something you can just sit down and quickly understand, even if you are an expert in the field the patent is in.<p>Even this is not always enough. You should also read the &quot;file wrapper&quot; for the patent. That&#x27;s the collection of documentation generated during the processing of the patent application. It will include things like the examiner&#x27;s prior art search results, initial rejections of claims, the letters from the application trying to persuade the examiner to change their mind about rejected claims, answers to questions from the examiner, and stuff like that. You can get the file wrapper online through the &quot;Patent Application Information Retrieval&quot; (PAIR) interface [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair</a>",1399765070

If you do that by paying a transit provider then obviously the transit provider will have to supply the amount of capacity you&#x27;re paying them to get and they&#x27;ll charge you accordingly.<p>> Also, it&#x27;s not like there is discrimination right now, how many domestic access providers allow outbound access on port 25, or multicast, or BGP?<p>Blocking port 25 by default is an anti-spam measure. In general if you call your ISP and ask them to unblock it, they will. They&#x27;re not blocking it because they don&#x27;t want you use it, they&#x27;re blocking it because you want them to.

But notice, it&#x27;s still a problem, even though you can only get antibiotics with prescription. This is mostly due to the fact that many doctors, and most veterinarians I have ever had the displeasure of meeting are woefully incompetent. I am 30, and used antibiotics twice in my life, and needed it twice for my dog (because he has a genetic condition that effects his eyes). How about just educating people about the dangers of antibiotics, and letting them make up their own mind. The situation couldn&#x27;t get any worse than it already is. Right now doctors give out steroids and antibiotics as if they were candy, especially in large hospitals.

But I totally get the choice overload thing. There&#x27;s a lot of people interested in javascript from all different areas of computer land, and they all have different ideas of what &quot;best&quot; is, and they all want to make javascript more like lisp, or more like ruby, or more like java, or more like c# or more like flash, and so on and so forth.<p>If you just need a choice, somewhere to start. I&#x27;ll make some choices for you. Here&#x27;s the zen selection. My view of the standard javascript library:<p>jquery ($)<p>underscore (_)<p>mustache ({{}}) (possibly accentuated by iCanHaz)<p>Backbone (Backbone)<p>And that&#x27;s your basic starter pack. \nIt&#x27;s a confused ecosystem because it was only since about 2007 that people started to realise that javascript was an actual programming language and not just a stupid toy. I remember that year chatting with people on #javascript on IRC who simply didn&#x27;t believe that I had an actual full time job writing server side javascript. the idea seemed too absurd. And so here we are, a mere 7 years later and we&#x27;ve pieced together a very humble ecosystem in the face of that level of bald hatred and misunderstanding. I remember it wasn&#x27;t so long ago that flash was in a similar position, and not long before that, java, with its popular image being its slow crummy applets.<p>So, yes, in conclusion, you&#x27;re right, and it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s young and every language goes through this stage.",1389954485

7075057,story,7072769,,1,0,thisishugo,,,"I found the Rdio app on Android to be a little buggy (it would always pause itself when transitioning from the first to the second streamed song, but not on subsequent transitions), and slow, but the iPhone app has been rock solid, and despite being a Xamarin app, it feels surprisingly native. I just moved from a Google Play Edition HTC One to an iPhone 5s and Rdio is way faster now, too, which is a bonus. Spotify, as you say, sucks balls on both devices.<p>Rdio also offers a desktop app, which gives it an advantage over the next best app I used, Google Play Music, which I liked well enough during the 30 day trial, but being confined to in a browser tab doesn&#x27;t work for me - I need my keyboard&#x27;s media controls to work.<p>I&#x27;ve extensively tested every music streaming service going over the last half decade, some as part of my job[0][1] and some as a &quot;normal&quot; consumer, and settled on Rdio in the latter part of last year. My mobile phone contract actually provides me with a Deezer subscription free of charge, and I still pay for Rdio, I find it that much better than the competition.<p>I&#x27;ve had a couple of annoying incidences of music being there one day, and disappearing the next with Rdio, but that&#x27;s happened on every one of these services I&#x27;ve used, because the labels are fickle bedfellows.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/music-subscription-service-round-u"" rel=""nofollo"">http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/music-subscription-se...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/music-streaming-services-round-u"" rel=""nofollo"">http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/music-streaming-servi...</a>",1389953100

So that would be compatible with that goal - but only if he thinks he can&#x27;t do it himself anymore.<p>The fact that this rumor is almost a year old is probably a hint that the deal failed.

Penicillin is one such example.<p>To discount the value of observations is to ignore an important part of the discovery process.<p>There is extremely limited data available around the use of nootropics for mind enhancement (as opposed to in medical use for treating illness). In the absence of of such data a survey like this indicates that there are a few things worth studying in more depth (and some supposed nootropics that seem worthless).<p>The author appears extremely aware of the problems with their methodology, and makes no attempts to hide these problems. To pull quotes:<p><i>The online nootropics community consists of mostly healthy individuals looking to use these substances to gain motivation or clearer thinking. They tend to “outpace” the scientific literature, using some substances that haven’t yet been shown to work, or haven’t been shown to benefit healthy individuals.</i>\n...\n&quot; I would have liked to have some placebo nootropics to use as a comparison, but since I wasn’t running a trial, I didn’t have that option. I did, however, try to assess the placebo effect in a couple of sneaky ways.&quot;\n...\n&quot;I have very low confidence that these represent real effects rather than artifacts of the gymnastics I had to do to make the data correlatable at all, and I report them only to encourage other people to do more sober analyses.&quot;<p>I think attempting to do this - knowing that people will criticize the methodology - is admirable.",1392591443

7249637,comment,7248517,7248517,29,0,proggy123,,,"I&#x27;ve been taking modafinil for a while now (over a year). I initially started taking it to help with a massive workload at my job. I was a long-time software engineer at Google at the time. I was utterly burned out and couldn&#x27;t retain my focus for more than 10-15 minutes- definitely not enough when you&#x27;re writing c++ code and need to retain a huge amount of state in your head (header file definitions, pointer ownership, etc. etc.). But i wasn&#x27;t in a situation where i could immediately take time off or change jobs/groups. So i started taking Modafinil to see if it would help me concentrate and get things done.<p>The immediate benefit and the thing that i still love it for today is how focused it makes me. As a programmer, most of my day is just getting things typed out. Pure creative thinking is maybe 1 hour a day at best. Without modafinil, if people came and interrupted me, i would get distracted, surf the web and it could easily take me upto an hour to get my head back in the code (especially since i hated what i was doing). With Modafinil, i would just retain stuff and be able to get back to work immediately. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s. Even on a good day, without Modafinil, i could stay in flow for maybe an hour or so before i would get distracted and lose focus. On Modafinil, 3 hours is average, 4 hours happens sometimes.<p>You know when you&#x27;re fixing bugs in a big codebase and for each bug you kind of have to load up state in your head and think -oh yeah i need to change x,y,z here and a,b,c there and these tests 1,2,3 have to change and i should probably make sure foo and bar are still working. Well with modafinil i was able to think of that and keep all of it in my head for the 2-3 hours it would take me to type out a fix. Or you&#x27;re reading a few bug reports and you are working on fixing one - you look at the file you&#x27;re in and realize that while you&#x27;re working in that file you could fix 2 or 3 other things or you could do a refactor - and you just do it without losing state in your head of where you are in the original bug. Modafinil let me do that- it was totally like a ram upgrade. (Or really like i wasn&#x27;t burned out or was 25 again or something).<p>So yeah my short-term recall also went up. Another example - at google we had lots of command line tools each with tons of options. It used to be a real mental effort for me to recall the 8-10 options i would have to pass on the command-line along with gigantic path and filenames to get something simple done. This isn&#x27;t uncommon- some of the most popular internal webpages are commandline option references for the really common tools. And it was a huge distraction - to have to drop what you&#x27;re doing to have to go to some webpage, scroll around or click find until you found some poorly documented option that maybe did what you wanted etc. With Modafinil, that was all just in my head for the whole day - enough so that at the end of the day i could make up shell scripts for the useful stuff, but during the day i could work really fast because i wasn&#x27;t looking stuff up all the time.<p>So yeah it did great things for me. But the bad news- i tried taking it every day - after a week, paranoia set in and mood swings. I would get extremely defensive about simple comments in code reviews. Typically i would take 200mg only in the morning so i could sleep at night- but if my schedule was bad and i went more than 3-4 days without sleep i would start having persistent hallucinations that lasted 10-15 seconds - not just corner of the eye stuff but talking to people who weren&#x27;t there.<p>Nowadays, i take it at most 100 mg at a time a maximum of twice a week. I really enjoy programming and i want to think i&#x27;m good at it so taking Modafinil felt a little like cheating with steroids or something. My current job is much easier than Google and I&#x27;ve been able to replace most of the positive effects of Moda by doing a ton more planning - e.g. i help my short term memory by writing copious comments, keeping a detailed log of exactly what i&#x27;m doing in org-mode, exercising good email discipline, writing code much more defensively so i don&#x27;t actually keep a lot of state in my head etc. etc. I meditate every day even for 5 minutes just in case that will help with focus. A lot of this works really well. But if the shit hits the fan at work and I&#x27;m debugging blind in a bunch of crappy code i&#x27;ve never seen before, or my fragile ego requires I be the guy who is just faster than others and gets stuff done, that&#x27;s when i still reach for Modafinil.",1392589538

For one of our internal applications, we had so much <script> tags embedded into our single-page-app index.html that it was very hard to keep track of dependencies. If you have a straight dependency order, sure it won&#x27;t matter, but if you start refactoring things out and one module has a bunch of dependencies that also has dependencies, this essentially degrades into rolling out a manual topological sort of the javascript files you include. On top of this more than one engineer works on the application, and different engineers inserting <script> tags at the same time caused a few headaches.<p>To mitigate this, we introduced RequireJS to our internal app, and now the dependency is declared at module definition so you don&#x27;t have to sift through a list of <script> tags.  You don&#x27;t fear breaking dependencies of each script files because you put one on top of the other. IMHO it is much better to declare the dependencies to your module explicitly than implicitly through a very carefully topologically sorted series of <script> tags.",1392589337

Oracle, IBM, Tibco, SAS - these were enterprise companies and Microsoft was a consumer software company.<p>But that by and large is unimportant history for what they face now. There has been a sea change in the relationship large corporations have with their information technology departments. For most of the time since computers became a basic necessity for white collar workers, the IT group dictated what devices could and should be used. They bought specific laptops or desktops and that was it. If you wanted to use a personal information management device like a Palm Pilot or Windows CE device, you had to plug it into the computer at the office. That meant IT had to approve the device because they needed to ensure its compatibility with their Windows setup and your enterprise infrastructure.<p>I dont need to regurgitate what happened, but needless to say we no longer need that tether and devices now speak directly to the services. This frees management and workers to buy the devices they need and want. Upper management gets an iPhone or iPad and they want to work with it, IT has to bend. I have seen this in our consulting practice over and over - IT did not want to allow iPads but C*O level folks insisted and voila, we now support iPads. IT did not come around, they were forced by good consumer devices that just worked.<p>Microsoft recognizes this sea change and knows that they have to be a player and a big one in the consumer device market as this market is now dictating to IT, not the other way around. Consumer devices now drive the choices in the enterprise so Microsoft cannot give up here, they have to double down.",1392588876

7249566,comment,7248517,7248517,3,0,tokenadult,,,"Okay, I have read the fine blog post (which took a while to load). The article leads off by defining nootropics as &quot;substances which purportedly improve mental functioning with relatively few side effects when used responsibility.&quot;<p>The blog post author mentions a few small-n, limited duration studies, and then describes his voluntary-response survey methodology:<p>&quot;I asked people in the two largest online nootropics communities (that I know of), Reddit’s r/nootropics and Longecity’s Brain Health forum, to take a survey describing their use of 31 different substances. I got 162 responses.&quot;<p>&quot;Respondents were asked to rate their subjective experiences of different nootropics on a scale of zero (completely useless, did nothing) to ten (life-changing). Comments on Reddit suggest several people misunderstood the scale, but not much I can do about that at this point.&quot;<p>So all the data here are voluntary-response data, with the known problem of response bias[1] and other defects about which I have an entire FAQ[2] I post on HN from time to time. Worse than that, all the data are self-report data,[3] which also have plenty of problems, even when gathered in a comprehensive survey with a representative sample of the general population, because of the risks of incorrect self-reports unless checked by other data sources that are objective.[4]<p>The blog post author then gives a lengthy description, with pretty colored charts, of his hand-waving statistical analysis of these dubious voluntary reponse, self-report data. It would not be wise (that is, it would not be a sign of improved mental functioning) to take these conclusions seriously as a description of how nootropics work, or indeed if they work at all. The author would do well to study fundamental principles of statistics by reading the online articles &quot;Advice to Mathematics Teachers on Evaluating Introductory Statistics Textbooks&quot;[5] and &quot;The Introductory Statistics Course: A Ptolemaic Curriculum?&quot;[6] to wrap his mind around how strictly necessary it is to have a valid data-gathering plan before engaging in any statistical manipulation of the data. Garbage in, garbage out. More background on experiment design to think about while evaluating the blog post kindly submitted here can be found in the essay &quot;Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation&quot;[7] by Peter Norvig, LISP hacker and director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.<p>What might big-time convince me to try out a nootropic substance would be an objective demonstration that someone with typical abilities (say, someone who goes into online discussion with a known propensity to believe what&#x27;s on Reddit without checking it) can become a person with thoughtful insight (say, someone like Peter Norvig) at adult age simply by ingesting the nootropic. On my part, I like to improve mental functioning with relatively few side effects as much as anybody here, and one way I attempt to do that in middle age is by reading thoughtful articles by careful scholars and then discussing those among the learned participants on Hacker News. I&#x27;d appreciate comments from any of you about how one could know, objectively and verifiably, that a nootropic substance really does people good (even if they don&#x27;t feel that themselves). I especially invite comments from participants here who have a professional understanding of statistical studies in clinical trials of new medicines.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2322237"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2322237</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-report_study"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-report_study</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15528061"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15528061</a><p><a href=""http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/barker/supp/excerpt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/barker/supp/excerpt.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a>",1392588443

7249560,comment,7249193,7249193,38,0,hobohacker,,,"I think the author of this blogpost has a few things off:<p>- HTTP2 != httpbis. Both work is being done by the same working group &quot;httpbis&quot;. <a href=""http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/</a> covers this. httpbis (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9105639/httpbis-what-does-bis-mean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9105639/httpbis-what-does...</a>) was originally chartered to revise HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)\n  The working group will refine RFC2616 to:\n  * Incorporate errata and updates (e.g., references, IANA registries, ABNF)\n  * Fix editorial problems which have led to misunderstandings of the specification\n  * Clarify conformance requirements\n  * Remove known ambiguities where they affect interoperability\n  * Clarify existing methods of extensibility\n  * Remove or deprecate those features that are not widely implemented and also unduly affect interoperability\n  * Where necessary, add implementation advice\n  * Document the security properties of HTTP and its associated mechanisms (e.g., Basic and Digest authentication, cookies, TLS) for common applications<p>As for the HTTP/2 work, here&#x27;s a snippet from the charter on that:\n  The Working Group will produce a specification of a new expression of HTTP&#x27;s current semantics in ordered, bi-directional streams. As with HTTP/1.x, the primary target transport is TCP, but it should be possible to use other transports.<p>- He seems to think the httpbis folks gratuitously redefined 301. It should be noted that RFC2616 (which, by definition, predates the httpbis work since httpbis is defined to <i>revise</i> RFC2616) had already noted the issue with 301 (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.2</a>):\n  Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a GET request.<p>- It&#x27;s unclear to me whether or not the author acknowledges the existence of buggy implementations as noted in section 10.3.2. It&#x27;s an open question as to what to do in the presence of buggy implementations. From a server standpoint, if the client is buggy, and you don&#x27;t want to break the client (willingness to break clients probably depends on how many of the server&#x27;s users use that client), then you will attempt to work around it, irrespective of what the standard says. Therefore, it&#x27;s simply pragmatic to ignore the spec if it doesn&#x27;t mirror reality, and pragmatic spec editors may update the spec to acknowledge this difference.<p>- As far as current status of the various 308 usages, Julian (author of the 308 draft) is lobbying major user agents to adopt this, and has written up a status update on the Chromium bug tracker: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=109012#c28"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=109012#c...</a>.",1392588351

They know all the kludges and hacks that are hiding behind the scenes. As a designer it&#x27;s your job to help them get past that.<p>Being able to communicate is one of the most important skills a designer can have. If engineers don&#x27;t understand the importance of good design that is your failing, not theirs.  Talking about delight and pixel-perfection to the wrong audience just makes you sound like a Jony Ives wanna-be.<p>Merely asking everyone stops to sprint towards a perfect design shows a lack of empathy towards your team mates. At launch time everyone has features they needed to cut or temporary hacks they never got to fix. Telling team mates the most important thing is to &quot;perfect&quot; a vision they haven&#x27;t bought in to is not a convincing argument. And viewing their hard work as a &quot;sloppy version of my design&quot; is not likely to win favors either.<p>The most effective designers I&#x27;ve worked with have been able to create and also sell their design.

The authors of nearly all the myriad ""how to fix twitter"" posts I've read have trivialized scaling a site that has different properties from most online services.

197530,comment,197182,197301,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yeah, I'm in the same (weird) boat.  I've been using Linux as my primary OS for so many years (about 10, now) that a Windows or Mac machine feels hopelessly short of applications to me.  I know the reality is the opposite...it's just that when I think, ""I need to draw a new icon"", I don't think ""open Illustrator"", I think ""open Inkscape"", and almost every ""I need to..."" thought involves the command line (because I work faster there, mostly), and Mac OS X and Windows are hopelessly baroque when it comes to the command line.<p>Then again, these days, I use so few ""Linux only"" applications that it would probably be easier than ever to switch.  My ""regular usage"" list is: vim, Firefox, Thunderbird, Perl, bash (and all of the GNU tools, like sed, grep, find, locate, awk, etc.), GIMP, Inkscape, VNC, KVM.  But I'd still have to have Linux boxes or virtual machines around, because I need build environments for a dozen or so Linux distributions.  And bash and the GNU tools are so vital to my workflow that I'd be suffering a lot of the time.<p>So, I've considered getting a Mac so that I'd be surrounded by great design (I'm becoming more of a designer and usability guy within my company every day, and my design sense is still woefully inadequate for the job, and I've read on numerous occasions and from numerous sources that one great technique for improving is to surround yourself with great design), but it'd certainly be painful.<p>Also, middle-mouse-button paste is vital to my happiness, and neither Mac OSX nor Windows has it.",1211488302

197520,comment,197329,197329,0,0,stcredzero,,,"When a Smalltalk image saves, it's very analogous to a Windows or Linux box hibernating.  The upshot of this -- you can think of the Smalltalk image as something like an OS that has been ""up"" since 1980!  (With periods of hibernation.)  The Squeak image is directly derived from the Smalltalk-80 image.  The VisualWorks image has been incrementally evolved from it as well.  The thing is a program that was brought up decades ago, and has hibernated, been replicated, but <i>has never rebooted</i>!<p>Steve is right that systems should never have to boot.  You can have a whole OS that operates like that.  (The Smalltalk image started out as an OS.  In the original ST-80 image, there are 4 primitives for moving the drive head out, moving it in, lifting it off the platter, and putting it down!)",1211487814

197512,comment,196149,197067,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Adam has explained to me why their approach was different from Hecl, but I won't attempt to reproduce that explanation, since I don't actually know what Hecl <i>or</i> Tsumobi are all about.  I have vague notions, and when I'm actually talking to Adam or Josh about it it all makes beautiful sense...but then they stop talking, the fog returns, and I have no idea what it is they're building.<p>What I'm saying is, they're really smart guys working in a field that I know almost nothing about, and doing work that walks a razor fine line between ""research"" and ""product"".  Thus, one of their biggest problems in reaching a market, reaching investors, or reaching developers, is making what they're working on into a concrete solution to a real-world problem that everyone (or at least their customers) can understand quickly.  I think they'd be a bargain for anyone that hired them (either by investing in them or acquiring Tsumobi) because they are extremely smart kids with huge ideas, but I'm not sure how many people will see that based on what they're building.<p>And, while I'm pontificating, I don't think I'd be crazy to suggest that the best thing they could do would be to get their current code into the hands of some customers--even just a few.  Because nothing guides you to providing value like having customers.  And the more they pay (or the more ownership they have, if it's an Open Source project), the more value they demand...and that's a good thing when it comes to finding a need and filling it.",1211487343

197503,comment,197392,197432,0,0,diego,,,"I'm sure by now the Twitter team must be very aware of what their bottlenecks are. I don't know what the typical user Twitter user does. I personally send 1-5 messages per day but refresh the web timeline all the time. If most people are like me, then I would want to keep the last 24-48 hours worth of messages in memory. This shouldn't be a problem, as we are talking about 1M messages times 200 bytes or so, uncompressed.<p>In order to generate a page, you'd need a ""follow"" matrix. Given a user, you want to know who this person is following and pick up enough recent messages to generate a page view from the memory table above. This ""follow"" matrix would be relatively sparse (I imagine). It must be persisted often but given that it's queried all the time it would have to be in memory as well, at least partially. Assuming that Twitter has 2M users and the average user follow 40 people (wild guess), the entire matrix would take up 80M ids (a few hundred megabytes in a hashmap or something).<p>Also, I'd cache personal timeline requests for a minute or so, to avoid being killed by people hitting Ctrl-F5.<p>Of course the devil is in the details. All that information needs to be persisted and crash-recoverable. For the numbers above everything might work on a single beefy server but probably not for long, so the system has to distributable.<p>It's not an easy problem, but a competent team should be able to solve it (perhaps not in the most elegant and cleanly documented way) in a matter of weeks given the right motivation.

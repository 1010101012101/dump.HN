I just started working today on a social network crossed with a CMS that aims to be way simpler and flexible than Facebook and the rest. (But when I actually started writing the code, there were a few things I conveniently forgot that will definitely slow development down.)",1228467494

If a slightly better ranking in the SERP can double your revenue for the month, then it's well worth it.<p>And you could make a strong argument that google is using that bandwidth on behalf of it's users.<p>But yeah, this article betrays a staggering, if outright wilful ignorance of the actual functioning of the network.",1228467360

That seems like a giant roadmap for anyone who may have heard about YC and never seriously considered it before.<p>I guess the test is: Were the pitches clustering more around those ideas?",1228466073

So far, the evidence that population IQ -- which is what is at issue here -- is influenced by genetics is far more sketchy. The distinction is rather important, because of the sensitivity of the issue of racial IQ differences.",1228465942

The one thing I haven't had to deal with before is DNS. Is installing/setting up BIND the best alternative? What would you guys recommend?<p>2) Let's say I have a Rails app and 6 domains, each of which has a slightly different landing page. What's the best way to deploy things such that all six domains share the one app/db?<p>Thanks for your help!",1228465646

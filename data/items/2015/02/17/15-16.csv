It is one thing if the price was 10% off, but in this case it is like a 90% reduction if not more (depending on which first class fare class the tickets were in, £52 instead of £1000-1500).<p>The only thing I will add as far as fairness goes, is that customers are often held to a different standard. If a customer makes a mistake in their booking, they have approx. 24 hours to fix it for &quot;free.&quot; If a company makes a mistake they often have near unlimited time to fix it (until check-in?).<p>But as far as cancelling mistakes in general?

9062883,comment,9062132,9062365,0,0,agwa,,,"Instead of sandboxing the entire app, you should use privilege separation inside VLC.  Low-risk code would run in processes with higher privileges, while the high-risk code (e.g. the decoders) would run in highly sandboxed processes and communicate with the privileged processes over a simple interface.  This is the approach used by security-conscious server apps (e.g. openssh, postfix, dovecot) as well as Google Chrome, and I think it has more promise than trying to sandbox entire apps.  Many apps have complex access requirements (much more than the game used as an example in this blog post) and trying to sandbox them will require granting so much privilege that the sandbox becomes almost meaningless.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on converting a PDF viewer to use privilege separation.  I&#x27;d love to see a media player use privilege separation too.  Does VLC currently have pretty clear separation between its various components?

Most people buy them for themselves.  Items are also typically eaten for one meal, but it&#x27;s college students so that&#x27;s to be expected.<p>>  It&#x27;s a mistaken assumption that one meal ought to be only 1/3 of your daily calorie intake<p>I think what they&#x27;re getting at is what you&#x27;re also making a point about; that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be eaten in one setting.  The point of lower calories is is gives you more options with what you can eat without gaining weight (assuming you&#x27;re not on a weight-gain program for power lifting).  What&#x27;s deceiving is that, while Chipotle offers the full ranges of calories for their food, they don&#x27;t mention that if you go through with all the things they offer then you usually end up in the 1000+ range.  I wouldn&#x27;t doubt if there are many people downing 1000+ calories thinking that they&#x27;re closer to 600.<p>> focusing on calorie and sodium counts is an incomplete way to assess the healthiness of the food<p>This is correct, but to a point.  An excess of calories, unless offset by regular exercise, leads to weight gain, which is collectively unhealthy for our society.  There&#x27;s obviously much more to it (an obese person who can run a mile is considered healthier than a skinny person who can&#x27;t for example), but that&#x27;s failing to see the bigger picture.  The point is, people in developed countries are shoving more calories into themselves than they need, and places like Chipotle aren&#x27;t a haven of good health - they&#x27;re also part of the problem.",1424188441

In fact, if you are eating decent food and keeping fat% at ~30-40, I guarantee you that you will have troubles eating more than 2500 kcal per day. If you drink lots of soda and crap like than, then yes, you can manage even 3000.

Just to clarify, I have never said that you lose wait eating as much as you want, I said I think we should consider the number of calories more broadly. Use ranges and look into the weekly intakes too. Check what you eat. Kill all the refined sugars. Kill all the complex foods. Start cooking. That will help you more than counting kcals to the gram. It&#x27;s about how you shift your way of thinking about food.

I can generally get two meals out of a Chipotle burrito. Many do, of course, but that can&#x27;t be sussed out of the data they used. In addition, the chips sides are sized to share, and I&#x27;d wager that most people who order those do share with someone else.<p>2. It&#x27;s a mistaken assumption that one meal ought to be only 1/3 of your daily calorie intake. Most of the meals came in around 1000 calories, but I also bet that for most people, this is their largest meal of the day.<p>3. The recommended maximum sodium intake of 2.4g is probably too low based on many recent studies. Sodium intake is only a significant risk for a very small handful of the population, and in fact low sodium intake is as risky if not more risky, and there&#x27;s good evidence that 2.4g/day is on the low end of long-term positive health outcomes.<p>Given the freshness and quality of the ingredients at Chipotle, and the simplicity and openness with which the food is prepared, focusing on calorie and sodium counts is an incomplete way to assess the healthiness of the food. I guarantee that a meal with fewer calories from McDonalds or in a microwaveable box is going to be overall far less healthy.",1424187376

The problem is not unique to other countries as it happens within the US too, but at least within our own legal system there are ways to protect clients and ourselves better.  When dealing Internationally, the chances for a startup to guard their intellectual property and competitive advantage is far less likely.<p>And honestly, the companies that have been most successful in outsourcing Internationally, generally have a presence in Country.  Microsoft, Oracle, GE among hundreds of others (I did this for/with GE for a time period). For a startup splitting a small team Internationally to try and save on what should be a core skillset and competitive advantage just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Not to mention, the only thing of value for a startup early on is the team they assemble. If that team is not dedicated, is out sourced and worse yet, outsourced Internationally, the startup will struggle to gain the attention of investors if that is what they desire.<p>Last point, if you are bootstrapping then the equation (and risk profile) can change.

He interacts with people who have no clue about data science, and is able to use the data to tell a convincing story. This can be dangerous if he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, but 90% of things people want to use &quot;data science&quot; for are pretty trivial technically and probably can be done in Excel.<p>The guy designing a novel algorithm probably operates in a technical context. People like this tend to be very &quot;in the weeds&quot; and incapable of succinctly explaining their findings to people without the same context they have. This is a universal problem -- people who are extremely technically skilled often have trouble explaining their craft to, say, a marketing exec wanting to know how a certain characteristic is derived. In fact, the marketing exec will probably call in the Excel data scientist to translate.<p>Does this mean the guy designing the novel algorithm is somehow lesser? Absolutely not! But when you choose a deeply technical career path, you run the risk of losing the external context. This is why many companies have managers in engineering who aren&#x27;t super technical -- they&#x27;re technical enough to understand the jist of the concept, but their core skill is communication. If they&#x27;re doing their job well, the engineers are left alone to do their job without senior business people sticking their noses in everything.<p>Coincidentally (or maybe not), I think the &quot;soft skills&quot; are sorely missing in this skills matrix. Every engineer will have to give a presentation or work with an external team at some point in their careers, and some are better at it than others. In my opinion, the guys with hardcore engineering skills are great, but someone with solid engineering skills who can communicate well is a rock star. You can replace a badass engineer, but you can&#x27;t easily replace the cross-team relationships that a good communicator has built that can often short-circuit requirements problems before they get turned into code.",1424186787

Remarkably, still a major issue even in tier-1 cities in China. Not so much of a problem in India, but it&#x27;s still there to a degree.<p>2) Quality. This is a big one. I&#x27;ve worked with some great developers and some really, <i>really</i> terrible developers. The former seem to be a rare breed. I can interview dozens of pre-screened candidates before I find someone who is any good at all. Never assume what is written on CVs/resumes as truthful until you&#x27;ve assessed candidates!<p>3) Culture. Don&#x27;t underestimate the impact of this one. I&#x27;m a seasoned traveller, but working with people from other cultures can still be challenging at times. In my experience, &#x27;face&#x27; is an issue when working with Chinese developers, and lack of directness and pro-activeness is an issue when working with Indian developers (sweeping generalisations, I know; just my experiences). These can have a big impact on your projects if you are not on top of it. Something else to consider in India is that it&#x27;s very difficult to find people with many years of experience, as most people there don&#x27;t see software development as a career - it&#x27;s seen as an on-ramp to management positions, and there is a stigma attached to being a developer for &#x27;too long&#x27; without being promoted.<p>4) Time difference. This can work for or against you, depending on what you want. I&#x27;m a firm believer than the best way to work with offshore developers is to work <i>together</i>, so unless one side is willing to change their working times, it&#x27;s certainly a problem for me.<p>5) Previous failure. I&#x27;ve found many people have tried doing offshore development &#x27;the wrong way&#x27;, and it&#x27;s left then disillusioned. Simply throwing a specification over the wall to a remote team will <i>not</i> work. Ever. Failure guaranteed!<p>I want to finish by saying it <i>can</i> work, if done properly. Over the past few years I&#x27;ve built up a team of 8 good, dependable developers in India. I&#x27;ve done this by working closely with them, spending time with them in India, conducting training sessions, buying Pluralsight subscriptions for them, encouraging direct dialogue and pro-activeness, mentoring, and generally spending a lot of time communicating. Of course, this all takes a lot of time and effort (and some money too!).",1424186780

Understanding your current position relative to your goal is incredibly important to maintaining having a clear mind during stressful circumstances. If your to-do list isn&#x27;t logged somewhere, get it into the medium of your choice (physical or electronic). The cognitive load of those tasks is undoubtedly weighing on you. Keep paper nearby when you&#x27;re going to sleep so any sudden thoughts can be offloaded immediately without the glowing allure of a display panel.<p>Prioritize: Are there some to-dos which have blockers? You might need an image from a 3rd party, task interdependencies, some information from someone working on the project... get those things happening in parallel while you work (start them as early as possible).<p>Keep the feedback loop short: Is it possible some part of the deliverable is going to be rejected or changes may be required? Can you mock it up and save some development time? Try to have the highest possible confidence in what you&#x27;re building and keep the feedback loop small. Not only does provide you a requirements guarantee, it can help prevent unrealistic expectations about progress since everyone is kept updated as a side effect of the feedback loop. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of thinking &quot;it&#x27;s only 3 days anyways, they don&#x27;t need to be involved, I just need to get this done.&quot;<p>Stay balanced: Don&#x27;t increase or decrease caffeine intake. Decreasing it drag you down, increase will make you have manic productivity swings with deep valleys. Don&#x27;t skip sleep, meals or exercise. Even if you don&#x27;t normally exercise you should start during this period to prevent your mind from racing and to help rest at night. Do it daily as vigorously as you can, figure out if AM or PM works best for you. If you have a friend or significant other you can involve, it can help get more out of your limited free time between now and the deadline.",1424185927

That doesn&#x27;t stop outright malware but it removes one of the legal fig-leaves which ad-ware vendors rely on and exactly supports your stated goal above by allowing a user to learn how to manage add-ons and remove something annoying without having their decision reset by the adware.<p>The real problem, however, is that it&#x27;s currently fantasy to assume that any has enough information to make these decisions because a) the permissions models are still basically all-or-nothing and b) the halting problem has not yet been solved. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not just a question of tweaking the permissions models – as Android has shown, all that does is train users to approve blindly because every single app requests access to just about everything. That&#x27;s not something we can fix overnight because it involves both things like better permissions models and changing the structure of the environment to be closer to something like WebIntents where many classes of add-on are only executed in response to specific user actions.<p>Until we reach that promised land, however, I don&#x27;t see the big deal to Mozilla requiring you follow a free signing process for an extension so add-ons can easily be killed if needed and publishing something deceptive will require you to burn a developer account.

Use at your own discretion. A lot of quote-unquote &quot;high-quality&quot; Ruby code I&#x27;ve seen is either biased towards readability, biased towards extensibility, or sitting somewhere on the edge between the two. So I really do think every Ruby developer should at least glance at this collection and be familiar with it.",1438790397

Although the bay is awesome if you are a developer, San Francisco and the US in general is lagging behind other countries in terms of livability compared to many other countries in Europe. work-life balance takes a hit, health insurance is not free, public commute sucks, education is expensive etc. I have been thinking about moving to Europe to experience the lifestyle there. Many countries in Europe (Vienna, Switzerland, Germany etc) consistently show up in the list of most livable countries in the world published by multiple sources. I am wondering what the best way is to find developer jobs in these countries, and if anyone else out there also is thinking/thought about this",1438790380

Let&#x27;s look at a simple one - the icons on iOS safari for frequently visited websites.  They &quot;randomly&quot; assign the wrong favicon e.g. I click the Facebook icon and it loads Hacker News.  This has been present since iOS 8.  Yesterday I pulled down the notification screen and it occupies only 50% of my screen.  Cue another reboot of the iPhone.<p>My iMac.  Upgrading to Yosemite was the worst mistake ever.  Now I have to use a cheap mouse and keyboard, as Apple&#x27;s Bluetooth versions no longer wake the sleeping iMac.  I have tried every solution on the Internet to this and none fix it.  The beachball is becoming ever more prominent on the iMac too.  Very disappointing for a machine which isn&#x27;t 3 years old.<p>My Macbook Air.  It&#x27;s better, but the power button no longer does anything when I press it.<p>Apple products have a huge premium and the quality of the software is not matching the price tag.  I am not surprised to see the stock falling; usually when IBM buy your products en masse you know something is wrong :)<p>I don&#x27;t know what the culture at Apple is.  But I don&#x27;t think their software developers can be anything other than the &quot;norm&quot; - and I am extremely worried about their automated testing culture.  Maybe someone can comment.<p>EDIT: I just remembered my Apple Cr*p folder home to Podcasts, Tips, Apple Watch, Calendar, Health, Apple Store, Apple Maps, Videos, Reminders and Newstand.  Podcasts actually cost me money when it started downloaded podcasts over 3G despite me saying wifi only.  I think that bug got fixed, but I&#x27;ll never trust it again.  I also forgot about the white elephant that is the Apple Time capsule I purchased.  It&#x27;s slow over wifi from the iMac and was one of the causes of my beachball, but the main issue was it kept saying it couldn&#x27;t back up because the disk was locked.  For a company like Apple who should supposedly simplify backup, the product is a shambles.  Maybe this is better now, but I won&#x27;t be upgrading.",1438790351

Since that time the carriers&#x27; backhaul capacity needs increased significantly, driving them to fiber-feed their sites or use 23GHz licensed.

There has to be a connection traced from every network requests back to the JS context which ultimately caused the request (e.g., by mutating the DOM). This is doable, it&#x27;s just a lot of work.<p>2. There can&#x27;t be <i>any</i> way to execute JavaScript in the page - even with page&#x27;s principal. Such mechanisms exist today by design because developers desire them.<p>3. Even if you do 1 and 2, there are still channels such as hyperlinks. The extension could add a hyperlink and get the user to click on it. I suppose you could try and tie that back to the script context that created or modified the hyperlink.<p>4. Even if you do 1-3, if you can induce the page script (or any other extension, or the browser, or the user) to request a URL of your design, you win.<p>Sigh.

The idea is that index funds implicitly favor collusion between companies in the same industry since investors/institutions own the competing companies (perhaps even at the same weight). That is, an index owning both Coke and Pepsi may not be too keen on one slaying the other, but instead for them both to become bigger together, yet separate.<p>There&#x27;s also the idea that index investing &quot;should&quot; be considered illegal because of the possible antitrust issues.<p>Also, the rise of index investing puts more favor to stock buybacks/dividends as opposed to reinvestment. The idea being (as an example) that the index would rather take Coke&#x27;s profits and redirect to a smaller higher-growth-potential company (or even spread it out more evenly among all holdings). However, if no index investing, perhaps investors would be more willing to &quot;ride it out&quot; with Coke reinvesting a lot more profits back into the business (maybe the don&#x27;t own Pepsi, or other soft-drink companies and want to see them all get demolished).",1438788063

10010389,comment,10008464,10008464,0,0,bradleyland,,,"This is a great collection, but any listing of microbenchmarks needs a caveat.<p>Consider the first example, parallel assignment vs sequential assignment. As we can see by the results, parallel assignment is 2.25x slower, which seems like a monumental impact to performance, right? If all your application does is assign a few variables and exit, sure, but very few applications are this simplistic. In order to make a good judgement call on this optimization, you have to understand the impact within the context of your application:<p>What is the total execution time of your application?<p>What portion of that execution time is spent on assignment?<p>What portion of that execution time is spent on the extra allocation of an array due to parallel assignment?<p>At the bottom of the benchmark, we can see the iteration rate for each. Parallel assignment managed a rate of 2521708.9 iterations per second. We can work out the total execution time per iteration from this number:<p>Single iteration as a fraction of a second: 1/2521708.9<p>In decimal form: 0.000000396556478 s<p>Converted to milliseconds: 0.000397 ms<p>The same conversion for for parallel assignment gets us: 0.0001758783 ms.<p>In each iteration, we save 0.0002206782 ms.<p>Circling back to my list of questions, what is the total execution time of my application? If my app uses an I/O calls — and especially network I/O — it could be hundreds of ms. At this delta, it would take over 4,500 iterations of this optimization to achieve an improvement of 1 ms. If we&#x27;re talking about an operation that occurs locally and is 100% in-memory, execution times may be <50 ms, at which point, you&#x27;d need around 2,250 iterations to get a 1 ms improvement.<p>At this point, I have to tattle on myself. This is an obtuse method of analysis. Microbenchmarks are hard, and at the i/s rate we&#x27;re seeing here, there could be confounding factors that the author (and I) haven&#x27;t accounted for. Things like garbage collection and object caching will have an impact at these time scales. Also, we have to ask whether our microbenchmark reflects reality? What real world application repeatedly assigns literals to variables millions of times per second? Extrapolating any meaningful decisions from the microbenchmarks alone is a fools errand.<p>The lesson is that microbenchmarks can only tell you so much. A comprehensive approach to optimization involves looking at the total run time and apportionment of time in an actual application. This process is called profiling, and the tools for profiling Ruby applications have improved in recent times.<p>Looking at the parallel vs sequential assignment difference, what you really want to know is whether parallel vs sequential assignment is impacting <i>your</i> application, and to what degree. Profiling tools will tell you where your application spends its time, and where it&#x27;s allocating memory. This tells you where to look. Microbenchmarks will tell you which idioms you pay a penalty for. The combination of the two allows you to make smart decisions.<p>If you have a a parallel assignment wrapped in a loop that will execute hundreds of thousands of times every time your application runs, this will show up during profiling. Moving to sequential optimization will likely pay dividends. Otherwise, the penalty paid for parallel assignment is probably minimal. Profiling is a good way to tell the difference.",1438788007

To play Devil&#x27;s advocate here we have always had the problems you mention and most likely always will; at least for a very long time. But there&#x27;s a very real chance (and very soon) that we won&#x27;t have these magnificent creatures like Lions/Rhinos/Elephants etc. The killing of a lion like Cecil (tagged, well known) increases that sense of urgency and concern that we seem unable to save these creatures from hunters and poachers. These are not renewable resources like cattle or chicken.<p>Secondly so many big problems are complex with multiple contributing factors and it&#x27;s hard to tell the victim from the perpetrator and often times those roles change over time. Cecil&#x27;s killing, much like the killing of a child, is very black and white. He was lured with game, shot with an arrow, suffered pain for 40 hours and was then shot and beheaded. There&#x27;s no shades of gray in there like &quot;Was he or she in the wrong place at the wrong time? Did they do something to contribute to their own demise via their behaviour? Are we going to find out some new fact in this case in 72 hours or at the trial that makes us realize there&#x27;s more to this victim than we thought?&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s this sense of losing for ever combined with the lack of any ambiguity that creates such a strong response.

People looking at something and finding it &quot;mindblowing&quot; for short periods says almost nothing about whether a) there is actual value delivered, or b) there&#x27;s a real business to be built there.<p>I can count at least 5 waves of 3D hype going back to the 1850s. Stereoscopic photos were all the rage for brief periods starting with the 1851 World&#x27;s Fair in London [1], and we are all familiar with the 3D View Master, which was developed in 1939. There was the anaglyph 3D [2] wave in the 1950s, and as the marketing suggests, the main audience appeal was novelty. [3] Next came, as you say, the VR wave of the 1990s, including predictions of &quot;affordable VR by 1994&quot;. [4] We next have this decade&#x27;s rise and fall of 3D movies, with a related rise and fall of 3D TV.<p>So far, history suggests that this is just another wave of novelty. 3D pictures did not replace pictures. 3D movies and TV did not replace movies and TV. The evidence is equally strong that many otherwise smart people can combine &quot;cool novelty effect&quot; plus &quot;OMG future&quot; and to end up fooling themselves.<p>Sure, it could be different this time. But I suspect that 3D will end up, for at least the 6th time, as being about as appealing as Smell-o-Vision. [5] This is in strong contrast to color and sound, which started out being optional and became mandatory both for movies and computers. Wake me up, I say, when we get to showing movies in &quot;Feel Around&quot;.

I don’t see how regulation might conceivably make it more difficult for “unregistered drivers” to rape women.<p>Easy - minicabs are not allowed to hang around outside clubs and pubs looking for business. Therefore drunk women are less likely to just stumble into any old car outside the venue, because they know the legal operators are a call (or app-click or whatever) away. They call a cab service, the call is on record, the company is licensed, the car that picked her up is recorded, the driver is a known individual.<p>>> All you need to understand is that even if it did, the rapists would just move on to more opportune circumstances for finding victims.<p>Maybe so, maybe not, it certainly takes away one comparatively easy avenue of attack.<p>>> Therefore, the regulation is not justified by the idea of preventing rape. It’s just not going to. I doubt you sincerely thought it would either.<p>Actually people think that in general it has helped. I&#x27;m not sure how possible it is to say definitely that is has or it hasn&#x27;t helped the overall number of rapes, there&#x27;s certainly no solid ground for you to say &quot;Therefore the regulation is not justified&quot;.<p>>> Alright, that’s it. I’m withdrawing your benefit of the doubt. Do you want me to believe you have no idea how people make successful sales on eBay, for example?<p>I withdrew yours some time ago, you&#x27;re clearly driven by ideology rather than reality. Yes, I know about ebay and rating services. No, I don&#x27;t agree they&#x27;re fit for purpose in all instances, sorry.<p>>> There’s always a reason. It’s just that it’s never to benefit the public, because there’s no point in ruling over people besides to benefit at their expense.<p>More ideologically driven nonsense. It&#x27;s very often to benefit the public.<p>>> How about: ”adhere to this contract, or we’ll sue you”?<p>Again, the action has already happened, already made other lives worse.

Well done!<p>No, there was no shaming implied there, simply stating that very often rules and regs have grown in these areas for good reasons that protect people and listing a few areas in which I consider them both useful and important.<p>--edit-- Please note I&#x27;m not saying Uber fall foul of that particular taxi regulation, it was just an example of a regulation that was put in place to protect the public <i>even if you think it was misguided</i>.

The problem is autocratic states can&#x27;t get past this stage very well.

Now they&#x27;re seen as a economic miracle at $26,000 GDP per capita compared to the North&#x27;s $1,800. In the 50s and 60s we all sat stunned at how well the North was beating the South!

The effect is the same as with any other predator-prey imbalance: the prey animal populations expand far beyond the ecosystem&#x27;s carrying capacity, leading to stress, disease, weakness, starvation, and numerous other ills among the prey population.

10010214,comment,10006953,10009952,0,0,rayiner,,,"I agree and disagree. Licensing is obsolete for a lot of cases. At the same time, smart radio technology isn&#x27;t there yet. In fact, this article is a great example of that. Both WiFi and LTE have pretty primitive spectrum sharing technology built in. But it doesn&#x27;t work that well together.<p>I worked on spectrum sharing technology as part of the DARPA XG project about 10 years ago. It worked great for many things and had some significant limitations. Not to mention, the necessary hardware is still very expensive (high bandwidth analog frontends, extremely sensitive detectors, substantial CPU and memory to run the algorithms). The simplified version of that sort of technology you have in LTE on unlicensed band is probably the best you can do without blowing your budget. And that&#x27;s not good enough to replace licensing. The challenge is probably a bit but not tremendously simpler than self-driving cars, and the relevant cost, size, and power budgets are a couple of orders of magnitude tighter.<p>Besides that, the ideal of smart radios interacting in a totally unregulated world is suboptimal. As Bill Lehr points out, smart radios work way better when you impose certain rules on everyone. See also Kevin Werbach&#x27;s work on the subject: <a href=""http://werbach.com/research/supercommons.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://werbach.com/research/supercommons.pdf</a>. The unlicensed band for example isn&#x27;t totally unregulated. You have strict power output limitations. But that&#x27;s sub-optimal. If you&#x27;re a WiFi access point in the country, you can probably use a lot more power without causing interference. At the same time, you don&#x27;t want to create a shouting match scenario, where each node ups their power output to drown out the others. More sophisticated rules help you get more efficient use of your unlicensed band. For example, you can mandate transmission power control (only enough power to close the link) you can mandate the use of FEC, so you don&#x27;t have dumb devices that can&#x27;t handle even a tiny bit of interference. Etc.<p>But you&#x27;re right about the big picture. Allocating spectrum is not the way forward. We don&#x27;t &quot;allocate road&quot; to cars--we just define rules they have to follow to play nicely with others on the road. Licensing has its place in enforcing those rules, and doesn&#x27;t need to imply fixed allocations.",1438786934

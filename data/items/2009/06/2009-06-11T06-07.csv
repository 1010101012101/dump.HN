And that should all be from memory.<p>Maybe that's unfair on my part, but I feel like it does a lot to filter for people who can actually walk the walk.",1244703502

I am 23 years old and graduated last year from U of Arizona. I currently run a technology consulting company called Omni Solutions. I do basic web development, marketing, computer repair/maintenance, and other tech consulting. Its only me and when I get a big job I usually use elance, guru, or odesk to outsource the work.<p>But I hate it.. really, really hate it. Omni is just for spending money (while I live with my new roomates -mom and dad) and try pursuing the startup life.  All I want to do is start a startup...in fact start a lot of startups.<p>I have created some basic sites using my limited skills in HTML and CSS (I have never programmed PHP, Java, ASP, etc). I have created a similar service to HARO with better matching and no media filtering (called findasource.org) and I am currently developing a craigslist style site dedicated to bartering locally.<p>But I am really looking for a local hacker to bounce ideas off of and start some businesses together.<p>I have read almost all of Paul's essays and one thing that sticks out is how hard it is to find a tech co-founder (especially when you are not in one of those tech hub cities). But I thought I might shout out my request to HN in the hopes that someone responds.<p>If you would like to talk - email, phone, beer, coffee, lunch (I'll buy), my email is<p>bryan (and then the at sign) myomnisolutions.com.<p>And if you have any suggestions for me to find a tech co-founder in LA, that would be great too.

Critical thinking and creativity tend to be tolerated at best, punished at worst.<p>But difficult for difficult? Maybe it's because challenges can stimulate you to find new ways there. I like playing the highest difficult levels of Civilization IV - itself one of the hardest and most complex games ever made - because it forces you to keep re-examining and questioning your assumptions. Strategies that work on the lower levels get you stomped on upper levels, so you're forced to adjust to a whole new style of play and find solutions you never even thought about.

It's not that a more sluggish site would cause me to abandon a purchase midway in the purchasing process, but it's rather that I might get annoyed at the sluggishness while browsing and postpone my purchase or take it elsewhere, where I can browse the available products at my leisure.<p>I think that is what they mean, but if the number is just based on assumptions about who <i>intends</i> to make a purchase, that also means the number is highly disputable. However, I think Amazon has enough data available to simply correlate response times with sales rates over a statistically signifcant period and statistically signifcant amount of sales.

The reality elsewhere is that a company needs people with all kinds of ability - they need the reliable but unimaginative person (let's call them the plodder programmer) that will come in and tie up all the lose ends that the hero programmer left behind before they got distracted by the latest shiny. The hard truth is the hero programmer will get paid much <i>much</i> more than the plodder, for obvious reasons. If the hero goes around telling everybody what they get, that is demoralising to the plodders - it just rubs their face into it, because they will never be the hero. But they can offer a company years of valuable service and dedicated work. As a geek herder, just because my HPs are <i>worth</i> more, it doesn't mean I <i>value</i> my plodders less.<p>So I would prefer not to discuss renumeration, though in my world that would be done out of politeness rather than contractually enforced.",1240465135

The direct payoff of humour is pleasure, with insight being of a different quality. There's more variety at Slashdot, and people can be more of themselves, for better and worse, and the modding style and layout promotes that diversity. Here, people downmod anything that doesn't add value to the discussion (or strongly opposes one's point-of-view) because you have to look at it, but on Slashdot, participation has it's own inherent value because of the filter.<p>Furthermore, if people here were identified by their real names, can you imagine how straight-jacketed most would feel, not wanting to be perceived as weird or 'funny' at any point?<p>Just takin' a stab.",1240464521

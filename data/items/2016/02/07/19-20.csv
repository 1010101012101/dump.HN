That&#x27;s part of the reason <i>why</i> they occur.\n(part of the explanation is straightforward: people are less likely to borrow if they think that problems in the economy might make repayment difficult, and optimism/pessimism about the future tends to be shared by large proportions of the population.

11054498,comment,11034007,11045805,0,0,dhj,,,"I agree that some form of evolutionary algorithm will be our path to intelligent software (or a component of it).  However, as genetic algorithms are currently implemented I would say the following analogy holds neural_net:brain::evolutionary_algorithm:evolution ...<p>In other words GAs/EAs are a simplistic and minimal scratching of the surface compared to the complexity we see in nature.  The problem is two fold:  1) we guide the evolution with specific artificial goals (get a high score for instance) 2) the ideal &quot;DNA&quot; of a genetic algorithm is undefined.<p>In evolution we know post-hoc that DNA is at least good enough (if not ideal) for the building blocks.  However, we have had very little success with identifying the DNA for genetic algorithms.  If we make it commands or function sets we end up with divergence (results get worse or stay the same per iteration rather than better).  The most successful GAs are where the DNA components have been customized to a specific problem domain.<p>Regarding the target goal selection that is a major field of study itself with reinforcement learning.  What is the best way to identify reward?  In nature it is simple -- survival.  In the computer it is artificial in some way.  Survival is an attribute or dynamic interaction selected by the programmer.<p>I believe that multiple algorithmic techniques will come together in a final solution (GA, NN, SVM, MCMC, kmeans, etc). So GA is still part of a large and difficult algorithmic challenge rather than a well defined solution.  The algorithmic challenge is definitely non-exponential -- there are breakthroughs that could happen next year or in 100 years.<p>The bandwidth issue is the main reason I would put AGI at 2045-2065 (closer to 2065), but with the algorithmic issue I would put it post 2065 (in other words, far enough out that 50 years from now it could still be 50 years out).  Regardless of the timeframe, it is a fascinating subject and I do think we will get there eventually, but I wouldn&#x27;t put the algorithmic level closer than 50 years out until we get a good dog, mouse or even worm (c.elegans) level of intelligence programmed in software or robots.",1454874984

The big political parties spend literally half a billion dollars a year on advertising. If they find a photo good enough to go on the front page of their website, they are <i>perfectly</i> willing to make that photographer&#x27;s year, and they&#x27;re not going to skimp on something that important. There&#x27;s no undercutting going on here - they decided that this guy&#x27;s photographs were the best options. Maybe it&#x27;s because the marginal value of a higher-quality photograph is not worth the money for some reason, in which case political photography as a business is doomed. Maybe it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s not making technically great photographs but is somehow better at political photographs. Maybe it&#x27;s because the licensing is a bureaucratic nightmare and the cost to a party of using a professional photograph is 90% the manpower required to deal with it costing <i>any money whatsoever</i>.

D can even catch C++ exceptions.<p>It&#x27;s not a near-perfect C++ interface, because D can&#x27;t instantiate C++ templates on its own.<p>> First of all, C++ cannot be obsoleted by rust, it&#x27;s economically impossible.<p>Rust can make C++ obsolete in a technical sense. But I agree of course that C++ is immortal.<p>> For example, it&#x27;s trivial to write a low overhead pointer that can&#x27;t dangle, throws an exception on nullptr deference, and that safely points to an object it doesn&#x27;t own (even if that object is its owner)<p>Wrong. You can&#x27;t write a pointer that can&#x27;t dangle in C++. Think iterator invalidation, &quot;this&quot; invalidation, etc. I&#x27;ve given innumerable code samples to prove this in the past.<p>It&#x27;s hard to argue about this abstractly, so let&#x27;s do this.

You also can&#x27;t do it in C++.<p>C++ is good at making you <i>think</i> that you&#x27;re using pointers that can&#x27;t dangle, as evidenced by posts like yours. It&#x27;s not good at <i>actually</i> preventing things like use-after-free.<p>> - template meta-programming feels like a different language, it&#x27;s dynamic, functional, and the difference is refreshing. I like the mental switch you have to do to go from writing a C++ template to writing a C++ model.<p>I much prefer the static approach of Rust&#x27;s generics to the untyped templates of C++--the fact that templates feel like a different language is a disadvantage in my view--but this is a huge tradeoff and it largely comes down to taste. This is unlike the memory safety guarantees of Rust pointers, which are <i>not</i> a matter of taste; safety is a formal property that C++ references simply do not satisfy and cannot satisfy no matter what.",1454874597

The code is written a certain way, the infrastructure works a certain way, the processes and culture are a certain way, because they have evolved over time and often at great cost.  Changing them is not easy, and not to be undertaken lightly.  That doesn&#x27;t mean e.g. that moving to GitHub is absolutely verboten, but the gain in convenience for (some) users might be offset by a <i>total stoppage of development</i> during the transition.  Then there&#x27;s likely to be a general slowdown for a while as new secondary issues are found and addressed, as current developers make mistakes with the new processes, etc.  If the same users who demand that change are also demanding that their favorite features be implemented (by someone else) right away, they&#x27;re putting the developers in an impossible situation.  Nobody appreciates that.  There always seem to be some users with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement, and that can utterly ruin a project for everyone including the other users.<p>That said, I have to take serious issue with one point.<p>> We write software.

Developers don&#x27;t have to become experts in every packaging system or its rules, but they can&#x27;t shirk all responsibility for packaging either.  They need to work <i>with</i> package maintainers, fixing (and not re-creating) problems that make packaging difficult.  Anyone who can&#x27;t do that, or isn&#x27;t willing to, can&#x27;t claim to have &quot;learned all they can&quot; about software delivery, as I see in the first paragraph of the other Taskwarrior article posted today.

There are many more to chose from - Openmusic, even Manx, a Forth system. I prefer to have more control, and both Sonic Pi and Overtone are wrappers for Super Collider. In Extempore you can create new ugens, whereas in Overtone and SonicPi I believe you only have available what&#x27;s provided for in Super Collider. Granted there is plenty enough for 99% of people looking to livecode. I am biased towards Extempore because I like Lisp, it does both visuals, music, &#x27;cyberphysical&#x27; programming, and it was truly built from the ground up for livecoding [1]. I am very excited about xtlang as a general purpose programming language outside of livecoding. I believe Extempore is being courted by the HPC crowd too after Ben Swift&#x27;s and Andrew&#x27;s work on it. AFAIK, Overtone is Clojure atop Super Collider, and Sonic Pi is Ruby atop Super Collider. They have nice interfaces, and you can do visuals in Overtone with Shadertone, a sort of ShaderToy for Overtone. I am not a Ruby fan however, and I prefer a more traditional Lisp or Scheme to Clojure. If I need functional programming in a Lisp, I like Shen, but nobody has ported a livecoding environment to it. Take a look at Andrew Sorensen here to see how Extempore can be applied to Western Music in action[2]. It has a Scheme language, and a c-like language called xtlang. It can be used for other things besides livecoding too. I started with Fluxus, but on Windows it doesn&#x27;t support livecoding audio, only livecoding visuals to the audio stream you feed it. GRACE [3] is very easy to start with, and complete with built-in tutorials. It is Scheme-based, but has a more generic language called SAL. It is crossplatform, and comes packaged as one self-contained file to download and execute. It is the quickest to start with in my opinion. Jason Levine has ported the code from Daniel Shiffman&#x27;s book, The Nature of Code book to Extempore&#x27;s xtlang [4]. A great way to learn Extempore.<p>Livecoding seems to be growing more and more with a lot of hardware toys to go along with it.

Neither one of those really conducive for for what I would consider a prerequisite for real learning: An environment of exploration and curiosity.<p>But, I do disagree about teachers &quot;giving passion&quot;; I don&#x27;t think thats possible. I think its possible for a good teacher, at the right time, to ignite a students curiosity in a subject. But that spark _has_ to come from the student, not the teacher. I don&#x27;t care how passionate you are as a teacher, if the student doesn&#x27;t give a shit, it&#x27;s not happening. It&#x27;s the teacher&#x27;s job to fan it into flames of mastery, not create the initial sparks of interest. Although, it seems that most of the time these days, it&#x27;s the teachers job to quell the sparks of interest from students and get them &quot;back on topic&quot;.<p>But even still, as a teacher, I think you have to accept that making that impact is not going to happen to 100% of the students in the class, probably not even 25%. And it&#x27;s questionable if the teacher really had all that much to do with it; would the student have sought out information on their own outside of the context of the classroom? Hopefully... Would they have found their own set of teachers, mentors, resources to express the thing burning a hole in their head? Again, hopefully. Would it have taken them longer to do those things? Sure.<p>I think, as a teacher, the hardest thing to do is not to take too much credit for the accomplishments of your students.

I got extremely addicted to using the moral equivalent of TCL&#x27;s uplevel, inspect.currentframe(-...), to build interfaces in Python where I don&#x27;t have to pull out parameters. My &quot;cyql&quot; interface (which is barely anything, really: just a thin wrapper for psycopg2, which is itself excellent; in Clojure I wrap a slightly modified copy of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to provide an even better implementation that does &quot;compile&quot;-time type SQL statement verification), uses this to allow me to remove what feels like <i>all</i> of the boilerplate.<p><a href=""http://gitweb.saurik.com/cyql.git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitweb.saurik.com/cyql.git</a><p>In addition to .run (which returns the number of affected rows) and .all (which returns an array of ordered dicts?), I have .has (which returns a bool and wraps an exists query), .gen (which returns a generator and iterates a cursor), and .one (which verifies you only got back a single row and returns just that row). I also have easy support for transactions (either on an existing connection or in one line as part of making a connection), easily turning off synchronous commit (for log tables), and I carefully manage autocommit to make certain that I am using the minimum number of possible SQL statements to the server (which I care about a lot).<p><a href=""http://gitweb.saurik.com/cyql.git/blob/HEAD:/__init__.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitweb.saurik.com/cyql.git/blob/HEAD:/__init__.py</a><p>That said, I agree with the post by masklinn below: neither the linked library nor my library are solving problems that I believe are worth inheriting code from someone else over. There is some basic configuration of psycopg2 which is necessary, but the underlying library itself is what works here. I have spent over a decade thinking about how I like to build SQL interfaces, and have now implemented a similar interface for myself in numerous languages, each time evolving the design slightly (and sometimes having enough of an epiphany that I go back and retrofit some of the older ones), but it ends up being built around the way I think about stuff.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11053877"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11053877</a><p>And that also means that as I learn more and &quot;level up&quot;, I start making different decisions. My implementation in Clojure stresses stored procedures a lot more, as while it took me a long time to really figure out how to use them in my workflow, I now see them as exceedingly correct and feel a lot of the code I&#x27;ve written in the past where I had tons of free statements is essentially &quot;what I wrote from back when I didn&#x27;t know how to use the database to organize my API layer&quot; (though I still haven&#x27;t worked out some of the tooling around shifting to stored procedures, and have been distracted with other higher-level problems the last couple years).<p>Essentially, I&#x27;m arguing that the same will happen to you. Put differently: some problems are hard, and some problems are easy; I find a lot of libraries that seem to be solving easy problems that new developers think are hard, and a lot of libraries that pretend to solve a hard problem, but only because the problem looked easy and the result doesn&#x27;t actually work (such as the PostgreSQL drivers that were available in Ruby for a long time, which were all unusably bad).

But more money has been put into maintenance and replacement.<p>For this issue specifically, part of the problem is that the U.S. kept installing lead pipes through much of the 20th century, and as a result is saddled with a lot of them. Flint&#x27;s lead pipes aren&#x27;t even particularly old, most dating to its big population/construction boom of the 1920s-40s. That is late enough that concerns were already pretty widespread by then, e.g. Helsinki decided to phase out lead pipes during the 1890s. I can&#x27;t seem to find a date for when the U.S. as a whole phased out lead pipes, but I do find that NYC stopped new installations in only 1961, so it seems to have been quite late.",1454871947

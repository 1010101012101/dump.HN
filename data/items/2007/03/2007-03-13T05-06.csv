3836,comment,3820,3835,0,0,pg,,,"Actually the scalability of YC is a fascinating question.  As hackers we're always thinking about that.  And of course as hackers we have ideas about how to do it.  We've been gradually growing the number of startups in each batch.  But we often speculate about what we'd have to do to fund, say, 1000 startups per year.  There has to be some way to do it.  Whatever the answer is, it would be something to see, wouldn't it?",1173763187
3835,comment,3820,3821,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Two hypotheses:<p>1.) Y Combinator's advice and connections are a limited resource. There are only so many phone calls their partners can make in a day. Y Combinator's business is not scalable unless they generate more y combinators.<p>2.) Y Combinator's application process allows them to invest in startups that are most likely to succeed. If they spread their resources around a larger base of companies, they would be investing in startups less likely to success. With more failures, their return on investment would fall, not rise.",1173762873
3834,comment,3820,3821,0,0,pg,,,"Because (a) putting our own money in is a test of our commitment and forces us to pay attention, and (b) a lot of the founders would be distracted by money issues and wouldn't be able to focus on their startups.",1173762709
3833,comment,3820,3825,0,0,pg,,,"That's exactly how we look at it: the most important thing we offer is advice and connections, and the money is just to pay your living expenses so that you can focus entirely on the startup for long enough to get it properly launched.<p>It always annoys us when people say YC is a ripoff because we want an avg of 6% of a co for $15-20k.  One reason we don't argue (much) with people who say that is that we treat the question as a sort of preliminary IQ test in the application process.",1173762585

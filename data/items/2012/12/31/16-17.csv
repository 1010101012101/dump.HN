I visit more or less daily too; for me it's more about the quality of the content than the uniqueness, since there's little overlap between who I follow on each. I only visit Facebook maybe once a week and Twitter once a month or so.<p>For me, G+ is where I post things I find interesting, usually links and thoughts to a relatively limited audience of real-life friends and acquaintances, and sometimes tech-related thoughts to my Hackers circle.<p>At this point I only use FB for a) chatting with people whose phone number / email address I don't have, and b) to keep in touch with and get updates from more distant family/friends (e.g. ""that waitress I worked with a few years ago got engaged-- best wishes!"", ""it's my buddy's college roommate's birthday-- let's go get a beer in Portland sometime this summer!"")<p>And I only use Twitter to read jokes from wannabe comedians and publicly bitch about corporations...",1356973130

Not so at 12 or more.<p>I hope it's not the case, but I wonder whether there are so few people that pay for movies at <i>any</i> price that the studios have concluded it's just not worth it, and so keep the higher prices. Or, alternatively, there are enough people that <i>do</i> buy at the 12 point, again not making it worth the time to lower the price.<p>In conclusion: trying to work out pricing points hurts my head.",1356973079

Trust me, you should quit Facebook, if you are-<p>1) Working on a product/idea/startup<p>2)Trying to be more productive<p>3)Wanting to spend some time with REAL people<p>This advice is from a fellow HN member who fell for the addiction and would update an average of 1 status per day.<p>BEFORE you quit Facebook, you need to find the <i>pointers</i> that lead you to it.<p>Pointer #1 - Frequently visited links<p>If you are on Chrome (or Firefox or Opera or IE), find out a way to delete the Facebook shortcut that appears the moment you open a new tab. By doing this, you will be able to reduce approx. 60% of your urge to use the service. Meaning, if you thought about visiting facebook 100 times on an average a day, you would visit it only 40 times (previously you visited it all the 100 times).<p>What you're doing here is basically making it difficult (or rather creating a tiny hurdle or bad user experience) such that you would have time to think twice before you visit the service.<p>Pointer #2 - Deactivate your facebook account temporarily<p>(Under Account->Security->Deactivate->This is temporary, I'll be back)<p>This way, even if you typed www.facebook.com in your address bar, you would be taken to the login page (or homepage) instead of being taken directly to your feed (your worst enemy!). since there's nothing engaging about the homepage nor the login page, you would feel hesitant to login (with due course of time) and you would come back to doing whatever you were doing before. Promise yourself that you will spend no longer than 2 seconds on the login page.<p>You will be surprised, how such a tiny action could help you overcome this addiction for a LONG period of time.<p>NOW. Wait for about 3-4 days. The temptation to login would have gone, but not completely. So, to erase it completely, login again AFTER 4-5 days. Look at your feed. By now, you would start to feel it's become (sort of) irrelevant since you were no longer staying updated with it. You will also have NO notifications. Generally, the motivation to login is to look at that tiny red piece of notification icon. But now that that is gone, you will feel 'disappointed' (I swear you will) and you will lose interest in the service. Now deactivate again. Login after a good 10-12 days. Repeat this and rinse. But increase the time period from 10 days to 20 days and keep on increasing. In a matter of 1-2 months, you would have learnt to ignore the service and master yourself. Just keep this in mind, whenever you login to the service, promise yourself not to spend more than 5 mins. If you do so, 'punish' yourself by de-activating your account and not logging into the service for a couple of days.<p>Hope this helps! It worked well for me :D<p>Cheers!",1356972848

4989810,comment,4989187,4989418,6,0,bradleyland,,,"> One more note. Every day there are millions of passenger miles flown on airlines. Surely the law of large numbers says that we're already performing an experiment on electronic device radiation and the cockpit.<p>I couldn't agree with this more. At one point, I was flying very frequently for work, and I used to make a hobby out of watching to see what people did with their electronics when prepping for take-off. Laptops usually got turned off, but rarely did I see someone turn their phone off completely. I'd see a lot of people switch to airplane mode, then put their phone to sleep (a short press on a button). I'd even see a lot of people who simply put their phones on silent (usually when I'm sitting next to them; this is difficult to observe from a distance). Behavior on landing is pretty telling as well. When you see people texting and making calls immediately after landing, you know that their phones weren't off completely. When you watch the person next to you take out their phone and begin texting immediately, you know that the phone wasn't even put in to airplane mode.<p>These scenarios were far more common than observing someone actually power down/up a device.<p>I'd imagine that it is possible to get an estimate of the number of RF emitting devices within range. I really wish the FAA would do a study of what <i>actually</i> happens on planes, rather than what the rules say <i>should</i> happen on planes, because I suspect the results will be much different than they expect.",1356972726

Pretty much, you can use a $75 Android tablet to control an embedded device and drive the user interface. iPads are, frankly, a bit too expensive for most hardware applications.<p>If I had the energy, I would champion an open-source project for niche hobbyists who want to program a particular type of hardware (assuming their particular hardware has some kind of serial/network relatively-open, documented interface - something like ZigBee but less complicated maybe) but aren't necessarily programmers. Build the project such that the UI and hardware control layer run on Android - and can be abstracted out from the actual hardware later.

God will not fill up your energy when your climbing those hills nor will he fill up your stomach whenever you want. You have to do that, because <i>THAT</i> is real.<p>Yes, we live mostly by the ego. So it is and we continue forward finding happiness here and there (sometimes all over - the universe to me is far more beautiful than the notion of a vengeful, side-taking god), just 'living' the human experience. People let 'god' ruin that, always have, (sadly) always will.<p>Cycling helps us produce endorphins. If our body holds out and we don't feel like puking after that one or many hills, we can feel elated. That's brain chemistry. There's no magic switches and god has nothing to do with any of that. He saves no one from accidents, stops no wars, does not magically wave his hand/wand and turn that homeless guy into a 'cured' millionaire. Just like he will not magically lift me up so I can fly thru the air to the top of a nasty hill.<p>No, he's definitely not real, nor does he need to be. When I was young and realized organized religion was a sham, a veil was lifted over my eyes. Human existence has so much beauty (and sure, plenty of pain and suffering, just ask the Buddha) and I'm just happy being a part of that. I only have one shot to experience all of it. So, for me, cycling is a part of that beauty, just like the OP said. Stop robbing everyone of their experiences with beauty just because you believe in a hypothetical, invisible, vengeful, biased, super being. Leave us mortals who have to deal with reality every day to enjoy our postings in peace.<p>Thank you.<p>(edited for typos)",1356972417

Start with your friends/linked in contacts and ask them if they can refer to some people in <industry>. Then ask these people if they can refer other people too.<p>Otherwise, it's kind of difficult to cold call or cold email these people and have them agree to meet. I tried cold calling for a software product of mine (filesharing for small companies, in France) and it was quite difficult, especially considering I don't have a sales background. When you say ""Mr X told me you could be interested"" you get an almost-guaranteed meet.<p>Another way to do it if you picked an audience who's internet-savvy is to analyze conversations you find in forums, and find evidence of problems people have (that's the approach that Amy Hoy recommends in her online class 30x500), and create educational content for them: ebooks, screenscasts, podcasts, blog posts etc. as far as I understand, it's not exactly customer development though, as it doesn't get you in face of customers.

What tutorials do is teach you a few interesting things, that cause you to become more interested, and then you want to learn more.  If books started off with an interesting tutorial up front, more people would want to read them, but they typically start with very elementary things that bore the readers before they get to the ""good stuff.""

4989656,comment,4988592,4988828,3,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Once again we see the entitlement attitude used to defend piracy.<p>So first off, iDevices aren't made for hackers. They're made for consumers. The amount of people who need a root shell on their iPhone is probably about the same amount of people who will post in this thread saying they need a root shell (I'm exaggerating but it's a seriously small number).<p>There are free apps that let you SSH into servers already on the app store. If one doesn't suit you there's always the option of creating one. Too expensive? Then submit it to one of the stores for Jailbroken iPhones. They'll probably be more interested in it than the regular App Store using population anyway.<p>Trying out apps before you buy one is a really great idea and I wish it was possible with iOS apps. I get people using Hackulous and such to try apps before they buy but what I don't buy into is this idea that there's a huge population of iOS users who are using Jailbroken phones and apps to ""try before you buy"". I don't have solid numbers and I doubt anyone really does but experience and observation tell me that the amount of people who Jailbreak a phone just to try before you buy is incredibly low with the majority just trying and never buying. I myself Jailbroke my first generation iPhone when I first got it. You know what I did with it? Totally got a bunch of paid apps for free with intention of never paying for them. I was poor and even $0.99 was too much for me. I was an asshole and I know this. I haven't done that since 2008 or so though.<p>Now, when you say ""Besides, there are poor ppl out there with iDevices"" my mind gets kind of boggled. How in the hell are poor people getting iDevices if they're so poor? If they can afford even the subsidized iPhone or the low-end iPod then you'd think an app that costs $0.99 - $2.99 wouldn't be all that much. But even if we assume this is a valid reason (excuse is the word I'd use personally) does being poor entitle you to goods at a lower cost or free? I've been poor. I know what poor is better than most and I can say that looking back I wasn't <i>so poor</i> that I couldn't afford iOS apps. I was just incredibly cheap as a result of how poor I was. That $1 - $5 was just going to get pissed away on something equally stupid and quickly squandered like a pack of cigarrettes. I feel for the poor people but I can't get behind the idea that it's alright to pirate software because you can't afford it. The old ""they wouldn't buy it anyway"" argument is so lame. If they wouldn't buy it anyway then they shouldn't have it anyway and maybe if they couldn't circumvent the payment process they'd actually give saving up for whatever ""they"" want to pirate the ol' college try.<p>Pirating helps people participate in society you say? Depends on your definition of participate. If it means they get to use a copy of Photoshop for free rather than something cheaper that they paid for that's really not good participation. Again, I've been on the shit-end of poor and I was able to participate as a creator without piracy. Yes, I did do it but there was nothing stopping me from participating with what I had available. I feel like this whole line of thought comes from this weird idea that many young people, my peers (I'm only 26), have these days that somehow we're somehow entitled to start out at the top. That we're too good to ""slum it"" and work our way up. Participating in society could mean doing the ethical thing and paying for the goods you use. That's good participation the way I see it.<p>So iMacs are more expensive overseas. That sucks. It really does. But I doubt it's some conspiracy to empty the pockets of European Mac users. That's life, man. Some things suck but you just do what you gotta do to make it.",1356969733

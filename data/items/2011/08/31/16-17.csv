It's incredibly exhilarating. Also a bit scary. Everything is on me. It can be stressful, but I don't think I could go back to the old way.<p>Second, when people realize it's just me behind the scenes, they don't take the app as seriously. I don't try to hide it. Kind of similar to how tech bloggers don't take you seriously unless you have funding. (But that's a different topic.)<p>Third, it's tough to get context or a neutral perspective. You're so close to it that seeing where you go wrong can be difficult. This is why I disagree with point #2 in the post. I worked on an app for a year and didn't realize it was a lost cause.

You can even store events in a...wait for it... SQL database.  I have built numerous systems backed by SQL databases that have complete history retention.  Answering questions like 'who had id 'X' on this date 3 years ago' are easily solvable with basic standard sql.<p>I certainly don't believe SQL databases are perfect or the tool for every job, but in many cases they work just fine until you get into very large datasets.

2946410,comment,2946152,2946353,3,0,pbh,,,"1) There seem to be two things that impact the number of rounds necessary, your description and how many names are taken in that area.  With the same description, usually one or two rounds is sufficient to see how well you're going to do (sometimes you'll get a bad batch of workers, but one or two rounds is usually enough to smooth the variance).  However, if you're changing little things it might go longer.  For example, if I was to do more rounds, I'd probably add something to the DebtEye description to ask for more ""safe sounding"" words, and less sort of sleazy words (e.g., ""ez"" or ""instant"").<p>2) $5 is below cost, our twin goals for the moment are to gather more data about what sorts of names we can do well on and to get our name out there.  We'll probably do a survey or something later of real buyers to see what the actual price should be.  There's also some raw-ness to the results right now (e.g., you'll get 2 or 3 good results with 47 bad results) so we're keeping the price relatively low until we have better automated filtering.<p>3) Unfortunately, when we were just starting out we didn't have Domain Refinery (and a naive implementation doesn't work terribly well for reasons I won't go into).  As a result, we did the days of brainstorming followed by purchasing an overpriced name route.  However, we've since used Domain Refinery for our naming, and in fact, Domain Refinery is named using itself.  The top three names for what is now the Domain Refinery were domainrefinery.com, nolongernameless.com, and brainstormdomains.com.  Ultimately, we liked domainrefinery.com best because it signaled the refinement aspect that we wanted to contrast against competitors.<p>(I'm one of the co-founders.)",1314809922

I actually like the ugly Motion-X toggle switches compared to the IOS toggles which are a bit confusing I find - I can immediately see what is active / selected on the motion-X screen but on his examples of the correct"" design I couldn't immediately work out what is selected/active.

He states<p>""On average, only 3% of people who have downloaded an app use it after 30 days. Why? Because the majority of iPhone apps dont make any sense to users.""<p>But where is the evidence for this? He shows App usage over time graphs which don't separate between ""over-designed"" and ""correctly designed apps"" and then goes on to make an unwarranted assertion that the fall off is due users not understanding how to use the apps! How about the utility value of the apps not being enough or users getting bored with their $0.99 fun purchase ?<p>Lastly, if you go to the author's web site. You'll see he's designed an app for a pizza company. I downloaded it and it's beautiful (in fact I fancy a pizza now)! However, It does not use ANY standard IOS controls and has gone for a very nice custom dedicated UI!<p>His article spends a lot of time basically saying that the standard UI should be used but as his own app demonstrates there are cases where a custom UI is appropriate.

There are three alternatives (that come to mind) to patents:<p>1) Make all information freely accessible to anyone. This is the one we'd all like everyone to do. However, there's very little (economic) incentive to innovate when you do all of the heavy thinking and anyone else can just come along and beat you to the implementation.<p>2) Stop innovating. If you can't protect your ideas, you might as well just stop trying.<p>3) Hide your information. Only you can benefit from the information if no one else knows about it. (You can't license information and keep it a secret at the same time!) There are laws to help protect you, but you also have to do a lot of work to protect yourself. You can also keep your information secret indefinitely.<p>By filing a patent, you're telling the world how to do something (allegedly) new. In 20 years, (or longer/shorter, depending on the country) everyone is freely able to use the idea.",1314809673

There are already companies working on this in the health and security sectors, but i would like to produce input devices and sensors that can talk with each other and with the web to enable a range of flexible and creative applications beyond even what we might imagine (i'm an infrastructure guy, meaning i like to make tools and open up new possibilities). I'd also like to build a well-designed software suite or API which would support these devices.  \nWe would probably start with some simple mobile apps which would mimic hardware and allow us to prototype quickly, and perform user research. Then build arduino-based hardware prototypes, before securing future funding to go into real production. I can get a lot more specific about this idea and why there is massive potential, when we talk, and i have already built one prototype mobile app.<p>another idea is for a physical mail version of twitter, in which you enter your mailing address and then you ""follow"" people, which would allow them to send you physical mail. think: newsletters, short stories, photographs, special news content, coupons, etc. more on this if you want to discuss. it could cost money to follow some people if they want to pass on the cost of printing to their followers. Our company could handle the printing and shipping of content to followers.<p>A little about me:<p>I am 25, trained as an interaction designer, visual artist, and cognitive scientist. I taught myself to hack web apps so i could make 'real' stuff myself. I founded Social Print Studio last year, which gave me experience in the start-up game: running a company day to day, designing, hacking, hiring, marketing, writing/presenting, pitching to companies + investors, customer service, etc. I'm ready to start something new, ideally with a good hardworking team. I want to design and build with quality, and I care deeply about the world and creating meaningful, valuable things/experiences.<p>I'm looking to meet hardware/software hackers who are passionate, self-motivated and have real experience making things happen.

In my experience, this holds 100% of the time, on Windows.<p>For Python, I have, afaik, 3 (and a half) options:<p>1) Use something called ""easy_install"". Installing ""easy_install"" is not at all easy, which means that the entire experience is somewhat, well, ironic.<p>1b) Something with ""egg files"". I never quite understood what these are or how to use them, but I believe they are somehow related.<p>2) Use something called ""pip"". If ""pip"" knows your lib, then all is fine, but if not, things are bad. Also, there are different versions of pip for different ""builds"" of Python, and I do not know which to use. Tools seem not to be able to figure this out for me. In at least one case I ended up having multiple versions of pip, installed through different means, because the one that came with Python (which afair is the case) was not the right pip version.<p>3) Google for the library to discover that there is an installer for it, instead of using one of the package manager thingos mentioned above.<p>Trying to install trac on windows, I had to use all 3 of the above options (not 1b). I forgot what for what, but it wasn't trivial.<p>As you can see for my story, which is probably full of incorrect details, I'm not an expert.

I know MS SQL Server best so can't speak in detail for others, but the community around that is certainly very substantial. Library support, well, doesn't work quite the same way (yet!) but there's plenty of libraries of code samples available for adapting. Vendor lock-in is a tricky one; by the time you've got to a certain scale of application I tend to think you're programming as much to the API (whether it's the provider's standard API or your own specific API layered over the underlying platform) as to the official 'language'; lock-in can creep up surprisingly easily. Facebook avoided vendor lock-in by writing in open PHP and have since had to write their own PHP compiler to get the performance they needed from the solution they were locked in to.<p>A former employer used to bulk process EDI order lines in very large quantities. Deduplicating them, dynamically rebatching them according to what was available and what wasn't, updating orders with newer product where customer had specified 'this or better', cross-referencing against multi million row datasets of cataloguing and tagging information to identify how to handle the item. It was a monster; I hate to think about the volumes of data that touched each batch, and with processing orders it absolutely had to have transactional integrity. And yet, written in SQL and running on a very average commodity server, it was actually very fast. The data never left the server until it was ready to do so and all the loads stayed happily internal. The implications of trying to implement it on a NoDB solution - the volumes of data being passed around, the amount of data specific library code the DBMS provides but the underlying language doesn't which would need reading..... It's not pretty.<p>I don't maintain SQL is the perfect language for everything, that's patently silly. But I do maintain it's a <i>lot</i> more powerful (and with good performance and reliability) than it's given credit for on some very complex operations, and that a lot the reasons people prefer to work in alternatives boil down to lack of understanding. A little learning of what a modern DBMS is capable of can reap huge rewards of saving work in the 'real programming language', as you put it.",1314809186

JS's semantics require that ints overflow into doubles, for example, meaning that a conservative type inference engine would have to assume every number can potentially be a double. This is too imprecise to be useful, so the inference engine speculates. If the engine guesses wrong, the compiler must not only recompile the function under the new assumptions but also (since this is a global analysis) potentially update <i>every other function</i> that the function called.<p>Finally, the presence of eval() and the like mean that almost no inference can be totally sound, requiring even more dynamic checks.<p>There's a reason that (despite what some others are saying in this thread) V8 and Chakra haven't done this yet: it takes a long time to get right.",1314808211

This grows tiring, though, because such polemic tends to be free of fidelity.<p>Andy tells us that he'll never hire people who are out-of-shape because they have character flaws. He publicly ""redesigns"" websites, making bold, unsubstantiated claims, free of any understanding of the functional design requirements. Then, he puts antagonistic bunk like this out there.<p>The problem with the post linked here, is that it presents opinion as dogmatic fact, when many strong arguments can be made for another approach. Meanwhile, this notion is, in my mind, quite dangerous to young designers who are already trying to learn too many things.<p>I don't hire designers who write code. I hire designers, developers, and strategists who work well together. They all work, literally, next to one another.<p>By this, I mean that we don't pocket designers in one corner and developers into another, like some agencies do. Instead, a designer sits next to a strategist, who sits next to a developer, and so on. By doing so, each of the professionals we've hired learns why their colleagues' concerns matter. Meanwhile, by allowing each to be concentrate on their respective craft, we do better work for our clients.<p>For the record, I think it's great if you're a designer who can write a little code. That being said, I think it's much more important if you can communicate well, write effective briefs, build good wireframes, think about big picture strategic concerns, and all kinds of other stuff.<p>Then of course, I've played right into Andy's game.

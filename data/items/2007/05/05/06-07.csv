If you aren't going to be able to take up the Luxembourg market without paying particular attention to the cultural and linguistic peculiarities of Luxembourg (hint: 3 languages), then the conclusion for many companies is going to be that it's not worth worrying about Luxembourg at all. Then again, if <i>nobody</i> worries about Luxembourg, that opens up a decent opportunity for somebody to just copy a bunch of existing ideas for the Luxembourg market. And that's why people are looking for ways to overcome the problem of cultural fragmentation and make it profitable, even for a small company, to target the European market.",1178347431

At the same time with funding what would take me 20 years working alone could be accomplished in 2 years with say at least 20 programmers and some office space. \nIn regards to whether it would be a product someone would buy it would be for companies that have programmers. The whole point is speeding up software development. It would make it possible to develop software in months rather than in years. \nI think that the empitus for the idea first occurred to me when I had to make a symbolic link at Schwab and no one at Schwab knew how Schwab wrote symoblic links except for one guy and he was in vacation in Lousiana. I decided that there needed to be a better way of 'talking to the machine"" with a smarter programming language. It would definitely make money. You could do a month's worth or programming in a day. What's not to like?",1178347396

Technical yes but you will need someone who can find out every single competitor out there and find a way to make your product better.  <p>2.In addition, you need to be able to find and talk to users who are using your competitor's product to find out what they're complaining about so that you can make it better.<p>You're probably thinking ""a hacker"" can do that.  Ummmm..hackers have no problem talking to other hackers but how about talking to non-hackers?  In addition, you need to make sure that your user interface is idiot proof to someone who isn't a programmer. <p>Another example of why you need people who understand the industry or your users -<p>Example: Awhile back there was a debate I had with somoene, can't remember his name so I will call him Mr.Citrus. Anyways, I stopped responding because he was too stubborn.  Mr. C and his team are building a site that is a women-related site.    Mr.C says that he is going to take on Monopoly X by building site Y. However, after looking at site Y, I noticed that it offers nothing better than Monopoly X.  In addition, if Mr.C had people on his team who understood this industry or knew where to look or who to ask, he would have known some juicy gossip related to his competitor that would have assisted him to get acquired quicker or beat out his competitor. What kind of gossip can a non-hacker give him? Well things like:<p>1. Monopoly X has a partnership with several women magazines in which the editor of that magazine would never do an article who is a competitor of Monopoly X.  So that cuts out an avenue of obtaining users.<p>2. The recent acquisitions Monopoly X had acquired as well as the new venture Monopoly X had recently branched out too would provide a glimpse of where the competitor is heading and who/what he just bought.  It would have helped Mr. Citrus predict his competitor's next move<p>3. Understanding what Monopoly x is missing, and fill in that gap or void because currently, there is a HUGE chunk monopoly X is missing but because Mr. Citrus and his team compose of only hackers who are attempting to penetrate a women related industry, he doesn't see it.  And unfortunately, asking your sister or wife for their opinion isn't always helpful b/c if they're not into the whole web 2.0, kill your competitor attitude, they won't offer much opinion.<p>\nAnd that is why you would need a non-hacker...on your team...<p>Disclaimer: This does not apply to dimwitted, moronic non-hackers who have an idea but don't know the competitors or offer programmers suggestions, opinions, or even know how they can make it better or why something is better<p><p>",1178346133

19700,comment,19512,19602,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The interesting thing for me is that the K programs are fewer lines...a lot fewer.  9 in K vs. 96 in Perl in one example.  When one remembers that perl is historically the king of one-liners, this is pretty impressive.  I'd probably be willing to learn how to interpret line noise if I only have to parse 9 lines for every 96 I'm parsing now (I'm primarily a Perl programmer).  I, obviously, don't believe this is representative--a large number of programming tasks aren't reduce-able beyond a certain level.  But for a 50% LoC reduction, I might consider it.<p>There's a lot of other considerations, and right now Haskell and Erlang are leading my ""what'll my next back end projects use"" list (after Perl 6...which I'm getting excited about after seeing Audrey Tang's talk about it from a few days ago, as it appears it will fix every single major problem with Perl, by my reckoning)...but I'm not going to rule out a language merely because my first glance at it makes me uncomfortable or confused (if that were the case, I would have never used Perl, Python, Ruby, and I would be avoiding messing with Erlang and Haskell...I might have even continued trying to figure out Java, since it seemed comfortably familiar based on my C experience, but I believe that would have been a very bad instinct).",1178345141

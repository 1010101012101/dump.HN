The &quot;standard&quot; translations of Aristotle&#x27;s major works--particularly Metaphysics--by Sir David Ross are also heavily influenced by Ross&#x27; neo-Platonism, so they can be quite misleading given the number of gaps and ambiguities that need to be filled.<p>It is also worth remembering that we know today that Aristotle&#x27;s physics accurately describes human experience. If you inquire into the physical beliefs of non-physicist college students you will find they give accounts that are Aristotelian to the core. The degree to which Newtonian physics is bizarre, abstract and counter-intuitive is often forgotten by people who bash Aristotle. He was often wrong, but the problems he was working on were fiercely difficult, and the tools he had to bring to bear on them incredibly crude by modern standards.",1413683992

8476991,comment,8472157,8476786,0,0,graycat,,,"Thanks, I&#x27;m learning!<p>Finally it dawned on me, the G to D change
was while in D major and, thus, back to the
tonic!  So, there, in the next to last bar, 
right before the top of
the climax of the section, Bach touched on
the tonic again!  So, <i>artistically</i> this
tied the <i>motion</i> and <i>emotion</i> of the other
notes back to the tonic and not left partly
lost out in the ozone -- or some such.<p>This afternoon, I listened to the Heifetz
and Piatigorsky performance of the Andante
of the Brahms <i>Double Concerto</i>:  Finally it
dawned on me:  Brahms had an <i>abstraction</i> 
of some kind of speech, say, of just the 
<i>sound</i> of the speech, the sounds that 
conveyed the emotion without knowing the literal
words.  So, it sounded like speech, maybe like
speech in a foreign language where didn&#x27;t 
understand the literal meaning of the words
but, still, got much of the <i>emotional</i> 
expression.  It appears that you have a book
that expands on such a thing.<p>Edit:  Okay, at<p><a href=""http://www.nsi.edu/~ani/MLB_review_Psychomusicology_Sept_2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsi.edu/~ani/MLB_review_Psychomusicology_Sept_201...</a><p>I found a book review of<p>Aniruddh D. Patel.
<i>Music, Language, and the Brain</i>.<p>He&#x27;s deep into some apparently fairly speculative
research and makes me like more my little idea
that some of music is like listening to some 
passionate talking in a foreign language were 
know none of the words but, still, get the 
emotional content -- that is, the music and the
emotional content of the speech can be similar.<p>So, back to the opening cello solo of the
Brahms <i>Double</i>, we can imagine some 
passionate speaking where a person says
something, just a few words, then says it
again a little differently, then again with
a little different emphasis, then again 
using maybe different word order.  Well,
maybe 
that&#x27;s much of what Piatigorsky playing
what Brahms wrote is doing.<p>Or, back to the beginning of the D major
section of the Bach <i>Chaconne</i>, we have
<i>phrases</i><p>F# G E, F# G A D, E F# G F# E E A F#<p>[this example would be still more clear
with the actual music with the
note timings -- maybe the harmony
would also help!]  Here I am inserting
commas to separate what I am regarding
as the separate <i>phrases</i> repeating
the same basic emotional content.<p>So, an idea is that that music is 
like a speaker saying much the same
thought three times, each time
with mostly the same words and
in a similar but different way,
that is, with <i>variations</i>.<p>Why three times
with variations?  The speaker is
passionate and, maybe even, <i>pleading</i>,
and trying to get their meaning across
if not the first way then maybe in one
of the two other ways.  Besides, the third
way is more complete than the other two
and, even, with the rise to the A, has a point of
high emphasis and emotion.  Maybe.<p>See something similar at the beginning
of <i>Silent Night</i> where there are four
variations of basically the same
emotional expression.<p>I suspect that Bach and Mozart could 
&quot;search their feelings&quot; (<i>Star Wars</i>),
think of some corresponding speech,
hear the corresponding music, and just
write it down.<p>The book review suggested that different
languages have different <i>patterns</i> in 
the speaking and, thus, for each such
language, music written in that language
will use similar <i>patterns</i>.  So from that
might argue that the Bach <i>Chaconne</i>
was not written by a native speaker of
French or Greek.  Or Massenet just does 
not sound like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,
Mendelssohn, Wagner, or R. Strauss!  Maybe
Massenet sounds more like Debussy or Ravel!",1413683920

I don&#x27;t think anyone wlll say that they prefer the new seasons over the older ones, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the new seasons are objectively bad. Whatever is said about the show, it still has the market cornered on Ivy League level humor. The best jokes are just <i>smart</i>, I would dare to say smarter and more insightful than any other television show. Fraiser at its best wasn&#x27;t nearly as intelligent as some of the Simpson&#x27;s throwaway jokes.<p>There used to be one truly inspired joke every few episodes. Now there might be only one or two per season, but they&#x27;re still there. The Simpsons remains on the air because there are some things that can only be done with the right combination of deep wit and animated insanity. It&#x27;s ok to make references to the classics or philosophy if you follow it with Homer getting hit in the groin. Plenty of shows are funny, animated or intelligent, but I can only think of one show that is the best of all three of those things.<p>Anyone who hasn&#x27;t watched The Simpsons in ten years should tune in to a few new episodes.

8476973,comment,8475720,8475720,0,0,A1kmm,,,"I think that the article trying to imply a stronger link between apologies and the law than really exists in practice.<p>Corporate apologies are not about trying to win a lawsuit or reduce damages, they are about trying to regain trust and prevent or stem the loss of market share.<p>The public are not so stupid as to be significantly swayed if the company apologises publicly for some problem and doesn&#x27;t say what they are doing to address the problem. For example, if a companies widgets were exploding, the company might apologise and explain that they have fixed the exploding component, and instituted review processes to stop it happening again. Sometimes the change will not be sufficient to fix the problem, and the public may not have the background to realise this.<p>The article claims safe apology &quot;laws provide another way to protect wrongdoers from liability&quot;. But that is not really true - without the laws, companies in the wrong would not apologise at all, so there would be no more evidence against them. The laws allow companies to apologise without legally self-incriminating; the article takes a very law centric view, but I would think most people would value an apology even if it didn&#x27;t incriminate the person making the apology - the apology (and particularly, the explanation of why it won&#x27;t happen again) has value to the public outside of the legal system. Of course, the company apologising should still be able to be held liable if their explanation is untrue or misleading (for example, if the company says that the new version of their widget no longer explodes, but they are lying to get more sales, and it in fact does still explode, they should face an additional charge with big penalties for misleading or deceptive conduct in the course of trade, with the apology admissible as evidence).",1413683131
8476972,comment,8475809,8476877,0,0,bastawhiz,,,"> why and what is this style of naming good for, and what one needs to do to master it?<p>It&#x27;s bullshit. The letters are not letters, they&#x27;re symbols. Replace them with JPGs of pokemon if you want. It&#x27;s just as well if they were ancient hieroglyphs. If you forgot what they all meant, you have to read the code and keep track of what variable name contains what. Or make a note on some paper.<p>This is why one-letter variable names are an antipattern: when there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason to what value is associated with what symbol (why is `c` the index of the newline and not `n`?), your brain isn&#x27;t going to remember it, and you&#x27;ve instantly forgotten what that code does. And everyone after you needs to do the same thing: you need to re-remember how each line of code works each time you work with it. And more importantly, looking at one dense line of code provides no context as to what the code around it does, compared to C or Python where one function can give you a decent idea of what its use is.<p>It&#x27;s even more of a nonsense issue because the actual name of the variable is just a number: every one-letter variable name maps to an integer. Why not support proper identifiers and replace them with unique integers at runtime? The same goes for whitespace: it doesn&#x27;t need to be kept in the program at runtime, but makes the application infinitely more readable because units of logic can be grouped on their own line.<p>So to answer your question: no, this is not good for anything and no, you shouldn&#x27;t try to master it because there are much more useful things that you could be doing with your life.",1413683081

Then you &quot;YHBT, HAND&quot; and scurry back to alt.religion.kibology where you post a recap for everyone&#x27;s amusement.<p>To my knowledge, that is the actual origin of the term as it pertains to the Internet (as opposed to the meaning in fishing, which is what it ultimately derived from).<p>Now it just means being an online griefer. I can accept that. There needs to be a name for it and that&#x27;s as good as any.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you think the original meaning of the term was, but most people who complain about mainstream culture getting Internet subcultures wrong think it dates back to the earlier days of web forums, which itself was a dilution of its meaning from Usenet.<p>The moral of the story is that it doesn&#x27;t matter. It may matter even less than getting riled up about hacker vs. cracker misuse, which itself is profoundly unworthy of getting worked up over. :)",1413682269

Long descriptive names have a concrete cost: they impair your ability to recognize visual patterns / turn common compositions into &quot;pictographs&quot; and they don&#x27;t refine well: instead of gaining an index and adding a bit to the definition the author has to come up with a bundle of new similar-but-slightly-and-meaningfully-different names from which someone else (including their future self) will be able to reverse-engineer the definition.<p>The shortcut of using descriptive names just doesn&#x27;t have the same ROI in all kinds of code. The first time I was forced to abandon my descriptive-naming ways was when I started writing finite element solvers. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a stretch to believe that (some areas of) finance have the same cost/benefit profile. Since this is a desktop programming example it&#x27;s relatively easy to come up with good descriptive names, so the short names are almost certainly a holdover.<p>Or it&#x27;s just a macho thing.

I&#x27;ve been back and forth to Korea about a half dozen times over last 13 years and have noticed the trend there as well (I&#x27;m not Korean, but my wife is).<p>My in-laws (Korean) are all talking about how hard it is to get kids to eat the kinds of foods they grew up with: salty, spicy, fermented (and generally pretty nutritious), and instead their kids are dead set on eating what they call &quot;American foods&quot; like hamburgers and pizza. Their parents complain about having to tone down certain strong flavors and ingredients in order to get their kids to eat the food at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as bad as they say, but I and my extended family in Korea have all noticed a rising wave of both obese kids in Korea, and much <i>taller</i> kids than any previous generation.<p>For people of my wife&#x27;s generation, I&#x27;m usually near the top of the height range for any random selection of people (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9&quot;).

A particle model of an aircraft based on Newtonian physics is even better and avoids those wacky approximations.

A mix of QM and General relativity is the best we have, but again it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Where was I going with that line of thinking?

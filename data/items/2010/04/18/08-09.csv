1274572,comment,1274440,1274460,0,0,cduan,,,"There are plenty of good reasons for selling tickets at lower-than-necessary prices on a first-come, first-served basis. If tickets were sold at market price (or auctioned off), they would tend to go to more affluent--and likely then older--customers. If they were sold by lottery, then they would be distributed to random customers.<p>However, ticket sellers want to sell to younger customers who are more likely to become loyal fans, buy merchandise, promote to friends, etc. The low prices help attract younger customers who likely are not as well off, and the first-come, first-serve policy tends to weed out customers who only have a marginal interest (and thus would not serve as loyal fans).<p>This isn't to say that this business model is the best; just to point out that there are more considerations than the volume of tickets sold or fairness in the sales.",1271580608

This isn't <i>just</i> compositing. Windows Vista and above and Linux with Compiz also do compositing in hardware -- that isn't nearly comparable to Direct2D, though, because all these solutions render on the CPU.<p>QuartzGL, which is somewhat nearer to D2D in intent, still isn't enabled by default, even on Snow Leopard. <a href=""http://www.tapper-ware.net/stable/web.dom.stresstest.transform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tapper-ware.net/stable/web.dom.stresstest.transfo...</a> is a good example of what's possible with true hardware acceleration and not just compositing: <a href=""http://www.tapper-ware.net/files/stresstest.comparison.ogg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tapper-ware.net/files/stresstest.comparison.ogg</a> shows how it performs on different browsers in Windows. Pretty stark difference, don't you think?<p>> Mozilla is very late to the party. It seems like they're following Microsoft's lead here after they released builds of IE9 that use Direct2D and started dropping talking points about 'accelerated graphics'.<p>It actually isn't. Mozilla started working on Direct2D support before Microsoft announced it, and the newest nightly is easily the fastest and most responsive browser currently available across any platform. It truly is a quantum leap, in that it is going to be impossible for a non-hardware accelerated browser to catch up.",1271578829

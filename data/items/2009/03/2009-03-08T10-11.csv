507150,comment,506229,506287,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Mice + Text Editors = Better editing.<p>You can move to a specific position easier & faster in a mouse.  When you're not in raw typing mode, you're mostly browsing and editing.  Mice are useful for that, and the time lost in hopping over to the mouse from the keyboard is well worth it.<p>I can move a mouse very quickly, and I can be very accurate about it. Text cursors are harder to predict, and they jump around (as the page scrolls), making them harder to track than the mouse.<p>What really sold me on the idea was a good amount of time using a macintosh.  A properly mouse-friendly environment makes you appreciate how useful the mouse can be.<p>Even back on a decent unix, I still love my select and middle-click to paste.  Scroll wheels are also pretty wonderful.",1236509591

507147,comment,506352,506352,0,0,SingAlong,,,"I was just checking the Sinatra docs and the Juno examples on the homepage.<p>Suppose I want to do mydomain.com/username,
Sinatra supports doing:<p>get '/:name' do
  #matches /username
end<p>but in Juno the route is set earlier itself, and hence seems like can't be done without a controller name (as it's called in cakephp)<p>@route('/hello/:name/')
    def hello(web, name):
        return 'Hello, %s' % name<p>Or if I'm wrong... can I do this?
@route('/:name/')
    def index(web, name):
        return 'Hello, %s' % name<p>Also, i've been used to PHP and would like to use Django or Juno or Sinatra or Rails or anyother language's framework. But the thing that puts me off is how do I start the webserver when using Sinatra or Django?<p>P.S: I love the routing system in Sinatra and Juno. Too friendly and no tinkering with regex directly",1236508035

Unless I'm mistaken (going on replicating this functionality in Vim), any beginner with a bit of determination and a browser can download and configure plugins to resemble this somewhat.<p>Now, it's highly possible that this guy is very proficient at using Emacs, but I'd have preferred a screen cast on the _editing_ features of Emacs over replicating TextMate.  For example, I would love to see someone re-do some of the bigger coding screen casts (such as the Ruby on Rails blog engine one) using Emacs.  It has the potential to not be useful--I know my Vim configuration is different from the standard and that there are a wide variety of ways to do things, but it might be enlightening to someone like me.<p>I have to say, aesthetics make a big difference to me.  I liked the icons in the project pane (though, with a mouse? Really?) and all, but that environment was far too spartan--uhh, ugly--for me.  I use MacVim, and with a bit of color scheme tweaking, a nice font etc. etc. I have a pleasing environment to work in.  Note I know you can do the same in Emacs, but the point was MacVim--it's the pretty scroll bars, the OS X anti-aliasing and all that makes it nice.  I can't use Vim in a terminal for long periods of time.  Obviously, this is definitely just me.",1236507375

You're overqualified for everything except laughably scarce tenure-track teaching positions.<p>You don't have to look at it that way, though.  A PhD in a quantitative social science, or maybe a media studies program would be in a good position to start founding startups...",1236507151

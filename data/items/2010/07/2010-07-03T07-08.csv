1483487,comment,1480897,1482180,0,0,varjag,,,"The connection is not as superficial as you like to present it. Lundström was a major backer of The Pirate Bay from the start, they would've had big troubles taking off without his help. Lundström went to court along with the four founders, and he was also charged and found guilty back then. Given his history of funding (then extremist) political parties, and his involvement in the PB, it is totally plausible he has a hand in piratpartiet as well.<p>There is quite a bit more between them than just an association. And if it was any other party backed by a Nazi am certain your threshold of tolerance would be quite lower than in this case.",1278143858

1483484,comment,1483405,1483405,0,0,inerte,,,"I've been called a perfectionist because of my coding maintenance. Dozens of my commits are ""Source code formatting"", where I try to make the code closer to PEP8 (Python).<p>But I don't go actively looking for things to ""fix"". While reading code, if only one line is separating functions, I add another. I add \ to line ends trying to limit width to 80 chars.<p>Lately my mantra has been ""Shipping is a feature"". Code working is my number one priority. But like most of the people, I like to think I'm above average, so I don't believe I write _bad_ code at the first time. I know it's not perfect. Just by saying this, I remember of things I know I should change to make the code better, but why bother?<p>What you must always pay attention is the balance between creating value for your customer, and for you as a professional. And even when you do things for yourself, always remember your main objective is to make things easier in the future to create value for your customers.<p>Caveats apply, of course. A refactoring to allow more modularity or whatever in the future might be good to do now, but honestly usually there are more pressing matters (unless the current pressure is to add some module functionality).<p>It's hard to give any straight answer. There are no hard rules, like ""you should only refactor during one hour per-day"". Maybe you're doing something where a big-design-upfront is not possible. Maybe not.<p>These things come with experience, tough. And where you want to keep your focus. If I was working on a 10 year code base where the original programmer has left the company, and didn't document anything, then I guess I would spend more time nurturing the code. But my job today is too fast paced, and ""when it will be ready"" is my customers/stakeholders number one priority. I negotiated and told them quality would suffer, and they are aware, but don't care much.",1278143684
1483483,comment,1482497,1483387,0,0,xenopia,,,"This kind of deceptive business is quite common, and they usually get away with it. It would be naive to think that the Feds have the resources to go after every company that engages in deceptive marketing. There is something more here. They have taken the trouble to get access to bank accounts, this is no minor step. I think they saw enough in those accounts to warrant going after this. While there may well have been a sweep account involved, the document seems to clearly imply that they looked at the pattern of individual deposits coming in from the ""customers."" To say that this is some overzealous prosecutor desperate for fame seems a bit hasty.<p>Consider that they pulled records of how many business reply cards came into the PO box and compared that to how many names were actually published in the book. They compared that to the bank accounts. While I have my doubts that the actual solicitation was illegal and that the total dollar amounts were so high, there seems to be more here than just an out of control prosecutor.<p>If United billed far more names than they actually published in the book, that would be fraud.",1278143634

1483467,comment,1478004,1478389,0,0,snom370,,,"I agree, the point I was trying to make was that deciding to _not_ buy a phone because it's fashionable is a fashion statement in itself. If the iPhone 4 is good, why not buy it regardless of how (over)hyped it is? Then again, I do see ideological/technical reasons not to buy the iPhone, for instance due to its closed nature.<p>I think Nokia could have challenged Apple if they had fully focused on Maemo when they first released the 770, and developed a culture of making better, more bug-free software. Now, I'm not so sure. Android has taken the place that Maemo could have had. Steve Jobs was actually right when he said that smartphones had ""baby software"" during the iPhone introduction - and the mobile industry didn't realize it at that point because _everyone_ were making baby software for their phones until Apple came along.<p>The people complaining that Apple didn't use the Newton OS for the iPhone doesn't realize that Apple would have been in the same position if they had (regardless of all the innovative features of the Newton).",1278142293

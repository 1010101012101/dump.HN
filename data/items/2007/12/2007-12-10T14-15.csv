Taxes give governments more money when they produce more carbon, which isn't a great thing. We don't have a good way to use that tax money to mitigate the effects of carbon - so it's not effectively internalizing that externality.",1197297686
87792,comment,87600,87600,0,0,koolmoe,,,"If nothing else, the author demonstrated the ability to work hard.  Demonstrating to yourself that you can work hard has a lot of value in and of itself, IMO.<p>Of course, there are other outlets for working hard, but for many Americans, high school and later college present the most obvious and most consistent opportunities to do so.  In fact, the author may have even <i>learned</i> how to work hard in college if he didn't already have that ethic.",1197297651

Blogs exist because it's possible to economically ""publish"" a paragraph. They abound, because thinking up one paragraph articles is easy. It's equally possible to publish a novel or a serial, or some new form. We really can't know yet what the long term literary impact of the internet will be.",1197297510

It usually won't be money that gets funneled into your private pocket, it will be added to a team war-chest for fun-days, extra training and offsite activities.<p>The reason that so many useless meetings exist is that no one has to float the bill. The second some suit in a different department needs to justify the expenses of calling too many people to too many non-productive meetings they diminish drastically.",1197295237

148388,comment,148244,148379,0,0,pg,,,"Batching ""admissions"" is net more efficient.  Plus the whole structure of YC requires it.<p>We do keep expanding.  Every batch has had more startups than the one before.  And we're always looking for ways to scale. Just this fall I wrote a bunch of software to keep track of and communicate with all the startups.  We'd be lost otherwise, now that the total is up to 80.",1206687325

148379,comment,148244,148361,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Most other Angel, VC, and incubator programs run a ""rolling admissions"" process. That would seem to take some of the time pressure out of the equation, but ""time"" as a limiting factor sounds more like the residue of inadequate productivity or know-how, or a function of the processes and structures the YC founders have put in place.<p>In other businesses, for example, if the number of startups that could take part in the program and offer a possibility of profit/upside or what have you for the investment of time and $ the business would find a way to address at least a majority of the demand (or unmet need). If YC had been funded by YC I would suspect they would be encouraging themselves to expand in a way that continued to create a compelling experience and a reasonable expectation of profit. Perhaps they are, since they talk about taking on more startups each time. I was struck by this article by George Gedron on the critical need for entrepreneurial education in the real world in Inc. <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071001/guest-speaker-the-real-world.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071001/guest-speaker-the-real-...</a><p>It seems that YC is one solution (and if they make a nickel   while doing so, more power to them). But Gedron isn't limited by time (any more than any of us are) because he is building a scalable repeatable model targeted at undergraduate education. I am not trying to play devil's advocate, I see a need for a factor of 100 to 1,000 scale up in what YC is doing (defined more broadly as entrepreneurial education, not just aimed at web applications).",1206686520
148378,comment,147984,147984,0,0,escopolis,,,"While I agree with your list, I would like to add that working side by side with professionals in the industry for which you are trying to get funding for could be the most valuable resource available. This allows you to gain an insight as to how a particular industry works as well as being able to network with the right people to help move you forward. Having the right team and the right people working along side you, can be a greater asset to any company wanting to achieve success. Without great people, there's no great success.",1206686305

This of course doesn't mean that the internet is the second coming of a virtual Jesus, but basing predictions on few archaic data in a dynamic environment doesn't make you a futurist, it makes you a bad historian.",1206684629

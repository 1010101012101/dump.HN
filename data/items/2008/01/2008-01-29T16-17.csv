You can get a couple press releases for under $1000, which will definitely jumpstart your SEO, traffic, and overall buzz.  But as tptacek noted, it is not magic.<p>$1000 is not a lot to work with in the pr world, and might be better spent with a PR consultant who can show/help you how to work the machine yourself.  I have a contact if you are interested.",1201624865

But those are not relevant to our debate. The issue is not whether people have silly or irrational personalities, but why. And in particular, whether it is best explained as due to ideas, or not.<p>Edit: To reasonably be so certain I haven't had a girlfriend, you must think I am quite young. What about my writing style makes you think I am young?",1201624414
106207,comment,106149,106149,0,0,Goladus,,,"eHarmony isn't successful because of the matching algorithm.  eHarmony is successful because of the steep barriers to entry, perception of safety and privacy, its ability to attract women to the site, the rate at which they regulate match delivery, and the guided communication process.<p>The result is that you don't waste much time browsing profiles.  You don't waste time trying to filter out spammers.  You don't waste time coming up with clever pick-up lines.  You don't get pestered by matches you close.<p>The matching algorithm definitely matters, but it's mostly a red herring.  If I were eHarmony, I'd be far more worried about my terrible user interface than the matching algorithm.",1201624360

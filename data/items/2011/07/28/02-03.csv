AirBnB should cover the cost of all damages as a gesture of goodwill.<p>It's really a shame that this kind of stuff can happen, but the reality (that I'd hope most people understand) is that not 100% of the population is good and decent (maybe it's 99%, maybe it's 98%, but it's certainly not 100%) Given that every mature adult is aware of this, the way the host acted was pretty irresponsible and was kind of inviting disaster.<p>She literally left a key for a total stranger to her home, without doing ANY due-diligence. Someone basically sent her an email, and she said ""okey-dokey, here's the keys, have fun."" What are the odds that if you do that 50 or 100 times that something like this <i>doesn't</i> happen? Also, how many people would be careless enough to do that?<p>Seriously, it's pretty tragic what happened and I really feel for the host, but it rubs me the wrong way that AirBnB is getting this massive amount of bad press when in fairness they just posted a listing and handled the transaction. Could they have more security measures in place? sure, but the way the host acted, I'm really not convinced anything would have made a difference here.<p>If you give keys to your place to a random stranger without so much as meeting them or getting basic information about them, then you're going to get burned.",1311821851

Imagine had they come out in June and fessed up and said this is how we are going to handle it. EJ we are taking care of everything, we are instituting new policies, looking into insurance and we will have a dedicated 24 hour hotline for customer support.

Being able to step back and be self-critical is extremely important to trading well.<p>Simple example : Suppose you bought Apple stock 2 years ago.  It has been a home-run.  Do you sell it now?  (record your answer).  Now look at the facts : You didn't actually buy the stock 2 years ago (most likely).  If you said 'sell now' would you short Apple stock now?  If you said hold, would aren't you really saying that you should buy it now?   It's a trivial example (wrong in many small ways, illustrative as far as the first-order argument goes, IHMO).<p>Of course, if the example is bad : tell me why.

Like most major crises, this one occurred as a result of not one ""bug,"" but two or more bugs occurring simultaneously.<p>The first ""bug"" arises from the fact that AirBnB is much like a pay-for-play dating service, with all of the flaws of that business model.  They <i>have</i> to control communication between the parties to keep from being cut out of the revenue loop... which means that they indisputably need to accept some responsibility for conducting the due diligence that they forbid their users to conduct.  That's expensive and risky at best, but if they don't step up to the responsibility -- which they don't -- then they don't deserve to succeed.  A stolen credit card should not be enough to gain access to someone's home for a week.  Cases like this provide the necessary publicity to call attention to the unfair bargain they offer hosts.<p>The second 'bug' was the almost unbelievable naivete on the part of the host.  She was, or should have been, aware of the terms of AirBnB's service and the limitations of their liability, because she would have had to agree to those terms and limitations when she signed up.  It shouldn't take a law degree to understand that AirBnB's terms are ridiculously inadequate when situations like this arise.  The idea of turning over the keys to your home to someone you've never met, based on the inadequate assurances and warranties offered by AirBnB, sinks to the level of incompetence IMHO.  Not everyone will agree, but come on... if what she did isn't ""asking for it,"" then there's no such thing as ""asking for it.""<p>To me, it seems clear that the responsibility for allowing this incident to happen falls on the host's shoulders... but at the same time, AirBnB should not be lauded for trying to play it both ways.  If they're going to do everything they can to prevent hosts and renters from doing ordinary due diligence on each other, then they also need to stand behind their decisionmaking process when they approve a renter.  I think a mandatory insurance policy has got to be part of the answer, just as common sense on the host's part is also a requirement.",1311818676

I tried for a few minutes to read your on-page copy and distill your products keywords but found it difficult.  It could be that I'm not familiar enough with the space/problem that your service addresses.  I'd be inclined to identify your competitors and the keywords for which they rank.  If a set of keywords can be identified I'd then use Google Keyword Tool to determine a set of keywords to target (i.e. those that you have a shot at ranking well for).",1311818665

They'd be as much paying to shutdown angles of bad press as anything else and this is so volatile because it's the first big story along these lines for them, it's beyond a basic theft and it's emotionally written. Future incidents probably won't contain those three elements.<p>Down the track, they can say ""Sorry, that other time was a once-off, we have many T&C/suggestions that cover what's happened"" and the victim is going to have to be unnaturally persistent with the press to create a story this damaging.",1311818656

I live a short walk from what I believe is the narrowest current spite house in the US, in Old Town Alexandria, Washington DC.  7 feet wide and still proudly lived in.  Nearby is +another+ spite house of the same period (post-federal).",1311818654

Did you hire an SEO firm or do it yourselves?<p>I've got a startup that's facing a fair amount of keyword competition. Ranking in search engines is going to take some time. Purchasing advertisements is possible, but our budget is limited. Any advice?",1199774963

If the average cost is $10k/month each that's another $10 million a month.<p>So even with some pretty naive assumptions, the storage cost is less than 5% overall.<p>GOOG's own 2007 statement ( <a href=""http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/revenues_q107.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/revenues_q107.h...</a> ) says their operating expenses were closer to $1B for the full year, which is about 4x this.   It also says they have closer to 12k full time employees.<p>Given that <a href=""http://glinden.blogspot.com/2008/01/mapreducing-20-petabytes-per-day.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glinden.blogspot.com/2008/01/mapreducing-20-petabytes...</a> claims to be doing 20PB MapReduce jobs, they obviously need a lot more than 5PB.<p>Still I bet their storage component is a lot closer to 1% of the total operating costs.",1199774151

You say the following:<p>>>> <i>Figure out what the important things are, and spend lots time on those and little on the rest. Lots of startups work very hard, but on the wrong things.</i><p>Product is number one, no question about it. What else do you consider important and what do you consider 'wrong things'?",1199773069

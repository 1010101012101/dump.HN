In particular that the random seed is set from the clock [not a bad practice in itself] and the clock is activated the first time the car is fired up [a somewhat problematic, since an attacker can be assumed to have the vehicle date via the VIN]. However, it&#x27;s not even that hard since the first time the vehicle is fired up, the clock is at it&#x27;s default time and date, and this narrows down the seeds to the range of potential latencies between the clock coming on line and the generation of the entropy pool.<p>In other words, the USB key can&#x27;t use stronger crypto than vehicle and that crypto is poorly implemented [again, based on my understanding of the original hack].",1441551504

I work in a smaller Engineering department and have to compete against huge internet companies for hires. I cannot compete on salary or technology, Google pays way more and plenty of others have more interesting technology stacks and development tasks. My approach to this has been to try to give my developers a path to the future. I do regular career development one-on-ones to identify what sort of things my developers are interested in doing, setting career development goals, and ending up with tasks for myself to steer their tasks more to the things they are interested in and providing training resources. I have also pushed, in what I thought was a judicious manner, for them to have greater ownership over areas of our systems. Finally, I do my utmost to publicly recognize their accomplishments.<p>Sadly, I continue to lose young devs. To a person, they say it isn&#x27;t anything personal, they were happy with my leadership, but they didn&#x27;t want to deal with the stress of my workplace or they had another opportunity they wished to pursue. I&#x27;m at my wits end, is this a fruitless desire on my part? Is there some secret sauce I am missing that would inspire my young devs to stay?",1441551194

I&#x27;d highly recommend starting locally with your own community before posting online for development. This will allow the online call for help to come from a community. Second, by starting locally, the author will gain experience working in a collaborative and consensus driven manner. Not an easy skill to gain but one which will be invaluable for such a project. Third, there are already groups working on this. Maybe join their project, branch off of it, or reference them and comment why the author believes a new project will better serve a community. And lastly, there is no single-stack that will provide the single solution. The nature of communities requires dynamic, evolving, flexible, multiple approach solution sets. Best of luck!",1441550725

Linear algebra is standard fare for an undergraduate curriculum - taught at thousands of universities - using innumerable textbooks. So it is not something highly specialised. It is conceivable that your book was largely inspired by other linear algebra books, if indirectly. For instance, you might have had strong opinions about why a particular approach does not work [1], and chose not to follow it. The search space has been reduced by authors who have come before. An academic writing a book in a more specialised area would probably not have the luxury of a writing precedent and would have to figure out a lot themselves.

10177700,comment,10176976,10177514,0,0,rambambam,,,"Just something to add to your comment, I don&#x27;t disagree with your suggestion: I frequently switched between a normal mouse, a Logitech Trackball (with the thumb on the ball, but I would definitely want to try one where I have to use the middle finger on the ball) and a Wacom pen-tablet.\nWhen I used one of the devices for a couple of days or weeks and when the pain (at least an annoying feeling, not necessarily pain) came back, I switched to another one.<p>This is not the only option to avoid or decrease pain. Like some other commenters said: your body position is important, frequent pauses away from keyboard (good for your eyes too), a smaller keyboard so your mouse is closer to the imaginary center of your body, regular walks or runs are very good (when you walk, don&#x27;t wear a heavy backpack or coat, so you can move your shoulders properly and relax your core, arms, shoulders and neck even more).<p>At the end, it&#x27;s about listening more to your body, I guess. I ignored the symptoms for too long, not knowing what was happening to me. And finally the RSI kicked in. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have CTS, but I had to recover for a couple of months and slowly had to build up the time I spent behind mouse and keyboard again.<p>The Body and Mind approach some other commenter talked about is also important and, I think, at the core of the problem. Relax, don&#x27;t stress behind your computer and mouse/keyboard. Peace of mind translates directly to a healthier body, in all sorts of ways.",1441549080

Writing books for them is a painstaking process during which they sacrifice and put their blood, sweat, and tears into those pages.<p>I think this article is saying, there is a disingenuous motive on the part of the publisher. The article does not seem to imply that the authors are complicit by playing along and pumping out the academic equivalent to pulp-fiction.\nWhen an academic puts their name on a published piece of work, it&#x27;s a serious thing. To accomplish something worth attaching one&#x27;s name to, it&#x27;s not economically feasible for the vast majority of academics to write pdf books pro-bono. Often their already barely making a livable salary and have their plates full. To expect them to write books for free is not at all reasonable.<p>I agree with the other commenter that this is indeed a good outcome. Paying academics to write these niche books is paying to build the modern Library of Alexandria. Walking through a top tier university&#x27;s library, one can&#x27;t help but be in awe of the wealth of knowledge being accumulated. And it has value. Some today. Some down the future. But it has value.<p>I myself have made use of several of these esoteric books, and could tell that they&#x27;d barely, if ever, been read. I couldn&#x27;t help but feel some gratitude toward the author for writing something so wonderful given it feeling like they&#x27;d written it for me and a few dozen other people.

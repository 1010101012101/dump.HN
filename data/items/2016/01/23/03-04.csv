The sports fans probably think they&#x27;re superior people because they spend all their time and energy following sports, instead of being like me and following sci-fi or programming or whatever.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t matter.  My whole point, which you seem to have missed, is that people have preferences.  I don&#x27;t give a shit about sports.  I don&#x27;t care about its hidden depths.  I have the right to my opinion, and to turn my nose up at sports, just like the sports fan has the right to turn his nose up at sci-fi.  Are you going to chastise him for not being open-minded and spending a bunch of time watching sci-fi movies he has no interest in and then being able to discuss them intelligently with coworkers?<p>The simple fact is that different people have different tastes and interests.  If someone wants to be curious and try learning about something different, then great.  If they&#x27;ve already given that thing a chance, or taken a quick look and decided it&#x27;s not for them, <i>there is nothing wrong with that</i>.  If that means that they feel &quot;left out&quot; when talking to coworkers, too bad.  That&#x27;s a natural byproduct of people having different interests.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be &quot;fixed&quot;.<p>Basically, what you&#x27;re doing is telling minorities that they need to take an active interest in things that the majority (meaning white people here) are interested in so that they can fit in better.  That sounds rather condescending to me honestly.  I used sports here as an analogy to point out that this isn&#x27;t a racial issue, we only see it here because different demographics tend to have different interests because of their different upbringings and environments.  No one makes an issue out of white northeasterners not being interested in gun shooting and muddin&#x27;.",1453520498

I went to university two states away from where I grew up, knowing a grand total of one person there. I had the academic end more or less handled, but my first semester at university was the loneliest I&#x27;ve ever been in my life. I made good grades, but otherwise I was miserable, depressed and lonely.<p>It&#x27;s easy to meet people in high school. Most high schools are small compared to major universities, and you have classes with those in your grade. Many of them you&#x27;ve been around for years. But now you&#x27;re thrown into a new setting, with thousands of people. It&#x27;s hard to make that transition from high school friendships to college friendships.<p>I spent my freshman fall pretty much just going to class and straight back to my dorm. On the weekends I would go to the football game, but that was it. The rest of the time I watched TV or played on the Internet. It was probably the loneliest I&#x27;ve ever been in my life and, as Christmas came that year I was seriously questioning whether or not I wanted to continue at my university. I had moved two states and five hours away, just to sit around and be lonely.<p>I told myself going back from Christmas if Spring semester wasn&#x27;t any better I was going to transfer back home. Well, spring rolls around and one of the guys I&#x27;d sat next to in the intro to engineering class invited me to rush his fraternity.<p><i>Whut?</i> I had been pretty vehemently anti-Greek; I was a nerdy computer science guy who liked roleplaying games and science fiction movies - not really what I assumed &quot;frat&quot; material was. So my first inclination was to say no thank you.<p>But I then I stopped myself. &quot;What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?&quot; I asked myself. &quot;The worst that happens is I don&#x27;t like it, and I&#x27;ve wasted a few hours. No matter what, it beats sitting in my dorm room, in the dark, mindlessly surfing the web.&quot;<p>So I did it. And it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made.<p>I met so many amazing, awesome people it blew my mind. The guy that ended up being my big brother (for non-fraternity folks, think of a big brother as a mentor) could have been my twin separated at birth - we shared so many arcane interests (<i>including</i> roleplaying games and science fiction movies - we had a chapter D&D campaign running by the end of the semester).<p>I was eventually initiated, and throughout the remainder of college, the fraternity was a big part of my social life. It was instrumental in breaking me out of my shell and grounded me in the university community. I ended up graduating, having never again considered transferring. And I learned so many valuable social and leadership skills thanks to being involved in the fraternity.<p>Fast forward 15 years, and the people I met in the fraternity are still some of my best and closest friends. I still do a couple of concerts a year with group of brothers, and have ever since we were in college together. My big brother was the best man in my wedding a few years back and I was the best man in his wedding last year. Several other brothers were groomsmen as well. Several brothers drove up for my daughter&#x27;s baptism a couple years, and we still go to gatherings once a year or so.<p>About eight years ago one of the brothers had his house burn down. We all pulled together and filled up a pickup truck worth of supplies to get them him and family through the tough time until insurance kicked in.<p>A group of four of us have a long running iMessage group that sees thousands of messages a year, especially involving our sports programs. When I&#x27;m watching football, I&#x27;m usually doing it with one window on the game and another on the chat window as we follow along. It&#x27;s like being with your friends at the pub.<p>And it goes without saying that brothers end up getting jobs from other brothers. I think I know people in every conceivable industry at this point thanks to having met them at university.<p>Pretty much every major event of my life since I pledged, fraternity brothers have been a part of. All because I took a risk on something I thought I might not like but decided to try anyway. I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.<p>So yes, those raucous parties and silly rituals do serve a purpose. We&#x27;re social creatures by nature and it&#x27;s a way of building up your social life, and blowing off the stress of school. Universities are institutions of learning, yes, but we&#x27;re not there <i>just</i> to learn 24/7, just like I&#x27;m not at my job now 24/7.

I find I constantly have a mindset of &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot; and it&#x27;s paralysing.<p>I went to Medical school and for a period of time was surrounded by people who, for the most part, came from affluent or otherwise successful families. My experience was the opposite of what you might have expected: I met many people who felt like they weren&#x27;t good enough, whose parents weren&#x27;t encouraging to them, and in several cases had no relationship with them whatsoever. Which I guess is only to say, if you want to be &quot;Good enough&quot; you just have to accept yourself for who you are and continuously try to be better. If you want to apply for the top tech jobs, you should. And if you fail, you should ask how you can improve, do so, and try again. Ultimately, you can only ever be good enough if you try. Failure isn&#x27;t a disastrous outcome; its absolutely a part of the process of getting better.",1453518455

And of course, before it became known that there was no life on Mars of Venus, most aliens claimed to be from Mars or Venus.<p>Strange how the technology and culture of aliens always seems to align with human cultural and technological norms, and how they always seem to be, biologically, human or humanoid. The aliens created by science fiction authors are often far more alien than the aliens people actually claim to encounter. The diversity of life <i>on Earth</i> is more alien. Never any Tines or Puppeteers or sentient blobs of dark matter or or twelve foot tall squamous hyperdimensional polyps. Just... strangely unusual space people in unusual space cars. But never too unusual.<p>I&#x27;m an extreme skeptic about UFOs as alien spacecraft and of alien visitation because, other reasons aside, the universe they seem to describe is depressingly mundane.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airship"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airship</a>",1453518307

These cubes have both.<p>What I call a voxel is much smaller (on the order of a screen pixel), and drawn as a point sprite or screen-facing quad with a single color. Texturing is achieved by having many voxels with different colors/materials.<p>Here are some videos of what we used to call voxels:<p>DOS game: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51E_G7NCXVM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51E_G7NCXVM</a><p>Gameboy game: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zVy-4CEFQU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zVy-4CEFQU</a><p>Medical imaging: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrLqFNhVL68"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrLqFNhVL68</a><p>Note that they were not using voxels because they had a certain artistic style to them.

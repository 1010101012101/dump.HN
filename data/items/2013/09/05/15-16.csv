6334936,comment,6332385,6334579,5,0,X-Istence,,,"The only time I have stalled out is when I am pulling away in first and let the clutch come up to fast. If you are stalling your engine going from 1st to 2nd you are doing something wrong, since the wheels are moving at that point. Even if you let the clutch come up too fast the engine won&#x27;t stall because the wheels will keep turning it. It might shudder and definitely not like the low RPM&#x27;s, but it shouldn&#x27;t stall.<p>With a manual all there is between the engine is the clutch and the transmission. When the clutch is engaged your engine to your wheels is a single straight line (with some gears in between, but lets ignore those for now). If your engine has a lot of power it will simply turn the wheels, however in most cases the engine is just simply not strong enough to break the friction of the tires agains the ground, especially in lower RPM&#x27;s.<p>When you slowly let the clutch up, what you are doing is having the engine turn faster than the pipe connected to the wheels, by using some friction material you transfer SOME of the power from the engine to the pipe connected to the wheels, as you continue rolling eventually the pipe connected to the wheels catches up and spins at the same speed as the engine (once again, ignore gearing), at that point you can let the clutch up entirely (thereby basically connecting it directly).<p>When you go from first to second, you use RPM matching to have the engine spin at the same speed as the pipe on the other end. When the RPM&#x27;s match, you let the clutch up and from there you can start providing more power by pushing the gas pedal.<p>See more about clutch construction here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch</a><p>---<p>In most automatics there is a device called a torque converter that takes care of the friction part of the clutch for you. Interestingly enough it does this using fluid rather than friction material. There are fins on both sides of the torque converter, the two sides can freely spin. One side is connected to the engine, the other side is connected to the gear box. As you press the gas pedal, one side forces fluid through a series of fins, this whips the fluid into motion, this fluid is then forced through another series of fins on the other half. Because of the pressure difference in the fluid it will eventually have enough power to start forcing the other side (attached to the gear box and the wheels) to start moving. At some point the engine side is spinning just as fast as the wheel side, at that point most torque converters will actually lock. Now the torque convertor is directly connecting the engine to the transmission to the wheels.<p>When it switches gears, it disengages the torque converter lock, lowers the engine RPM&#x27;s (even if you keep pressing the gas, it will use the computer to inject less gas temporarily), switch gears in the gear box, let the torque converter do it&#x27;s thing, and once RPM&#x27;s match closely re-engage the torque convertor lock.<p>See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter</a>",1378396753

With the success of social networks like Facebook and Twitter as proof, many people find a common expression of sentiment typed-out and displayed on a shared-view in a timely manner is sufficient to engender feelings of togetherness with other people.<p>What 2L brought to the table was the virtual environment. While many people find that online gaming brings a strong feeling of togetherness, I would argue that this feeling is driven largely by the common purpose present in most games. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the game is an MMORPG, or a shooter like Battlefield 3. The game provides the purpose, and the gaming network provides the social conduit. This doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have deep and meaningful relationships through these networks; just that the game provides the impetus.<p>With Facebook and Twitter, the common purpose exists in the real world, which makes the virtual reality of 2L redundant. Most people simply don&#x27;t need it to feel connected while watching a TV show, finishing their run, lounging around reading online, or attending a concert.",1378396698

What I do argue is that no one has much of an incentive to cheat you in this case.<p>>It is not a matter of whether they are doing it: it is a matter of whether they can do it. If there is no independent dealer, this is not for me.<p>Don&#x27;t change the subject. The discussion was around <i>if</i> they were doing it. We all know it could be done, that&#x27;s why we discussed this in the first place.<p>>And, by the way, as long as the machine can know what cards I am holding, I am not playing it either. Give me an independent dealer, and then we talk.<p>That&#x27;s fine. You require 100% certainty of not cheating and this machine doesn&#x27;t offer it.

Perfect is truly the enemy of the good.<p>Truth be told, it was a few diagrams similar to these (though non-moving) that I saw and studied when I was probably about ten years old that fired up my interest in the mechanics of automobiles specifically. That turned into a long-term pursuit and I even spent several years working professionally as a mechanic and delving into some custom and high-performance work. It was doing engine performance management and working with ECUs that I dove into electrical signalling and decided to shift gears a little and get into the high-tech world, so I put myself through college at night. I still think of those diagrams from time to time.<p>Someone&#x27;s creation of a few diagrams like this years ago opened up this kid&#x27;s mind in a lasting way.

6334880,comment,6333453,6334388,4,0,ianstallings,,,"I found this artile by Bryce Paradis that elaborates on using a Nash equilibrium for optimal play. He is known for bringing advanced mathematics to the game of limit poker and winning a small fortune because of it. Here is his take:<p>*\nQ: Whats a Nash Equilibrium or game theory optimal strategy?\n      Failed Math, Port Perry, Ontario\nA: An equilibrium strategy is one that wins the most money possible against a perfect opponent (this does not mean an opponent who can see your cards, but one who always knows your range whenever you take an action and makes the best choice against that range). In the game rock, paper, scissors, the equilibrium strategy is to randomly choose between the three options, choosing each one a third of the time in the long run. Finding equilibriums in poker is much more complicated, but the concept can be useful when youre playing lots of hands against tough opponents. For example, if your opponent bets half the pot on the river after a particular series of actions, the pot is offering him 2-1 on his bluff. If he were a perfect player, the right thing to do would be to call his bet a third of the time, since if you called more hed exploit you by never bluffing and if you called less hed exploit you by always bluffing. In reality, of course, our opponents are never perfect, and so the idea of playing an equilibrium strategy at the table is usually pretty academic.\n*<p><a href=""http://pokerpromagazine.com/proscorner/bryce-paradis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pokerpromagazine.com/proscorner/bryce-paradis/</a>",1378396200

As much as we often fear talking to customers, we&#x27;re human, and we&#x27;re built to need interaction with other humans. Trying to build software in a vacuum is really hard for technical and business reasons, but it&#x27;s also less rewarding psychologically. Most of the entrepreneurial types on Hacker News are not just trying to build a cool app or a great business, we are trying to add some small bit of meaning to the world. Talking to customers helps connect with that meaning (even beyond the satisfaction of customers using your product).",1378396050

The culture of &#x27;good enough&#x27; is far more damaging, in my experience.<p>FWIW: when I was fresh out of school my logic was sometimes pretty twisted, to put it kindly. Lots of deeply nested if statements, global variables used to maintain state (in the state machine sense) that sort of thing.

Are you the programmer with endless bugs, or the one that generates nearly bug free code. Are you a 10x programmer, or not? Are you the one that everyone asks questions of (to learn from you, or get your opinion on a design), or not? Do people seek you out for code reviews, or not? Do people need to come to you endlessly to try to figure out what your code is doing, or not? Does your code have a disproportionate number of bugs written against it? If there is a bug in your code, do the rest of your team members assign it to you because they can&#x27;t begin to understand your code? And so on. There&#x27;s no ego in any of that, but it is all reality(what I called the marketplace) telling you the quality of your code, in the measurable form of understand-ability, maintainability, bugginess, and so on.",1378396040

They need the same things most organizations need: dedicated, ongoing, boring IT support. Some problems can be solved in weekend hackathons, if you can get the right people together. But if you can&#x27;t contribute hacking time (some activist software is open-source), contribute your dollars.<p>* What almost all organizations want is your voice and your support. Know those online petitions that seem so stupid? They help. If you as an organizer can walk into a lawmaker&#x27;s office with a million signatures in your pocket, it amplifies your voice. And a talented campaigner can convert some of those signatures into more meaningful action elsewherein the form of donation dollars, real-life organizing, and local lobbying efforts.<p>* Learn about traditional political organizing, which has a long and proud history and has very little to do with software. Protests and movements don&#x27;t happen by accident; they&#x27;re built, sometimes in small pieces over many years, by fairly traditional organizing techniques. The Ladder of Engagement[0] is one metaphor that organizers use to talk about how to get people engaged.<p>* Learn about other organizations in the space. DemandProgress does a lot of work with legislators that goes largely unheralded (and they&#x27;ve just merged with Lessig&#x27;s Rootstrikers, which argues that getting money out of politics goes to the root of the problem); Fight for the Future is good at getting out the word on upcoming legislation. The EFF and the ACLU specialize in legal assistance and litigation, which is spectacularly successful when it works, but aren&#x27;t the only organizations working to support this space politically.<p>[0] <a href=""http://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/ladder-of-citizen-participation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/ladder-of-citizen-...</a>",1378395375

At a previous employer I built a system similar to this which produced nightly, weekly, monthly, and annual reports of weblog analysis for an app that had 6 million+ http requests per day. It was tough enough to consolidate those logs across the load-balanced servers in a single data-center. We never consolidated across data-centers (separate reports for each instead) and I doubt we could have shipped all of that data to a cloud service in a reasonable amount of time.<p>BTW, we made heavy use of setting and logging http headers too.

We then logged the response headers, which gave us the ability to report on the performance metrics.

If you broke the battery modules up into easily manageable pieces, it would take just as long to pull them all out and replace them with fresh ones as it would to just charge them up in place.<p>D) Consider that because an EV battery is so large, they tend to be located in fairly inaccessible places--under the passenger compartment, molded into the frame...

6334693,comment,6333424,6334154,3,0,RogerL,,,"That is not my experience. There is a ton of good to extremely good code out there. I&#x27;m rather dismayed by the amount of &quot;well, what can you do&quot; hands-thrown-up attitude here.<p>I&#x27;ve always found clean code to be <i>faster</i> to develop. I find that developers that produce lower quality code tend to spend their days debugging, fighting their code, reading and trying to figure out what they wrote 5 months ago, and so on. They are just not very productive. There are the outliers - people that have instant recall of all their code and elaborate mental models of really poorly structured code - but by and large I find that people that generate low quality code are quite slow performers.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in very good code bases, and very bad ones. In the good ones you can easily figure out what is going on, quickly make changes, confident that you aren&#x27;t breaking 5 things because things are decoupled. You can produce new code quickly because you aren&#x27;t fiddling with code nested 6 if statements deep, which is just about impossible to model correctly in your head. You aren&#x27;t in endless compile/run/debug (or REPL/run/debug) cycles because your first try is usually just about right, because you can understand the surrounding code. I recently requested a simple feature, and was told it would take a week. I was dubious. Then I looked at the code, and decided that they were being conservative, if anything... for something I thought would reasonably take a few hours.<p>This is just an impassioned plea, not to Jach, but to the profession, to cast a critical eye on code. You can produce high quality code quickly. Not &quot;nuclear reactor&quot; quality, but pretty close. Bad code always costs you. Always. Don&#x27;t write that way, don&#x27;t allow it in your code base, or in your teammates.",1378394314

It took a lot of mental effort to work out what the existing code was meant to be doing and what it was actually doing, both of which were wrong. At it&#x27;s core was a simple jQuery AJAX call with a success callback (no error callback, of course), but interleaved through it was a mess of global variables (&quot;finished_yet&quot;, &quot;time_last_checked&quot;, etc.), busy-loops, manual timeouts, state-rollback functions, etc. What I would call shit code.<p>Once I finally understood what it was doing enough to refactor it I managed to delete most of the file and replace it with a &quot;latest_id&quot; counter which incremented on each call, with the success handler skipping if its ID wasn&#x27;t the latest. Simple.<p>I approached the developer responsible for the original, to show him what I&#x27;d done and explain how Javascript&#x27;s scope let each call have its own ID. His response was that I&#x27;m using obscure language hacks which nobody is going to understand when they have to maintain it, that I should stop trying to force everything into a few lines and that he doesn&#x27;t need to learn about Javascript&#x27;s scope because he can already program so learning anything else is a waste of time that could be spent coding.<p>I got told a similar thing during a code review as well, since I&#x27;d used map on an array.

First of all, the IQ delta between Jews in the US and other white people has collapsed since 1960, and the overrepresentation of Jews in highschool and college level academic competitions has also collapsed.  This isn&#x27;t due to Jews becoming less intelligent on average but rather the average white child becoming more intelligent thanks to the Flynn effect[1].  And you&#x27;re grouping all white people together, but back in the day all the poor subsistence farmers immigrating from Ireland and Italy and Eastern Europe had IQs in the 80s too.  Of course, their children born and raised in US cities had roughly the same IQs as other white people.  And during the cold war the IQs of the people in West Germany pulled more than 10 points ahead of the people in East Germany, but with reunification IQs have converged again.<p>All of which is to say, we have strong evidence of differences in IQ between groups, but we have pretty much no evidence of <i>genetic</i> IQ differences between groups.

6334621,comment,6333203,6333778,5,0,vubuntu,,,"Excellent answer.<p>In the case of mass merchants where the risk profile of their business model is low (i.e they are not crowd funding or pre sales receivers of funds from end users), the paypal model works well for everyone. Risk is equally distributed between paypal and the merchant (since their risk of going bankrupt is less and not binary) and the end consumer continues to enjoy 0% risk.<p>But in a crowd funding (or any VC) model, the end consumer is &#x27;donating&#x27; / &#x27;contributing&#x27; to a project because they a) they love the product/concept b) they trust the project team  c) they are feeling generous  d) willing to take a gamble e) all of the above.  And inherently, the reason they are participating indicates that &#x27;they are willing to take some or all of the risk&#x27; . The problem here is that the current paypal model is unable to take advantage of their &#x27;willingness/promise of sharing the risk&#x27;, and hence not having/needing to be so draconian towards such crowd funding to cover their own behind. Probably there is no such model currently anywhere.<p>It is quite possible that these end customers who were willing to bet/gamble, in the end when a crowd funded project fails, having realized that they don&#x27;t have to take the risk after-all, are probably more than willing to take advantage of the system (bank chargebacks) to recover their contributions. But what if there were a model where we hold them to their willingness to &quot;bet/gamble/take the risk&quot; decision and only be a completely/mostly passive middlemen entity that only facilitates the transaction , like an eschrow account model (but where the funds go the intended beneficiary right away , if that is what the donaters want ).<p>Can paypal not build such a model where they can legally get confirmation/indemnification from end consumers/contributors to be willing to accept the risk completely/mostly upon themselves (or deal directly with merchant and indemnify paypal) if the project goes kaput? Or is the banking chargeback model so deeply ingrained, complex and inflexible that it cannot be molded in any way to achieve this purpose?<p>What if there were a banking/credit card concept of &quot;funds that are not eligible for chargeback per customer&#x27;s decision&quot;, and only such funds are used to pay to crowdfunding campaigns etc?",1378393660

Certainly if photography is insufficiently expressive to warrant first amendment protection, I wonder why it is covered under copyright law....  I usually suggest supposing that instead of outright refusing service, if the wedding photographer placed a slogan and logo on every wedding photo along with terms of service that forbid the customer from ever removing it, and which was unfriendly to same-sex couples, (for example &quot;One man.  One woman.  One holy marriage.&quot;  emphasizing a religious dimension regarding marriage, and the belief that it is between one man and one woman) if this would be protected.  It is <i>clearly</i> political speech in a commercial setting, and it is also <i>clearly</i> discriminatory (in the sense that it would effectively deny same-sex couples a right to enjoyment of their photographs).<p>If the ACLU is going to take a line that says that speech that is socially harmful is unprotected, maybe they should agree that restrictions on pornography should be up to the legislature if the legislature can show evidence of social harm, but of course they don&#x27;t.  They seem to hold that speech is good, especially political speech, unless it discriminates in ways they don&#x27;t like, but that is hardly a robust defence of free speech there.  The fundamental test of free speech is not whether the accepted viewpoints can be freely accepted, but quite frankly whether the Neonazis can march at Skokie or whether a cake decorator or photographer is going to be compelled to endorse a political message that he or she disagrees deeply with merely because it is a part of a commercial transaction.  It is the unpopular views which must be protected.<p>So I don&#x27;t think you can have perfect nondiscrimination in a commercial service without saying there is no free speech in the commercial sphere, which is where the case ends up on a collision course with Citizens United and why I wonder if the ACLU draws the line at speech by corporations that gets in the way of their other causes.....  (BTW I have a relative, now deceased, who was kicked out of the ACLU for defending first amendment rights more than the ACLU was comfortable with in the 1950&#x27;s-- he was defending the rights of Communists.  They did apologize much later. I would point out that the ACLU has not been exactly a shining beacon of support for the 1st Amendment consistently and this is nothing new.)<p>Getting back to the EFF, I think they have an easier time because their focus is narrower and so they don&#x27;t have the issues which get the ACLU (at least arguably correctly) labelled as inconsistent.  For this reason, I think that of the two organizations, the EFF is by far the more needed one right now.",1378393637

I refer to books like Code Complete, Debugging the Development Process, Clean Code, Refactoring, Programming Pearls, Beautiful Code, and so on. Then there are the language specific books. I don&#x27;t believe you can craft well written C++ without reading Scott Meyers&#x27; books (or having absorbed the same knowledge from others), for example. Even the much maligned Design Patterns, which has been turned into the truly dreadful design by pattern, helps us to think about how to structure code.<p>I can&#x27;t type it all in a post. But we are talking about modularity and extensibility. Decoupled code, so you can make changes here that don&#x27;t break something over there, and so you can easily move code from one project to another. Well commented code - where &#x27;well&#x27; means the author takes the use of the code into account - some deeply internal function named ComputeAverageSalary probably doesn&#x27;t need much in the way of extra comments, anda top level api call to a framework being used by thousands needs a lot of documentation. Well structured code. The if statements make sense. They are not deeply nested. logic is not duplicated, or contradicted when it is nested, because that always leaves you scratching your head as to the purpose of the author(s), and clueless as to how to add code.<p>So, back to the question, why would you bet that? I&#x27;ve opened plenty of 15 year old code that is good to beautiful.  This is not an arbitrary judgement of &quot;oh, OO good/bad&quot;, nor an reactionary &quot;it wasn&#x27;t written by me, so it must be bad&quot;.<p>I do consider myself a pretty clean programmer, but I learned it by observing the code of others, reading a lot of books, and relentlessly applying a critical eye on everything I write and others write. All borne not on some arbitrary judgement, but from recognition of how quickly/slowly I can grok a piece of code, how easy it is to find and fix bugs, how easy to add features, and so on. In some code bases that is all fairly straightforward, and in others it is impossible - any fix or change has so many side effects that you need to add 50 if statements strewn about 50 files, in code already filled with if statements, and your if statement break about 15 undocumented assumptions about the behavior of the tightly coupled code.... that, my friends, is shit.",1378393479

Every trip is a perilous journey with tales of imminent death.<p>I honestly feel the same about people who walk around declaring all code shit. People who aren&#x27;t competent with their development tools, can&#x27;t naturally trace code and truly understand functionality, and can&#x27;t adapt to different styles and era of code tend to be the ones, in my experience, that declare all code shit.",1378393376

So when we spot a billboard in the distance advertising some awesome spectacle and the kids say, &quot;Can we go there, Dad?&quot; I have to determine whether it&#x27;s more than 15 miles off course.  &#x27;Cause if it is, then no, we can&#x27;t go there.  Unless someone wants to push the car.<p>To be fair, it probably took a while before gas stations sprouted up like mushrooms all over the vast, heaving bosom of America too, and I do wish nothing but success for Musk and Tesla.

Once the accounts are associated <i>to you</i>, those associations last <i>forever</i> and follow you immediately and irrevocably anywhere else an account becomes associated <i>to you</i>.<p>[1] sure, sure -- using your real name as a username is Bad For Privacy, but the author wasn&#x27;t talking about janeannsmith vs sparklepony2031.  They were talking about janeannsmith vs jane-ann-smith  and janeannsmith vs janineannsmith -- should jane ann smith have turned out to be the name of a porn star or third world dictator or some such.<p>Frankly, as far as privacy goes via name conflicts, you&#x27;re better off being named Mike Johnson and having lots of collisions, even if some are negative, than having some unique name that doesn&#x27;t have an online association yet.  Some plausible deniability is better than none.<p>However, for branding, the opposite is true.

So it proves (while justifying) the rule that you have to prefix all of your symbols unless you&#x27;re Thompson or Ritchie in the 70s. Even now, in newer C features, extra acrobatics are done to avoid name collisions (_Bool in C99 for example).<p>But this is really a side issue to my original point: C++ and PHP are categorically different since there aren&#x27;t strong alternatives to C++ for many types of problems.

8235584,comment,8235120,8235120,3,0,jhallenworld,,,"The one argument I can make is that MIPS is too simple.  But I would only make this claim on the simplest of in-order single or dual issue implementations.  Think of a memcpy loop: 32-bit ARM and PowerPC can update the pointers as a side effect of the load and store instructions, but MIPS can not.  You could make similar arguments in favour of ARM&#x27;s thumb instruction set (more work done per 32-bits of instruction loaded with low decoding overhead vs. x86).<p>For implementations more advanced than this... I don&#x27;t think you can make any such claim based on ISA.  x86 may be at a slight disadvantage due to decoding, but that&#x27;s about it.",1409190996

This means that you might have &quot;,&quot; in the middle of a string. Anything (like cut or awk) that depends on comma as a delimiter will not handle this situation well.<p>2) &quot;cut&quot; has shorter, easier to remember syntax than awk for selecting fields from a delimited file.<p>3) Did you know that you can do a database-style join directly in UNIX with common command line tools? See &quot;join&quot; - assumes your input files are sorted by join key.<p>4) As others have said - you almost invevitably want to run sort before you run uniq, since uniq only works on adjacent records.<p>5) sed doesn&#x27;t get enough love: sed &#x27;1d&#x27; to delete the first line of a file. Useful for removing those pesky headers that interfere with later steps.

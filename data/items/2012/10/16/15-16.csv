The H-1B statutes are designed to allow employers to legally pay H-1B workers less than Americans and IBM (and a lot of others) is taking full advantage.<p>This is interesting, because the H-1B process costs about 5k in processing and lawyer fees, plus an additional 2kish fee for larger companies.<p>In addition to this, companies are required to pay the prevailing wage for that profession and location to foreign workers, so that they can not undercut Americans (or at least that was what was intended).<p>Prevailing wages are determined by the Dept of Labor, the same guys who set minimum wages. Unless this data is way off-base, H-1B workers are <i>by definition</i> not cheaper than the average worker.<p>What I see as being likelier is that H-1B workers are an easy-to-hire pool of workers (the average H-1B worker is super happy to get a job / visa), who are willing to work hard for just above prevailing wage.<p>Not to mention that if there is a lack of supply of american workers who are working for around prevailing wage (because they already have jobs and can't be hired), it's easier to hire people from abroad than to wait until those workers are available or more workers come in.<p>P.S. The CIS is known for its slightly odd conservative stance on immigration, which is something like ""we don't want foreigners to come in if they can compete with Americans (who were also immigrants), but otherwise we're pro-immigration (under these very stringent requirements)""<p>---------------------<p>edit: Now that I think about it, it's likelier that a ton of these workers come in L-1 visas. These are for intra-company transfers for multinationals. These have no prevailing wage requirements. So IBM india can hire a worker and move them over here for the same wage. And it still allows dual-intent, so you can eventually get a green card via L-1.",1350403110

And, further, the way it's implemented is an insanely stupid horrible pain in the ass.

So the logical thing would be to use IE in Metro, and Chrome on the desktop.<p>But you know what?  You can't sanely do that.  Only the default browser gets to live in Metro.  And when I say default, I really mean default.  If you set Chrome as your default browser, then <i>you cannot launch Metro IE</i>--the ONLY Metro browser you can launch is Chrome.<p>It's the little things like this that are making it REALLY hard for me to stay a Windows 8 supporter.

4660348,comment,4660048,4660048,3,0,Animus7,,,"Since you asked, here are the problems I see. Most of these I've learned the hard way working on a similar problem for over 2 years, so hopefully that counts for something.<p>1- The main cost of third-party software is <i>never</i> the cost of the code; it's the cost of using, integrating, customizing, and gettng support for it. The utility of the raw code itself is often zero. This is why binpress - selling code - never (really) took off, but github - a code <i>community</i> - did.<p>2- Given no restrictions, the prices people slap onto source code get very ridiculous, very fast. Non-technical people expect well-polished software for $1.99 (see: App Store). Hobbyists and developers often have a case of NIH, and a lot of them think that code should be communal and free (as in beer). The reasons are varied but the end result is that source code (by itself) is not considered a valuable commodity by the market anymore, which means nobody cares about selling theirs - or they try and quickly learn it's not worth it.<p>3- Licensing. You have a minefield of legal issues of ownership resolve. If you haven't looked into it, you probably don't even realize the extent of the BS that will be thrown at you.<p>4- I won't sugar coat this. You'll never make any money on a 3% comission of a commodity that's already priced dangerously close to zero by the market (see #2). The costs of dealing with people whining when things go wrong - alone - will exceed your comission.<p>5- I'm a developer, and I just don't see the value-add here. I have to do my own marketing, I have to do my own sales, I have to write the software, and I have to support it. If I'm going to go through that trouble, why don't I just blast up my own template Stripe page w/download link and cut out the middleman?<p>I guess what I'm saying is: please don't make my mistakes. Do something different and make different mistakes.<p>Also, I'm from Waterloo so I understand what it's like to be a tech entrepreneur in Canada.

I wouldn't have a problem with a points system for general, skilled immigration though.<p>However, that appears to be unlikely at this moment.  If I had to tinker with the system, I'd say that the two biggest problems are 1) the visa gives the employer too much control over the employee's right to reside in the US, and 2) the ""prevailing wage"" requirement isn't effective.<p>The ""indentured"" problem is easily solved, just award the visa directly to the employee with full rights to reside in the US for the duration of the visa.<p>The ""prevailing wage"" problem is a little more complicated.  The first big problem is that this requirements is easily circumvented.  At my organization, there are different salary tiers for programmers.  It would be trivial to hire an expert at a lower level and claim you are paying the prevailing wage.<p>A more fundamental problem is that even an honest attempt to pay the ""prevailing wage"" can still lead to wage stagnation across the field.  Generally, when a ""shortage"" occurs, wages rise and new people are attracted to the field.  One reason for the ""shortage"" of software developers is that US citizens with the talent do this can find equal or greater wages with better career stability in other fields.<p>Wages need to rise to draw them back into software, but if employers are able to use visas to pay ""market rate"", this increase may not happen - or if it does, the rate of increase may be diminished.<p>To solve this, I'd instead use a pay index that includes fields outside of programming, and set a high floor for visas.  For instance, you might decide that 120K+ a year is the minimum salary allowable for an H1B (necessary, not sufficient).  I know many employers will object vehemently to this, but keep in mind, they are arguing for a specialized visa that bypasses the normal immigration system, justified by the claim that these are highly educated, critical workers that employers can't find at any price.  Hard to believe that these highly educated workers are really so hard to find if you object to paying 2/3 of what a 24 year old out of a top law school would earn (yes, I know, that's only the top law grads, but nobody is claiming that there's a shortage of middle tier law grads, we're talking about a shortage of critical, highly educated workers.",1350402731

That would be a good thing. If Microsoft really tries to control Windows-Apps that much that they ban popular games, they probably will kill Windows and games will adapt to Linux. Fine with me.<p>But it doesn't have to come that way. The comparison to DOS is probably flawed. The new UI is, as far as i understood without being a windows developer, just an UI (with maybe a new API). The classical desktop is not like DOS an operating system Windows has to evolve from.

Division is the inverse of both, so z/c is z rotated by -arg(c) and dilated by 1/|c|.<p>What you're looking at, then, is taking the operation defined by c (rotate by -arg(c) and dilate by 1/|c|) and asking, if you take the Gaussian integers as the vertexes of a directed graph, what fraction of the vertexes are the source of an edge.<p>Consider the 1 dimensional analogy using real numbers. Given some real number c, take all the integers as the vertexes of a graph, and if z/c (for some integer z) is also an integer, I put a directed edge from z to z/c. When are these connected? Well, if c is irrational, never. If c is rational, then there will be an infinite number of connections, but how infinite? When c is 2, there will be twice as many edges on average in any subset of the source vertexes as when c is 4. If we can write c as p/q, then the smaller p is, the more edges we'll get, and the brighter the pixel in your image.<p>The 1 dimensional analogy will have a spike at 1/2, smaller spikes at 1/3 and 2/3, yet smaller spikes at 1/4 and 3/4, smaller ones yet at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5, etc. The spikes will all be distinct (because between any two rationals there is an irrational), but will be infinitely close (because the rationals are dense in the reals). As you keep zooming in, you will get more and more edges like this.<p>What you're seeing is a variation on the classical structure of the rationals dense within the reals.<p>Now, a fractal is a set with a fractional Hausdorff dimension. We have to extract a set from your function of c in order to talk about fractal dimension. We could take the support of the function (everywhere it's not zero). In the one dimensional case, that's the rationals. We could take level sets farther up (the set of c such that f(c) = k, for a constant k). Those are subsets of the rationals. However, the rationals, while dense in the reals, are of measure zero in the reals, and have Hausdorff dimension zero, and so do all the level sets. So it's not a fractal.<p>Doesn't make it any less pretty though.",1350402480

I recognize that many people buy an extra keyboard for their iPad, and prefer that for significant typing.<p>The point I'm making is what is the differentiating feature here?   The UI is different, true, but then its the keyboard.<p>There are two keyboard covers- one is flat, with no keys which I suspect would be much like typing on the iPAd screen (though of course, not actually on the screen... so a little different) and the other has keys, so similar to buying an external keyboard for the iPAd, only it is slightly more integrated.<p>Is that really compelling?  Compared to buying a wireless keyboard for the iPad, the price is about the same (or cheaper for the iPad).... and the advantage of the Surface is that the keyboard connects to the tablet with magnets?<p>I just don't see that as being significant enough to really take significant share away from Apple.

But many developers come from a computer science background, and I've never seen a computer science curriculum teach students about logging, testing, runtime instrumentation, monitoring theory, security, or deployment.<p>In university, you write code in a very unrealistic fashion. Lots of individual coding, some teamwork, but your assignments nominally have well-defined inputs and outputs, and students effectively never have to carry projects across classes and semesters, the way that you would with a production application.<p>Sysadmins, having been exposed to this, assume that developers are out to kill everything with a BIOS, and as a result tend to lock systems down, or implement weird hacks to get around the lack of logging or instrumentation.<p>In companies I've consulted with, a bit of education goes a long way towards fixing this. I usually rotate a dev at a time through the sysadmin team, where they can both help in debugging problems, as well as tackling all the interrupts that would otherwise be divided evenly among all the engineers.<p>The developers learn about why logging is important, gain a better understanding of the deployment process and environment, and the sysadmins gain a greater understanding of what the devs are trying to accomplish.<p>It's amazingly effective in fixing the false dev/ops split, and in getting the two teams working together effectively.",1350401829

Chemical process patents are identical to computer algorithm patents in this respect, just replace bits with molecules, and are among the oldest patentable subject matters. Long, complex sequential algorithms are a feature of many engineering disciplines.<p>Chemical engineering, to use that example, designs elaborate and complex dynamic systems by chaining together abstract chemical algorithms. Each one of those little algorithms is subject to both patent and copyright. Like with software most of the commonly used algorithms and clever hacks were either never patented or the patents have long expired. It is only on the bleeding edge that some chemical algorithms are under patent; as with computer algorithms there are an unbounded number of potential algorithms but some are more efficient than others. Specific implementations are still covered by copyright and are widely licensed (as libraries).<p>Most of the nominal specialness attributed to software as a domain for intellectual property does not really exist. Yet the rarely questioned assertion that computer software is special in some way has created a dearth of comparative studies that would likely be valuable from both a theoretical standpoint as well as a practical policy standpoint. Either these other areas, like chemical processes, are equally broken at a fundamental level and the scope should be extended beyond software, or there are differences in implementation across otherwise equivalent domains and we should borrowing from the better implementation.

As the iron levels go back to baseline and the opportunistic plankton gets absorbed into the food chain, now the existing food base is gone, just as a huge population spike of higher-on-the-food-chain species is ready to chow down.<p>You see this sort of effect in gulf ""dead zones"" where fertilizer (iron sulfate is definitely fertilizer in this case) has killed the existing balance and will take many years to reverse.<p>That said, perhaps some good could come of this type of practice.  It's too bad this sort of vigilante experimentation is the only kind that can go on- if scientific bodies would endorse more research on limited scales, we'd have a lot more data for the potential damage.",1350400298

4660116,comment,4659341,4659341,4,0,jhull,,,"I can speak a bit from personal experience. I just spent close to 3 months in Rwanda and one of the coolest things I found there was an incubator called kLab in Kigali (www.klab.rw) that was modeled after incubators they have in Kenya. I heard from some ex-pats who lived there that one of the main problems affecting the ICT industry in Africa in general is that you can go through the CS programs at their university and never touch a computer. Many teachers don't have the programming chops and their students can't do anything about that, so anyone who does know how to code either learned on their own, or learned outside of country. At kLab they love Udacity and run study groups where students and former students meet up and learn Python and work on project/homeworks together (they have a demo night tonight in fact.) They also have all sorts of regular meetups for web apps, entrepreneurship etc.<p>Another thing about Rwanda that is surely affecting their growth and blows many African countries out of the water is they have wired most of the country with Fiber where most have dial up speeds. It is not yet common residentially, but for global businesses to establish a base in East Africa, this is huge. I lived two hours outside the capital in a mud house with out running water inside, but I did have 1-Mbps download (was near a rural, well-financed hospital, but still, it was faster internet than I had in Boston.) This is largely all due to the government there which is a pretty well-oiled machine with a bit of a benevolent dictator, but one who gets things done for the benefit of the country IMHO. Contrast with where I am currently living in West Africa in Sierra Leone where the infrastructure is dismal and there is no kLab type place anywhere. There is a lot less action in the startup/entrepreneurship scene. Bad infrastructure, a long civil war and countless other things feed into this.<p>In terms of startups...so much of Africa runs on mobile phones (the majority of small amounts of money is transferred via SMS) and most of what I saw in terms of startups was based around Mobile-Social-Local. Not unlike what you see in the US and elsewhere.",1350399998

This was written well before Swade was on the Babbage case and was based on reading of the primary documents.  A couple of quotes from it:<p>""In the summer of 1843, Menabrea's paper was translated by Ada Augusta, Countess of Lovelace, and only legitimate daughter of Lord Bryon; she composed, in extensive consultation with Babbage, a series of long notes to the paper, which together comprised about three times the length of Menabrea's original version. The whole was published in Richard Taylor's Scientific Memoirs for 1843, 92 under the title ""Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, Esq;"" this was the only extensive paper on the Analytical Engine published in English during Babbage's life, or, indeed, up to the present. Although it is clear that Lady Lovelace was a woman of considerable interest and talent, and it is clear that she understood to a very considerable degree Babbage's ideas about the general character and significance of the Analytical Engine, and expressed them well in her notes to Menabrea's paper, it is equally clear that the ideas were indeed Babbage's and not hers; indeed, she never made any claim to the contrary. She made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in anyway. And she did not even express an interest in learning about the machine until January 5, 1841, 93 even as late as June 30, 1843, she apparently knew quite little about the mechanical details of the Engine""<p>""All of this is said not to belittle Lady Lovelace, but because a very exaggerated view has been formed by some recent writers of the significance of her contribution to the Engine or of her role in Babbage's life.""<p>The citations for those parts are Babbage's personal correspondence with Lovelace that are held by the British Museum.",1350399719

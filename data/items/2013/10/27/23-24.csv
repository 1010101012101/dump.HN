6624261,comment,6622394,6623420,4,0,adventured,,,"That&#x27;s not true at all.<p>The Fed&#x27;s policies encourage money to chase risk. When money is &#x27;free&#x27; it becomes wildly risk seeking. People that acquire free money do not do the responsible thing and seek safe investments (ask most lottery winners). That&#x27;s why you see massive asset bubbles develop with low interest rates. The Fed has in fact said it wants to create an artificial wealth effect by leveraging asset bubbles, they wanted to re-inflate the housing bubble for example with toxic mortgage purchases and low mortgage rates.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it. The US Treasury has stepped forward to admit as much.<p><a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-13/us-treasury-finally-admits-truth-its-all-pomo-and-no-one-dares-fight-fed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-08-13/us-treasury-finally...</a><p>Or take a look at the S&P without the Fed:<p><a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/chart-year-fed-has-doubled-sp-admits-fed?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/chart-year-fed-has-doubled-sp-...</a><p>Or overlay the S&P with the Fed securities:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QFHnbBv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QFHnbBv.jpg</a><p>There is now an endless parade of evidence available as to exactly how the Fed creates asset bubbles (we&#x27;re on our third bubble period right now in just 15 years), and how their programs directly inflate the value of the stock market. The Fed has even taken direct credit for being responsible for as much as 40% of the stock market&#x27;s value.",1382918328

I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re trying to say with the Rick Rubin comment either. Do you have a high opinion of Rick Rubin? I&#x27;m pretty sure Rick Rubin has a high opinion of Kanye.<p>I make music as a hobby, am fairly decent at it (IMHO, anyway) and listen to a lot of music. Kanye puts together songs, particularly on Yeezus, that are different than what else is out there and I have little doubt that Yeezus will influence a lot of rap over the next few years.<p>I never tried to equate Kanye West to Lou Reed.",1382918256

6624241,comment,6623830,6623830,69,0,FD3SA,,,"<i>&quot;The demand for sexy results, combined with indifferent follow-up, means that billions of dollars in worldwide resources devoted to finding and developing remedies for the diseases that afflict us all is being thrown down a rathole. NIH and the rest of the scientific community are just now waking up to the realization that science has lost its way, and it may take years to get back on the right path.</i>&quot;<p>The institution of science is undergoing a catastrophic decline. The reason behind this is simple: it is no longer a growing economy. Public funding for science is frozen or being cut, private R&D labs are shuttering their doors, and companies are increasingly concerned with quarterly results at the expense of long term research.<p>And why should it be otherwise? Science has never payed off as a logical financial investment. It is the riskiest of gambles by definition, requiring inordinate expenditures of time and resources in the present for a chance at some distant breakthrough decades or even centuries in the future. Institutional science is not an economically sound choice in the best of times, let alone during the current span of never-ending recessions.<p>The truth is, science is a creative pursuit much like the arts. Like the creation of literary masterpieces or profound paintings, it has never made economic sense in the present. Only afterwards, once the impact can be seen, do we understand its significance. And that is why it will always be worth pursuing.<p>The reality is that, increasingly, we live in a society that does not understand this philosophy of life. People only care about how they will survive tomorrow, and who can blame them, as the world economy gets ever more competitive and cut-throat.<p>Increasingly, it has become clear that our society does not reflect one designed with its own best interests at heart. Why this is, how it happened, and how we can change it, will be the greatest challenge of our lifetimes.",1382917849

I&#x27;m thinking of something while traveling on the bus and suddenly I catch myself reading some silly slogan on a board. Now it&#x27;s stored somewhere and I might think about it later again. I never wanted to read that thing and feel like it has been forced upon me. How many hours of collective thinking power have been lost to ads processing ?<p>Ads publishers treat us like a free resources that they can tap into. They hire psychologist and sociologists to know the best way to trigger emotional responses into us. They track our every move on the Internet. TV shows are especially created to dumb us down and make us more receptive to the ad-break. And ads are so omnipresent that they are virtually unavoidable. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I got convinced to buy by an ad but it must work since they keep doing it.<p>So yes, I don&#x27;t feel bad and ad-block the hell of everything and wish I could do it in the real life too.<p>EDIT: Actually my biggest grief is that the price of ads is not clearly exposed.

6624236,comment,6622394,6623803,3,0,ketralnis,,,"> But if the online prices are no better, then Amazon provides no benefit<p>Speaking only for myself, the vast selection and stock is a huge factor for why I often prefer to buy things from Amazon.<p>For instance, there&#x27;s a particular mustard that I like that is hard to find in stores nearby. I don&#x27;t like it enough to justify going from store to store to find it, but I do like it enough to buy it from Amazon for the same price that I would pay by doing that, and just wait a day or two. Often stores are out of stock of the things that I want. Amazon tells me that without leaving the house. I live in a city where a trip to a store that isn&#x27;t in walking distance can be a couple of hours or more to haul myself around on transit, but Amazon delivers to my office. I imagine that there are people in more rural areas that if the local store just doesn&#x27;t have what you&#x27;re after, you&#x27;re out of luck. And so on.<p>My point is, there are plenty of reasons besides price to give up immediacy",1382917712

If it says you&#x27;re vulnerable you&#x27;re probably hosed already and the only sensible option is to take the service offline until you&#x27;ve generated a new key-pair.<p>Actually, I guess the proper advice is probably to shut down any 1024 bit key protected services right now, and generate 2048 or more bit keys for them. If you&#x27;ve been running any services with 1024 bit keys where sniffing the cleartext of a session would reveal login credentials to anything important, and that key is a known &quot;weak&quot; key, it&#x27;s probably time to assume the global passive adversary already has root on that box.<p>Try running:<p>> wc .ssh/*.pub<p>if that&#x27;s returning key files with character counts below 7 or 8 hundred, run:<p>> ssh-keygen -l -f .ssh/id_rsa.pub<p>(where id_rsa.pub is the filename of the &quot;short&quot; public key) to determine the actual key length. (there&#x27;s probably a better heuristic than my &quot;about 7 or 8 hundred characters&quot;, I&#x27;m seeing 1024 bit rsa keys in the 200-300 char range and 1024 bit dsa keys in the 500-600char range.

Well, people in the financial industry who could move to Singapore or Zurich or whatever might well do that, and so stop wanting to rent houses. But there are vanishingly few such people - you&#x27;re talking about the elite. Their loss (if we call it a loss) wouldn&#x27;t have much impact on demand. The kinds of stupendous penthouses and townhouses they rent mean they&#x27;re not even competing in the same market as the normal middle-class mugs. The majority of people in the financial industry - from bank apparatchiks down to post-room clerks - aren&#x27;t about to up sticks and migrate to a tax haven. If their jobs go away, they will be looking for other jobs in London.<p>Even if they decide to give up and go and become shepherds in the Dales or something, how many of them are there? Finance is big in London, but it&#x27;s far from being a dominant employer. There are huge numbers of people working in all the other sectors of a post-industrial economy too - law, media, IT, corporate head offices of all sorts, academia, healthcare, culture, not to mention all those civil service jobs. If we accept the (forecast) 2013 numbers in <a href=""http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/wp51.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/wp51.pdf</a> then finance employs 357 000 people, out of a total of 4 859 000 - 7.3%.

It&#x27;s utterly ridiculous!  It&#x27;s as if thousands of guitarists were auditioning at the same time and, in an effort to be heard, each has cranked their amp to 11.

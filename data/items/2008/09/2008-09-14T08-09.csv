(though nobody ever does it that way, instead doing it with 2 passes).<p>Do you know of a proof that grouping and alternation cannot be implemented in this way? (formal or informal).",1221382069

I love it!<p>.<p>* Great stuff on the homepage....ALWAYS something I'm interested in!<p>* The comment system isn't full of witty comments just said to get karma....Reddit is big for this, and even Digg, even though it doesn't have an overall user karma system!<p>* Overall, HN makes NEW knowledge, it doesn't just pass on current knowledge - people asking questions, and getting answers, both in submissions and comments, is a massive sign of the quality of the users.<p>.<p>Long live the current state of HN!",1221381336

Suicide were a notable punk band who used them, while Magazine and Joy Division were big synth users and barely post punk. The reason they weren&#x27;t emblematic with the first wave of punk was entirely down to cost - they were seen as a millionaire&#x27;s instrument and therefore tasteless and decadent. Once Roland started mass producing, synths became far more popular with post punk bands and spawned an entire movement, from Cabaret Voltaire to Depeche Mode.",1443920240

For example:<p>- Do we want to move into new line of business X? Would purchasing Company Y help us do this?<p>- What qualities are we looking for in the person we&#x27;ll hire to replace our CTO, who just turned in her resignation?<p>- Should we be trying to negotiate a better deal with our health insurance provider when the contract renews?<p>- Should we change the way we recruit developers? Should we open a new office in Shanghai to get access to the pool of developers there?<p>- Is government regulation in our industry likely to hurt our business over the next few years?<p>The company still needs people to deal with questions like these, and real-time operational data doesn&#x27;t really help with these kinds of problems.",1443920178

Virtual Machine, for example, has two meanings:<p>1) A <i>system virtual machine</i> provides a complete system platform which supports the execution of a complete operating system (OS).[1] These usually emulate an existing architecture, and are built with the purpose of either providing a platform to run programs where the real hardware is not available for use (for example, executing on otherwise obsolete platforms), or of having multiple instances of virtual machines leading to more efficient use of computing resources, both in terms of energy consumption and cost effectiveness (known as hardware virtualization, the key to a cloud computing environment), or both.<p>2) A <i>process virtual machine</i> (also, language virtual machine) is designed to run a single program, which means that it supports a single process. Such virtual machines are usually closely suited to one or more programming languages and built with the purpose of providing program portability and flexibility (amongst other things). An essential characteristic of a virtual machine is that the software running inside is limited to the resources and abstractions provided by the virtual machine—it cannot break out of its virtual environment.<p>The CLI is the second type of virtual machine and something like VirtualBox, VMware, and IBM mainframe VM&#x27;s are the first kind.<p>> Why byte code? Or, in what sense can each code be only one byte long?<p>Again, it&#x27;s not &quot;byte code&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;bytecode&quot; which is defined here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode</a><p>&quot;Bytecode, also known as p-code (portable code), is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter&quot;",1443918171

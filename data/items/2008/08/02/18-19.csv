I think that quite a few hackers could use a non-technical cofounder (provided the person is very good at their job), especially in markets like enterprise software or financial services. I'm not necessarily sure this is the best way to pair up technical and non-technical founders, but I'll be curious to see whether the program is successful.",1217700544

If the US govt. wants to crack down on ISPs this way, I would prefer that they at least do it through congress. Giving government more power is in general a bad idea. When this power is given to unelected bodies like the FCC (in a system based on ""rule by the people"") its a recipe for disaster. We already know that government bureaucrats are not the smartest of the bunch when it comes to IT. Do you really want to give them even more power to regulate it in the hopes that they don't do something stupid? I would rather leave it to corporations which have at least some incentive to act rationally.",1217700272

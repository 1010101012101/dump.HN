48993,comment,48799,48799,0,0,vlad,,,"(The following is an exercise in critical thinking, only shows one side of the issue, and does not reflect my opinion either way.)<p>Tall people don't earn ""high"" wages, they earn ""higher"" wages (only about $500 a year more according to recent studies.)  And if the person is tall, and their kids are tall, $500 a year is likely not enough to cover the extra costs of food.  If there should be a change, it should be that the government should pass a law that tall people should be paid at least $5,000 a year more, to cover bigger, non-entry level, non-Toyota or Honda sedans and SUV's, worse gas mileage, greater car expenses, and the price of size XL-Tall and 2XL-Tall clothing from specialty stores since regular stores don't carry tall sizes.<p>Why don't articles write about that?  Everybody wants to point out that tall people earn $500 a year more, on average, but not the fact that shorter people come out on top.  That extra $1 a day does not cover the extra food for one person, let alone a family, nor does it cover the greater car, specialty clothing, gas, car repair, car insurance, and other expenses whatsoever for even one tall person, nor their family.<p>A tall person may also use shampoo and soap much faster, and need to use more water in the shower.<p>If anything, the status quo encourages more short people to reproduce.<p>And, if taller people actually are ""smarter"" or more productive (for whatever reason, be it confidence or something else) then they're _really_ getting the short end of the stick by having to survive with $4,500 less yearly taxable income.<p>(I like to think from both sides of the issue, and I haven't seen that side addressed any time the issue has been brought up.)",1188597057

Most likely they'll enjoy them and feel privileged they are getting to use them before they are really ready. They'll see the potential. They'll start imagining what it'll be like once it's finished.\nIf it's a cool, innovative feature they haven't seen before, they'll see it as proof you're a cool place to be. Even if half of it doesn't work.<p>Get features out often. Of course make sure they don't break anything else, or reduce the users experience, but users love to see a site evolving and changing with them on board.",1188596787

I would rather have too much than too little.<p>Static typing is a big win, particularly if you don't have to declare everything (Scala has local type inference).<p>Sure, there are lots of bright people using Python.

48985,comment,48916,48916,0,0,wwhchung,,,"The article's statements on the problems with SOA don't accurately reflect reality.  For example, ""SOA requires you to do a whole load of up-front design and specification that's very difficult to change after.""  This is not a problem with SOA, rather than a symptom of poor change management, which can occur in any code base whether you are using SOA or not.  Similarly, his ""strange loops"" issue is really an issue of poor dependency management/mapping.  You can easily write a program that exhibits the same problems.<p>One valid issue with SOA is data consistency.  Dealing with data consistency across services is a real problem, and this may contribute to extra development time.  But by no means does this indicate that SOA is the opposite of agile.  There are agile development benefits in SOA, and I don't feel that the drawbacks outweigh these benefits.",1188596063

Commands like ""ls"" and ""h os"".<p>""ls"" is a simple command -- invokes the Unix command ""ls -l"".  A more complicated one: ""h os"" -- run help on the os module (just like ""help(os)""). This is kinda tricky because ""h os"" is actually a syntax error in Python. When interactive, I catch syntax errors and see if they are user defined commands, in which case I execute the desired command. This works for Python 2.5, but shouldn't be too hard to port to Python 3.0. <p>I briefly looked at IPython, but that seemed to complicated for my needs.<p>\n(Also, <a href=""http://defcraft.org/hacks/pycmds/strftime_helper.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://defcraft.org/hacks/pycmds/strftime_helper.py</a> uses the above file to help the user with strftime spec usage.

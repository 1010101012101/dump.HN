In general, Constitutional rights apply to non-citizens within the US, and this has been held since at least 1886, see e.g. <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2010/02/01/collins_5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2010/02/01/collins_5/</a>.  There have been various Supreme Court cases over the last decade about whether they apply to people under the jurisdiction of but not inside the US, namely Guantanamo detainees.  Outside of US jurisdiction, there are circumstances in which residents of foreign countries can violate US law (criminal or civil matters), which involve interacting with the US, such as (for better or worse) &quot;cybercrime&quot;, in which case the US can attempt to extradite them or take other measures.  These are separate issues, but only the one about Guantanamo detainees is at all controversial.",1383379059

Since the mirror is in fact a gyroscope it will keep pointing at the same direction if no external force or moment is applied, regardless of the movements of the missile. The voltage applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation.&quot;<p>Essentially saying that it tracks what is within it&#x27;s line of sight.

First of all, are you earning any money on those first time referral users? If not, that gives you total freedom to experiment. But regardless, subject the first time referred users to an absolute battery of segmented tests (A/B or multivariate or whatever scheme you&#x27;re comfortable you can analyze results from) with pretty much the sole purpose of figuring out how to get more of those users to visit more sticky pages. Especially if people are coming in from long tail searches, I think you&#x27;d be better focusing on turning them into users than &quot;drive by&quot; assaulting them with ads like it feels like the site currently is doing.<p>E.g. consider imgur. Consider users coming to imgur pages from Reddit (consider your specific traffic sources, and whether or not you can do anything &quot;special&quot; for them)- not only do they get an interface to navigate that in many cases are more convenient than continuing to browse the equivalent image reddits, but you can even go to imgur.com/r/someimagereddit (e.g. <a href=""http://imgur.com/r/pics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/r/pics</a>) and get all the pictures from that subreddit in one place. It&#x27;s seductive. Then there&#x27;s ability to comment. The image pages themselves are extremely clean. It&#x27;s seductive.<p>While if I get to your site from Google search results (say by entering &quot;twitter babes&quot; and going to the image results - I tested, it gives a Twicsy result high up, in between the porn), I need to go below the fold to even realize that there are related pictures, and there are no &quot;niceties&quot; like being able to use cursor left/right to move through a &quot;gallery&quot;, or space to enlarge the image, as on imgur.com (if there are on Twicsy, I didn&#x27;t notice them). What is there is massively distracting ads.<p>Imgur is teasing people in when they hit it for the first time, making it very tempting to click one more image, while your site is pretty much bunching people in the face with ads, which makes it hard to even discover the potential.",1383376981
6658456,comment,6657982,6658162,2,0,Natsu,,,"Never seen one imagine a cardboard box as a rocket ship, or such?  That&#x27;s simply abstract thought of another kind.  To be honest, I feel more like rote schoolwork beats it out of them than the opposite, given how many children I&#x27;ve seen that are more capable than the adults, but that&#x27;s a bit of a tangent.<p>For the record, it&#x27;s not actually that hard to teach younger kids advanced mathematics.  Just turn it into a game.  I managed to teach a ~10 year old about mutually tangent circles, after all.  And I was certainly never bound by the imaginary limits of what kids were &quot;supposed&quot; to learn at a certain age.  Roughly the first half of the &quot;advanced&quot; branches of math is giving funny names to things and learning a few tricks.  Basic set theory, for example, would not be all that hard to teach to a young child, but most don&#x27;t see any value in it.<p>Anyhow, yes, that test is fairly confusingly worded (partly just from stupid and partly because we lack the context of the lessons).  In particular, I agree that coins & coffee cups are a bridge too far, so they could certainly do better.  But I guess people would rather WTF over the strange wording and downvote and such rather than consider whether little kids should be taught that there&#x27;s more to addition than rote memorization of the addition tables?  (For the record, yes, they should memorize the tables, too.)<p>I found it quite simple to discern that they were taught to split the problems into the part they know and the whole thing, then look for the missing piece and turn the problems into &quot;stories&quot; connecting the numbers to real objects.<p>Would everyone rather that kids learn that math is a bunch of boring number facts to memorize that have no (apparent) application to real life?  Or is it the feeling that the way you were taught is plenty good and nobody should ever try to improve it, especially in a way that you don&#x27;t understand?  Or does this whole line of thinking simply make people uncomfortable and cause them to reject the thought entirely?",1383376730

That was added by some dumb schmucks in the lull between the dot-com boom and this one, when nobody was paying attention or doing new startups. No startup in their right mind would choose a city that taxes stock options.<p>The reporting on this is rather poor. It characterizes this as an additional &quot;cost&quot; or &quot;loss&quot; to the city, e.g. &quot;Twitter tax break to cost far more than estimates&quot;.[1]<p>But what&#x27;s missing from the reports is that this component, the stock option tax, is relatively new (2004) and has never been enforced. It&#x27;s not that the city is losing something they had. They never had it. It was a bad idea that was slipped in during a down cycle when nobody understood or cared about the implications.<p>I think Zynga calculated that they would end up paying more in local taxes than they pay for their building itself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/technology/dotcommentary/article/Twitter-tax-break-to-cost-far-more-than-estimates-4929370.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/technology/dotcommentary/article/Twitt...</a>",1383376465

6658439,comment,6657301,6657301,17,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Interestingly, terminal guidance has been the simple part for decades. Back when people thought &quot;hitting a bullet with a bullet&quot; type of kinetic intercept was hard, what they did not realize is that the software is relatively straightforward and even primitive computers are fast enough to do hypersonic intercept. Newtonian physics is slow compared to a computer.<p>The hard part, outside of having an adequate sensor to begin with (a problem of many early designs), is designing a high-performance steerable rocket motor that can consistently deliver the precision that the software is capable of demanding under the performance envelopes required. This turns out to be an exotic materials science and precision fabrication problem so comfortably in the domain of conventional hardware engineering. As cool as it is to design a terminal guidance system, that is the easy part of building a practical anti-aircraft system.<p>Also, most vaguely modern systems do not track objects per se, they extract the features of the designated target with broad spectrum imaging and only chase that. In other words, the missile does not chase <i>a</i> plane, it chases <i>the</i> plane. This means that the Hollywood trope of being hit by your own missile generally won&#x27;t work in reality.",1383376042

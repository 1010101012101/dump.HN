I am not much well read on biology, but I think there were recent advancements where some organisms also showed quantum effects playing a biological role. Even with disregarding our current lack of knowledge we can still argue if brain is a discrete set or not, proving either would be a major contributing factor in our understanding of it I think.",1282064352

In my industry, if I sold out tomorrow, I'd get the value of my servers, plus about a years revenue.  Now, there's no way I'd sell at that price, but that's market for a ISP or hosting company.

Having said that there are many, many small grammatical errors.  Even so, the writing is pretty clear, and most of the errors do not obscure the meaning.  That's impressive.<p>You say:<p><pre><code>    A similar approach, learning only when required, is\n    good for hackers.  According to me, learning what's\n    necessary when a situation calls for it triumphs over\n    that of learning just because something exists or is\n    available. ... I advocate learning as a process that\n    is supposed to run in parallel with implementation.\n    You learn by doing it and you learn only because you\n    require it.\n</code></pre>\nI think this is thoroughly, fundamentally wrong.  Dangerously wrong.  I think you should have a voracious appetite for knowledge and information that currently lies just out of reach, even if it serves no useful purpose.  Time and time again I've found that things I learned simply because they were interesting have turned out to be crucial in understanding something critical later on.<p>You can never know in advance what you will need, and chance favors the prepared mind.  The legendary golfer Gary Player said ""The more I practise the luckier I get.""<p>Learn stuff beyond what you think you need.<p>Several times you say ""Most engineers ..."" and then say something that is, in my mind, completely at odds with the majority of engineers I know.  It started to annoy me, and made me start to doubt other things you were saying.  Specifically, for example, I don't know any good engineers who think ""writing good code means saving every possible byte of memory and computational power.""  You seem simply to be setting up straw men to be knocked down, and that's not a convincing style.  Your points should stand on their own.<p>There are several other points with which I disagree, but they're your opinions, and I won't argue them here.<p>There are grammatical errors such as this:<p><pre><code>    ""They might be simple like a software that solves ...""\n</code></pre>\nThe ""a"" is unnecessary (and incorrect).<p>There are many other places where you have unnecessary words and the writing could be tightened significantly.<p>And it feels like it rambles.  It's not really clear what your main point is, or how you're getting there.  You have a lot of opinions that you state, and clearly feel are self-evident, but there's not much of a logical progression.<p>But finally, and this is my main point, I read it to the end and was interested.

The rough physical properties, like temperature, and the general chemicals around are stable, but beyond that things are constantly moving and sloshing around in a very unpredictable way.<p>The idea with the three-body problem is that after some time has passed, we have utterly no idea where the bodies have ended up. Ova don't grow into random jumbles of cells, most of the time they grow into babies.<p>It takes a lot of very specific information to grow into a baby instead of some entirely different arrangement of proteins. So either the environment needs to be feeding some rather specific controlling information that makes most ova grow into normal babies, or the cellular machinery itself has a system which compensates for external disturbances and constrains the design to mostly what the DNA directs it to be.

It could therefore be said that the simple equation of the Mandelbrot set represents infinite complexity.<p>However, if you take a particular iteration of the formula, then you can get a finite concept of its complexity, i.e. how many bits it takes to represent the image you're seeing.<p>So, to say that the ""the brain cannot be more complex than the data that specifies it"" is true in one sense, but completely useless in another.<p>To put this into terms of the Mandelbrot, you can gather up all the bits that represents some particular iteration of the Mandelbrot, but that doesn't tell you anything about how it works, or even how to generate the next frame. You need the equation for that.<p>That's just one place where Ray fails. The second is the lingering question of whether computers in their current state are even capable of ""simulating"" a brain. It's still not an answered question of what the role of the non-determinism found in Quantum Mechanics plays in the brain and the interactions of various chemicals. It was recently shown that DNA relies on QM entanglement to ""hold it together"".

Analogies between biological systems and computers, software, machines, etc. are <i>very loose</i> analogies meant to illustrate a point. Never take these analogies too seriously.<p>DNA is not a program-- it is a molecule, and one that may very well do things at the quantum level that are biologically important.<p>The brain is not a neural network. It is an interconnected colony of living cells of a variety of types, and it has been shown that all types of cells in the brain are involved in cognition.<p>We are nowhere near anything with the parallelism or information density of the brain. Getting close would take an advancement in computer technology of the magnitude of the transition from vacuum tubes in individual boxes to a 32nm Core i7. Nature has had billions of years, and it is way ahead of us. There's a nascent field called quantum biology that suggests that the brain may very well be a quantum computer, so maybe quantum computers are the vacuum tubes->ICs scale transition I am speaking of.<p>I think it's now possible with a big rack of multi-core machines in an MPI cluster to approach the capabilities of a fruit fly's brain.<p>Cells are not machines. I don't think we have the language to really describe what they are perfectly, but the closest I can come is ""stochastic quantum probability field device.""    A bacterial flagellum is not a ""motor,"" it is a quantum-scale chemo-electro-motive... well... our language breaks down. Like Feynman said, don't tell stories. Just speak literally and then use math.<p>Actually, come to think of it, there's one engineering analogy that might work for biology. Biology is quantum-scale nanotechnology. Yeah, that's pretty close.<p>(On a related tangent, I've found that many engineers are sympathetic to intelligent design type arguments against evolution. This is because they try to think about biology like engineers and take these machine analogies literally. It just doesn't work like that.)",1282061005

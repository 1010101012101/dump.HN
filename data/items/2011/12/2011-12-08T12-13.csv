For example - in my country for more important contracts (like selling house, etc) there is a requirement, that  apart from both sides signs, that ""notariusz"" (dictionary says it's notary public) will sign this contract.<p>""Notariusz"" is regulated job, there is constant amount of them (you have to pass very hard exam to become one, and mostly being a notariusz goes from father to son ,because others won't pass exams somehow). People are required to hire a notariusz to check important contracts, and notariusz gets percentage of contract worth for a work, that any intelligent people will do anyway (like checking ground register before buying a house, etc).<p>I do think they are sometimes usefull, but why regulate them? Why are they mandatory? People that want to risk should be able to risk, people that want to be safe can pay more to be safe. In IT various schools and certificates exists, so people can prove, that they are good enough to do some job. There are bad schools and better schools and certificates, why do you think state will be better at assesing people qualifications than private company (which sole buisness model will depend on being good at that). Why is state always trying to do others work?<p>I'd much prefer free market in such matters. The same goes for engineers, architects, etc. Just make sure people are responsible for their errors, and there would be cheap but risky architects, and expansive but safe ones. And insurance companies would require you to hire these with respectable certificates.<p>No need for state to mess with this.",1323348519

Writing GL/SL shaders is very tough compared to Obj-C which has better support as it is C.<p>You have excellent debugging tools at your disposal on iOS and then look at Android Debugger :( You never know, You can never optimize your games on android the way you can on iOS, Just because it generates a native executable. Sure some day even android would support native apps, But that day the app delivery promise would be broken. You would have to make games for at-least the major mobile manufacturers and test them on major variants. And You would still end up not reaching potentially every android device. Because of Hardware profile inconsistency. So the whole reachablity is a myth.<p>Add to that the day someone starts developing an App on android in C++ whats the advantage ? There were many Open platforms before android whats new ? Look at Openmoko.org<p>Sure android is great for freeloaders but the consumer just ends up paying the same amount in-spite of the OS being free.

What you say makes no sense. Ok it makes sense, but does not make sense in context of jQuery. jQuery was never intended to be a framework or tool to organize your code. It is just a DOM/events/Ajax library, that's it. Its purpose is completely orthogonal to what Backbone does and even more so to what Coffeescript does.

 possibly poor UI (de-coupling of controls, insufficient communication that aircraft had lapsed to alternate law)
 small-scale systems failure (pitots)<p>vs 
 incorrect response and continued failure to understand aircraft attitude (in turbulence, with no visual cues, in a situation which 'fooled' three pilots)<p>...which makes it an interesting one for manufacturer and airline to definitively defend, but I would guess that they can and will absolve themselves from liability.",1323345960

I don't know what's happened with this framework in the last couple of years, but when I was first learning Rails and enjoying it, I used cakePHP for a big project because I knew PHP well, and didn't yet feel comfortable with committing to using Rails for it.<p>That was a decision I regretted many times.  The hoops I had to jump through to deal with complex database queries were ridiculous.  The difference in quality and robustness between ActiveRecord and cakePHP's ORM (at that time, anyway) were pronounced, with AR coming out way, way ahead.<p>There's no doubt, in my mind, that if you are going to take on a large, ambitious web application project, you'll be better served by Rails.",1323345637

571717,comment,571618,571618,0,0,jerf,,,"I see two basic possibilities: One, it ran out of money before it could launch, or two, it <i>doesn't actually work</i>.<p>I would put relative probabilities of those two as somewhere around 1:9.<p>I look at this thing as an engineer and I see a signal processing problem that means it's probably pretty easy to build something that's right about 70% of the time, and with great effort you could get to 85%... but that's terrible for an input device. Maybe I'm wrong. But I also know for a fact I've encountered tons of people who have faced other problems like this, and in their boundless optimism are <i>sure</i> that the last few percent are just a matter of trying harder, and some of them go on to blow millions on ""trying harder"" on what is fundamentally impossible. The truth is, electronics really don't care how optimistic you are.<p>Most of the 'first class' ideas you think are being overlooked are actually the second case. 3D interfaces, a whole whackload of input devices (including the fun case of exotic video game console interfaces), energy sources, new circuit types that are going to blow silicon out of the water, and the list just goes on and on. Most of them just plain <i>don't work</i> like the advocates said they would.<p>Some of the advocates are honestly wrong. Some... are not.<p>Just about the only thing that factors in this thing's favor is that exotic input interfaces have historically faced a very steep uphill battle. Dvorak and other alternate keyboard layouts have gotten very little traction, and that involves no extra hardware at all. I've used a couple of exotic input devices or methods that work perfectly fine but stand no chance of general acceptance because people have no interest in learning how to use them.<p>(I would point out that I've left open the possibility that it does work. But I'd want to see a lot of evidence not coming directly from the company. Everybody <i>always</i> claims awesomeness.)",1240275439

This is how technology matures. The market explores the new space with tons of releases with tons of features. Eventually, the best features are evolved and incorporated into all models via consumer selection. Sometimes this takes ""ten models for every human"" before we come up with the <i>one</i> model for every human.<p>The thing I've found about most of these sound-bite vaporware products that are going to ""change the world when its released"", is that most suffer from the 95% problem. The idea 95% works. But the 5% that doesn't makes it unusable.<p>In this example, perhaps it works <i>just</i> like a keyboard! The only thing we haven't been able to solve yet is that it confuses j and n 25% of the time. So its useless.<p>Many products get into the 95% phase, generate all of their buzz, tout their impending, world changing release, and then flame out struggling for that last 5%. To make matters worse, their investors then sell the leftover company for pennies to patent trolls who ensure that its not worth it for anyone else to solve that last 5% either.",1240274711
571696,comment,571447,571447,0,0,rue,,,"I would provide a personal anecdote:<p>The shoes I use (I did not like Vibrams) are <a href=""http://feelmax.com/panka_leather.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feelmax.com/panka_leather.html</a>. They have a very thin (3mm?) kevlar compound outsole to protect the foot from glass, sharp rocks etc. It is thin enough to fully feel the ground texture underfoot. I am a bicyclist, so aside from a few trials, my experience is limited to ""barefoot"" walking.<p>According to the fairly reasonable theory that the human foot and leg is best suited for toe-stepping (like most animals), not the heel, I also modified my gait to stepping on the ball of the foot. After an adjustment period (and finding some pretty much unused leg muscles), it provides for a far more fluid movement, with the leg muscles and ligaments acting as shock absorbers. Trying heel-stepping thereafter brings to focus the fairly harsh impact each step actually causes in that mode of transportation. Plus toe-stepping helps keeping balance on slippery surfaces.",1240274538

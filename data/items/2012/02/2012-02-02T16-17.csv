3543482,comment,3542931,3543285,7,0,mjb,,,"Why is this being downvoted? The processor used (i-7 2600) does not support ECC RAM, and this platform does not include it. A server platform without ECC RAM is a pretty big disadvantage for several reasons, to most compelling being the high real-world rate of memory errors in real systems. Memory errors in non-ECC systems can be extremely difficult and expensive to track down, and can cause data corruption or loss if the machine is used in the data pipeline.<p>In one study (<a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ebianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ebianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf</a>), strong correlations were found between age, usage and error rate. Before using a server without ECC RAM, it's worth doing a quick estimate of the amount of data you intend to move around, and whether it's worth it to you (and, more importantly, your customers) to save a little money going with a non-ECC platform.",1328201980

3543476,comment,3542415,3542415,2,0,eldude,,,"The people this is going to hurt the most are the citizens and businesses in France. No company or entrepreneur is going to want to setup shop in a country where success is punished. No creator, achiever or pursuer of excellence will desire to go to France if they risk being sued the moment they become successful enough to be worth it. Argue all you want that this is about ""monopolies"" and ""anti-competitive"" behavior, but what this is really about is greed. The greed of Bottin Cartographes, jealous of Google's success, using a government that doesn't respect private property rights to steal from another. This is reprehensible behavior on behalf of the government, its people, and anyone here who defends it.<p>If the only differentiating factor between the ""monopoly"" and a local business is price, the ""monopoly"" is going to win every time, and this is in fact a _good_ thing and best for everyone as it rewards successful business models. The ""monopoly"" didn't become successful because it was handed to them, it had to compete and earn it, and now it's enjoying the fruits of its labor. If on the other hand it did not earn its position, but instead lobbied or procured favors from government officials, then it deserves to be shut down, broken up, etc... as this is what's known in a free market as corruption.<p>Competition does not die in the face of a stronger competitor. Competition dies when rewards are removed and you take away the purpose for competing. Reward inferior products and call it justice, and you'll get more of the same.<p>Ask yourself this; If this were to happen in Silicon Valley, would Silicon Valley as we know it continue to exist?

3543440,comment,3543143,3543143,15,0,cscotta,,,"It is unfortunate that many young tech companies, in an effort to differentiate themselves, work to invent a new term and cloak it with the appearance of a movement or industry trend. It's further unfortunate when those to whom this term is being marketed recoil with laughter and amusement at its implications, forcing its purveyors to double down and attempt to re-assert control over the meaning of a term which may please analysts and folks with Twitter accounts who fashion themselves ""thought leaders,"" but whose roots and meaning are firmly in marketing rather than industry and art.<p>So let's talk about the marketing term ""No-Ops.""<p>In AppFog's attempt to assert a meaning over the marketing term, we're told that it means ""developers can code and let a service deploy, manage and scale their code."" I have yet to meet a single company facing a sizable technical challenge whose performance and availability needs could be met by a strait-jacket PaaS with an autoscale button. I'm not saying that many smaller companies don't use such services successfully – that's very much true. But let's be clear: the dream of push-button autoscaling while letting ""somebody else"" handle deployment, monitoring, instrumentation, and anything that may go wrong in the middle of the night is a marketing dream. As engineers, we have a business need and emotional need to own our availability [1]. Placing the sum total of your operations into a PaaS providers hands, biting down hard on that marketing dream of NoOps, and throwing the pager out the window doesn't mean you have nothing to worry about. It just means that you don't care, and can do nothing about it.<p>But it's not enough to stop there. Instead, the author sees fit to posit his / her marketing term as the <i>continuation of a history</i> in the evolution of web operations, and proclaim that the term is one that ""traditional operations"" personnel revile. If ""No-Ops"" is a success of any sort, it's a marketing win, not a technical one – and certainly not an operational one. If you think that you can place every single egg in your company's basket in the hands of PaaS providers and never worry again until you have to twiddle the auto-scale dial after which everything will be fine, you're only fooling yourself.<p>Who will migrate data on an oversubscribed Postgres shard to two more shards by night by partitions of account IDs? Who will enable dual-writes, run a migration, then cut over reads as we move into Riak? Who will notice a spike in await on the Kafka RAID, recognize the week-over-week trends pointing to your team running out of iops, order, and rack a set of new boxes with SSDs before it's too late? Who's watching the switches and keeping track of which racks have GigE and which have 10GigE uplinks to the next rack to avoid oversubscribing the network?<p>It's rare in our industry to see a promise so removed from reality. Indeed, if NoOps is a movement at all, it's powered only by the dream of not having to do one's job which is to ensure that a company is able to deliver on their business value. Who among us isn't tempted by such a promise?

3543426,comment,3537888,3542609,1,0,batista,,,"<i>Well, this is the thing, it is pretty much a physical law. Information is nonrival: it is infinitely copyable and anyone can use it without reducing access to anyone else. The effort and work to produce information is a scarcity, but once the information is expressed and public it is an abundance.</i><p>The problem is that this ""scarcity"" (to produce information) wants to be compensated too. And it's not only ""scarcity"", it's also costly to produce information. The fact that you can make 1 billion copies of Adobe Photoshop for free, for example, does not mean Adobe Photoshop itself costs nothing. It costs something like several tens of millions to make in programmer's salaries. Those paying those millions should get to dictate how you pay for it, like the guy that makes a chair gets to dictate how you pay for his chair.<p>You seem to think that the scarcity of infomation production means nothing at all, when you say e.g.:<p><i>Paying people for work done to create makes sense. It makes an 'economic' structure that mirrors the basic physical constraints. And it is justified according to its 'economic' effects. You give something up, you get something in return.</i><p>When you buy Photoshop, it's not just bytes downloaded to your PC you get, which cost nearly nothing (= your ISP bill), you ALSO get a slice of the paid, hard, work of hundreds of people in return.<p>Why are we confusing technological feasibility (free copies are feasible) what what ought to be done (compensate the creator or not)?<p>A crazy idea to directly make the software sale more akin to a specific item sale (a chair):<p>The software maker sets an arbitrary total aggregate expected sale price P and a selling goal (say, X units). Anyone buying before X units are sold pays P/X. For anyone buying after it, the price falls P/X+ (and the first buyers are also given their difference back, either directly or in ""store credit""). In the end, if they sell a billion copies, people get the program for say a dollar, but it's OK, because the company is compensated. Actually, this makes popular items essentially free or dirt cheap in the end. For this to work, we need a marketplace like the Mac App Store, so those transactions and record-keeping can be automated.<p>This restricts the artificially huge profits made by controlling the price, and puts a set price to a free copyable item, like a tangible item has, that reflects the work that went into it. It also keeps the risk of the original sale, i.e if the sell < X, they have a loss.<p><i>None of that much holds for paying for copies. The transaction is not fair and square, it is an unwarranted and unjust restriction of personal freedom of those using the information. And as for the global gain, it seems rather lacking grounds of actual evidence.</i><p>Well, the global IP industry, sales of software, music, books, magazines, etc, is on the level of trillions of dollars. It would be almost zero with totally free copying. So, at the economic level, there is some support for ""global gain"". And it's not like the culture would be poorer if less Metallica and Lady Gaga albums where freely torrented (yes, I'm a snob like that ;-).",1328201357

If your smartphone camera app records your GPS location when you take a picture and stores it in EXIF metadata, whenever you upload or SMS or otherwise share that photo, this geo-location information can be used without your knowledge.<p>The app is available from Android Market at<p>http://market.android.com/details?id=com.greenantlabs.geostripper<p>I am looking for any and all feedback, no matter how small.<p>More information:<p>When you upload your photos to Facebook we know that they DO strip EXIF GPS data out of photos they place in your albums. What we don't know is whether they actually store that geo-location information elsewhere once its removed from the photos. Other services such as Twitter, etc may not even strip the geo data and thus make your location available to anyone who has access to your posted photos (sometimes the whole world).<p>The idea was that I do not want people to change their use of their favorite message/sharing/social applications, so  GeoStripper is a man-in-the-middle application that will strip Geo tags in real time before sharing your photos (but will leave the original photos untouched). This is only possible on Android where you can substitute default behavior based on 'Intents'. GeoStripper responds to 'Pick a Photo' intent.<p>When you want to share a photo via SMS or some internet application, you need to select the photo first. Since GeoStripper now responds to that 'Intent', an option to choose between ""Select a Picture"" applications and GeoStripper will be amongst those choices\n(At this point you can set it to be a default choice)<p>When you run GeoStripper for the first time, you will be presented with an Introduction screen which briefly explains how it works and then you will proceed to the Configuration screen.<p>Configuration screen currently provides a single option -- to choose a Gallery application that will be used by GeoStripper next time you launch it. It will be populated by system's default app, but you are free to choose other ones if you have them installed.<p>From now on the only way to get into the Configuration screen is to launch GeoStripper as a standalone application (from the App Drawer).<p>If you choose GeoStripper when trying to select a photo from another application, it will take you directly the Gallery application that you selected in the GeoStripper Configuration screen. At this point, when you select a photo, a temporary copy of the photo is created with Geo data removed and is then passed back to the target application for you to share/sms/etc.<p>This rather simple application was written over the course of few weeks whenever time allowed. The source code(with some basic unit tests) is available at<p>https://github.com/GreenAntLabs/GeoStripper",1328199808

Either bookmarking clothes to build up a look that they will then go and buy, or bookmarking clothes to buy once they go on sale.<p>One of the things I struggle with buying clothes online is being able to look at all the things I like on the same screen and then decide what I will buy. (H+M does this well). Some retailers limit the baskets to 10 items (Next used to) so even though I'll only buy a few in the end, the only other way to compare items is to open lots of tabs.

In 2009, I was looking to start my first blog and wanted a custom domain rather than just a blogger site. I eventually settled on Thesis theme for WordPress. The existing product had great reviews and there were even people talking about a future version called Thesis 2.0 (still yet to be released) that would revolutionize blogging. Thesis offered free upgrades so why not get this product?<p>I bought Thesis and was very happy with it. At the same time I kept looking forward to the mysterious Thesis 2.0, which Thesis founder had dropped hints about without specifying exactly what it would do.   The internet blogging community got all excited by Chris Pearson's marketing (Chris Pearson is the guy who got in the public debate with WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg about whether Thesis should be violating WordPress GPL). Thesis 2.0 still never come, and now it was 2010, and then 2011. Chris Pearson's marketing team was really benefitting from the hints he had dropped about Thesis 2.0 because it brought people into the product, which helped avoid lost revenues to other custom Themes.<p>In mid summer 2011, I got an email from Chris Pearson's marketing team (Derek Halpern) telling me that Chris Pearson might (only might) give us feature previews of Thesis 2.0 in the near future. He wasn't promising releasing Thesis 2.0, only telling us he might tell us what exactly Thesis 2.0 would do. Nothing came. It's now February 2012, more than 6 months later, and they haven't told us a single word about what features Thesis 2.0 might have.<p>Last September 2011 I got sick of Thesis' marketing strategy and decided that if I wanted to do more on the internet, then I'd have to learn it myself. Through Quora, I discovered Rails and started learning that. Within 6 weeks I was able to set up different types of basic Rails applications and I haven't looked back yet. There's better blogging software for Rails (Enki) and obviously a ton of other great stuff.<p>My only question is, now that I use Heroku with Rails, do I cancel my hosting plan that I used for php sites? If Thesis 2.0 is ever released it might be something I want to use, but do you think it will ever be released, or is it just some marketing device to keep its users from drifting to other software?",1328199264

Windows Phone has a great built-in Facebook client, but when I'm viewing my status, all I can see is how many people ""Like""d it. To see who it was, I have to go to their website. Likewise, I can't add new friends from it. On WebOS (IMO the best Facebook client I've used, but I've never used the iPad app), it's fantastic but there's absolutely no Facebook Chat support anywhere in the entire OS. On Android, Facebook and Facebook Chat are two different apps. Both need to be running to get the ""full"" experience, and I'm sure there are still things missing.<p>It seems every platform is missing something, and it makes sense that they would deliberately give you basic functionality to use but require you hit their website for the full experience (and full ads).

For the past 20+ years I've been involved in IT audit and information security as an auditor and consultant, and as an information security manager. I'm technical enough that I'm currently a security-architect / sales-engineer for a large telecommunications vendor. I've tried two startups in the past (mobile robotics and security consulting). Neither were overly successful, but I learned a lot. I currently live in the upper midwest, am married (for 20+ years), have three children (ages 12-18), and make a decent living. Sounds great, right? I should be happy.<p>Here's the problem: I'm not making anything! I'm not creating! I strongly feel I'm a ""Maker"", a ""Developer"", but I may have realized this too late.<p>During the evening, I program for fun (mostly Ruby on Rails, these days, but Lisp, Python, C, and micro-controller assembly in the past). I'm not the greatest programmer, mostly because I can only do it a few hours each week (let's say ~10 hours per week), but I can get by. And, I really enjoy it. So, I'd like to do more programming. And, I'd like to do another startup. I have SaaS B2B application in mind. But, it seems at my age it is going to be impossible to shift from my current career to a programming career or to do another startup because the lifestyle change (read ""drop-in-income, at least for a while"") will be intolerable, especially for my family. Does that mean I'm done? Game over? At this point, am I doomed to sitting on the side-lines and only watching or being a cheerleader to other developers and startups? What have other professionals who have been in my situation (""golden handcuffs"") done to get around this? I've had a successful career (especially for someone who didn't complete college), but with three teenagers, it's not like I have a stash of cash available to make the transition.<p>What would you do if you were me?",1328198554

In the case of carrefour, since they are charging such high prices nowadays, what prevents a bunch of farmers to associate themselves and open their own mall to sell cheaper and regain market share? Nothing, absolutely nothing. They just can't be bothered.</i><p>Nothing? Never had any experience in retail business ownership, right?<p>For starters, because Carrefour has a HUGE cross country AND multi-national supply chain. Because of it's mass wholesale ordering it can assure killer prices and it also has money-to-burn in the bank. So, if they threaten it, it can lower it's prices for a while to compete, until it destroys them. They cannot afford do the same.<p>Second, Carrefour has the scale, which means it also has: thousands of other goods, exclusive deals, loss leaders, etc. Even if Carrefour couldn't compete on price (which it can, 200%), but had somewhat similar prices, it wouldn't make much sense for the buyer to spend gas plus time to go to two places just to buy some stuff cheaper in one, if he can get everything he wants in Carrefour.<p>Third, Carrefour with its size, get the lion's share of advertising. Which DOES matter.<p>Lastly, it's the bloody cost. It's another thing to open a retail outlet in a competitive environment, and totally another to open one where a few big mega-malls have saturated the market and killed everybody else. Uncertainty, and the ample opportunities for the big guy to crash you at will makes the move all too risk.<p>That's it, in a nutshell.

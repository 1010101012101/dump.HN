Of the best variety!<p>A couple of years ago, I made some abstract art of the inheritance structure of a large project written in a language with (extensively used) multiple inheritance, there being around 1800 classes. No one was game to produce a 15m-wide, 30cm-high wallpaper (the traditional type) of it, so I just removed the class names, leaving classes just dots and made it my computer&#x27;s wallpaper. It&#x27;s got quite a few comments. Still, it was nowhere near as pretty as this.",1381215599

BTW the user-level security and what was called &quot;encryption&quot; that was also supported in MDB format is no better. This encryption (which was based on 32-bit RC4) was so weak it was renamed &quot;encoding&quot; in Access 2003. All of these was ditched with the Access 2007 ACCDB format and replaced with real encryption based on CryptoAPI RC4 encryption (as termed is MS-OFFCRYPTO) introduced in Office XP (they did not adopt the new encryption introduced in Office 2007 file formats until Access 2010).",1381215484

He finally solved this problem via Bitcoin.<p>He wanted to operate in the EU because his new business concept was based on the very strict consumer protection law in Germany (in particular, the UsedSoft v Oracle ruling).<p>So from this story I learned:<p>1) that Bitcoin is very handy, and<p>2) that strict consumer protection laws are not only good for customers, but can also be good for business.<p>But I don&#x27;t see how this story makes a good case for DRM.

But it&#x27;s worth noting that Oakland has some of the highest property and sales tax rates in what is already a highly taxed state. And as a reward, it has some of the highest crime rates in the country. 
So I could understand if someone thought that increasing tax rates was not a particularly effective way to increase public safety.",1381213706

That is empirical data.<p>You say that long-running servers that don&#x27;t have startup cost constraints will perform better in Java, particularly when there is concurrency.  Why then, is the entire web served by web servers written in C/C++ (Apache, IIS, nginx, LiteSpeed), mail servers written in C/C++ (Exim, Postfix, qmail, Sendmail, Microsoft), DNS servers written in C/C++ (BIND, PowerDNS), and database servers written in C/C++ (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, Riak)?<p>You attempt to explain all this away, as if OS&#x27;s, VMs, web browsers, etc (which you admit are better off written in C or C++) are somehow different from the applications you work on, and that somehow the Java you write in your applications would be hard to beat in C++.<p>The only &quot;data&quot; you have offered is your own personal experience of working in the defense industry.  A couple problems though.  First of all you never write the &quot;same&quot; 2+ MLOC system twice, you&#x27;ll always use the lessons gained from the first go at the second design.  Something tells me you wrote the C++ version first.  Your experience is also something that we can&#x27;t see for ourselves, and involves lots of variables that we can&#x27;t evaluate.  It seems likely that your company didn&#x27;t have a strong culture of best practices in C++, or maybe just weren&#x27;t that good at it.  Your C++ design might have had lots of opportunities for improvement that good C++ people would immediately recognize.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to write good and high-performance C++ when you have a good set of guidelines like the Google C++ style guide (<a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.x...</a>) and a solid set of core libraries, but without these it&#x27;s easier to go astray.  There&#x27;s no doubt that Java&#x27;s reasonable set of &quot;batteries included&quot; libraries makes this harder to screw up.<p>I can say from my brief stint in defense that I was not super impressed.  Everything was based around extremely heavy infrastructure like CORBA.  There are lots of decisions like this that can skew the results you were getting.",1381213468

It was a short article stating that the Oakland PD truancy rate was, I believe, 37%.  So, a significant portion of Oakland PD don&#x27;t show up for their shifts.  Perhaps there is a legitimate reason for this.  Unfortunately, every time I try to dig up this statistic, I just get results regarding student truancy efforts by Oakland PD.<p>Also, in 2008, Oakland PD blew $15,000 on, I believe, Screamin&#x27; Eagle exhausts for their police Harleys.  After complaints of hearing loss, they took the pipes back off, then spent $1,200 on a &#x27;study&#x27; to test whether they increased safety (they didn&#x27;t), caused hearing damage (they do), and complied with noise standards (they blatantly violate Federal noise laws, and OPD doesn&#x27;t care).  The article I&#x27;m looking at is unclear as to whether or not the $15k was in addition to the initial cost of $500 per bike, from before the hearing complaints, removal, study, and re-installation.<p>I miss a lot of things about Oakland, but Oakland PD&#x27;s antics are not among them.

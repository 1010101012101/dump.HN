2845398,comment,2844722,2845254,6,0,VanL,,,"You say ""If the patents are bogus, they would be easy to dispatch in court with prior art.""<p>this is false. Nothing is ever easy in court, and invalidating patents is especially so-by design. There is a presumption of validity that attaches by law to every issued patent. In layman's terms, that means that the deck is stacked against anyone who tries to invalidate a patent in court.<p>Further, validity in court is decided in two parts. The first part is when the judge - a 50 year old who did history or poli sci undergrad - ""construes"" the claims by deciding what they mean. This frequently leads to some marvelous interpretations of terms. At least the judge has a college education and <i>tries</i> to get it right.<p>Next, the ""facts"" about how the patent claims apply to the accused technology are determined by a jury. Distressingly often, this jury is in East Texas, where there are two undergraduate degrees and ten people who <i>have ever used the Internet</i> in the 100-person jury pool.<p>You think I'm kidding. Or exaggerating. I'm not.<p>I have often thought that I could write a legal thriller with a helping of Dan Brown-style ""all the facts and cases discussed in this book are real."" people are astounded when it is explained to them.",1312455287

2845357,comment,2845282,2845282,12,0,econgeeker,,,"All good reasons.  My reasons are:<p>-- The Apple frameworks are first class. In the past 20 years, there has never been a set of GUI frameworks that I've seen that was anywhere near as good as things are in iOS right now.  (I've not looked at android, but it being based on Java doesn't fill me with hope. A lot of what makes CocoaTouch work so well is due to Objective-C.)<p>-- You can write an app once and have it run on iOS on the iPhone, the iPod touch and the iPad.  This is really great.  No phone outsells the iPhone, no tablet outsells the iPad, and there doesn't seem to be any competition for the iPod touch.   This means ""cross platform"" or, across the spectrum development is really easy.  In fact, with some tools you can include Mac OS X in the mix, though it isn't as trivial as doing an ""iPad Port"".<p>-- The above means that you have the largest addressable market for your software.  It is true that this market is also the one that is more likely to buy software.  But, while people talk about android as a ""platform"" it really isn't, from the developers point of view.  Android ships on phones with keyboards, and much of its volume is on phones that really are just feature phones that can run apps.  IOW, they are low end cheap phones sold for little, or given away for free to people who use them only to make calls and whose  design is such that you can't really do a modern iPhone style touch app for them.   Or if you can, it involves a lot of porting.   IF the phone doesn't have a touchscreen, it doesn't matter if it's android or not, you have to do another port.<p>-- Apple has proven to be a trustworthy partner.  People like to complain about Apple and make them out like they don't treat developers well, but they really do.  All of the reviews (and the one rejection) from the Appstore review team have been fair.  Apple pays on time and reliably.  Apple sells software world wide and supports addressing a worldwide market easily.  Apple's terms are consistent and they keep expanding and improving their market.  As someone whose business is selling (rather than writing, though I do all of our development, the software is worthless if it isn't sold) having a good market is really critical to success.<p>-- The consistency of the platform means that we can have free apps or very low cost apps and not be buried in support requests.  I think this is really underestimated. On other platforms, either you're ignoring the customers, or you're dealing with innumerable bugs that show up on a particular model of device.  You don't have that fragmentation or variation on the iOS platform, and you can therefore afford to do real customer support.... though most customers contacting us are telling us how much they love our apps rather than complaining about problems.<p>-- Apple keeps giving us really news stuff to play with. They don't have fundamental problems they have to address (like androids fragmentation) and when they do give us something where they're behind (like iCloud) when they deliver it is generally a first class implementation.  I'd wish there was more sample code for iCloud  but they took their time and did it right, and I appreciate that.<p>Of all the platforms I've developed for this has been the best so far.  So, while there might be some financial advantage to developing for android as well, I don't really see it.<p>Here's the costs that keep me off of android:<p>-- Maintaining  separate port of our software would be too much.  One set of source code for all platforms keeps us working on new features and moving the ball forward, not maintaining a another code base.<p>-- As I mentioned, we'll be able to add Mac OS X to our single code base, and that's nice.  Where we're likely to have to do a separate port is the web.  I'm much more interested in doing a web app for our customers, because then I can point everyone to it-- android users, palm users, windows phone 7 system home plus users, etc.   If I'm going to support an incompatible platform, its going to be the web.<p>-- Java.  Frankly, at one time Java was my favorite language... but having worked with Objective-C, erlang and other languages, I've grown to hate it.  It is ... bureaucratic, for lack of a better term.  Like nails on a chalkboard now.<p>-- I don't see the market there for apps. The quality of the market in which we'd sell, and the quality of the customers doesn't seem like it would produce a worthwhile return on our investment.  Sure, angry birds can do well, but that's a different kind of situation, that app is a phenomenon.",1312454116

I can comment on patents generally, though.<p>I am a patent lawyer specializing in patent reexamination - i.e., my day-to-day job is evaluating and invalidating patents.<p>There is a lot of truth to what you say that what a patent ""covers"" is grossly misrepresented in the technical press. There is some justification for the popular misinterpretation of claim scope, though; I can't tell you how many people discover, years later, that they have ""invented"" wifi - or VPNs - or any other successful standard you might care to name.<p>One good example of this is the RIM v. NTP case. The NTP patents were about pagers. It was later that they realized that they had ""invented"" email (i.e. sending electronic messages to a hand-held device). When you read the original disclosure, though, it is obvious they had no such thing in mind.<p>Further, you are right that most patents have more complexity than the high level summary would indicate.

Krugman, to pick an example, calculated that high unemployment rates would cause us to miss out on at least $3 trillion of wealth creation, and he called for about $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment. The government would capture perhaps 25% of the restored growth in taxes, so the federal government would come out at least $750 billion behind. But in theory, America as a whole would be wealthier. (All numbers from memory.)<p>The actual ""stimulus"" consisted of about $700 billion, of which maybe $350 billion was actually spent on things that Krugman thought would help the economy. He predicted that this was far too small to have any real impact, and that we would therefore spend years in a weak economy. (We later spent additional money on unemployment insurance; I don't know how this affects the models.)<p>So while you could very easily disagree with Krugman's theory, his models accurately predicted the results of the stimulus: A minor, temporary boost that would be insufficient to actually fix anything. So at least one high-profile Keynesian called it correctly, although you might argue that he just got lucky.<p>Personally, I don't know enough economics to have an informed opinion on my own. But we have at least 15 million Americans who <i>should</i> be creating wealth, and who are currently sitting around doing nothing. I'd love to see that get fixed, especially because the last 20 years of Japanese history suggests that if we alternate between rounds of weak stimulus and austerity measures, we might be stuck in this economy for decades.",1312453725

One of my great frustrations with the likes of Slashdot was how people would only read the title and say ""they're patenting computer games"", etc., like you said. However, couple of clarifications ...<p>><i>People seem to presume that patents are on ideas, and that people are patenting really obvious ideas.</i><p>Patents _are_ on ideas. Sure you need to demonstrate an implementation but the patent, assuming it's been drafted at all well, will cover more than one implementation. It covers an area of implementations that fit in with the idea being protected. This is why patent claims have ""fixing means"" instead of ""screws""/""nails""/""glue""/....<p>><i>I'm responsible for some claims on one of these patents</i><p>Do you mean responsible for the invention that the claims cover or for drafting the claims? If you're responsible for the invention then you have a legal right in most jurisdictions to be named as inventor on the patent.<p>Finally, probably the most important point. As you say, you can sneak things past the examiner. This is in one way a bad idea because getting an invalid patent <i>should</i> be worthless. But here's the rub: invalid patents are worth a lot against people who don't have millions to spend on negotiations/court or don't have huge patent portfolios to bargain with.<p>An invalid patent could prevent a startup from entering a field unless they have funds up front to challenge the company/inventor holding the patent.<p>Ensuring that patents have a very high degree of validity out of the gate is vital to avoid negatively impacting innovation IMO.",1312453284

There simply would not be an incentive to bring this sort of litigation if not for this, and companies would likely get away with these kinds of only-slightly-harmful practices. By bringing this sort of class action, the damages can be large enough that the defendant is forced to rethink their actions and make a change in their behavior.<p>Without class action, the damages would be small enough that the company could ignore it (because so few people were suing), or the legal system would be flooded with an inordinate number of duplicate cases in order to bring an appreciable amount of damage to the defendants.<p>That said, it would be nice to see some sort of restriction on legal fees, or on who is allowed to bring class action suits (perhaps only consumer advocacy groups, as is true elsewhere in the world).",1312453274

That means that the programmer has the additional burden of determining whether he may put a newline at some point in code without it being interpreted as a statement terminator.

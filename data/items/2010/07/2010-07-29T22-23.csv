It is even more sad that these titles turn out to be the best way to capture people's attention.

I have a lot (and long ago disabled toolbars, menus, etc.) but occasionally using coworkers' emacs, and using 'zile' on my OpenWRT routers and the like, means that I like to be able to remember the emacs defaults for most of the common things. :)",1280441108

One thing to bear in mind if you take this approach is that as long as you have a couple of good projects, quantity is more important than quality especially if you're new.  It shows that you like what you do, and if nothing else shows that you've at least gotten some of your crappy code out of the way.",1280441038

Why not look at the whole thing, which is a lot more nuanced (for Stallman) and kind of interesting?<p><i>Tax software can and should be released by the state under a free license. But when the state fails to do its duty, the community do the job.<p>In Brazil, FSF Latin America releases free software for filing tax returns, and this year managed to release the free program before the state released its nonfree program. So don't say it's impossible.<p>I don't like to talk about ""consumption"" of these programs because that term adopts the narrow mindset of economics. It tends to judge everything only in terms of practical costs and benefits and doesn't value freedom.<p>The reason I don't use nonfree software is that it would take away my freedom. I don't want to let that happen. So I don't consider installing nonfree program, even as an possible option. I treat them as poison. I hope that you will too.<p>I don't know whether our community will make a ""high end video game"" which is free software, but I am sure that if you try, you can stretch your taste for games so that you will enjoy the free games that we have developed.</i>",1280440960

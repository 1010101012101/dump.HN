But if you launch first, the latecomers are described as ""justin.tv."" People need a name to talk about something, and if you're doing something there's no name for, they just use the name of whoever was first.",1174928025

They all seem to be organized by the funders or by people who are out to make a buck on the conference itself.  A conference organized by startups with their interests in mind  i.e. no $1500 presentation fees, would potentially still attract investors/press/etc.  without having to have the impreteur of some internet celebrity organizing it.   Its almost like the word 'startup' itself has enough celebrity around it now to pull its own weight. <p>We should have it in some decidely non-startup hub, like Hartford CT or something...",1174927923

Innovation means to recombine old technologies for a new purpose.<p>Technology companies invent. Technical companies innovate.<p>Advice: Don't be a technology company. Profits are a function of how much people want your product, not how much you spend on R&D. If you can make something people want for zero R&D, versus making something people want that requires a huge investment, the intelligent choice should be obvious.<p>This is the premise of Seth Godin's book Free Prize Inside. That is, you could spend 50 million dollars inventing a new cereal that will double sales if it succeeds (but will most likely fail), or you could double sales just by putting a free prize inside.

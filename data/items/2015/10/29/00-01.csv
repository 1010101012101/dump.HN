The difference being that in an alternative universe, where Convergence is used, a rogue notary doesn&#x27;t destroy the trust of the entire system. When Symantec is a rogue notary, oh well, Mozilla and Google push out an update and no one uses Symantec anymore, their notary just becomes irrelevant. However, in this reality, the darkest timeline, deciding to stop trusting Symantec immediately breaks 30% of HTTPS websites on the internet, so even though Symantec has given everyone plenty of reasons to stop trusting them, we have no choice. Same for Comodo, their notary would have stopped being used in 2011 (after their root certificate compromise).<p>Instead, with Comodo and Symantec combined, we now have over 60% of HTTPS websites secured by authorities who are incompetent and/or dishonest.",1446080355

10468538,comment,10465342,10468474,0,0,cryptoz,,,"The Samsung Galaxy S4 has both a thermometer and a hygrometer (as well as a barometer). Samsung removed both of those sensors for the S5 in order to waterproof the phone - they were able to keep the barometer while still waterproofing, which is neat. Someone else might have to answer how that part of it works (something about watertight and airtight having different physical requirements..?)<p>In fact, every phone does have a thermometer, but that is not usually accessible by developers and it does not measure the actual air temperature - it&#x27;s used by the phone to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get too hot from the battery or CPU. We might not see many app-level thermometers get added to phones because the data is extremely difficult to use. For example, most of the time it will measure the temperature in your pocket or in the room where the phone is - and even then, the reading will be radically affected by what the phone is doing (browsing the web is going to cause a different temperature reading compared to watching a video, compared to stand-by mode).<p>I do expect that we&#x27;ll see more hygrometers and thermometers and other sensors make their way into phones as time goes on, but I think the primary reason for the slow take-off is because the data is really really hard to use. That&#x27;s the thing with the barometer - it&#x27;s very resilient to noise and even when the data has problems, they are fixable.",1446080106

10468534,comment,10458318,10462441,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Here&#x27;s a nice intro by Adapteva:<p><a href=""http://www.adapteva.com/andreas-blog/semiconductor-economics-101/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adapteva.com/andreas-blog/semiconductor-economics...</a><p>Far as cost, it depends on how you do it. There&#x27;s three ways to do it:<p>1. FPGA-proven design done by volunteers that&#x27;s ported to a Structured ASIC by eASIC or Triad Semiconductor.<p>2. Standard Cell ASIC that&#x27;s done privately.<p>3. Standard Cell ASIC that&#x27;s done in academia whose OSS deliverables can be used privately.<p>Option 1 will be the cheapest and easiest. An example of these are here:<p><a href=""http://www.easic.com/products/90-nm-easic-nextreme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.easic.com/products/90-nm-easic-nextreme/</a><p><a href=""http://www.triadsemi.com/vca-technology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.triadsemi.com/vca-technology/</a><p>These are a lot like FPGA&#x27;s, although Triad adds analog. The idea is there&#x27;s a bunch of pre-made logic blocks that your hardware maps to. Unlike FPGA&#x27;s, the routing is done with a custom layer of metal that only includes (or powers) necessary blocks. That lets it run faster, with less power, and cheaper. &quot;Cheaper&quot; is important given FPGA vendors recover costs with high unit prices.<p>The S-ASIC vendors will typically have premade I.P. for common use cases (eg ethernet) and other vendors&#x27; stuff can target it. Excluding your design cost and I.P. costs, the S-ASIC conversion itself will be a fraction of a full ASIC&#x27;s development costs. I don&#x27;t know eASIC&#x27;s price but I know they do maskless prototyping for around $50,000 for 50 units. They&#x27;ll likely do a six digit fee upfront with a cut of sales, too, at an agreed volume. Last I heard, Triad is currently picky about who they work with but cost around $400,000.<p>Option 2 is the easier version of real-deal: an actual ASIC. This basically uses EDA tools to create, synthesize, integrate, and verify an ASIC&#x27;s components before fabbing them for real testing. The tools can be $1+ mil a seat. Mask & EDA costs are the real killer. Silicon itself is cheap with packaging probably around $10-30 a chip with minimum of maybe 40 chips or so. Common strategies are to use smart people with cheaper tools (eg Tanner, Magma back in day), use older nodes whose masks are cheaper (350nm/180nm), license I.P. from third parties (still expensive), or build the solution piecemeal while licensing the pieces to recover costs. Multi-project wafers (MPW&#x27;s) to keep costs down. What that does is split a mask and fab run among a number of parties where each gets some of the real estate and an equivalent portion of cost. 350nm or 180nm are best for special purpose devices such as accelerators, management chips, I/O guards, etc that don&#x27;t need 1GHz, etc. 3rd-party license might be no go for OSS unless it&#x27;s dual-licensed or open-source proprietary. Reuse is something they all do. All in all, on a good node (90nm or lower), a usable SOC is going to cost millions no matter how you look at it. That said, the incremental cost can be in hundreds of thousands if you re-use past I.P. (esp I/O) and do MPW&#x27;s.<p>Company doing MPW with cool old node + 90nm memory trick on top:<p><a href=""http://www.tekmos.com/products/asics/process-technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tekmos.com/products/asics/process-technologies</a><p>Option 3 is academic development. The reason this is a good idea is that Universities get <i>huge</i> discounts on EDA tools, get significant discounts on MPW&#x27;s at places like MOSIS fabrication service, and may have students smart enough to use the tools while being much cheaper than pro&#x27;s. They might work hand-in-hand with proprietary companies to split the work between them or at least let pro&#x27;s assist the amateurs. I&#x27;ve often pushed for our Universities to make a bunch of free, OSS components for cutting edge nodes ranging from cell libraries to I/O blocks to whole SOC&#x27;s. There&#x27;s little of that but occasional success stories. Here&#x27;s two standard cell ASIC&#x27;s from academia: a 90nm microcontroller and (my favorite) teh 45nm Rocket RISC-V processor which was open-sourced.<p><a href=""http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:8a569a87-a972-480c-bd7d-11292b3f5cdc/ewi_Gomez_2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:8a569a87-a972-480c-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/riscv-esscirc2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/papers/riscv-esscirc201...</a><p>Note: Those papers will show you the ASIC Standard Cell process flow and tools that cane be involved. The result was awesome with Rocket.<p>So, enough academics doing that for all the critical parts of SOC&#x27;s could <i>dramatically</i> reduce costs. My proposal was to do each I/O (where possible) on 180nm, 90nm, 45nm, and 28nm. The idea being people moving their own work down a process node could just drop-in replacements. The I/O and supplementary stuff would be almost free so that let&#x27;s developers focus on their real functionality.<p>My other proposal was a free, OSS FPGA architecture with a S-ASIC and ASIC conversion process at each of the major nodes. Plenty of pre-made I.P. as above with anyone able to contribute to it. Combined with QFlow OSS flow or proprietary EDA, that would <i>dramatically</i> reduce OSS hardware cost while letting us better see inside.<p>Archipelago Open-Source FPGA\n<a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-43.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-43...</a><p>Note: Needs some improvements but EXCITING SHIT to finally have one!<p>Qflow Open-source Synthesis Flow\n<a href=""http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/</a><p>Synflow open-source HDL and synthesis\n<a href=""http://cx-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cx-lang.org/</a><p>Note: I haven&#x27;t evaluated or vetted Synflow yet. However, the I.P. is the only ones I&#x27;ve ever seen for under $1,000. If they&#x27;re decent quality, then there must be something to their method and tools, eh?<p>So, there&#x27;s your main models. Both commercial and academic one might benefit from government grants (esp DARPA/NSF) or private donations from companies/individuals that care about privacy or just cheaper HW development. Even Facebook or Google might help if you&#x27;re producing something they can use in their datacenters.<p>For purely commercial, the easiest route is to get a fabless company in Asia to do it so you&#x27;re getting cheaper labor and not paying for full cost of tools. This is true regardless of who or where: tools paid for in one project can be reused on next for free as you pay by year. Also, licensing intermediate I.P. or selling premium devices can help recover cost. Leads me to believe open-source proprietary, maybe dual-licensed, is the best for OSS HW.<p>So, hope there&#x27;s enough information in there for you.",1446080056

Switching jobs is likely to be the most straightforward way to achieve this salary bump.<p>We&#x27;re mutually financially savvy with regards to investment returns, right?  $5k invested today increases your safe withdraw rate in retirement by approximately $5k per year.  You need <i>a lot</i> more.  There is no investment available for purchase on the open market such that $5k transformatively changes your retirement scenario, even 30+ years out.<p>You need about ~$200k++ to contemplate buying most franchises, and hiring a manager for them eats most of the revenue if you&#x27;re only doing it for one.  (Someone who owns one Subway pays a lot of money for the privilege of cutting a lot of bread.  Someone who owns ten Subways does pretty decently for themselves.)<p>Side projects are an option, and a few thousand bucks is (more than) enough to launch many of them.  (Say, writing an e-book on a technical subject.)  Getting the salary upgrade strikes me as an easier bet to make, though.  If you want to go the side-project route, there exists a wealth of information on previous HN threads/etc about the mechanics of selling e-books.<p>Short version: start collecting emails immediately, write about the eventual topic of the book for public consumption, continue collecting email addresses, begin writing book, continue writing public content and updates to mailing list, finish writing book, launch with three price tiers at $50/$99/$249, promote to email list, make $X0k with fairly high degree of certainty, invest in retirement, rest a bit, continue growing list and watering it with regular emails, write another book on related subject, repeat.<p>There&#x27;s a related SaaS-y method, the mechanics of which are quite similar to ebooks but the execution cycle is much, much longer in the typical case when doing it as a side project.<p>Modest success story: I&#x27;d be behind the curve on retirement savings but for bingo and burritos.  I made an app which made bingo cards, made a very modest amount of money with it, and put a few thousand dollars into a little company which makes burritos: <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CMG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CMG</a>  (Scroll back to 2006~2008, when I was still at the day job and hence able to sock away most of my bingo earnings.)<p>That&#x27;s very not reproducible, but was a happy accident.

In C++, it&#x27;s common for contained structs to be flat in memory, so accessing a data member in them is just an offset from a base address.  In Java, all Object types are really pointers, which you need to dereference to get the contained object.

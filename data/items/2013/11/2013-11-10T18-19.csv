6707881,comment,6707666,6707666,56,0,denzil_correa,,,"There are many reasons why one would remember William Henry Gates - Microsoft, technology et al. But, I would remember Bill for his life after Microsoft via his philanthropy. He&#x27;s having an unprecedented impact on global society in energy, health care, education and many more areas which are too many to list. Even his worst of technology critics (like me) can&#x27;t hide away from the fact of his impact on modern society.<p>I was reading the 2013 Annual letter from Bill Gates as part of Gates Foundation [0]. Each word in the report is magnificently detailed and precise. Gates foundation has helped &quot;almost&quot; completely eradicate polio with lesser than 1000 reported cases in the world. This is pretty amazing! If and when polio would be completely wiped out of the face of this earth, it would just be the second disease to be wiped out. Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries with children affected by polio.  I also see a sharp decline in child-birth cases. This report is a MUST read and if possible do your bit to support the Gates foundation.<p>Even if he doesn&#x27;t do a single thing from now on - Bill Gates has earned his RESPECT with not only his impact in technology but life outside technology. Personally, I would always remember Bill as the philanthropist rather than the tech-wizard.<p>[0] <a href=""http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/pdf/2013_AL_English.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/pdf/2013_AL_English....</a>",1384109945

6707866,comment,6706125,6706125,3,0,eof,,,"I agree with most of the problems listed here; but am just as certain of there being long-term viability for alt-coins as I was of bitcoin several years ago.<p>I am surprised though that the author did not make, what to me, is the most obvious and strong argument for or against alt-coins, namely; `there can only be one--per hashing algorithm`.<p>The problem with alt-coins that share bitcoin&#x27;s mining algorithm is that they are inherently insecure; as bitcoin&#x27;s hashing power can be used to 51% attack the alt-coins directly; which is inevitable if the alt-coin is profitable to mine, or if it threatens bitcoin&#x27;s dominance.<p>Consider an alt-coin that is less profitable than bitcoin to mine; people won&#x27;t mine it.  Consider again an alt-coin that is more profitable than bitcoin to mine; miners will hash the alt-coin until it is less profitable (profitablility is a direct correlation between hashing power and price-per-coin; as more hashing power chases a static amount of coins, profitability drops)--this dooms any alt-coin that both shares a hashing algorithm with a more established crypto-coin and does not solve any fatal flaw.<p>For this reason, I think litecoin will have long term success; while feathercoin (et al) are doomed; bitcoin hashing power cannot be pointed at litecoin.  Total network hashing power is very analogous to mass and gravity; like draws like in this regard, the more hashing power pointed at a block-chain, the more secure it is, the more peopel trust it, the value it will have, the more people will mine it.<p>There is room for infinite crypto-coins, despite the authors hand-waviness around bitcoin competing &quot;with the dollar and paypal&quot;; fiat currencies have shown (to the most freshman of history buffs) to be exploited for the benefit of the elite at the expense o the masses; something a well-designed cryptocoin (bitcoin included) cannot be subject to.  People will choose to use cryptocoins as their benefits become more viscerally tangible; and competing blockchains will forever come in and out; and some will stay.<p>But, if you ever want to bootstrap your <i>own</i> blockchain; you must use a new hashing algorithm or it is doomed.",1384109683

6707863,comment,6706513,6707676,3,0,ars,,,"> Intelligence is not magic, and in some way almost definitely scales with computing power.<p>The <i>speed</i> of intelligence scales. But not the <i>quality</i> of it.<p>The quality of intelligence is something very hard to quantify. But as simply as I can state it, it&#x27;s the quality of coming up with an idea that is not just an extension of an existing one, but an idea that came seemingly from nowhere. To someone else the idea appears magic, and no amount of thinking by that other person can lead him in a path that will end up there.<p>> but they are an indication that such a thing could be possible.<p>Real genius is not just &quot;more&quot; intelligence, it&#x27;s intelligence of a different <i>type</i> that a non-genius simply can not do, no matter how they try. Analogously, just because a computer can do something fast does not give it that hard to define quality of true intelligence.<p>To make (rather than randomly search for) a computer with real intelligence we need to understand what it is, and where it comes from, and we don&#x27;t know either one of those things. Our best (smartest) computers are all variations of &quot;search randomly&quot; (for example chess engines). Those can do some amazing things, but their limitations will not be overcome by doing more of the same.<p>> infinite computing power .. every possible<p>Talking about infinity is a total red herring and you know that - especially because if your method of increasing intelligence is &quot;search randomly&quot; then an AI will not be able to make a better AI - all it can do is continue the random search humans already started.",1384109632

6707857,comment,6702535,6707197,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"<i>Is putting a battery-powered pump in a water gun a non-obvious invention worthy of patent protection? Batteries, pumps and water guns all existed before this -- what&#x27;s the innovation here?</i><p>This is an excellent question.  Let me offer a possible answer.<p>It seems to me that the very fact that batteries, pumps, and water guns had all existed for some time, and yet nobody until Johnson thought to put them together, in itself constitutes evidence that the idea was nonobvious.<p>It seems to me that a lot of the problem patents we have seen in recent years involve relatively new technologies.  For example, once we had low-cost scanners, and once file transmission by email became common, scan-to-email was an obvious idea.  But it wasn&#x27;t <i>so</i> obvious that one of the first people to think of it (almost certainly not the very first) wasn&#x27;t able to obtain a patent on it.  Therein, I think, lies the problem: when a new technology shows up, the PTO simply has no way to know what applications of it count as obvious -- it hasn&#x27;t been around long enough for the obvious ones to have been thought of already.<p>Under such circumstances the PTO should be very careful about granting patents.  I think a reasonable guideline would be that once a new technology begins to be widely used, the PTO should assume that any idea that simply combines the new technology with existing techniques, or applies it to well-known problems in a straightforward way, is obvious.  This would have ruled out all the &quot;X, but on the Internet&quot; patents we have seen go by.<p>As I have written previously, a deeper problem with our system is this.  A patent is a trade: we give the inventor a time-limited monopoly in exchange for disclosure of the invention.  But there&#x27;s no one unambiguously charged with making sure we got a good deal: that the value of the disclosure outweighs the cost of the monopoly.  While this is technically the PTO&#x27;s responsibility, its management and incentive structures aren&#x27;t set up with this goal paramount.  This pushes the problem to the courts; but the courts tend to defer to the PTO&#x27;s judgment.  So really, there&#x27;s nobody minding the store.",1384109527

First of all, you dismiss it as an irrational fantasy. How would you feel about my opinion of your &quot;compulsion&quot; if I dismissed it as an irrational brand of paranoia?

Your country has a great combination of a shitty healthcare system that is well known to fail the mentally ill (unlike the functioning healthcare systems of other countries) and wide availability of firearms.

Reduce the number of guns and increase the number of services taking care of the mentally ill. How to diagnose them? The same way as in every other country.<p>> <i>The problem with such naivete is that it assumes the problem is theoretical, and merely needs the correct sociological constructions and psychological theory implemented by benevolent institutions.</i><p>No, the problem is deeply practical: how to have less violence both from the inside and from the outside. The solution is deeply practical too: take better care of the mentally ill who tend to become mass murderers so they are in hospitals shooting valium instead of in school shooting toddlers, and don&#x27;t do the multiply fucked up foreign policy things the US does that result in crazy people outside of the US wanting to cause it trouble.<p>> <i>But how do those institutions grow over time? Who governs them, and which of the many competing and contradictory sociological and psychological models do we apply, first of all to define and identify &quot;crazy,&quot; and then to apply the appropriate remedy? Further, what concrete example of such an application can you offer as proof that such a program works consistently on the local individual level, much less the international level?</i><p>See earlier point about how other countries &quot;identify&quot; mentally ill people.

For example, a web server module can declare that it exports a URL endpoint that needs to be monitored. Then the Nagios module can declare that it wants to know about all URLs to be monitored.

Recently students at Brown University shouted down a former NYC police commissioner[2] that came to speak at the campus, calling him a &quot;racist&quot; in response to NYC&#x27;s very successful stop-and-frisk policy designed to get illegal guns off the street.<p>Its really clear you have very little background on stop and frisk and crime in NYC in general. For the last few decades, violent crime has been a decline in NYC, predating stop and frisk. Stop and frisk has not been demonstrated to be a key factor in that decline. Stop and frisk has been shown to be 2 things: ineffective and racist. Non white people get stopped at extremely high rates and actual stop and frisk stops that uncover an illegal weapon is very low. Ray Kelly was a key proponent of stop and frisk and in suppressing and attempting to hide the statistical data about stop and frisk that clearly shows it is a racist policy that seeks to harass black and hispanic people in NYC.<p>> It used to be said that the antidote to bad speech was more speech.

Objective-C protocol is nothing about type, but defines nice interface for tooling support. Go interface defines set of promises, so actual object structure doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Furthermore, recent languages offer automatic type inference - Haskell, Go, C++11. They force to retain type information, but also permit to elide them where accurately inference-able/deduce-able.<p>This is completely different with not forcing type notion such as Python, Ruby, Lua, JS.

My first reaction is to wonder how it would work with the more complicated tests you typically encounter in real-world JavaScript.<p>For example, see [1]. This is a very simple example of testing a JavaScript drawing app. (It&#x27;s from my Let&#x27;s Code JavaScript screencast [2].) In this example, you&#x27;ll see several things that don&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;d work well with inline tests:<p>1. Common setup and teardown. The tests work against the browser DOM, so there&#x27;s `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` functions that set up and clean up the DOM. The `afterEach()` function is particularly valuable because it runs even when exceptions occur. How would common setup and teardown be handled with inline tests?<p>2. Multiple tests per function. There&#x27;s a fairly loose relationship between the tests and the functions in the production code. Instead, the tests speak to the behavior of the drawing app. If these tests were inline, how would you prevent the test code from overwhelming the production code?<p>3. Helper functions. The tests have a lot of helper functions to do things like simulate events and parse the DOM. This particular example is worse than most, but helper functions are still fairly common when testing. How do you distinguish test-specific helper functions from production functions when you&#x27;re using inline tests?<p>Overall, I wonder if inline tests would make this code harder to read, not easier.<p>I&#x27;m intrigued by the idea, so this isn&#x27;t meant to be a middlebrow dismissal, but more an invitation to explore real-world problems. Feel free to use my example code at a starting point!

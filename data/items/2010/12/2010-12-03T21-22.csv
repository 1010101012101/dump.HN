Conditions which the NYC flight could probably claim to have had ( it's a little unclear whether the on board video let them fly it outside LoS, and if it did whether they ever did fly it outside LoS.)<p>I guess my point is that it's no more ""definitely illegal"" than driving a car. There are rules and regulations, but there are many people working within those rules, and legally flying autonomous drones. Nobody says driving a car is ""definitely illegal"" because you need to have a license, a registered roadworthy car, stop at red lights and drive on the correct side of the road. The regulations do allow for autonomous rc aircraft. They don't allow for them to do 60 mile round trips to collect cookies from your Mom, but saying ""thats definitely illegal"" needs at least qualifying with something like ""except under certain constraints and conditions"" or it's at least misleading, if not outright wrong.",1291413218

As I understand it the ""Lek paradox"" doesn't apply to humans, it only applies to animals that mate in leks.<p>A ""lek"" is a kind of display where all the males compete for attention among all the females. The one who wins the lek gets to mate with <i>all</i> the females, while the others go home frustrated.

It is clearly a bigger factor when you really like something but don't have the nerve to make the plunge. And for some new investors it might be 80% of why they invest--just jump on the bandwagon, and you can brag you're in a deal with XYZ. The bandwagon effect is most pronounced when people hear that a deal is about to close. But then it's not so much WHO is doing the deal, but rather that something scarce is going to slip away, and you just have to COMMIT NOW or lose that hot deal. An entire advertising industry is built around this human need.<p>I love AngelList, (www.angel.co), it's a great source of well-vetted deal flow, but the inflow is huge, and every deal has already been sponsored or invested by someone or other.

Earlier I've made a few small game prototypes, nothing that can compare to a real, full blown game, but it's where I'd like to go someday and I can totally agree with most of the points.<p>However ""OOP rules"" is a bit dual edged for me. When I started out with prototyping these games I tried really hard to do it ""the correct way"" with loads of abstractions and with proper encapsulation and what not. Sure parts got good but I a made a lot of bloat along the way and now I could have made it a lot simpler (and better). Maybe it's because I've been spending time with Haskell and lisp (functional lisp that is) and now I'd like to ""go back"" to a more functional approach. Maybe it's because it's just a personal growth as a programmer though?<p>I might agree with the step by step approach, although I personally think it's funner (and thus more educational) to just dive in head first and make shit happen. I don't think I've ever learned as much as when I sat down and decided that yes I would finally make a working game and just jumped in head first. Break things - it's the way we (at least how I) learn.<p>Which brings me to #5:<p>""Don’t just jump at any problem and start writing code.""
Well that's a little how I do things. Maybe I don't even know exactly what the problem is before a few attempts? How would you for example solve a path finding problem in a modern RTS? A bit of forethought is vital of course, but can you really think of all the subtle problems that will come up? Or even all the big ones? I think iterate early and often is the key to game making, and it's a bit similar with problemsolving.<p>But of course that's also what he's getting at later with ""Write some basic functionality and then expand it.""
It's just that I think when I'm coding, not before.<p>Now after I wrote this I realize I agree with almost everything he said but with minor differences.",1291412428

Stuff like Asimovian Psychohistory are fun to think about, but it is a fictional story telling device. And that's a hint. History and politics are storytelling. Often based on ""true events"" only as far as convenient to the storyteller.<p>To make any useful sense of history, or politics, or nearly any ""soft"" process, humans apply a variety of heuristics, some based on experience, and others on evolution, that frankly no one really understands. At least in the sense of a testable or prediction making model.<p>If someone makes a statement, or tells me a story, I have to examine the context and the past narrative of events in order to make a judgement about its veracity. The details of how that judgement come to pass are as unknown as the nature of natural language, and I suspect they are related.<p>In other words, my process doesn't get ""bad"" results, it gets no results.  But I do get a heuristic that is somehow useful.  Sometimes.  Trying to argue about events like this, outside of the limited terms of those heuristics is pointless.  How many angels _can_ dance on the head of a pin.<p>Instead, as in a courtroom drama (another story!), we look for means, motive, and opportunity. And then like any good jury, we apply our various and variable heuristics and come up with our own story.<p>Which is a guess.<p>Whether or not you believe the story I told, within the context of rather different discussion, is irrelevant, just as how you feel about the innocence of today's murder de jour is irrelevant.

Typically, it's 5-8 years of grad school, possibly 1-3 years of a postdoc, and 6-7 years being untenured faculty. At any one stage, the odds in academia are not that bad; for example, if you're an untenured Stanford prof, your chances of becoming a tenured prof are actually quite good. But you have to make it through the whole 15-20-year process to get there.<p>As a result, startups also have more iterability: if a startup fails, you can plausibly try a second, or a third, perhaps taking totally different approaches each time. You can't really do that with an academic career path, since the time needed to get through the process and build a reputation makes it nearly impossible to decide, ""well, going for a CS faculty position at CMU didn't work, maybe I'll go back to grad school and try for a philosophy professorship at Oxford this time"".<p>On the other hand, since it's a whole career rather than a single venture, it's less clear what ""success"" or ""failure"" is for an academic career, unless you <i>really</i> have your heart set on a very specific goal. For example, if you end up not being able to get the tenured position you want, but do end up working at a research lab in industry doing interesting stuff, is that a success or failure?

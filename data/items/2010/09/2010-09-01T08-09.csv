I took Krav Maga, there were plenty of women in the class, and the techniques translate well to self defense even if you're not as big or strong as your assailant. They teach you to attack vulnerable areas - eyes and groin in particular - and how to break chokes, deal with someone trying to pick you up off the ground, things like that. Everyone who travels or otherwise has a not 100% safe routine should take 10-20 martial arts classes. Might save your life.<p>Edit: Can't resist an anecdote. There was a huge Russian instructor in one of our classes, and the class that day was about half women. He said, ""Ok, man tries to rape you? Rip his eyes, like this. See? Rip! He can't see now for rest of life? Tough shit! Should not have tried rape you.""<p>(Despite the machismo of how this might look in text, it was well received in person - a good community, good people, good training, very welcoming to everyone at any level of age or fitness.

Crashing hourly is better than a more erratic schedule; it means you can observe the crash nearly on demand.<p>I would disable the auto-restart for a couple cycles to get a closer look at the unresponsive condition: total threads, any swapping, any busy threads. It means a few more minutes downtime but more information for you.<p>It sounds like some connections are hanging indefinitely, eventually using up 'all' of some capped resource (threads, RAM, etc.).<p>Make sure you have a 'Timeout' setting in the applicable apache conf, and make it really small (10-20) to see if that helps. (You may get complaints that other long-running-requests that used to finish now fail -- but at least service will remain available for usual requests, and you can adjust the value back up later.)<p>Check the end of the error_log just after a crash/freeze for hints. Consider adjusting the conf value MaxClients up, as long as there was no swapping evident. Consider adjusting the conf value MaxRequestsPerChild down, but nonzero, so that children are recycled sooner before they grow problematic from memory leaks.",1283328131

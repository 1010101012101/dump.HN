It became cheaper to put the power plants near the fuel and move the electric power. Furthermore, it became possible to generate electricity from power sources, like great waterfalls, that could not be moved at all.<p>The moral of the story?

6778403,comment,6775330,6776837,9,0,akater,,,"> How would any closed source (secrets) Mathmatica\n> be a better option than an open source language (Sage)?\n> Really want to understand the thought process.<p>Probably because it does something Sage can&#x27;t do. I can think of several reasons why I&#x27;m attached to Mma.<p>1) It has a great help system. Having 3 to 100 examples per help entry, and a See Also section in every single one f them is invaluable, at least for me. I almost can&#x27;t use any other language&#x27;s help system after using this one, because it&#x27;s so good. Good yet simple; nothing prevents others from maintaining at least Examples-driven documentation but almost nobody does that, and I&#x27;m not aware of a single other documentation model that would include [consistently] both Examples and See Also sections. With its interactivity and tutorials on top, MMA&#x27;s DocCenter is completely unbeatable.<p>2) Sage is for mathematics, Mma is for everything. That&#x27;s what Wolfram says, and that&#x27;s what programmers usually giggle at. Ask non-programmers, like me, about it. I use Mma for everything, and I can&#x27;t imagine using Python instead. I actually feel rather weird explaining this on HN. Have you read about Blub Paradox in “Beating the Averages”? Mathematica vs Sage is Lisp vs Python. Of course I&#x27;d never use Sage. Wolfram language is really good: I use it as a basic markup for every piece of structured data that I need to write down in everyday life. I can&#x27;t think of any single alternative here: other markup languages I know of are way too clumsy for this.<p>3) Mma has a unique interface, a mix of GUI and CLI. Nobody else has that. IPython Notebooks is a (surprisingly late) attempt to mock it, but for me it looks a bit like an exercise in sympathetic magic: for example, they&#x27;ve copied In and Out labels that are actually Mma expressions, that is, a part of its language. Not that it&#x27;s an essential part but still, it looks like IPython authors were rather clueless about what they tried to imitate. Mma notebooks themsevles are written in Wolfram language while IPython Notebooks are written in that miserable excuse of a markup called JSON.<p>Mathematica is Enterprise-class emacs. It&#x27;s general, powerful, AND also user-friendly and good looking, unlike emacs. I can be sure that lots of people will use it who would never dive into a black hole of a terminal [until absolutely neccesary], yet all the power of CLI will be with them when they use Mma. Well, this sounds like the kind of people I want to write software for.<p>As for closed source, Mma is just too good for that being a crucial drawback. Besides, a truly mathematical result never depends on anything external so it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you use black boxes while producing it, or not. If only mathematical result is correct and valuable, then it /must/ be self-contained.",1385077881

Is this a libertarian haven of some kind?<p>As the article says, it&#x27;s not a libertarian stance as in Germany green lefties support legal prostitution. It&#x27;s a matter of freedom and not letting the state decide what you can do with your very own body. If you&#x27;re fine with the state telling you what you can or can&#x27;t do to your own body, good for you. But don&#x27;t force it on others. That&#x27;s just as bad as religious people forcing their opinion on others by law (prop 8, no Jews/atheists/women allowed in office etc).",1385076396
6778287,comment,6776414,6776414,10,0,gregwebs,,,"This is the only intelligent comparison I have seen of Ember & Angular (or actually of Angular with any other modern framework). Thanks!<p>I am wondering if the uniform access principle is mostly a dynamic language issue: you end up screwing up whether you need a parentheses invocation and you don&#x27;t know until runtime. If you type everything with TypeScript then you know at compile time if you messed it up. Relatedly, Ember&#x27;s get/set is more difficult to make strongly typed. In the TypeScript definitions I am looking at, property access is only typed as a string. One could define an enum for each object to be used in place of the string, but overall there is a price to pay with set/get since it isn&#x27;t baked into the language (like Ruby).",1385076393

6778283,comment,6775241,6777432,1,0,gnaritas,,,"> Once something functions as a mature currency, everything is priced against it, so it is no longer volatile.<p>The economy isn&#x27;t nearly so simple.  Pricing something in a currency doesn&#x27;t automatically make the currency stable, a stable currency comes from the currency having enough liquidity to serve as a means of exchange for the wealth it&#x27;s representing but not too much.  Any sudden increase or decrease in that represented wealth will cause demand for the currency to either increase or decrease and a currency fixed in supply cannot increase/decrease supply to match the demand so it must necessarily inflation/deflate in value instead.<p>> As a side note, your comment is bizarre. There is no reason to think a fixed supply would lead to volatility.<p>It&#x27;s not at all bizarre if you think about it, a fixed currency will always be volatile because the wealth it represents isn&#x27;t fixed, markets grow and shrink and if the currency can&#x27;t then a booming market automatically means currency deflation because that fixed amount of currency must now represent a larger amount of wealth creation.  With a fixed currency, a boom in productivity and wealth creation will cause massive deflation in the currency.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know how anyone thinks a fixed amount of currency can possibly work when the wealth it&#x27;s standing in for is not fixed.  The market cycles up and down continually and the supply of currency, if prices are to be kept stable, must also.<p>You can&#x27;t have stable prices with a fixed amount of currency, it&#x27;s not logical.  One of them will cycle to match the market&#x27;s ups and downs.  So either prices will be violate or the currency must allow inflation/deflation of the currency supply to keep prices stable.",1385076371

Having an auto-updated IDE will also be a nice change.<p>I haven&#x27;t been excited about web-based IDE&#x27;s previously as all the ones I&#x27;ve tried have been clunky and slow, but it looks like this is being built with Dart so should offer better start-up and runtime performance given it will be running natively on the DartVM inside Chrome App.<p>Looking forward to the day that I&#x27;m able to login, hassle-free to any ChromeOS PC and have instant access to my working environment.

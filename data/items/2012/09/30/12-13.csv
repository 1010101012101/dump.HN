4592756,comment,4592121,4592606,2,0,Zenst,,,"fish and chips in the UK has two interesting aspects to it.  Down south if you ask for fish and chip by default you will get cod, though up north it is by default place or anything but cod and most shop don't even have cod due to catchment area's and fish types mostly available for transport.  Was a odd one upon me first time in new castle when I asked for cod and chips.<p>Another influence is the catholic tradition in these shore for having fish on a friday.  That for many has risen to the trend of menu's having fish options on a friday and school meals and tends to focus most fish eating on a friday, nomatter the religion.<p>As a whole the general fish stocks were and still are finely balanced though the whole change with regards to the EU and having fishing trawlers from EU countries in and around the UK fishing has had further impact upon the once rich fish stocks with the north sea feeling the impact.  This and changes in ocean climate has impacted the fish into other area's due to water temperature and effects upon there food stocks.  Were still learning about weather above the oceans and as to the weather enviroment aspect under water is one were we have even more to learn and its impact and effects on the natural habitats.<p>So dont worry about the UK eating all the cod, social trends and impacts dictate we eat other fish and in general it depends on what part of the country you in as to what the popular fish eaten in that part is.<p>I will also add that having eaten North sea cod and North atlantic cod in seattle that the atlantic cod was much tastier, at least to me.<p>So don't panic we in the UK will not eat all the cod, though don't ask us about the pies :).",1349009955

4592750,comment,4592297,4592297,14,0,csaba,,,"I tried this out. I think it is really good idea, but really bad implementation. I wanted to draw something, and save it. But I had to login first. If you log in, you lost your drawing. Then I redraw it from scratch, then clicked on the save, and the server went down, so again, lost everything. Sometimes the cursor draws without any click, and ruins all your previous work, and you can't turn it off (maybe a bug). Then I tried other way. What if I just draw a small part, and save it? Before save it automatically cropped my pic for best fit (if you resize your drawing area, you lost everything).<p>So, for about the tenth time, I finally finished my ""nyan cat"", and published it, to see what's gonna happen? Some time after, I got an email, that they refused to publish it, and gave me some bullsh*t (one or more of the following) reasons. So one, or more? Why don't they tell me specifically? And some of the reasons were hurtful for someone, who tried so hard to finish something.<p>Anyway... As I sad before, I like the idea, but the implementation is pretty flawed, and painfully slow.",1349009702

It's simple, it looks good, and contrary to what others said, you actually have a pretty innovative business model with the possibility to sell crowdsourced designs. But if I were you, I'd make it more interesting for graphics guys. The real innovation would be to do a 70-30 cut like for iPhone apps. If it worked economically, even if it merely covered your costs, it would attract much better designers and many more buyers that would also buy your own designs on which you could make more profit.

Police are now said to be following a variety of other leads they hope will 'prove to be less of a hopeless time suck'.<p>""Asked why he felt detectives had singled him out and surrounded him in his remote location, Mr Steveyson said that he had been searching Boogle over a period of two months for various methods to reduce DNA evidence at crime scenes for his upcoming book.

A lot of developers are more interested in the specifics of the job, product, company etc. than the salary (once it meets a certain minimum floor); and for other jobs, the specific knowledge and experience needed is very scarce. If there are 20 people qualified for a job and 21 open positions, no salary level is going to fill all the positions.<p>I had a H-1B visa once upon a time, but I never moved to the US.

So while I disagree with the original linked article, I'm not sure you and I disagree.  :)<p>As for the studies, this is winding far afield, but there's two main ways you can do a study:  Controlled and observational.  Controlled is hard, but gives good data.  Observational is easy, but gives unreliable data, especially when relating to people.<p>To a first approximation, a controlled study can prove things about human health, while an observational study can <i>suggest</i> areas where a controlled study would be useful.<p>It's not that these studies have methodological errors (as far as I know, they don't).  It's that they're observational studies, and best case, they can't prove things in the way a controlled study would.<p>If you want a good primer on ""what are observational studies and why are they problematic for human health""...I don't actually have one handy.

2312664,comment,2312064,2312497,0,0,repiret,,,"I disagree.  Consider the following sequence of examples:<p>1. I have a store in Oregon, a US state with no sales tax.  You live in France, and while on vacation here, you buy a trinket, and carry it home in your luggage.  Clearly, I don't have to pay French sales tax.  You might owe some import duty when you bring it home.<p>2. Suppose instead that the trinket is big and heavy, so rather than putting it in your luggage, you have me mail it to you.  Its still pretty clear I shouldn't have to pay French sales tax.<p>3. When you get home, you like the trinket so much, you want a second one.  You know that your cousin will be visiting the area, so you give her money, she gives it to me, and I mail you the second trinket.  You probably still agree I don't have to pay French sales tax.<p>4. Suppose your cousin, and nobody you knew, was going to be near my store.  So instead you hire an agent to deliver me the money instead.  Now perhaps its starting to get a bit murky, but I don't see that the agent is morally different from your cousin, and the use of an agent should not avail me to French sales tax liability.<p>If that agent is named ""the postoffice"", then what we have is a typical mail-order business.  And I think you can make a good case that online business should be treated a lot like mail-order business.<p>* * *<p>Now if we repeat those examples with my store in California and you in New York, there are two differences.  First, California has sales tax, so in the first example, California sales tax would unquestionably be owed.  Second, at some point along the way to the last example, we became engaged in inter-state commerce.  The United States constitution forbids states from regulating inter-state commerce.  This has been construed to mean that mail-order business is interstate commerce, and as such, neither the state of the seller nor the state of the buyer have a right to impose sales tax.  Online business has, correctly I believe, been treated the same as mail-order.  Most states have a ""use tax"", which requires a tax be paid on new goods brought into the state for use in the state.  The problem is out of state sellers can't legally be required to collect it, or even report enough details for the state to reasonably enforce it.<p>Legal issues aside, allowing inter-state commerce to be used as a sales tax evasion scheme doesn't seem like good public policy.  But the obvious fix - collecting sales tax for the locale of the buyer - is not logistically simple: states, counties and cities can all impose their own sales tax, so across the country there are thousands of different government authorities to which sales tax must be remitted and thousands of different tax rates which are constantly changing.  Requiring every online seller to keep track of that - and exposing them to audit liability from all these different authorities, would not be beneficial to public policy either.",1299832102

The method basically works because every IDE has a similar standard set of actions, only organized differently. Vim on the other hand has its very own set of actions which does not map to any other application at all (with the possible exception for Emacs).<p>Thus, whenever a non-vimmer is watching a vimmer he only sees magic happening, but not understanding why or how. It takes an experienced vimmer to learn from other vimmers. This has happened to me a lot, but has not enlightened anyone yet. (Does this imply that IDEs are plumbing and Vim is magic?)",1299831954

It would build brands both ways, as the article says. Of course, it's not needed at the high-end of BMW et. al., because they already have full-time staff for this stuff; but there's a huge middle-ground between that and the weight loss ads. Now, how to make it convenient and low-cost enough, to bring those benefits to the next tier, who are presently non-consumers of this service, but would love it (like lionhearted here)?<p>aside: low-cost in this article happen to also be unpleasant; but they needn't coincide. Most disruptions are low-cost (e.g. PCs). They are indeed low-quality, but only with respect to users who already have something better (e.g. mainframes). Google text ads are very low-cost, but also pretty good, especially when related to what you're searching for anyway - this is the idea they copied from (and paid off) overture.com (was: goto.com, now yahoo owns them). I think this was a fantastic idea, even better than google's search, because it aligns everyone's interest, even as it optimizes profit (the auction part).<p>Re: ""needing the money"": I recently negotiated my highest ever deal (by a significant integer factor). I did it by pretending I didn't need the money. But I really, really did, so this was... stressful. At the last, I gave in; but I estimate I could have gotten an extra $50,000 or so. Oh well, I still did really well. I prefer the article's plan of <i>not actually</i> needing the money. Fortunately, that deal is very close to putting me in that position.",1299831657

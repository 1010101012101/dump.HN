    because you will need to have an empty stomach for about 6-8 hours 
    before your procedure. This ensures that your stomach is empty of 
    any contents for general anesthesia. This way, if you get nauseated 
    after surgery, you can try to throw up, but nothing will come out. 
    With no stomach contents, you will not accidentally swallow stuff into 
    your windpipe, or lungs.

They guy's theories were the cause of the worst economic fiascos in the history of fiascos (in general, not just economic ones).<p>Consider this ""very salient point"": ""<i>if you limit the size of the government, you - by nature - limit the power a corporation can obtain. If the government has limited powers, so it goes that a corporation can gain limited powers - it should be impossible for a corporation to gain more power than a government</i>"".<p>This point is BS. There are places where corporations (or even one corporation) have more power than the government everywhere around the world, especially in Africa and Asia. There are entire countries where the government is just paid lackeys and a front for some mega-corporation. There is even a term for those, they are called ""banana republics"".<p>The limiting of the argument to ""one corporation"" is especially BS, since even if a single corporation cannot get ""bigger than the government"" in a place like the US, the ""corporate interests"" can and do get bigger than the government.<p>Despite fighting in the market (and that, only if they are serving the same market, which, say, Google, Exxon and GE do not), corporations also agree on a lot of things. For example media companies agree on SOPA and PIPA and a thousand other things (drm everywhere, destroy cinematographers unions, etc). And all corporate interest's also converge on a lot of things, like tax deductions, being able to fire any employee at will, lower minimum wages, unpaid overtime, etc.<p>Consider a country where there is no public health coverage. What will happen will not be ""competing health services for the benefit of the customer"" but an emergence of a health industry cartel and the total dependence of the people in it.

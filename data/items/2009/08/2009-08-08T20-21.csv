Not talking about deadlines and replies from the applicants.<p>I've checked google for 'decision making software' and found some applications, none of which are fully web-based and none of which provide outside world integration (i'm talking about generating web-forms and automated actions on each decision making step - for example sending email responses constructed out of templates).
To summ it up, what we need is: tools to receive the issues, a set of tools to host the discussion (not just stupid post/comment thing, we need it more like google wave), rules and conditions that trigger automated decisions and, finally, tools that talk to the outside world when decision has been made.<p>So, we are now thinking about implementing our own little software.

        Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.
        The default is “yes”.  Note that disabling TCP
        forwarding does not improve security unless users
        are also denied shell access, as they can always
        install their own forwarders.
</code></pre>
Basically this says, disabling TCP forwarding doesn't add any real security UNLESS your users don't have shell access.  This is not a throwaway statment because many SSH accounts do not have shell access.  For example, my Rsync.net backup account allows me to access it over ssh, but I can only run predetermined commands, that are deemed safe by the sysadmin (ls, cp, mv, etc, AND in a jail).  So in this case disabling it WOULD add security, since I don't have real shell access.
Also, it is quite easy to install a tcp forwarder as long as you have some access to any real language interpreter.<p>At my university, they throttled speeds for the residential network, so I compiled a simple java socks proxy and ran it on one of their servers that I had student access to, which allowed me to bypass the speed restriction.  Hell, if you wanted to, you could cook something up with bash and netcat.
To summarize, this is a great feature to have, and also one I use often.  At most, it should be disabled by default, but in most cases it won't matter since people who can use it usually have shells too.<p>And really, this is what sysadmins get paid to do!",1249763916

749766,comment,749615,749615,0,0,dbul,,,"Damn it feels good to be in Pittsburgh. As I often hop coffee shops, I understand the behavior. Students will even go so far as get a coffee, work, then go to a nearby food shop and bring something back for their dinner while they continue to work on their laptops. What's great is that no one cares. Here it is choice. Most coffee shops are open until 11 or midnight on the weeknights and 12 or 1 on the weekends, most have wifi, and most have outlets. If you were to be kicked out of one coffee shop, then simply that coffee shop loses your business and another one gains.<p>Just from observation, so many people come in and stay for just a few minutes or take their coffee to go that it's kind of a nice equilibrium. It's rare that you'll find a coffee shop in Pittsburgh to 100% capacity (except perhaps Sunday afternoon or evening in the fall and spring). Electricity costs nothing. If anything, having people in your coffee shop serves as a kind of advertisement that it is a place people want to be for whatever reason -- the coffee is good or they just feel comfortable there.<p>As fantastic as Manhattan is, there are two reasons why I wouldn't want to live there: too many tourists and too few coffee shops. The best I could find in the upper west side was Cosi, a chain. The best I could find around Soho was some piece that closed earlier than shops in Pittsburgh.

All my experience with small businesses (2 just in my immediate family, friends with lots more) is that dealing with the administrative as well as straight up monetary demands of taxes actively prevents them from hiring as many people as they'd like to.  it seems like common sense that if you wanted to encourage employment you'd have like a 3 month moratorium on new payroll taxes when getting new employees up and productive.
considering that you're taking someone OFF unemployment and turning them into an active taxpayer...seems like a completely unadulterated win-win for the government...so why is there zero incentive?",1249762720

From what I understand, inferno is not designed do be addictive per se, it's designed do be hard and it's aimed at people who want to play hard games.<p>I believe (but have no good citations / evidence for) that there's another system in the brain for rewarding behavior, one that is based on the satisfaction of accomplishing tasks that are difficult.  This other loop may be a little harder to study, I'd imagine that it would be difficult to get most animals to exhibit this loop.<p>Just take a look at a sample of walkthroughs for various games, alongside traditional guides you'll find esoteric ones: guides marked as ""low-level"", ""solo"", ""pacifist"", ""naked"", etc.  There are also play styles such as ""ironman"".  Back in the day, I used to play Diablo ironman with friends.  You're not allowed to talk to merchants in town.  I played FF6 ""low-level"", where you don't allow the characters to gain levels: run from any fight you can, but you still have to fight the bosses with a woefully underpowered team.<p>It's tapping into the same reward systems that reward programmers for refactoring code.<p>So I guess my final point is that you can't call something less addictive by analyzing it, since you can only analyze the addiction mechanisms you know about.

Those ones aren't pretty. But we kind of need them, because they set the precedents that all the other disputes are resolved under. For example, it will be a lot harder to claim that APIs are protected by copyright now, and that will have an impact on all kinds of disputes that never reach a courtroom.<p>I mean, I pretty much agree with you -- it's totally true that lawsuits are miserable things to be part of, and are often hard to salvage any value from for the parties. Do what you can to avoid them -- work with people you trust, write your contracts explicitly and carefully so everyone's on the same page and everything's in writing, and do your best to settle disputes through mediation, where you can make the pie bigger instead of watching lawyers fight over their slice. But also remember that what those lawyers and judges and juries are doing in the disaster cases is <i>negotiating the boundaries of the society we want to live in</i>. In this case, the boundaries were improved by the process. So it might not be such a bad thing -- other than for Oracle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit</a>",1338914560

I've spent much of my adulthood learning social skills I never picked up as a child or teenager and they in themselves have an incredible amount of power. Without the socialites we wouldn't have gotten on the moon because we'd be too busy in our basements making toothpick replicas of various Lord of The Ring battles. Honestly, NASA is a pretty poor example. The amount of politicking, career maneuvering, inter department competition, giant egos, public policy changes, new administrations, etc going on there would be unbearable to someone like Grandin.<p>Different evolutionary neurotypical strategies exist because they have value. One isn't ""better"" than another. Let's stop playing this game and accept that from a macro view there's a lot going on and its unfair to piss on or put one group on a pedestal. Its just too easy to do so. Ease and psychologically pleasing conclusions should always be seen with a critical eye.<p>I think this is also why extremist right-wing politics appeals to the geeky crowd. We like simple answers that rely on systems (free markets, no taxes) and don't understand how the social aspects (regulation, control, subsidizing for the poor) matter. To many they're just roadblocks to some idealized system that 'must work' because it makes sense on paper in a very simple way.<p>Oh well, here come the downvotes, but I really wish on a personal level that my own issues were addressed when I was younger. I learned long ago that, yes, I'm smart and creative and am able to do difficult things, but the price for that for a long time was misery, loneliness, confusion, and depression.

That's great!<p>Every time a Facebook usage topic comes up there's the usual round of scorn usually backed up by a strange display of plumage involving the sentence, ""I just deleted my facebook yesterday/last month/last year/never used it.""<p>And that's <i>okay.</i> But I want to point out to my fellow HN-goers why facebook is so wonderful. There's also a note about privacy at the bottom[1] since that seems to be a big reason people stay away. I feel as if a lot of people here missed the point and doesn't understand what the average person sees in this system. I'll try to relay my experience in the hopes that you see the utility.<p>To most people, especially a shy person, the usefulness of the site is <i>astronomical.</i><p>Among others I am friends with my boss, my mother, my little cousins. Facebook lets shy people like me keep in touch with a massive amount of people where I can write them the modern equivalent of letters very quickly and easily, as well as let them broadcast their life's updates to me. I can keep in touch with all manner of people. I love writing letters, people love getting letters. Facebook is not far off.<p>Without facebook, I'd have no idea cousin X is having a baby, or that Y is having apartment trouble that I can help them with, or that Z got a new game we can play together, or person A is considering selling their car, and so on.<p>If I meet someone at an event and really hit it off (romantically or not), I can go on facebook the next day and look them up by name and add them. No exchanging phone numbers or emails or anything like that. I just search for them and find them. In college it was enormously useful for making friends and I still find it useful now that I've graduated.<p>I made a page for my hometown (90K population city in NH). I broadcast events going on around the city (fireworks, beer festival, city meetings). In this way I help my community learn about the goings-on of the town. It's a surprisingly popular page (more popular than the local newspaper's facebook page).<p>These functions in times past were done with the laborous process of making a million letters or phone calls or in many cases (like my hometown page) scarcely made or not made at all.<p>Literally, facebook is a modern ""An open letter to my friends"" system. And it's great at it.<p>~~~~~~<p>Okay that's off my chest.<p>Sadly as of late its getting a little less great at its function. A lot of the reason for the downturn in usage, sadly, is probably due to the fact that every ad, every sponsored story and sponsored ""like"" is adding to a signal/noise ratio that will make people frown. It's a shame that facebook's financial success as the model is right now is directly competing with its utility[2], but oh-well. We may have to sigh a bit more, but its still extremely useful to the casual user and has the usage stats to show it.<p>[1] I don't think privacy alone is enough to negate the utility of fbook. All of my privacy options are on the lowest possible setting. I treat anything that occurs on the site as if it were public. I don't see why not, I'm not going to pretend that photos of myself or my wall postings are anywhere near interesting enough to hide. In fact I'm not sure why people who put things on facebook want privacy at all. I never worry that something I say might be picked up on by the wrong person because I'd never say anything that I wouldn't want the world to hear.<p>[2] It may be worth pointing out that I love facebook but would never invest in it for a few reasons, and this is one of them. One could argue Google ads make Google searches more useful. Facebook ads, as they are today, <i>directly</i> impinge on the utility of the platform. But thats a separate topic",1338913689

Well, I didn't actually play D2 that much because I didn't find it fun -- and perhaps this article explains why. But for the people who want D3 to have the same addictive feel of D2, I speculate that part of it has to do with being able to commit a lot of time to get those rare spikes of joy upon getting a fantastic drop. All the serious D2 gamers knew all of the best items and finding them was a big part of the game for them (or perhaps it WAS the game?)<p>For me, I'd rather have a game where the combat is fun, and that's where I think D3 is a huge improvement upon D2. Blizzard's own stats show that people are playing with a wide variety of skills. That's a lot different than D2, where many skills were useless, there were only a handful of worthwhile builds, and everybody lusted after the same items.<p>At first I didn't understand why a randomly generated magic item could be better than a ""legendary"" item, but now it makes sense. If a person gets a legendary item, they know they've gotten something that will be good for most players, but it won't be the best. As such, people still have the ability to grow and get better items instead of thinking, ""Well, I've gotten Sword of Awesome, no need to do anything more."" To me, that makes the game more interesting, and it enhances replayability for when I sign on and play with friends. I guess things might be different for people who only play alone, though.<p>I'm sure the Auction House plays a big role in all of this, and many want to ascribe ""evil"" motives to Blizzard. Certainly the item economy will take time for them to fully understand. But even if there wasn't an AH, I think that the way they went with items (and the way skills play off of them) was the right choice for creating a game that is consistently fun.

4069287,comment,4068807,4068807,9,0,robomartin,,,"I learned APL in college and used it professionally for about eight years.  I really enjoyed the language.  Once you know it well enough it creates a very interesting flow condition. You are able to focus on the problem rather than the mechanics of solving it.  It's hard to describe but you definitely feel the difference when going from APL to something like C, Forth or Lisp.<p>One of the huge problems with APL back then was that workspaces (the memory and resource sandbox your work is constrained to) were limited in size.  The other was the trouble you had to go through in the early days to be able to see and print the character set.  On early IBM PC versions you had to change the character generator ROM.  You also had to buy very specific printers for which you could buy APL print heads (for example, IBM Selectric).<p>Today these issues are gone and workspaces are large enough to tackle the vast majority of problems.<p>There is, however, in my opinion, a serious problem with APL today:  It is too expensive.<p>Yes, there are low cost or even free APL's, but the ones you want will run you $1,000 to $2,000 per seat.  That's ridiculous.  If there's a language that would have benefited from FOSS, this is it.  I strongly believe that APL adoption would be far wider today if it had a strong FOSS offering.<p>The other issue is that, probably because it didn't go FOSS, the language didn't evolve into OO.  I think it needs to.  It also needs a few additional mutations to make it easier to work with and deploy.  APL for the web, as a wild thought, could be a very interesting idea.  The compression of code would be magnificent to see.<p>I haven't used APL in quite some time but would jump on it if it made sense.  Back in the day I used APL for projects ranging from robotics, to business databases, DNA sequencing and astronomical calculations.  It was fun.",1338913340

Cell phones are in continuous contact with authorities and come with video and audio. But kids actually <i>want</i> to carry cell phones. Having a cell phone gives you capabilities. Wearing a single-purpose electronic leash that's attached to your mom just leads to embarrassment.<p>Could one market this to the parents of kids too young for cell phones? What kid is that, exactly? Infants don't roam very far, and any kid older than three can use a cell phone. That cell phone will almost certainly be cheaper than this device, and the kid that can be trusted not to break, lose, or perpetually forget to carry this device can probably also be trusted with that cheap cell phone.",1257904783

Clients have tried to get us to sign all manner of ridiculous NDAs, and are constantly trying to buffalo us with threats of taking their business elsewhere, but I've yet to lose a sale because of refusing to sign an NDA.<p>We've been successful here though because we're very clear about what we are willing to sign NDAs about, and why. I will not sign an NDA to hear your cool idea because that could limit my opportunities going forward, but I will sign one that says I won't disclose your client roster or sensitive client data to an outsider.<p><i>VC's (for instance) won't sign NDAs because they don't want to be sued by spurned startups over something they ""never"" do (stealing ideas from pitches --- note: this is something several of them do). VC's get to not sign NDAs, because no VC will sign them, and they have all the money.</i><p>There's another facet at work here too: VCs won't sign an NDA to hear your pitch because you're providing absolutely no value to them, in exchange for something of great value (their ability to fund similar projects later). That's exactly the reason I won't sign an NDA just to have a meeting either.<p>Your point about the VC having all the leverage holds here as well. We like to say the VC is ""the hot chick"" in the situation. I think you'd find that in the design/development business there's a lot more ""hot chicks"" than you might think.<p>My advice is simple: get your lawyer to draft a generic NDA that you are comfortable signing, and offer that instead.

With the awful response from Reddit [1], I'm not sure that I want to make another go at it. :) We'll see.<p>To respond to your example, I'd almost certainly go with something like your Count_Xs_in_Row path, or some similar subset of the problem. I'd probably first drive out the ""win"" concept by saying ""if there's a row full of Xs, X wins; if a row full of Os, O wins."" I don't actually need to be able to count rows for that; I can pass something fake in (probably a stub). Once I'd done that, I'd drive out the row counting, possibly backporting that into the ""win"" tests, but probably leaving them totally isolated.<p>In this example, the key insight is that the concept of winning (a full row) can be independent of the process of counting rows. The tests would push you toward that separation naturally, because it would be too hard to think about testing the ""X wins"" directly based upon a full board.<p>This is still a bit overwrought, as it's still a toy example. Toy examples make TDD sound silly, which is a big part of its perception problem.

That is, Y(f) = f' such that f(f') = f', where f and f' are both higher-order functions. Of course, I doubt there're many people familiar with higher-order functions and fixed points that don't already know functional programming.<p>On the other hand, it's relatively easy to get a feel for what Y does if you try manually evaluating it in the lambda calculus. This is easy, since evaluating lambda calculus by hand is little more than repeated string substitution, but it's not really a ""one liner"".<p>From a ""practical"" standpoint of doing anonymous recursion, the way it works can be described as ""Evaluating Y on an ersatz recursive function f evaluates f itself, but passes in Y(f) as an argument that f can evaluate in turn."" Leaves Y as a black box, but makes it clearer how it creates recursive functions.<p>Honestly, trying to explain Y to someone new to functional programming is probably pointless.

I wouldn't really know where to start asking questions, but here are a few:<p>What sets the field apart from other areas of programming, in terms of your problem-solving approach? What kind of special qualifications do recruiters look for?<p>Also, what kind of platform (OS, language, etc.) do you use? Do you hand-optimize the code?",1257901445
934355,comment,934142,934339,0,0,omnigoat,,,"Well, in the interests of actually furthering discussion:<p>I feel as if string and map simply could have been part of the standard library. My solution to the this for prism was to have a section of the standard library (which doesn't exist yet) marked as ""integral"", to effectively have an implicit ""import string, map from std.__integral__"" at the top of every translation unit.<p>The absence of overloading operators seems to contradict their claims of improving the visual ""flow"" and feel of programming. There are cases where savvy operator overloading works wonders: vectors/matrices/quaternions, strings, complex numbers, etc. To be able to write my_string + my_other_string is far more elegant than strcat(my_string, my_otherstring). Consider what happens when you have four of five strings you'd like to concatenate!<p>The choice of CSP reflects Google's mentality: Their problems lend themselves very well to CSP. Other domains (in my opinion) work better with a STM model. But that's clearly a design choice, and I think it's fine!",1257901273

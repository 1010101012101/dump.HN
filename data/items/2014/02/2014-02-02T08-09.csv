There <i>is</i> a recognized right to travel as implicit, not in the Bill of Rights, but in the structure of the Constitution.  The idea is that we are all citizens of the United States and we have a right to travel about the United States.  See Crandall v. Nevada.<p>That poses some very interesting questions.  If there is no right to a specific mode of travel, but some places can only be reached effectively by plane (say Hawaii) then does placing an American on a no-fly list impact that right to go to Hawaii?  Does it matter if that individual is a resident of Hawaii and is thus effectively barred from interstate travel by this?<p>Internationally things get more complicated.  I am not aware of any cases which hold squarely a right for Americans to travel about the world as they please.  Certainly bans on spending money travelling to Cuba have been upheld.  However what the government clearly cannot do is to take a protected criteria like speech, religion, or political viewpoint and use that as a basis for travel.<p>If an individual were to say that policy was to dissuade Muslims from travelling, the harm would be that Muslims would get together and sue the government in order to determine the scope of this misbehavior and put a stop to it.  There really isn&#x27;t that much harm when compared to the likely other uses of such a power (silencing discussions, for example, of what Islam means for politics in the US).  On the whole disadvantaged groups are protected by bans on hate speech, given what the government has done in the past.",1391331589

7165384,comment,7156863,7161509,1,0,dclara,,,"I got your point, very constructive. Here is my thought:<p>1. Bridge between the RF module and the internet\nIf all the processing is done on the host pc side, leave the device only having the sensor to detect the state and \nbeing driven by the host pc, then it will be a lot easier to build the device itself, don&#x27;t need that much functionalities. This should be the direction.<p>2. Transmission mechanism should not be a problem except the worrying about the wifi cost since it has all the necessary functionality built in with encode/decode, security and compression/decompression which becomes a heavy burden on the device side. But it should be easy to resolve by embedding a Linux kernel with the wifi stack.<p>3. SDR might be a solution to deal with various RF protocols, but do you think the performance will be compromised than using the hardware components?<p>So all of the available or to be defined protocols and mechanisms can be tested out if the platform supports simple/thin devices. Your proposed embedding wifi module is a very good solution to meet this requirement. Do these products have FPGA or SoC with UART or SPI interface?<p>If you are interested in further discussion, maybe we can take it offline.

7165371,comment,7158786,7160952,1,0,einhverfr,,,"First of all, the limits of rights occurs in any culture in a cultural and historical context.  Slopes can be more slippery in some places than others.  In the US, you have tremendous emphasis on free speech not because free speech is necessarily good but because the restrictions on the government address past excesses in governmental action.  So the historical context is important here.<p>A century ago, you would probably have been right.  This speech has some significant bad tendencies that the government has a legitimate interest in regulating.  If the government had been responsible in using that power, that might be the test today.<p>Unfortunately the trouble started in WWI, when sedition prosecutions were brought against individuals for encouraging people not to report for the draft.  While the prosecutions were ultimately upheld, they made members of the court nervous.  As a result the court, in Schenk v. United States, tightened up the standard a bit, to &quot;clear and present danger&quot; and including the famous bit about shouting fire in a crowded theater and laughing as people are trampled.<p>I think your hypothetical would be harder to justify under this new standard (in 1917) because it isn&#x27;t clear that the danger is either clear or present.  However, given prosecutions of alleged Communists in the 1920&#x27;s I think it would stick.<p>The prosecutions of alleged communism, and the political antics surrounding them (HUAC, etc), eventually lead the courts to conclude that the basis of American democracy required a free marketplace of ideas.  This eventually lead to the standard becoming a lot more tight in Yates v. United States (holding that urging people to accept the moral necessity of eventual violent overthrow of the government was protected speech, and not the equivalent of raising an army to accomplish such an end).  In essence saying that workers must at some point unite and overthrow the government did not pose a clear or present danger but rather an unclear, future danger.<p>The danger in this context is not that a sincere opinion will be restrained but that the government will use its force to create apparent consensus for its preferred policies, and therefore deny the people a real voice in the matter.  This is a structural, functional problem, and perhaps a less centralized, more local, more responsible and inclusive government might not have somewhere else.",1391331096

There&#x27;s no way to expect that to ever be &quot;reasonable&quot; for a mobile game. I could go with up to about $20 in IAP. For instance the Settlers of Catan iPad game is rather expensive at $9 up front with expansions at $2 - $3 each that match the paper version of expansions and you can easily sink $20 in to get all the pieces, but you don&#x27;t NEED all the pieces to play the same game that&#x27;s in the paper version box. Many other games do a very fine job of using it to unlock new &quot;expansions&quot; as they add extra additional effort to the game every few months.

It is such a great intuitive and <i>false</i> truth, that when George Akerlof informed us about this about 50 years ago he got an Nobel price for his effort.<p>&quot;The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism&quot; inform us how the bad drives out the good when there is an information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. It uses the market for used cars as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty, but software (games) is several order worse in this aspect. Even a game software developer can not assess the value of a product through examination before purchase, so the only hint available to customers are reviews (such as those provided in this HN linked article). Sadly, reviews are not enough to reverse the information asymmetry, as proven by the article point, so the lemon games are driving out the good games from the market.<p>However, contrary to the article I do think we can escape. Strong reputation systems can combat it if used correctly, but for-profit gatekeepers like Nintendo, Steam, and Apple has shown to be affected by short-term thinking and corruption. Thus, we need better reputation systems that the customer can trust long-term for the lemon market to reverse.

Hardware typically gets a year free, and it also costs a whole lot more than software.<p>You didn&#x27;t pay for any sort of extended warranty. Legally the only warranty required is that at time of purchase it work as advertised. It did, and while Adobe has an additional warranty they&#x27;ve added, it doesn&#x27;t say you get everything you wish for just because you want it.<p>Even saying you purchased the full creative suite at $2600, that&#x27;s $650/year, $54.17/month. You didn&#x27;t pay all that much for it, slightly less than $2 a day. Even assuming you purchased it near the end of it&#x27;s life, that&#x27;s 3 years, making it $72.23/month, which is only $2.37/day. That&#x27;s less than the price of a meal.<p>Additionally, they have no responsibility to provide you with an installer. You got your installer, based on the post the author still had the installer, but happened to purchase a computer without a disk drive, which is essentially purchasing a computer without the minimum system requirements of the installer. The author could purchase a disk drive, or borrow a disk drive, or use his old computer&#x27;s disk drive across the network (something OS X has the capability to do built in).<p>Adobe also never had to provide downloads of those installers in the first place. Just because they previously had them available to download doesn&#x27;t mean they have a responsibility to continue keeping them available for download. Your losing your disks is your fault, not Adobe&#x27;s.<p>So, bullshit yourself.",1391329548

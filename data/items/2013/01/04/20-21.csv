Many would disagree with you there.<p>Do you mean that ""pirate"" coders have been able to circumvent all existing DRM techniques, so consumers can always get DRM-free movies if they seek them out? That may be true, but it's a continuing arms race with the movie industry, so it's not an ideal solution.",1357333174

5009850,comment,5009001,5009001,14,0,davidw,,,"I have a rant coming about these things too.<p>* I started out with Backbone.  It seems ok as far as it goes, but a bit annoying in that there's enough ""magic"" and stuff going on that I don't quite understand it completely, but without enough magic to really make things simple and easy.<p>* Angular.js.  Now this is more like it in terms of magic.  Then, the other day, I decided to add a date picker to one of my forms.  Uh oh: <a href=""http://www.grobmeier.de/angular-js-binding-to-jquery-ui-datepicker-example-07092012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grobmeier.de/angular-js-binding-to-jquery-ui-date...</a> - how many lines of code just to make it a date picker?  I couldn't have written that code myself without several more days of banging my head.  Wonder what'd happen if I really try and do something it doesn't agree with...  So out the window with that for the time being.<p>Also: a lot of these tools have tutorials that don't really walk me through all of what I want to do, which initially involves a fairly straightforward ""CRUD"" type of application.  I want to see how the framework deals with both 'make me a new one' and 'edit an existing one' forms, for instance.  I found that very irritating about the Angular tutorial, which is otherwise <i>very</i> nicely put together.<p>Now I'm testing out jquery-pjax, and... so far I'm happier.  It behaves more like a web application that I'm used to, sending around HTML, and staying out of my way.  And, seeing as how all of these things require that the server do its job in any case, it has more of a  ""don't repeat yourself"" feel to it: click on the button, and the server gives us some new data, without repeating the whole MVC cycle on both the client and server.  I got the idea from this post: <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to-be-so-damn-fast-without-using-much-client-side-ui"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3112-how-basecamp-next-got-to...</a>",1357333146
5009849,comment,5009271,5009528,3,0,dkarl,,,"As a user, scanning a 2D array of tiles feels like work.  I think this might be part of the reason:  if I don't remember how a particular app or page is laid out, I have to scan both ways and decide which way makes more sense.<p>Maybe a single convention could emerge per mobile platform, but across the entire web, I doubt it, and honestly, my biggest problem with 2D grids is that scanning every item systematically feel very unnatural, and I doubt I will ever break that habit.  Decades of reading has led me to see me to see Roman text as coherent, directed strings, and lists also naturally elicit in-order scanning behavior for me, but 2D grids of squares or rectangles are used for things that require different scanning behavior.  When I look at maps, board games, and color or fabric samples, for example, I tend to hop around looking for patterns among groups of tiles, combined with occasional breadth-first scanning outward from points.  My first reaction to a 2D grid is never to systematically scan all individual items but to start jumping around impressionistically, and then to switch to a systematic scan if the impressionistic method fails.  Naturally, switching provokes irritation, both at myself and at the situation.<p>I wonder if the experience is different for people who grew up reading Chinese.",1357333122

The USB interface would act like a disk, holding an executable or two you'd like.<p>Walk over the process list in memory, and find one that's got good privileges but stays asleep.  Patch its code to call mount (anywhere's fine, maybe in the heap, or if it's asleep in sys_read, in the destination buffer), alter the saved IP in the task table to the mount call, and (this may be the tricky part) move it to a CPU's ready-task list.<p>After mount, play the same trick to run an executable, and change it's UID to root.  Hell it can just spin in a get UID/sleep() loop until it's ready.  Then you've got all of root-userland to do what you need.

There is a conservation of complexity that you just can't get rid of in an application.

Sure a poor programmer can drive up the complexity with unnecessary constructs, but the converse is not true: a great programmer can drive to simplicity.  For example, a flight control system for a 777 can never be reduced to a single file of 700 lines of code.  It will likely always be 2000+ files, and have lots of inter-dependencies.<p>So I guess (run time safety issues of Scala aside) Scala is not an appropriate language for complex problems by your own words?",1357333031

And then Intel turned around and has been trying to get all of the 'other' manufacturers to make MBA clones aka Ultrabooks.<p>If Apple says, ""Make us a Haswell chip where there is an extra GPU core, but don't let anyone but us use that core."" That is a hard place to be for Intel. Now they invest time and energy in a silicon change, and an all mask change at that (not just a metal layer change) with the proviso that only Apple can use those extra transistors. The only way to amortize that cost is on Apple sales, and if Apple says ""Gee, that hasn't been as successful as we'd like, never mind."" Intel takes a hit.<p>When I was at Sun, Sun decided to start making its own CPUs (the SPARC architecture). Seeing how they could tune their code and their process to the CPU gave them similar advantages that DEC, HP, and IBM had who all had an in house CPU capability. Previously Motorola was the chip maker but Motorola wouldn't agree to 'Sun specific' changes, especially if it forces Motorola to support a specialized part just for Sun. Early on Apple tried a different approach which was a consortium which had a CPU architecture (PowerPC) that could make chips just for it. That must have shown them the advantages of that approach but dissuaded them from wanting to convince 'somebody else' when they wanted something done their way.<p>FWIW, I also think the fact that Samsung had that capability (making their own ARM chips) and they were executing faster than Apple was really pushed Apple into the space it is today.<p>What that adds up to is Intel being frozen out of the market. Can't compete on price, can't compete on features, and can't compete on software base (any more). Bad news all around. Will be interesting to see if Intel decides they are going to start making smartphones/tablets themselves.",1357332461

Both internalize cost to the production of pollution. In a tax, the cost is fixed and the total amount of pollution is market-determined. With a cap it is the reverse. However, at the point where the prices agree, they are, in principle, equivalent.<p>> Trading schemes add a lot of unnecessary complexity and potential for abuse, and enshrine the idea that if you have polluted more in the past, you deserve to keep polluting more in the future.<p>Allocating pollution licenses to past polluters is only one possible way of distributing them. A cap-and-trade system could also to hold yearly auctions for each year's permits. The former is used many times in part because incumbents are less likely to oppose regulation. They may even be able to achieve efficiencies and sell their allocated permits at a profit because of cap-and-trade. But note that even though the incumbents are receiving the permits for free, they still have an incentive to reduce pollution when the cost of the efficiency is less than the cost of the permit.<p>> Instead just quantify the total harm caused by emissions the best you can, divide by total emissions amounts, and levy that as a tax per pound of emission.<p>Two problems is that the harm may be difficult to quantify in a price and more importantly the harm may not be linear in the amount of pollution. You could argue that the optimal solution would be for the government to estimate the harm as a function of the amount of pollution and hold some sort of complicated auction where the price depended on the quantity of pollution permits sold.

It's been full of end users for years now and most of them are easily fooled by stuff like this. CyanogenMod <i>is</i> developed in the open and they do have quite a few contributors, but it's not terribly ground breaking (although some of their features do get reimplemented in AOSP eventually). The fact is that the Android project is really a gigantic codebase and it takes a lot of time to get started (and even on a really fast machine, 20-40 minutes to build), and a lot of the work CyanogenMod developers do is porting to hardware that's unsupported by AOSP, not feature development.",1357331934

Humans tend to be pretty good at accepting things that are mostly random, or mostly skill-based, but have a surprisingly hard time with things that involve a combination of skill and luck. For a great example of this, watch amateur poker players.<p>This is just as true in investing-people tend to espouse either ""all skill"" (e.g. Warren Buffett"") or ""all luck"" (one common interpretation of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.) Even defining skill in investing is difficult. High-risk investments tend to have a high return, so skill is getting an outsized return compared to the amount of risk involved. But the simple measures of risk (e.g. Beta) are not good <i>actual</i> measure of risk. For example, a company whose stock price suddenly plummeted is often a good investment since the market tends to overreact to bad news. Furthermore, the stock is now lower-risk because it has less to lose. But it will appear extremely high risk by most common measures.<p>I think it's a decent assumption in VC to treat all investments at stage X as equally risky. E.g. angel investments are one category, series A as another. This is obviously not 100% perfect but is a decent approximation.<p>Then we can ask the following question: how did Sequoia Capital's series A investments in a certain time period (say 2000-2005) perform compared to all other series A investments? It's important that you look at all of a VC's investments and not just a particular fund, because firms will often bury their bad funds.<p>I have no idea if that kind of data is available anywhere, though.",1357331255

Its very hard to tailor the reading experience to be anything better than mediocre -- and at times on short, wide screens, its downright awful. Windows 8 makes a mess of things by scrolling sideways in landscape mode, then up and down in portrait mode.  Readability is sacrificed at the alter of adaptable design.  The tiles lead the eyes no where -- because content can really go in any direction (up down left right? why not down through 3D or even up or spinning maybe too?  They are all done in Windows 8)<p>The other thing tiles do poorly is constrain the variances on line lengths by boxing them in.  When you scan headlines, you naturally grip the page using the various headline lengths.

I've had a lacrosse coach go through every player on a team and publicly tell them what they do poorly.  I'm not saying that is the best coaching style, but it gets you used to handling criticism and responding to it.\n-An ability to face failure.  At one point or another everyone fails at sports.  Usually it happens a lot.  Being able to respond and grow from those failures can be really important, especially at a startup.\n-Competitiveness.  Obviously by competing a lot athlete will have a desire to win.  In addition, I've found they have a ""do anything to win"" attitude that can be great at a startup when you need people to fill in rolls that may not be glamorous or cool but are integral to success<p></i>these attribues aren't only found in athletes, but I have found them more often with athletes more than the general populous",1357331222

Personally, I would stop paying them (and probably switch to another insurance company), and I suspect a vast majority of their customers would do the same thing, and probably long before it got to the point where it ""became the government.""<p>The only ways for a private insurance company in a free society to remain dominant while consistently not honoring their agreements would be if society as a whole didn't care about the agreements being honored (which seems unlikely), if they gather enough power to <i>physically</i> oppress an entire region (which also seems unlikely these days, since very few <i>governments</i> are even able or willing to pull that off), or if they convince society that they should be allowed to have a monopoly on violence.

I am not going to draw the demarcation line myself, the subject is too complex and each discipline has it's own boundaries.<p>That said, if you have ever invested any time in the process of patent search I would be surprised if you did not share my sentiment: the vast majority of patents I have seen should never have been issued.<p>I fully expect lawyer types to say something akin to: ""You have to read the claims carefully.  The differences can be subtle but important"".  I've heard this before.  My answer has always been the same: As an engineer I don't have to dive into intricate lawyer-ese to know bullshit when I see it.  A spring attached to a motor to control force, you know, ""F=kx"", is way beyond obvious to anyone who took first-semester Physics.  Yet, you lawyers manage to craft convoluted language that takes ""F=kx"" in the form of a motor and a spring and turns it into a patent that I now have to worry about if I do robotics (which I have done in the past).<p>Perhaps one of the problems is that the USPTO (I can't speak for other countries) is like a self-feeding fire: The more patents they approve the more people and companies have to file protection patents, which brings in more and more money to support more and more bureaucrats. Every patent you approve is a patent that has ""job security"" written all over it.  If, starting on Monday, they approved patents at a rate of 10% of what they did last year they would probably have to fire 75% of their staff (just guessing).<p>Maybe the way to fight nonsense patents isn't to make an intellectual claim at all.  Maybe the only way is to act politically in order to funnel, say, 50% of USPTO revenue to the Department of Health, or Education or completely outside of government entities.  The USPTO would cease to be a self-feeding fire and they might just be forced to only pass real patents.<p>What if there was a rule that everyone involved in a patent that is invalidated is fired and they loose their pension?  Violent, yes, but it would sure raise the bar very, very quickly to a super-high level.  Which is exactly where the bar should be.<p>The other aspect of this is that perhaps patents should cost a lot more money and be subject to a significantly more public process where prior art is defined far more liberally than it is today.  If a patent application costs started at the lesser of a million dollars or some percentage of last year's revenue the bullshit patents would go away.  In the case of organizations like Google/Apple/Samsung it might cost them ten million dollars to apply for one patent and dozens of millions of dollars to actually get one patent.  If a patent costs fifty million dollars I suspect we are not going to see many ""slide the button this way"" patents filed.  Yes, this is off-the-hip and not well thought out.  I get it.  Take it as more of a random though out of frustration than a coherent idea.<p>Sometimes you just want to cry when you learn about some of the consequences of the government-sponsored monopolies created through the USPTO.  Here's a particularly touching example:<p><a href=""http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/06/14/speech.application.removed.by.apple.pending.outcome.of.hearings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/06/14/speech.applica...</a><p>The teachers at my kid's school asked me if would collaborate with them to help create (free) iPad apps for their developmentally-challenged students.  Of course, I will, but the above bullshit patent and the many more that must exist in the dark files at the USPTO sometimes jar your reality. It is a sad note that rather than sit down and start writing code one of the first things I have to do is a patent search.<p>Sometimes I wish things were like when I was younger and more innocent: I could choose to help someone with my knowledge of technology and we'd all benefit from what might result (commercial or not).  That, sometimes, is a tough choice to make today.",1357330099

You can access the product while the ""secret sauce"" remains safely tucked away in a data center.<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum think of a company like Intel investing into WiMAX. Developing that standard was not cheap, but almost by definition it was something that required disclosure of the end result. Intel can try to recoup the initial investment by selling chips implementing the standard, but competitors can always undercut them on price because they didn't have to spend any money coming up with the initial design.<p>There is a lot of technology that's much easier to reverse engineer than it is to develop. Especially with software, where it's often very easy to dig out a copy of the firmware from a competing product and decompile it.<p>You might think this kind of stuff doesn't actually happen, but in the 1990's American companies hated working with the Chinese precisely for this reason.

You&#x27;ve probably seen e.g. the memcmp that doesn&#x27;t exit early.  This attack is a little different in that it&#x27;s not that different instructions are executed, it&#x27;s that different memory access patterns take different amounts of time.  For that, you can maybe change the implementation to not have any data-dependent array accesses, or maybe you can do things with prefetching to make the memory accesses constant time.<p>An approach where you watch the clock will be inherently less portable and actually much harder.  Not only will the timing calls be hardware or OS specific, but so will the worst-case time.  Imagine having to deal with a chip going into low power mode during your computation.  Also you probably don&#x27;t want to count time that your thread wasn&#x27;t scheduled to run, so now you&#x27;re talking about integrating with the scheduler.",1415897478

Additionally, if the government treats foreigners as if they were protected by Privacy Act it might also reduce the number of ways in which the government could compel production of evidence on those foreigners, especially data held by U.S. companies.<p>Privacy Act was never meant to prevent the collection of evidence for investigations, or to prevent legally-obtained evidence from being used in legal or administrative proceedings, but those are not the only protections Privacy Act gives, so applying it to aliens could well be a net gain.

There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;unenforceable&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot;. There&#x27;s nothing to prevent Amazon from including such a clause in the contract, even if it is clearly unenforceable. The worst case scenario, from Amazon&#x27;s perspective, is that a court simply rules that the clause is unenforceable (as happened in the example masklinn gave <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8600939"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8600939</a> ).<p>The best case scenario is that Amazon can frighten an ex-employee with the threat of legal action if he accepts a job with a competitor. Even if the ex-employee knows that a court will likely rule the clause is unenforceable, he has to decide whether he wants to go to the hassle and expense of fighting Amazon in court.<p>Amazon could also use the clause as a pretext to dissuade potential employers from hiring the ex-employee. Again, while the potential employer might realise that the clause is unenforceable, they have to decide whether they want to take the risk of hiring someone who will then be sued by Amazon (while it may not affect the potential employer directly, the new employee will inevitably be distracted by the court case).<p>I would never recommend that anyone sign an employment contract with a non-compete clause, even if it&#x27;s clearly unenforceable. Even setting aside the potential legal hassle if it goes to court, you want to think about <i>why</i> they&#x27;ve included such a clause in the contract. Either they don&#x27;t realise that it&#x27;s unenforceable (in which case you have to question how competent they are), or they know it&#x27;s unenforceable but don&#x27;t care (which suggests that they plan to use it to frighten/bully you, as described above).<p>Recently, I turned down a job because the company included a clause in the employment contract under which I would have been prevented from engaging in &quot;any activity&quot; that competed with the company (or its related companies), anywhere in the world, for two years after I left the company. In the relevant legal jurisdiction (Switzerland), non-compete clauses are legal but &quot;must be appropriately restricted with regard to place, time and scope such that it does not unfairly compromise the employee’s future economic activity&quot;. This one clearly wasn&#x27;t. Effectively, it would have prevented me from working in banking or fintech, which is pretty much all that I&#x27;ve done for the last 14 years. I consulted an employment lawyer, who confirmed that it would definitely be thrown out if it ever went to court, so I pushed back.<p>I have zero problem with clauses that prohibit me from poaching clients or hiring other employees but if a company&#x27;s hiring me for my expertise and experience that I&#x27;ve gained before going to work for them, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable for them to try to prevent me from using that same expertise and experience at another company if I leave them.<p>In the end, they refused to remove or alter the clause, so I turned down the job.",1415895196

Why, of course not &quot;git diff --index&quot; but &quot;git diff --cached&quot;.<p>(In what way the index acts as a cache is beyond me; a cache is a fast place where you look for something that is also available in some slower place, but things in the index are sometimes only in the index and nowhere else!)<p>Furthermore, things in the index are not &quot;indexed&quot; or &quot;cached&quot;. Why, they are &quot;staged&quot;. So why don&#x27;t they call it the stage?

If you do a &quot;git diff&quot;, you see the difference between the index and your working copy for any changed file. But if the index doesn&#x27;t have that file, then it gets out of the way and you see the diff between HEAD and the working copy.

Sometimes it means &quot;make the working tree like what is in HEAD&quot;. Sometimes it means &quot;no, don&#x27;t touch the working tree, but change HEAD to a particular revision&quot;. Sometimes it means &quot;don&#x27;t touch HEAD or the working tree: make the index look like a particular revision&quot;.<p>Want interactivity?

E.g., I have seen remarks about how modern Schemes have moved away from it at least a little bit, with syntax which is importantly not quite a list, though I don&#x27;t know any of the details. And CL has other kinds of reader magic --- like one-character &quot;reader macros&quot; and like the implicit package which is used as a default for symbols at read time when no explicit package is given --- that can in principle complicate the obvious 1-1 correspondence between source and parsed-as-list representation, although in practice that magic is very seldom used in such a way that you need to think about it.)",1415895036

Instead, Amazon gave the gift cards to everyone that used Discover for a 1-click digital purchase, the vast majority of whom <i>already</i> had Discover as their default 1-Click purchase card. Discover&#x27;s $500K budget was predictably drained in rapid fashion, and they barely got any of the actions they had agreed to pay for. The author of this letter was encouraged to hide this fact, pitch it as an overwhelming success of the campaign, and to ask Discover to expand the budget. He was fired after complaining about being uncomfortable with participating in obvious fraud against their 2nd largest advertiser, and is now suing Amazon.<p>The failures here occurred in every department. First, at a fundamental technical level, I don&#x27;t understand how this could happen in the first place if it wasn&#x27;t intentional.  This was a simple CPA campaign.  When someone <i>changed</i> their default card to Discover, they got a gift card.  So it begins with their &quot;ad execution team&quot;.  Second, the moment the problem was discovered, they should have simply credited the campaign such that they were only charged for the actions they agreed and intended to pay for.  Third, any employee actively involved in encouraging fraud, let alone fraud against their 2nd largest advertiser, should be fired. Their engineering, marketing, legal, and HR teams all failed miserably on this one.<p>I don&#x27;t envision myself ever having a need to run a CPA campaign through Amazon, but based on this I would stay away from them as much as possible.  They had to have multiple internal discussions about whether or not they should <i>commit a crime</i> against a multi-million dollar advertiser.

845107,comment,844787,844995,0,0,vaksel,,,"Oh yeah, you def need to implement that. Thing is, that most people will search for a song that fits the type they want. So letting the genre wander, just delivers them wrong results.<p>i.e. you start out with Hip Hop, then eventually you'll hit a song that is Hip Hop/Country, then you'll hit a song that's Country/Country, and then you are stuck listening for 3 hours to country music. Until you hit Country/Hip-Hop and get out of the loop.<p>You could probably expand the options a little bit by making a few mutually exclusive lists. For example someone whose initial search was a country music song, probably doesn't want to ever hear gangsta rap. And vice versa.<p>As far as trying to figure out the mood, I don't think that's plausible. The whole like/dislike/forward thing isn't going to get you the results you want. For example, I might ""like"" a song, but it doesn't mean I want to start hearing more songs like that at the moment. The dislike/forward is mostly used to skip past the songs that don't fit my initial criteria.<p>I think it's something that you are better off leaving for your users to do manually. If they want to start hearing new types of music, they'll just search for a new song. There is no real reason to try to guesstimate their mood, since chances are you'll just get it wrong and will ruin the user experience.<p>Oh and here is another suggestion for auto-play, let users use it without searching for the initial song. Use it as a ""Play me a random song"" button. This way users can discover new music.",1253943429

In fact, if anything, I think linking it to overall karma score may tend to <i>increase</i> obsession with karma, because now I have to watch my overall karma like a hawk and spend time thinking about the likely source of change to determine whether I've stepped on my dick somewhere.<p>I say bring back the ability to see one's own karma, perhaps with a preferences option to turn it off, regardless of what happens with the visibility of others' comment scores.<p>In fact, if anything about one's own karma would be hidden, I think the overall score would be a better choice to hide than the scores of (one's own) individual comments.",1253942999

Amid such tragedy, it's best to have the legal framework 'on rails' so that you don't really have to think about it.  Anybody dealing with the death of a friend and business partner has enough on their plate already.<p>Here's our solution, in case other people are interested:<p>In event of the death of a member (we're an LLC), that member's economic interests revert to their estate, but the inheritors lose all power to vote or make decisions.<p>Within 180 days, the surviving member can elect to buy out the deceased member's interest at a reasonable valuation.  There's some legalese in determining ""reasonable valuation"", but the upshot is that the surviving members may take complete control of the company so long as the inheritors of the deceased are properly compensated.<p>If a buyout doesn't occur, then the inheritors of the estate become silent partners unless there's a mutual agreement to instate them as a full partner.<p>Despite what some people say, vesting is not always the answer.  A lot of vesting mechanisms leave the door open for somebody to get screwed out of their rightful share.  Personally, I'd rather see someone undeserving get rewarded, rather than see a deserving person get shafted.<p>One more thing:  To Rex (the OP), my sincerest condolences.  Losing a business partner is hard, losing a close friend is orders of magnitude harder.  I think I can speak for the whole HN community in saying that you have our sympathy and understanding.",1253941838

845056,comment,844979,844979,0,0,tc,,,"Wow, this interferes with key elements of my system for voting/commenting on HN.  Here are some things that don't work now:<p>* If a comment is sitting at 1 or 0, I'll try to avoid downvoting it unless I really think the comment subtracts value from the site.<p>* If a child is attracting more votes than the parent, and I think this is because the child commenter didn't comprehend what the parent was saying, I vote to level out the comments.<p>* If I see a comment sitting in negative territory that I feel should only be a 0 or 1 because it wasn't that bad, I'll upvote it even if I otherwise wouldn't have.<p>* If a thread is already dominated by a couple of high-scoring comments, relative to its age, I'm less likely to post a new top level comment.  My feeling is that if a good comment just sits at the bottom because it arrived slightly too late, I've only added noise to the thread.  The lack of visible points makes it much harder to gauge how a new comment will 'compete' on the thread.<p>* If the scores indicate that something is being widely misunderstood, I might comment where I otherwise would not have to try to restore sanity.<p>Of course, if this change were to stick, it would alter the character of the site, and we would all develop new voting and commenting systems.  I can already tell that this change magnifies my tendency to vote with an eye toward reordering comments rather than voting on each comment in relative isolation.",1253941781

845051,comment,843732,844883,0,0,apotheon,,,"Alas, I think you may be right.  I haven't been using it very long.<p>Once I actually buckled down and started learning how to use it, I was surprised by how quickly and easily a natural feeling of ""this is how it should be"" developed while using Vimperator.  Of course, there's a lot of positive transference of knowledge from my heavy use of Vim itself, but still -- I didn't expect to find it this easy.<p>I think part of the reason may be that every single keyboard-driven browser I have ever used before (Lynx, W3m, Links, et cetera, ad infinitum) was so awful as a Web interface that I became convinced Web browsers were a uniquely GUI-suited type of application.  Vimperator is definitely changing my mind.<p>Thank goodness.",1253941566

I wonder if it should (or already does) slightly lengthen the time for longer words, as it does for words with a period; other punctuation pauses would be good too. The period pause helps comprehension a lot.

The global production rate of quality movies is much less than 3 per week. Once you've exhausted* the catalogue then you're either stuck waiting for new releases or you resign to watching movies you're not that interested in. It's laudable that Netflix is trying to hip people to obscure movies that they'll hopefully like (and make money at it, because obscure movies are cheap) but more often than not the movie just sucks. There's a lot of crap out there. Wasting 2 hours on a shit movie burns bad enough that I don't gamble my time on it anymore.<p>(* I know this sounds ridiculous but some people just don't enjoy movies made before they were born. Most movies are not timeless, and the timeless ones you're likely to have already seen.)",1253941402

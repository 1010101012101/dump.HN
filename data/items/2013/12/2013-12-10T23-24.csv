It&#x27;s kinda crazy.  I certainly don&#x27;t live in a completely walkable city neighborhood back east, but I can be at the office in ~25 minutes on my bike, and most errands can be done on my bike or my scooter.<p>As for high costs, I think it&#x27;s all a trade-off, right?  We&#x27;re a one car family (I&#x27;ve never actually driven to work in 15+ years), but we travel extensively in our VW van.  So, the benefits we get from owning it out-weigh the costs.  That said, I&#x27;ve applied the same analysis to owning a car for getting to work--it&#x27;s far cheaper, and more enjoyable, for me to bike (and occasionally take the bus) rather than deal with another vehicle.  I suspect most car-bound commuters (or suburbanites who must drive 15-30 minutes to get anywhere) have done similar math in their head (or on paper), and decided that the benefits of location and car ownership out-weight the costs.  Of course, plenty of those folks also likely complain about gas prices and traffic, too!",1386719806

The problem is, that holographic principle ( or similar) can mean different things depending on the context. But in string theories, it is sometimes the case that lower dimensional theories can encode the same information as the full string theory. Just as illustration, if the endpoints of your strings are stuck on a two dimensional plane, but the strings can vibrate in three dimensions, then you can potentially describe the system as a theory of the endpoints in two dimensions ( and the vibration mode of the string would potentially be encoded as the type of particle), or you can describe how the strings move through three dimensions.<p>As for recommended reading, I liked Brian Green&#x27;s <i>The Elegant Universe</i>.",1386719443

6884785,comment,6880117,6884300,1,0,rayiner,,,"Here&#x27;s the thing. I don&#x27;t even disagree that the U.S. has badly handled the situation with the Guantanamo detainees. It&#x27;s valid to detain prisoners during a war, but they should be repatriated after hostilities cease. You have to acknowledge that the U.S. is in a rough spot, because 30% of detainees returned to Afghanistan started fighting again against the U.S., and for many of the detainees, the home countries didn&#x27;t want them back. And the U.S. states were totally unwilling to even host trials for the detainees on their soil, particularly Virginia where many of those trials would have been held. But there were probably better ways to handle the detainees.<p>However, this has nothing to do with the comparison between the U.S. and Stalinist Russia. The latter detained <i>Russian citizens</i> because of their political opposition to the regime. Those are political prisoners. Or, for other examples, people like Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for political opposition to the South African government.<p>There is an enormous difference between a country&#x27;s internal political institutions and its shortcomings in the conduct of war on foreign soil with respect to foreigners. You can&#x27;t just pretend these are the same thing. This is a distinction that American law takes very seriously: John Walker Lindh was recognized as an American, despite being captured with Afghan fighters in Afghanistan, was never held in Guantanamo, and was given a criminal trial in the U.S.<p>Trials and due process are protections that Americans are entitled to when they are accused of <i>crimes</i>. Foreigners suspected of making war against the U.S. and captured on foreign soil are simply not entitled to these things. It&#x27;s not a &quot;crime&quot; to wage war against the U.S., it&#x27;s not something that falls within the jurisdiction of criminal courts. It&#x27;s something that falls within the sovereign right of a nation to defend itself against foreign attackers. The rules and standards of conduct are totally different.",1386719396

6884760,comment,6882744,6883730,10,0,philjr,,,"This is great information and I too would consider long and hard before laying out significant sums of cash early on. You&#x27;re completely subject to market risk and you&#x27;ve just handed over some of your own money. Everyone&#x27;s appetite for risk here is different...<p>That being said, my own personal opinion is, if you&#x27;re in early enough that options are on the table, you&#x27;ve basically taken a bet on the company anyway and you&#x27;re probably already sacrificing salary for equity. I wouldn&#x27;t go mortgaging the house to purchase your options, but it&#x27;s unlikely that&#x27;s necessary and if you&#x27;re seeing strike prices of under a couple of dollars per share, then you&#x27;re probably talking about very affordable options.<p>In Ireland, the main tax differential is income tax (effective rate of 52%) or CGT (@30%). I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to this, so word to the wise of anyone going through this. Go talk to someone now, not when your company is IPO&#x27;ing.<p>Some interesting tidbits here from an Irish perspective which probably applies to lots of other non-US countries on options in US companies:<p>* Pre-IPO, the fair market value of the share is calculated and reported to the revenue commissioner along with an FX (USD -> EUR) rate set by the ECB. Talk to your finance/accounts dept. who are obliged to report this periodically. This fair market value determines the amount of tax you pay.<p>* The difference between the fair market value of the share and the strike price is essentially counted as income (not BIK, not CGI) when you exercise. In a lot of cases (Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, Workday) the fair market value of the share was substantially less pre-IPO (12 months, 24 months) than post-IPO. That means exercising early in most of these situations would have been to your advantage if you were at these companies. Be aware you&#x27;re completely subject to market risk here.<p>* Once you exercise the options and own the stock, then increases are subject to capital gains. An example here might be if the strike price on your options is $1, the fair market value is $2 & your company IPOs at some point in the future at $10. If you purchased options at the earlier milestone with a fair market value of $2 and sold at IPO, you&#x27;d pay 52% tax on $1 ($2 - $1) and CGT (30%) on $8 ($10 - $2). If you purchased at IPO and sold immediately, you&#x27;d pay income tax on $9 ($10 - $1). However, you need to actually hand over cash to exercise options and pay the tax, so be very aware that this is essentially now an investment.<p>* FX (USD/EUR) fluctuations can be just as important as stock fluctuations. Make sure you take that in to account. Right now, for example, this isn&#x27;t quite in your favour, with the USD to EUR rate at high 1.35&#x27;s/1.37&#x27;s lately. Look at the currency history. You have options to sell and hold your money in USD (banks in Europe will typically open you a USD account) in which case you can hold until you believe the FX rate comes in line with what you expect. Again, you are subject to market risk here (your investments may go up as well as down!). In Ireland, gains via FX like this are also subject to CGT.<p>I&#x27;m not a tax advisor, but what I hope I&#x27;m convincing most people here is that if you do think you just hopped on a rocket ship (a Twitter, Google, Facebook) and you&#x27;re a non-US resident with a reasonably significant amount of options (1,000+), I&#x27;d go talk with a tax consultant immediately and consider at least purchasing some of your options up-front if you&#x27;ve got cash that you&#x27;re willing to bet with.<p>We&#x27;ve had a number of high profile IPO&#x27;s here in Dublin recently (LinkedIn, Facebook, Workday & Twitter) so hopefully this convinces someone who jumps on the next one to go talk to a tax advisor.",1386719119

For example, I took about half of my savings and bought bitcoins - all my bank can see is, that the money &quot;vanished&quot;, and they can&#x27;t collect any more fees from services they could offer me handling those money. Actually, no bank knows where the value now is, since I made a lot of BTC transactions since then.<p>It&#x27;s same with the wealthy people - yes, they will not feel comfortable about the idea that other individuals will own most wealth in the future. But what can they do about it? It&#x27;s like today: most people are not comfortable with the fact that just a few individuals or their families control 90% of the total wealth, but that is about all they can do, feel uncomfortable about it.<p>With bitcoin it&#x27;s similar, it&#x27;s not that bitcoin will succeed only by making banks and rich people comfortable, bitcoin might succeed despite that.<p>Also, I realized an interesting property about the BTC network, which is not talked about much. Namely, people who invested into BTC, do not have much incentive to do damage to the network, since that would only cause the BTC value to go down, and they would incur loses to themselves - they will realize, that by behaving &quot;properly&quot; they can gain more.<p>It&#x27;s more possible that some hostile government or other entity will try to sink bitcoin, but it might be hard to achieve.

One almost universal facet of the alternatives to cars that people suggest is that they limit where you can enter and exit the system. You can&#x27;t use a train to navigate to anywhere you want to go: you use it to get close and then use some other way of getting the rest of the way. Remove other transit systems, and this will effectively set property values. Want to open a store? Well, if you&#x27;re an established player with easy access to capital through the investment bank that handled your last merger, than the cost of leasing or purchasing property with reasonable access via transportation is fairly easy. But if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re probably not going to be able to afford that. You&#x27;re going to have to locate yourself in a far less accessible location. And the value proposition of your business now has to overcome this difference as well in addition to regular value you would offer. From a consumer standpoint, this means you have fewer alternatives. Things have to be pretty bad with your existing supplier of a good or service for you to switch if doing so is going to entail a higher inconvenience in terms of access. I saw this all the time in Chicago. People could charge a premium beyond what their higher rent would require simply because they knew that you would be reluctant to walk another 15 minutes to get to someone who was charging 10-20% less per item.<p>There are additional fixed costs that would go with the logistical concerns a model like this would entail. How are you going to get things to and from your business? The constructs are going to most likely favor established methods. Say we don&#x27;t allow cars to drive, but we do decide that we need the infrastructure to allow 18-wheelers to get through, and you can use that method instead. Well now you need a loading dock. Now you either need to pay someone else a premium for hauling it for you or buy an 18-wheeler yourself. You can&#x27;t simply use the car you were already using to commute to your day job while trying to start this new business. You can&#x27;t sacrifice additional time to lower the cots. You are effectively confined to hiring other people to do it for you because of the system.<p>In short, it makes the system much more rigid. It leaves fewer feasible alternatives both for the consumer and the provider. It also makes barriers to entry far higher.",1386718007

Sure, it&#x27;s not unheard of that people collaborate, but even bigger projects usually follow the idea that what you publish is yours, so you are more likely to see a publication series with individual volumes by different people, or the above mentioned collections, where (maybe!) introductions or overviews are written collaboratively.<p>This has partly to do with the dreadful &quot;tooling&quot; in many cases, i.e. in most cases Word with handwritten citations.

Having to commute (walk) to your commute (bus) then commute again (walk) sucks when the weather is bad. Public transport with more than one leg in the trip sucks.

As you correctly point out, killing in self-defense is considered legitimate by most (but certainly not all) people. If someone pulls out a gun and starts shooting at me, most people would agree that it is morally acceptable to pull out a gun and shoot my attacker. But the legitimacy of that self-defense is limited by the principle of proportionality. If instead I pull out an AK-47 and rake back and forth with indiscriminate automatic fire, killing not only my attacker but also 15 innocent bystanders, pretty much everyone would agree that I acted immorally. The death of my attacker would be in self-defense, but I&#x27;d still be on the hook for 15 murders.<p>That second example is more akin to taking antibiotics. If we accept that killing microbes is wrong, and accept your argument that using antibiotics is moral because it&#x27;s legitimate self-defense, we have a problem. Antibiotics kill a lot more than just the invading bacteria. So does radiation and chemotherapy. In fact, they kill a lot of microbes who live in a symbiotic relationship with me and live in my body because they help me break down food or fight infections.<p>The point is, things are  a lot more complicated than simply saying that all forms of killing are immoral. At some point we have to accept that there is an ordering of life forms, and killing some of them to save ourselves is acceptable. If we don&#x27;t, using antibiotics, chemotherapy, radiation, or other similar forms of care crucial to modern medicine is immoral. Once we accept that not all killing is wrong, it becomes an issue of line-drawing.",1386716624

A comfortable 15k/km^2 density (like Tokyo or Mexico City, half the density of Paris) is plenty enough to promote transit and network effects and build diverse and concentrated arts and business districts without concentrating them in only one part of town. That density is comfortably achieved with median two and three story buildings and plenty of open space in Mexico City and mostly short free standing homes in Tokyo.",1386716552

These people may or may not exist, depending on how attractive the company is.  The shares you purchase from the company will likely be restricted, and you won&#x27;t be able to transfer them for a year.  After that year is up, you can sell it to whomever you wish.  The company will have right of first refusal, but if it comes to that, you don&#x27;t really care who buys the shares off of you (company or secondary market investor) because you get paid the same either way.<p>This is technically different that what Alex is proposing, but the end result is fairly similar.  He&#x27;s offering to loan you money to exercise.  You keep ownership of the shares, and the loan comes due if and when there is a liquid market for the shares.  He&#x27;s allowing you to move on from the company before any other investor is interested in the shares, but still provide upside to you if and when the shares are actually worth something.  And he takes some cut because he&#x27;s assuming the (very significant) risk that no other investor is ever willing to pay for the shares.",1386716497

This means that the previous theory had unnecessary redundancy, so the new theory has less cruft.<p>The hologram is their way of describing how they changed their way of thinking to land on this new theory. So they looked at the problem with the idea that the interactions in our universe could be a projection of the interactions in some other universe.<p>The breakthrough is that they found such a universe ours could be a projection of, and that universe can be described with less parameters than the previous leading theory.<p>The smaller a theory is, the more clear its foundational relationships will be, so the closer we are to actually understanding why things are like they are.<p>So previously we had a big question, why does our theory of everything require 18 (or more?) dimensions to describe the universe?<p>And now we have a slightly smaller question: Why does our theory of everything require 10 dimensions to describe the universe?",1386716422

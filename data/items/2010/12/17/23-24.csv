But honestly, the difference is the product. A browser is free to the final customer, has no real hoops to jump through before release, and since all browser makers have been heading to the same basic goal for over a decade and (mostly) adhere to a standard, there is not really anything to gain from secrecy. A phone/tablet costs money to the final user, has to go through OEMs, carriers, and the Feds before it can be in anyone's hands. Not to mention that we are in the infancy of mobile computing and secrets can give a real advantage.

2018355,comment,2018041,2018041,0,0,grellas,,,"My two cents (check with a good CPA or tax lawyer to make sure, as my specialty is not tax law, though I generally have a good working knowledge of the subject - be ready to get bleary-eyed, though, this is <i>tax</i>, and think of it as a basic overview only):<p>For years (since 1993), section 1202 of the U.S. tax code has provided a <i>partial</i> exclusion of gain realized on the sale of ""qualified small business stock"" (QSB stock) that is held for more than 5 years.<p>The big glitches under the law as it has heretofore existed: (a) the exclusion was only partial (for many years, only 50% but higher for qualifying stock acquired in 2009 and in 2010 prior to September 27); and (b) a portion of any gain that was so excluded had to be added back as a preference for AMT purposes. Thus, this exclusion had more limited value over the years that it has now, during this current window.<p>The benefit of a ""section 1202 exclusion"" today is that 100% of the gain realized is excluded (subject to a cap as discussed below) and the exclusion applies for purposes of both the regular federal income tax and the alternative minimum tax.<p>Thus, if a taxpayer today acquires qualifying QSB stock, holds it for more than 5 years, and then sells it at a gain, the gain on that sale will be completely free of federal income tax.<p>Who is a qualified buyer of such stock? The exclusion may be claimed by any ""taxpayer"" who meets the statutory requirements. It is not limited to ""investors"" but includes anyone who buys stock in a qualifying corporation and otherwise meets the section-1202 tests. This <i>would</i> include founders.<p>The exclusion may <i>not</i> be claimed if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, and this is important for VCs, angel groups and others who might be organized as some form of partnership, the gain from the disposition of qualified small business stock by a partnership, an S corporation, or certain trusts that is taken into account by a partner, shareholder or participant in such entity <i>is</i> eligible for section-1202 exclusion if (a) all requirements of section 1202 are otherwise met, and (b) the partner, shareholder or other participant held his interest in the entity on the date the QSB stock was acquired and at all times thereafter until the stock's disposition. Bottom line on this piece: corporations can't benefit from a 1202 exclusion but some entities can - check with a competent tax adviser on this - as can individual investors and founders.<p>A ""qualified small business"" under section 1202 is a domestic C corporation. An S corporation will not qualify; nor will an LLC.<p>In addition, to be a ""qualified small business,"" the gross assets of the entity through the date of the issuance of the stock in question cannot have exceeded $50 million without regard to liabilities.<p>The business must also be an ""active business"" - that is, it cannot be an investment company (entities will fail this test if more than 10% of the value of their net assets consists of stock or securities, other than those of a subsidiary, and will similarly fail if more than 10% of their assets consist of real property that is not used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business).<p>Concerning such ""qualified small businesses,"" then, what is ""qualified small business stock""?<p>This can be <i>any</i> stock in a domestic C corporation. Not preferred stock only, as might be purchased by outside investors. It is <i>any</i> stock, including common stock that is purchased by founders and others in a typical startup.<p>It must be stock that is ""originally issued"" to the taxpayer during the applicable time period (in this case, on or after September 27, 2010 through the date of expiration of the window for 100% exclusion). This means newly issued from the corporation. It can't be bought in a resale deal. Nor can the corporation and the taxpayer play games by trading equivalents (e.g., by redeeming x amount of stock from the taxpayer and then issuing it again to him); thus, it is not QSB stock if the corporation purchases any such stock from the shareholder/taxpayer within two years before or after the issuance of the shares for which the exclusion is sought. Section 1202 treatment will also be denied if, within one year before or after the issuance, the corporation redeems more than 5% of the aggregate value of all its stock as measured at the beginning of such period (certain redemptions, such as on death, are disregarded for this purpose).<p>Finally, to qualify as QSB stock, the stock must be acquired by the taxpayer in exchange for money or other property (not including stock) or as compensation for services provided to the corporation (this was the rule historically under section 1202 but please confirm with a good CPA or tax lawyer to make sure this carries forward during the 100% exclusion window - I think it does but am not 100% sure - to be safe, pay cash). Nothing in the rules specifies that the amount paid has to exceed any particular sum and so the amounts typically contributed by founders should generally qualify.<p>The 1202 exclusion is capped. Specifically, a taxpayer can exclude qualifying gain up to the limit of the <i>greater of</i> $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer's basis in the stock. Even more, this is measured ""per issuer,"" meaning that someone who holds QSB stock in multiple, unrelated entities and otherwise meets the rules in each case would be able to exclude a potentially very large amount of gain if multiple entities proved to be success cases.<p>To sum up: if you as a non-corporate taxpayer acquire QSB stock during this window and hold it for more than 5 years, you will be able to realize substantial gains on the eventual sale of any such stock free of federal income tax.<p>Now, this is a very complex tax area and so you should definitely check with a competent tax professional before making important decisions here. That said, from the narrow view of startup founders and investors (and setting aside public policy concerns about the wisdom of this sort of legislation), this is a pretty amazing opportunity for those who have plan to invest or build out their ventures for the long term. With a whole year to plan for it (assuming this is finalized as anticipated), many interesting possibilities exist. Think of the above as suggestive, of things to consider in weighing options for such planning.",1292629731

2018353,comment,2018272,2018272,0,0,hristov,,,"I urge that guy to find a patent attorney. It can be very dangerous to represent yourself in such a case. It is usually dangerous to represent yourself, but for patent cases it is 10 times more dangerous, because:<p>(1) patent law is very complex. Even ordinary lawyers usually will not litigate patent cases unless they specialize in patent law only. Insurance companies will usually not insure attorneys that do not specialize in patent law for patent work.<p>(2) damages for patent cases can be very large. Damages can often break a company.<p>I read the post and he says some things that are simply wrong. For example the following statement:<p>""In order to be infringing on a patent, a person or entity must be infringing on every one of the claims that are linked together.

This device may change the projection of the 3D space on their 2D space, but it will not magically make the third dimension pop out.<p>-- original post, a bit less synthetic.<p>Color is a 3D space (wherever you chose to put the axes, RGB, HSL...) because we have three subtypes of color-related light detectors, called cones, in our retina (there are more photosensitive cells, but they aren't involved in color).<p>Each cone is sensitive to a range of the visible spectrum, with peak sensitivity respectively in what we call red, green and blue. These ranges are overlapping, though, which allows our brain to interpret monochromatic light correctly by weighting the response of each type of cone.<p>See [1] for a schema and a more thorough explanation.<p>Note also that magenta exists as a color (ie unique subjective experience), even though no monochromatic light can evoke it. You get it  by stimulating the red and the blue cones, sparring the green one.<p>All of this to say that with two cones, you're stuck in a 2D space of color blindness.<p>This tool may help colorblind people to get a different projection of the 3D space in their 2D detection field, but they will not be able to perceive the 3D space at once.<p>--<p>For those who didn't get their dose of photoreceptors trivia:<p>The retina also contains another type of detectors called rods, which are much more sensitive to light than the cones, and is involved in both day and night vision whereas the cones are only stimulated in daylight This explains why you don't percieve colors in the darkness.<p>At last, the recently discovered melanopsin containing ganglion cells are involved in the circadian cycle and other light-related acivity in the autonomous nevous system.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unm.edu/~toolson/human_cone_response.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unm.edu/~toolson/human_cone_response.htm</a>",1292629013

Pricing the stock also has implications for the grant of future equity incentives to other key people and so you need to consider not only pricing but also issues such as having to do a 409A valuation the next time you grant options to anyone in the company.</i><p><i>... The company would need to authorize their conversion in the absence of a qualified funding and will need to authorize a form of preferred stock into which they can convert. It is possible, of course, to have the notes convert into common stock but this puts a very high value on the common and makes it difficult to grant future incentive stock to key people without pricing it at a high level (the law allows as much as a 5 to 1 pricing differential between preferred and common and so, if preferred stock is used instead of common, you can still make future incentive grants at 1/5th the price of the preferred).</i><p>This led me to conclude that it's not worthwhile to convert, and George confirmed:<p><i>I think it is marginal for the company and its noteholders at this point and makes sense only if there is a fairly strong sense that people will hold for 5 more years. It would inject at least several thousand in costs (at least $10K, with some $5K to $7K out of pocket as a lump sum, if a 409A appraisal should be needed to price option grants and the like) and would add tax complications in terms of stock pricing in the short term – and so, yes, I would say you should likely skip it.</i><p>That said, if you are looking to invest in a great start-up and this tax break is meaningful to you, shoot me an email, and I'll send you my pitch :)",1292628303

Since it's online, most likely only the laws of the state where you host are applied (even for foreign countries, that's how French could play on online casinos before). You might simply host that feature and a subsidiary for it in a state with online-gambling friendly laws. Maybe Nevada, maybe some states or countries have no laws at all on it and even no taxes.<p>If it's free I'd say it either fall in (free) lottery or contest, it's hard to tell. Either way your best approach is simply host it in a state with no laws at all on the matter.

It allows the danger to <i>command</i> your attention in a way logic alone can never achieve. It also stimulates the whole fight-or-flight response, souping you up with chemicals in case you need 'em. It has it's limitations, but on the whole it does a much better job than logic would alone IMHO.<p>Being geekish myself, I totally understand the desire to replace everything with cool, calculating logic, but our basic instincts usually do a pretty damn good job. An easy example is if you put your hand on a hot stove, you will instinctively pull away, often even before you feel pain or heat. If you relied on logic (<i>gee, this stove is hot and my hand hurts! I should pull my hand away</i>) your burn would be much, much worse.",1292626886

Yup, I am committed to the product and thankfully it has been positioned as one of the easiest website optimization products available. What I meant by the comment was that I was quite impressed by W3ROI as a product and thought it was a consistent effort. But when I realized it is a ""5 hour"" effort, I was really surprised.<p>Rest assured the product isn't going anywhere. I have built a team (not a single man effort anymore) and is a serious startup now. What I said was a bit like hyperbole, sorry if it came across as I am abandoning the product :)",1269158374

1207684,comment,1207494,1207494,0,0,jpr,,,"Rather strange rant. I hope it was trying to be funny, but if so, it failed miserably.<p>Anyway, what I find interesting is that Java really is <i>very</i> slow in one thing: startup time. My completely unscientific test concluded that a hello world -program in written in Java takes about 0.110 seconds to run, while the C version took about 0.003 seconds. What's interesting, Python version takes about 0.015 seconds, which includes parsing, compiling to bytecode and interpreting it, while the Java version has already been parsed and compiled. I would like to know what explains this almost tenfold difference between Java and Python startup times. I suspect it might have to do with the security features of Java?",1269157377

This had the added advantage that if the same record was inserted more than once, it would not result in duplicates.""<p>The 'correct' way to deal with this in MySQL is using the auto_increment_increment.<p><a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variabl...</a><p>Of course, the real difficulty with mutli-master setups split across data centres isn't ensuring uniqueness of primary keys, it's ensuring data-integrity under a split-brain scenario, i.e. where one server can't reach the other, but users can reach one or the other.  UPDATEs and DELETEs to rows can then become extremely difficult to merge back together.
This wasn't a problem for this application, but as others have commented, this use case probably wasn't best suited for an RDBMS anyway.",1269156564

Today I flew from JFK - SFO, and I didn't bother to unpack my carry-on toiletry kit, which had a number of liquids and gels (albeit all under 3.4oz).
On the outside of my backpack, however, I had my 12oz bottle of contact lens solution, which they seemingly no longer bother to check. A year ago they would ask me to take it out  so they could check it (some kind of vapor on paper test) but they haven't done so the last few times I've been through security.<p>On a similar note, people concerned with explosives on airplanes should consider the fact that the majority of cargo (non-passenger underbelly packages, which are on nearly every flight nowadays) are never screened, in any way. Wouldn't be hard to get a detonator (cell phone?) through security or to detonate remotely.",1269156502

1207666,comment,1207058,1207592,0,0,EricBurnett,,,"A limited form of what you are describing already exists. MediaWiki supports something called 'interwiki links',* so you can write e.g. [[TVtropes:PlotThreads]] to link directly to the Plot Threads page on TV tropes. In this way many disparate wikis can be wired together quite simply, if desired. I don't remember if the software supports shared indexes or backlinks or anything of that kind, however, although that is available between sister projects (such as Wikipedia and Wikitionary).<p>Culturally, however, Wikipedia seems to frown upon using this kind of link to external encyclopedias. If information is notable, it should be included in Wikipedia or one of the sister projects; if it is a source, it should be referenced as such. Any kind of 'more information' external page doesn't really have a place in such a system. So we're back to needing to 'fix' Wikipedia.<p>* See <a href=""http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Interwiki_map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Interwiki_map</a> for the current list of supported interwiki prefixes.",1269155795

While you're spending days writing mallocs and copying function pointers in C, your competitor is using one of these ""lazy programmers"" languages and implementing features in hours. Features that are going to take you days to write.  Once scale is needed, your competitor just goes out and spends $700 on a cheap server and matches your performance.

And I make more money (and just generally get a lot more projects done) by managing other programmers.<p>Regarding 'backwater corners' - isn't this article about how to provide value in the backwater corners of the software industry? Printing and generating bingo cards is about as backwater as you can get, but I see nothing wrong with that. I'm also in the food industry and I understand that you don't grow up to be McDonald's (a restaurant which has - from my perspective - provided incredible value all over the world) overnight.

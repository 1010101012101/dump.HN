The fact is that oil was a technology that substantially <i>decreased</i> pollution. The proof of that is that water and air quality has been improving steadily over the years since the 1800's (partly because of legislation, but largely because of technology. You can't legislate away horse manure - but you can legislate cars with cleaner engines.)<p>So yeah, I look forward to the day when oil is obsoleted in favor of some magic green energy source that produces no pollution (although rest assured, people will find something else to bitch and moan about.) Until then, I'll breathe a silent ""thank you"" to the grimiest oil refinery out there for making my life that much easier.",1274752615

Rip the tail off a B-52, and I would expect it to rapidly tumble and subsequently disintegrate with unpleasant consequences for those inside. Furthermore, ejecting is probably more likely to succeed in straight and level flight than from a tumbling aircraft. For both reasons, it is desirable to eject quickly once it becomes necessary.<p>Additionally, a 10 second wait is unnecessary. We see from fighter ejector seats that ejection can be done in just a few seconds. What can possibly be gained by remaining once the seat is ready to eject?",1274752583

One way of achieving that is to move to their side of the table, and make a list of the consequences, and have them agree - preferably in writing, an email will do - that they take responsibility for any consequences of doing it 'their way', and that any work over and beyond the agreed upon will be billed separately.<p>That might make them a lot more amendable to reason.",1274752382

All your friends in industry are already earning nearly 100k and have been earning decent salaries all the while you were in graduate school and post-docs for the past eight years. They already have houses, cars, and other items giving them some form of security. You are maybe in debt, and have very little if not.<p>Now you get to work for five years to earn your tenure. You work nights, maybe weekends. Your salary is better, but not that much better than your friends got out of university.  At the end of the five years, you may be denied tenure. Are you going to give it another shot after that? Another five years?<p>Also, ""and often times at / above industry (that's true at least in Canada anyways)"", I do not see this to be true. Especially not for people of similar technical skill who work hard and long hours.<p>The biggest reason people do not pursue a tenure track position is a distinct lack of a safety net.

(B) is a style of playing God, and it's the use of force.<p>Fundamentally, it's irrational to force people who disagree with you to do things your way if they don't see why it's best -- to make them go against their best judgment (also irrational to deny they have best judgment, attribute their ideas to things other than thought, and so deny the disagreement exists at all, and forcibly override them on that basis). The only rational thing to do if you want a (B) style world is persuade people, which is not at all the same as campaigning for laws to force people.<p>And by the way, straight, white, Christian males go to extraordinary and ridiculous lengths to prove themselves, all the time. For example, working super hard in school for 10 years to gain credentials. That's ridiculous and only loosely correlated to actual merit.

With the right construction, you can convey arbitrary emotions with any medium -- but with writing, you can try a few versions and pick the best.  You can ""un-say"" things, and you can revise until your message makes sense.<p>I think the reason why people think written communication is ineffective, is because most people just can't write.<p>Personally, I think I talk like I write, which makes my oral communication less effective.  As I'm talking, if I think of something else to say, I have to revise my previous statements so that the listener ends up with the same mental picture as me.  This takes time and words.  When writing, though, I can just delete the thing that I didn't really want to say, and replace it with the better version.  This saves the reader time and makes me look better.

I did a promising experiment last week and we need to work through some of the details.<p>It could be said that IE aspires to support Bespin ;)  IE9 is going to have considerably improved support for the latest standards, and there are rumors that it will support Canvas, which is how Bespin draws its text. We also use CSS3 flexible boxes to lay out the interface. Using those advanced features, Bespin supports Firefox, Safari and Chrome.<p>Granted our ""modern browsers only"" policy means that Bespin isn't right for some applications. That's okay with us.

They're okay students and can fight their way through an undergrad program, but give them a year or two in the workforce to come up to speed, and they never really develop an ability to attack hard problems.  They just kind of flail at problems unproductively, rely on peers to bail them out, generally make a mess of the codebase, and cry if you criticize them.<p>Suppose the world is like that.  And suppose, then, we have a woman who bucks the trend -- really <i>can</i> code, but is new to the industry.<p>Which is the better world?<p>(A) The talented woman can't get a job, or has to go to extreme lengths to prove herself, over and over again, throughout her career.

Hence, many women in the graduating class of C.S. majors land jobs and are predictably incompetent.  But the one talented woman <i>also</i> gets a job.<p>Personally, I find (A) vastly preferable.

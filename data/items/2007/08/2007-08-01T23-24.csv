You pick a subdomain (for example, ""something"").  Then it puts all those on <a href=""http://something.ytmnd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://something.ytmnd.com</a>.  Each day, around 100,000 of these are viewed, so it chews up a huge amount of bandwidth.<p>Max is the owner of that site, and he's been living off of the advertising revenue at about the same living status as someone working full time at McDonald's.  Last I heard, the advertising pulls in about $20k per month, and the bandwidth takes about $18k per month.  He works all day and night on it.. it's amazing.  I don't know why he hasn't sought investors or anything like that, but it's a huge community (even though it consists largely of teenagers).<p>Any investors who like investing in that sort of thing might want to contact him.",1186011844

A lot of people essentially spent a bunch of years working for chump, in widely shared anticipation of riches that never materialized.<p>	At the same time, since not nearly as many outsiders are betting their life savings on the 'bubblers', the economy wide impact of even the most devastating sector wipeout, won't be nearly as bad as dot bomb.<p>	In that respect, how you'll come to view it will depend largely on where you stand.<p>	It could also be that what we are seeing is the leading edge of PG's predicted trend for more young people to enter working life by doing a startup, rather than going to work for someone. This would probably in and of itself lead to an economic landscape looking a bit 'bubbly' by historical standards.<p>	I guess only time will tell.

Less/no need to write homegrown, production quality c/c++ interfaces, since it integrates with the rest of .net. It will compile some/most ocaml code without too much change. I can't help but think using it, or at least being aware of it, can benefit some software startups.",1186009425

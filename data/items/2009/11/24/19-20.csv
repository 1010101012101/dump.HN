He wasn't deliberately lying; actually, it was because he had a very poor textbook to work with and was trusting it too much.  We were just in the process of doing this again when he demonstrated that you can legitimately say O(n) when you mean O(n^2).<p>Come to find out, he was a math prof, and very much not an algorithms guy.  There are two versions of big-oh notation:  one for algorithmic complexity, and one for accuracy of approximations.  They are exact opposites of each other:  higher numbers are ""better"" for approximation accuracy, at least in the sense they were used in the course.  He was unaware of the former, but both of us were unaware of the latter.<p>Not such a great teacher, no.  Still, the last mistake was an entirely reasonable one.  It's a great example of how even math students need to be on their toes.",1259092656

Most first-time entrepreneurs prefer the opposite because their DNA is to avoid rejection. Their primary focus is to seek validation, from their peers and from their mentors (in time also from their customers). In their mind, rejection is merely an undesirable outcome, which they unfortunately tend to take very personally because they think of it as a failure and a painful reminder to be more prepared the next time around. So they naturally prefer to get their product as perfect as possible.  But rejection is NOT a failure. We don’t learn much from positive feedback. We learn a whole lot more from negative feedback. Entrepreneurs who avoid rejection are essentially depriving themselves of important “learning moments”. It's like learning how to sail, you don't start learning until you start to get wet.

959773,story,,,153,23,ackkchoo,"Tell HN: Four (hopefully) unique and useful start-up tips",,"I've read a lot of posts here on HN about start-up tips and advice. Many are good, but some are too vague to be actionable. Others, while useful, sometimes repeat common themes.<p>I run a start-up that is relatively successful. I am a long time lurker on HN, and wanted to give back to the community. I don’t have a personal blog, and HN is the primary audience I want to share this with, so apologies in advance for the formatting.<p>Although they might sound similar to other posts, hopefully these tips will be unique enough for someone to find useful. I know that they've been worthwhile for me.<p>== 1. Learn to say ""no"" gracefully ==\nA lot of tips stress the importance of saying ""no"", turning down projects that you can’t do, and focusing on your core competencies. This is all great advice. However, in my experience, saying no is not always an easy task. Often times, you’ll be saying ""no"" to an existing partner, or someone with whom you might want to develop a business relationship in the future. It’s important to learn how to say ""no"" gracefully, burning no bridges in the process. By all means, be clear in your response, but don’t be a jerk about it, and leave the option open for future discussion at a time of your choosing.<p>Most online industries have relatively small social circles, and it’s important to be respectful, even if you can’t possibly understand why you might want something that another person is offering. Situations and circumstances change; you might need those connections in the future.<p>== 2. Negotiate everything ==\nGet in the habit of negotiating everything. ""You don’t ask, you don’t get"". Remember that phrase and repeat it to yourself. Revenue shares, commissions, server costs, bandwidth costs, CDN costs, software costs, marketing costs, conference ticket prices and contracts are all negotiable.  At first you might feel weird asking for a discount, but pretty soon you get used to it, and it will become natural. Contrary to what you might assume, most people won’t find your request offensive, and you wont sound like a jerk. You don’t ask, you don’t get.<p>You’ll find it changes your life, not just your business. I negotiate everything now, and it’s probably saved me thousands of dollars this year alone, all for a few minutes of work. Car repairs, hotel prices, restaurant reservation times, and most recently an engagement ring from a high end jeweler that supposedly ""didn’t negotiate"" ;) Remember: you don’t ask, you don’t get.<p>== 3. Don’t obsess over stats ==\nIf you run an online business, it is easy to get caught up in the habit of checking your stats repeatedly throughout the day. Maybe you check your revenue reports every hour. You know how it’s ""supposed"" to look at 11AM on a Friday, and if it isn’t hitting your past targets you get discouraged and distracted, searching for a reason. Maybe your traffic is slightly down from what it was a week ago.<p>The problem with this is three-fold. First, it’s a huge distraction. It takes your attention away from other tasks you could be doing. It distracts your focus from long term, strategic thinking. Second, day to day (or even hour to hour) data is unreliable and unpredictable. There are seasonal trends. There are 500 other factors outside your control.  Third, it accomplishes nothing. Checking your stats isn’t going to change them.<p>Start checking your stats only once a day, at most. That way, you’ll be alerted to any potentially significant changes (i.e. your ecommerce engine is down), but still be able to keep focused on your daily tasks and the big picture, which is going to make more of a difference in the long run.<p>== 4. Make money ==\nOk, so this one is pretty obvious. But it’s shocking how often it is ignored. There are plenty of reasons to justify starting a business. Maybe you want to work for yourself, maybe you like the challenge, or maybe you really want to change the world. But it won’t matter if you aren’t making any money. Trust me.<p>A lot of times you will be faced with hard choices. Should I put this ad up here? Will this feature make my app/site look too commercial? Should I charge? If you don’t have a proven business model, you need to make figuring it out your NUMBER ONE priority.<p>If you’re only getting 1,000 visitors a day, it might seem hard to justify putting up an ad to get what might seem like chump change. But, by doing so, you’ll understand where your money is coming from, and what kind of traffic levels it will take to get you to where you really want to go. Most importantly, you might find that your business model doesn’t really scale, and it will force you to think of a new one. Better now than later. Don’t fool yourself into thinking otherwise, or you’ll just be delaying the inevitable.",1259089884

959768,comment,957958,957958,0,0,chubbard,,,"I think this is a very poignant essay given the place in history we are at.  In 1991 this essay looked like sour grapes over forgotten history, but I'm more interested in what lessons we can learn from previous system.  It's interesting to hear about a time before SQL and relational systems, and how early developers dealt with persistence problems.  The historical account on the controversy of relational technology rings true today given we are struggling with it as well.<p>I heard someone say that when the industry was moving away from big iron to mini-computers and PCs the programs they wrote were considered worthless because they couldn't reuse them on the next platform.  It was the data that was the jewel.  Relational technology embraced separating data from the program to enable reusing data within another program or different hardware.  Prior to that data and program were tied together.  They were fixed and non-portable.  Relational technology came to occupy separation of data and program to facilitate data portability.<p>What's changed is the way in which we write programs.  We aren't tied to machine architecture like we once were.  We use python, ruby or Java which is portable among many platforms.  What was once trash is now treasure because we aren't constrained to one architecture.<p>Does that mean let's go back to flat files?  No.  I think it's combination of the two.  The features like data separation is important.  Network access to data is important.  Query languages are important.  Hierarchical has always been important, but we've probably down played how important.  Scalability and speed are ever more important.<p>What's not as important anymore is relational.  Those other features can be separated.",1259089827

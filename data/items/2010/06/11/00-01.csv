It is way over the top to imply that he's not ""halfways mature"".<p>You will, on the other hand, find plenty of people with real reputations in the industry at stake (unlike yours, which is influenced not one whit by anything you say about disclosure) who will be happy to explain why ""responsible disclosure"" is damaging the industry. It's not even a hard argument to make. The dollar value of a reliable Windows remote is too high to pretend that bona fide researchers are the only people who will find them. Meanwhile, because product managers at large vendors are given the latitude to fix problems on the business' schedule instead of the Internet's, people get to wait 6-18 months for fixes to trivial problems.<p>Personally, without wading into ""responsible"" vs. ""full"" disclosure, I will point out that <i>vulnerability research</i> has made your systems more secure; the manner in which the vulnerabilities were uncovered has very little to do with it. You are more secure now because vendors and customers pay to have software tested before and after shipping it.<p>(My personal beliefs don't often enter the picture; I represent the interests of my clients, almost all of whom would rather fix things on their own schedule).<p>This is an issue that reasonable and responsible people disagree about.",1276217099

You're used to working with stable portfolios with more or less predictable returns, and this might be a bit much for you to take on, so you decide to blow some of your management fee on some really smart consultants who can do the rebalance for you.  They, in turn, have to figure out how to actually execute the plan that they come up with - there are going to be some pretty big orders involved, and if the market gets tipped off that this is going to happen, people are going to start hoarding their shares to drive the price up to screw you.  So they start chopping the order up into much smaller orders and dribbling them out slowly, or looking for baskets of stocks that act like the stocks you really want, or trying to fill from dark pools, all kinds of crazy tricks (and they have to do the same kind of things on the sell side to finance all this).<p>Meanwhile, some even smarter guys at an investment bank just down the road know all these tricks, too, and have come up with a way to algorithmically spot them happening more accurately or more quickly than anyone else.  So they start jumping in front of your trades, not because they want the stock, but because they know you want it and are probably willing to chase a rising bid for a while.  Then all the other algorithms start to notice, and they start doing the same thing.<p>You, the friendly investment manager, are now financing both sides of what really amounts to one of the coolest deathmatches going, a bunch of math and computer geeks playing on your quarter and keeping a penny for the honor of letting you watch them do it.  But you actually don't care, because it wasn't your quarter in the first place, and now that your fund is back in order, you're not going to get sued, and your customers, who had no idea that any of this was going on, and who may not even realize they're your customers, are back to paying 2% fees for (statistically likely) below-market returns.<p>In the past, these kinds of large trades would usually end up splitting the difference, with 'real' sellers earning a bit more than what they would have otherwise settled for and 'real' buyers paying a bit less than their actual ceiling.  But now 'real' buyers end up paying close to their high bid, and 'real' sellers end up earning their low ask, with the bots fighting it out for the very thinly sliced middle territory.<p>In one sense, I do agree that this is an example of a market working perfectly.  Algorithmic traders are exploiting an arbitrage opportunity between mainstream industry practice and cutting edge technical ability, and just like theory would suggest, they're making bank from it.",1276216742

1422258,comment,1407936,1415740,0,0,dkarl,,,"I would still recommend <i>Emotional Intelligence</i>.  I haven't been keeping track of new books, so there may be better or more up-to-date books, but <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> is a good place to start.  It's simple and concrete.  The part about young kids making friends is a good example.  Goleman describes how a kid approaching a group of other children playing observes what the other kids are doing, joins the group quietly, and mimicks what the other kids are doing.  The child is careful to fit into the vibe of the group, and he lets the other kids lead and direct the activity.  Later, after establishing himself in the group, he might assert himself more.<p>That example got my attention because it was counterintuitive.  It sounded like a really passive and loserish way to fit in, the kind of approach that would guarantee you would be looked down on and pushed around.  I had heard that kind of advice before, but to me it always sounded like, ""Look, you're a loser.  Here's the easiest way to get along as a loser in society.""  I wasn't interested in that at all; I wanted to be respected.  But according to Goleman the compliant approach was the approach taken by the <i>most</i> socially successful kids.  The kids who took less harmonious approaches encountered rejection and exclusion, turning many of them into wallflowers or bullies.  Well, being humble and compliant was a much more productive (and less stressful) approach for me, and I could rest assured that I was establishing myself the way a respectable somebody ought to, and my demeanor would not automatically classify me as a pathetic nobody.  Wielding power in a group is a different skill, but it turns out to be founded on sensitive to the group just like cooking is founded on the skill of tasting food.<p>As for #4, <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> drilled into me that empathy was the basis of social understanding, and that we use ourselves as a model of how other people think and feel.  We project our own assumptions and feelings onto other people.  I got pretty good at using that method to see my own shortcomings through other people's eyes.  What I didn't immediately appreciate is that if your view of yourself is warped in <i>any</i> way, including in a negative way, you will misunderstand your social interactions with other people.  For example, if you don't like yourself, you'll never really understand that other people like you.  Hating yourself is a cognitive handicap, and what's worse, it selectively makes you blind to the best things in life.  You're blind to the value you have to other people, blind to the respect other people have for you, and blind to romantic opportunities.  That actually offends people who don't know you (who take your obliviousness as rejection) and frustrates your friends, who do understand.  I thought devaluing myself would give me a safety margin against accidental antisocial behavior, but it actually made my antisocial behavior worse.<p>I was a little late figuring out how I irritated other people with my lack of sensitivity, but I was REALLY late -- I mean decades late -- figuring out that other people like and appreciate me.  I'm still working on it.  Thanks for your contribution ;-)",1276215370

The chassis stiffness and integrity in a BMW is engineered in - try opening the window on a BMW and 'squash' the window opening.  It won't budge.  Try doing the same thing on a japanese or korean car - it will easily bend to your arm.  Same goes for suspension systems.  Many BMWs run a full-subframe aluminium carrier for the suspension systems.  These are lightweight, strong and isolate road bumps and NVH from the main body.  They also last a very long time, unless abused or crash damaged.  None of these features are in cheaper cars even today, even if the cheaper ones are stuffed full of airbags.<p>As for airbags - they run self-test systems each and every time the car starts up, so you can tell if they don't work.  A friend of mine recently crashed a 15 year old Honda - and the airbag worked just fine.  These are seriously engineered active safety systems designed to work decades after being installed - they're not like the battery in a Nintendo.  Every single electronic feature in my 14 year old BMW still works like new, from the sat-nav to the mood lighting, the auto-dim mirrors to the electric memory seats.<p>Also take body integrity - BMWs and mercedes generally use a double-sealing door seal, and a closing latch strong enough to pick up the whole car.  Again, not repeating on new, cheaper models.  They're also hot-dip galvanised when built at the factory, so rust is never a problem unless you have poor treatment or crash damage.<p>I could go on all day.  If you've spent serious time underneath these vehicles, the difference in engineering is night and day with built-to-a-price cheap cars.  Also, take a wander around a salvage yard where some crashed vehicles are.  That will salve your doubts.",1276214488

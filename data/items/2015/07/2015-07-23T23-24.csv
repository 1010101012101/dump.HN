It wasn&#x27;t until I watched this video and read the book that I took the plunge to switch to emacs. It was the fact that with emacs I could have vim _plus_ much more and better functionality. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc</a><p>I&#x27;ll have to write a blog post about it sometime, but basically while I absolutely _love_ the vim &#x27;editing interface&#x27;, that is, not the GUI, but the modal editing, the bindings, motions, objects, relative line numbers, and so on, everything else aside from that, primarily plugins, always felt like ad-hoc hacks to me. I&#x27;ve contributed to a couple of vim plugins so I&#x27;ve seen it first hand, to the point where plugin authors I&#x27;ve worked with have expressed feelings of wanting to switch to emacs to just make things easier. Indeed, some have, such as the vim-airline author [ <a href=""http://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/emacs-as-my-leader-vim-survival-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bling.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/emacs-as-my-leader-vi...</a> ].<p>Whereas plugins in vim oftentimes gave me the impression that they were stopgaps and hacky workarounds to get vim to do something it wasn&#x27;t meant to do, emacs packages feel very natural, comprehensive, and well designed. Just take this article for example. As awesome as vim-fugitive is for vim, I feel that it&#x27;s good _for being a vim plugin_, but it has _nothing_ on the equivalent on emacs: magit. Take a look at it&#x27;s comprehensive documentation: <a href=""http://magit.vc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magit.vc/</a>  Or flycheck&#x27;s [ <a href=""http://www.flycheck.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flycheck.org/</a> ] documentation here [ <a href=""http://www.flycheck.org/manual/latest/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flycheck.org/manual/latest/index.html</a> ]<p>It seems like everyone puts up with everything else about vim just to have the good parts of vim that are generally very poorly emulated by other editors.  The evil package for emacs changed that for me, as it&#x27;s the most faithful vim emulator I&#x27;ve seen. Now I have a superset of vim; the vim that I love in an environment that is _much_ more suitable for my development workflow: magit, error checking, tags, searching, and more.<p>If you&#x27;re just a vim user, you probably don&#x27;t really think about or realize what you&#x27;re missing out on by not using emacs. One of my favorite things about emacs that the book really emphasizes is that it is completely self-documenting. Every function, every key binding, every command, every variable, everything is documented and easy to find. Vim of course has `:help` as well, but emac&#x27;s documentation is on an entirely different level. I can press `C-h k` for example, then press a binding on my keyboard, and it&#x27;ll tell me what command I have it bound to, what that command does, and it&#x27;ll have a link to the source code for that command that opens in emacs with syntax highlighting and everything. Of course I can also do the reverse: find what key a command is bound to; in fact I can search my bindings as I type using helm-descbinds. I can search emacs documentation easily with the `apropos` command and its variants. Oftentimes in vim I generally only looked things up only after I already knew _what_ to look up, whereas in emacs I can easily explore things on my own and figure things out.<p>Emacs has much better extensibility features in general. In vim sometimes I would find something a plugin did that I wanted to work differently, and I pretty much only had two options: 1) file  PR and hope the author agrees with my changes or adds them in optionally or 2) fork the plugin. 2 was out of the question because I didn&#x27;t want the maintenance burden of maintaining a fork, and 1 was too much trouble sometimes for simple modifications or were simply too opinionated to realistically be accepted by the author. So pragmatically I just treated plugins as set-in-stone. With emacs I have much more options at my disposal ranging from advising [ <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Adv...</a> ], hooks, and in the worst case just redefining symbols with emacs lisp.<p>I was and still am hopeful for Neovim, but it&#x27;ll take ages for it to catch up to emacs in terms of robustness and ecosystem, let alone similar feature set of emacs (which is probably a non-goal of neovim anyways). It&#x27;s just an entirely different &#x27;environment&#x27; in the sense of features and packages available to you.<p>I wonder if in the future we could leverage neovim&#x27;s API functionality to have completely true vim bindings/editing within emacs. That would be the absolute best case scenario that I could imagine.<p>That said, I definitely believe that the default emacs bindings are horrible. I at first wanted to try to go cold turkey, 100% emacs, but the editing in emacs is just horrible to someone like me familiar with the speed and precision of vim editing, so I gave in and used evil, which is amazing. That saying about emacs being &quot;a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor&quot; rings very true to my ears, and with evil I have both.",1437694141

As party to the original comment, it didn&#x27;t bring up threads at all. Nor does the issue you linked above, #14875, relate to threads at all. To paraphrase what I remember of the original comment, it was &quot;I stopped using Rust when I got to the Dining Philosophers chapter of the book and found that it taught newcomers to leak memory like crazy, via a bug that has gone unfixed since 2014.&quot; It contained no mention of which bug that was nor where the leaks were, hence the numerous follow-up comments asking for clarification.<p><pre><code>  >  The original comment mentioning this issue was lacking

I can only guess that the original poster edited their comment between the time that you and I read the post, because the original version was quite confrontational.

In other words: we&#x27;ll reach the point at which every barrel of (conventional geological) oil that we produce takes more energy to extract and process than the last. At that point, oil is a dwindling resource.<p>This may or may not mean that the price of oil will go up forever in <i>nominal dollars</i>. It may actually have the reverse effect at times, since it could trigger financial crashes that result in deflation. It may also lead to replacement of oil with other resources (gas, electric, etc.) or shifts away from oil-based transport (electric trains, walking, biking) -- and those could lead to decreases in oil price as well if they occur to enough of an extent.<p>The error in predicting eternal oil inflation is threefold:<p>(1) Assuming that financial cost always reflects objective physical cost -- that there is a 1:1 relationship between thermodynamics and price. Reality: there&#x27;s only a soft relationship subject to the next two factors.<p>(2) Assuming infinite demand inelasticity. Reality: increasing oil price fuels substitution and demand destruction.<p>(3) Forgetting that money (especially fiat money) is itself variable in value. Reality: deflation can cause prices to nominally fall when nothing has actually changed, and inflation can cause the inverse.",1437692932

That&#x27;s putting it lightly.<p>It does have a pipeline BTW.<p>Industry is so different I don&#x27;t know where to start complaining.<p>Xilinx tools are not used for simulation usually because they suck and we generally pay those other tool vendors for their stuff so we might as well use them.<p>Given that newbies don&#x27;t want to pay, maybe Xilinx is the best. I don&#x27;t know much about the free stuff.<p>Looking at previous posts, there is so much behavioral code everywhere. We don&#x27;t write a lot behavioral stuff in VHDL usually. There are higher level languages for behavioral code. Once again, you probably have to pay for those tools so maybe you have no good choices other that behavioral VHDL.<p>IF generic you are stuck with the Xilinx behavioral VHDL, I still would NOT write the behavioral stuff to be a cycle accurate representation of the design. You are just as likely to make a mistake in the behavioral as the RTL. Then when you test the behavioral model against the RTL you will spend half your time debugging the behavioral side. Thinking ahead really helps.<p>The whole approach is wonky from the start. If it were me I would think about the project as a whole and plan ahead. The design is complex in terms of verification. We always assume that every design is complex to verify! If not you wouldn&#x27;t need HW in the first place.<p>There will be lots of tests. How does the test bench run a big suite of tests and report failures? You do not want to look at waveforms unless your test finds a failure. This blog jumps straight to waves!<p>I would start from the whole design first. Figure out the interfaces. Then try to express those interfaces in terms of transactions.<p>In fact, maybe don&#x27;t even start writing VHDL as an expression of the design. Most times in industry we design via documents first. Docs express how the HW will work at a high level and how it will be verified. It breaks the design down into modules. It explains the interfaces between modules. These interfaces become possible points for the verification to look at. The test bench compares the simulated result with a golden reference when it sees a transaction event at the interface and reports a mismatch.<p>The point is create project infrastructure first via planning. Have a big picture view of how it&#x27;s all going to be thoroughly tested automatically each time new code is committed. In industry on top of directed tests, we use constrained randomized tests. We have to determine whether we have covered everything. So we need functional coverage. All this is designed first BEFORE we play around with flops.<p>We can tolerate a lot of craptastic VHDL/Verilog code in industry because at the higher levels it looks neat and tidy and it is all tested vigorously.<p>Basically don&#x27;t follow any stuff from academia because I would bet those guys have never delivered a commercial product. Educational material from tools guys is almost as bad for similar reasons. No one can hold your hand so you have to use your brain.<p>I probably vented too much here.

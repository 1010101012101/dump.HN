Most importantly, great writing and a great fact checking department.<p>The Economist: To the point, global, compact, and great writing and reporting. Plus the student rate isn't that expensive. It combines well with my Washington Post and WSJ daily subs.<p>City Journal: It's Quarterly, but is sort of like a more conservative free market New Yorker. Great articles with a different slant.<p>Atlantic Monthly: I read a lot of the articles  online, and read a lot of Andrew Sullivan, so decided to support the magazine and pick it up in print as well (got 2 years for under $10 online)<p>GQ: For the pictures and ads, although British GQ is better it's just too expensive in the states. Personal interest in style/fashion/design.<p>Forbes: I let expire after they wrote an article titled ""Love Global Warming"" (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1225/038.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/1225/038.html</a>) written by the head of what is more or less an ExxonMobile thinktank.

Mostly. That is, until you want to do something that a CMS should be good at, like have an event calendar, custom form, photo gallery, etc. â€“ which is why WordPress is not focused on being a CMS in the first place. Yet it does such a better job at the basic things like creating new pages, tagging, categorizing, comments, and having custom SEO-friendly URLs out of the box that it edged out other software projects like Drupal and Joomla! whose sole focus is content management.

However, bursting is also a great feature; most loads are bursty (you're caching data and have a cache miss or timeout, you request an admin page which does a lot of computation.)  All time-sharing involves statistical reasoning, even within your own application: all requests might be served from cache, or ten people might issue different cache-miss requests near-simultaneously.  You just reason that under normal circumstances e.g. 80% of your requests will be served from cache, and that determines your typical load.  Short-term bursting means that maybe you can size your machine closer to the mean load, rather than the 2 or 3 sigma load.<p>So, I want _both_ bursting and scale-out :-)<p>The benchmark is fair for measuring CPU bursting performance, but we do need a more comprehensive benchmark suite.",1261603344

And you can slice the productivity along a bunch of different axes - systems designed and built, loc (not a great metric), complexity, features, etc - and the metrics still hold up.<p>That said, this order of magnitude is pretty rare (and it was against the slowest of the programmers) - but if you have a few true superstars, you can expect at least a 4x difference against the average in a group.<p>As far as compensation goes, at my last internet startup there was approximately a 5x difference, once you factor in bonuses.  In the games industry, it was more like 2.5x.<p>For the worst coders, we tended to fire them after a few weeks if they somehow made it past the interview process.

1012849,comment,1012381,1012815,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that there is easily a 10x disparity in output divided by hours worked.  Why did the Etherpads just make 8 figures over the past 3 years, while I made only 6 figures?  They certainly didn't work 100x more.  By the economist's definition, they were easily 100x more productive.<p>I think that there's a more interesting question in the article - why do salaries ""flatten out"" the productivity curve, so that programmers who would easily be making 100x more as startup founders are instead making 50% more, with the balance going to the employer?  After all, if we measure by revenue generated for the employer, I'm in at least the 7 figures, within an order of magnitude.  And I doubt Aaron etc. were making all that much in salary when they were Google employees either.<p>I suspect the answer to this has to do with risk allocation.  Because technology markets tend to be winner-take-all, there's a lot of variance in productivity that's <i>not</i> the result of the coder's actions.  In other words, it comes down to luck, being in the right market with the right product.  You can work hard at the wrong thing and still produce nothing of value, despite being smart and dedicated.<p>When you sign on as an employee, your employer agrees to take on the risk that you'll work hard and still nothing will come of it.  And in return, they get nearly all of the upside if your hard work <i>does</i> result in something great.<p>I suspect that the 10x more productive figure is a result of sample bias: when you look at what people <i>have done</i>, there are some folks whose projects were 10x more useful than what other people have done.  All the people who worked equally hard and produced equally large amounts of code are lumped into the ""not productive"" category, because in hindsight, their projects weren't all that useful.  If you try to predict, a priori, who the 10x coders are, I bet you'll have a much harder time.  If you don't, you have a sterling future ahead of you as a venture capitalist.",1261602197

But the latest incarnation has survived multiple years, despite large incentive for a public break. It's been hard enough to break that what has been done has been kept private, for commercial reasons. Like it or not, it's a success story.<p>DirecTV had an active cracking community 7 years ago. Then they contracted a famous cryptography team to develop what appears to be a white-box crypto scheme implemented directly in hardware gates. Nobody has been able to do anything with it since. It's a major success story. What was there in 1999 wasn't so much a ""community"" as a cottage industry, and now it's dead.<p>BD+ actually has been broken. Title. By. Title. Even if that trend continues for the next several years, it's still a win for Blu-Ray, because SlySoft hasn't gotten a crack out within opening week yet, and they have to dedicate a team to refreshing their product at the whim of the publishers.<p>I don't have a moral concern about DRM. I'd rather use unencumbered CDs. Sure, I'd also rather not pay for satellite TV. But as a CS problem, it's really interesting. The things that people say make it ""impossible"" actually make it Hard. Hard problems are fun, and we learn from them.",1221285229

302982,comment,302770,302838,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I agree.  You've got only 8 couples over only 10 nights.  That's short and a small sample.  Also there's no detail on what they did when they slept apart.  For example, perhaps the men went off slept in a 5 star hotel and pampered themselves.<p>Also, this news is from 2006.  But it gets worse.  If you go find the paper you'll find this abstract:<p>""Introduction: So far only a few studies (e. g. Meadows et al 2005) have focused on the interrelationship between bedpartners and its effect on sleep and sleep quality. Previous studies were either restricted to women's perceptions and experiences of sleep (Hislop et al 2003) or to interaction between parents and children.
Method: The current investigation examined how sleep and sleep quality is influenced by the presence and absence of the bedpartner over a period of four weeks. Couples were young unmarried students (mean age: 25; range: 22 - 26) with no children and no history of sleep disturbances. All subjects filled in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a standardized sleep anamnesis inventory as well as the MEQ- questionnaire to evaluate morning- or evening- chronotypes. Sleep-wake patterns were continuously monitored by wrist-worn actigraphs and all subjects completed a sleep diary including a standardized self-rating scale for subjective sleep and awakening quality every morning. During the investigation period subjects were instructed to spend at least 10 nights together and 10 separately.
Results: Preliminary results from three couples (out of 10) show a significant reduction of subjective sleep and awakening quality in the co-sleeping condition as compared to the nights slept alone. This tendency was observed in females as well as in males. Co-sleeping also reduced objective (calculated by actigraphs) and subjective sleep efficiency (sleep log data) with a more pronounced reduction in females. When sleeping alone women have more sleep epochs associated with movements than men. In nights spent together in both females and males the mean activity score increased but the changes were not significant.
Discussion: The current investigation examines both gender differences during sleep/wakefulness and the physiological and psychological impact each partner has on the other during sleep.""<p>Key phrase: Preliminary results from three couples (out of 10) show a significant reduction of subjective sleep and awakening quality in the co-sleeping condition as compared to the nights slept alone.<p>So this is based on just three couples in fact.",1221284976

I'd pay for them if I could get them) but from my experience, as soon as a show is uploaded it has a huge seeder/leecher ratio, but several days afterwards, that number appears is always considerably less.<p>For some anecdotal evidence, one TV show I was watching in particular had stopped being shown in Aus but within hours of it being ""released"" online I was seeing up to 30k seeders at times, yet several days later that number had dropped considerably down to 3k.<p>I just quickly typed Spore into mininova and looked at the top result by seeders and it shows the downloads as over 144k just off mininova alone, although no doubt a few of these would be incomplete, but given mininova's ""market share"" compared to say the rest of the torrent sharing community, the figure in the article comes across as incredibly low still.",1221284655
302978,comment,302934,302934,0,0,halo,,,"I've been thinking about it lately and I've decided the problem isn't inherently DRM itself. The problem is that when companies use DRM without giving back and, in particular, use horrible invasive DRM that is a pain for the genuine customer.<p>Case in point: Steam. Steam is basically one big DRM wrapper that also prevents resale. However, one key difference is that it offers multiple advantages to users in the form of unlimited redownloads, community features, not requiring a CD, no DRM driver ugliness, banning hackers in multiplayer games, works as a decent launcher and also has an extremely convenient online marketplace. The end result is that it has been given a much warmer reception than the typical DRM scheme - people are willing to give up some of their rights in exchange for the added convenience which is a much fairer trade. I'm not saying Steam is perfect but it seems like the direction companies like EA should be going.",1221284509

The vast majority of its content is also available on CD/DVD.<p>I don't keep up with DirecTV, but I know there was at some point an active cracking community; while BD+ is still unbroken, AACS fell. These systems have been almost entirely deployed in embedded systems, which clearly makes them harder to crack. Still, the xbox360 and the wii have been cracked (can be modded).<p>I do not think DRM has a good track record and I think it is fundamentally wrongheaded. I don't find the current  solutions to DRM that interesting -- from what I understand they just lock down as much as possible (from TCM to HDCP). However, if/when Sun's DReaM stops being a pipe-DReaM, I'll definitely pay attention.",1221284473

I was suggesting spreading ""the truth"" as you asserted it.  I suggested that we demand a conclusive test of McCain's physical abilities and spread the word.  If he actually can type in a significant way and yet doesn't read e-mail, Obama's charge gets greater distribution.<p>If, on the other hand, he can't type and/or does use e-mail, the demand and publicity may have a political downside.  But, that's shouldn't bother you because you're certain that you're correct.<p>> McCain didn't say he couldn't use his hands -- you did.<p>Except that I didn't.  As one can see above, I wrote that he can't do certain things and nothing has contradicted that.  (See the Forbes article quoted below.)<p>We've now seen that the argument using the handwriting evidence was wrong - McCain does have trouble typing.  It was a dumb argument anyway - a handwriting sample doesn't prove that he can write for a significant period of time.<p>However, you're in good company.  Obama's ad was wrong - McCain does use e-mail.  He surfs the web.  He just doesn't type lengthy responses - he dictates instead, because his hands don't work very well.<p>Do you really want to argue that typing >30WPM for more than 10 minutes is a necessary requirement for the presidency?",1221282866

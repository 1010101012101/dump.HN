Additionally, it usually means you get to follow along in the development process, maybe even provide input or feedback.

No additional power supply is necessary, and it will not interfere with normal use of your hardware
You can readily switch from laser to print/mill mode, use your existing software (Slic3r, Skeinforge, etc), and with no tools the laser can be removed in about 2 minutes
Endurance L-CHEAPO can cut paper and wood up to 3/16ths of an inch, and can engrave most non-metallic materials<p>Easy to Use and Open Source<p>No special software or hardware required â€“ not even a power supply! All you need is to mount the laser, create a special extrusion profile on your standard software and get to work. Video in action available here: http://endurancerobots.com/products/laser-cutters-accessory/video-in-action/

After vastly reducing the weight, even more so because we don&#x27;t need to carry as much fuel, we don&#x27;t need tracks, because an 8 wheel variant gives sufficient traction.<p>Oh, and since our new highly mobile and effective vehicle now costs a tenth as much, all the other expensive and slow vehicles taking on other roles in the army can be deprecated.<p>In fact, let&#x27;s design a variant that carries fuel. In this way, instead of having 50 tanks advancing 100km per day, we can have 500 of our new vehicles advancing 500km per day, with the same firepower and effective armor, completely overwhelming any opposition. Why has nobody figured this out before?<p>OK, so, after we&#x27;ve taken the base assumption and followed the chain to its logical conclusion without error... we have nonsense.

countries. Federal, state, municipal, transit and ministerial among others
(there are certainly more but this are the ones that you encounter for the
most part.). The general view varies wildly between each different level.<p>Federal police: They are generally considered to be highly educated individuals
so they have a certain amount of respect among civilians, most people feel
comfortable around them and will trust them in case of an emergency.<p>State police: They are kind of iffy, particularly in my state you generally
don&#x27;t get to see ordinary state officers patrolling the city, but the
state police has a famed SWAT team that is staked out at the state border 24/7
and will sometimes be seen patrolling around the city at night. Even though
it has been a couple of years, they still have this terrible reputation
that where ever they go something (not nice) is probably going to go down.
A few years back they were always early whenever large shootout broke out,
so now people are wary of them.<p>Municipal police: They are generally viewed as lazy uneducated people, and
have a certain fame of being rude, corrupt (although, they aren&#x27;t particularly corrupt),
and unhelpful which is certainly warranted. Most people don&#x27;t feel 
comfortable calling them.<p>Transit police: They are known for preying on the most vulnerable in an attempt
to make some quick bucks, some are quite cheeky, most are rather subtle.<p>Ministerial police: They have a reputation of rampant corruption, and depending
on where you lie on the socio-economic ladder, you are either not scared at all of 
them or you are absolutely terrified about having to deal with them.<p>YMMV.",1439462015

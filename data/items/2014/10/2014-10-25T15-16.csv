Israeli national sport is to point out Israeliness/jewishness (two completely different things, IMHO) of anything that smells of success. We love to do this when it&#x27;s positive, we try to hide it when it&#x27;s not. Like in this case. 
My first suspicion was that it was an Israeli, not because I saw the name and suspected. I had no clue. Just a suspicion which was verified. 
My reasons are probably my own experience in Hi Tech in Israel and the abundance of indian programmers in many of our own local companies.<p>PS-0
And don&#x27;t get me started on how racist the jewish diaspora is, or Israelis, in general. Towards black, arabs, other jews etc. It&#x27;s a stinking pile of self-hatred and racism.<p>PS-1

8508525,comment,8505665,8507805,0,0,williamstein,,,"If I had resources similar to commercial math software companies (so I could hire hundreds of professional engineers), I would still do a mix of writing new code from scratch and using existing libraries.  What would change is the mix.   Also, I would identify components of Sage of questionable quality/design, and put substantial resources into improving them (thus giving back to their communities).   For example, Jakob Kroeker has been frequently posting on the Sage development mailing list about how he was -- out of interest -- systematically auditing code in Singular, and he found some serious bugs.  Unfortunately, he is about to leave mathematics (since he&#x27;s not going to get supported doing auditing?), but if I had more resources, I  could hire him fulltime to systematically auditing open source mathematical software.  It&#x27;s a waste that such people <i>systematically</i> slip through the cracks, people who are passionate about auditing math software source code.  The minute they start doing some of the things we really, really need, they vanish due to lack of money.

8508509,comment,8504931,8508246,0,0,navr,,,"there are too many stories. On 23rd of Dec 1999. I went for an interview with XXX, an Enron like looser company (btw, this is what happened in Enron, a distilled hitchhiker guide to enronization of NA: a company A sold assets to company B. Company A continued to use those assets). This was my second or third coming to their establishments (first time I visited them they were porting from Ingres to Oracle; on my second visit (different) they informed me they are porting from Oracle to - Ingres). So here I am on 23rd of Dec. 1999. I was greeted by a - think John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever - a &quot;project manager&quot; (btw &quot;project manager&quot;, &quot;business analyst&quot; and similar stupidities are all The Tools of Corruption of Enormous Proportions. Project Management exists...in projects like NASA Space Shuttle etc. Or Hadron Colider and similar. But to create a &quot;project&quot; around 4 (four) lines of Perl code?? That is plain stupidity (I used Perl intentionally to express my disgust with all of that nonsense which cost NA economies trillions and trillions of dollars, together with so called &quot;HR departments&quot;, &quot;job agencies&quot; and similar stupidities).
Back to our Travoilta PM. The guy had an Oracle book besides him (!it takes a disco dancer to at least come close to something that has any connection to Oracle whatsoever. All other idiots who declined my application for Oracle jobs, they opted for so called &quot;behavioural&quot; interviews (these are interviews where milk can be white or black, depending on the wish of the Travolta, pardon &quot;interviewer&quot;). Of course Travolta didn&#x27;t understand a word I was saying. I was looking those huge establishments with 1000s of cubicles and at that moment I knew one thing with 100% certainty: this is going down sharply very soon. I knew something (but not enough, and not enough time to learn more) about short selling. I remember thinking: this Travolta company&#x27;s stock is $125 and it must go to $60 no question about it. I had 300,000 at the time. Long story short: the stock went down not to $60, not even to $6, but TO F. 6 CENTS (!). From $125 to 6 cents. And I was a prime witness and I due to trading inexperience did nothing. I mean how many stock analysts could have such opportunity to observe a praised (top 3 companies in the field) company from inside and spot a huge technical signal: SELL, SELL, SELL.",1414252136

I&#x27;m also a pretty experienced lifter (Been lifting for 9 years, can DL 3x my bodyweight, Squat 2.5x bodyweight, BP 1.6x) but I&#x27;m always looking for the bare minimum to improve. If that happened to be a 7 minute workout, that&#x27;s what I would do. I think it&#x27;s incredibly motivating to use your time really effectively. I spend probably about 1/4 to 1/2 the time in the gym as anyone else there with comparable fitness levels because I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on training methods and have tried tons of different programs and permutations to find the ones that are most effective for me.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that the biggest problem with this is that there are &quot;no discernible goals&quot; associated with this &quot;scientific&quot; workout.

8508473,comment,8498782,8498782,0,0,wetfossils,,,"I love BNW. It is such an magnified representation of the post-war world. Like all literature, it&#x27;s a metaphore, not to be taken too literally as a prophecy--although it was clearly a possibility in Huxley&#x27;s mind. BNW may never be, but we&#x27;re already there, in many ways. We are not clones, but we are expected to specialize, to identify with roles that aim to produce value, get paid, buy things, entertain ourselves, to feed the system and forget about it. It is a really seducing utopia--compared to the more openly overt dystopia of 1984, at least. Huxley, I believe, saw it coming and wanted to warn us about its costs and limitations.<p>People said about Aldous Huxley that he could have an in-depth conversation about virtually any subject. As a well read person, he was aware the current developments at the time in the fields of psychology, management and life sciences--to name a few. It is no surprise that he came to speculate about the rise of advertisement and human resources management, which turned psychology on its head by applying it as a tool to generate and maintain a compliant supply of consumers and producers before anything else. His utopia is one where life is ruled by convenience, from the crib to the death. The more alarmist speculations of managed births and intitutionalized overmedication are simply logical extensions of this philosophy. It may be too easy to just go along with it without asking ourselves if life shouldn&#x27;t be about something else than finding purpose through our given social functions. There&#x27;s something deeply tragic about BNW, which isn&#x27;t so unfamilar and requires us to take a step back from such ideals. The questions it raises are terribly current to us.<p>BNW is far from perfect, but the last century showed us that Huxley was right. Most of us want to love their servitude, and we&#x27;re willing to work pretty hard in order to do so. The spectre of 1984, of surveillance and repression, is mainly reserved for those who stray away from what&#x27;s expected of us. It stands as a menace to keep us in check. When people occupy the streets or participate in activity that undermine the accepted order, only then does it show its ugly head. In a way, 1984 and BNW are complements to each other.",1414251472

I remember doing the same math (e.g. 10k students x $200 each = $2M!...and in only 6 months!). I was floored that these instructors were making so much money. In hindsight, I realize that I made 3 key mistakes in my assumptions:<p>1. Even if it&#x27;s a paid course, that doesn&#x27;t mean that all students paid money. Udemy instructors have the ability to give out free coupons to help in marketing their courses. Since it&#x27;s in Udemy&#x27;s best interest to boost their displayed course enrollment numbers, signing up a free account and &#x27;purchasing&#x27; a course for free is really easy. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some instructors use a script to automate this process and enroll thousands of fake students.<p>2. Even if people do pay, almost no one pays full price (and the price you see may not have been the price at launch). Udemy gives frequent and deep discounts (&quot;50% off all courses for Udemy&#x27;s 4th birthday!&quot;, &quot;70% off because summer&#x27;s out and the school year ended!&quot;, &quot;90% off select courses just because it&#x27;s October!&quot;). Many Udemy users are &#x27;course collectors&#x27; - they&#x27;ll purchase a bunch of courses at once when it&#x27;s on discount, in case they may want to learn those skills in the future.<p>3. Udemy gets a bigger cut than you think. While instructors keep 100% of revenue from customers they bring to Udemy, the majority of your students will be Udemy users you don&#x27;t know. For these purchases, instructors receive 25% or 50% of the purchase price (depending on whether Udemy did any marketing), with an additional discount if the course was purchased on a mobile device.<p>Don&#x27;t build a course to &#x27;get rich quick&#x27; - do it only if you actually like teaching.",1414250386

There&#x27;s also syntax for using @Inject annotations inline in the constructor to provide more flexibility.

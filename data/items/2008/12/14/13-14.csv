397363,comment,396696,396696,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"This looks like a simple solution for me. I have a TrueCrypt volume that I keep account/password info in. I've been lazy and use email or ftp to get/send copies of it, so any given copy could have stale info in it. Yeah, I could rsync the file, but like I said, I'm lazy and didn't feel like configuring rsync between Windows XP and Linux. This looks like a good solution for me. Thanks!",1229263117

The reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). [from Wikipedia]. ADCS7476 (datasheet), ADCS7477, and ADCS7478 are monolithic CMOS 12-, 10- and 8-bit analog-to-digital converters.",1229263115

It's great at exposing a lot of sales techniques, but I had this weird feeling while reading it that it could be used as an instruction manual. Haven't read his new one yet, but it looks like an instruction manual. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Scientifically-Proven-Ways-Persuasive/dp/1416570969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Scientifically-Proven-Ways-Persuas...</a>",1229261715

It's just as illegal (or ought to be) if the work they've infringed is published under a free software license or a non-free license. If Cisco didn't like the terms of the GPL, they were free not to use GPL'ed software.<p>For a business to sell products containing GPL'd software without complying with the license is as bad as a business making counterfeit DVDs and selling them on street corners; in both cases it is serial copyright infringement for profit.<p>(IANAL, but maybe the GPL could be changed so that users have the choice of complying with the usual terms or paying the FSF $1000 per copy; then any infringers would be liable for some multiple of that amount per infringing copy).",1229261651

It may be inconvenient to navigate to a web page to input this information, but that's a problem that can be solved by writing an app for less than $45.  I don't even know Objective-C, but I bet I could do it in a few hours.<p>For bonus points, there could be a generic ""web form"" application that scrapes web forms and allows easy POST access to them with a native GUI.<p>I almost want to do this, but I don't have Apple's permission.  Too bad.",1229261435

Optimistically, this should be working again after ghc 6.10.2, which also targets a haddock fix.<p>Even without working haddock though, the api should be better documented in the source. If haddock suddenly started working there still would be a lot of undocumented functions.",1229260432

How can an email client be written that doesn't handle these basic headers?  It suggests the RFCs weren't read.",1229260218

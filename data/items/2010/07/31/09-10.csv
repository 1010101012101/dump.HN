And the competitors can't catch up because they don't know how Intel does its magic.<p>By contrast, Reddit looks like something that was built in a couple of days by two bored college students. I like Reddit, but let's face it, they're not pushing technology anywhere. They don't have to deal with quantum effects, current leakage, and that kind of stuff. They just run a few servers, and they don't have a business plan that can compare to Intel's. So, what exact point are you trying to make?",1280567804

Just take the cash and go build something real, and let people with a large pillow of capital take the risk.<p>My point is this: Andy Grove and the founders of Intel were not successful because they built ""something people want"". They were successful because they created something people did eventually want, because they made wise decisions at the right time, and because their skillsets made them irreplaceable almost. If you want to build an empire, then create something the world will need in the future, make sure you're the only one who knows how to do it, and capitalize on your knowledge while the rest of the world is catching up.

I live few miles away from Collin Creek, and the author is giving the most accurate picture possible. It is a dead mall, and there are many reasons for it including accessibility from the highway (US-75), shift of the center of wealth to mostly West and North of Plano, away from Collin Creek area. All in all DFW is over-saturated with malls but they are still building malls because of the North-ward expansion near Plano area. Trust me a movie theater is not going to save this mall.<p>For now the Mall is collecting some checks from the City and Management which claim to protect jobs and sales tax base.

However they are not comparable to Heartbleed or this SChannel overflow in severity at all:<p>(1) They require you to have a pre-recorded SSL session you&#x27;re trying to crack. Random script kiddies won&#x27;t find it useful.<p>(2) They require sending a lot of traffic to the server to try and break that single recording (you can get caught quite easily!)<p>(3) They don&#x27;t reveal the private key, only per connection premaster secrets (if I understood correctly).<p>Basically, the first attack was possible because JSSE returned &quot;internal server error&quot; when faced with a particular kind of malformed packet instead of &quot;bad padding&quot; - this binary yes/no thing was enough to allow the attacker to divine some internal state and with enough queries retrieve the PMS. The second was a similar trick but instead of observing a different error code, it exploited the fact that internally the code was throwing an exception and this made a difference of some microseconds in the response. Over a LAN, with enough queries, that was enough to eventually reveal the PMS. However when running over a much noisier environment like the internet, number of queries required goes up quite a bit. I believe, they did not test that.<p>As I said before, they were both fixed, and I think Rich now agrees with me that they were fixed. There may be others that would require compiler support or hand coding of assembly to fix. Certainly there&#x27;s nothing in the design of Java or the JVM that makes that impossible however.

The fact of the matter is that Spotify is making boatloads of cash off the works of artists, and they are not paying out enough to those artists.<p>Straight from the spotify website [1], they say the average revenue from a stream to a rights holder is between $0.006 and $0.0084.  The poverty line is $23,283.  That means an artist needs 3,326,142 plays in a year to just hit that line.

They&#x27;re still malls though.<p>When I first moved here in 2005, the bigger of the two malls in town (Madison Square Mall) had just received a major renovation and was bustling. A few years later (I think this was about 2007) they announced this new major construction project called Bridge Street[0]. It was just about two miles away from Madison Square.<p>It was essentially an outdoor mall, with all the same stores you would expect to find in any mall. Just outside. Within the last six years, pretty much all the stores that were at Madison Square Mall have relocated to Bridge Street. In fact, Bridge Street just underwent a big expansion so that one of the department stores at Madison Square could move in.<p>These days, everyone goes to Bridge Street, and Madison Square Mall is mostly empty except for check cashing places, blacklight golf places, and, strangely, a Sears that just hasn&#x27;t moved yet - which is pretty much the only reason I even go to Madison Square any more at all. There may be one other department store there hanging on too. But other than that it&#x27;s mostly empty. The escalators were even turned off when I went in there a few weeks ago.<p>Madison Square Mall was built in the mid 80s, and started going down hill after about 20 years. The other mall in town was built in the late 90s and is still doing &quot;mostly okay&quot; but you can tell Bridge Street hurt them some too. So I figure it&#x27;s only a matter of time before Bridge Street starts to go down hill and all those same stores move on to whatever the next trend in shopping is.<p>And, just like Madison Square, leaving a blighted landscape of mostly or completely abandoned buildings in their wake.<p>They&#x27;re still building malls.

Rigorous proofs do much more than simply eliminate the possibility of mistakes (though they do that too); they make the argument accessible to a wider mathematically literate audience who may not be familiar with techniques which are standard in the author&#x27;s field. I know a not-inconsiderable amount of graduate-level probability and a bit of stat phys and yet still this paper is not a trivial read.

Would we all just collectively flip out or something?<p>For that matter, what happens if an ordinary Culture person decides to take a trip to some foreign capitalist society? Presumably the trip would have to be approved by Contact or something, which seems kind of ominous by itself. Where would they get money to go do touristy things in that society? Does the culture make money in that society somehow, and give anybody who wants to visit an unlimited pile of it? Or is it limited somehow?<p>Exactly what makes the Mind AIs free from all of the mental issues and personality flaws that have caused Human-led societies so many issues? Especially when we see that the human-level drones seem to have a rather ordinary level of positive and negative personality traits.<p>Exactly how does this society go about deciding which Minds decide what? Do the Minds vote or something? If so, how is it decided which Minds get a vote? Which Minds decide when and how to produce more Minds, and how to train/educate them? Essentially, what is the structure of the Mind-government?

Many people are willing to use a couple different free services, but probably not piecemeal paid services to get the same experience. So, unlike piracy, Spotify has to have a catalog that makes most users think &quot;yeah, they have all the music I want to listen to&quot;. Especially as a top artist, Taylor Swift has a lot of power in this relationship, because of the impetus that Spotify has to provide a &quot;full&quot; catalog.<p>Hopefully, this model continues, and artists like Taylor Swift continue to push back. The system of 20 years ago had too little power in the artists, too much power in the distribution, and too little choice for consumers. I like that the middleman / channel delivery is now the one who has to provide value, and the artists can take their music elsewhere. It gives artists power, allows competition in distribution, and provides more consumer choice.

If you&#x27;re a sizable investor in the company, obviously that&#x27;s a different context.<p>In the Fortune 500, it&#x27;s a prestige gig as much as anything. For many smaller companies, agreeing to be on the board while not being a large investor, is almost akin to being involved in a local govt board of economic development for a town or county - it&#x27;s sometimes done as a favor, out of quasi-charity to help out, and or you know some of the people involved and want to see the company succeed.<p>It can also be a great way to make more connections in business; one board membership refers to the next - you can kind of move up an economic chain that way if you go on a successful ride-along. People like to be associated with / involved with successful enterprises.<p>The historical reason for connected board control, is at least two fold: enabling trusted parties to oust the CEO without needing to hold a large vote by shareholders (not an easy thing to do now, and more difficult a century ago); and enabling direct major shareholder control without requiring a wider shareholder vote (if you own 10,000 shares of Walmart along with a million other investors, while technically those total shares have the same voting value net as the hedge fund that owns 5% of the company - the 5% entity wants a lot of influence due to the concentrated stake). Board control also enables rapid action in cases of fraud or abuse by the top executive/s, in which case time may be critical - that is, you don&#x27;t want to wait months for a full shareholder vote.<p>Also, who do you leave legal authority to, when it comes to deciding the replacement for a CEO that has decided to retire or quit (or dies, or whatever)? Certainly shareholders as a whole have legal control, but it&#x27;s not very practical to have thousands of shareholders trying to figure out who gets to be the next CEO (most of those shareholders will have absolutely no idea who would make a good candidate, or where to start, having typically zero direct involvement in understand the business top to bottom, and most shareholders will have no experience running a serious business).

A breakthrough in the quality of the operational engine significantly impacts the experience of doing higher-level work, so if someone finds a better way to run map/reduce jobs, it&#x27;s a win for everyone. Shipping jars instead of docker containers, and not having snapshots are serious drawbacks in the existing map/reduce infrastructure that significantly impact users in negative ways.<p>Secondly, an easier way to specify map/reduce jobs (via a simple web server that exposes API endpoints to do data grouping, mapping, and reduction) is a dramatically simpler, more composable way to expose map/reduce jobs. Building higher level infrastructure on top of this abstraction is an order of magnitude easier than doing it on top of Hadoop, so it could be a better underlying platform for the generalization work being done in the community.",1415739704

9634344,comment,9632751,9632751,0,0,chippy,,,"The process outlined in the article echoes the theory that capitalism always will take over and repurpose any opposition to it, and it echoes some of the ideas from the Situationists Society of the Spectacle.<p>The &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; is an awful term, but it basically means a consumerist society. A consumerist society is one where having the appearance of something is more important than the actual something.<p>The process is one from: being to having to appearing. For example being very wealthy (an upper class landed gentry family) to having wealth (middle class earning money) to appearing to have wealth (people wearing the same clothes as rich people, bling).<p>I&#x27;m thinking the same process is in effect with subcultures.\nThe creators are the ones who are cool (being cool) - the fanatics are the ones who have cool (they have good taste, have the things the creators produce) and the masses afterwards buy the appearance of cool (the image of what is cool is able to be bought, authenticity is less important).<p>Another example: hippys being all hippy and being all free and socialist, later on other hippies having the music and then later on everyone else buying jeans to look like a hippy.<p>This leads me to thinking of today, and The Hipster. Is being a hipster about buying things, or appearing to have things? Is it mass marketable? (beards, haircuts, clothes) Is it a sub culture? Does it have any defining principles?",1433084291

I understand that the Hola service is not well executed in the slightest and should most likely be avoided if you do not want your net connection shared, but this is going way over the top IMHO.<p>The FAQ page had always mentioned that resources were shared unless you paid for the premium service. Yes, it could have been a lot clearer, but they have never out right denied it as many people seem to be making out.<p>People complained that their FAQ and information pages were not up to scratch to explain the details behind their network. So they update it with more information and now people complain that they updated it? Damned if they do, damned if they don&#x27;t.<p>The service they provide is obviously targeted at non-technical users so it is completely understandable why they wouldn&#x27;t be mentioning the technical details. This scares and baffles the users. If they were purposely deceiving the users with flat out lies then that wold be another thing but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here.<p>The exploits are serious and extremely stupid in the way they had developed launching the binaries and people should be made aware.

9634321,comment,9633251,9633251,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Throughput is not really mentioned here, which is the key bottleneck I think.<p>Nobody really has huge issues parking their bike at home. Humans are sufficiently spread out around a city, and so bike density is similar to human density, which is not that bad.<p>The problem areas for storage solutions for bikes is at areas with very high density. Here in the Netherlands that&#x27;s the train stations. At the Central Station of big cities like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, hundreds of thousands of people pass every day, relatively small areas. Many of those arrive or leave by bike. Storing those bikes is tricky, not only because of space concerns, but also because the vast majority of people (probably 80%) arrive/leave during two periods of about 90 minutes of peek travel time in the morning and evening.<p>In other words at any one point during those periods, you have hundreds of people storing or retrieving their bicycle at the same time.<p>That is totally incompatible it seems with this device, which retrieves at most 2 bikes or so per minute. A person has to walk up, enter his card, his password, then the device has to do some stuff, then he has to retrieve it from the device, walk away.<p>Compare storing your bicycle at a train station for example with buying train tickets. At the Central Station you&#x27;ll easily find dozens and dozens of machines to buy a ticket, and lots of booths to do so as well, and still you see rows of people at peek times. Even after we&#x27;ve had subscription based tickets for decades (e.g. take any train and pay x per year) and card based systems (if the balance on your card drops below $10 it can get automatically refilled. Just swipe your card to enter the train) for years which means most travellers don&#x27;t even need to purchase a ticket.<p>So you&#x27;d need quite a lot of these machines and I don&#x27;t really see how that&#x27;d make economic sense. We&#x27;ve had a lot of good experiences with manual underground, cheap, low-maintenance facilities now that are a better alternative. And for low-throughput areas, storage of bicycles isn&#x27;t a very big issue, meaning the economics (premium price, no doubt) make even less sense when there are plenty of free storage opportunities (on the street).<p>For certain bikes it makes sense (those costing $10k). But that&#x27;s not the norm in countries with high per-capita rates of bikes. I and everyone I know have had bikes costing at most 200, I tend to buy them for 80 or so second hand with 20 of annual maintenance. I can store it infront of my house just fine, it&#x27;s never a problem. The rate of theft means it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one / insure the bike for a fraction of its cost, than to pay $100+ a year for storage like this (and even that rate is unlikely to be profitable for this facility). And at the central station where it is hard to park a bike without adequate facilities, retrieval would be too slow, and manual underground facilities are fine.",1433083740

Sorry, but I want to download those free previews on www.guidestar.org, and find out who is on the BOD, and who is making the most money in the 501c3.  If I can&#x27;t find the detailed financials; I don&#x27;t donate.<p>Why would a non-profit register in Delware:<p>&quot;One advantage provided to corporations under the DGCL is flexibility in internal structure. Unlike some states such as New York, the DGCL requires a corporation to have only one director. A nonprofit corporation in Delaware must have members, but directors can serve as the only members. Unlike California, there is no requirement for a majority disinterested board. Finally, Delaware does not require the naming of corporate officers.<p>Delaware also generally applies less cumbersome regulation to the formation and operation of nonprofit corporations than some other states. Unlike New York, which requires in certain circumstances the approval of various state agencies prior to the formation of a nonprofit, an individual can form a Delaware nonprofit corporation simply by filing a certificate of incorporation. Delaware also does not require nonprofit corporations formed under Delaware law to register with its Attorney General’s office or file annual separate financial reports to the state (though if the nonprofit operates in Delaware, it may be required to file a copy of its federal Form 990 with the Delaware Attorney General). Finally, unlike some states, Delaware does not require any state government approvals for nonprofit corporate changes such as amendments to the certificate of incorporation, mergers, and dissolutions.&quot;<p>Looking at the Federal From 990 is important--IMHO.  The public shouldn&#x27;t have to pay to see that informantion.  I don&#x27;t know if couchsurfing even filed 990&#x27;s?  A disinterested board is important--for any non-profit--IMHO. Registering with the attorney generals office is important--IMHO. My point is if you are a San Francisco non-profit register in California.

There are open-source solutions for that in Linux that integrate into LVM and do that pretty much without any other interaction by the user. bcache comes to mind but there were a few others as well.",1433081399

It also seems that the general consensus among psychologists and psychiatrists is that the current system damages people and does nothing to achieve its alleged aims.

It&#x27;s not confusion of social signals per say, rather it&#x27;s the amplification of these signals that causes anxiety. It&#x27;s the over analyzing and excessive processing the brain does that causes anxiety.<p>From my experience, MDMA eases the mind, and fills it with empathy, love and connectedness to others (or release the molecules necessary for this). Under this state, it&#x27;s not hard to see how one could temporarily break free of their &#x27;normal anxious&#x27; state.",1433080953

That's something I didn't make clear enough in the diagram, and a 2nd misconception I had until a month ago too :).<p>Yes, exactly as you say, the total energy is the same but the orientation and amplitude of the field differs. I think the trouble is showing another dimension without resorting to the y-axis which is too easily confused with a path to travel (especially a sine wave, which is usually shown in the context of ""height on a circle"" or somesuch).<p>Red and blue colors may be better -- bright red to bright blue, showing which way the field is pointing at that time. Black and white are too easily confused with dim and bright (and a light wave never goes ""off"").<p>The original diagrams were made years ago and I should update the colors.

2487936,comment,2486714,2487705,1,0,fryguy,,,"Well there is a fundamental difference between the two. The light bulb was invented, was lightning was discovered. It already existed, and was merely discovered. It was discovered that there are are infinite primes. It was discovered that f'(x) = 2x when f(x) = x^2. It was discovered that when p is prime, (a * x) === b mod p, x is unique mod p (unless a=0, or something else). Eventually you get to things like cryptography where you can apply some simple things that were discovered into a process, and come up with encryption.<p>If you go back to mathematics and consider (Newton's method)[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons_method</a>], that seems like it might have been invented, but it's derived from a series of discoveries, and hence is considered a discovery rather than an invention. If you used the Newton-Rhapson method to calculate the zero of a function in code somewhere, you should feel safe that it's not protected by a patent (not to mention it was discovered ages ago).<p>Since computer science is applied mathematics, and mathematics are discovered rather than invented, it makes sense that it should be protected as well. I'm not the best at explaining things, but hopefully you can understand the difference.",1303865768

The main difference being that my client was written in actionscript instead of javascript.<p>The difficulty with this type of application is breaking up the computation into chunks large enough to offset the overhead of getting the data to and from the client to net a ""profit"" in terms of computation time. As the author mentioned, you have to limit the amount of CPU time that the client uses, otherwise, you'll end up potentially impacting the user negatively. Couple this with the limited amount of time between a user's browser requests and the amount of computational power at your disposal is pretty limited.<p>Although my implementation was far from optimal (it was purely academic in order to see if the concept would work), I found that in every case, it was on the order of at least 100 times slower than simply doing the computation serially(!) on the server machine. It was actually costing more time to manage the connections between the various clients and the server than the amount of computational work that I was getting from the clients.<p>Now, it's not to say that something like this couldn't potentially be made to work. But the types of computations that this sort of grid is also severely limited. Due to things like sandboxing and socket restrictions you cannot (easily) have clients collaborate together to perform more complex computations, therefore you are effectively limited to embarrassingly parallel algorithms.",1303865241

It is hard to explain Silicon Valley until you actually go there IMHO. Be vary of posers, and remember that talk is cheap. Once you calibrate yourself, get a job. Show them your portfolio. Mention that you have an engineering degree as icing. I'm sure you have some math courses and decent communication skills. Highlight these as well. Be prepared that you  may not get well compensated or work with the best people, and have to switch after 6 months (armed with the stuff you know then, you will be better off).<p>That said, I think you should reflect on the ""coding is easy"" attitude. I don't think that is correct. My undergrad was in CS and I used to think I was a code poet ... until I started doing professional coding. I personally consider coding to be more of an art than a science. I do it because I love it and it gives me more happiness than things like playing video games. As an art, I feel it will take a lifetime to perfect. I got a PhD in CS a few years ago but you know what? I still learn new things about coding almost every day. I hope it gives you a lifetime of happiness as it gives me.",1303864225

But there are plenty of other excellent arguments against <i></i>software<i></i> patents in particular, that are not valid against other kinds of patents.<p>Patents make sense when progress is fairly slow, people read patents, and patents are granted for actual innovation. Then you do want to award a patent for the rare actual invention - it helps speed progress!. These 3 conditions used to be true, more or less, for patents in general. But today none of them are true for software patents:<p>1. Progress is ridiculously fast. The entire industry changes in just a few years. And patents last for decades!<p>2. Software engineers do not read patents. Both because there is no actual benefit to doing so, and because legal counsel always says ""do not read patents.""<p>3. A huge amount of patents are granted every year, and the quality is very low. We constantly hear about ridiculous patents being granted and enforced. (And yes, I know that headlines and Slashdot summaries are misleading - you need to read the claims. But even when you <i></i>do<i></i> read those claims, in most cases the ridiculous patents are still ridiculous.)<p>So I am against software patents, as they are harmful to the industry in their current form. That is more than enough of a reason, regardless of whether software is math or not (it is).

General feedback on Windows 7 (even if it is just a glorified Vista service-pack as some claim) is that it is a lot better.<p>I've had a couple of opportunities this year to use Windows 7 desktops set up by different organizations.  And I noticed an improvement over Vista.  I wouldn't say it was completely pain free, but it is comparatively closer to an OS X level of experience than Windows XP was back in the day (whereas Vista was a decrease in that regard).<p>The question is, would you pay 70% of the price (keeping in mind student discounts on Macs) to get 75 or 80% of the quality?

The toy of my childhood.<p>My brother, sister and myself are the youngest of our cousins, and ended up inheriting all their Lego.<p>We had a whole verandah (grew up in Australia in the country) filled with our Lego city.<p>It became all encompassing.
We had no close neighbors(nearest was 6 km away) and no console until the n64 was old so it was Lego or helping Dad on the farm.<p>We had the most detailed alternate reality you could imagine.
Characters, occupations, a little economy (each of us had a primary character . And then all their accessory characters, and we would have a million dollars... Learned a lot about closed economies from that little experiment!) We made cheque books with little bits of carbon paper, and would reconcile the transactions.<p>We would start a 6 month long session by determining the rules- is space allowed? Western? Only one character? Combine with the train set for transport?) And then play out until our &#x27;dump&#x27; of all the remaining pieces was left with nothing but the rejects... Then tear down our civilisation, rub of the chalk Marks from the floorboards that laid  out the streets (we only had for pieces of road and they were all corners!)<p>I dislike that Lego only comes in kits now... The glory of Lego was in getting a massive rub of pieces and doing whatever you dreamt up out of it. 
We had a Lego police station and helicopter and a restraint, and they were great centerpieces, but the beauty of our playtime was that it was a creative effort of the the of us. 
Through out we learned/discovered economics, banking, made mini newspapers, the rules of society... I ever created my first computer program in vb so we could do our bank statements on it.<p>So much love for Lego.
Maybe Minecraft fills a similar role in today&#x27;s kids?",1424173907

This is due to the understanding in the Lego company at the time, that parents decided what to buy for their children. Therefore ads where aimed towards parents, explaining how Lego help the kids develop and learn and so on.<p>But better market analysis later showed that it was a mistaken belief. Actually it is kids that decide what they want, and parent oblige. Therefore Lego does not make this kind of ads anymore. They make marketing directly towards the consumers: The kids.",1424173850

In some sense even results like 2+2=4 are provisional, because if ZFC were inconsistent (and we can&#x27;t prove that it isn&#x27;t) then it might also be true that 2+2=3 and 2+2=5.<p>(Well, strictly we can prove that 2+2=4 in Presburger arithmetic which is provably complete and consistent. But any result that we prove by contradiction and that uses the higher axioms (e.g. Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem) is implicitly assuming the (unprovable) consistency of ZFC).<p>Mostly this doesn&#x27;t bother working mathematicians - ZFC seems reasonable, corresponds to the models that we do have, so we just take it on trust. People who care explicitly about these issues might work in a &quot;higher&quot; axiom system to prove &quot;metamathematical&quot; facts (e.g. ZFC + weakly inaccessible large cardinal, under which we can prove that ZFC is consistent and also that this particular Turing machine doesn&#x27;t halt).<p>((Of course the whole point of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems is that there&#x27;s no sharp line between mathematical and metamathematical; any unproven proposition might turn out to be an unprovable landmine.

I think this claim is mistaken.

Praising achievement is a third category of praise where consequences are assessed and not personal qualities.<p>I&#x27;m confident that positive and negative feedback about achievement are incredibly important moreso than acknowledging effort. Praising the attributes of a person is clearly just flattery so I don&#x27;t know why anyone would do it or need a study to point it out.<p>Were you to praise effort and not assess achievement, you will train people to look like they are working hard rather than actually achieving anything and not give them the feedback that will help them truly excel.",1424172712

I don&#x27;t use these technologies because they are &quot;cool&quot;, but because they solve specific problems in an efficient way. Which is probably why hackathon devs used them too. And yes, I would appreciate schema in MongoDB and types in JS, but I can live without it. Life is made of tradeoffs. Does it really matter if latest Fart App (tm) builds on transaction-safe DB and uses strong type language?<p>So, are we seeing a rise of &quot;shipping culture&quot;? Yes. Does it change how we work? Yes. Is it in some ways worse? Yes. Is it hurting us? No.",1424170931

How long can you sustain that rate ?<p>I&#x27;m supposed to be happy if I get 5% or really happy when I get 8% after extraordinary accomplishments. And if you performed extraordinary this year, that same level of performance doesn&#x27;t get you 5% next year.",1424170845

I have a few questions for you guys about reaching early users:<p>1. Is it worth to publish our Facebook page? and if so where should I publish it? are there any recommended websites, groups of beta users on Facebook that you think I should post it there?<p>2. The main thing I would like people to reach is our desktop website www.mobifile.co, where we have information about our app, and people can just sign up for the service. We also have a mobile website but it is very lean, on purpose, not to overload with information on that tiny screen.  So where is the best place to publish our website and reach those tech savvy users who will be willing to try our app?<p>3. There are many startup and products lists. I added our product on Product Hunt a long time ago, and it is not approved for some reason. we have a running beta, but for some reason, I only see the same people adding companies, and some of the products don&#x27;t even have a prototype, so the answer that PH only approve products in production does not satisfy me. What is the best way to get my product published on PH?<p>4. Are there any other lists? in addition to startupli.st and betalist?<p>5. Other ideas?<p>Thanks!<p>Illai.",1424170811

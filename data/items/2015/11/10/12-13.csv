Desktop computing power (both cpu and graphics chip) to deliver all this GUI effects was not a big deal. This was the time period before &quot;skeumorphism&quot; became persona non grata.<p>I would say the introduction of hardware-accelerated translucent UIs was a blessing and a curse for usability. The ability to cast shadows added a useful visual cue to the ubiquitous &quot;2.5D&quot; floating window manager.<p>Simultaneously, this new rendering ability allowed application windows to become translucent; undermining the 2.5D concept and sometimes making content illegible. Another technical capability was added to &quot;fix&quot; this: blurring the transparent sections, when IMHO it would be better to avoid transparency other than for shadows.",1447159024

The usual trick was to have a different background image for each corner, a different repeated background image for each edge, and a flat colour behind the text; all of this would be constrained to line up by a hierarchy of divs.<p>On the other hand, flat rectangles have always been easy, so they could be seen as the Web&#x27;s &quot;default look&quot; (if we ignore native controls).<p>I see the trend towards flat (native) UIs as a way to blur the distinction between Web sites and native applications. This certainly makes sense on mobiles, where many native applications are just an alternative UIs for Web sites (which might even be implemented in HTML/CSS/JS!).

Upon inspection, I found that Douglas inspecotors failed to see that the bottom wing bulb angles were not properly trimmed, thus the gap. I complimented our Chinese mechanics. Men of lesser experience might have tried to pull the angles together and a fatal crash would have followed. Douglas was advised via Andy Priester. I cannot praise our Chinese mechanics enough.

For that, usually need\na good version of the math\nprerequisites or will struggle.<p>Where I had good prerequisites,\nI did fine.  Otherwise I struggled.<p>The graduate work that did me\nthe most good was some quite serious work in optimization,\nmeasure theory, functional\nanalysis, probability theory,\nand stochastic processes.<p>So, then, presto, bingo, look\nat Fourier theory, L^1, L^2, \netc. and prefer it to the\nbest ice cream and cake.  Gorgeous.  Powerful.  Great\nfun -- and I understand it.\nBefore the grad studies,\nI was never quite sure\nwhat the heck had a Fourier\ntransform and what didn&#x27;t,\nwhen I could interchange order\nof integration, etc.  It was\nlike driving a car but not knowing\nhow many wheels it had.\nAt one point I got pushed\nhard into the fast Fourier\ntransform, and taken narrowly\nthat was okay, but the narrow\nview is not the one really want,\nand I had to struggle with the\nbroader view.  E.g., if have\nthe power spectrum of the noise\nand that of the signal, what\nfilter do you want?  Generally\nif do know what linear filter want, then can use the FFT to\nimplement it.  At one point\nit would have been good\nto have done such things, \nbut I didn&#x27;t\nknow how.  Now I&#x27;m sure I could\nread it, likely from N. Weiner and then from more recent sources and find it easy reading\nand/or just derive it myself.<p>Just why is the power spectrum\nthe Fourier transform of the\nauto-covariance or some such\nresult?  Then I didn&#x27;t quite\nhave the background for that;\nnow I&#x27;m tempted just to\nderive it myself.<p>Ergodic theory?  It was also\ngreat fun.  Before the grad\nschool work, <i>ergodic</i> was\njust a mystery.<p>Now I can browse and thoroughly understand and enjoy Luenberger, <i>Optimization\nby Vector Space Techniques</i>,\ne.g., Kalman filtering, deterministic optimal control,\nhigh end versions of Lagrange\nmultipliers.  A lot of\nit is based on the Hahn-Banach\ntheorem, and I saw a rock\nsolid version of that.  Before\ngrad school, Luenberger\nwould have been a bit much -- I would have struggled, often\nnot quite sure just what I\nwas doing, limited to\nsome painting by the numbers.<p>Before grad school, at times I\nwanted to know Kalman filtering\nand deterministic optimal\ncontrol but struggled.  It would\nhave helped for me to have\nknown those topics.<p>I wrote my dissertation in \nstochastic optimal control,\nbut I wished I&#x27;d been able to\nhave a good, high end course\nin such things, including with stochastic differential equations, etc.,\nbut there wasn&#x27;t much in\ncourses to pick\nfrom.  The number of US \ndepartments that know and\nteach that stuff is tiny. \nOff and on I considered\njust some independent reading\ncourses for that material,\nbut various <i>exogenous</i> events\ncaused me to run short on time\nand cash and rush to finish instead.<p>Before the grad work, I \nfound statistics to be\na cookbook of bad tasting\nmeals.<p>Now the usual statistics books\nbore me; I don&#x27;t know of a\nreally good statistics book;\nand I usually end up just\nderiving what I need for\nmyself.  With a good background\nin probability, that&#x27;s the way\nto go.<p>I had a pretty good undergrad\nmajor in math, and when that\nwas enough as prerequisites\nI did well.  E.g., I touched\non linear algebra as an ugrad\nbut wanted more.  So, I got\na stack of books on LA and\ndug in.  Of course, the best\nwas Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional\nVector Spaces</i>, but that didn&#x27;t cover everything closely related,\ne.g., applications to calculus of several variables, numerical\nlinear algebra, connections with multi-variate statistics, etc., and I got books on those for more.<p>My ugrad work didn&#x27;t do really \nwell with multi-variable calculus -- no wonder because\ntoo soon really need measure\ntheory.  So, I got partly \ncaught up on such calculus\non my own and got a lot more\nin grad school, but\nI still don&#x27;t know\ndifferential geometry\nwell enough to find general\nrelativity easy and wish I did.\nAt least now I have the\nprerequisites to learn\ndifferential geometry.  E.g.,\nas an ugrad, the courses never\ncovered the inverse and implicit \nfunction theorems (just local\nnonlinear versions of what is\nobvious in the general case of\nsolving linear equations), but\nI got some good treatments\nin my independent reading.<p>E.g., in computing, sure, \nBachus-Naur form was easy enough,\nreally is basically just\nset theory, but I never\ngot how to take such BNF and\nautomatically write a parser.\nOnce it might have been\nnice to have done that!  Or just\nuse Yacc, right?<p>> Ph.D. requisite?<p>A good Ph.D. is a good thing.\nIt&#x27;s the training in how\nto work with things that are new.<p>So, learn to zip through a lot\nof stuff don&#x27;t need to know\nwell, where K-12 and college\nand even grad courses have\nan implicit norm that such \nzip work is not good.  Good?\nHeck, it&#x27;s crucial!<p>Learn the pros/cons of \nstuff that is new.\nDo begin to lose patience\nwith things that are old --\ntoo often they are not as\ngood as might assume in a\ncourse and should be improved\non or even just set aside.<p>In doing research, just have\nto look at the material \nin a more effective way than\nthe usual way as a student\ntrying to make good grades.\nNo longer trying to make good\ngrades and, instead, are trying\nto do something new, e.g., improve\non the stuff in the text books\nor papers.<p>Also are no longer hanging on\nevery word of a prof and, instead,\nare trying to do own stuff.<p>Some of the coursework for\na Ph.D. is also usually \ndarned good.  At a good school,\ni.e., a top <i>research university</i>,\nthe difference in quality is\nlike that between\na dinner at McDonald&#x27;s and\none at a Michelin 3 star --\nno joke.  Or, if have a\ncourse in ugrad school and\nthink that the course was\nfine, if get a course from\na good researcher, very bright,\nwho knows the material from\nvarious approaches, can get\na LOT more.  The good\nresearchers are smarter --\nand not by just a little bit.<p>My view is that math, and \nmostly the advanced stuff\nand often new stuff,\nwill be the key to the\nfuture of computing, at least\nuntil the software is able to\ndo math better than humans.\nComputing only what we\ncan think of without math\nwill become way too limiting.",1447157408

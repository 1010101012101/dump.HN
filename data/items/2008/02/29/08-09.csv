125992,comment,125829,125988,0,0,pmjordan,,,"According to \n<a href=""http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?categoryId=4611686018425192155&storeId=1&catalogId=-840&langId=-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDis...</a>\na blade with two cell chips costs $10k. Two PS3s come in quite a bit cheaper than that. Okay, so they don't have as fast an interconnect and as much RAM, but it depends on your problem whether that matters at all.<p>Modern graphics cards are also useful for number-crunching, but it's pretty awkward to develop general-purpose code for them. Not that the Cell is all that easy to code for with its SPE-local SRAM and explicit DMAs for memory access. As far as I can tell, though, the Cell development tools are more mature, and it wins in terms of FLOPS-per-watt. I suspect the real win for the Cell is that its interconnect latency is tiny compared to your average GPU, which is great for clustering.<p>The thing that's killing mainstream adoption for both options in the HPC sector is lack of double-precision (64-bit) floating-point support. There's a version of Cell on its way that fixes that problem, however.<p>Note: I've not written code for the Cell myself, although I have for GPUs.",1204275490

It's quite a short read, so really there is no excuse ;-)<p>Besides it's great fun to read his real life stories and examples, since the book is from 1936. No Meg Whitman or Steve Jobs, but lots of Dale Carnegie and Thomas Jefferson.<p>If you ar e too lazy or too broke to get the book the main points are listed here: <a href=""http://www.westegg.com/unmaintained/carnegie/win-friends.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westegg.com/unmaintained/carnegie/win-friends.htm...</a>",1204275482
125990,comment,125726,125726,0,0,atoulouse,,,"Introducing technology failed horribly (in one case, at least; our smartboards fared well) at my school when Neil Bush tested Ignite!. Introducing technology to schools is tricky, because in most cases it's not essential to teaching. Often, good teachers are nervous to change what works, and the bad teachers are usually unable to make it work well. If you want more interactivity in education, I'd advise you draw up a sample curriculum and offer to work (for free) with the school's star teachers to develop the technology around their curriculums.<p>Also, if you don't mind the plug (as I am an alumni), my mixed middle-high school, Gretchen Whitney HS, is ranked #1 in CA by API, and has a few very good and forward-thinking teachers who may be willing (hopefully) to do just such a thing. Couldn't hurt to ask.",1204275093
125989,comment,125974,125974,0,0,mixmax,,,"I just started programming (always been the biz guy, but thought I might as well learn to hack) and I have a habit of never starting a new module before the current one works without any known bugs. This might take a bit longer, but when I'm done I'm done - and usually there are only minor bugs to be fixed.<p>Is this not the normal way of doing things, or am I missing something? Or is it simply because I only do simple stuff? (currently doing a website with user profiles, different sorts of to-do lists, ratings, gannt charts, a blog tool, calendar, and some ajax thrown in for the hell of it)<p>Where, in your experience, does this last unseen mountain of work come from? Am I about to be hit hard with something unexpected?",1204274989

125986,comment,125384,125720,0,0,mixmax,,,"Hackers are still not representative of the mass userbase that startups are looking for if they want to be big. This matters because hackers will value different things than normal users. RSS springs to mind as an example. If, for instance,  you do a webbased tool to keep track of your tasks one of the first things a hacker might look for is a rss feed so that he can put it on his feedreader along with all of his other feeds. Normal people won't even know what RSS is.<p>So even though you do a non-hacker product, hackers will still value features that are of littel importance to a normal crowd.",1204274500

125982,comment,125841,125961,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I quite like C++. Java is a nice language but is absolute hell to develop iterative web applications with at any reasonable speed. You need a sophisticated in-house division of labour to really use it effectively.<p>The real danger of the java language is that it's hostile to lean/agile development. If you're in a market that iterates quickly, that can be a real problem. If you work for a bank... less so.",1204274247
125981,comment,125730,125776,0,0,mixmax,,,"""For example, youtube was simply a better product for the market than google video -- even though the back-end technology was supposedly worse.""<p>I know I'm going to get hammered for saying this - but I don't think back-end code is as important as a good user interface, a well designed site, and a clear vision. Your users don't get to see the back-end code, and they don't really care how it works. And servers and bandwidth are cheap, so it doesn't matter much that your code isn't well optimised.<p>What does matter though is that you have a clear value proposition to you users, and that they will understand this within 5 seconds of arriving to your site. This is much more important than nice and clean back-end code.<p>I have a bit of experience with this - I started thinking about doing a web based project management tool around a year ago, and since I didn't know any good hackers that weren't already occupied with something else I thought I would learn how to code and just do it myself. And interestingly I found that the hard part was not the coding, but the usability and flow of the site. The coding part is basically just getting stuff in and out of a database. But the flow is really hard to get just right.",1204274064

Similarly, some live video streams on Justin.tv, a popular source for international video, were also removed. According to International Olympic Committee guidelines, the television networks with the local rights to the Games are the only legal sources of video in each country.</i><p>I think its time we grew out of the idea that companies can buy the Olympics. Its supposed to be for everyone. All that BS about unity rings pretty hollow when its for sale for $900 mil.",1218423306

If we replaced almost all of the petroleum fueled commuter travel for trips under 25 miles, this would probably have a much bigger impact on retail gasoline prices than drilling.  If we pushed for a shift from petroleum feedstocks for the chemical industry to methanol, this would also potentially have a bigger impact.  Note that both of these are achievable with technology we already have.",1218421105

272723,comment,272637,272637,0,0,geuis,,,"@alex_c and @jamesbritt You have valid points, but I think in the wrong context. The magic here starts to happen when you are aggregating many disparate people's twits. Using the summize/twitter search for a particular term or region works very well. In this case, I caught on to what happened in Toronto a few hours ago from a twit I saw. As I looked deeper into it, none of the mainstream news channels were covering it, while there were dozens of twits about it. Some of them linked to several Youtube videos, one of which I included in the post.<p>I'm not the only one to notice the breaking news Twitter effect in general. Arrington and others have posted about it as well. I just find it disturbing that something that big happens and over 12 hours later, its doesn't even have a blip on the ""mainstream"" news. God forbid it was something more widespread than this accident. Instead, we get to watch more celebrity coverage, and then 3 hours of talking heads yammering about said-celebrity(s).",1218420226

A lot of the things I've done that I'm most proud of are things that at various times I had to convince myself to work on.<p>I like what Steve Jobs said: <i>'...I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ""If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?""

272720,story,,,3,4,dkberktas,"How to survive ? ",,"I have a small problem ahead. Here is the very brief problem explanation. I am living in Turkey and just finished CS and accepted for the grad study and also I am accepted from one international company which offers a good salary and international team experience. But I am not sure any of these paths since I want to try my own way with a start-up. But things are harder then US or Europa I guess. For the last 12 months a friend and I have been developing a Web 2.0 (with Rife and GWT) application for a field in Turkey which is big in terms of vast number of possible users(and possible income for us :). We are about to make a relatively healthy release.. anyway the thing is (which is also the problem) we have absolutely no money! To get some investment from organizations like Tekmer(semi-official seeding organization in Turkey) or investors, there is always the problem of either the bureaucracy or the very clever investors who asked for %50 percent share of everything. To start our company we need some income, but to have some income, we need to sell sth. any comment or suggestion will be appreciated..thanks",1218420011

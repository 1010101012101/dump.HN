53900,comment,53834,53885,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"I agree with both of you, but I think it is wise to choose a good editor when you start. If the editor is any good, it can help you and reduce the time it takes to program, so more time is spent on thinking than typing. I'm sure you don't use Notepad or Nano.  <p>But, yeah, dead topic to me, I already chose my editor and could care less what someone else says, only if it's about a new one, then I may care.",1189615842

53895,comment,53327,53607,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think the food expense is pretty high too.  At the very least get a brita filter or something and carry around bottled water to drink.  Some people do eat a lot more though.  <p>And it's worth noting that cooking for yourself doesn't always save time.  After you consider preparation and cleanup, sometimes it consumes more.  <p>It can also be stressful if you don't have a nice kitchen, or if you have to share your kitchen with others.  Although probably one of the benefits of having founders living together is optimizing your kitchen.  ",1189615459

You can get meal plan and not have to spend time going to the grocery store so much; you tend to interact much more with other people who are also focused on similar problems and random friends don't drop by and try to drag you off on some irrelevant adventure.<p>I have a problem with that sort of thing.  I have to be a bit brutal when I'm really deep in something.  The keeping-in-your-head essay really hit the nail for me.<p>",1189613569

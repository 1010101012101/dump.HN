790490,comment,789604,790258,0,0,ehwizard,,,"Just some thoughts on your downs (i'm a dev, so opinionated in 1 direction :) )<p>* At least on my 64-bit linux box, mmap page size is 4k.  So if you have to read 100 bytes vs 4k, in the end I don't think its a big difference.  From the drives point of view, 100 bytes and 4k are basically the same, and with os file caches, it'll cache the 4k anyway most likely<p>* The JavaScript support is very optional (only db.eval and $where).  When it used it uses very little memory because nothing is really stored in it.  Its basically processing 1 record at a time and we've written a very efficient wrapper.  Also, v8 actually just released a 64-bit version, so we may look into switching back to that as well if it turns out to be a lot faster than trace monkey.<p>Why do you think its green and small?  Its actually been used in production for over 18 months (www.businessinsider.com for example)",1251420869

Maybe I have a terribly uneducated palette, but the sandwiches I can make work for me. In fact, I've never heard anyone at work complain ""I wish we had a cafeteria with a sous chef.""

Don't ask someone if he wants it, get a ""no"" answer, then turn around and do it anyway.  The former is good customer service.  The latter is shady and underhanded.<p>> The default mode for hosting providers is to drop in on the box within a couple of comments in their ticketing system...if it can't be solved with one or two replies, then it's safest to simply drop in and fix it. For most hosting customers this is not an invasion of privacy or ""breaking in"", it is ""great support"".<p>Most hosting customers don't have explicit suggestions from the host that if they don't want the hosting provider logging in to the system they can remove their SSH keys -- and, more to the point, most hosting customers don't do that then find out the hosting provider's support personnel have been rooting around (pardon the pun) in their data anyway.<p>It's ""breaking in"" in this case <i>only</i> because the SSH key for access was removed, with the hosting provider's blessing, and they basically leveraged a local access vulnerability to give themselves root access.<p>If the hosting provider had a policy that forbade customers from obstructing host administrators from logging in to the machine, articulated in the terms and conditions of use, I'd say go for it -- but that's not the situation in this case <i>at all</i>.<p>> Finally, as a security professional, I'm sure you're also aware that with access to the hardware, your host has root all the time.<p>In principle, sure -- but when there's a clearly encouraged expectation of privacy, it's <i>really</i> bad form to break in to the system against the customer's wishes by virtue of having access to the hardware.  That's a betrayal of trust.<p>> Even more interestingly, the host also has the ability to login, poke around, and never tell you about it (and not leave a trail...just boot up a live CD, mount up the disk read only, and poke around til their heart's content).<p>Indeed.  The fact it wasn't kept secret in this case just shows how little they value the customer's request that they don't log in to the system with root privileges and muck about with the customer's data.  I didn't say they were necessarily <i>malicious</i> about it -- but that doesn't mean it's not <i>bad</i>.<p>> With someone else having access to the hardware, you have nothing but good faith on the part of the hosting provider.<p>. . . or, in this case, bad faith.",1251419820

So, logging in after he'd asked them not to is definitely the ""more wrong"" of the two options.  I tend to think it was an honest mistake made by a support tech who was having a bad/busy day rather than an attempt to violate any (real or imagined) privacy pact that the company had made with Aaron.<p>As I've mentioned a few times here, the default expectation of hosting customers is that the host <i>will</i> login to find and fix problems.  From the perspective of most hosting customers, that is part of the service they are paying for (and they pay more to get more of it, as in the case of RackSpace), and if it were missing they would be angry and leave.  My guess is that the tech at Rimu simply didn't remember or notice that Aaron had requested no one ever login to his box.<p>Basically, what I'm trying to say is that, as someone that is deeply familiar with this industry, when I read the shitstorm that has been kicked up here over this (extremely minor) incident, I'm just stunned and baffled.  This is seriously a tempest in a teapot, if ever I saw one.<p>Yes, your hosting provider should respect your privacy, to the best of their ability to do so while shepherding their shared resources responsibly to provide the best service to each of their customers.  But, there is no accusation of theft of data; no reason to believe Rimuhosting acted inappropriately with the access they had; no reason to think it was done maliciously or completely without warning (Aaron admits he'd talked with them in the past about the issue); and no reason to think Rimuhosting was trying to piss anyone off.<p>Not being thoroughly informed about a customer's wishes is pretty much all one can accuse them of here.",1251417955

5726662,comment,5725341,5726396,5,0,Cushman,,,"I had this mostly written up, so I'm going to say pretty much what my sibling said in a different way :)<p>It's not about the ruleset so much as the players' attitudes.<p>There's a way to play Apples to Apples that's as a card game. You deal the cards, flip a topic, everyone puts up, the judge reveals the cards and picks a winner. It's pretty boring unless the cards themselves are hilariously lewd, hence CAH. (And I've played rounds of CAH this way that were just as boring.)<p>There's another way to play it, more like a role-playing game with the cards as a prop. The judging is a discursive experience played with the whole group. When the cards are revealed, due attention must be given to each one. ""Fuzzy like teenagers. Fuzzy like... The Clinton administration? Fuzzy like herding cats, okay. Fuzzy like... Dinosaurs."" Once all the cards are on the table, the judging begins. Unlike in the card game version, the cards which <i>aren't</i> relevant must be dealt with explicitly, and audience participation is encouraged.<p>""Dinosaurs just aren't fuzzy.""<p>""What about pterodactyls?""<p>""Yeah, birds are technically dinosaurs.""<p>""Okay, but birds aren't <i>fuzzy</i>, they're <i>fluffy</i>.""<p>""Maybe it's fuzzy on the <i>inside</i>. Like dinosaurs have nice personalities.""<p>If I'm hawking my own card, that's minus points. Or is that <i>not</i> my card, and I'm trying to sandbag it with praise? Complex interpersonal dynamics meet linguistics as every judge's turn becomes a little game to itself. And just wait until cards start to turn up that tie into previous rounds...<p>It requires the players be engaged and committed to playing with each other, rather than with the cards, but it's hopefully obvious how that's fun in a way that has little or nothing to do with the content of the cards themselves. So nothing against CAH or other forks, but people who think CAH is fun where A2A isn't probably don't understand what makes the concept fun in the first place.",1368824387

5726659,comment,5717674,5722081,2,0,fancyketchup,,,"The IR filter helps, but (this is sort-of speculation because I don't have any knowledge of the system outside of reading the patents), I think the major processing gain comes from the shutters.  In fact, I think the patents said that it <i>could</i> work (albeit much less effectively) without the IR pass filter.<p>The basic idea is a form of synchronous detection or lock-in amplification:  The shutters are arranged so that a point source is occluded at a fixed frequency, while an area source will be only partially occluded at any given time.  Due to the way it is designed, area sources should add little to the time-varying component of the photodetector signal.  The lock-in amplifier is essentially a very narrow notch filter (centered at the ""star occlusion frequency""), so it completely rejects the DC component from the sky.<p>There is a little more to it than what I'm writing, mainly because you need to not just detect the point source, but also estimate the star's position within the field of view (which IIRC is done by comparing the phase of the time-varying star signal to a reference point on the shutters).",1368824345
5726658,comment,5726585,5726585,2,0,zwieback,,,"The reason we have the grammar police but not the math police is that grammar is somehow encoded in our brains at a more fundamental level than math. I don't remember all the details but guys like Stephen Pinker argue that there's a fundamental language logic we are born with and it's expressed in grammar.<p>I don't think such a fundamental encoding exists for math, it's more of an abstraction we learn long after we've learned to speak grammatically correctly (or is that ""correct""?).<p>Having said that - yes we absolutely need the Math Police! Especially because math is easier to agree on than what's correct grammar. ""I didn't say nothin' to nobody"" to mean ""I didn't say anything to anybody"" might seem incorrect when to some but still follows a fundamental grammar logic of its own so I think the Math Police's arrest to conviction ratio would be much better.",1368824336

Take two clocks, and have one travel away from you at relativistic speeds, then turn around and come back. Because of time dilation, when the clock returns, it will have observed less time pass then you, because it was moving at relativistic speeds. However, from the clocks perspective, you were moving at relativistic speeds, so you will have observed less time pass. The resolution to this paradox involves the fact that the clock was accelerated in order to turn around.<p>An interesting side point is that in the hypothetical void, you actually have no way of knowing weather or not you are accelerating. For example, the space station is currently in free fall towards the earth, but from within the station you cannot detect this fact. Similarly, if you are in a plane that is descending at the rate of gravity, you will appear to be in zero-g. The mathematics behinds this is considerably more difficult than special relativity.",1368823014

It's a pointer to a <i></i>function<i></i> that takes a char pointer as an argument and returns (i.e., <i></i>evaluates to<i></i>) a char pointer.

A gun can be used to defend against criminals, hostile natives, or can be used for hunting.

The most dramatic change with Glass will not be the number of photos, but the applications that will be possible.<p>A while ago, a friend of mine sent me a picture he found on Facebook.  It is me and my best friends from college at a party on the first night of our freshman year.  We were all in the background of the picture -- it was completely inadvertent that we were photographed.

My friends and family upload pictures of me to Facebook without asking permission, complete with metadata, which is added to a database that has my browsing habits (surreptitiously collected) and tidbits gathered from any mention of me by those same friends.  What do you think Glass is going to add to this situation?<p>Furthermore, what solution would you propose?  We as a society already managed to dig ourselves into a hole, where we have become dependent on large corporations to satisfy our computing needs; if you want a technical solution, you are going to have to trust Google to implement it.

Today you need a great teacher that can sit down and figure out why a student has problems understanding a specific concept etc, and explain in many different ways. I don't see how computers can't do that. Online education will actually level the playing field and make the best material and pedagogy available to everyone. Today, if you get a lousy mathematics teacher, you're set back years potentially. I know, I had one for 3 years in high-school. Compared to my peers, it really set me back. Had to work very hard to catch up, but fortunately I was motivated enough to do it.<p>While Khan Academy might be good today, what I think would help even further is to find the absolute best teachers out there and ""capture"" the way they teach. Capture all the questions students have and incorporate them into the videos. For example, if there's a video talking about the number PI, the student should be able to pause in the middle of the video and see commonly asked questions and answers about this portion of the video. This also has the great benefit of students being able to go through the material at their own pace. Today teachers have to either leave half the class behind, or spend too much time on the weaker students.",1368821080

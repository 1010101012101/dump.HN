YMMV but generally: really important. If you are at the point where you are looking for five heads, you likely have competition and investor pressure. If you&#x27;re bootstrapped or have a significant moat, maybe less so, but when I&#x27;ve been in charge of tech at companies, ability to grow my team quickly has been a major KPI, and a reasonable one.<p>While I am led to believe that the easiest money is in SF, and there are some awesome investment partners, don&#x27;t assume the best advisers are necessarily there; it&#x27;s not been true for any of the three industries I&#x27;ve worked in, namely high-end fashion, recruitment software, and news/PR analysis.<p>Digging specifically in to recruitment, the fact that every recruitment startup appears to be another ATS (Applicant Tracking System) - by far the most competitive space, also the one where the established players will be some of your hardest to displace (the reasons are dull but real (ATSs have long tendrils in to all sorts of business processes)) - seems testament to my hunch that &quot;fixing hiring&quot; companies are being guided by advisers with little in the way of recruitment experience.

Be honest when certain experience doesn&#x27;t really matter.  Copy and paste general descriptions of the team&#x27;s responsibilities are not enough.  Be specific where specific skills are needed, and be general but guiding where job development paths are possible.<p>Speed:  You&#x27;re playing with people&#x27;s lives.  They depend on you for a job.  Get your responses out quickly, and don&#x27;t insist on interview upon interview.  If you&#x27;re not prepared enough in the initial interview to offer the candidate the position after interviewing all other candidates (within a week), make sure the second interview is for a well thought out alternate position.  An organization that has 3rd or 4th placed interviews has no respect for a candidate, IMHO, or is poorly planned, or basically doesn&#x27;t know what it is doing.<p>Don&#x27;t make it a competition with 2 to X people in the same room, especially as some of who are in the room may know each other, or know of each other.  You simply don&#x27;t know the relationships of the people seemingly competing &#x27;independently&#x27;.  If you need to test team work with elementary school style tasks like how to a bridge out of 4 rolls of newspaper, and I don&#x27;t think you do, do it with the existing team and the candidate, and analyze the team as much as the candidate.",1424513369
9085205,comment,9085078,9085078,0,0,yorak,,,"I&#x27;ve been pondering about this for some time and even more after the introduction of Siri, Google Now, and others. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that in the near future (artificially) intelligent personal digital assistants will become THE way majority of people will interact with the digital world. It will of course depend on how good and how quickly the assistants evolve, but the potential in productivity gains and transforming the way we live is too big opportunity to be missed. Imagine having a (real) person that would take care of simplifying and helping you with your digital and real life (calendar, meetings, notes, email, flights and other travel, anniversaries, even small research tasks like buy this or that etc.). It would help you immensely by saving time on the fluff of our daily lives and by allowing you to focus on what you deem important.<p>Therefore I think one of the most important open source projects of the next decade will be to build such a learning intelligent personal digital assistant. A Linux of our generation if you will..  Otherwise this opportunity will be lost to advertisers and others that have interest in steering movements and behavior of the masses. Does anyone know if such an FOSS initiative already exists?",1424513365

Maybe they want to sign their own hardware drivers (though, I think those don&#x27;t use the system CA store). Perhaps they want to offer signatures to customers or software vendors and feel current MS provided CAs are lacking.<p>More mundane, perhaps there&#x27;s a cheaper CA that&#x27;s accepted by some trusts, but not MS. Why should MS be trusted more than $OEM?<p>OK, fairly weak arguments, but the freedom of doing so is important. Just as it is important that users be able to verify and undo and choose their root of trust.<p>The concept of a global root of trust breaks down pretty fast.

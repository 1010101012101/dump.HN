8208626,comment,8201707,8208084,3,0,kazinator,,,"What happens when you misplace a tag, and it&#x27;s around 1995, is that browsers somehow parse it anyway without complaining, rendering the page anyway. Users then believe that this is the correct syntax: closing tags is optional, as is the order in which it is done. Twenty years later, you end up with a mess of a situation where every browser has to support not only its own historic buggy behaviors but those of other browsers.<p>You cannot &quot;misplace&quot; a closing parenthesis, at best you can have too many of them not enough.  Of course, you can enclose the wrong amount of material, but to see what is being enclosed, you just need parenthesis matching support in the editor.

I asked him what problems he was currently facing while managing his business, because I wanted to see if I could solve them with software. Out of this discussion came the idea for a B2B software that will solve a big problem for him and potentially for many other stores.<p>Since the idea looks promising, I said I would start developing it right away, and he said he would like to join me as a co-founder, saying he wants to help with the sales part, and that he is OK with me having the larger equity.<p>We didn&#x27;t discuss specific percentages yet, and I am also not sure how much he will be able to contribute, as he owns and runs 10+ stores as his full time job.<p>I am trying to come up with a fair way to split the equity, and here&#x27;s my idea:<p>1. We say that developing the product is 50% of the job, and selling it is 50%.<p>2. Since I&#x27;ll be developing it myself, I already own 50% of the product, so we just need to figure out how to split the remaining 50% (i.e., the sales part).<p>3. Once we start selling the product, we track how many sales each of us will generate during the first year. I expect that he will mainly sell via his network of contacts, while I will focus on selling it online, so we wouldn&#x27;t duplicate efforts.<p>4. After one year we split the 50% sales equity according to the percentage of sales generated by each one. For example, if we sell similar amounts each one gets 25%, so I end up with 75% of the business and he with 25%. If he outsells me 4 to 1, he gets 40% and I get 60% (50% + 10%).<p>I believe this could be fair and even productive, as it would stimulate each of us to give our best trying to market the product.<p>Do you guys think this would work?",1408642878

The author even comments on whether performance truly matters, except in very low-level tasks, so why list it first?<p>- The real difference between the two systems, program correctness and early detection of errors, is hidden under the misleading title of &quot;Debugging&quot;. It repeats the classic claim from dynamic typing proponents that &quot;runtime type errors are rarely an issue&quot;, which is wrong in my experience (I&#x27;ve seen my share of ClassCastExceptions and NullPointerExceptions on production). Also, it advocates doing Unit Testing as a way to catch type errors, which I also find wrong. I&#x27;d rather focus on writing unit tests for other types of errors the compiler cannot help me catch.<p>Other parts also irk me:<p>- It lists &quot;interactivity&quot; as a strength of dynamic typing, when lots of languages with static typing have useful REPLs.<p>- The section on Built-in datatypes is baffling.<p>- Ditto for refactoring. Static typing for refactoring is a <i>strength</i>, not a weakness. About the only valid point here is that sometimes we want to temporarily break static checking of the whole program when testing a small section, but that probably can be handled by testing in isolation.",1408642452

Since 1997, Tcl has used Tcl_Obj internally. These are called &quot;dual-ported objects&quot;, where there are two values contained therein: a string value, to maintain Tcls logical model of &quot;Everything Is A String&quot; (EIAS), and a native value of the last-used-type. For example, if the object was last used as an integer, a native int value will be stored in the &quot;internalRep&quot;. If the next use of this value is in an int context, this native internalRep value will be used. If one uses a value in an int fashion one call, then a float the next, then an int, then a float, then an int... you will incur what is called &quot;shimmering&quot;, where the interalRep is recomputed back/forth. Shimmering is something to avoid where possible.",1408641984

For instance, I think that Db major is more common than the equivalent C# major because the former has 5 flats while the latter has 7 sharps.<p>Yup, that&#x27;s true, though the choice of enharmonic keys will depend on context: e.g. the V7/V in a sharp key will be spelled in another sharp key even if more awkward, with double-sharps etc. Also, to get pedantic there are no &quot;accidentals in the key signature&quot; by definition.",1408641623

Which is why I get tired of article comparisons like this, and trust me, I wrote an article on choosing AngularJS[1] but I still wouldn&#x27;t push it on anyone.<p>Each framework has it&#x27;s advantages, and it really depends on where you and your company align with those advantages. When I started my journey I realized I needed better testing for AJAX events in jQuery, which lead me to Backbone. But in 2012 Backbone seemed like an outdated solution to an outdated app landscape. Now it seems even more outdated, but learning it certainly helped elevate my JS game to choose between Angular and Ember (though now I&#x27;d through React/Flux and/or Meteor into the mix).<p>From there it&#x27;s really about what you need, as I&#x27;ve said before. For me, a lightweight, performance-driven solution with a great testing framework was necessary. Angular is lighter weight than Ember, but both have great testing frameworks, so Angular won. If I wanted better documentation, an easier learning curve, or better community support (it happens that Rails people seem to like Ember because Yehuda works on it) I would have chosen Ember, but that wasn&#x27;t important to me or my company. Again, that was 2012-2013, today I&#x27;m still using Angular but entertaining the idea of having React replace Angular directives, which I still don&#x27;t like writing.

(Granted, they aren&#x27;t restricted to MVC either.)<p>Polymer is interesting because it&#x27;s the first one that&#x27;s geared around the idea that the browser is an app rendering engine, not a document reader.  Being able to declare your own HTML elements and bind them together could very well be the future of web development.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s still a bit immature to use commercially.<p>Hence, I chose React.  It&#x27;s idempotent, which is a fancy way of saying the markup it outputs is a strict function of the inputs it&#x27;s given - no side effects, no externally-mutable state.  This means you can live-edit your markup in your favorite editor without having to reload the browser on every save (using a tool called the Webpack Dev Server with the react-hot package).  Using Webpack also means your dependencies are explicitly declared with `require` statements.  It has all the benefits of Angular&#x27;s Dependency Injector without all the boilerplate.<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it has 0 dependency on the DOM.  This means you can render your initial request on the server, and pass markup down to the client that&#x27;s indistinguishable from what you&#x27;d traditionally get from Flask/Django/Rails/PHP.  There are no assumptions that your client speaks JavaScript, so it&#x27;s more friendly to non-browser clients like searchbots, which is in turn safer for SEO.  It also means your view is already rendered when it reaches the client, which is important in a world where many clients are phones with underpowered JS capabilities.  You get both the benefits of a single-page-app (slow client rendering is still faster than slower network requests, and network requests are smaller if you don&#x27;t have to also send down the template every time) and those of a server-side one (SEO is maintained, and the client can display your page without waiting to execute the JS first).<p>I should disclaim that I haven&#x27;t seriously considered Ember since it&#x27;s been rebranded from SproutCore; however, I have worked on a few Angular apps; and even forgoing the above benefits, React is just easier to work with.",1408641576

I think that a major motive for choosing dynamic programming languages is that programmers want to get things running correctly and spend more time on the logic and less on making ritual invocations to the type system that are redundant with other elements of the code. (Haskell and other similar languages with very strong type inference are making this a <i>less</i> compelling reason to choose a dynamic language, but I think it remains an important one for many real decisions, as Haskell hasn&#x27;t yet acheived the ecosystem and mind-share where its always likely to be considered as an alternative, and not rejected for reasons other than its type system.)<p>I think people who choose static languages do so because of concerns for correctness, but I think it is a mistake to reverse that to conclude that those who choose dynamic languages do so <i>because</i> they aren&#x27;t concerned with correctness; many do so because the hoops you need to jump through in mainstream static languages are perceived as being a too-expensive way to <i>get</i> the (often very limited, given the lack of expressiveness in the type systems in many popular static languages) help in correctness that the static nature of the language provides.",1408641196

8208400,comment,8207838,8208007,2,0,Joeri,,,"I&#x27;ve been developing on the sencha products for years. Primarily an ExtJS single page app developed by a large team since 2008 that&#x27;s now well on its way to 200.000 lines of code. I also wrote a 5 kloc app in sencha touch.<p>The thing about sencha that makes them different is that they abstract away the html and css parts to a large degree, by constructing the dom programmatically behind an abstracted component api (e.g., a panel component has a title bar, several toolbars, and multiple child components laid out using border, anchor, column or any of the other layout systems). The upside is that the ui controls are richer than standard html controls and require fewer lines to do advanced things (like having a field with server-backed autocomplete). The downside is that html+css skills don&#x27;t translate well, if at all. Instead of thinking in terms of dom updates, html templates and style rules, you think in terms of the component lifecycle, the container layout system and themes. The skillset required is extensive and specific, and the code is so deeply tied to extjs that no part of it can be reused outside of it.<p>Some people like it, some people don&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t fight the framework. You have to adopt sencha&#x27;s architecture and component system completely, or you will have a painful time. We have had to invest extensively in training because the framework is so different from other js frameworks that new developers have a hard time learning it.<p>As for the whole she-bang, sencha cmd, sencha architect and so on. I tried those tools several times, but they always lacked maturity. The last time i looked at it is 2 years ago though, so they may have improved. Meanwhile we just use the frameworks.<p>Update: I realized I didn&#x27;t actually say whether I would recommend it or not. I would not choose ExtJS again, but I would choose sencha touch again, despite the API&#x27;s being so similar. I feel like the use-case of writing a mobile cross-platform app fits in well with the sencha architecture and api, better than other js frameworks. By contrast ExtJS isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s no better than the free alternatives like ember or angular for building traditional web apps, so I don&#x27;t see the point in spending the money on a license if you&#x27;re starting from scratch.",1408640992

Don&#x27;t take this post as anything other than fun noodling about -- the fundamental fact is that no city is trying to raise revenue this way.<p>The simple answer to your objection is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you stop at a light for 30 seconds or 60, you still decelerate to a stop and accelerate to your cruising speed again -- the marginal difference is idle time, not decelerate/accelerate time.<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; but you say, &quot;But presumably if the red light is longer, some number of people who would have in the counterfactual world cruised through the green light will instead come to it while it is red, decelerate, stop, and accelerate again.&quot;<p>True enough.  But while that light is red, another light is green -- for longer, presumably.  So compared to the counterfactual, some cars who would have come down to the stop at the red in the other direction are instead cruising through the intersection.<p>(I presume, here, that nobody actually just sets the intersection to &quot;all lights red&quot; for extended periods of time.  That would indeed increase the gas use of everyone in the city, but it also rather gives the game away.)<p>Indeed, ignoring the all-lights-red approach, the fact is that presumably however long you set the reds for, the intersection spends 50% of its time red and 50% green (or whatever for more complicated intersections, but the point is, you aren&#x27;t altering the overall amount of red at the intersection, you&#x27;re just changing it from many shorter intervals to fewer longer intervals).  That being the case, we can reasonably answer whether it&#x27;s possible to raise revenue at all here.  Is every increased stop balanced by a missed stop?<p>And the answer to that depends on whether it&#x27;s more or less efficient for overall city traffic to have longer or shorter reds.  My intuition fails to provide an answer, and I don&#x27;t have any formal background in traffic engineering.<p>But in any case, the difference seems unlikely -- at moderately reasonable red light lengths -- to make drastic changes to the city.  At which point the $25/resident/year that I earlier estimated starts to look like a huge overestimate.<p>TL;DR:  There is no conceivable way that cities are cynically lengthening red lights to raise revenue.  Not effectively, at least.",1408640668

An unsophisticated user would be finished.</i><p>I hear this a lot, but nobody ever actually describes the problem they have.  You mentioned priting.  On my minimal Debian box, you point your web browser at <a href=""http://localhost:631"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:631</a> and click shit and then the printer works.  (If you want to improve print quality / feature support, then you probably need to google to decide which driver is best.)<p>On my Ubuntu 11.04 box, you type ""printing"" into the thing at the top left, click ""add printer"", click ""network printer"", click ""find"", and click ""ok"".  That's it.  Then you have that printer in every application, and from the command line via lpr.<p>It can't get any easier.<p>The only way you can run into problems is if you buy a printer that's not supported by Linux.  And I think that's where most people run into trouble -- they buy something unsupported, and then spend three months googling in the hopes that maybe it's not really unsupported.  One time in ten, it turns out that it is.  The other nine times lead to stories like ""Linux never works"".<p>Nope, shitty hardware never works.

2646000,comment,2611281,2612237,1,0,billoreilllly,,,"I think everyone is missing the biggest factors here - faith and integration. The way something becomes currency, is that people believe it will still have value in the future, and it becomes widely accepted for goods and services. These are, by far, the two largest factors that could drive even a digital currency into use, by themselves. This is why Bitcoin is so risky - nobody knows if the general public (albeit the entire public) will eventually accept Bitcoins for their product. I'm pretty sure that if certain companies had not started accepting them as valid currency, the Bitcoin would already be worthless. But because companies, which are large groups of people, believed enough that the Bitcoin would be worth something between the time that it was received for a product and then spent again, Bitcoins survived and even increased in value. Since there is no way to know if people will want to use these other than to throw currency to the wall and see what sticks, it is extremely risky. I would NOT recommend anyone pay for Bitcoins with an already-tested currency such as cash or credit. If you are, however, interested in acquiring a few of these Bitcoins, try getting free ones for online services, such as ""mining"", completing surveys, answering captcha's, etc.",1307864920

Couldn't you as easily say that Amazon has been abetting tax evasion for years?  Who moved your cheese?  Was it the Connecticut legislature or Amazon?  Well, yes.<p>Connecticut wants that 6%.  Not sometimes.  Always.  So they passed a law.  Given a choice between collecting a 6% tax and hanging out their long-time affiliates partners to dry, Amazon picked the latter.<p>Even though I live in a high-tax state with a similar use tax requirement, I don't think Amazon's position is reasonable.  Use tax compliance rates are generally pitiful.  Both state and the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act allow for this kind of use tax.  Local sales tax collection is not optional.<p>The goods in question do not magically teleport into the homes of Connecticut residents.  They come over state roads, often carried by state residents in big trucks.  If they weren't bought over the internet, they'd be bought at stores where residents would be paying 6% or more.",1307862715

2645928,comment,2645671,2645865,3,0,vecter,,,"I highly recommend Andrew Ng's lectures also. I was going through them myself, and he does a good job of explaining the intuition behind many things (of which the math, although important, is only a formalization of).<p>One piece of advice I would give from my own experience is that you have to play with data to get practical experience applying the methods. Machine learning is <i>not</i> a set of plug and play blackboxes that you can feed random input into and get clean output. You have to spend a lot of effort understanding your data and how they relate to the specific method you're using. For example, if you use linear regression as your learning model, you have to understand what kind of relationship is assumed between the inputs and outputs (in this case, that the output is a linear combination of the inputs).<p>I know this because when I started, I would just toss unclean, unfiltered, and untransformed data into a method and hope for good results. Of course I fed garbage in, so I got garbage out.<p>Another word of advice is to watch out for overfitting. Often, you'll find that your training gives you good in-sample statistics (for example, with linear regression you'll get great R^2 with high p-values). However, when you test out of sample, you'll realize quickly that most of the models you've fit are overfit to the data that you trained on. Just something to be aware of.<p>I guess both of these may be very abstract and useless for you right now, but hopefully one day you'll look back and able to find use for it.",1307862579

Now I seriously doubt that Google will begin to blacklist these sites. That would be a step just a bit far. That is true censorship.<p>For now they'll let you find whatever you want, legal or not. They just won't give you any extra help along the way. I mean, even without the bells and whistles like autocomplete, spelling corrections, +1 suggestions, etc. you can still very easily find anything on Google without much effort.<p>It isn't Google's job to punish illegal activity but they have every right to take away the extra helpful tools that basically shove it in your face. In fact, why would Google even want to censor sites that contain illegal material? Forget the outrage about censorship for a moment. I think law enforcement would want ""bad apple"" sites in Googles index so they can be easily found and their owners prosecuted.",1322096276

Do like Rollerblades? I much prefer inline skates. See what I'm saying?<p>The real solution would be to solve the piracy problem and have the BitTorrent protocol go back to being widely used for its intended purpose. It wasnr intended as a piracy tool, it was intended to be an efficient, decentralized file sharing tool like p2p networks. If those protocols were being used to share the newest office memo in the company network or just non piracy related files in general then there'd be no need to the restriction and it's unintended consequences and we could revert the autocomplete policy.<p>It's the rule breakers that made it this way and that's where your frustration should be directed. But I'll admit that's pretty hard these days. I'm only 25 and I'm the exception but the rest of my generation and younger seem to think piracy is fine and have this sense of entitlement about it. That needs to stop.<p>It's pretty clear this isn't arbitrary just like the Rollerblade example I gave before. Typical users often think you have to type in a URL into the search engine. They never use the address bar! They get from site to site using a 3 step process. 1) Go to search engine of choice. 2 Type in desired URL 3) Click the first result.

3272491,comment,3270768,3272126,1,0,munificent,,,"> But you will need to carefully educate coders about that, since relying on overflow is common in popular languages like C and C++.<p>This is something we're aware of and we know we need to be extra clear and loud about it.<p>> Also, integer overflow is not the only case where this problem arises.<p>As far as I know, bigints are the <i>only</i> place where the VM and the generated JS intentionally differ in behavior. We are trying very hard to keep the two in sync.<p>> It also happens with say division of an integer. Will Dart compiled code in JS add proper rounding correction to all divisions of integers?<p>Dart has two division operators (~/ and /) to handle this. The former rounds (truncates? I'm not sure) and the latter does floating point division. So it's always the operation that determines the type of the result, and not the type of the operands.<p>> Overall, it seems much simpler and safer to just correct overflows in the compiled code.<p>Simpler: yes. Safer: yes. Unfortunately, it's also <i>much</i> slower.<p>Rolling your own numeric type in JS means slower behavior when you have overflowed and slow behavior even when you haven't. If you're generating code for ""a + b"", you can't compile that to ""a + b"" in JS because you need to check for overflow and handle the fact that a or b could be bignums.<p>We really want the compiled JS to behave the same as native code, but if it's significantly slower, people just won't use it at all.

3272433,story,,,3,7,zeynalov,"Ask HN: How to automate?",,"I am a single founder and I started a start-up a few month ago and accidentally(!) I got too many costumers. I mean it was a side project just to earn some money to be able to build my main start-up. I invested 100$ dollars, 25 days of designing, coding, writing the content and marketing. In the first month I made 20.000$ and this was very motivational to advance. By the time I got much more costumers, because of uniqueness of the product spreading the word-of-mouth. Idea was simple, helping students from Azerbaijan, to apply to the internships in Germany, German universities, language courses, and so on. But because it must be a side project I must automate the process. I hired 3 guys to help me, working from their own home as the freelancers. I am the only one, who knows every bureaucratic details how to come to Germany, and at the same time speaking azerbaijani and german. I teached my freelancers how to answer to the costumers, every detail. So must freelancers automate my works, and so I can only advance the company and grow. But now I noticed, because I teached these freelancers everything about our company, they ignore the costumers contacting to us and after that they contact the costumers personally and get the work personally done. As you see, I lost half of my routine costumers. Now I can't figure out, how can I automate the process. I thought about building a platform, where costumers and freelancers can only communicate, without ability to speak with them out of this platform. But no chance, at the end of every conversations, they got the emails, and working with them personally.<p>Working in an office is also not a solution. Does anyone has an experience like this?

Microsoft would be an instance in which an illegal monopoly (read the court findings, folks) was not split, as many commentators suggested, but regulated. It's arguable that this did result in a loss of standing as a monopoly, though how much of this is a matter of a shifting computer market (servers, mobile, cloud) and how much an erosion of Microsoft's still overwhelmingly dominant share of desktop OS and office suite markets is also of interest.<p>NB: I think Microsoft should have been partitioned, and that it still behaves as if it had and seeks an illegal monopoly, though its power has been greatly diminished.",1322094129

I've always been impressed with GNOME and think it's a better interface than OSX or Windows 7. When I switched to Ubuntu a few years ago (I've since switched back to Windows for various reasons), I expected to have a really stable operating system that was perhaps a little harder to use than a mainstream OS. What I found was that it was actually a joy to use, but it was really unstable. Not because of the OS itself, but because of the buggy apps that ran on top of it. Linux users have some great apps, but are still stuck with subpar alternatives for a lot of stuff (particularly in multimedia).<p>And then there's hardware support. From what I've heard, things are pretty easy on desktops, but I had a lot of trouble using it on laptops. There are a few companies that sell laptops with Ubuntu or other distros preloaded, but other than that you can face a lot of challenges trying to wrap Windows drivers and so forth.<p>The hardware aspect might be easier on phones and tablets, but it's going to mean starting almost entirely over on the UI and applications (which is the direction Unity is going).",1322093929

Skipping the difficulties you would have in creating it and the system that had to be built to support it, can you imagine being able to talk to someone in another city for the very first time?  That is a concept that goes so far beyond simple that it is magical.<p>So, I think I can accept ""simple is what you are comfortable with, even if you are ignorant of many details.""  How do you keep stuff cold in your house?  Simple, put it in the fridge.  How does the fridge work?  Well...",1322093225
3272389,comment,3268831,3268831,1,0,corny,,,"Here's my system:<p>As a background, I have no debt right now but I did also use this system when I did. I use my credit card for everything I can (to earn points) and pay it off every month. I have several savings accounts with ING Direct that I use for various large regular or upcoming expenses, plus an emergency account.<p>I have a hard time budgeting so rather than keep track of all my purchases, I just keep track of my accounts. I built a simple app (but you could probably use Mint.com or a spreadsheet) that displays the balance of each account. Accounts include: savings accounts, credit card, and retirement account. When I had a student loan that was listed here too. I rent but if I had a mortgage I would include the amount owing as a loan account and the estimated equity in the home as a ""capital"" account. All of these balances are totalled up and I can see my overall net worth (it's rough). When looking at this view, my goal is ultimately to raise the overall interest earned across all accounts.<p>I also have a spreadsheet which acts as a checklist for my savings goals. A prioritized list of goals runs down the side and each column is a month. Every month I try to check off each goal. They are prioritized like so:\n* Credit Card (balance = zero at least once)\n* Chequing Acct. (Min. balance = $x)\n* Taxes (x% of revenue set aside)\n* Retirement ($x set aside)\n* Vacation ($x set aside)\n* Downpayment ($x set aside until I reach $x)\n* New Car ($x set aside until I reach $x)<p>I have an emergency account, but if I didn't it would be near the top of this list, probably just before retirement.<p>Any large, non-necessary, one-time purchase is considered months in advance and added to the bottom of this checklist. Only when I've enough money saved will I purchase it. Them's the breaks.<p>This checklist is easier than a regular budget. As long as my goals are realistic and I'm completing them, I have nothing else to worry about. If I regularly have trouble completing goals I can adjust the goals and/or my spending. I check in with these two documents about once a week.<p>In terms of specific advice for your situation I would say... focus on eliminating your credit card debt before all other savings or debts. When that's done, make minimum payments on your student loan and build up a decent emergency fund. And only when that's done, split your payments between student loan, retirement savings, and other savings.",1322093210

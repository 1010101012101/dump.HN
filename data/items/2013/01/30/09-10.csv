People get upset about wars, murders, have extensive fire safety requirements, covers for their pools, hide their poison and medicines from children, panic over their children being abducted or falling pregnant etc., yet suicidal depression?

If you have decided to take your life, the worst thing you want (in some cases) is for someone try and prevent it from happening.<p>Also, depression never leaves you alone, so there will be multiple points in your life where you will think about taking your own life, and you will yourself doubt whether you will go through with it up to the point of pulling the trigger, so you don't want to tell someone and ""waste their time"" if you are not sure you are going to do it.<p>Its pretty crazy how these things work, and the best way out for me in helping such people has been to physically take them to a professional, every time, every session, until someone certifies them as no longer depressed.

To combine them you don't even need to wait for the processing to finish, because you just create another Future.<p>Also, being able to pass them around is a really important use-case and Futures are also all about error handling. With Scala it's really trivial to wrap the async support in Servlets 3.0 and make your controllers return Future responses. Then in the servlet you just attach onComplete and onFailure events to return the request when it's ready or when it fails. Works like a charm.<p>The greatest thing about Futures is that the concept is entirely agnostic to the underlying implementation details. You could have a Future result that's being processed asynchronously by an IO loop (e.g. ning's AsyncHttpClient), you could have a Future result that's being processed by a thread and you can combine the results.<p>If anything, I don't think you worked with Futures much. You should try it out in Scala, where Futures (from Akka or Scala 2.10) are modelled as monadic types, making them highly composable. Doing multi-threading with Futures in Scala is like working with Lego blocks.",1359537965

It's a pretty awesome little gadget, fully open-hardware and open-source light with a 10W RGB+white LED and an arduino core that I'm targeting trying to sell for $70 each.<p>Unfortunately, the time it's taken me to design this has meant that I haven't had a full-time job in over a year. So, I don't really have the $40k or so it'd take to build 1000 first-run units.<p>As such, my first thought turns to kickstarter. But they charge 5% fees on the project, plus the 3.5% credit card fees, plus I may have to pay Philips patent royalties (probably not since these are prizes, not sales), plus I may have to do FCC certification tests (probably not since these are prizes, not sales), the list of ""incidental"" expenses goes on and on.<p>I think I might be able to do better if I could do something equivalent to kickstarter pre-orders on my own website, but how does one go about managing an eskrow of this kind? Is it possible, or is the only reason it works because kickstarter is there to manage it and make sure that the eskrow works properly? It may not sound like much, but that 5% overhead fee is a noticeable chunk of my revenue; enough that I have to remove components from the light to accommodate it.<p>If anyone is curious also, here is a link to the schematic:\nhttp://db.tt/ResLCCbY<p>It started with a lot more stuff, then got pared down to almost nothing, then had a lot more stuff added again, and then got pared down again...

Maybe it's because heavier-than-air flight just doesn't jive mentally, or maybe it's because you have very little personal control when flying. Either way, you carry these batteries on your person, in your coat pocket, in a bag, leave them in your study downstairs, hell, drive around in a big box made of them. Fisker Karmas were in the nasty habit of bursting into flames, but that was viewed as a one-off design flaw, not a crushing blow to 'batteries in cars' as a concept. I think the collective anxiety we feel towards planes, as a culture, shapes our views of these incidents too much. If your car was on fire on the highway you may not have handled it as well as the pilot in this scenario.",1359536408

The font(s) look kind of 9-pin dot matrix, and the screen shots are not very clear (it's hard to see what the text says in them).",1220893191
298504,comment,297616,297812,0,0,ryanmahoski,,,"Den: <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/2008/office.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/2008/office.jpg</a> Notice the hard wood floor I built on top of the carpet so the chair's casters would glide smoothly. Cost me $50 in wood and an hour's time but it beats those plastic mats you get at office supply stores which inevitably fail on thick carpet. The photo was for a recent craigslist ad to sell the display and MP. Hence why the MP is on the desk instead of the floor. And why the display shows stock Leopard, and why the keyboard and mouse are stock and why it appears I'm using that goofy keyboard tray. At one point, I had the MP in the right side compartment but when I closed the door the fans blared and I realized there was no ventilation - so I nixed that soundproofing hack. I prefer the mobility of a laptop now but miss the extra productivity of the desk setup, particularly when coupled with a Logitech MX Revolution mouse (not pictured, highly recommended).",1220893162

They've grown so large and ossified to such an extent, such an attempt would end up a move in Google's favor.  If Microsoft wants to create their own controlled, sanitized version of the Internet, let them.  They'll fail to respond to the market, and the market will move past them.  AOL's already been done, and its time is past.  Kids now grow up with the Internet, and shepherding by marketers is just seen as an annoyance.",1220892356

Perhaps combined with my heightened sense of self-preservation it's why my ancestors managed to survive, after all a few of them fought in world wars and had kids afterwards. My lineage wasn't conceived by a lack of birth control and horny teenagers, my genes actually come from survivors of WW1 and WW2... and as I'm English likely the survivors of many, many more wars, as we really liked them.<p>Anyway, I'm losing my point. At the moment I'm trying to type up some of my work, which I'm completely ignoring. However, I found a great radio station that's not available in the southern Toronto region (thewolf.ca).

I can agree with this on some level, there is a lot of psychological disturbance among human beings and has been throughout history.<p>I'm wondering if you are aware that there is ample evidence in the work of Adorno and his collegues (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality</a>), Lloyd deMause and the Institute for Psychohistory (<a href=""http://www.psychohistory.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychohistory.com/</a>) and Alice Miller (<a href=""http://www.alice-miller.com/index_en.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alice-miller.com/index_en.php</a>) that political and military disasters are not linked to something intrinsic and inevitable in human nature, but rather to childhood and even prenatal experiences that can be avoided?<p>If you haven't, you might take a look at Lloyd deMause's book ""The Emotional Life of Nations"" (readable online: <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/childhod/chindex.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/childhod/chindex.htm</a>), which I think traces this ability of humans to murder and pillage to it's source and provides a plan for how it can be eliminated in the future.",1220890806

I just mean that if you have twenty people with five stocks each, versus one person with 100, I am betting that the latter will have more disasters, and fewer great picks. Although from one day to the next, 100 will show lower volatility.<p>Sort of like how if you decided to pursue your MD, JD, MBA, and PhD, this diversification would insulate you from the risk that you're not cut out for legal work.

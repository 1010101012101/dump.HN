If you want that -- which should be <i>extremely</i> rare! -- you talk to a high-level manager who is competent at authenticating you.<p>* Send the email that says &quot;hey, we&#x27;re going to change your email address now&quot; with a lead time to allow for the possibility that, even after your authentication, you&#x27;ve been conned.<p>* Make a phone call to the phone number on record, too.<p>You ask what&#x27;s gained by faulting SendGrid, because you take it as a given that they will make these changes.

7478301,comment,7477801,7478083,15,0,objclxt,,,"> <i>Alas with the extremely slow state of regulatory changes, many people that could be already saved nowadays using these techniques are just ending up dead.</i><p>I think the article touches upon this, but it&#x27;s a little more nuanced than &#x27;regulatory changes&#x27;, because with this technique  there is no time for informed consent, and doctors understandably want to avoid a situation carrying out this procedure on a patient who then subsequently died but <i>could have survived</i> were another treatment approach taken.<p>On the one hand many people do end up dying prematurely because they were not able to benefit from the latest medical technology: on the other, but on the other these new technologies may have substantial short and long term side effects that we&#x27;re not fully aware of yet.<p>To give you some examples: many medical professionals are now arguing for <i>stronger</i> regulation of antibiotics because a lack of prior regulation has resulted in widespread drug resistance. Ritonavir is a antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV which during clinical trials was very promising, but after being released was found to be polymorphic and convert in-situ to a different structure which was useless (the drug had to be taken off the market and re-formulated). Thalidomide is a classic case of a wonder-drug which subsequently was found to be wholly inappropriate.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone in the medical profession would argue we should deprive people of the most effective treatment - indeed, it is standard practice in a double-blind trial to halt the placebo participants if the drug being tested proves to be overwhelmingly effective, because it would be unethical to continue. However, it takes time, effort, money, and regulation to establish how that treatment works and what side effects it might have.",1395889159

7478288,comment,7475125,7476053,2,0,hyperpape,,,"What are you basing this on? It seems wrong both in terms of the size of the handicap and the strength of Ishida.<p>Ishida first: while he is certainly not top 100 in the world anymore, he is quite probably top 1000 (there are something like 1500 professionals out there, and he is probably above average for Japanese professionals, maybe above average for all the countries (see <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=yoshio+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Figokisen.web.fc2.com%2F&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=yoshio+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fi...</a>).

And in any case, other professionals have lost at four stones (see <a href=""http://www.computer-go.info/h-c/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer-go.info/h-c/index.html</a>).<p>Second, regarding the handicap: I am not knowledge enough about chess to say, but it sounds high. In Go, I have beaten players who officially should give me three stones (though as you approach professional strength, it is true that players would be better at preserving that advantage and converting it into a win). I&#x27;d estimate the handicap as somewhere between 400 and 600 GoR points (which are similar in spirit to ELO ratings--<a href=""http://senseis.xmp.net/?EGFRatingSystem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://senseis.xmp.net/?EGFRatingSystem</a>).

But it gives you no guarantee that if your dev build got version 0.1.2 of a transitive dependency, then your CI server will also get version 0.1.2, and not 0.1.3.<p>If it turns out that your app works with 0.1.2 but not with 0.1.3, then your dev machine will reproducibly produce working builds, while your CI server will reproducibly produce broken builds.<p>What&#x27;s really needed is an analogue to the Gemfile.lock used by Ruby or npm-shrinkwrap.json in the Node world, which is checked into version control, and freezes the <i>exact</i> versions of all transitive dependencies until explicitly updated.

Now, if you know Vim, ask yourself, was it worth it? I&#x27;m convinced 99% of people would say yes. It is the same with Haskell, all those seemingly complex concepts come with a big reward.<p>Learning Haskell is easier with a strong functional programming background; sadly CS students don&#x27;t learn much about FP, so having lots of experience in CS and compilers won&#x27;t necessarily put you in a better position than somebody who has no formal background in CS but lots of programming experience.<p>A math background on the other hand should help you. Learn about how category theory is applied in Haskell, and you&#x27;re already half way there. Monads are just a piece of the puzzle.<p>I do agree with your last three points. I haven&#x27;t used Haskell in production, so my experience in &quot;real world Haskell&quot; is limited, but it has helped me immensely in my daily work with other languages. Haskell forever changes the way you think and approach problems, just like Vim changes the way you write and edit code; it will make you a better programmer.",1395888601

(Creating a you-call-me library would probably make it too easy to accidentally bypass the security,  vs. an I-call-you framework that is guaranteed to go through the secure code path before and after your code.)<p>Still, if there was a standard for middleware in general you probably could at least get all the headers right and provide some sort of safe, general CSRF, session, and <i>authentication</i> (not authorization) framework that way.

They are also useful for forming ballpark estimates.<p>Oculus VR says it has sold 75 000 &quot;development kits&quot; [1]. It has been 1 year and 7 months since August 2012 [2], when Oculus VR began selling its development kits. Let&#x27;s assume a 200% YoY 2013 growth rate - that means 56 000 kits were sold in 2013. Let&#x27;s say these keep selling at the $350 the Developer Kit 2 goes for [3]. That&#x27;s $20 million in 2013 revenues.

Of course, on paper the goals are to produce functional, profitable products, that are cost effective and easy to maintain in the long term.  Sure, what it is important to realize that just as them being a contractor the layers or middle managers are also contractors in a way and you just sub-contract for them.  They have internalized the incentive structure where they get paid to do work. To look busy. To find a lowest bidder and so on. And, this is important, they found a way to not get punished if they fail to deliver a product as promised. This goes all the way to the CEO.<p>One can land in the middle of such a situation but what they don&#x27;t realize that it took decades probably for this kind of incentives and constrains to be internalized. Some industries have this dysfunction in them them more than others. Hoards of &quot;consultants&quot; (read temporary, project based workers) know and understand this.

Thank you for clearing that up for me.<p><i>I did not mean to delete the comment you replied to. I have included it below:</i><p>It is terribly confusing analogy for me. Initially I thought the computer engine analogy was what was intended. But then I started thinking about someone rated 2100, down two bishops playing stockfish on a decent box with 3-4-5 EGTBs and a two bishop advantage. That seemed like a no brainer so I moved on to crafty, and then GNU chess and then what? I realized that I could not think of an engine that would consider a win with two bishops an accomplishment. As far as &quot;maybe 2600 is a better target&quot; goes you have to go all the way down to #88 on the CCRL in order to get to 2600.[^1] That is with even material and definitely not using 64 cores (the CCRL uses a AMD X2 4600+ at 2.4GHz benchmark).<p>I am sorry but thinking about a chess engine running on 64 cores with a two bishop advantage against a 2100 rated human is not reasonable. If I knew nothing about computers and Go I could reasonably read the 2-bishops/2100-ELO analogy and conclude that CrazyStone was laughable.

After going through the process many times over the last month, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that there were essentially 3 good ways to evaluate me:<p>1) Give me a take home problem.<p>Granted, a couple of the companies that gave me these problems clearly didn&#x27;t know how to interpret what I gave back to them.  One of the comments I got back actually offered as a criticism that my code looked &quot;too sparse.&quot;  But if you actually have the ability to make sound judgments, this seems to me to be the ideal way to judge a candidate.<p>No one is coding over the phone (ever) or with someone watching over their shoulder even most of the time, so if you reject someone just because they can&#x27;t perform under such pressure, you&#x27;re going to have a lot of false negatives.<p>2) Ask a breadth of questions.<p>One of the other interviews which I excelled at was a series of 20 questions that asked me about things ranging from what happens when a browser makes a request to a server, to what a CDN was, to what the difference between UDP and TCP was.  This was only a small part of the range of what was asked, but the fact that I was able to speak with confidence on most of the issues showed that I had a strong foundation of knowledge.  They also asked my confidence in each area before asking me the questions, which I imagine helped them gauge whether I was down to earth enough to even recognize the things I didn&#x27;t know.<p>3) Ask a depth question.<p>Drill down deep into a specific problem that the interviewee seems comfortable enough in.  For this one, it could be entirely theoretical, such as how one might build a particular system to solve a problem.  The key is that you want to dig into why they make any particular choice along the way.<p>You should look for someone willing to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know about X, I&#x27;d probably look for the reference to learn if there&#x27;s a data structure to solve Y&quot; if you end up getting too deep.

7478150,comment,7474600,7476998,5,0,chinpokomon,,,"Perhaps, but I think it still goes against the original intent. Ctrl-~ or Ctrl-^ should give you a record separator (RS) and Ctrl-Del or Ctrl-_ should give you a unit separator (US). For the same reason Ctrl-m or Ctrl-M should give you carriage return (CR). This is because ASCII values from 00-1F are <i>control</i> characters and effectively grounded the most significant bits 7 and 6. Shift similarly would toggle or ground bit 6, depending on the implementation.<p>What happened was that the Ctrl key became synonymous with &quot;command&quot; after Teletype, so it became more about doing something. Think about Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c, and Ctrl-v as an example, but you still see some relics like Ctrl-d as End of Transmission (EOT) to close a shell or terminal. Alt is like a shift, but it is actually closer to the Fn key on most laptop keyboards. It was an alternative function of that particular key, so where the shift key provided you with an alternate case, Alt was more akin to an entirely different key... it isn&#x27;t Alt plus an &#x27;a&#x27; key, it is Alt-a.<p>AltGr was like another Alt key. It was originally there to allow you to enter an alternate glyph, especially line drawing characters available in extended ASCII, B0-DF. I thought it was a mapping closer to flipping the most significant bit to 1, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly overlay the lower ASCII range, so that might be another change that evolved on the way to the modern keyboard.<p>To your original point, Microsoft Windows will now usually treat the chord Ctrl-Alt as AltGr. I don&#x27;t know if that is with all layouts, or just those keyboards that lack AltGr. I find that most Linux distributions tend to follow Microsoft&#x27;s lead and provide similar mappings but now they even repurposed the Win key as Meta or sometimes called Super. So it is likely that Ctrl-Alt is commonly the equivalent of AltGr.<p>For the propose of this discussion, I think it&#x27;d be better if Ctrl could be used to type these text separators, but the way modern operating systems map their modern keyboards, it might be difficult to ever reach consensus on how this should be done.",1395886498

7478147,comment,7477918,7477918,2,0,bertil,,,"I started a PhD, but that wasn’t a hard choice for me: everyone (male) in my family’s recorded history (that’s up to the Reformation) has had at least one, I graduated in Statistics meaning half the job was done -- and I had an interest in applied science, meaning financing was doable, and I would go though it protected by the guarantee that I wasn’t eyeing for that one single position every one of the fifteen candidate was hoping to get.<p>It was great in amazing ways, and hard as hell: Great because I could spend a week reading someone’s detailed complete work (yay!) and literally say: There is one footnote in that paper that no-one read that I think is bullsh-t; the only copy of the book referenced in in another country, and they won’t send a scan; can I go there and check? I talked to Nobel laureates, and got my ideas crushed beyond recognition… That was fun.<p>The bad part was… I was fairly fragile psychologically before (six of my close friends committed suicide in the years prior, I had a couple of severe depression episodes prior) That was rough -- like a sea can be rough. A PhD is not an intellectual challenge: doing something no one has done before means that even if you are dumb as a bell, you are going to move the needle forward. Actually most PhDs that I’ve seen were basically applying an existing method to a very similar problem, or marginally improving it. A PhD is a crash test of your personal fortitude. You will cry, and feel lonely, and consider destroying it all (be it suicide, drugs or moving to Peru and herd goats); you will do that again, and I haven’t seen anyone defend unless they were tired of <i>that</i>, not anything related to their research.<p>I didn’t finish it (weird circumstances in the definition of Economics and a topic that evolved a lot, turning an intellectual curiosity into something so controversial that the last e-mail I received about getting relevant data read: ”Do not try that. You will end in jail.”) but what I’ve learnt is priceless. It was a daily riot, but one that no-one could really ever understand. Finding an emotional connexion was… wild every time. Conferences are a very out-of-body experience because you meet people with the same sex-life as yours (none, because your significant other both works too much, like you, lives too far, like you, and has emotions you don&#x27;t relate to either). Also, they kind of get what you do, which is almost weird, and almost dirty, but not well enough for you to actually admire their comments, but then you make your own comments, and you realise how out of touch you both are with each other, and… it’s an odd connection. Think <i>Lost in Translation</i>, or actually most Wes Anderson’s movies.<p>Actually making a PhD is fairly simple. The needed contents are fairly simple -- it’s pretty much asking: is this true, finding a way to check it; making two related side-checks… and you are done. But reaching that can be surprisingly complicated, and therapeutic, and a shockingly bumpy ride.<p>My experience was a bit les typical because I’ve helped several dozen people go through it: being a one of the few statistician in the lab (and dating a medical student) meant I helped colleagues (and her friends). Plus I know how to use LaTeX quite well; it’s the software to type the damn thing; because Microsoft Word forfeits years before you are done. Yeah, because research is pretty much a parallel computing experience. I’ve been embedded in most PhD projects I’ve came across: people freak out a lot. They don’t know how to ask for help, and the impostor syndrome reaches somatic levels.<p>I’ve learnt to admire unconditionally some of the young assistants (the person helping you: imagine cynic seniors squared), their boundless dedication, their talent, their ability to repeatedly, mercilessly, shamelessly unravel, and destroy and rebuild someone by asking “And… So what?” only twice.<p>I’ve witnessed what ‘very senior academic’ means: politely listening; a pause of respectful and thoughtful silence when you are done; one question, one genuine, simple, almost-too-obvious-once-you-hear-it question. And three years of your life just exploded. Not sure if you are from a generation that spent their childhood watching the anime ‘Ken the Survivor’, but the guy Ken does karate, and he barely touches someone on seven spots, and nothing happens, but then they explode? Same thing, but with just one touch.<p>- “I’m not sure if I understand the role of repeated interactions in your model.” Hesitation… Boom. Three papers, four years of sweat… all to be entirely re-done.<p>- “Is your proposed scheme corruption-proof?” Kapooch.<p>It’s glorious, and necessary, and less painful if you apply large doses of alcohol to survive the blow.<p>There are things you can only learn with a PhD. I usually classify understanding and tuition in a simple way (self-education isn’t formalised, so it&#x27;s hard to fit but most examples match, time-wise):<p>* vocational studies tell you how to apply one set of tool;<p>* Master’s tell you how to choose the proper tool;<p>* PhD lets you invent your own tools.<p>I works for medicine, Arts and a couple of other areas.<p>It does make being told what to do suck a lot, lot more, though.",1395886409

The article is suggesting this is changing, valaraucal is disputing the premise of the article, that&#x27;s all.<p>Whereas the best chess engine is better than the best human, the best go engine can only beat a weak player with a big handicap. That&#x27;s all valaraucal was trying to say.<p>I&#x27;m a chess expert but not a go expert - I don&#x27;t know if valaraucal&#x27;s right - but I suspect he is overstating both the weakness of the player and the size of the handicap.<p>Worrying about cores etc is overthinking it, they don&#x27;t make that much difference (it&#x27;s not a linear problem). Houdini is much stronger (or at least has a much higher rating) than Magnus Carlsen, even on a commodity laptop.<p>Incidentally, if you build a chess engine from scratch, it will take a bit of effort to get an engine that can beat a 2100 player with a 2 bishop handicap. I am about 2000, I spent a couple of weeks building a toy engine (available on triplehappy.com, my website). It is rated about 1500, but it will still beat me if I don&#x27;t pay attention to the tactics. Illustrative of the fact that human ratings and machine ratings are not directly comparable.

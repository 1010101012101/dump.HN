Just a sub-feed which is the complement of what we have here. 1.News.YC. 2.Everything else.<p>""feel free to create a better one and ask us to migrate though.""<p>I was going to create one and post a message here inviting people. I thought this is a simpler way to solve this problem. So I am trying this discussion first. :) ",1183247499

You would share a dedicated subset of a search engine with your fellow Cthulhu programming language fans, one with your coworkers, another one with your family, with your bowling club, etc.<p>Google always searches the same, entire web whoever you are; maybe it is not the best solution?<p>Yes, whether it is P2P or not is not very relevant to this problem. On the other hand, P2P allows a not-for-profit, ad-free, ""do no evil"", privacy and freedom of speech friendly search engine (because the infrastructure costs would be shared between the users). I guess a big problem would be the latency.",1183245986

It would be very interesting and useful to find out what the start up folks are doing on a daily basis besides thinking about start ups. Like I said, this could be a very good inspiration tool.<p>Lisp was a landmark in my large scale understanding of computer science. I wonder what are the landmarks in understanding something like physics, or say bio-informatics. What are the problems that these people are facing? Hackers like learning just for the heck of it. In the process we can bring about useful start ups to these domains instead of making another calender application and stacking outside some big huge company in the hopes of being acquired.<p>I am not asking for a general news site. I am asking for a site where news.yc culture and outlook is preserved, but the domain is slightly relaxed (Note: the relaxing should stop well before we start seeing LOL(pic) in the submissions). If you won't keep the same URL, its ok, as long as you some how figure out how to set up that ""outlook"". ",1183245877

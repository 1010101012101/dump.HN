Essentially just a few extra header bytes to pad the zip container, ontop of the image content bytes that you will have to always send.<p>The use case you mentioned, of sharing the download link, works exactly the same. You send the link, and the what ever user clicks on the links gets an instant download.<p>True you are bufferring data through your app, instead of letting S3 take care of it. But if your on AWS, S3 to EC2 is free and fast (200mb/s+), and then bandwidth out of EC2 costs the same as S3. If it goes over an elastic IP, then a cent more per GB. You app servers also handle some load, but nodejs (or any other evented framework) live to multiplex IO, with only a few objects worth of overhead per connection.<p>In return, you can delete a whole load of cache and job control code.

As I respond to another comment in this thread, implicit in my statement is the belief that the universe is calculable on a Turing Machine. I do not believe this is wild speculation. These ideas are not simple for me at least so I will be careful:<p>If the universe is not calculable on a Turing machine then some physical processes including those going on in the brain are <i>not</i> computations but can only be expressed using superrecursive algorithms. If those processes in the brain were computations then the human brain would be a hypercomputer. I do not believe in the existence of that latter. This opens the possibility that even if the brain operates via non computable means, its behaviour could be fully captured by a Turing Machine. I also think the theory that the universe has non computable things going on and the brain harnesses them in a non algorithmic way is more complex than the theory that the universe is merely Turing equivalent and so is the human brain.<p>My basis for this belief is the unrelated fact that there are some strict limitations in reality. Finite Speed Limit, 2nd Law, Maximum Force, Maximum Information per square meter, Quantum Indeterminacy; Compuational Indertermincancy of various facets: Diophantine, Church, Godel, Turing, Chaitin. Also the prudent belief that P <> NP and more importantly, lack of any evidence of Nature doing P in NP.  Also: No Free Lunch in Search and its counter (okay no free lunch but the universe has structure exploitable by turing machines - see M Hutter). To me, saying the universe is just a turing machine fits this pattern.<p>Other patterns are the various links which occur in: physics, topology, logic and computation; the unifying power of category theory (e.g colgebras/algebras:objects---analysis as tagged unions---algebra), the link between physical and information entropy, the possibility of a Holographic Principle, the possibility of a discrete theory of quantum gravity, the relationship between a complex probability theory and Quantum Mechanics and the informational nature of QM. To me all these are very suggestive of a simple underlying nature which is informational and that digital physics may not be correct but it is in the right direction.",1332681891

Your source data is immutable and persistent as always.</i><p><i>Note in particular that transients are not designed to be bashed in-place.</i><p>The unique linear pointer would allow direct in-place mutation of the source. As it is guaranteed to be unique, no synchronization is needed. Transients do not modify in-place and do not allow you to mutate the source type directly, but allow you to <i>add to</i> the source and the <i>added</i> data is mutated directly for performance. There is a lot of overlap in use cases and transients are an excellent middle ground for Clojure, since it allows you to code against immutable types but with the performance benefits of partial mutation. The pointers I described would be less flexible in that you cannot have references to an immutable portion as you can in Clojure, but at the same time the owning code has completely mutable access.<p>In general, I love Clojures concurrency model and I don't think unique pointers would really mesh well with the rest of Clojure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clojure.org/transients"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/transients</a>",1332680923
3752489,comment,3750817,3752213,2,0,j2labs,,,"> The weakness of callbacks is the lack of multicore support.<p>You suggest that gevent won't work in preemptive environment if it wants to support multiple cores, alas I'm still not convinced as to why.<p>The greenlets are cooperatively scheduled coroutines, as we know, but with proper multicore support I don't see why they couldn't adapted to be preemptively scheduled. If we're imagining that Python now has multicore support, we can also imagine greenlets being updated to work with it. Assuming gevent would receive no modifications to work with such an important update to Python is why I accused you of speculating.<p>> It's because gevent context switches on I/O events, not preemptively, so you have some control over when context switches happen.<p>That's correct. They are cooperatively scheduled coroutines. If someone wants to context switch, they can write code that does it or wait for I/O events. The lack of an explicit yield statement does not prevent coroutines from switching. In fact, greenlets are quite powerful here, more powerful than what's offered by Twisted and Tornado, because they don't have to yield directly to the caller. You <i>could</i> imitate CPS which is impossible with the explicit context switch model.<p>I am not disagreeing with you on this point, btw, just trying to be more explicit for other readers about the <i>cooperatively</i> scheduled nature.<p>Interested readers might want to check this out: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking.2Ftime-sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Cooperati...</a><p>> I'm curious how large gevent code bases are in the wild<p>Well, eventlet itself was written to support Second Life and sits behind multiple big video games.<p>Gevent is in production use for many large companies, most notably Spotify. They are moving to gevent from twisted for performance and cleaner code.<p>> I didn't realize when I started using Erlang I signed a contract saying that. I also write Ocaml, so I guess any criticism I levy against Java is a product of that too, not rational thought.<p>My statement is facetious, but the reality is that Erlang got concurrency right and Python is trying to glue concurrency ideas into the language as an afterthought. If Python didn't have it's lousy GIL we wouldn't have to pull such tricks to work concurrency into a single threaded system. Alas, it has the GIL.<p>Now, to conclude some of my thoughts, I believe gevent is an excellent way to build web systems. The coroutines are short-lived, exist to fetch some data with an easy nonblocking interface and then concat some strings together to produce the web page / API output.<p>If folks were building CPU bound systems it would straight-up be a mistake to use Python for that. Ocaml could be a better choice, alas, as you say, it has the same issue with a GIL though the computations would execute a LOT faster.",1332680919

There are the obvious quibbles you get with any language, but for it's domain, it's the best bang for the buck.  Does that mean it's the only language in our stack? No.  But for my money, for the web side, it can't be beat.  If I were to do a site in a non PHP language, it would be Python hands down.  That being said, it all depends on what the project is, and what it entails.<p>Listen, I can't help but wonder if your imparting some past on the current crop of PHP developers (and by current, I mean those that moved to PHP5 some 8 years ago).  Maybe you had experiences with another group of people that focus on just one language.<p>The PHP community of today is far from that.  It's made up of practical people, who focus on more than <i>just</i> PHP.

Not that it's their only language.<p>To be honest, my personal experience is that everyone I've met who pans PHP and proclaims to have switched happily to Rails (because that's what they switch to first, never Ruby), or Python is that they needed the extra structure these languages enforced.

Only useful for number-crunching and GPU-like workload AFAIK.<p>2. Pre-compute time-consuming constants during compile time. Though I see no reason why you cannot do this in C.<p>3. JIT and runtime optimization. I doubt this though, given various overhead of JIT and runtime optimization (GC, memory, etc), that JIT can beat carefully crafted C. Of course it will make it easier to write many types of programs.",1332680459

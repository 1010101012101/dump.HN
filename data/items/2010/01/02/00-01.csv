Nabokov is very interesting to read. I like Speak, Memory<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Speak-Memory-Everymans-Library-Cloth/dp/0375405534/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Speak-Memory-Everymans-Library-Cloth/d...</a><p>and his essays on literary criticism (which I'm not turning up just now as I do an Amazon search, but which you should be able to find in a library).

1026525,comment,1025886,1025886,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> Code must always be ""self documenting""<p>This is in practice very hard to achieve. One reason is that a fully self-documenting name of a functiom might be rather verbose. I'll give an example based on code I'm currently working on. It contained this method definition (in Python):<p><pre><code>   def varGloLv(self, varp):\n</code></pre>\nClearly no-one looking at that on its own could tell what it does. What it in fact does is look up a variable, specifically a global one (""Glo"") withch is an lvalue (""Lv""). And the parasmeter is the variable name as a Python string. A more self documenting name might be:<p><pre><code>   def variableLookupGlobalLvalue(self, variableName):\n</code></pre>\nBut if I gave all my methods and variables such long names, the code would look terribly verbose and be hard to follow. So instead I use a comment that says what the method does, and specifies the type of its parameters and return value:<p><pre><code>   def varGloLv(self, varp):\n      """""" lookup a variable, that's global and an lvalue\n      @param varp [string] the variable name\n      @return [UBasicType] the value of the variable\n      """"""</code></pre>",1262393659

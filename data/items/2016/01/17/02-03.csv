Rust makes you put that in an unsafe block, to encourage you to build safe interfaces. This is a good thing.<p>> No name mangling.<p>The alternative to name mangling is not having a module system, with all the fun name conflict issues that come with it. Rust made the right decision here.<p>> No error handlers to override.<p>C has no concept of a panic handler because what would be panics in C are undefined behavior. Undefined behavior is bad for safety and understandability of the code. Having to declare an error handler is a small price to pay.<p>> It does seem odd to me that so many of what would be compiler options in C are hard coded.<p>Because Rust is safe by default. That&#x27;s one of its most important features. Being more like C in the ways you mention would mean compromising that principle.",1452999563

Once you pass a certain age, life becomes nothing more than a process of continual loss. Things that are important to your life begin to slip out of your grasp, one after another, like a comb losing teeth. And the only things that come to take their place are worthless imitations. Your physical strength, your hopes, your dreams, your ideals, your convictions, all meaning, or, then again, the people you love: one by one, they fade away. Some announce their departure before they leave, while others just disappear all of a sudden without warning one day. And once you lose them you can never get them back. Your search for replacements never goes well. It’s all very painful—as painful as actually being cut with a knife. You will be turning thirty soon, Mr. Kawana, which means that, from now on, you will gradually enter that twilight portion of life—you will be getting older. You are probably beginning to grasp that painful sense that you are losing something, are you not?&quot;<p>From 1Q84, Haruki Murakami",1452996112

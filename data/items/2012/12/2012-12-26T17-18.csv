I think that I'm one of those people. I lie awake at night sometimes very upset about how I'm running things and how I can't seem to do any better, no clue as to how to fix it.<p>> We get it wrong, as we have in the past, but, over the past 500 years, we've been, overall, getting better and better at it over time.<p>As an aside, that's kind of harsh to people of more than 500 years ago. It's easy to not have pity on people in the past for not knowing but they did the best that they could with what they had.

The best example is one where the new and essential product needed to avoid an m*n database transaction explosion, where m is the number of clients.  My warnings about this---and it was very easy to explain and the math is rather simple after all---kept me off that project and sidelined to a dead end.  The project ... went even worse than expected, was never reliable after the 2nd client logged in (the project manager had never even done a multiple client system before), until a new crew was hired to rewrite it, but it was a little late by then....<p>When Mr. Church say ""You get fired if you fail politically."" he's spot on.  That was obviously a factor these jobs and cost me another one or two.  All of these were small companies, except for Lucent during it's year of free fall from 106,000 employees to a targeted 35,000 or so; they ended up getting bought by Alcetal.<p>Here's a constructive comment (I hope): one thing you have to watch out for is managers who are failed programmers.

4970133,comment,4969372,4970015,1,0,betterunix,,,"""The use of pointers and direct pointer manipulation, for instance, can often be completely avoided with ease these days""<p>Really?  I am pretty sure there are a large number of STL implementations that give you a pointer when you ask for a vector iterator.  I suppose you could avoid iterating on vectors, but you would also have to avoid operator[] (which by default performs no bounds checking, so the pointer arithmetic is just as unsafe as it would have been with a primitive array type); you'd be stuck with at(), which few compilers will optimize even if it could be shown that the index will never be out of bounds.<p>""That cuts out a large number of potential problems""<p>Yet the language encourages programmers to do things the unsafe way.  It is a lot less effort to use a low-level pointer type, a fixed-width integer type, etc. than to use smart pointers, STL containers, iterators, Boost (which is not even standard), and so forth.  Just as an example, a C++ programmer must first choose between multiple smart pointer types (where should you break your pointer cycle with a weak_ptr?), whereas a primitive pointer is easily accessible and requires no decision-making (this was the pattern with casting:  C-style casts are much more convenient than static_cast, dynamic_cast, or const_cast, and so you saw C-style casts being used all over the place).  While a Java or Python programmer on a tight deadline might produce slow code, a C++ programmer will produce <i>unsafe</i> code that is far more likely to have bugs (even if the high-level design is bug-free).",1356544729

4970123,comment,4969041,4969041,30,0,michaelochurch,,,"Social status and being well-liked are different things, and sometimes you have to choose one at the expense of the other. It's not a comfortable feeling, but it's the truth.<p>Being accommodating lowers your social status but makes you well-liked. The end result of this is that people waste your time because they get away with treating it as having less value than theirs. But the default mode of most people is insecurity so, when the chips are down, they go with the high-status guy (the rival druggist who was not accommodating but prospered).<p>Respect, not popularity, is key. I spent many years of my life doing obnoxious, ridiculous things on the basis that it was better to be hated than ignored. I was completely wrong. Being hated or disliked is undesirable, if you can help it. Being ignored is fine. Being liked but not respected turns you into one of those whiny ""but I'm such a nice guy"" types, so it's the worst of all outcomes. Being liked and respected is what you want, but to get that, you have to accept the fact that some people will ignore or dislike you.<p>The reason it is better, in most cases, to be ignored than disliked is that it takes less effort. The same goes with being liked but not respected-- lots of effort. You should expend effort only for people who respect you. That's a chance to show true loyalty, not subservience. Subordinate people can never be really loyal, because power relationships always evolve and, when they do, their colors will change. So you only gain anything by doing someone a favor if you're already from a position of equality.",1356544563

4970110,comment,4968452,4968452,6,0,orangethirty,,,"Back when I started working on cars (like a million years ago) my dream was to build hot rod Ford Mustangs. I would devour every magazine or book that was about doing that (I still have a bin full of them). Why Mustangs? My brother loved them. He worked and worked and bought himself a pretty beat-up example (an '82 GT, which was slow as hell). In that car we had countless adventures that I still cherish to this day. Like that time we drove about 20 miles in around 5 minutes because the parts sotre was closing and we needed a part for a Corvette (another story altogether).
Or the time the crankshaft fell into the oil pan, thus leaving him stranded and engine-less (it was pretty funny).<p>So, I got into cars because i had a dream of modifying Mustangs. My brother had a friend who was a Racing mechanic that speciliazed in Mustangs. We hung out at his shop night after night. I kept learning how cars worked (I was around 13 years old), and how to modify them.<p>Years passed and I had turned into a walking Mustang library. I could quote the specs of every Ford Racing Camshaft (still can). I kept working on cars. Little by little I kept getting experience. But I was not getting any experience with Mustangs. Shoot!<p>Tinme passes by and I own a repair shop. Im a full fledged mechanic. Working on cars was <i>fun</i>, but it didnt make me happy. My dream was Mustangs, not Toyotas with a bad power steering pump. But I kept going.<p>After a while, I got the chance to work on Porsches. I quickly learned all about them and got into the art of modifying them. It was fun, but they were not Mustangs. Got as far as working with other high end Euro cars such as the BMW 850 V12 6-speed. Fine car. Sucky build quality.<p>Went back to fixing regular cars because I had to pay the bills. I still hadnt modified a mustang per se, but knew how to. I wanted to buy one of my own but could not afford it. There I was wanting to do something, and not doing it because I thought I couldnt.<p>Then my brother passed away. With him, my desire to build Mustangs went away. Turns out I just wanted to build Mustangs with <i>him</i>. You know, make him proud. At that moment I realized that we have to ask ourselves what do we want to do and do it. Instead of beating around the bushes, just go straight and do it. Life is too short to waste time on shit that doesnt make you happy.<p>Even though I dont know you, I can say the following. If you are tired of building bullshit applications at work, then quit. Save up some money, quit and take another job doing whatever it is you want. If you cant find a job doing just that then start your own company. Funding these days is easier to get than Malaria.<p>The problem is not CRUD apps (which I actually like doing), or algorithms. The problem is that you feel stuck. Un-stuck yourself by making a decision and sticking to it. It is better to make a bad decision and in the way fix it, than to wait until conditions are right (which they will never be).<p>I never got the chance to build that Mustang with my brother. You will never get another chance to write amazing software either. Carpe Diem, my friend. Carpe Diem.",1356544449

In fact I would expect most applications that use Riak or Cassandra are also using a general-purpose database as well (such as MySQL or Mongo). You could use some of those databases as a general purpose database but it would be more work for little benefit. It makes more sense to me to use Riak or Cassandra for use-cases that really need high-throughput and unlimited write-scalability and use an app database for things like user accounts and preference management and all the little things that can take up a lot of development time but will never have really demanding runtime requirements (for 99.99% of internet apps).",1356542726

For journalism, page views = ad views = revenue, so optimizing for anything else is folly. A short article with eye catching headlines and sensationalism is always going to outdo a great article like the OP. Any way to reverse this trend? Even pay-for journalism today is still plagued by 'page views', as no follow up article is going to be written if the views are low.

At this stage in its life can anyone with a straight face claim that Unity on 12.04 is a substandard experience? I highly doubt it, and if there is that person is most likely still holding on to the bitterness of their initial experience with it rather than any substantial criticism against how it is currently.<p>>> Clearly, the growth isn't there. Android has become the most popular Linux distribution around. DistroWatch shows more interest in Linux Mint, and a declining interest in Ubuntu. The general sentiment when following discussion online is that people are unhappy with Ubuntu, and trying alternatives, including Windows and OS X.<p>Saying that Android is the most popular Linux distro out there is grasping for straws, our discussion here is obviously in context of desktop OSs, bringing up Android is a non-sequitur and like comparing apples and oranges.<p>>> The same goes for Firefox and GNOME. The sentiment within the existing user communities is not pleasant. The only ""positive"" (more like non-negative) articles are coming from the leadership of these projects, and they often read much more like advertising or propaganda than informative articles. Much of the user-generated discussion is some expression of displeasure.<p>Once again this is all anecdotes. It's funny you mention Firefox, I use both Chrome and Firefox but the strongest criticism I see against Firefox is something as trivial as version numbers. In pretty much every Firefox related thread there is atleast one person complaining about the rate at which new versions are being churned out all the while not appreciating the irony of being a Chrome user and making that complaint. I read an article today with some guy ranting and leaving Ubuntu for Windows after his web-cam stopped working in a newer release, I consider this kind of trivial criticism to be irrelevant and sadly that's the kind of criticism that is directed at these projects these days.",1356541689

Not even Google, who once was quite vocal about hiring only graduates of top universities, can concern themselves about your education anymore. There are just not enough people to even start to be choosy.<p>Since I am not familiar with the employment landscape in the UK, I am going to have to take your word for the satiation there. However, since this article is US-based, I do not feel that your picture paints the employment situation in the US in the proper light. Formal education does not have that kind of relevance on the western side of the pond.",1356541340
4969906,comment,4969386,4969386,7,0,jashkenas,,,"Neat little implementation. A couple quick thoughts:<p>* Identity maps aren't a panacea -- If you're just getting started, and you don't yet know that you ""want"" an identity map, you don't necessarily need one. There are a bunch of situations where having the ability to model multiple versions of the same resource is useful. For example, an ""editing"" version of the resource with changes that may or may not be applied to the canonical version ... or a ""conflict"" version of the resource that has been changed on the server, that you can reconcile with the local version.<p>* Backbone Collections already maintain a map of id-to-model information for you, and you can rely on them as an identity map ... if you don't use ""new"". Instead, something like this:<p><pre><code>    Backbone.Collection.prototype.lookup = function(id) {
      return this.get(id) || new this.model({id: id});
    };

    // Then later, instead of `new` or `get`:

    Accounts.lookup(id);
    
</code></pre>
... would provide a simple implementation of the same behavior, without having to change the semantics of ""new"", or maintain an external id-to-object mapping that makes it harder for garbage collection to work later.<p>There's also a version of the above function that you can add that does ""lookup or fetch from the server"" -- another alternative is ""lookup locally, fetch from the server, or create on the server"". Whatever you need for your app.",1356541321

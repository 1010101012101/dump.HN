8801216,comment,8799504,8800868,0,0,lstyls,,,"I was a Software Engineering intern on an ads product team at Facebook last summer. My experience was almost exactly the opposite of what you assume here. Most people worked 7-8 hour days. I stayed plenty of late nights because I was dead-set on getting a full-time offer, but I was literally the only one on my entire floor most nights (including interns). On the off chance someone stopped in late and saw me, they were honestly shocked and insisted I go home.<p>The team working next to mine had a major product launch during the time I was there. A few of them (2 or 3) stayed in until 8 PM for the two nights immediate proceeding launch. That&#x27;s it.<p>One of the biggest surprises to me coming from undergrad was just how <i>little</i> the engineers worked at a company like FB. There is a pride in efficiency in the Facebook culture, and an working effectively is more valued than putting in long hours.<p>Of course, that was my experience on one team. I&#x27;m sure some teams work longer hours than others. That said, I think you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find an engineering shop that had a healthier work-life balance than Facebook. The idea that its a &#x27;meat grinder&#x27; is laughable. I saw another comment suggesting that FB employees leaving after 8-10 years is a sign of burn-out. Are you kidding? In this business 8-10 years is lifetimes.",1419641995

Even though some of them came to distrust Joseph Smith or consider him on a wrong path, once they had convinced themselves they had seen something miraculous happen they had a hard time letting go.<p>They later made comments that suggested they had seen the things &quot;in a vision&quot; (yet most people assume an actual witnessing), the important consideration is to them it was real, and just as valid as actually seeing it. In their mind there was no difference - so they had no problem claiming they saw it first hand.<p>Faith is a type of insanity, so naturally you can&#x27;t use the assumption of faithful people acting rationally (no motivation to die for a lie) to find truth.<p>As to how they came to believe it, again look at other religions, spiritual practices etc. It&#x27;s quite common for followers/believers to come to believe something the leader is not saying - <i>it has to be so</i>, that&#x27;s HOW IT WORKS.<p>It&#x27;s similar to snake oil salespeople today like Deepak Chopra - you just make a lot of hand wavy claims about energy and quantum physics and people inject their own meaning.<p>Put these in a time period when education and access to information was low and et voila.",1419641913

Nonetheless, this is a neat example.<p>> Back to my original question: does anybody know of a valid counterexample for the statement on countries?<p>A standard counterexample to the <i>hypotheses</i> of the 4-colour theorem (though not to the conclusion, as consulting a map easily verifies) is Michigan, which is not connected.<p>The 4-colour theorem&#x27;s hypotheses also rules out the possibility of 4 countries meeting at a corner (or, rather, declare that they don&#x27;t meet in that case).  If there were such an arrangement—and I&#x27;d be surprised if there isn&#x27;t; for 3 countries, one has the example of Finland, Sweden, and Norway—then it would be easy to juice it up to a counterexample.<p>Maybe the guy who established an island with a bizarre currency, including one coin that had a denomination of π (I can&#x27;t remember who—I thought Dean Kamen, but his Wikipedia page doesn&#x27;t mention it), could be induced to subdivide his island in such a way as to create a counterexample.  :-)",1419641599

The constant being asked to &quot;do things faster&quot; without caring about quality, then being blamed about quality at a later date that makes things fail. Trying to implement every single feature, rather than focusing on a small set of useful features.<p>In a word its management that makes projects fail. You need a system to set constraints on managament so they have to make proper trade offs and don&#x27;t expect everything in a small amount of time.<p>It&#x27;s easy to manage if you expect everything can be done. What makes management hard is making the trade offs because you have limited resources.<p>If you implement a standard way of doing things, you can stop management wrecking projects.<p>Boss comes in and asks to change something?

Probably when we get close to running out of money.<p>Old fashioned honest engineering is tossed out while the framework/technology of the month gets absorbed into this or that sprint cycle and when problems preventing what feels like forward motion are discovered, crap just gets thrown against the wall until something moves forward a step.<p>Things ship late, nobody can schedule anything, budgeting and hiring plans are a mess.<p>One of the defining aspects of being human is that we&#x27;re capable of thinking a few steps ahead and formulating a plan. The way Agile works in most shops returns us to being mere beasts of coding.<p>Of the places I&#x27;ve seen, the difference between success and endless-iteration-failure-followed-by-multiple-rewrites-from-scratch-before-delivery-because-look-at-all-the-lessons-we-learned-along-the-way is that somebody sat down before any work started and defined the goal, timing, budget and expectations.<p>There&#x27;s <i>some</i> planning, some mockups, some interaction prototypes, etc. at the start that&#x27;s <i>hard</i> work to do, but defines the goals and vision the work effort should be going towards...the &quot;shape&quot; of the work.<p>Goal driven development is something that seems to be missing in too many shops. It&#x27;s hard though, because you don&#x27;t want to end up in the waterfall trap again, but you don&#x27;t want to end up in an directionless iteration morass either.<p>It takes experience and lots of road miles to understand that balance and succeed.",1419640562

I present as a hypothesis that exploration is a form of competition, i.e. the most competitive societies explore the most.<p>As an example, the European Conquest of the Americas was driven by competition between European nation-states, it might not have occurred so swiftly or at all without some kind of competitive pressure.<p>Said another way, imagine yourself waking up in the court of  King James of England or Queen Isabella of Spain. You establish rapport and they believe you come from the future. You communicate faithfully what you know about history. What conclusion do you think they are more likely to reach?<p>1) They have done the right thing by colonizing the Americas.<p>2) They have created what will eventually become new competitors, of whom at least one (the USA) will have subjugated them under the disguise of an alliance called NATO.<p>In the crucible of 15th-century European politics, neither England nor Spain may have had much choice in their desire to acquire more resources and open new markets.<p>And maybe the 21st Century will have cheap space travel and good reasons to take the trip. But we shouldn&#x27;t ignore the possibility that Earth&#x27;s governments may just decide to not let anyone leave and blast anyone who tries. Let&#x27;s call it the &quot;Nitrogen Curtain&quot; in honor of Winston Churchill.",1419638476

The auction proceeds must go to the employee in question, with jail term for anyone trying to claw it back.<p>What this will do is drive the wages for the immigrant engineers ever higher, by extension raising the wages of Americans as well. It will also make sure only the best ones can be brought in, stopping the &quot;cheap import&quot; problem, and the higher wage will give the best incentive to come. Resultingly, foreign companies will be drained of talent, and American companies will become even stronger against weaker adversaries, and employing much of the best talent in the world.",1419638465

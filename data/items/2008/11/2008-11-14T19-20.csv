Worry about making something people want.</i><p>Constantly improving your product, for what your users want, <i>automatically</i> protects you against competition. I also find that worrying about competitors (instead of customers) can lead to a self-defensive mindset.<p><i>If [users] take you up, no competitor can keep you down.</i> <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html</a>",1226692624
364703,comment,364254,364694,0,0,palish,,,"Yeah, you're right.  I'm a big believer in ""pay it forward"" style gestures of goodwill.  If you contribute to others, you are generally rewarded for it in the long run (sometimes in unexpected ways).  That's happened to me enough times for me to believe that there is real value to be had in helping people.<p>But enough generalities.  Here are a couple reasons in favor of open-sourcing your project:<p>- Free bug fixes.  If a bug is affecting a number of users, then some users will at least feel like they can do something about it.  That is a very tangible benefit because there's no faster way to lose a customer than if they discover they can't use your product for some mostly-trivial reason <i>after</i> they dropped $50.  But for desktop apps, it's more likely that a user will just tweak the product slightly to suit them.  They might even have fun with it.<p>- Free marketing.  Even though the tech crowd is not nearly as massive as the consumer audience, techies are probably the most valuable type of customer.  They will help build a community around your product by answering other users' questions, for example.  And what better way to attract people like us than by offering us more control?<p>That said, the primary reason is to help people.  When I was first getting started with programming, it would have helped me tremendously to see how an ""industry-strength"" game engine worked, for example.  I personally like the idea that a novice might cut his time spent on learning down by half or more.  All they need are real examples to tweak and to build upon.  So if there aren't any reasons to keep source code secret, then I'm going to share it in the hope that it will inspire someone, somewhere.  How cool would it be to have access to all of Facebook's source code?  And Facebook wouldn't be endangered by that at all, because its value is in its content, not its source code.",1226692526

So even though Id did it after it generated a lot of revenue, they still did it, which is extremely rare.<p>Also, one reason that Id's most recent engine (Id Tech 5) is closed and licensed is because of its brand-new technology: MegaTexture.  As of now, no other engine has implemented that feature (or the engine isn't production-ready like Id Tech 5 is).

The source code is just the manifestation of those decisions. In other words, the product is valuable because of its design, not because of the source code that describes that design. Just because someone has access to a product's source code doesn't mean they can make valuable decisions about it.</i><p>That's the key insight of Peter Naur's classic article ""Programming as Theory Building"". (That's Naur as in BNF.) He starts with the question: why is it that code, even well-written code and even well-<i>documented</i> code (rare as that is) isn't sufficient to allow a new team to effectively take over development of a system? His answer: the program is not the source code, but rather a shared mental construct (he says ""theory"", you said ""design"") that lives in the minds of the people who made it. Source code is a textual representation of that construct, but it's a lossy one. So if you lose all the original people, it's hard to reconstruct the program.<p>Edit: I posted the article to YC ages ago but that link is broken.

I really respect what you have achieved with Ticketstumbler.<p>Yeah, people go to concerts to listen to good music.

What I'm saying is, that by itself isn't enough to be successful.  Because of your next point, actually:<p><i>I traveled 250k miles in the past two years and often found myself on no-name airline flights that I would have never heard of if it wasn't for Kayak.</i><p>That example is a very different from a preppy highschooler 
buying a ticket to a concert.  For one, you <i>had</i> to travel.  If all of a sudden there weren't any airplanes, it would still be necessary for you to travel.  But it's not necessary for people to go to concerts.<p>Also, consider the number one reason why people go to concerts: because their friends are going.  So one way to differentiate yourself from the competition might be to offer group discounts, for example.  You could even sell them at a loss for awhile, just so you can use that as a way to market Ticketstumbler.  Like ""Going out tonight?  Stumble into your next concert with Ticketstumbler.  The more friends you bring, the more cash you'll save.""<p>What I'm saying is, try not to hyperfocus on making Ticketstumbler like Kayak.  It isn't, and can't be.

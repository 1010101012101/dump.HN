This is an article whose intent is to polarize the community of haters and likers by comparing it to Apple.<p>There is really no comparison. The Tesla isn't a better ""car"" in the sense of how it gets you between a and b than the existing vehicles out there which are mature products that have been improved over time in the features and benefits that people care about. With Tesla you have to worry about distance, batteries, the high cost - I mean who cares if it accelerates as quickly as it does and who cares that there is no noise?<p>The potential market for products in the price category that computers are in is much different from cars.  Most people don't buy multiple cars and replacing one is a big decision to make. It's not like adding an ipod and an ipad.<p>Bottom line is what do I get by buying an Electric car exactly even assuming it is the same price as the gas vehicle? How important is the gas savings when you weigh that over the lack of utility in other areas?<p>I mean get real. Stuff like this will be a non-starter to most people:<p>""which will give you 150 miles of power in a 30-minute charge""<p>How many people are going to want to deal with that?<p>People buy cars on emotion not rationality.

Most likely life is outpacing ""your"" speed so lower the speed of life. You don't have to do N things, do N/2 things. It is OK to take breaks and not do anything for few days.<p>2. Most of the time, depression comes because of disappointment. It is good time to tell yourself that Life is unfair and move on.<p>3. Do not judge yourself too much, failures are fine. Everyone fails, it is just that they don't talk about it. Despite your failures, most likely, you are still doing better than majority of the people in the world.<p>4. Talk to people, most of the time, you just want someone around you to talk and may be take care of.<p>5. Learn new things and Find new hobbies, it often helps cheering you up.<p>6.

5691883,comment,5691570,5691570,1,0,opcenter,,,"Very interesting background and well written. My own schooling was more straightforward. I went through K-12 normally in (thankfully good) public schools in NJ and then got my BS in computer science at a relatively normal 4 year university. And I have to agree with you that none of that taught or encouraged self motivation. I always felt like I was just going through the motions to finish school and get to the real world.<p>Work after college didn't help either. All of the jobs I've had so far (going on 12 years now) have spoon fed me work to do and only my most recent job has given me any flexibility to be creative and solve problems that are beyond the scraps of work they give me.<p>Getting a taste of building something that I see a need for that wasn't just assigned to me has finally started me towards feeling some motivation to do my own projects on my own time and it feels really good. Over time I hope that I can expand this to my actual job and other parts of my life. I'm just a little sad that its taken me until my mid-30s to get this, so I'm glad to see you've figured it out as early as you have and I hope to help my daughter learn it early on. :)",1368301864

Just to give two examples, surely Office's switch to the Ribbon (and putting Office Apps online) was more speculative (or disruptive, or innovative, or whatever you want to call it) than anything being done by the open source office suites.  Likewise, Visual Studio 2010 represented a big break from the past with a switch to many managed APIs driving their extensibility story (including the move to WPF for their UI), which was a huge change from their existing COM APIs.<p>Not all commercial projects are run like Windows, and it seems to me that most of their conservatism doesn't come from lazy or shoddy or shortsighted developers and managers, but rather their large number of hardware and software partners who take dependencies on undocumented implementation details (see Raymond Chen's blog for a virtually infinite supply of such anecdotes).",1368301566

5691843,comment,5691250,5691790,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nitpicking is good, it helps to clarify the conversation.<p>So my reference to refueling was around the time issue the GP mentioned, typical electric vehicles take a lot of time to transfer the same number of joules of energy that a gasoline car can transfer in a couple of minutes. That said, lets look a bit more at your concern.<p>You wrote : <i>""only because electric power transmission is a damn-hard problem to solve at a global scale.""</i><p>You are absolutely correct that a generalized solution for global power distribution of electricity is an unsolved problem. However you must be careful applying the general problem to a more specific case. Car charging has some nice features, one you can start and stop the electricity to it over the course of a charge and it won't notice (it will just take longer), its a constant load vs a varying load. These two aspects of it combine to make some creative solutions possible. One of them is fuel cell recharging.<p>Fuel cells can generate energy reliably from hydrocarbons but they really don't like rapid changes in load, they are most efficient when they can deliver a steady stream of current. So from an engineering perspective you could build a fuel cell based 'supercharger' type station, where you pour in 10 - 20 gallons of gasoline and plug in. Finesses both the long distance transmission of power and the availability. But its just one of a number of creative ways to fuel cars which want electricity rather than gasoline.<p>One of my favorite nuclear power 'hacks' was to build a 10GW nuclear plant in the middle of the desert, and next to it build a solar panel plant. Using using power (and heat) from the nuclear plant you melt silicon, refine it into crystals, smelt aluminum and build solar panels which you then truck off to places that need power. You are essentially putting the scary nuclear plant far from humans in a place they don't want to live anyway, and making a way to generate power which you then transport to places where you want power.<p>If you put enough solar panels in your village in Nairobi to charge up your Tesla truck over the course of a week then once a week used your truck to carry goods from the village into the city, I still think that would be a benefit to the village, but I cannot prove that.",1368301202

If you look around here, a lot of the launching pads and site layouts are incredibly simple, but the simplicity, along with some fancy fonts, and well sectioned contents, make them nice to look at (though a bit cookie cutter).<p>A bit more on the design of the front page -- I realize header bars are a little boring and over done, but you guys probably want one. and having login be a dropdown would definitely save you some space up there.<p>Getting an account should be something in Bold print, not just under there, sort of hiding. The tag line to the right on the navbar you have there, should really go under or near your logo, since that's one of the first places that people look when they go to a website (top left -- theres some research on this, but I am too lazy to go find it)<p>Also, That navbar as a whole is kind of placed awkwardly in the middle of the page... I think you would do well to expand it to the whole page, or something.<p>As far as the area with the map, this bootstrap template (<a href=""http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/examples/carousel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/examples/carousel.html</a>) could help a bunch. Not that you have to use the carousel, but I think you would benefit from putting that map on some sort of blurred out picture of people working or something (which could even be carouseling), and next to it (like you have now) you can put a ""Look for jobs now!"" tag line with the search bar, and put the results there, etc.<p>I think the ideal place to put things like a huge sign up button would be under the results (or maybe in it's own row right under), and that's where you can also put the ""Looking for employees""/""employer?"" button also, which will take them to the info/pricing page.<p>The bottom part with the three columns of information goes wwell with the example templates bootstrap has on their site, as well as a bunch of landing pages that are out there:\n<a href=""https://www.gathercontent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gathercontent.com/</a> (example from bootstrap, you can find a bunch of pages like this/better on HN, as you already know -- just search ""Show HN:"" or something)<p>Basically, your site is just a tad too plain for my tastes at the moment, given how awesome what you're doing is -- and how big it could get.<p>As far as functionality, I'm in Austin, TX, and searching didn't quite work. You guys probably have a handle on that, but what I want to say about it is that when things DON'T work out, and no jobs are found, or it doesn't know where you are (which you should take care of, like if I'm not sharing my location, it should maybe default to somewhere, or ask me?), a non-intrusive modal (which might be an oxymoron... just maybe at least over the map, letting me know nothing was found, rather than the head turn to the right side of the page.<p>Just had a thought -- What if you overlaid the results, and maybe even the search onto the map? You could get space for a bigger map, have search on the top, results at left (I would prefer left, since that's where people's eyes tend to drag over) -- and dim anything that isn't in focus/use?<p>This is all in my opinion, most of it isn't even about functionality, but if you're looking for places to go, get the design devs to at least think about these changes, I think they'd add a level of polish that your site would benefit from...<p>It's true that it's the functionality that matters, but I think some style and a little UI changes would do wonders<p>Also, I'm not sure you've thought of this -- but log EVERYTHING, in the most inexpensive way possible. If your site takes off (and by takes off, I mean over 10 users), logging things like how long people connect, where they search, and trying to discover facts about your users will make you much more than just a job classifieds page. And it will also help you make a better business.",1368299209

Because, as I said, there aren&#x27;t many (should I say &quot;any&quot;?) successful apps written in it, so it&#x27;s a little hard for unenlightened people like me to grasp how good it is.<p>Yes, I know that writing a browser or anything serious is a lot of work. But it&#x27;s productive, right? And quite many people do that in their free time… well, maybe not a browser (at least I haven&#x27;t heard about that), but at least bittorrent clients, p2p network layers, feature-full messaging clients, firewalls, anything. Their authors started them alone in their spare time, for free. And they are written in C, C++, Python, sometimes Java. Why? Obviously, because their authors for some reason chose that language. They decided it&#x27;s <i>better</i>. And nothing is written in Haskell. It was like that 5 years ago, Haskell evolved, became much more popular (actually I even <i>do</i> know a company that uses it in production, but it&#x27;s not the point) and that statement is still true. So every time somebody starts bragging about how all-powerfull Haskell is and how stupid are people that actually write something to choose C++ instead, I can help but ask: so why won&#x27;t you prove on practice that Haskell is better? Because, once again, for PL &quot;to be better&quot; is to make its user more productive and more able to write quality software. So, it seems to me that this &quot;why won&#x27;t you…&quot; argument (which is pretty ugly in many cases) is fair enough in this case.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to rewrite what I said about languages you mentioned, because it was pretty long. So, in short. ML — dead. Python — way too slow (if &quot;browser&quot; is everything including engine, not some shell around webkit). Erlang — just isn&#x27;t built for that purpose (it&#x27;s dynamic, highly concurrent &quot;built to fail&quot; language — are you even serious?!).

At the time it was difficult to assess the validity of that claim. It’s been bolstered, however, by a Reuters report earlier Friday stating that Malaysian military radar showed the flight following a course westward over the Malay peninsula and then heading out over the Indian Ocean, passing specific navigational waypoints as it went.<p>According to the report, this latter portion of the flight followed an unusual zigzag trajectory as it worked its way toward the north and west. This is a very inefficient way to get from one place to another, but it had some consequences that may have been useful for whoever was in control of the airplane. For one thing, by navigating between well-traveled waypoints, the plane would have seemed to military radar operators to look just like all the other well-behaved commercial traffic traveling over that stretch of ocean. “That’s going to seem like unsuspicious traffic,” says Maarten Uijt de Haag, a professor of electrical engineering at Ohio University. Had the plane left the well-traveled routes and struck out on its own, it would have been far more conspicuous.<p>Another consequence of the zigzagging trajectory is that, like a fox crossing back and forth over a stream to eluding a pack of hounds, it obscured where exactly it might be heading.</i><p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/14/mh370_disappearance_if_the_malaysia_airlines_plane_isn_t_in_the_indian_ocean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/14/mh370_dis...</a>",1395052383

Where do you put these &quot;constructor/destructor&quot; functions? In the global namespace? So you have structs, and functions that modify structs. How is this pattern different from the one we call &quot;programming in C&quot;?",1395050981

7414101,comment,7411806,7412377,2,0,Nux,,,"Fair points.<p>1. If you need to restart your server because patches, then you restart it. :)<p>2. Backups: AFAIK you can simply just backup /home/user that runs GitBucket. &quot;To upgrade GitBucket, only replace gitbucket.war. All GitBucket data is stored in HOME/.gitbucket. So if you want to back up GitBucket data, copy this directory to the other disk.&quot;<p>3. &quot;Since it&#x27;s Java ... therefore security&quot; yeah, you need to keep it updated, same goes for ALL software. Luckily I&#x27;m using an enterprise class distro which provides timely security updates and pays particular attention to Java (RHEL/CentOS).<p>Nothing is ever &quot;simple&quot;, but running stuff yourself is not as hard as many people think, you just need to get a bit involved.",1395050927

7414098,comment,7412612,7413519,7,0,pron,,,"It is sad that some people dispute the existence of sexism in tech, but that does not make it controversial in the sense that it is contentious, because it isn&#x27;t. The facts are simple: 1) technology is a big source of power in our society, and 2) women are underrepresented in tech. Whenever a well defined group of people is absent from (or underrepresented in) a source of power, discrimination is taking place, period. Sexism, like racism, is a loaded word, and people often believe that malice is required for it to exist, but that is not the case. Whether sexism begins in kindergarten or in mens-club startups is, at this point, secondary. It is there and we <i>must</i> address it.<p>In the case of GitHub specifically, the issue is even clearer. This is a company that for years had a blog with little else than their drinking escapades. Perhaps that&#x27;s changed, but the burden of proof is on them.<p>The only thing that is up for dispute is whether this <i>particular</i> case is an example of sexism in tech or not. We can&#x27;t be 100% sure, but at this time it&#x27;s safer to assume that the weaker party is right, if only because the stronger party can handle a quick-to-judge public much more easily than the weaker party. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s boycott time, but it&#x27;s best to at least open the discussion with that assumption in mind. Again, the burden of proof is on GitHub.",1395050896

I am working on it for like 16 hours a day and in 3 days have brought it to level which was expected to be in 15 days. I made it 18 hours yesterday thanks to the comments like &quot;phenomenal work&quot; from my employer/mentor.<p>Side effects? My head is feeling numb. It&#x27;s the same feeling as you have when sitting crossed legs and your feet go &#x27;sleep&#x27;, when you can&#x27;t feel you have feet and there&#x27;s no feeling of pain on pinching them. Also I am finding it harder and harder to think deep. I could collect great level of detail earlier, but now I feel like my head is refusing to think. I thought it was just another level of boredom as I haven&#x27;t seen daylight for last 3 days. I thought my brain is behaving strange because it&#x27;s tuning itself for more optimal performance. But F<i></i>k performance, I didn&#x27;t realize things can get as wrong as the OP says.",1395050872

Then I happily installed arch, everything worked fine (even though the double-bootloader, i.e. UEFI->grub->linux still makes me queasy).<p>The only trouble was when afterwards I tried installing windows. At least at the time, windows 7 DVDs weren&#x27;t able to boot in UEFI mode, therefore weren&#x27;t able to use the GPT-partitioned hard-disk. The fix was easy enough at least - just copy the bootloader to the correct location on the DVD and it boots just fine.",1395050815

This type of illness is rare.<p>We do not reduce stress in the workplace to reduce the incidence of very rare illness, although that&#x27;s a useful side effect.<p>We reduce stress in the workplace to increase productivity and quality, and to reduce the incidence of much more common stress related mental health problems.<p>It is disappointing to see that a company chooses to fire a previously productive employee because that employee had some time in hospital.

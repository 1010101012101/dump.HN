3302341,comment,3301540,3301540,1,0,YmMot,,,"It's nice to see some critiques of CoffeeScript from an actual user, and not just speculation about why it might be bad...however some of the criticisms strike me as the product of not understanding CoffeeScript and/or not sharing it's philosophy/principles/etc. The author seems to have not totally familiarized themselves with CoffeeScript, and seems to think it's ""Ruby and JavaScript's love child"" which it is decidedly not. It's totally valid to not share the philosophy, I just think it's important to judge it on those terms.<p>> ""->"" wtf? why?<p>Not liking the arrow; fair enough...personal opinion and totally valid, but I think it deserves commentary. What's wrong with ""function""? Way too long and cumbersome. Maybe it's the Lisper in me but ""def"" is not specific enough for my tastes.<p>I like the use of a symbols because it pops in my eyes. It also provides a nice opportunity for features like the fat arrow (=> for binding to the current context) which would be more difficult/less elegant if something like ""function"" was used. Also note this particular syntax has precedent in other languages.<p>> Plus syntax highlighting goes to pot when you use the coffee way.<p>Not really sure what the author means here. Syntax highlighting works just fine for me with CoffeeScript. I suspect they have some problems with some particular editor or feature not working correctly with CoffeeScript, but overall I haven't had any problems with it.<p>> You'd expect this:<p><pre><code>      x = true  x? ""Badger"" : ""Fish""\n</code></pre>\nto return badger, right?<p>Not really. To be honest I'm not sure what this code is supposed to be. I'm guessing that the ""true"" is just some sort of typo/copy-paste error, in which case it's not valid CoffeeScript. (Coffescript's succinct syntax makes the ternary ? unnecessary and ? is used as the existential operator)<p>In CoffeeScript it would be:<p><pre><code>    x = if x then ""Badger"" else ""Fish""\n</code></pre>\n...which will behave exactly as you expect. The author mentions this, but says it should generate a syntax error. As written it does, if written as I suspect they meant...it doesn't but I don't know if it's entirely fair to expect a syntax error for every single nonsensical (but mostly syntactically valid) construct in a language.<p>I think their larger point stands though; there are a lot of things in CS that don't generate a syntax error that probably should. This is mitigate by the fact that once you learn CoffeeScript you're less likely to make these sorts of errors, and that a lot of them will cause syntax or obvious errors in the generated JS. (still it would be nice to catch them ASAP)<p>>  Closure. This has caused a world of pain, given every coffee file is compiled within a closure, it takes some hacking and extra work to use modularity with ease<p>This I can't really get behind. Wrapping everything in a closure is a sane default IMHO. If you have a lot of scripts, it's trivial to turn it off and then handle it in the build. Even with the wrapping, it doesn't strike me as had managing it...but that may just be a product of how I tend to structure my projects: There's generally a master file that creates the namespaces for the project, then any loaded modules attach to that. Others may find the auto-wrapping interfere with their structure, fair enough.<p>> I really like Chrome's JS debugging feature... yes, you can sort of work out which line relates to which, but when you're fixing a bug this becomes more difficult.<p>Another common criticism, and one that's generally fair. This is one that should get better with time, as support increases. In the mean-time I find that this issue is mostly problematic for people who aren't totally familiar with CoffeeScript yet. After you become comfortable with it, it sort of fades into the background. As you write the CS you know what JS it will generate. Everything maps pretty closely.<p>For me personally, I find that the types of things I am debugging have little to do with the CS/JS translation. They're usually logic errors, problems with some API I'm using, etc. In those cases I don't need to muck around with the translated code...I just add some logging/tests to my CoffeeScript or step through the JS and watch local variables.<p>If I need to find out that I misspelled the name of some API call... I don't really need to figure out what JS corresponds to what CS. I just see what the exception says, realize the problem, and change the CS.<p>Anyway, this sort of feedback from the trenches is invaluable. It's not my intention to try and write off these criticisms. CoffeeScript definitely has issues and we need discussion about them to fix them.<p>I just thought I'd offer some counterpoint in case others who have no experience with CoffeeScript happen to read this, so they can hear some from someone who has been using CoffeeScript a lot and had a mostly positive experience.",1322790970

3302321,comment,3301667,3301667,2,0,smerritt,,,"I voted for option #3; I recently tried to work with a technical recruiting agency, and based on my experience, I don't plan on ever doing it again. They were a bunch of email-phobic telephone-happy people who just flung every job in their database at me regardless of what I told them I wanted. A simple keyword-matching algorithm would have been an improvement.<p>The long version:<p>It started with a phone call one day; I was very discontented at my (then) job, and I'd contacted a couple of companies on my own already. I got a cold call from a recruiter, and instead of my usual please-go-away response, I decided to see how working with a recruiter might be. I'm already job-hunting; what's the worst that can happen? So, I asked this person (call them Alice) to please email me over some information about jobs they knew about that fit my skill set, and then I hung up.<p>The next day, instead of an email with jobs in it, I got an email from Alice asking to set up another phone call. I wasn't too happy about this, since I worked in a small, open-plan office and there was no place to make a quick phone call without being overheard, and I didn't want to open that can of worms with my (then) boss. I explained this, but Alice insisted on a phone call, and I caved in.<p>A few days later, I phoned Alice from a nearby coffee shop (for privacy from my boss). We went over my resume, which was online already; we talked about what kind of jobs I wanted, which I had said before in an email; and Alice said she'd forward my resume on to her colleagues.<p>Now, I'd thought that since Alice was a recruiter, she'd forward my resume to people with open positions to fill. Not so! This recruiting agency had two parts; recruiters like Alice who went out and found candidates, and other recruiters who worked with hiring managers. Alice had just forwarded my resume to all the hiring-side recruiters. The next morning, by the time I got to work, I had emails from Bob, Carol, Dave, Edna, Fred, and George. Each email talked, in the vaguest possible terms, about ""exciting opportunities"" with ""awesome companies"". And each one wanted me to set up another damn phone call.<p>As if that wasn't annoying enough, four of them had also left me voicemails telling me that they'd sent me email asking to schedule phone calls. In case I'd forgotten how to read, maybe?<p>Bob wouldn't talk via email; I tried, but he just wouldn't do it. I told Bob that I wanted a job that let me telecommute a day or two per week; he told me that no really profitable company ever let its employees telecommute, but he'd dig around his B-list and see what he could dredge up. Gee, thanks, jerk. Strike one.<p>Carol also wouldn't talk via email. I told Carol that I wanted a job that let me telecommute a day or two per week; she introduced me to a hiring manager who said, in no uncertain terms, that telecommuting would never happen on his team. Strike two.<p>Dave would use email, but he kept sending me job after job with no relation to my skills or what I was looking for. Strike three; I'm out. The rest of them were no better anyway.<p>In the end, it was a big waste of time. Every job they sent me was also posted on the company in question's web site as well as Github Jobs, Craigslist, or some other job board. All the recruiters did is burn up a bunch of my cell minutes and raise my blood pressure.<p>(Happy ending: I wound up finding an awesome job by talking to some former coworkers of mine.)",1322790446

3302287,comment,3295007,3295007,1,0,scubaguy,,,"> Instead of the http server being an external service that we configure to run our code, it becomes just another tool in our arsenal.<p>This is unfair. If I create a framework cal Java.js and make it possible to create a httpserver by running server.start(8080, aCallbackObject), does that make Java great? One day someone might make node.js ""configurable"" via a configuration file (that is not written in JavaScript). Will having a configuration file make node.js less useful?<p>> Note also that the http snippet from earlier isn't inheriting from an http.Server base class or anything of the sort.<p>That is also unfair. You typically don't use inheritance in JavaScript because you can compose objects or clone from a prototype. There is no static analysis of classes, which in the main benefit of classical inheritance. Programming via callbacks is simply the JavaScript style. This might even change when the language provides better support for classes, or when more people write their node.js code using CoffeeScript.<p>> If software ecosystems are like economies then core libraries are at best government bureaucracies and at worst nationalized state corporations.<p>This is very subjective and I strongly disagree. There is a great advantage in using a language and framework that has a strong core library and a common way of doing thing, especially when you start building teams or start recruiting people to maintain legacy code. If anything, Node should start including more batteries, such as a module for concurrency.<p>PS - Here's the thing. I am really excited about the event driven nature of node.js and the community. However, I am new to node.js and I want to see quality critical analysis of its strength and weaknesses. If you are going to tell me its great, you better have pretty solid reasons.

Let's play devil's advocate. I think the following are at least somewhat true statements:<p>1) most vacancies are for run-of-the-mill jobs. Hence, the average recruiter has more of those vacancies than those that would help ""building a relationship"". Chances are even that most recruiters have only run-of-the-mill jobs on offer. Given that, they cannot afford to spend much time aiming precisely. So, they use buckshot instead.<p>2) if a recruiter finds you a job you like, you should be off the market for years (freelancing excluded). If a recruiter needs to land x jobs per year, and people stay in those jobs for y years on average, he needs a) x good vacancies per year, and b) relationships with about x times y good developers. I do not know what are realistic values for x and y, but I guess x cannot be much smaller than 25 (otherwise, one could easily run for a month without placing somebody anywhere. That probably would upset his boss, or worry the self-employed recruiter), and y probably would be around 5 years or more. So, a 'good' recruiter would need a relationship with over 100 people. Once one knows those people, that is doable (working full time, that is about two hours a month per person to keep up with LinkedIn profiles, blogs, whatever), but finding them in the first place will be a challenge.<p>3) it may be more profitable to get a good relationship with employers than with developers because those employers will bring in the vacancies without which you cannot do anything.<p>4) pay for typical recruiters may be too low to attract people with the combination of technical and social skills needed to do the job well.",1322788625

Sure, the community might not have the knowledge necessary to improve your drivers, but then no harm done. Drivers might be taken in directions you don't want them to go? These companies release new chips multiple times per year. With them come new drivers. Who cares what directions the old drivers take?<p>And furthermore, chip companies might just get free driver debugging. That makes their chips look better. It makes them look better. More sales.<p>Is there any possibility that the real reason for the lack of open-source drivers, is that in many cases ""different"" graphics chips are essentially the same, and what you're really paying for with the more expensive ones, is a driver that enables high-end functionality?

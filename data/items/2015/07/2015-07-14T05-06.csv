If I understand correctly, double taxation in a C-Corp wouldn&#x27;t become an issue unless you have extremely large profits and want to take a large chunk of it out of the business, so much that you can&#x27;t justify the amount as a salary and need to pay yourself a dividend. Or maybe if you have shareholders who are expecting to be paid dividends.<p>I am leaning towards forming a C-Corp.<p>Is there anyone who has been in a similar position who can share some advice?",1436851915

I have created something I believe to be innovative and have a prototype ready to go. Unfortunately, I am also currently living in NYC- -and have already been burned a couple of times by NYC salesmen-types on business ventures in the past, and am also out of favor with the NYC VCs as well, due to my having been arrested on a possession of weed charge 5 years ago while I was in a car with 5 other people in the deep South—and then thrown into solitary confinement for a week due to a clerical error by my probation officer a few years back as well.<p>I consider these experiences to be character building but the VCs in NYC  were so appalled by my mistakes and indignity that I was basically forced out of the company I founded.  I am  in the process of moving to California in the hopes of finding some more like-minded people to be around. However, I don&#x27;t actually know anyone out there and am really just assuming this on the basis of common stereotype.<p>The questions I had were: do VCs on the West Coast tend to be more forgiving about these sorts of non-violent brushes with the law  than other places (like NYC)? Or would partnering with someone who is a bit more clean-cut be a wise move regardless of my location? Will I likely run into the same issues I ran into in NYC in California regardless?

Gas is highly regulated in the U.S. and supposedly a Mom & Pop gas station&#x27;s gas is just as good as Shell or Chevron..(because they are inspected yearly by the local county&#x27;s Weights and Measurements department) But the price difference can be quite large, e.g., 15%+ higher sometimes.

In fact it is being expected from every leader who made mistake like Japanese want CEOs to publicly cry. The problem with this whole new fashion is that these tears/&quot;I screwed up&quot; emails are often empty and/or has no objective value other than asking for forgiveness. These emails are starting to almost look like template without any actual retrospection about real root causes and what someone else should do differently in future. In 42floors post, that&#x27;s exactly the problem: there is absolutely no retrospection about what he could have done differently or what others should do differently. It&#x27;s just plain and simple &quot;I screwed up/it was the hardest thing/it hurts my heart&quot; template. It&#x27;s almost as if these leaders are suggesting that it was just bad luck, here&#x27;s my tears and now let&#x27;s move on. While all these regret and emotions are commendable, I fail to see single thing that CEO has mentioned as his learning on what he could have done differently. From his post my interpretation was that they hired whole bunch of guys to execute on single strategy, without long term feasibility and without disclosing the risk that failure of that one strategy would mean loss of jobs.

When you start a big project, you know that at some point -- maybe even four or five years hence -- you will need a hack around language semantics to solve something without rewriting the whole thing. Python has monkeypatching, Ruby has meta-programming, C and C++ hack themselves, Rust has unsafe and C, and Java has bytecode instrumentation (load-time *or build-time) and Unsafe. With Go, you have absolutely nothing. You can&#x27;t even drop down to C to get around semantics issues because you&#x27;ll probably mess up the runtime. Every language has an escape hatch from factory-settings semantics. It&#x27;s not wise to use it often, but sometime in the life of a big project, you will need it. Except Go. Go is utterly unhackable (at least not in any safe-ish way). The only &quot;escape hatches&quot; are source instrumentation and taking your chances with mucking about the runtime in C. But those are more taking a sledgehammer to the wall (and are available in any other language, too) than escape-hatches. It is very clear that Go is tailored to match Google&#x27;s very specific process, like being very source-code- (rather than binary-library) -oriented.",1436850316

It would be really nice to have a feature where instead of a popup alert, the visor window would just slide out, to let me know that it&#x27;s done.<p>But all in all, sounds like an awesome set of features, will have to try tonight. Thanks!<p>PS: On an unrelated note, if later on you could add native support for pop out window to appear in full screen apps, and maybe do a check, so that if you are in full screen app mode, it pops over with 0 y offset, but if it&#x27;s in a norma screen, it pops up with offset to accommodate the menu bar, that would be awesome. But no rush :), thanks for all the awesome work!",1436850045

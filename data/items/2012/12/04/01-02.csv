Old Windows boxes getting lightweight Linux distros provide a lot of machines for students, schools, people without cash, giveaway machines for friends, elderly relatives in need, etc.<p>Making that process harder (e.g., shim required) probably means more machines will just go to the trash (unless the shim is widely incorporated in lightweight distros maybe).  What a waste (at the very least, of time).",1354586394
4869125,comment,4867216,4868305,3,0,_delirium,,,"This is partly a symptom of poor rules imo. American wants to have two things at once: 1) a bunch of very detailed CYA safety rules; but 2) not to take the financial hit that would be needed to actually implement those rules faithfully as written. This works so long as employees are willing to turn a blind eye to the rules, treating them as the not-really-intended-to-be-enforced CYA rules that they are, but runs into trouble once someone takes them seriously.<p>The solution, not that likely to happen, would not be to write rules that you don't intend to budget the staff/time to actually follow as written.",1354586393

The incoming branch is from the front of the planet, the outgoing branch is also in the front of the planet.  So you go from moving backwards to moving forwards.<p>However the planet is moving in the reference frame of the Sun.  The initial ""moving backwards"" is actually more like ""sitting there"".  The ending ""moving forwards"" is actually something like, ""moving up to 2x as fast as the planet"".<p>So a gravity boost only looks like a gravity boost in a reference frame that is moving relative to the object.  Furthermore the gravity boost also does nothing to help you to escape from the object you're getting the gravity boost from.<p>Therefore we cannot get a gravity boost from the Sun to leave the Solar System.  And a gravity boost from the Sun does not look like a gravity boost to us, in orbit around the Sun.",1354586348

The settlement date is not the same as the 'hold' date, they may release funds prior to the settlement date if you are a good customer, with the understanding that if the check is subsequently refused by the originating bank, or is shown to be invalid, the deposit will be reversed.<p>The most common scam that trips people up is the 'over amount' check where a ""cashiers check"" for more than the amount purchased is sent with the instructions to deposit the whole thing and just send back another check with the overage. When the check finally 'bounces' the check sent has already settled and you're out the amount of the overage (and possibly the item).<p>In this way writing a check is exactly the same as handing the person cash, once both banks agree the funds from one is in the other and the accounts are all updated, assuming it wasn't in error, and the other party doesn't have special privileges (there is an exemption that governments can pull back funds) the only way to reverse that transaction is a lawsuit.

Unfortunately, people in low population density areas are kind of screwed without an online marketplace.<p><i>2) Block all buyers from countries other than your own.</i> In massive markets like the US, gaining a few more potential buyers is not worth the increased risk of fraud or loss during shipment. Perhaps in smaller countries this rule won't work as well.<p><i>3) Only sell to people with significant positive feedback.</i><p><i>4) Only ship to CONFIRMED Paypal addresses.</i><p><i>5) Require Signature Confirmation for items over $250.</i><p><i>6) Don't accept PayPal; require money orders for payment.</i> This might scare off potential buyers.

This is a 2-building apartment complex (with about a dozen condo units in the front) with about 500ish total residents.  When my folks sold their home a few years ago and moved in, no one else on their floor (two buildings, three floors each) owned a computer, and many never had owned one in the past.  My parents today are still on the younger side of the spectrum (57 and 63), so we're talking about a population whose kids went off to college or moved out in 1992 or earlier.<p>However, there was a desire amongst people they met to own one as they were aware of what could be done, they just didn't want to deal with the hassle.  My mother (a textbook technophobe) showed folks her Kindle, and people in the community felt that was easy enough to deal with (especially when getting to a library in the sticks can be a hassle).  As a result, my parents helped get folks set up with 3G Kindles.  My parents bought themselves iPad 2s about 18 months ago.  My father, unlike my mother, was comfortable around computers, but his computer/iPad usage shifted to 10/90% after about 3 months.  My mother was initially more 70/30, but is now more along the lines of 20/80.  As of right now, they have no intention of replacing their computer with another one.  Moreover, my mother who was always paranoid of someone ""messing up"" the family computer 15-20 years ago is eminently comfortable with her iPad.  An even weirder outcome is she apparently follows Apple product news a bit, as do one or two of her aged 55-65 friends.<p>The new thing?  The septuagenarians and octogenarians are now getting iPads.  They're buying an Airport Express, calling Comcast to get internet access, and the iPad is the first computer they've ever owned.  And they're pretty chuffed about it.  And using them.  Significantly.  Do you have any idea how fantastic the idea of HD FaceTime is to grandparents who almost never get to see their grandkids (and that they'll use it every chance they get)?  When I mentioned LetterPress to my mom, the next time I talked to her she mentioned how big a hit it was at her community.<p>I think to date my parents have set up a dozen other residents with Kindles and about another dozen so far with iPads + internet access.  This number will continue to grow.",1354584374

What a gravity boost from a planet does is transfer a very small amount of the planet's orbital kinetic energy to the spacecraft; it puts the planet into a slightly smaller orbit, and boosts the spacecraft to a higher speed on its way out. Since the Sun is what the planets are orbiting, this trick obviously won't work the same way with the Sun.<p>(Technically, the Sun itself, or more precisely the center of mass of the Solar System, is orbiting the center of the galaxy; so I suppose it would be theoretically possible to fly a spacecraft by the Sun in such a way as to transfer a very small amount of its orbital kinetic energy with respect to the center of the galaxy to the spacecraft, so it would fly outward faster than it went in, even after taking into account the slowdown climbing out of the Sun's gravity well.

Because of compatibility issues, you pay now and set yourself up to also pay more later. You agree to give a vendor near monopolistic powers over you in the future.

4868987,comment,4868699,4868699,5,0,gfodor,,,"It's a cool site, and an amazing accomplishment for a side project, but I really, really have to ask: why did you spend your time building something to add to the hyper-saturated, money black hole that is the music listening/discovery app market? I mean, there are, and have been <i>so many</i> sites like this that have either survived on the border of illegality or have been shut down. And we've got a whole host of above-board legal streaming sites now that are dirt cheap and have a wide variety of music to listen to. What's new here and why should I consider using it? Why will this be around in 6 months and not just die after you run out of money to keep it up or get sued? I'm not asking this to be a dick but I really don't understand why I see a new one of these sites get released every few months that seems to do the same thing as all the others except is free (and probably illegal) or thinks that slightly better music recommendations or ""social listening"" is a sustainable competitive advantage.<p>edit: Ok, read your blog post, but I guess my question still stands. The improvements you list are fairly marginal improvements over existing stuff IMHO and it seems mildly crazy to put in so much effort to replicate existing sites but add things like responsive design or slightly better Facebook integration. Good luck and I hope you end up turning this into an amazing success so if you can turn me into a believer I am listening :)",1354583671

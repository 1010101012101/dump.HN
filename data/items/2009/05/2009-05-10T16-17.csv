I may be wrong, but I think ""quick riches"" founders of startups look at the success of Google (a free business, with a targeted product from the start that later monetized) or Facebook (singular product starting with the Ivy League demographic, built around ads with an impressive $300-400 million revenue stage, minus hype) and think, ""I can do the same.""<p>I don't think so. Don't confuse the ecosystem these companies have built (contextual ads and social applications, respectively, worth hundreds of millions of dollars) with how they started. For some, free is an entry-point to using your product (perhaps content, bare features, etc) but for others, particularly e-commerce, free and ""platform plays"" are short sighted toward revenue and profit goals.<p>Smart founders and investors see ""free"" as an integrated component in their company's vision, when applicable.",1241974759

If something is tedious, I do my best to write a script to do it for me (sometimes even if the script takes longer to write than the tedious task).<p>That said, I really like looking to tests/specs for instructions on how to use a new API (especially if it's undocumented). Tests are definitely nice to have, even if they're a pain to write.<p>Also, I like Uncle Bob's idea of making the code cleaner with every commit (though I would of course separate any refactoring into its own commit).",1241974473

602252,comment,601951,602243,0,0,frig,,,"Right, but the point is that the ""right to a trial"" (at all):<p>- is a positive right (to have a jury trial at all implies judge, jury, etc., all of whom have better things to do with their time than listen to two losers argue back and forth, and thus somehow someone is going to be compelled to provide for the trial, either directly -- jury duty -- or indirectly -- via taxation)<p>- that a positive right makes it into the bill of rights means positive rights as such are not verboten, or somehow anathema to the founders' sensibilities<p>- or it's an entitlement (which is closer to the truth), but then again there's no problem with entitlements being enshrined in the bill of rights<p>I've got a special place in my heart for people who use the positive/negative distinction as a kind of club; cf my other post in this thread to see the origin of the notion in modern discourse.",1241974367

602243,comment,601951,602113,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Even though that is something guaranteed by something called the 'Bill of Rights' it's really more of an implementation detail of the general mission of the government. A speedy trial just ensures that the government must treat like things the same and different things differently. Without the 'speedy' provision then an innocent person could conceivably be treated as a guilty one by delaying trial. Similarly, the right to an <i>impartial jury</i> ('a jury of one's peers' isn't in the Constitution) is a check on arbitrariness on the part of the courts. So the first principle is that we're innocent until proven guilty and that like things should be treated alike and different things should be treated differently.",1241973779

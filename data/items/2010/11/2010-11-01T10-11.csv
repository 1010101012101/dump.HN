Actually, I doubt they will lock it down.<p>However: Apple's online stores, beginning with iTunes, and heading into the various app stores, have been a huge success, and, from a business standpoint, they would be foolish not to do something almost identical for the Mac. (I know they're going to do it; it's the ""almost identical"" part that I'm pointing out.)<p>And then, of course, from developers' point of view, Apple has created something wonderful. It is now possible to sell a file for $1/copy, never deal directly with end users, and make decent money at it. So given a Mac app store, developers signing on is obvious.<p>The result is that, even if the OS itself is not locked down (which, as I said, I consider unlikely), we end up with a situation in which getting quality software requires giving Apple control of your machine.<p>That is what I consider unacceptable. Quality software is why I bought a Mac. Linux's opennness, scriptability, etc., is great, but there is nothing on Linux with anywhere near the polish and usability of iMovie, GarageBand, etc. Nor will there be for some time, I think. And when that kind of thing moves over to the we-run-your-computer world, then I don't see any options left for a home computer I'd be willing to buy.",1288608633

I've done some great work remotely, and with the right tools I think a team can ""gel"" and really work well together. Any comments?""<p>In my experience, remote work is offered to <i>specific individuals</i> who are already known to the people making the offer - through a shared work history, impressive open source contributions, a recommendation by a trusted person, unique knowledge/skillsets etc. You don't generally see ads for these.<p>People who put out generic ads looking for fairly generic skill sets etc,  have plenty of choice locally and/or don't know anyone, remote or otherwise, who could fill that position. They are, in a sense just throwing an ad out there (or a post on HN), hoping to find someone who'll come into the office and work locally. Why go through the hassle of wading through the thousands of resumes you'll get from all over the world (and you will!), 99.99% of which are crap ?<p>I get approached for remote work all the time. Partly this is because I have a somewhat uncommon skill set and partly because I know/have worked with a lot of ultra sharp people and they remember me when they need someone. Most of the time I have to turn them down because I am already on a project and so not free - which is a common situation. As with ""normal"" jobs, the people you want often have great jobs/projects already and have no intention of ""moving"".<p>Fwiw, I know half a dozen or so people here in Bangalore who are working remotely for companies in the USA. In every case remote work was offered to them (no one ever sent in a CV)  because they were <i>known</i> to be very good at what they do <i>and</i> had no intention of moving to San Fransisco (or wherever).<p>Remote work <i>can</i> be a win-win but a distributed team has a very different feel than a collocated one and not many people want the hassle - and it <i>is</i> a hassle if you aren't willing to change your working style.<p>Things seem to be changing though. A really strong dev can get (great) remote work with some effort these days. The very  best, say Lars Bak, have never had any problems working from wherever they choose to. As with many things, demand and supply determines everything.<p>Fwiw, my advice to folks seeking remote work is Be very good, and be known to be very good (iow focus on what you know <i>and</i> who you know) and you will never lack for work, remote or otherwise.",1288608161

Personally I care about what works.  I care about what <i>should</i> work but I can't make it so and I refuse to imagine it to be so when it isn't.<p>>Because with open source software you get unhindered access to the source code and because sending bits over the internet is very cheap it is seen as pointless to charge for the media.<p>Seen by who?  Just off the hip, I suspect that most software that's on computing devices today is paid for.  I cite the massive profits MS makes on enterprise software and iPhone apps.  What are you citing to backup your nonintuitive claim?<p>>But open source software charge and make a very fine business from support.<p>?  This kind of thing is what really gives me the ""back to the past"" feeling about your posts.  Giving away software and charging for support is a <i>horrendous</i> business model (at least if that's all you have.  Places like IBM do make money doing this is an extra to their expensive software).  I can't think of <i>anyone</i> besides Redhat to have a a lot of success with it.  Everyone else has moved to advertising, freemium or some other technique to make it work.<p>Have you ever worked in support?  Personally I can't think of a worse job in computer science.  Listening to unreasonable assholes who feel they can demand anything because they're paying you.  If the free software movement wants to tell me that my only option as a software developer (they don't but just to address this idea of making money via support) is to give away my code and be paid to support it, they can go to hell.  I would learn another trade before I'd stoop to working in support again.  And I love developing.<p>>Your example of milk is odd because farming is subsidized, something that a lot of people find unfair but that is necessary so that you don't become agriculturally subservient to someone who suddenly becomes your enemy.<p>Uhm, what does farming subsidy have to do with anything?  Places like Walmart pay farmers <i>more</i> for the milk then what they charge themselves.  I.e. they seel it at a <i>loss</i>.  It isn't Walmart who gets these subsidies but the <i>farmers</i>.<p>>And what does milk lead to?<p>Are you serious?  You don't know anything about this stuff?  I chose the ""milk as a loss leader"" example because it should be familiar to most people.<p>Just to educate you on this; go into a Walmart.  Do you know where the milk is?  It's in the very back of the store.  So you have to walk by all their other high-margin offerings to get it.  Milk is something you have to get often so it makes a good lure to get people in the store so you can start advertising to them.<p>>Gaming consoles, yes. But apparently Nintendo never has.<p>I don't believe this is the case.  They may have never sold the <i>wii</i> at a loss but Nintendo is one of the original console players.  The wrote the blue print for this stuff, it's hard to believe that they <i>never</i> sold consoles at a loss.<p>>This does not mean that your television programs are loss leaders because what do they lead to?<p>They are loss leaders.  The product is the viewers, the customers are the advertisers.  The programs are the product they produce and then give away to get their high margin product (viewers) in the door.<p>>The example that is kind of true reinforces my point about software being exorbitantly priced.<p>Software is more difficult to price because it costs so much up front but costs nothing more to produce once made.  I think the market is doing ok at finding the price for it though.<p>Why do you say ""exorbitantly priced""?  Have you ever produced anything substantial and found it was really cheap to do?  Do you simply think everything should cost less than it does or are you picking on software only (e.g. if you think a BMW should cost so much but software shouldn't then why?)?<p>>It's not about size. It is about your return on your stock investment in terms of the share price going up and not down, and the dividends on the shares.<p>You're trying to change the game here.  The reason people use market cap as the metric is because it's the best indicator we have.  You've found some metric that shows what you want the result to be and chosen that.  Do a little more research and I bet you could find a penny stock that beats MS <i>and</i> Redhat.<p>>Judging things by just how ""big"" they are is not a great way to go about educating yourself.<p>It is if you want to know who is more successful.  Are you seriously trying to claim that Redhat is out-performing Microsoft?  Seriously?  That is just utter delusion talking.  You were trying to call <i>me</i> out on ideology?  I'd like to see MS go down as much as the next MS hater, but I won't lie to myself.<p>>You are joking aren't?<p>Are you?  Who cares about Redhat?<p>>Redhat competes with Windows in the enterprise.<p>Along with <i>a lot</i> of other players.  Of all the ones to worry about, Redhat would be the last on my list (if it made the list at all).  They're just a support organization, big deal.  I'd be <i>much</i> more worried about e.g. Oracle coming in and locking out my platform.<p>>They are a direct competitor of Microsoft's cash cow.<p>They have no offering that competes with MS.  Be honest with yourself.  Redhat Linux usually replaces the other Unix vendors that were there, not even Windows servers.  And the desktop?  Not in our lifetimes.  OpenOffice can't take MS office on head to head and almost certainly never will.  I'm sure Office will go down one day (maybe even in less than 10 years) but not to Redhat, come on.<p>>Apple is too but only kind of because Macos is not a general purpose OS and always comes wrapped in shiny hardware and so doesn't compete directly with Microsoft.<p>Do you have <i>any</i> idea what's going on in the wild?  The landscape has changed over the last 2 years, you seem to have missed it.  OSX is very much a general purpose OS.  I've replaced all my windows machines with OSX ones in a way I would never have been able to with Linux.  OSX is continuing to gain market on the desk and they're crushing on appliances.  They're already in any enterprise that does graphics and they're making headway on regular corporate.  I don't see them really trying too hard with corporate right now but they have a presence and a leverage point to exploit if they wanted in (IOS).  Redhat has nothing to leverage because they have nothing compelling.  They're just offering support on a cheap Unix variant, so companies replace their existing Unix vendor with Redhat and forget about them.<p>>It's more the other way, as Microsoft expands beyond its cash cows it enters the turf of others, into music devices or web search for instance.<p>That's worked great for them so far...<p>>And Apple kind of proves my point cuz Darwin and LLVM are open source projects that Apple heavily invests in so gives them a competitive advantage.<p>Darwin just helps them compete against apt/RPM/etc. so people want a Unix desktop can chose them over Linux.  Another loss leader.  LLVM is a better example though, but it's mainly competing against GCC.<p>>""As the first major computer company to make Open Source development a key part of its ongoing software strategy, Apple remains committed to the Open Source development model. Major components of Mac OS X, including the UNIX core, are made available under Appleâ€™s Open Source license""<p>Sure, they play nice with open source developers for the same reason phone App developers develop for iPhone <i>and</i> Android.  Android sells maybe 50% what you can do on iPhone but that's still 50% on the table, no reason to ignore it if you can afford to produce for two platforms.<p>>And what about this community?

When you combine the branching logic from several components the combinatorial range of behaviour can be vast. By isolating units at the points of inflexion you are able to test a far smaller range of inputs/outputs so that you can achieve effective test coverage. You're quite correct that the units you tests are not necessarily aligned 1 to 1 with your classes.

1855936,comment,1854209,1854926,0,0,trotsky,,,"That something like this is a security threat is without question - in addition to the defcon presentations, a variety designed to attack has been featured on the popular usb interface site users projects list for some time. Odds are the technique has already owned at least a few folks.<p>I'm sure the creator of the card is a fine guy, and the short time it'd be inserted along with him standing right there and your active attention means it's practically pretty safe.<p>The party line in security is that once an attacker has physical access to the computer compromise is so trivial mitigating any specific attack is a waste of time. That's certainly true right now: firewire, PCI-E and hard drive removal are much more dangerous. But it's more of a philosophy than a logical truth - security is really just the practice of raising the bar enough to counter the level of threat. The fact that critical computers aren't connected to the internet or any network at all doesn't stop OS vendors from spending countless hours fixing exploits.<p>Someday a bus design like this will seem hopelessly niave and be long gone just like telnet and analog cell phones. Virtually all attacks right now involve holes with well defined solutions - think 802.1x, DNSSEC, http and smart cards. But adoption is usually glacial and universal adoption would only lead to new holes being exploited.<p>The potential for USB attacks goes far beyond a simple HID controller. Any serious attacker would disguise or hide a device in a way that would make it easy to include a few more chips and a much more sophisticated design. Include a benign real device that matches whatever function the user expects - flash drive, mouse, etc. Wait some time before attaching the keyboard service suspicion - at the same time connect a serial class as well allowing a reliable command channel after just ""typing"" a two or three line script. Send over a better native command program, maybe wait until the user idles, mount storage or replace existing flash blocks with privesc exploits, rootkits, etc. A modern, well administered system may be difficult to exploit directly as a user. Crash or reboot the OS, possibly including a crash dump or hybrid sleep first for later access to kernel data. Once the usb bus resets, provide a variety of usb storage types for the BIOS to find - one will usually preempt the main hdd with a linux image that would show an OS appropriate boot animation perhaps with a filesystem check to explain any delay. At this point it could grab the BIOS image and repack it with a ROM root kit and reflash it or replace ethernet, video or dvd firmware to provide pre-boot or even pre-BIOS control. Attack the boot loader, kernel files or anything else needed to remove code signing requirements or install new certificates, integrity checks, install a good rootkit, etc. Disable the usb storage, pass control to the real boot loader and once full control is confirmed wipe the bad bits of NAND and microcontroller flash, blow an efuse to disable any naughty hardware and you're done.<p>While that is all highly speculative and sounds complex, it's 100% possible and would be a small amount of work compared to what goes into modern root kits and bot code.<p>Such an attack is probably not something a common user would ever face though high value targets are often subjected to at least as much effort. All bets are off if someone designed an easy to use version, produced a significant run of them and packaged them nicely. Rootkits have gone from rare and amateur to polished and plug and play and widely used rather quickly.<p>This spring I was shown a keyboard that included a hardware keylogger with flash, usb serial interface, a tiny microphone and a cmos clock. The chips were on a board identical in size and location of the one normally installed. It was flipped upside down, screw heads stripped clean and glued in, with a number of large industrial staples attaching it to the plastic below. When disassembled the components were found to be covered with thick epoxy. At some point during the initial investigation a trace to a small battery was broken and a SIM was destroyed. The bootstrap passed some code through the smart card and a majority of the controller and secondary flash were encrypted.<p>As interesting as the design was, even many dead simple gadgets require more technical expertise to create. I was told that the design was very similar to a popular commercially available keylogger minus the smart card and mic. You can find them for $100 or less many spots on the web.<p>The most striking fact is that the victim purchased the keyboard themselves from a well known US web store as an OEM keyboard. It was delivered to his door by UPS, it was the style ordered, shrink wrapped, and included another item that was legit. Suspicion arose because the keyboard quality was low and appeared counterfeit. When connected, it displayed a device name that included some unicode and some garbage at the end that included some simple shell code.<p>The user didn't know why he'd been targeted and lacked any typical high risk factors or usual motivations for attack. The source was never identified, no similar kit was found in the retailer's stock. The item had sat in the users wish list at the retailer for several months before being ordered. The victim reported a sophisticated attack occurring nine months prior, no evidence was found of an existing intrusion. Law enforcement suspected it had been included accidentally before leaving china and likely is produced on the same line as benign versions.",1288606577

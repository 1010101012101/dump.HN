The government knows this and is working hard to make sure that any harm done by mass surveillance is hidden using parallel construction.<p>What is an interesting and useful game is to imagine a scenario which would trigger massive public outrage over the use of mass surveillance. What would really drive the point home that this is a truly dangerous amount of power? To be honest, I don&#x27;t think a single major mistake with a citizen would do it (e.g. killing someone based on mass surveillance). Too many apologists would make the case that this is cherry picking and that it&#x27;s just an exceptional case. A pattern of mistakes would perhaps be better (putting thousands of people on the no fly list for no reason), but these kinds of stories tend to be too cerebral for the general public to focus on (although people like Colbert and John Oliver are really good at solving that problem!)<p>I think the only thing that might do it would be a Watergate style scandal where one group of powerful people use the machinery to mess with another group of powerful people. Consider how much more seriously Feinstein took the CIA when it became clear they were spying on <i>her</i> and <i>her staff</i> during the torture investigations. Or Angela Merkel&#x27;s reaction to <i>her</i> cell phone being tapped.

I personally did 2.5 years as a professional mechanical engineer right after college, then switched over to software and have been doing that ever since.<p>Some possible pathways - look for a job that is at the intersection of mechanical engineering & computer science. There are companies that write simulation programs, it&#x27;s harder to find people that understand the engineering math than it is to find people that can write code.

9276592,comment,9268349,9274653,0,0,samch,,,"I hear what you&#x27;re saying, but I&#x27;m not seeing a proposed alternative.  Say the government allocated $500k to early-stage research for a particular drug.  Would we then want the taxpayers to fund a startup company to see if that drug can be scaled and work its way to early stage trials?  Should the government then, seeing that progress, step in again and fund the full set of trials and a manufacturing facility and a marketing campaign to get this drug to the taxpayers who need it?<p>Maybe you&#x27;re suggesting that the first step would be to repay the government some or all of the grant money.  Well, maybe it&#x27;s a bit surprising, but there&#x27;s not a way to do that in the US.  I suppose that the pharma companies should be sending a lot of corporate tax revenue back to the government, but I&#x27;d imagine there could be loopholes there.  Not every country is like this.  Some countries like Singapore actually demand a cut of action in return for the grant money [1].<p>Maybe we&#x27;d just do away with the concept of patents.  Then, the government could fund the early stage research and the fruit of that would be open to all.  Now, who would step up the plate and do all the heavy lifting to get the drug to market?  Once it&#x27;s been approved by the FDA, any pharma company domestic or foreign could simply make a generic version without having to incur all of the enormous costs associated with getting it approved in the first place.  So, my guess is that we wouldn&#x27;t see many new drug developments coming out and new form of IP protection would have to be put in place to encourage new developments.<p>Since so much of the world simply tags along with our FDA protections, maybe we convince them to chip in on the costs.  We&#x27;d basically tell to the other industrialized nations that unless they help carry the cost of drug research and development, no new medicines for them.  I doubt that would fly.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m out of ideas here.  Any other suggestions?<p>1. <a href=""http://www.a-star.edu.sg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a-star.edu.sg/</a>",1427467800

However, if you&#x27;re working on an unnamed file, then the editor (or its designers) has to make a choice about what to do with that unnamed document when you&#x27;re done.<p>Git treats an unnamed branch like the <i>scratch</i> buffer in Emacs. You can make all the changes you want, but once you close it, it&#x27;s gone (in this case, eligible for GC). This seems reasonable, because if you cared about it, you would have given it a name.<p>Mercurial&#x27;s designers work off a different assumption: all the work that you do is important (and it provides other mechanisms to allow rough work). So if you start working in an unnamed branch, that&#x27;s no problem. You can have as many unnamed branches as you like, but it&#x27;s up to you to remember your way around.

Problem with that, of course, is I think something needs to have complete knowledge of the data structure to make it work, plus now you have yet another thing to update over network.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that ZeroDB will necessarily have all the answers here prepackaged. I&#x27;m still waiting to see exactly how intelligent their client modules are. I doubt they&#x27;re just delivering a bucket store, so I assume they&#x27;ll have client-side code that&#x27;ll encapsulate the BST handling. The question is whether it&#x27;s naive or accounts for some of this. If nothing else, I assume michwill is probably taking notes!<p>At any rate, my hope is this ends up being an interesting enough solution to build some degree of pattern or best practice over to handle some of these aspects. These might be as simple (and limiting) as &quot;one table, one source of truth, period,&quot; or &quot;Use for write-seldom; read-often applications only,&quot; or some other thing like that.<p>Even if so, this could be quite useful for -some- subset of applications, or at the very least a useful step on the way to figuring out how to do this sort of thing.<p>Certainly there are other challenges here as well. Beyond integrity issues, there&#x27;s still the information leakage issues. It&#x27;s already been mentioned that a binary search leaks order information to begin with, but if you know what kind of tree is being used you leak a lot of order information as the rotates happen.<p>But again, maybe surmountable.

As long as you&#x27;re relatively active (~3hrs of exercise/wk) you&#x27;re probably OK just standing an hour or two a day.<p>I opted for an adjustable standing desk that I love.  After doing a lot of research I ended up going with a brand called EvoDesk (<a href=""http://www.evodesk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evodesk.com</a>).  Their parent company is NextDesk, which has nice products, but cost more than I was willing to spend for what I wanted.<p>I ended up getting the smallest desk they have (48&quot;).   With all of the options, including the speakers it came out to around $1,000, which I consider reasonable for a tool I use ~14hrs a day, ~everyday.  Though, I ordered the keyboard platform add-on, but didn&#x27;t like it (I&#x27;m fairly tall) so it&#x27;s sitting in the closet.<p>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks now and love it.  I stand anywhere from 1hr - 6hrs/day depending on what&#x27;s going on.  This isn&#x27;t the best image of the desk, but I took this picture the other week for a &quot;show us your office&quot; thread: <a href=""http://imgur.com/ybIEoqB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/ybIEoqB</a>  The desk is at sitting height.  The bubble looking thing under the desk is the subwoofer for the Harman Kardon sound system option that came with it.  You could probably order it for $30 or so cheaper separately on Amazon, but I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with drilling/finding my own screws.  It has 4 height memory presets.  I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&quot; and the highest desk height is about 6&quot; higher than what I use standing.<p>Now that I have a standing desk I can&#x27;t imagine going back, but I&#x27;d definitely want an adjustable desk.  If I had to choose between a fixed sitting desk or a fixed standing desk I&#x27;d choose a fixed sitting desk.",1427466583

In Argentina, we have a few recipes to add some oil to the rice, normally sunflower or maize oil, sometime butter, or directly fry the rice slightly before cooking it. So it&#x27;s not an unusual idea, so it&#x27;s very strange that it&#x27;s wasteful.<p>If you want rice with fewer calories, mix it with other vegetables. Not bean, because beans are a cheap source of calories and proteins, so they are a good mix for a traditional recipe.

Young people are often exposed to worldly, societal, behavioral, moral, or philosophical matters through authors who yank around the story in any way they please, such as with &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, or &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.<p>In my opinion, these young people are being intellectually disrespected without knowing it. Always exposed to a kitsch view through a <i>highly</i> obscured lens with a penchant for melodrama. It&#x27;s a world of non-seriousness where everything is just opinion, and what&#x27;s important is to express how you think anything works. Some people grow into adult versions of this.<p>But when you read what adults think about the phenomena of bullying and predictors of victimhood, it&#x27;s a little bit different. Or when you read about childhood predictors to different adult styles of drug use, you start viewing things a little different. Or when you read of how a team of adults performed brain surgery on a songbird to investigate human behavior, you start viewing things a little different. You also start seeing the severity of prediction.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a bit cold in doing nothing to shield the reader from the perspective of the writer, but almost never tactless. And it&#x27;s very respectful to the reader. It might be the first time a young person isn&#x27;t spoon-fed a highly obscured and Hollywood-ish discussion about the world.",1427466039

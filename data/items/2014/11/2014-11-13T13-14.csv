It is much more readable than scheme if you ask me but not necessarily more powerful. You get the benefits of the very powerful and ubiquitous javascript compilers that exist nowadays which I like.<p>I played with it and you are somewhat limited right now. The first issues is that you quickly hit the top of the javascript stack because of the recursive style (remember: no loops). The most elegant solution to that would be for browsers to support tail call optimisations which is in the ES6 standard (Are you listening Mozilla or Google? If you implement this part of the spec sooner you could be leading the way for the most promising area of AI and maybe of computing in general). Although there are possible work around namely if the webppl compiler were to use trampolines or &quot;promise&quot; like structures. IMO, it would clutter the code and be much less elegant than native ES6 TCO.<p>The second limitation is that you are not allowed mutability. There is a git branch with support for mutability partly implemented. I&#x27;m not sure they should go that way though. I&#x27;ve never really been into functional programming style but in the case of probabilistic languages, I really see the value. It&#x27;s much simpler and easier to follow what is going on when debugging. Supporting mutability also makes the compiler more complex and memory usage high as you have to copy the whole memory footprint of your program at each probabilistic sample you take. It is not that difficult to instead include something like mori <a href=""http://swannodette.github.io/mori/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swannodette.github.io/mori/</a>

White Dutch bread has a cake-y character to it, which goes very well together with more &#x27;delicate&#x27; toppings like butter & hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles), jam, a young dutch cheese or boiled ham, which are common in the Netherlands. Whole wheat sourdough bread, no matter how great, just doesn&#x27;t mesh with delicate toppings like strawberry jam. That said, a baguette or artisan bread is a far superior base for a good old cheese, Serrano ham or other &#x27;strong&#x27; toppings. This is why brown dutch bread is never worth buying IMO -- it&#x27;s kind of a weird thing like cake made with whole wheat flour that reminds me of antroposophic foods: it&#x27;s slightly less unhealthy but it tastes like crap.

With this kind of thing there&#x27;s a big incentive not to report bugs to the project but to sell them to a company who has no incentive to see them fixed...<p>Then a lot of people need to revisit their own thoughts on  exactly why they use open source, and the consequences of what happens if it goes away.<p>> For example, will we see these companies hiring ex-developers and testers from software product companies, as they might have inside knowledge of where products are weak.<p>That might happen, but it depends on intent. Products may be realized to be weak afterwards, due to a changing software landscape, so the company hiring them is a good thing - the software gets fixed in some way, and a need was fulfilled.<p>Then the question becomes: how likely do you think it is that someone purposefully creates a flawed product in order to make a gain later, after the project has been completed, released; after they have left the job; after they have been hired by these testing companies? It sounds as likely to me as people purposefully putting back-doors into software for future self interest. There exists another outlet for unethical intent, but in my opinion, the problem begins with ethics to begin with.<p>Software is too complex to perfect. There will always be bugs. Regulation of industry and regulation of the regulatory bodies is additionally, very complex. The idea of regulating where knowledge is allowed to flow on top of that horrifies me: i.e., whether a developer is allowed to work at one of these companies eventually, in judgment of prior work.<p>I wish people had greater incentive to maintain a standardization of ethics, but this is all theoretical to begin with, at least from my direct observations.

8601384,comment,8599589,8600942,0,0,yaantc,,,"Dual SIM is working fine with 2G, but not well with always on data. What&#x27;s important to understand is that those dual SIM devices only have a single radio, that must be shared between both SIMs. And that&#x27;s not part of the standard, so one has to play some tricks.<p>In the 2G era, the modem was mostly in idle mode. In this mode it sleep most of the time, and wakes up now and then (network configurable, around 1 sec. roughly) to listen for a paging opportunity. The network uses this time slot to send a paging signal to the device if it needs to wake up and reconnect because of a network initiated incoming call.
Because the active paging time is very small compared to the sleep duration of the paging cycle, it&#x27;s pretty easy to handle two SIMs: register serially, and then the paging opportunity are unlikely to clash (and if they do one can play tricks until they don&#x27;t).
Then if a call comes in on one SIM, connect for this SIM. You can&#x27;t listen to the other SIM paging but it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll get two calls at the same time, and without answer another call will go to your voice mail, which is good. 
That was dual active dual SIM at the time of 2G, and it was good for the users.<p>With 3G without data, it&#x27;s about the same. But with modern 3G with mostly always on, and for sure with LTE with always on data, it&#x27;s much more tricky. The modem will still go to idle a good part of the time even with always on data, but it&#x27;ll wake-up much more often and at unpredictable times. Also, there are other low-power modes that can remove the need to go to idle for arbitrarily long durations (like connected DRX in LTE for example). It&#x27;s just not safe to mux two active SIMs in this environment.<p>So in short: forget about dual active SIMs with 4G. You can still have dual SIM slots, with a user controlled switch and only one active at a time. But it&#x27;s not as convenient.",1415885638

If you take a look at the C2 wiki or MeatballWiki, rejecting information make less of a problem even though they share the principle of anyone being able to edit anything on any page.
MeatballWiki states that it is not an encyclopedia, but rather a set of pages which feature discussion. Because of this, there is less grounds to refuse or revert edits with the reason of being &quot;off-topic&quot; (because discussion usually means merging several related topics) or for being &quot;biased&quot; (again, a feature of discussion is to get one&#x27;s personal viewpoint across).<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think this is a problem due to wiki software or the open nature of wikis, but rather wikis-as-encyclopediae or even Wikipedia specifically. &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; places a huge set of rules as to what can be added and what not.",1415884734

8601269,comment,8600830,8600830,0,0,gokhan,,,"From Reddit[1]:<p><i>&quot;Got fresh news from the team, they are broadcasting live right now on french TV ! Philae landed, and bounced slowly for (1-2-? hours), and travelled 1km away the targetted site. Yes 1000m. Then know this because of the datas from the radar. It&#x27;s now stopped slanted, some cams are shooting the sky, other the ground, and other nearby rocks, as seen on the first photo. It&#x27;s inside some kind of cave/hole, not much sun for the solar panels.<p>EDIT1: It landed on the core of the comet, it sees the light from the sun for about 1 to 2 hours per day. In the next days/week the angle of the comet will change/sun, and it very likely the solar panel will get more sunlight so more power for the probe.<p>EDIT2 : Many labs are performing right now and performed the whole night. For now they put the drilling on hold since they don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s tied to the ground or not. Drilling op was also power hungry so it&#x27;s kinda a good thing it&#x27;s on hold since there&#x27;s not much sun available for the panels. Battery life been re-estimated to 50-55hours due to the lack of sunlight. This time includes the 7 hours of descent.They are constantly adjusting missions goals, depending on conditions, power available, etc,<p>EDIT3 : The probe has been working to gather scientifict datas the whole time, including during the bounces. There&#x27;s already a large amount of datas available, whatever happens next.<p>EDIT4 : It&#x27;s resting on &quot;hard&quot; ground, with a layer of dust about 30cm, and that&#x27;s good news because it allows measurements to proceed as planned. As in, it&#x27;s not burried into soft soil.<p>EDIT5 : Solar panels are deployed, radio link is up and running, but the fact the probe is slanted/in a hole/random ground limits the time it can communicate with the orbiter, but that&#x27;s not jeopardizing the mission. There&#x27;s already a lot of datas transmitted successfully to the orbiter. Contact between the orbiter and the probe can be approximately done twice per day.<p>EDIT6 : The first place it touched the comet was exaclty where it was planned, flat and cosy, too bad it didn&#x27;t harpoon there.<p>EDIT7 : Next contact will be near 19:30GMT, until 23:45GMT approx. This night they made contact with the probe (from the orbiter) at about 4:00GMT, and at 5:30GMT they had safely recovered all the datas from the first batch of tests.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2m63hd/first_civa_image_confirming_that_philae_is_on/cm19x10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2m63hd/first_civa_ima...</a>",1415883633

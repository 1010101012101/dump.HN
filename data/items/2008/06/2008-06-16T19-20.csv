In fact it was mentioned to me that my cover letter was part of the reason I was brought in for an interview.  Cover letter's don't have to contain all of the regurgitated crap you find on resume help sites. Its a great way to get a lot of the finer points across that your resume simply can't.  Be sure that every cover letter (like your resume) is tailored to the particular job and company you are applying to.  Nothing looks worse than a cookie cutter cover letter where someone can easily tell you just swapped out the hiring manager's and company's name.<p>On top of that... I wore a suit to the interview.

Salaries in finance are low-average by NYC/Chicago standards, while bonuses are high-- starting at 25-75% for junior positions, and rising to 1000+% at a senior level.<p>Good bonuses have a positive effect on morale, but the real kick finance gets out of the system is in recruiting. The possibility to take home a $1 million bonus check as a fifth-year employee, brings in a lot of bright, young people who don't know what else to do with their lives but are willing to work very hard. Finance's rather unique compensation system certainly stokes people to put out a lot of effort.<p>The downside is that, since everyone is after the same things, politics come more into play-- if someone feels shortchanged in project selection, like he's not being groomed to be a future rock star, he's going to do shitty work. In tech, people are after interesting work, and everyone has a different opinion about what's interesting, so the game is not zero-sum; in finance, they're mostly looking to advance their careers and make money... which approaches zero-sum as the size of the company increases.",1213644050

It's a social hack to get access to both places and people. Personally I prefer not to work in one, but for important meetings or for working directly with (formal, older) customers then it's worth putting on the monkey suit.",1213643343

I think I would rather it be an RSS reader, or something similar to that... It's obviously good at filtering, and I think that applies really well to doing things with RSS.<p>EDIT (adding more): What about a big giant pool of people's RSS feeds to get content? You could then filter on users (by filtering on which feeds they subscribe too). You like @rms and @pg for instance, but aren't so interested in @apgwoz's feeds... Though, I'm not sure, that seems like it'd be of limited value.",1213642985

However, P2P is only becoming more and more mainstream. (One could argue that it already is mainstream when it comes to MP3 audio.) And with dedicated media devices becoming more prevalent, downloading video around-the-clock isn't going to be so rare.<p>So my point still stands that users are only becoming greater consumers of bandwidth over time, and it's simply not sufficient for the major internet providers to pretend that all anyone will ever want to do with their net connections is check email.",1213642938

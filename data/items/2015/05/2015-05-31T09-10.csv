Making a substance illegal drives up the price. If you made milk illegal tomorrow morning there would be illegal milk available at a substantial mark-up the day after and an underground distribution network would spring up overnight. It&#x27;s simply economics.<p>Laundered criminal money is <i>still</i> a problem.<p>The &#x27;drug problem&#x27; would definitely be less if all drugs were legal because it would allow those that are in need of help to apply for that help on a medical basis rather than to have to deal with these issues either on their own or through the justice system if and when they get caught.<p>The &#x27;law is always right&#x27; is a funny one, no, the law isn&#x27;t always right, it simply defines what is legal and what is not, emphatically <i>NOT</i> what is and isn&#x27;t right, for that we have morals and ethics, not laws.<p>For example: slavery was never right, even though it was legal at some point.",1433066347

Dynamic variables usually require inserting checks at runtime that can&#x27;t be optimized away by an AOT compiler. This is where a speculatively-optimizing JIT comes in handy, but JITs aren&#x27;t appropriate for all uses, and even where they are, good optimizing JITs are notoriously hard to write.<p>But special case JITs that essentially build a version of a function out of predefined blocks, are not that hard to implement. That&#x27;s enough to remove current (constant) state dependant branches and do constant folding.<p>Useful for parsing, some generic data structures and graphics. Anything that is executed <i>very</i> many times, has configurable (but constant) state that controls conditional branching or a part of computation that could be constant folded.",1433066053

You only need to look at how the EU elections are managed versus how the elections for the US Presidency and congress are seen by the US citizens.<p>The sovereign &#x27;countries&#x27; are imaginary constructs made real by physical, cultural and psychological factors, &#x27;power&#x27; is such a psychological factor and I think it is far less of an item absent &#x27;nationalism&#x27; and we&#x27;re seeing a very strong resurgence of this in Europe right now. There isn&#x27;t a country that does not have a far-right or far-left ultra nationalist political party that manages to get a substantial part of the vote. If anything happened at all during the last decade then it is that Europe&#x27;s window for unity is slowly closing and that in some parts we&#x27;re already regressing.<p>This gets expressed in an &#x27;us versus them&#x27; mentality not seen since the 80&#x27;s, the latest nice example of that is Germany deciding to start levying toll on foreigners for the use of the German roads. (Which given the location of Germany is for many people the equivalent of an in-escapable tax.)<p>So if you feel the Union is converging then that&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m seeing the opposite, more and more nationalist sentiments, Greece possibly departing the Euro and maybe even departing the EU, the UK and possibly others no longer being a part of the union and more and more limitations placed on the original &#x27;free travel of goods and people&#x27; mandate that enabled a lot of the EU to get closer.<p>So, no, it&#x27;s not there yet and the way things are going we&#x27;re not ever going to get there either.<p>The EU did a number of things very wrong, they tried to force the issue on a number of occasions and in fact succeeded in several of those but while they won those particular battles they lost the war in that the &#x27;locals&#x27; are not Europe minded because they see downsides to it as well. And that&#x27;s fine, but ramming unification down their throats definitely is one of the reasons all these backlashes found ground to sprout in and take hold.<p>Wilders, Le-Pen, the UK euro-skeptics, Greek nationalists and so on all have one thing in common: they use the anti-EU sentiment as their main driving force (and in the case of Wilders, also anti-Islam, but then again, he&#x27;s simply a nutcase that has found some fear buttons that he can push, like all the other demagogues in history, which doesn&#x27;t make him any less dangerous).",1433066021

It&#x27;s a circular reasoning if then the organizdd crime is said to be bad because it supplies drugs, that are dangerous and should be controled. I mean, if crime was only about drugs, the user would support the drug supply, i.e. the support. To support the support doesn&#x27;t sound very unethical. The matter that is supported is the problem.<p>Sure, there is worse crime that may use drugmoney, but it might and does use legally optained funds after laundry as well. You might argue that the drug problem itself wouldn&#x27;t flourish any less, if it was legal.

9633620,comment,9633352,9633352,0,0,pron,,,"There are a few reasons why this is hard:<p>* Lack of information -- in order to pick the right parameters, the system needs to know what you&#x27;re trying to achieve (e.g., do you want to minimize latency or maximize throughput?). Communicating that more effectively than just specifying parameters is challenging.<p>* Instead of telling the system what you want, it can try to figure it out -- to <i>some</i> extent -- by observing program behavior and dynamically fiddling with value. The problem with this approach is that it creates feedback loops that muddle things beyond repair.<p>* Optimization over a high dimensional space is hard. As an example (even with just one dimension), see this bit from Doug Lea&#x27;s talk about why dynamic tuning of spinning vs. blocking on concurrency constructs doesn&#x27;t work: <a href=""https://youtu.be/sq0MX3fHkro?t=39m48s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/sq0MX3fHkro?t=39m48s</a><p>* Writing systems that never reboot[1] <i>and</i> are efficient is very hard. Dynamic variables usually require inserting checks at runtime that can&#x27;t be optimized away by an AOT compiler. This is where a speculatively-optimizing JIT comes in handy, but JITs aren&#x27;t appropriate for all uses, and even where they are, good optimizing JITs are notoriously hard to write.<p>--<p>> Why does the JVM still need messing around GC settings to get acceptable performance/memory usage?<p>OpenJDK&#x27;s HotSpot does fairly reasonable auto-tuning now (known as &quot;GC ergonomics&quot;). You  can pick either the throughput collector and <i>maybe</i> set your young-gen ratio, or G1 and set a maximum-pause goal. Along with the maximum heap size, those are just three values, one of which is binary, another is often unnecessary and the third can be a very rough estimation. This should be more than enough for the vast majority of systems, certainly with Java 8. Much of the GC tuning parameters you see in the wild are old remnants from before GC ergonomics, that people are afraid to pull out.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.il/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.il/2007/01/pinocchio-problem....</a>",1433064434

This way you don&#x27;t need to use trim that much and the SSD will anyway write it into a different place.<p>It should be noted that while an SSD can&#x27;t write before erasing it will actually not even attempt that. The SSD maintains a mapping from LBA to physical flash chip and offset and will write to a completely different place. It will then mark the old location as unused and erase it when it can spare some time and power.",1433063081

A definition of a topology of a space is given by, starting from an underlying set,  the definition of the open intervals (there are also other ways, this is the most used one) which gives the notion of continuous functions.
Another approach to define a topology is by defining a distance which gives a metric space and the definition of open intervals.
Any variant of the GoL I have seen is discrete, every cell has distance one from its adjacent cell. It is the adjacence notion that defines the nearness, hence the space.
That is the math that I applyed, to deduce that when you define a function <i>getNeighboursOf</i>, you are actually defining the shape of the space, and also its set (the counter image of the function).",1433063042

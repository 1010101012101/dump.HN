10033048,comment,10030826,10032857,0,0,tajen,,,"Price. Your question is a little strange on HN, so either you&#x27;re a little anticapitalist, either I didn&#x27;t wrtie well, either I&#x27;m not understanding your question. So here&#x27;s more explanation, hopefully answering your question at the right level:<p>- Raising prices is an automatic way to choose customers to match demand. Some part of the customers won&#x27;t be able to afford water, so they will have to use alternatives: No fancy garden, no watermelon agriculture, no golf course? Good part is, I&#x27;m not the one who chooses, the market will decide depending on who really wants to use water. The other customers will have to spend more money on water, and this is good because it compensates the water producer for the loss of the other customers, and give them more money to, maybe, build a desalinization plant.<p>- &quot;But this is evil!&quot; Yes some people can&#x27;t afford life in some areas. Maybe the root of the problem is actually an unsustainable density of population in the Bay area. High prices are already driving people out of California on a large scale, and we need to drive even more people out. It&#x27;s what needs to be done, because we mustn&#x27;t overexploit natural resources in an area.<p>- &quot;But this is what Wall Street does, and Wall Street is bad!&quot; Wall Street isn&#x27;t the entierty of economy. Look at all local exchanges: On a local market, price determines the first customers who will be able to afford the $3/kg tomatoes. If there&#x27;s not enough tomatoes for the last customer who could afford them, then the farmer could have raised the price; if there are remaining tomatoes, the farmer set the price too high. Money decides where people reside in a city. Money decides that you can either choose to have a lamborghini or eat meat during the rest of your life. Good point is, the government doesn&#x27;t have to decide who the meat goes to using criteria, the market does automatically, and does it well for 99,99% of worldwide exchanges. The rest is hedge funds, yes they may badly assign funds sometimes, yes they have impacts on global crisis, but those alter the number of worldwide exchanges by only a dozen in a billion.<p>- But &quot;companies are richer than customers!&quot;. Yes and no. They just pay water &quot;before tax&quot;. First, don&#x27;t forget that the consumer pays in the end. Second, in France we have a 68% tax burden, so when a companies would pay 100€ for goods, they&#x27;d have to pay a salary of 230€ to an employee if he wants to buy the same 100€ goods. So yes, companies are richer, but it&#x27;s only our fault: The less taxes we have on wages, less there&#x27;s a difference between corporate and consumer wallets. We&#x27;re just imposing this to ourselves. Many economists wonder why we tax wages, because taxing a sector discourages the use of it; Thus we&#x27;d be better off with 0% wage tax to encourage employment and equivalent (high) tax on polluting products to discourage their use. But that is a story for another day.<p>Hopefully I haven&#x27;t hurt feelings of anyone by showing too much distance with the people who are defavouritized in this system.",1439189388

Getting at the basic meaning of things is what he lived for.<p>People tend to take this all sorts of ways.  I find watching and reading about Feynman so notable, because all the bravado and aggression is just fun down deep. He&#x27;s playful and in the play comes really great insights.<p>He related some of this in one of his stories about the Manhattan Project.  He was young, and not yet of superior standing among his physics peers.  A famous and very highly regarded physicist engaged Feynman on something one day, and Feynman told him he thought the whole thing nuts!  No fear, just raw sharing of mind to mind.<p>That guy would come back and request more dialog time with Feynman because Feynman didn&#x27;t fear him and just shared his thoughts and feelings about whatever it was unabashedly.<p>That is what people are seeing in the interview, and it&#x27;s rare.  Very, very rare.<p>The interviewer should be quite pleased to see Feynman sharing as he would with any peer and not coddling, or glossing over things for what Feynman would consider shallow and unproductive reasons.<p>Strange as it may appear now, Feynman was showing respect and giving the interview an honest go, not making a show for people who would watch such things as happy curios.  Instead, it&#x27;s a record for those who want to know something about Feynman.<p>And say what you want, Feynman tried hard to demonstrate good intent in his life.  Remember that on passages like this.<p><i></i>And the good intent here is to spark the interest of the person asking why.  Rather than punt, or cheat, he&#x27;s going to say why, &quot;why?&quot; is tough and that he can&#x27;t satisfy out of respect for a fellow person he would not want to lead astray.  This does require going somewhat astray, but the person will be left with some greater understanding as a consequence, and that is as good as it gets, without actually taking the time to really answer why, which is entirely too much time and outside the scope of the interview mutually agreed upon in advance.<p>That look in the chair, when he sits back and grins a little?  It&#x27;s a challenge.  He&#x27;s opened up a door, and he&#x27;s inviting anyone watching to go right on in.  Think about it some more.  Thinking is good, and down that rabbit hole is where the really good stuff is.  :)  People can get a notch smarter just watching Feynman, and that&#x27;s as he intended.<p>He&#x27;s just precise and he cares about that.

You can often reduce bandwidth requirements by computing more and vice versa.<p>Take Sandy Bridge for example:<p>While L1 and L2 cache sizes are fixed on Sandy Bridge, L3 cache varies between 1 - 20 MB.<p>Clock speeds vary between 1.0 to 3.6 GHz.<p>There are 1-4 memory channels, I believe they&#x27;re usually arranged 64 byte granularity round robin. Say your access pattern is access every second 64-byte cache line vs. access every line. On 1 and 3 channel systems, both perform about same. When skipping 64 byte cache line on 2 channel system, effective memory bandwidth is equal to just 1 channel system. 4 channel system will behave like 2 channel one. The code might be bandwidth bottlenecked on 1-2 channel system and compute bound on 3-4 channel system.<p>Then you&#x27;re going to hit DRAM page miss every... 1-8 kB? System dependant, of course.<p>To make the best choice for Sandy Bridge based systems, among other things, you need to know number of memory channels + their arrangement, amount of L3 cache and clock speed. On some Sandy Bridge CPUs you have a lot of time to do complicated data packing and unpacking, trying to just keep memory bandwidth usage down.<p>That was just one architecture. Now add all the other platforms in the mix. There are pretty many different instruction set extensions. If you don&#x27;t use them properly, you can lose an order of magnitude of performance.<p>I think we&#x27;ll need runtime code generation in the future.

They have difficulty separating an attack on, say, a logical falsehood, from an attack on their character or themselves.  This is doubly true if the other party seems frustrated, which Feynman seems like he might have been - if only a little, and no matter how understandably - because even if you can convince yourself rationally of the difference, you&#x27;re now dealing with emotions, and convincing yourself <i>emotionally</i> of the difference is a whole different - and I believe more difficult - challenge.<p>Especially because they&#x27;re <i>not</i> always separated.

However, I&#x27;ve had the advantage of <i>decades</i> of dealing with this stuff, of dealing with my own mistakes and the mistakes of others, and being frustrated by it, and enjoying the benefits of being corrected.

There&#x27;s a higher sensitivity to social cohesion - likely quite reasonably, as their day jobs value that social cohesion more.

After exactly one year of diet modification alone (I chronically under-exercise), I weighed 214 pounds, and now weigh about 190.<p>I did not reduce my caloric intake, instead I removed all foods that are known to screw with human biology, and decided to follow the Paleo diet: no grains (pasta, bread, cereal, corn, etc), no legumes (peanuts, peas, beans, soy, etc), no seed oils (vegetable oil, corn, canola, soy), no refined sugars, no dairy (to reduce hormone and lactose intake; I limit myself to small amounts cheese and full fat greek yogurt only).<p>What I do eat? Meat, vegetables, fruits, the aforementioned limited fermented dairy, mushrooms, and if I weren&#x27;t allergic to them, I could add nuts to that list as well. I use healthy fats like bacon fat, coconut oil, and olive oil instead of seed oils. I also limit myself to one cup of coffee a day, and sometimes even then I don&#x27;t feel like one, I don&#x27;t really need it anymore.<p>My caloric intake has not really changed (it has always been between 1500 and 2000 a day), yet the fat just melted right off. The whole obsession with caloric intake (unless you&#x27;re clearing 3000 calories with low physical activity) doesn&#x27;t fix obesity: chronically low caloric intake (below 1500 calories for an extended period) makes your body think it&#x27;s starving to death, and it will refuse to release energy from your fat cells and start hoarding it instead.<p>In other words, unsafe caloric reduction for long periods may cause weight <i>gain</i> in some individuals already suffering from some form of metabolic disorder (including prediabetes and diabetes and just being morbidly obese).<p>Yes, I agree there is nothing to really treat: eat foods that promote the proper functioning of your body, drop the ones that are known to cause chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and with grains in particular, the fact they contain phytates and protease inhibitors in very unsafe amounts (both cause malabsorption of nutrients).",1439187409

An ancestor of Djinn is automated theorem proving. Why can&#x27;t machines prove math theorems for us? This quest goes back to the dawn of computing science.<p>2. A more recent development is the Curry-Howard Correspondence. Programming in a (typed) FP language is like playing tetris. Solving symbolic logic problems [1] is also like playing tetris. Djinn exposes the connection in a REPL you can play with. And see how the computer plays tetris for you!<p>3. Don&#x27;t want to install Djinn? No problem, just hop over to the Haskell IRC [2]. Lambdabot has a working Djinn plugin.<p>[0] <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/djinn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/djinn</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/intrologic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/intrologic</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel</a>",1439186424

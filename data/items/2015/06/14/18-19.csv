Votes matter in aggregate, but matter almost not at all individually.<p>The rational course of action is to take the time and effort you&#x27;d put into voting and instead use it to try to convince irrational people to vote for the candidate you want to win. That must have more bang for your buck than voting yourself.<p>Even if you ignore all that, then what exactly counts as voting in accordance with your own views, the facts, and the choices given? Does that mean that you vote for a third-party candidate who closely matches your views but has no chance to win. Does that mean that you vote for the major party candidate who&#x27;s closer to your views than the other one, even though both are distant?<p>And then there&#x27;s the problem that limits on who is allowed to vote have historically always been about oppressing people. For example, it used to be common to forbid illiterate people from voting. Sounds totally fine in the abstract, right? If you can&#x27;t even read, how can you vote intelligently? Except that in practice it ended up being, you&#x27;re the right sort of person (i.e. white) so we&#x27;ll just do this test as a brief formality before you can go vote; you, on the other hand, are the wrong sort of person (i.e. black) so you have to name every single county judge in the state to prove you know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>If anyone thinks we should be testing voters, please outline what kind of testing regime you&#x27;d use to screen out people who believe that, say, the Earth is 6,000 years old, but couldn&#x27;t possibly be used to screen out people who believe that every citizen should be given $10,000/year basic income with no strings attached.",1434307365

9715833,comment,9714964,9715533,0,0,zokier,,,"> The complexity of the problem was increased by the necessity of providing migration paths from legacy encodings to Unicode and back again; without such a guarantee, bootstrapping the world into using Unicode would have been a much more difficult proposition, but that constraint also means that many oddities of legacy encodings have had to be preserved in Unicode in order to be able to preserve that round-trip mapping.<p>While I agree that preserving round-trip integrity was essential for Unicodes success, I&#x27;m not sure if the approach taken to achieve that was the best one. I would have preferred that the complexity tradeoff would have been shifted to software converting between Unicode and legacy encodings by having more complex mapping tables and cleaner code point space.<p>I also think that Unicode Consortium should have been more aggressive in segregating (and discouraging the general use of) legacy compatibility features/codepoints and the stuff that is actually supposed to be used. My personal pet peeve is precomposed characters.<p>In a more general note, I sometimes wonder if it would have been beneficial to have separate layers in Unicode and have more focused on providing generic primitives. As a simple example it is mighty convenient that I can type 2³ = 8 in plain text, but arguably it would be even nicer if instead of special &#x27;SUPERSCRIPT THREE&#x27; codepoint there would be generic superscript modifier codepoint that could be combined with any character.<p>Speaking of superscripts, they demonstrate well one aspect that I dislike in Unicode, the way they have absorbed legacy encodings verbatim. The numeric superscripts (e.g.  ⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶) happen to have inconsistent look on my machine because the superscripts for 1, 2, and 3 are from Latin1 while the rest are in their own block.",1434306289

Here are the three most common:<p>* Freemium - Get users then try to charge them money later<p>* Up front - Get paid by people, then provide them with a game<p>* Ad-based - Get users and then sell their attention to companies<p>The reason why freemium is so popular is that it makes sales  much easier.  Users can try a game with zero risk of spending money on something they don&#x27;t like.  For this reason users are more likely to download your game instead of a paid app.  Once they get hooked, they are more likely to spend money.  I would argue this is a good thing for users and for publishers.  Users have reduced risk and publishers can get in front of more potential customers.<p>Fremium doesn&#x27;t have to be pay-to-win or scammy.  Depending upon your game, you can sell access to more levels, better AI, multiplayer support, new graphic tiles or other items that provide real value without being scammy.  The original Doom worked like this...  The first levels were free, but if you wanted to play the entire game, you had to pay up.  The fact that the first part was free allowed it to spread like a virus and boosted its sales immeasurably.<p>Freemium can be applied to almost anything.  I wrote a book and give away one chapter.  Want the rest?  Time to break open that wallet.  It doesn&#x27;t feel scammy at all.  Folks can read the free chapter and get a feel for the type of content and quality that the rest of the book contains.  Less risk for them, more money for me.",1434306180

Factories need a lot of land, and they don&#x27;t want to pay residential market rates for it, and current owners will want to maintain their property values. In a free market, the self-interest of current property owners and developers tends to self-regulate.

Most DL results look very hacky to me. Someone says Max Pooling works; someone again comes along and says it&#x27;s not necessary. Someone says sigmoid or tanh are the best activation functions; someone else says ReLUs are better. And so on. Why? Why is one better than the other?<p>I&#x27;m no biologist, but I don&#x27;t think our brains are going around trying to do a grid search for the best hyperparameters. Most DL results today are the result of throwing 1000s of Titans on the problem and then sitting back for a week for the beast to cough up a solution.<p>Tangential nitpick: one (very minor) nit I have with Prof LeCun&#x27;s presentations is that I don&#x27;t see him give more credit to Hinton and Schmidhuber. Hinton is mentioned a couple of times (3), but Schmidhuber is totally ignored; for example, when he mentions LSTM, it&#x27;s cited as [Hochreiter 1997], even though it was a join publication with Schmidhuber. It should be cited as [Hochreiter et 1997], as he does in the very next line.",1434305069

They do this because the artificially low housing availability spikes prices. They don&#x27;t actually care about their communities; they just want to keep their houses priced at 5 times what they&#x27;re actually worth.<p>Of course, the breadwinners in those families (who finance the NIMBYs) get some karma when their trophy spouses (the ones pushing the NIMBY rules that prevent new development) give them stupid kids who&#x27;ll require expensive and emotionally exhausting string-pulling in order to get them into schools.

Moving the modifier keys (except for shift) to the thumbs is a huge improvement.<p>The arrow key layout is actually one thing I don&#x27;t like about the default Kinesis configuration (the bottom row for the left hand is backquote, backslash, left arrow, right arrow, and for the right hand it&#x27;s up arrow, down arrow, left bracket, right bracket). I remap these keys to put all the arrows on the right hand (in vi order).",1434304833

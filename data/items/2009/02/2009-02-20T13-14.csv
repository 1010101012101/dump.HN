488661,comment,488518,488518,0,0,speek,,,"As much as TDD irks me to think about when I'm in the middle of a program, it's a very useful thing.<p>Its saved me from making countless mistakes.<p>JUnit isn't good for beginners though, because you have to define an equals method for each class. Not only is that completely repetitive, but it is also very difficult for beginning programmers to write good tests. If you haven't been programming for very long, how do you know how to define equality? Do you consider two objects that have the same fields (only the fields you're testing) to be equal? Or are you checking whether or not two objects are the same (bit for bit in the stack)? What happens when you have super-classes that have less fields than their subclasses?<p>Anyway, one of my professors is working on a new tester for java (<a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/Tester/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/Tester/index.html</a>). It's very elegant; the syntax is very clean:<p>""public void testGresterThan(Tester t){<p><pre><code>     t.checkexpect(7 > 4, true);
</code></pre>

I've been lurking at HN for about a year now and I really enjoy reading everyone's comments/discussions, etc. I've started getting into programming and such over the past year or so, learning mainly Python/Django, along with a bit of PHP and Lisp (Scheme) (I'm slowly working through SICP in my free time), so I'm always learning a thing or two from the discussions here!<p>I've recently decided to take the big jump and leave my corporate job soon to work on some ideas. The main one I've been working on for the past year is related to the music industry, but I'm still working on a few others concurrently.<p>Since I'll have more ""free"" time on my hands in about a month, I would like to spend some of it meeting and interacting with some cool people. I was wondering if anyone knows of some good places in/around Boston to meet fellow hackers/startup founders? I didn't go to school around here, so I'm kind of out of the loop (but would love to get back in it!) but I figured since some of you live here or are familiar with the area, you might know of some places to check out. I'm looking more toward informal environments (as opposed to pitch meetings, VC events, and the like, since I don't have an actual product built yet), though I'd give most events a shot anyway. Also, I'm always looking to meet new people and try new things so if anyone would like to get together in person or otherwise to talk tech, startups, music, or basically anything else, definitely feel free to contact me (e-mail in profile).<p>Thanks!",1235137866

But the ""oral cancer, mouth lesions and rotting teeth"" were enough to dissuade me from tobacco, and the ""jail time"" side effect convinced me to avoid other plants.

Some companies are better at developing the ""tech"", that then can be licensed to multiple user facing companies whose expertise is customer relationships and UI.<p>But the risk for the back end company is that the user facing company owns the customer relationship.

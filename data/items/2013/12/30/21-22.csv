They sell &quot;media&quot; direct to consumer, among other things, and media is an end product.<p>Claiming that Google is an ad company is, similarly, tenable: they sell ads. Showing ads is the end product.<p>You may just have been making a joke, in which case I apologize for the lengthy response, but claiming that a circus is a ticket printing company in no way relates to either argument.<p>Tickets are categorically not a product. Nobody would care if a circus uses tickets or stamps or facial recognition. They are a means to admittance to the end product. The show. That&#x27;s why they bother with the elephants and acrobatics.<p>Google, on the other hand, is in fact an ad company. They sell ads for the vast majority of their revenue. That&#x27;s what they do. They dabble elsewhere and are expanding to new areas which is totally fine. Just look at the history of Nokia--ever heard of Nokia the paper company or Nokia the galoshes manufacturer?<p>However, as a company that is exploding with cash from the ad business, Google has clear priorities. They maintain their current revenue and use their fantastic capital for other stuff that at the very least won&#x27;t hurt that business. More likely, they invest in things that will further it by collecting your information and showing you ads. Like the Chromebook.<p>All that said, the Scroogled campaign is silly and not an effective way to raise that issue.",1388440727

We became profitable immediately; with our profits we both fed ourselves and invested in technology and infrastructure.  We were careful not to overbuild on our way up, though some expenditures (like our 5-year lease) were taken with a leap of faith.<p>Three+ years on, we are a nationally respected financial services firm  (primarily in the valuation niche) with a healthy top (and bottom) line,  and a very happy and dedicated team of seven.<p>Getting out of the Silicon Valley mindset -- Seed/A/B/C/Exit -- has been incredibly liberating.",1388440467

An hijacked flight is very different from other hijaking/terrorist situations. It leaves you with almost no options except maybe to shoot it down. There is absolutely no other tactical moves that can be made. The same cannot be said for similar attacks on theaters/schools etc. A flight is also a moving threat that requires swift response, and it can strike (when used as a weapon) over quite a large area (In terms of targets it may choose).<p>Now, if we as this article suggests remove all security to get on flights. As someone planning such an incident, i.e. pull out a gun or other random acts of terror; It would follow that getting on a flight to do such a thing would be the best move. You literally have access to 200+ people with no where to run in a confined area, with no security. The reason flights are given security vs other places such as theaters etc is not some random act. It is cause of the specific threats that are posed by hijacked flights/weapons on flights that are fundamentally different from other locations.<p>(How fast would the cops get to someone who starts firing at people in any city with such high population density?, now compare that with what happens in a flight, you have no options, and once it starts you practically write off the people who are on the flight because you have no chance of saving them)",1388439763

Of course, with relatively small sample sizes nothing is likely to be proved beyond doubt, but it&#x27;d be interesting to know, and the amount of money needed to test it wouldn&#x27;t be huge, since YC isn&#x27;t making VC-level investments. Of course, it&#x27;s not free or risk-free either, so I could see if they weren&#x27;t willing to test it.<p>I&#x27;ve long wanted to see in general some more experimental testing of selection variations. What if YC (or some other funder&#x27;s) candidates were just selected completely randomly from the applications? What if they were selected solely according to some dumb criterion, like take everyone with the most degrees, or the longest CV, or the most GitHub LoC? What if they were selected purely based on the applications (without the dumb-criterion requirement) but without interviews? For a few tens of thousands of $$, someone willing to try those kinds of things out could get some pretty interesting information on how reliable different selection methods are.<p>My own hypothesis is a negative one: that beyond screening out a few obviously-bad candidates and taking a few obviously-good candidates, the bulk of the YC selection process is randomly related to outcomes, and the YC mentoring/contacts/press/etc., rather than predictive value of the selection process, is the main driver of their generally strong outcomes.

I would be very interested to find out what the Digital Ocean uses for storage.    This does indicate to me that they are using something pre-allocated;  I can&#x27;t think of any storage technology that allows over-subscription that would not also give you zeroes in your &#x27;free&#x27; (un-allocated) space.<p>>For virtual hard disk technology, Hyper-V VHDs do it, VMWare VMDKs do it, sparse KVM disk image files do it. Zeroed data is the default, the expectation for most platforms. Protected, virtual memory based operating systems will never serve your process data from other processes even if they wait until the last possible moment. AWS will never serve you other customer&#x27;s data, Azure won&#x27;t, and none of the major hypervisors will default to it.

VMWare, well... it&#x27;s a very different market.   Same with Hyper-V.    And sparse files, well, as I explained, suck.     (I suspect that to the extent that Hyper-V and VMware use sparse files, they also suck in terms of fragmentation, when you&#x27;ve got a bunch of VMs per box.   But most of the time if you are running VMware, you&#x27;ve got money, and you are running few guests on expensive, fast hardware, so it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.)<p>Most dedicated server companies have this problem.

Your provider should give you some sort of &#x27;rescue image&#x27;  - something you can boot off of that isn&#x27;t your disk that can mount your disk.  Boot into that and scramble your disk before you leave.<p>I know I had this problem, too.. many years ago when I switched from sparse files to LVM-backed storage.  Fortunately for me, if I remember right, Nick caught it before the rest of the world did.   I solved it by zeroing any new disk I give the customer.  It takes longer, especially when I ionice the dd to the point where it doesn&#x27;t kill new customers, but I am deathly afraid (as a provider should be)  of someone writing an article like this about me.    Ideally, I&#x27;d have a background process doing this at a low priority on all free space all the time, but making sure the new customer gets zeroes, I feel, is the most certain way to know that the new customer is getting nothing but zeroes.<p>>Zeroing an SSD is a costly behavior that, if not detected by the firmware, will harm the longevity of the SSD by dirtying its internal pages and its page cache. Not to mention the performance impact for any other VMs that could be resident on the same hardware as the host has to send 10s of gigabytes of zeroes to the physical device.<p>Clean failures of disks are not a problem.   Unless you are using really shitty components (or buying from Dell)  your warranty is gonna last way longer than you actually use something in production.  Enterprise hard drives and SSDs both have 5 year warranties.<p>The dd kills disk performance for other guests on spinning disk if you don&#x27;t limit it with ionice or the like, and that&#x27;s the real cost.  I would assume that cost would be much lower on a pure ssd setup.",1388439363

However some pointers perhaps might make it less painful:<p>> Iterators everywhere are incredibly annoying, especially with my development workflow, where I don&#x27;t put a line of code into a file before I run it manually in the interpreter. When I run a map over a list, I just want to see the freaking results.<p>That&#x27;s what <i>list()</i> is for:<p><pre><code>    >>> list(map(lambda x: x * x, xs))\n</code></pre>\n> Default unicode strings are obscenely annoying to me. Almost all of my code deals with binary data, parsing complex data structures, etc. The only &quot;human readable&quot; strings in my code are logs. Why the hell should I worry about text encoding before sending a string into a TCP socket...<p>> The fact that the combination of words &quot;encode&quot; and &quot;UTF8&quot; appear in my code, and str.encode(&#x27;hex&#x27;) is no longer available, is a very good representation of why I hate Python 3.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand your complaint. If you&#x27;re parsing binary data then Python 3 is clearly superior than Python 2:<p><pre><code>    >>> &quot;Hello, Gådel&quot;.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)\n    b&#x27;Hello, G\\xc3\\xa5del&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nSeems much more reasonable than:<p><pre><code>    >>> &quot;Hello, Gådel&quot;.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File &quot;<stdin>&quot;, line 1, in <module>\n    UnicodeDecodeError: &#x27;ascii&#x27; codec can&#x27;t decode byte 0xc3 in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)\n</code></pre>\nBecause they&#x27;re not the same thing. Python 2 would implicitly &quot;promote&quot; a bytestring (the default literal) to a unicode object so long as it contained ASCII bytes. Of course this gets really tiresome and leads to Python 2&#x27;s, &quot;unicode dance.&quot; Armin seems to prefer it to the extra leg-work for correct unicode handling in Python 3 [0] however I think the trade-off is worth it and that pain will fade when the wider world catches up.<p>> In Python 2, the rule of thumb was &quot;If it makes sense, it&#x27;s going to work&quot;. In Python 3, this isn&#x27;t true. Not often, but often enough to annoy. This makes Python &quot;feel&quot; like Java to me.<p>Perhaps this is because you&#x27;re a used to Python 2 and anything else is going to challenge your perceptions of the way it should work?<p>I don&#x27;t understand the Java comparison.<p>> And worst of all, Python 3 has so many excellent features, like sub-generators, a better performing GIL, etc. These sometimes force me into coding with Python 3. I hate it every freaking time.<p>> I said to myself that with Python 3.4, due to great stuff like the new asyncio module, I&#x27;ll have to make the switch. It&#x27;s really sad that this is because I &quot;have to&quot; do it, and not because I &quot;want to&quot;.<p>Well you can always attempt to backport these things into your own modules and keep Python 2 alive.<p>I think going whole-hog and embracing Python 3 is probably easier in the long run. I&#x27;m not sure how long the world is going to tolerate ASCII as the default text encoding given that its prevalence has largely been an artifact of opportunity. Unicode will eventually supplant it I have no doubt. It&#x27;s good to be ahead of the curve.<p>[0] <a href""http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/7/2/the-updated-guide-to-unicode"" rel""nofollo"">http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/7/2/the-updated-guide-to-unicod...</a>",1388438536

I had enough time to goto my License office to request a temporary which here in Texas means you get a paper ID with your picture on it for 3-5 weeks until the new license arrives.<p>So I showed up with my paper ID and all I had to do was fly from Austin to Miami. I knew the paper ID would get scoffed at but assumed they were well trained in the various temporary/permanent IDs that states provide for emergencies. Ha! I decided to bring my birth certificate, social security card, and a utility bill (my passports expired, else that would have been logical) in the event that TSA had a problem with the paper ID. Figured I&#x27;d go prepared.<p>Well, lo and behold every single TSA agent outside of Texas not only grilled me about the paper ID, they didn&#x27;t care at all about the fact that I also had the other items (birth cert, ss card, util bills). Because I had a temporary ID I was pulled out of every line, called a &quot;No ID&quot; (this became so frequent that I eventually wound up walking up to every agent and stating &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m a no ID, here&#x27;s my paperwork&quot;), privately searched over and over and in two cases missed my flight that I&#x27;d arrived 2-4 hours early for. These were FTL to Austin flights that evidently only happen once or twice a day with the carrier I had my ticket through (Jetblue I think). I wound up in Miami an extra two days and basically lived at the airport at that point. I ALMOST missed my cruise completely, luckily the bulk of my issues were getting BACK home after it.<p>It took that much time for them to decide that I was who I said I am. I would get bounced from agent to agent, each who would personally search me, the one step below strip search search- not the pat on the back type. They&#x27;d offer to do a private search (meaning in the security room) but after mutiple searches in one-two hours I just said screw it, do it here in front of everyone and get it over with. Then I&#x27;d have to wait for a superior to come out and decide whether or not I was legally allowed to pass. The most amazing thing to me was that every single TSA agent seemed like they had NEVER, EVER dealt with a temporary ID before. Like I was this black plague that wasn&#x27;t covered in their rule book at any point in time, or they were told that, my god, if somebody ever shows up with a temporary ID they are CLEARLY up to something.<p>Prior army, raised on Army bases all over the world, I&#x27;ve never felt like such a non-citizen in my life. I have the utmost sympathy for people who are systematically treated poorly by the TSA due to their attire/skin color.<p>I do absolutely everything I can to NOT fly nowadays. I also do not wait in line during Black Friday nor do I wait in line for a fast food restaurant. Those are pretty weak assumptions.<p>I went on a cruise and the Customs officers had absolutely no issue with my temporary license and documentation.",1388438002

How could you accomplish this?

6986920,comment,6985788,6985788,1,0,bobfirestone,,,"I work on a jRuby/Rails project. The most difficult issue with going to jRuby from MRI is c gems. For example if you are using the ruby racer to compile assets you have to swap it out for the java based ruby rhino. If there isn&#x27;t a java version or equivalent then you are pretty much going to have to write it yourself.<p>Writing standard ruby gems make sure you are thread safe and it will run in both.<p>For background jobs look at sidekiq. It plays well with the jvm.<p>Unless you are in love with the JVM I would recommend taking a look at rubinius. It is a ruby implementation written in ruby and C++. I hadn&#x27;t looked at it in a couple of years but the current version has gotten my attention. Just tinkering locally the performance is excellent and no JVM related issues.",1388437311

He presents three possible explanations for the effect that lkrubner discusses.  Nowhere in there is a value judgment, only three hypotheses.<p>A good rule of thumb for when a conversation has become personal and emotions are getting involved is when the word &quot;You&quot; comes up.

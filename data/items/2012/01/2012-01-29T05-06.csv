After a while my two thumbs just start working in synchrony, and it really just feels like using a mouse.<p>in case you are wondering, the mappings are:<p>L1: Right mouse click, R1: Left mouse click, L2: CTRL+SHIFT+TAB (move to previous tab), R2: CTRL+TAB (move to next tab), D-pad Up: scroll up ,D-pad Down: scroll down, D-pad left: ALT+LEFT (back), D-pad right: ALT+RIGHT (forward), Select: ALT+TAB, Start: HOME (home directory), PS: WIN+G (Open Chrome), Triangle: CTRL+W (close tab), Square: CTRL+= (zoom in), Cross: CTRL+- (zoom out), Circle: CTRL+SHIFT+T (restore tab), Left stick click: F5 (refresh), Right stick click: middle mouse click (scroll).<p>EDIT: formatting",1327816760

The technical measures are only to protect a copyright holders ""rights"", but if the copyright law of the land does not recognize a right where such right limits fair dealing (which is identified in the WIPO treaties), then there are no such rights to protect in the first place, and therefore the technical measures clauses don't have standing.<p>Therefore, reverting to Bill C-60 would be the right thing to do.<p>Now to draft a letter to my MP and Senator.",1327816625

3524562,comment,3515845,3516936,2,0,Zancarius,,,"""Pompous?"" Perhaps, but I think you'll agree that there are far more redeeming and clever ways to construct a humorous commentary on the behavior of (for example) an interpreter.<p>To address your particular concern which I feel is somewhat misplaced: I think it would be more pertinent to classify individuals like myself and the others who have complained about the delivery of this particular piece as suffering from less <i>patience</i>, especially with the usage of ""wat"" throughout. There are reasons for this, and it likely depends on an individual's preferences, how one feels about the (mis)usage of language, or the (ab)use of memes to attempt the creation of a witty informational exchange. Note: I realize that I'm probably just <i>slightly</i> outside the target demographic of this video, which probably appeals more to individuals who are in their mid-twenties or younger, and I'm fully aware of this fact.<p>I apologize if I personally came off as a pompous whiner. This particular misspelling of ""what"" is a personal pet peeve that drives me absolutely insane, and it greatly reduces my mental perception of an item's quality (or the quality of an individual's speech). I suppose other complaints probably derive from its delivery as a meme-inspired video, which probably appeals to younger audiences as I've mentioned.<p>In other words: There are legitimate gripes about this form of video. I've seen similar ones that were indeed humorous, but they had a fantastic delivery that was well thought-out. Including a dozen absurd pictures that appear to be sourced from sites like Imgur with ""WAT"" emblazoned on them does not appeal to everyone, and I don't think it's useful to criticize others' opinions of this video as sorely lacking in humor as ""sad"" simply because we all have greatly different tastes and preferences. Moreover, these tastes and preferences are malleable; something you found hilarious when you were 22 might be head-shakingly awful by the time you're in your 30s.<p>I suspect this video is one of these. Save it and watch it again in ten or fifteen years.<p>Also, if you want a good example to serve as a useful benchmark for classical ""hacker humor,"" I present to you this piece: <a href=""http://catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html</a>",1327815947

3524558,comment,3522839,3523727,3,0,6ren,,,"Regarding development burden, if ICS is implemented as <i>additions</i> to the language, then it can get all updates to the rest of CoffeeScript from ""underneath"" - the only proviso is that CoffeeScript syntax doesn't change incompatibly with it. And as ICS can be seen as a simple macro (plus libraries it uses), I would guess it is implemented this way (simple source transform on top of CoffeeScript, not hacking at the Jison grammar).  This is one way around the issue you raise.<p>Regarding the whether it's part of the language or a library as a distribution issue, it depends on what benefits users.  For syntax, there's some benefit in uniformity (other developers can read it).  I'm seeing ICS as a <i>suggestion</i> of a new feature in CoffeeScript. If it's really good (meets a need; bugs and design mistakes are fixable and fixed; it doesn't break other things), it could be back-integrated into CoffeeScript proper. Whether to do so can be better decided once data exists. :-)<p>It's a great forking model for exploring new syntax, IMHO.<p><i>EDIT</i> but it breaks the CoffeeScript philosophy of readable JavaScript, and (eg) addes debug line numbers in to the source code (see ""load"" on the sample code).

However, I don't see how you draw the connection in your first paragraph between breaking into homes and disrupting traffic.

I felt the ad hominem attacks were a little brusque, and while they certainly didn't offend me, I can understand that some would consider his reaction a bit unprofessional.<p>I'd personally reserve a moniker like ""fucking scumbags"" for people who would steal from their family/friends to fuel a coke habit. Or maybe Go Daddy.<p>EDIT: ok, I'll now admit that I misunderstood the term ""ad hominem attack"". A more appropriate definition would be ""overly-generalized insult left open to interpretation"", e.g. ""douchebag"". Something along the lines of ""fucking lazy hack"" would probably have been more accurate.",1327814144
3524516,comment,3522839,3524462,1,0,6ren,,,"Thanks a second time, I'm getting there! I realized one can look at the transformed javascript output, to see just what it does.  The setting of the variable in the <i>defer</i> becomes:<p><pre><code>  $.getJSON(url, __iced_deferrals.defer({
      assign_fn: (function() {
        return function() {
          return json = arguments[0];
        };
      })(),
      lineno: 6
    }));
</code></pre>
Presumably, when 
the function that <i>__iced_deferrals.defer</i> returns is
called by the code in .getJSON that delivers the result, it will set <i>arguments[0]</i> to that result, and then call the <i>assign_fn</i> above. This will set json to that result.<p>Also, I realize that it doesn't set <i>json</i> to the returned value of <i>$.getJSON</i>, as <i>$.getJSON</i> doesn't return anything - it uses a callback to deliver its result. It seems that ICS always works this way - which I guess implies that the use-case it's for always uses callbacks...<p>BTW: I'm not sure why the above has a function which is then called immediately. Maybe a coffeescript thing,  for separating namespaces? I assume the <i>lineno: 6</i> is for debugging - I recall some debate against this. Good to see it got in.",1327814114

There is far less storage required to represent data in a column oriented database due to the ability to compress like data.  This storage benefit is really important when you get to tables, as it means you can hold more of your data set in memory at any one time.<p>2. For tables that have a lot of columns, but queries that only touch a few at a time, it means less work for the query to do, since there is no jumping from row pointed to column pointer.<p>Cheers",1327813855

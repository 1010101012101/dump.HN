This is why the Hubble Constant started off being 150, then was 50, and now hovers around 69. Because everyone did the problem in their own unique way and didn't borrow each other's code and procedures.<p>""there would still be the same number of jobs in astronomy"" - yes, that's the problem, there aren't enough. So the job goes to the guy with the most citations and publications-- I want that guy to be me.<p>""And don't you think if you are using the software from another group you would cite the authors?"" - that's not the whole point. Writing a simulation may take 3 years, then analysis can take another 3 years. If I wrote it, I want first dibs on analysing it, I don't want someone else taking the results I created and publishing them before me.<p>The system is cutthroat, sure, but it does have benefits if you know how to play the game.

5612029,comment,5611702,5611702,4,0,gituliar,,,"I'm a particle physics theorist. In our field there are a lot of open-source (see <a href=""http://www.hepforge.org/projects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hepforge.org/projects</a>), as well as some private projects. I believe that source code should be published/shared in tandem with results it produces. Otherwise, those results have no scientific value and I personaly tend not to trust them, even though they are in agreement with well-known predictions. What matters is an algorithm results are obtained with, not results themselves. In other words, scientists should form a hacker-like community and don't get into the trap of a developer-user relationships where some develop while others use software.<p>I actually wanted to know your opinion concerning the migration of open-source to private software. The most common open-source and free software licenses, like MIT or GNU, allow this kind of migration. That is Bob could modify Alice's public project, produce results, and publish them without sharing sources with anybody. That looks unfair, since Alice did a great job and most likely would like to see the changes. How to protect Alice from such situations? Are there any kind of license which forces to share modified software when some results it produces are published or available to the general public?",1366966257

5612024,comment,5611702,5611985,5,0,anon_barcode,,,"Several reasons.<p>Firstly, it's a boys club up top-- a lot of PhD requirements are build around basically hazing rituals. It's designed to make you ""prove"" yourself-- instead of remembering the Frats founding members, we memorize moments of inertia and rotation matrices, but it's really the same thing, seeing as how I don't deal with those items on a daily basis at all, and a quick duckduckgo will give you more information than I ever could.<p>Secondly, astronomy and astrophysics is arguably the least essential of the sciences, so our funding shrinks accordingly when economies crash (what do we really make, coffee books?). We don't make quantum cryptography, and we can't levitate objects... although we have some remarkably military grade trajectory maps for all your satellites...<p>Thirdly I think it really is an attempt to make us work well past what any other industry would consider remotely acceptable. For a bit of insight into the situation, check this completely serious correspondence sent to an unnamed faculty which is now famous in the astrophysical community: <a href=""http://jjcharfman.tumblr.com/post/33151387354/a-motivational-correspondance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jjcharfman.tumblr.com/post/33151387354/a-motivational...</a><p>I personally work with a 40 year old doctor, a leader in their field, who has not published a major paper in the last 3 years. They're being deported and are moving back in with their family if they can't get a job in the next month or so after having 2-to-3 3-month ""pity"" contracts. Of course this is just a hearsay example, not the norm, but it illustrates.<p>Another thing to remember is that we basically cannot have real families-- our jobs frequently require us to change states or countries at the terminus of our postdocs, and our salaries are on the order of entry position BSc coders 50-80k usually depending on skill. The hotshots in the field get 5-year contracts. At age 30 a 5-year contract is pretty much the best you can possibly do.",1366966171

Astronomers are frequently kept in a state of constant job-induced anxiety by the prevalent practice of fighting for 6 month - 2 year ""postdocs"" for the first 15-20 years of their careers (seriously, go to an astronomical conference, you would not believe the amount of people greying under 35). To ""keep"" your job (in reality, get another postdoc) you must do two things: author papers and get papers cited.<p>This practice makes collaboration actually detrimental to a researcher's career unless one of two things happens: 1) they lead the collaboration and get their name as first author 2) the collaboration allows some kind of recompense for the time invested into the collaboration.<p>For this reason, many collaborations have a period of proprietarity, a time when the collaboration data is available exclusively to the people who have sunk their time into the collaboration. Imagine, if the people behind the Millenium or Aquarius simulations were forced to publish their code as soon as they had run the simulations (this is true for any theorist)-- now these people have spent the past years of their lives, tweaking and perfecting code _for which they get no publications or citations_ and before they can even begin to analyze the easiest results (""low hanging fruit"", the simplistic papers that usually go to collaboration members), the simulations are being run and analyzed all over the world. They have gained nothing by their efforts in actually developing the code (our world does not work like industry, we don't get a pat on the back and a raise for being team players).<p>For theorists, often entire careers revolve around codes that have been developed over the researcher's whole career-- to be forced to hand it over to all the first year PhDs in the world is a tremendous slap in the face.<p>For me, as an ""experimentalist"" (read, data-analyst), I also maintain job attractiveness by having sets of code that no one else has. I'm experienced in a variety of pattern finding algorithms, and have even invented a few myself for very specific problems-- and within my little sphere, people know this about me, I'm the person people come to for certain things. I spent years of my life perfecting these, learning about algorithms, learning the intricacies and quirks of the various datasets we use-- if someone wants to take my place in this community as ""that guy"" then I expect them to devote as much time as I have to learning these techniques inside out and then to do something better than me. I have no desire to pass my code off to a masters student and let him naively plug some dataset into it-- firstly because no one should ever rely on a black box in this field, and secondly because these codes all need to be tweaked to account for the different instruments and data structures being used.<p>Perhaps if my contract didn't have a built in expiration I would be willing to care-bear-share my fractal search methods and spend my Thursday afternoons showing you how to Savitsky-Golay smoothing works, but as long as I'm out of a job next July, and you're the guy applying for my job, you can keep your filthy hands off my code.",1366963643

Whether compatible results can be obtained with independent analyses of the same data is surely an important indicator of success.<p>Of course that should not preclude the possibility of replication as described here.<p>I find the idea of threats to job security misguided.  In the particle physics world some significant code (not everything, granted) has been made available for some time; e.g. Monte-Carlo simulators like Geant or lattice gauge theory codes like those from MILC, SciDAC or FermiQCD.  Even highly optimised code has been available.  Users are requested to cite the authors.  No careers have been harmed, as far as I can tell.<p>Also, the code itself is not much use for replicating results without making the data available too.  This can be more problematic politically and technically, but even here there are good precedents in the particle physics world.",1366963422

But the past event that worries me is the acquisition of face.com. Right after the acquisition, they assured everyone it would stay up and they would continue to support it for all the developers who integrated its facial recognition API into their apps. And just a couple of months later, they announced they would fully absorb and kill it as an independent service. Today, the domain doesn't even lead anywhere. Now I know that the scope and impact of Face.com were way less than those of Parse, but still, you can't blame us for worrying.<p>One thing that would personally reassure me would be for Facebook to add a ""non-hosted"" offering to Parse, which means the ability to download Parse's application and install it on my own server.

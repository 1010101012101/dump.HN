Even Tor hidden services have weaknesses as we&#x27;ve seen recently.<p>At least with anything concerning privacy and security, radical honesty is the best approach. Most people realize nothing online has perfect security or anonymity, you just need to make the case that you have better security and anonymity than competitors in the space. Lots of companies (particularly SaaS providers) make grand claims about their impenetrable security, but only foolish people believe that nonsense.",1448989190

Then I moved to the US and got a new computer - at the same time version 3 came out. There was no way for me to get version 2 back: I tried the old &quot;just re-purchase it and it&#x27;ll end up costing you $0&quot; (which worked for a bunch of other apps - but they were still on the same version). Instead I payed another $70 for version 3. I wrote to Apple and got my money back... but now I&#x27;m stuck with a dodgy version of 3 (that I&#x27;m supposed to delete and  can&#x27;t get updates for) and no way to get 2 back.

It&#x27;s not Apple though, because I don&#x27;t believe they ever said any such thing.<p>The reason Apple has always given is security. This is the reason they gave for not allowing third party access to the JIT version of the javascript engine. Their critics at the time claimed this was really because they didn&#x27;t want other browsers competing with Safari, and they&#x27;d never let anyone have it because of that. Then when Apple developed the XPC framework allowing secure remote execution, they opened up the JIT engine to third party browsers in a secure way.<p>So far Apple&#x27;s actual behaviour has been completely consistent with their stated reasons, which are not the reasons you are &#x27;quoting&#x27; from somewhere, and in several respect contrary to the predictions of their critics. Isn&#x27;t it possible that they are being honest about their motives?<p>But on the other hand, yes, the Mac App Store is a broken mess.

Of course there&#x27;s other issues like what happens when Paddle or Devmate go belly up ande stop processing license activations. But still it takes only a weekend to get it to work and once you get it to run it just works.<p>The real problem though is that the Mac software ecosystem outside the MAS is dead. No user goes to those huge software directory websites anymore (my traffic from MacUpdate & co. is almost zero). (Funnily enough before the MAS went live Apple had a list of OS X software. It was a great source of high quality traffic back then. But it wen&#x27;t offline with the introduction of the MAS).<p>The only way to get your app infront of users is via SEO (which means that you take your eggs from the MAS basket and put them all into the Google basket) or by spending loads of money on PPC ads which won&#x27;t give you a positive ROI because $39 is now considered hugely expensive for software.<p>Social media, blog posts, etc. are all nice in theory but won&#x27;t convert to paying users. You made a funny cat picture that went viral and sends thousands of reddit users to your website? Great, but no one will download your app. They just want the cat picture.<p>The same goes for paying $10k for a blog post over at daringfireball. People will visit your website but won&#x27;t download.<p>Buying ads directly on blogs, forums or twitter/facebook? No one cares for those. You will just lose money.<p>Marketing your own software got really hard nowadays and if you&#x27;re not one of the &quot;famous&quot; developers removing your app from the Mac App Store just means that you will lose most of your revenue.<p>Great for Sketch that they can pull it off.

Well, this is the number one reason.<p>So, at the end of the day, the real reason why FPGA companies don&#x27;t open source their bitstream (and as I said, the actual database) is simply because it will be a major undertaking for them to document in any way that will actually make it possible for the community to use. An FPGA is NOT a processors so it not as easy to document as documenting an instruction set.<p>So, very hard to do, and not enough of a business justification to do so (combined with old school management that don&#x27;t really understand the value of open source).

It&#x27;s a CLI app, yes, but it outshines Thunderbird (and most other GUI clients, for that matter) in a number of ways:<p>- <i>FAST.</i> Mutt lets you process thousands of messages in short order. Mutt is directly responsible for helping me dig out of a 50k deep email hole brought on by years of GMail&#x27;s approach (archive, never delete) in a few days of on-and-off cleanup.<p>- Plays well with others. Uses a bog standard Maildir format that anything sane can read (including Thunderbird, so migration should be easy), provides a very powerful hooking system which can do anything from verifying PGP signatures to checking your spelling before sending to displaying attachments.<p>- Sane defaults. Doesn&#x27;t require a lot of in-depth customization to provide the basics, and the bells and whistles are hardly out of reach.<p>- You have a backup of your mail for free (by using OfflineIMAP)<p>- Not hard to learn (at least for the crowd here). If you can use Vim, you can be using Mutt at full speed in less than a week.<p>- Search capabilities that blow nearly every other project out of the water (regexes with some very cool niceties)[1]<p>- Secure by design. Mails are rendered as plaintext, HTML is decoded by piping messages through a program like w3m. Tracking bugs can&#x27;t do their job, spammers can&#x27;t see that you&#x27;ve looked at their stuff, and you&#x27;re immune to whatever image decoding bugs crop up.

In any case I wholeheartedly agree with standing up for people who are having a hard time. But simply censoring and covering up the darkness will only cause it to fester and grow stronger while the emotional strength of the supposed victim atrophies.<p>This reminds me of a passage from MLK&#x27;s Letter From a Birmingham Jail:<p>>Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: &quot;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.&quot; Was not Amos an extremist for justice: &quot;Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.&quot; Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: &quot;I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&quot; Was not Martin Luther an extremist: &quot;Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.&quot; And John Bunyan: &quot;I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.&quot; And Abraham Lincoln: &quot;This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.&quot; And Thomas Jefferson: &quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .&quot; So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?",1448987888

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic&#x27;s central, highly automated &#x27;biocenter&#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how &quot;identical&quot; reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.

That is if I modify the XML manually and then modify it with a script (assuming the script is written correctly) I can preserve my formatting and my comments. As far as I understand such is not the case with many formats (I suppose YAML would be the exception albeit I&#x27;m not sure if it preserves white space other than the required whitespace).<p>I have actually had this use come up. I had 20 or so Maven POM files that I had to modify/refactor.

I lost my article that clearly explains it but let me summarize. <i>Every company</i> that tried to challenge FPGA&#x27;s or the Big Two went bankrupt or were acquired. The survivors are niche players who might be acquired or go bankrupt at some point. Another one, Tabula, just announced they&#x27;d be shutting down. This is an insanely tough market to get into and stay in.<p>The article explained the reasons were two: I.P. and tooling. Short version for I.P. is there&#x27;s all kinds of stuff integrated with FPGA&#x27;s on many nodes efficiently and you&#x27;ll always have less due to less cash. Far as tooling, vast majority of Big Two&#x27;s expenses are on R&D for EDA tools like HLS and logic synthesis. That&#x27;s the hard part that took them a decade or more to get working enough to be usable as an ASIC alternative or easier to pick up for new HW engineers. You can&#x27;t just duplicate FPGA HW: you need EDA tools to map hardware designs efficiently and correctly to that HW.<p>The I.P. problem is tolerable but the EDA problem isn&#x27;t. There are academic tools to draw on and Mentor even has an FPGA tool that can be re-targeted. Yet, Xilinx and Altera give away most of their tooling free with best stuff dirt cheap compared to six digit EDA tools. The new contender must have FPGA, onboard I.P., and EDA tool that&#x27;s just as effective despite lacking years & hundreds of millions in R&D. Just ain&#x27;t happening. So, the focus has to be on niches Xilinx and Altera haven&#x27;t conquered yet.<p>Now, I do have several business models I&#x27;m tweaking that might allow for a new, OSS FPGA and toolchain with both non-profit and commercial strategies. But you basically need big players individually or in combination willing to loose millions each year to support R&D on it. There&#x27;s also a few firms that short-cut developments whose tools would help a lot. The effort could acquire them. So, there&#x27;s possibilities but it will be a niche, unprofitable market regardless.",1448987059

I can understand it with the iOS to some degree. At least there they are constantly providing new features and hardware changes to help apps keep being innovative.<p>To give an example of the Sandbox issue.<p>We are using AppleScript for some of our logic in the background. Because of the Sandbox every time AS is used a little gear pops up in the top menu of OSX.<p>This started with Yosemite. But worse than that. The implimentation of this security measure was completely sloppy.  The gear didn&#x27;t just appear it also rearranged the top bar icons and I of course got a horde of users complaining. We tried many things to solve this but had to finally give up and just offer MAS users to switch to our non-MAS version.<p>You would think that at least people would be able to turn off such a thing with apps they knew were ok. But no.<p>Furthermore reviews can really make you or break you. For a long time we had good reviews because I spent a lot of time making sure people understood why the spinning gear was there.  But after a while one star reviews started appearing and we had no way of mitigating that or contact the user and tell them they could switch to the non MAS app if they had that issue.<p>And so I finally realized that if you want to actually do any innovation with your apps and built a proper business MAS is not for you.<p>I am beginning to wonder if there is room for an alternate App Store based on the the Developer Certificate or some security setup open sourced.<p>Anyway. My next product wont even be going on the MAS. It&#x27;s simply not worth it. It&#x27;s just a distribution channel for Apple to show their latest features (the only way you get featured)",1448986281

The authors concluded that these flaws make it &quot;highly likely that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is underestimating rape and sexual assault.&quot;[5] The NCVS also differs from other studies by including off campus students among its statistics. Since the risk of assault is higher for students living on campus, the 0.6% reported assault rate is lower than rates reported for campus environments.",1448986251

10656316,comment,10655853,10655853,0,0,milen,,,"Apple has completely lost the goodwill of Mac developers. The one and only reason the ones that haven&#x27;t gone bankrupt are still staying is because they have no other choice due to platform lock-in. Every single conversation that I&#x27;ve had with indies recently have gone along the same lines: Apple is killing the indie scene.<p>I wrote about the MAS exodus [1] more than a year ago and people were skeptical back then. Think again - here&#x27;s a list of great apps [3] that are only available outside the MAS. Those are not just small time hobbyist apps - those are professional tools.<p>Pieter (founder of Bohemian, company behind Sketch) listed many problems with the MAS at a recent conference [5]. Wil Shipley (well-known within the community) has also written about it [6].<p>And now you have another flagship OS X app ditching the MAS due to the multitude problems it creates. The message is loud and clear - if you&#x27;re a real software business, not a hobbyist at home, don&#x27;t waste your time with the MAS - it simply does not allow you to run your busienss properly.<p>When the companies building the flagship apps for the platform publicly state they cannot do business due to the restrictions of the Mac App Store and then abandon the dysfunctional virtual marketplace, then you know Apple have pushed them beyond the edge. No company would just decide to leave the MAS unless the situation is hurting them significantly and holding them back. And unfortunately, there are almost no words to describe how bad the MAS has been for the ecosystem and innovation on the platform. [2]<p>You also get ridiculous stuff like Intuit because of the limitations [4].<p>Even if Apple fixes the Mac App Store one day, which is highly unlikely given that in 5 years they have done absolutely nothing, developers have been burned once and will be skeptical. You know, the whole &quot;Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me&quot;.<p>When people say that everything is fine and dandy with the MAS, they seem to be misguided - no one is asking Apple to make everyone a millionare. Developers are asking for Apple not to force simplistic business models and allow companies to have the ability to choose what works for them.<p>I used to be hopeful for years but no more. I have zero faith that Apple will listen to indies and solve their problem, they&#x27;ve got no leverage. And that&#x27;s a real pity. Instead of pairing high quality hardware with high quality software, we have a platform encouraging predatory tactics and milking of customers. A truly sad situation. And that&#x27;s a real shame because the platform I love and have invested a decade in deserves better. It might even be too late - the damage to developers has been enormous.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.helftone.com/mac-app-store-the-subtle-exodus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.helftone.com/mac-app-store-the-subtle-exodus/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/12/no-one-minding-the-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/12/no-one-minding-the-store/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dancounsell.typed.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dancounsell.typed.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-sto...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from-mac-app-store-to-direct-updates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://twitter.com/tmaes/status/657213874970763267"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/tmaes/status/657213874970763267</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/669321851793879040"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/669321851793879040</a>",1448985683

I would think this is reason enough to summarily dismiss these &quot;everything&#x27;s a TM&quot;-style arguments you&#x27;re making here. The authors of the paper you cited are only not using separation logic in a kind of meaningless sense IMO.<p><i>> So far, I don&#x27;t see why I should.</i><p>This sentiment kind of reminds me of people who have never typeset mathematics complaining that LaTeX is useless... which is to say, perhaps you simply aren&#x27;t interested in and so don&#x27;t care about the use cases where Coq shines? Lots of people -- including me -- have already pointed out a lot of these use-cases in this comment section.<p>But really, based on the arc of this conversation, I would be enormously surprised if you chose to use Coq to prove X, even if there were a proveX tactic already written in Coq and the TLA+ implementation would take all day ;-)",1448985663

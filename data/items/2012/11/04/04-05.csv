In the case of deflation, the Federal Reserve expands the money supply to counteract disincentive to invest. Unfortunately, the Fed often overshoots and ends up causing inflation instead since it's very hard to predict exactly how much is necessary. The Fed's job is not to pick winners and losers; it's just to keep the monetary base stable so that individuals can make investments without having to anticipate changes in the value of the currency.",1352004927

I'm merely pointing out that we may find that we have fewer tablet vendors in 5 years than we have today - the opposite situation from what we would want to happen.<p>In terms of the Amazon tablets, they are selling them at cost (they've explicitly said this) and it will take time to see whether they make back the money they spend on shipping, warehousing, R&D, etc. via content.  It may be a model that others adopt to provide competitor tablets.  It could also lead to a duopoly of Apple and Amazon on tablets.  That would be bad.  It could lead to Amazon getting further leverage over publishers and consumer prices.  Also bad.<p>The thing is that bad behavior isn't without precedent.  Standard Oil sold at below cost in a market to make the competition exit.  When the competition was gone, they would raise prices significantly.  So, in the short term you could get cheaper gas, but in the long run, you removed the competition.  And sometimes we do regulate bad behavior.  We did it with Windows and in the absence of Android, we might be considering it against Apple.<p>I'm not saying that I'm a fan of intervention or that companies can't attempt a console-style business model for tablets.  I'm just suggesting caution in a developing industry that many see as a future of computing: one where we'll want competition and innovation, not for most players to exit before it even takes off.  Low prices are a good thing, but let's not get ahead of ourselves and happily applaud low prices into an oligopoly.  We want cheap prices that can be sustained and innovated on.  Maybe these tablets are going to hit that.  But there are some signs that might not be the case given LG's exit, the fact that Moto and HTC don't have recent offerings, the general mediocre financials of Amazon, Moto, HTC, LG, and Asus, etc.  Then again, maybe that will turn a corner in the near future and I'm worrying for nothing and we'll have an awesome, cheap, competition-filled future.",1352004876

Not too low to devastate competition, not too high to be unaffordable.<p>The idea of efficient prices ties up a lot of concepts, especially anti-trust concepts. You're really spot on. Consider though that there's a whole body of language that specifically outs Amazon and Google's behavior as plain anti-trust violations. E.g., Amazon bundling its book marketplace with a tablet sold below cost; Google bundling its search and advertising business on an operating system sold at inefficient cost (by sharing ad revenues on partnered devices, Google is essentially paying manufacturers and carriers to use Android).<p>How does Apple compete against tablet undercutting? How does Microsoft compete against operating system undercutting? Maybe the parameters have changed, and we should embrace the ""better way of doing it without extracting that much payment from end users.""

It doubled its spending on Google paid search advertising in the last five months.""<p>Google knows this and they have an incentive to move ""commercial"" sites towards AdWords and move ""informational"" sites higher in the organic results. The benefit is engineers can claim they are providing a better end user search experience while AdWords can make even more money.<p>The bigger problem is that the top 10 on a search string can be very arbitrary. What should be the top ten for the search term ""shoes""? Wikipedia? Zappos? Local shoe stores? A blog about shoes? Are the top 10 the top 10 because they should be there or simply because Google put them there?<p>Nextag is an example of a company built on a platform (Google organic search results) that is somewhat hostile to Nextag's business. It's similar to the whole Twitter client app situation. Nextag needs Google, but Google doesn't need Nextag.

4738966,comment,4738588,4738810,6,0,itp,,,"Maybe you can help me understand this analogy a little better. You say that it's similar to when Microsoft decided to bundle IE into Windows, but the comparison isn't totally obvious to me at first blush.<p>Microsoft went to great (and often illegal?) lengths to prevent customers from considering or being able to make use of alternatives. Consumers had a great deal of lock in -- a user of a Windows computer often had software that would only be compatible with a new computer that also ran Windows, for instance. And Microsoft was able to use that leverage to acquire and keep users of its browser software.<p>Google doesn't seem to be following that pattern, as far as I can see. Users can (and do) make use of Google services from non-Google platforms. Google makes its products available to people using browsers other than Chrome, phones other than Android, etc. Performing a Google search requires no account.<p>I use Google for a lot of services, and I certainly don't want a lesser quality site at the top of my search results. I haven't seen that, either. I _have_ seen Google augment its already stellar services with new features that enhance my experience, and I ignore those things that haven't. If I ever find myself unable to ignore or disable things, I'll probably switch to another search engine. Which I'm free to do, since my use of the internet isn't controlled by Google!<p>You make some assertions that I'm just not seeing the evidence for, but I'd like to hear more about them. It seems uncontroversial that users don't want lesser quality search results. Where is the evidence that they are seeing them? And if they are, why aren't they switching to a different search engine? Why should Google have to separate their ""core"" search business from their other ventures right at a time when the expanded product (things like Google Now) is proving just how revolutionary a next-generation, personalized, multi-source search agent can be?",1352004328

4738955,comment,4738355,4738355,7,0,programminggeek,,,"This is one part of Apple's model that I swear people just don't get at all. Apple, as a company, refuses to operate in unprofitable hardware markets. So, they make a $329 7"" tablet instead of $199. They make a $400 tablet with ""outdated"" hardware, they make a $500 tablet that is top of the line. They won't sell a sub $999 laptop.<p>Apple then focuses on selling as much of those products as they can irrespective of market share. They don't deep discount just to gain ""mindshare"" or ""marketshare"".<p>Engadget and others could moan that it isn't fair, but to be fair the only company that has been able to build and sell even remotely comparable hardware at comparable margins is Samsung, and frankly that is largely because Samsung supplies the same parts to Apple, so Apple is effectively subsidizing Samsung's overhead.<p>Other companies could play Apple's game, there certainly is room to do so, but it is a low volume/high margin strategy traditionally.

4738946,comment,4738355,4738778,19,0,mdasen,,,"I think part of the disconnect here is phones vs. tablets.  Intuitively, phones seem to have kept a premium price probably being propped up by carrier subsidies (in the States).  However, there's a part of the link you provided that sounds a bit hollow.  <i>We simply believe theres a better way of doing it without extracting that much payment from end users, because there are other ways to drive revenues.</i>  That line in particular basically says, ""we'll find other ways to get margins off of consumers"".  It also rings slightly hollow in that Motorola is losing money, LG just swung to profitability this quarter after losing money for a few years (as well as exiting the tablet market because of the inability to profit), and HTC has seen its ability to profit plumet.  There are certainly inefficiencies and some companies have kept good margins (Apple and Samsung), but it's not as if most players are doing so well.<p>In tablets, we see really hard price competition.  Amazon is selling the Kindle Fires at cost.  In short, tablets are cheaper than phones with much smaller displays and smaller batteries.  In a certain light, why is the Nexus 4 a full $150 more than a Nexus 7 (assuming the same 16GB storage)?  Sure, miniaturization probably has to do with the cost difference,<p>Also, I think the comparison to laptops might not be so great.  Ultrabooks aren't doing so well and we've seen huge consolidation of competition in the PC/laptop market.  Heck, we nearly saw HP leave the market.  Dell generates less than 5% of its income from the consumer market.  Yes, we have some Ultrabooks coming in, but they aren't selling so well and seem more driven by Intel than by the manufacturers (excluding Apple here).  In a lot of ways, Laptops are actually showing how this is a problem: I hate that 1366x768 resolution, but everyone uses it because it's cheap and everyone is focused on price.  Yes, I can spend over $1000 and get a nice resolution, but there's this gap in the middle.  I remember reading an article lamenting how Dell would try every couple years (in a half-hearted sense) to create a MacBook Pro competitor line just to get hit by a complete lack of sales as people only cared about price.  And that's ok in a certain way, but it also leaves little room for innovation and risk taking (what Engadget was commenting on).  If I want a Windows version of a MacBook Pro 15"", what is there?  Certainly, there is no Retina MBP competitor.  Really, I don't want Apple to take the high end and have every Android vendor compete on price alone like laptops devolved into.  Heck, laptop vendors compete so much on price that poor quality keyboards and trackpads are the norm.  Any hidden place they can save a cent gets hit.  I'm sure the Nexus devices have fine touchscreens, but if price becomes the <i>only</i> object, things like the touchscreen quality could get hit in the future.  We want the lowest price for good stuff.  It's easy to read processor and RAM specs, but we also want to make sure that the non-listed stuff works well.  And we want to make sure that we don't get to a point where we aren't improving because we've programmed ourselves to be so cheap that we won't spend an extra $15 for something much nicer - I feel that way about trackpads.<p>We'll see over the coming years how it all plays out, but LG already exited the tablet market.  Motorola's last tablet was a year ago?  There certainly are vendors struggling and some giving up.  That's not to say that there isn't some bloat in there and not efficiencies to be had.  Google is a great company - great companies push the bounds.  At the same time, I'd like to be sure that the level of competition will stay high - that there will be many companies able to remain competing.  It's hard for us on the outside to be commenting because we don't have complete information.  Google is saying things to the effect of, ""well, prices are sorta coming down and we think we can make up the money in other ways like making sure that people continue to think of Google for search"".  According to the link, even Google's Motorola division seems to think Google's vision for pricing isn't quite fully realizable.<p>You might be totally right and in 5 years we'll have awesome competition at better price points than we have now and I'll have been the silly spoil-sport raining on the parade.  I was mostly trying to point out that these prices may not be sustainable (at the same time, they may well be).  Even if companies aren't purposefully trying to corner the market or anything, this could happen.  Amazon might think that they'll make $x off of content for each Kindle Fire only to find out that people just don't buy on them, but were buying them on price alone.  Then, a few years later when many companies leave the market due to price, we're left with less competition.  Low prices are certainly good.  We want to make sure that the prices and innovation keep going into the future.",1352003575

Changing the entire time-and-capital structure of an economy is Serious Business and is going to be utterly unpredictable (if it were predictable things would be more stable. They're not).<p>Now, suppose it turns out to be a dumb decision. For example, say that some unforeseen feedback loop pops up between overdraft facilities and capital now sitting long-term because of tax changes. Suddenly overdrafts become even more difficult for small businesses to obtain and voila, new cash crunch.<p>Even if it does more harm than good, you've created a powerful constituency for it. Bond market funds, index funds etc are now all in favour of the new tax rules and will lobby with great vigour to keep it.<p>Now, this is true of every tax ever. But the reason economists counsel against taxing <i>for non-revenue policy purposes</i> is because every tax has externalities that are unrelated to the direct incidence of the tax. You want to minimise those as much as possible.<p>Incidentally, the tax system already has consequences. For tax reasons that I simply don't understand, Australian corporations tend to be keen on paying healthy dividends and American corporations focus more on driving up the stock price.<p>> But that is only a mechanical property of the progressive tax scheme (lower tax for lower incomes), which makes the redistributed money more likely to be spent<p>The Australian experience has been that instead of spending the money, Australians are using it to pay down debt. Fine as far is it goes, but hardly the pump-priming that everyone was hoping for. There has been a seismic shift in debt/spending preferences across the population.<p>> but a new kind of shock based on a slowdown of the progress of technology<p>The long term trend of American GDP is stunningly linear[1] (edit: log linear -- actually exponential, I fail graph-reading forever); the only real deviation in the past century has been the Great Depression and WW2, a pair of connected economic earthquakes. We're talking about the 120 year period which included the widespread use of radio, television, highway systems, air travel, computers, the internet, modern medicine including antibiotics ... the list of literally <i>revolutionary</i> changes that quickly become blas is very long indeed.<p>Yet what we see today as monstrous fluctuations are within trend.

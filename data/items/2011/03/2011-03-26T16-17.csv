2372556,comment,2372096,2372330,23,0,jseliger,,,"<i>So, glibc changes, breaks adobe, and it is adobe's fault?</i><p>This reminds me of Joel Spolsky's article, ""How Microsoft Won the API War:""<p>""There are two opposing forces inside Microsoft, which I will refer to, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as The Raymond Chen Camp and The MSDN Magazine Camp.<p>Raymond Chen is a developer on the Windows team at Microsoft. He's been there since 1992, and his weblog The Old New Thing is chock-full of detailed technical stories about why certain things are the way they are in Windows, even silly things, which turn out to have very good reasons. . .<p>The other camp is what I'm going to call the MSDN Magazine camp, which I will name after the developer's magazine full of exciting articles about all the different ways you can shoot yourself in the foot by using esoteric combinations of Microsoft products in your own software.""<p>He thinks the MSDN camp won, and that's bad, and he contrasts with, say, Apple in historical times:<p>""A lot of developers and engineers don't agree with this way of working. If the application did something bad, or relied on some undocumented behavior, they think, it should just break when the OS gets upgraded. The developers of the Macintosh OS at Apple have always been in this camp. It's why so few applications from the early days of the Macintosh still work. For example, a lot of developers used to try to make their Macintosh applications run faster by copying pointers out of the jump table and calling them directly instead of using the interrupt feature of the processor like they were supposed to. Even though somewhere in Inside Macintosh, Apple's official Bible of Macintosh programming, there was a tech note saying ""you can't do this,"" they did it, and it worked, and their programs ran faster... until the next version of the OS came out and they didn't run at all. If the company that made the application went out of business (and most of them did), well, tough luck, bubby.<p>To contrast, I've got DOS applications that I wrote in 1983 for the very original IBM PC that still run flawlessly, thanks to the Raymond Chen Camp at Microsoft.""<p>The thing is, Apple is still mostly like that. Want the new hotness? Upgrade. I've been using OS X since 2004 and have trouble remembering all the stuff that broke because of OS updates (NetNewsWire and printing were particularly common). I don't know if it's because of the MSDN camp in Apple, but I do find it ironic that you cite things breaking as a reason <i>to</i> move to Apple. There are plenty of them, but I'm not sure that's one.",1301158758

Really good advice for someone about to start is to explore ahead before getting bogged down in the exercises for a particular section, like the metacircular interpreter and the compiler. I think the end of Chapter 2 also requires some destructive put/get functions which aren't introduced until Chapter 3.<p>I'm reading Christian Queinnec's Lisp in Small Pieces now, and I think it's a great next book after SICP. It picks up right away with a metacircular evaluator very similar to the first one in Chapter 4, but diverges from SICP to explore different semantics, like Lisp-1 vs Lisp-2, dynamic variables, exceptions and control flow with catch/throw and continuations. Later chapters address macros and compilers I think one to bytecode and another to C.<p>It's very well written and the translation from French is clear if a little bit flowery. Highly recommended, but watch out for the Scheme code from the author's site. I don't think it's been touched since the early to mid 90s and I had a rough time trying to get it to run in any ""modern"" Scheme. I'm just translating the code as I go to run in Racket, which is much easier than trying to figure out what a thousand line Makefile does, or re-write some strange non-hygienic macros.

This isn't quite the windows/mac application versus web debate of the web 1.0 days.  The appstore model significantly lowers the barrier of app consumption found in the old app distribution models, and brings the total distribution ""cost"" to be at least on-par with web apps, with a couple significant advantages.<p>Appstores provide near instant consumption, virtually eliminating the distribution inefficiencies of retail purchases.  They also solve the payment (and collection) problem.  Apple shares the same advantage that Amazon has in online shopping, as they already have my credit card, so purchases are just easier when going through Amazon, and Apple with the AppStore.<p>The appstore app model also provides an ongoing consumption advantage over web apps, as direct integration with the device provides unique to maintain engagement over the long term.  Notification features will keep customers returning to your app.  Also, presence on the home screen is like a built-in advertisement for your app.  While you can add icons for web pages, its not typically used by most consumers.<p>I do recognize that developing to HTML5 instead of the specific mobile platforms can save the developer a lot of time, but it doesn't matter.  Its all about the customer.  Whichever model provides the superior overall consumption experience will win.<p>Who knows what the future brings, but the argument provided by the author is void of true analysis of the dynamics at play, and uses an imperfect historical comparison as a means to justify his view.",1301156986

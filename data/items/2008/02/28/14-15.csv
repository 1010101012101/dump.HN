125464,comment,125353,125353,0,0,gruseom,,,"The web app I'm working on has pretty stringent performance requirements, so we do a lot of profiling in browsers (specifically FF and IE). DOM manipulation and rendering are order(s) of magnitude slower than virtually anything in plain Javascript. This has been so consistent that we've taken it as a design axiom to do as close to everything in pure JS as possible.<p>From this perspective, Resig is understating his point. Optimizing JS alone isn't going to deliver much; it's not close to being the bottleneck.",1204210474

It seems more like a managerial accounting question.<p>First off, for every new customer, you should have built in metrics to figure out where they came from.  For instance, use a different number on your direct mail pieces, use trackable order links in your e-mails and PPC campaigns.<p>Secondly, place a system to automatically follow up with existing customers.  E-mail power user tips after 15 days,  Phone call after 45 days of use to gauge satisfaction, etc.    For gauging customer satisfaction, you get more useful feedback from someone on the phone than filling out a survey.",1204209982

125440,comment,125317,125348,0,0,ilamont,,,"Location is important, as well as talented faculty and networking opportunities, which gives these three schools an edge.<p>But it's a mistake to think that these places have a monopoly on ideas or are stepping stones to great things in this business. A lot of Ivy Plus types get admitted to Harvard or Stanford on the basis of strong standardized test scores, which are <i>not</i> a good indicator of creativity. I know of a late '90s Harvard College CS grad who hasn't done anything remarkable with software development or Web technologies. An MIT grad I briefly worked with had some interesting insights, but many of her ideas came from other people.<p>It's also important to recognize that someone with skills and a great idea can develop very special technologies no matter where they are studying CS -- or even if they are not formally studying anything. Shaun Fanning didn't come up with Napster at Harvard, he developed it at his dorm room at Northeastern. Jaron Lanier (the guy who coined the term ""virtual reality"" and developed many early applications) was a student researcher at New Mexico State University before heading off to the Valley.<p>Bottom line: Seek out those schools with great faculty and programs that interest you, but remembver that success depends on the ideas bouncing around your head, not the name of the university on your resume.",1204207978

The outlook integration has made it easy to bake into everyday processes (along with xobni for search etc).<p>That said ideally we would like to see something more holistic from CRM.<p>It seems most ""CRM"" products are really just great at sales pipeline management, and dont really cover the end to end business efficiency features we really need...<p>Eg Cross Channel Marketing Conversion linked into the sales pipeline management as well Project management, Timesheets, Invoicing, Profitability Reporting, Customer satisfaction surveys etc<p>Solving the problem of how to best acquire customers is a great problem fix, but it creates a whole new bunch of problems around making sure you actually have really happy customers that are profitable to you (which is just as important to success and may be even harder to get right)<p>Anyone have any reccomendations for this?",1204207754

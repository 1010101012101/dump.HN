The PageDown key on my keyboard is much lighter than all the other keys, it feels really mushy and doesn&#x27;t have the same tactile feedback that it&#x27;s supposed to have. All the other keys are fine. I can live with it, but I never saw such an issue with any of the Model M keyboard I&#x27;ve used.<p>Also, their USB firmware sucks. Sometimes it won&#x27;t work during bootup (say, if I want to go into the BIOS or pick something from the GRUB menu), and only gets properly initialised when I get into linux or windows. This only happens sometimes. Other keyboards work consistently, and the problem disappears if I plug the unicomp into a KVM switch that actually shows up as its own HID device instead of just switching the USB ports around. I&#x27;ve seen other keyboards with similar problems but for such an expensive keyboard, it&#x27;s really quite annoying.",1444064288

I have posted it before, and I will dig out the link, (<a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2014/11/20141124t1830vSZT.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2014/11/20141124t18...</a>  ) but listening to the folks who built the WTO and their views on the current rounds is salutary.<p>The gist of the podcast (from memory)<p>- Fair Trade is good for us all<p>- Global trade agreements benefit the poorest the best because if everyone is included, it&#x27;s rare for the clauses to include &quot;screw those guys over&quot;. Small poor countries usually get screwed over because all the effort goes into the big agreements between big trading partners (naturally). Global agreements usually get you the same good deal as Canada gets.<p>- we have mostly solved tariffs on traditional physical goods. The WTO has done a good job on this. It seems a bit self congratulatory.<p>- the TTP and TTIP (Pacific and Atlantic) are best we can do after WTO Doha talks basically collapsed.  Global is better.<p>- In general negotiations proceed to move standards upwards - European Chicken farms are fine for me in the UK but apparently the US consumers think we grow our chickens in faeces.  As such the standards negotiated usually end up being the higher of the two, not the lower.<p>- TTP and TTIP should never be negotiated in secret.  Most of WTO was not and it is a political failure to do so.  But the outcomes probably won&#x27;t change much as frankly it&#x27;s not that interesting to follow trade negotiations<p>The upshot is the old guard of WTO basically announcing that the politicians set the stall out badly and should reboot, but the general direction is positive, that there should be a general default to take the &quot;highest quality&quot; standard in any negotiation.<p>So please when seeing the phrase &quot;negotiated in secret&quot;, see where it sits in the history of WTO negotiations, and pester congress not to kill it off for cheap political points but to pay more attention to their guidelines next time round - and damn well make sure the whole world is included, not half and half solutions.",1444064192

Consider historical figures[0][1]. Between 1950s and today smoking rates in US dropped from around half of the population to around one in five person. Have the citizens of US suddenly became less gullible, or did their lives became less stressful? Or maybe as smoking changed from being a social custom to something despised (which can be partially attributed to regulations, though some would say[2] they were just following the social trend), 90% of smokers quit.<p>Manufacturing a social custom is hard, but if you can pull it off, it&#x27;s basically a superweapon. People will buy not because it&#x27;s good or needed, but because it&#x27;s expected. De Beers has managed to do that for diamonds[3] decades ago, and guess what people are still buying for engagement rings.<p>That&#x27;s only one, albeit an extremely effective way to trick people into parting with their money. There are others. Different people have different needs so if they avoid one trap, they&#x27;ll trip on another. Sometimes the traps are less obvious. Let me give you an example.<p>I can honestly say there&#x27;s no advertising that could convince me to chose the grocery store on my street over the one little further but much cheaper. And yet I often shop in the former one because they employ mostly nice, pretty students, and I love to chat with them. Simple as that. I&#x27;ve bought many things I didn&#x27;t need only to have a pretext to go there and talk with the crew. I&#x27;ve made friends with the entire staff, hell, I met my SO there. But the point still stands that I&#x27;ve been tricked into economically worse option by a simple management decision of hiring nice girls. <i>Everyone</i> has their weak spot.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig...</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762370.html</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/82feb/8202diamond1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/82feb/8202diamond1.ht...</a>",1444062744

Without the actual content of the calls you don&#x27;t know if somebody is talking to a collaborator or ordering in.<p><i>>Also, &quot;reliability&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense as a reason to centralize skype.</i><p>I&#x27;ve written a P2P app or two. The NAT issues that you handwave are a huge problem. It&#x27;s not just the connectivity of nodes, it&#x27;s the symmetry in which nodes are reachable. NAT and general internet weirdness make this a much harder problem than it needs to be. I had to do a significant re-architecting when I ran into these issues during internal testing, and I had less than two dozen users!<p>The next problem is latency. By the time you wait to discover a suitable supernode and for your &quot;hello&quot; message to reach your target peer, you will have already connected and started communicating with your peer if you use a centralized &quot;registry&quot; server.<p>This is compounded by churn. Even if there&#x27;s a single intermediate hop in your routing, your chances of a successful message delivery drop drastically when a peer can leave anytime. Think about how you use your laptop and how long you keep it running and how abruptly you close it. The move towards laptops away from desktops means average node uptime is reducing sharply, without even considering the move to mobile.<p>This is further compounded by the need for presence for the case of Skype. You don&#x27;t want to find a peer is unreachable <i>after</i> you start a call. This implies the need for a global state. But without central server, this can only be achieved with DHT, where the first two problems are even worse. Note the existing DHTs are all used for long running &quot;sessions&quot; where the session is the availability of a torrent. User presence is a lot more ephemeral.<p>And there&#x27;s the original problem for P2P apps, of course: bootstrapping. Peers don&#x27;t come online knowing all their other peers on the Internet. There has to be a way for them to discover each other, which, without Internet-wide multicast, means a central server. If you&#x27;re going to have to solve this problem, you might as well solve the others.<p>There is actually a thread on p2p-hackers mailing list about this exact issue. Many experienced P2P devs agreed that whenever you can get away with a centralized solution, you should go for it. In this context, partially centralizing Skype as they did makes complete sense.",1444061940

Sarah has done more than <i>anyone</i> else I can think of to improve that culture, and I have more respect for her than any ten kernel developers who only know how to hack on code and not on culture.

I put up with it because I want to affect the direction of the kernel as well as the culture of the kernel, and because the main long-term way to affect either of those is from within that culture.

10332669,comment,10320551,10322214,0,0,felixgallo,,,"First, a correction -- the only known-good implementation of Raft is actually in Coq (<a href=""https://github.com/uwplse/verdi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/uwplse/verdi</a>), which predates Idris (which intends to be an easier-to-use Coq).<p>So the problem with distributed consensus algorithms is that they are hard to understand.  It didn&#x27;t help that Lamport wrote his original paper playfully, using a complex and unfamiliar metaphor.  But as a result, many implementations of the relevant algorithms tend to miss complex edge cases.  Even famous ones that many large companies rely on have either had meaningful serious bugs or have been misunderstood and misused by downstream applications.<p>There are a couple of ways to try to fix this.  The common way is to try to write a bunch of unit tests.  This doesn&#x27;t work.  Unit tests test only those things that your tests manage to cover, and you will probably not think of all of the edge cases.<p>The next most common way is to use something like QuickCheck, which automatically generates millions of cases and spends as long as you want (days, hours, weeks) hammering your code.  This is much better, but still nondeterministic.<p>The better way is to go fully deterministic, and prove out that your algorithm works, either by exhaustively checking all possible interleavings (code paths) with a model checker, or by mathematical proof.<p>Historically, the model checkers (e.g. Spin or Groove) have used a pseudolanguage that you describe your algorithm in, which is then exhaustively run to completion.  This approach can prove that you are on the right track, but since you cannot run those pseudolanguages in production, they are not the complete solution, because you must then translate the pseudolanguage into source code of your chosen language.  This is nontrivial and very frequently there are subtle transcription errors.<p>An alternative approach is to use a model checker that uses your native language directly; e.g., Erlang has the brilliant Concuerror program, which instruments your actual code.  This is great because if it can verify that your code works properly, then you are done; no transcription is needed.  Nevertheless I don&#x27;t believe there are yet any Concuerror-assisted public distributed consensus algorithms, even in Erlang.  I would love to be mistaken on this point.<p>The last approach is to take a proof assistant language like Coq or Idris, and formally prove out the properties of the algorithm using mathematical proof techniques.  This is probably optimal, because the exhaustive model checkers can, with complex/slow enough algorithms, run forever or run out of memory trying to test all the cases.  However, Coq and Idris are not exactly popular languages and at this time it&#x27;s not easy to implement line of business applications with them.  So although there is a proven, correct implementation of Raft in Coq that guarantees linearizability, good luck accessing it.  If you don&#x27;t use Coq, then you&#x27;re forced to transcribe it to your chosen language, which, as before, is error prone and does not result in a proven implementation.<p>It would be possible to mechanically transcribe Coq/Idris code into a more common language while maintaining its provability, but to my knowledge that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.  More likely is that Idris and its successors inherit mainstream language features and start making inroads.<p>Note also that maybe you don&#x27;t care about being correct. For example, in the spirit of moving fast and breaking things quickly or whatever, at least one major notable VC-funded project in the news has taken the approach of just increasing timeouts in order to mask bugs in their implementation.  And 99.999% of the time that will probably work fine, just as centralizing your database into one king-hell instance and just dealing with downtime every blue moon will probably be fine too.

7211027,comment,7210064,7210752,11,0,makomk,,,"So, I used to vaguely help develop another proposed init replacement a few years ago, and it&#x27;s entirely correct. The only way to upgrade init is to have it dump state and re-exec() itself, and there are theoretical failure modes that will cause init to crash before it&#x27;s even possible to set up a crash handler to catch the problem, causing a kernel panic.<p>What&#x27;s more, supporting upgrades this way means you need to support every previous state file format, and the more state and features there are the harder this is to do. (Seriously, it was a pain in the butt to keep track of.) systemd is developed primarily by and for Red Hat who avoid this problem by not supporting upgrades to a new distro release from within the running system - but most other major distros do and will likely be bitten hard by the issue.<p>Without support for this you <i>can&#x27;t even reboot cleanly</i> after upgrading init or any of the libraries it uses, because init will keep old deleted executable open and make it impossible to remount root as read-only (an obscure quirk of Unix filesystems that basically only init developers need to know). You don&#x27;t just need to reboot to upgrade init, you need to boot into a special upgrade environment that doesn&#x27;t use the system&#x27;s init, and Fedora does. That&#x27;s why Fedora needs daemon-reexec - otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t even be able to apply security updates to glibc without rebooting first. Compare this with kernel upgrades, which can be installed immediately and simply don&#x27;t take effect until the next reboot.",1392040612

Women are not just under-represented in tech, but in the majority of the most lucrative professions as a whole. So, unless we accept the bogus argument that women are just naturally worse at stuff other than babies, we must assume that this is a problem with society as a whole (the dolls-versus-lego thing is a part of that, but not the only one).<p>Women-only classes and so on may or may not help the particular women involved into the industry - I don&#x27;t know. Presumably that can be empirically studied by people with the time and resources to do so. But the underlying problem is a matter for &#x27;concerned citizens&#x27;, not the tech industry <i>as the tech industry</i>.<p>Crusading, say, for &#x27;codes of conduct&#x27; at conferences has the seductive appeal of a modest and realisable goal; unfortunately, there is no nice, pat answer to gender inequality in society, as the last three centuries of &#x27;concerned citizens&#x27; have learned.

It&#x27;s not a standard, it has portability issues and it will probably never be implemented by anybody else other than Google. We can bitch and moan about how broken the W3C standardization process is, but the existence of this process is also why the web is open and why it&#x27;s awesome.<p>The alternative asm.js, while not being an answer to all issues addressed by NaCL, is a much better approach, because it&#x27;s still standard JS and even if the browser does not optimize for the asm.js instructions set, the app still works - and if it takes off for games (and I believe it will), then all browser vendors will be forced to optimize for it - because it&#x27;s one thing to not support some plugin (e.g. NaCL) and quite another to have clear instances in which the browser is much slower than the competition and thus directly comparable.<p>For unbelievers that haven&#x27;t seen asm.js in action, checkout this famous demo that works well in both Firefox and Chrome: <a href=""http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unrealengine.com/html5/</a> - that&#x27;s pure JS right there and I don&#x27;t think the limits have been reached.",1392039723

To me, having witnessed my wife toiling in labor for hours, it seems ridiculous to send a woman right back to work after having given birth to her child. Of course she should have the privilege to spend time with her children - she sacrificed the most to have them in the first place. What makes me angry is if this privilege is then turned on it&#x27;s head and the people who toil to make it possible (ie men earning the money to support the family) are then being blamed for it.<p>Again - everybody may choose their own preferences. I am just saying that the preferences we see today may not be completely arbitrary. Most people end up having children after all - nothing against the ones who don&#x27;t want to have children, but they simply don&#x27;t make a significant impact in the long run. They die, and then that&#x27;s it.",1392039495

7210916,comment,7207495,7209047,1,0,dalke,,,"> My second son is taking AP calculus BC as high school junior (eleventh grader).<p>Your example has a 15 year old going to community college or university in order to go to a calculus course. You named it the &quot;calculus trap&quot;, which includes as a negative the social problem of having a 15 year old in a class full of 19 year olds. This implies that it&#x27;s unlikely that the high school offers calculus.<p>My observation is that more and more high schools offer calculus in the high school, so the 15 year old you described, who was taking college courses to learn calculus, is now more likely to be a 15 year old at high school taking courses with 16 year olds (like your second son).<p>In that case, the severity of the trap is lessened, no? If only because the age gap is so much less.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you are wrong about how math knowledge should be developed. I point out only that the arguments from your hypothetical case feel a bit out of date.<p>Than again, suppose the 15 year old does take calculus at high school, then takes a tertiary education class at age 16. What class might that be? That&#x27;s about the time the standard college curriculum branches away from calculus, to include algebra, differential equations, or discrete math.<p>In that case, it&#x27;s not really a &quot;calculus&quot; trap, no? :)<p>Also, I read the reviews of KTEM. Cross-cultural observational comparisons are often enticing, but it&#x27;s hard to draw firm conclusions from them. Had you read, say, a comparison with the Finnish model then perhaps you might have drawn different conclusions?<p>My hypothesis, btw, is that the US is entirely too car dependent. Extracurricular activities like a city math club would be much easier if teens had ready access to transportation independent of their parents.",1392039447

I believe that we are going to start using that type of system more and more and eventually we will lose things like the HTTP layer.  This may be combined with some of the technologies related to cryptocurrency.<p>For an example of why we are moving to named data networking, take a look at well.. just about any web application that wants to scale.  For example the npm registry.  Also consider the issues around privacy with Facebook and the NSA, and the ability for governments to censor or take down web sites or domains.<p>So any technologies that facilitate things like that, such as more traditional clustered SQL or NoSQL tools, or especially protocols and systems specifically designed for named data networking, will be very powerful.  I like the idea of heterogeneous peer nodes that have everything they need built in and can connect to the network on their own.<p>Another area that is really going to be key is artificial general intelligence.  Notice I did not say machine learning.  I think look at taking advantage of built deep learning systems like the one IBM has with Watson.  Or look for deep learning, autoencoders, hierarchical hidden markov models, hierarchical temporal memory.  But most practically for the next few years IBM and Google&#x27;s (when Google releases it) cloud AIs are going to be game changing for many industries and harnessing them in software will be very useful.<p>Qualcomm/Brain Corporation and some others also have some neuromorphic chip technologies that could be extremely useful.<p>Any system that really takes advantage of next gen VR devices like Oculus Rift is going to be interesting.",1392039408

The belief in technology as unfathomable magics extends even into other scientific fields among people who are very intelligent (at least in my experience).

Of course either profiling or thorough knowledge of the code should be applied before making this decision to determine whether this code path is hot or not, what&#x27;s the average size of the array and so on. The main motivation for this decision would be the fact that slice produces the copy of the array. This is both hindrance in terms of performance (as VMs right now would not elide copy operation) and in terms of readability (e.g. when I see such code I would have to ask myself: does doOtherFunction require fresh copy or not, does it use only the first argument or all of what forEach passes into it and so on?).<p>So you can see the choice for me is pretty complicated.",1392038135

I learned Pascal, C, C++, Lisp, Scheme and Smalltalk. My favorite language was Lisp. I was hired as a programmer for my first job but within 6 months I became a product manager. I never had to write code again for my job.<p>Fast-forward almost 20 years later, I decided I wanted to build my own mobile app and experience with the whole App Store economy. To do that, I learned Javascript, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 to build a phonegap app.<p>I studied with http://www.w3schools.com until I felt confident enough to go ahead and build my very first mobile app. My training took a full-time month for these 3 languages.<p>I used the http://www.telerik.com platform as my coding environment. That saved me hours.<p>It was actually much easier than I thought. Coding is like cycling, you never really forget it as long as you were taught algorithmic properly (which I was).<p>I would have never succeeded without the fantastic StackOverflow community though - it seemed like every time I was hitting a dead end, someone had been through the same problem and the answer was always here for me to find.<p>My only struggle was to not know that SQL calls from Javascript were asynchronous.

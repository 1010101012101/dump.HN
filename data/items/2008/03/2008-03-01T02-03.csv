Mine was just a hobby site, and running the server was part of the fun. For anything more than that you are better off with professional hosting.",1204339418

I have no recollection of ever creating or logging in to an Orkut account. I <i>presume</i> that no-one has got hold of my Google Account password and used it to maliciously register me to Orkut. And no, I wasn't drunk over Christmastime.",1204338713

126515,comment,126480,126498,0,0,irrelative,,,"Also, it's against the terms of service for basically all ISPs to let you run a server.  They'll probably only enforce it, though, when you start getting a lot of traffic -- this means that you'll be turned off right as you are starting to gain traction.  That's a bad time to have 404s.  Also, what happens if the power flickers?  Internet goes down?<p>Start with a VPS -- even if 30 bucks a month sounds like a big chunk of change, consider your other overhead (rent, groceries, etc).  Not a big price to pay for the benefits.<p>Good luck!",1204338296

Is it automatically deleted after a certain number of down-mods, do the HN admin gods remove it for whatever reason, or is it only removed when the poster manually deletes it after a comment has been made on it?<p><i>Replied to you since I can't reply to the deleted comment.</i>",1204337476
126509,comment,126421,126421,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I suggest not bringing her on as an employee or founder, but instead as just a consultant. She can come by and advise you with your code if you need it. You might even let her have a small piece of equity (non-controlling and certainly not more than any other founders).<p>Think of what will happen to your relationship if you have a fundamental disagreement with which direction your startup should go (and there will be a lot of course corrections along the way).<p>Worst case with a just-business co-founder: Your startup fails and you go your separate ways, sure that it's the other founder's fault that you didn't get the funding round.<p>Worst case with your girlfriend co-founder (or even simply employee): you disagree with her and piss her off somehow. She still works there so she goes behind your back and undoes what work you do, by sabotaging your efforts, and maybe even bringing other people in to your disagreement, and ultimately your relationship (not cheating, but forming factions against you within your startup). Now your startup ultimately fails as in case one, except in this case you've also lost your girlfriend.<p>Alternate worst case with your girlfriend co-founder: You have a fundamental disagreement with her, but because of the emotions involved in a relationship, she leaves the team entirely (and with no notice) taking her work with her (by acting maliciously or just simply leaving without letting other people know what she's done already, leaving them clueless as how to run what she was responsible for).<p>Either way, the downside is larger when your girlfriend is involved. Too many emotions involved in relationships to add to the stress of a startup. Don't do it.",1204337366

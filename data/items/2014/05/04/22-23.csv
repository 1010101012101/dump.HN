It&#x27;s you who has contempt for Hollywood, which seems to stem from a misguided belief that the Hollywood action flicks are meant to be realistic. They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re meant to entertain the audience. No one wants to watch some hacker hack into a database because the realistic representation of that would be boring and -- more importantly -- it isn&#x27;t actually important <i>how</i> any of that happens. They&#x27;re just events used to drive the plot forward. Obviously this isn&#x27;t true for all movies, but thinking Hollywood gets the details wrong because they hate you reeks of self-importance.",1399244332

For example, if that were true, then there would be a correlation between beautiful codebases and codebases which make money.  In my experience there is no such correlation.<p>Businesses generally maintain their codebases by hiring people to work on it rather than adopting good practices from the start (so that they don&#x27;t have to hire more people to work on it).  That&#x27;s why startups have another advantage: they can work much faster than big companies, because big companies generally have to deal with ten metaphorical tons of code bloat, which slows them down almost as much as their bureaucratic nature.",1399243932

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really the goal, though. We are interested in drawing inferences about the artists and their work. As I say above, the rankings are correct modulo noise (there is noise, unless we wouldn&#x27;t find it meaningful that these numbers could be different for different 35,000 word samples for the same artist and it is impossible that they could be different for the first 35,000 words due to causes unrelated to those that we are trying to measure), but the magnitudes of the differences could be pretty far off.",1399243929

I have purchased 2 of these (my first Chromebooks), initially to replace WinXP laptops used by family members mostly for web-related purposes.  They are (for us, within their limits) truly utilitarian and appliance-like in ways that a standard laptop has not been.<p>Anyway, my suspicion is that this (ongoing, very well-received refurb sale) is an echo: that large quantities of these were sold during the previous Xmas holiday period, with a significant percentage of gift-givers/-recipients being unaware of the core nature of the item (instead concluding from appearance that it is &quot;a laptop PC&quot; (with a low price)), and, when confronted with reality, deciding to return it.",1399241415
7696031,comment,7694795,7695578,8,0,npalli,,,"The situation in Japan developed because the real estate got disconnected from its economic potential by a large margin. At the peak of the bubble in the mid-80’s the land value of just the imperial palace in Tokyo was worth more than the entire land value of California.  A million times ratio!!. There is no amount of urbanization that could have solved this problem for you because the underlying economics did not make sense. In the end, I’m not sure the Japanese had a choice, maybe they could have let some banks fail earlier but the size of the bubble was so massive that immediate deflation would have triggered a Lehmann like moment for them.<p>In fact, if Option 2 is correct I’m pretty sure the Chinese leadership has no other option but to deflate the economic gap with a zombie like situation for decades. If you think they will let a Lehmann-like moment to happen and quickly reset prices back to the ‘right’ level you are mistaken. It would put the financial system at risk; the entire legitimacy of the CCP in danger and that would mean blood on the streets. They will keep shutting down the smaller non-state banks and keep rolling the loans of the bigger state banks and gradually write off the debt over several years. There is definitely no shock therapy of short-term pain that makes sense.",1399241414

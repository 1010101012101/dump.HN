I understand the benefit of not having to make every single decision from the ground up when you're getting started on a project, but sometimes I worry that working with rails is actually warping my thought patterns to fit its myopic vision of how web apps ""should"" work.<p>To phrase it differently: I feel comfortable with a framework or community forcing me to change <i>how</i> I achieve some higher-level goal.

2653532,comment,2649226,2651081,2,0,mikegreenberg,,,"{tl;dr} Improve your on-boarding experience (interactive tutorial game) and improve your help tools (in-game community support/commentary, discussion area, etc). Study what companies like Zynga are doing in the online game space and figure out how one of any of their more complicated games get so addicting. {/tl;dr}<p>I started looking at the Developer Channel videos about the sim and I gotta say you weren't lying about the steep learning curve! <i>sigh</i> If I were in your shoes, I'd be out looking for money to secure a badass UX designer. A site like this REALLY needs an experience that immerses the player into the game and GRADUALLY shows them the ropes. This sort of thing is very difficult to get right because there are so many moving parts. The ""progressive reveal"" is a great tool a designer will use to help the user jump on easily without getting ""fatigued"".<p>I really think this is the sort of product which could do well with the very hardcore sports fans, but you'd have to create some support to get them over that initial hurdle. An ideal solution would be a tutorial game which walks the user through the features and common strategies.<p>I'd try to develop a community around it and let users collaborate on their experiences and strategies. Promote improving your game with things like contests or tasks (max number of completions in a game, lowest salaried super bowl winning team, etc) and generate content that gets players thinking about how to win these challenges. If you have the budget, attempt to do some real-world tie-ins. Ex: Winner of this season's superbowl gets tickets to the real deal.<p>The driving factor of each promotion should ultimately get players ""better"" at the game. And providing tools to help each other improve the on-boarding experience (and bring their friends) will help your user base grow more easily. As much as I loathe Facebook platform games, many of the games that Zynga publishes there are very complicated and require some user training to get them up to speed. I'd study those games VERY CAREFULLY. Look for patterns and how they provide incentive to continue playing.",1308067076

The points about misogyny resonated with me, but everything he criticized about the gameplay resonated as well.<p>Linear gameplay with cutscenes, bleah.  Regenerating health, meh, not in this kind of game.  You can only carry two guns and they aren't fun to shoot -- what are they THINKING?  This is DUKE.  I don't know what era they grew up in, but my action heroes can carry at least six guns, maybe eight, and at least half a ton of ammo.<p>Nothing as fresh and silly as the shrink gun was?  It was little novelties like that made Duke fun to play.  If you want to make penis jokes, make a penis gun.  If you want to make a joke about homophobia, make a leather gun that decks a bad guy out in a leather outfit with assless chaps, temporarily incapacitating his friends as they laugh at him.  Blammo -- joke's on them!  It wouldn't have any point against the big bosses since they work alone, but it would be fun to use anyway -- what is this big blob of alien going to look like in leather?  It would also add some sexual interest without being too misogynistic, since you could shoot women to give them a bad-ass leather and sunglasses look, which would give them a lot more class and dignity and real sex appeal than they usually have in Duke games.  Maybe they'd grab a gun and fight on your side for a while.<p>How did I just think up a major improvement to the game while writing an HN comment, and they couldn't do it in... how many years?",1308066917

The quants didn't ask for the system to be the way it is.<p>If anything, they, by exploiting this flaw, act to expose it, making it more visible and more likely to be fixed. Imagine if more grad students did this. You'd drive the stock market to collapse so many times -- at least in theory, 'cuz you're basically <i>draining</i> it like a pool, and it's a finite pool -- the government would be -forced- to give up on its newfound policy of Too Big to Fail.<p>Conversely, the fact that students continue to enter grad school despite the skyrocketing financial inadvisability therein, this only serves to swell what is apparently a labor excess even further. If universities had to compete for grad students on price, stipends would increase! Those who enter grad school out of some sense of altruism actually do their fellow students a disservice.<p>...so, having read that, what the fuck am I doing, you ask? Well, I'm just avoiding people I can't stand to be around. I like professors; I hate managers. My perceived-value-of-research is skewed. As an added bonus academics posess a level of freedom on par with the super-rich; if some University wants you to immigrate to a country in order to do research, you're waived right in. A PhD carries the sort of international mobility that's I think is kind of useful having been born in a sinking ship. In America it's called the O-1, but most countries have an analog.

I think the traditional CS curriculum, at least at my university, induces learned helplessness, so that by the time students get to a 300-level course they're so convinced they can't do a project they don't even try.<p>I taught an intro to comp sci summer course that was evenly split between over-achievers looking to get the intro course done before starting their freshman year, and demoralized post-freshmen who had failed the course during the regular year.<p>By the end of the 9 week summer session, they all had a working Minesweeper game written in Java. I set out levels of achievement they could attain, from very basic working mechanics (including a timer) up to marking a space questionable and revealing all blank spaces surrounding a blank. I demonstrated how to do that using recursion, which our curriculum doesn't even allow teaching until 3rd year, but which my students didn't seem to have any trouble with. I believe recursion is actually a very natural way of thinking, but we prime students to fail at it because all they hear before learning it is that ""it's so hard.""<p>I see our curriculum, at least, as one of the biggest hindrances to learning CS.

In some cases, it's impossible to determine the proper tax rate without a nine-digit zip since city boundaries may split zip codes, meaning city+county or just county might apply in different parts of a zip code area.  Forcing the customer to enter a nine-digit zip and then possibly choose between multiple tax options when it's still not clear leads to an incredibly high friction checkout.  The main winners in this fight are the companies that provide sales tax computation components or APIs for web services.<p>However, I think having a sales tax based on location of seller rather than buyer doesn't make as much sense.  The big companies like Amazon would find loopholes that allowed them to originate from low/no tax areas and smaller sites without the ability to relocate would be stuck with most of the burden.

This isn't about it being all or nothing, or even the government obtaining satisfaction in its efforts. The point is that they have very powerful tools to move the ""demand"" part of the supply/demand curve determining BitCoin's value in dollars (and by extension, the greater Global Economy that dollars are a part of; it is basically impossible for BitCoins to have vastly greater value in Euros than Dollars because that's just an arbitrage opportunity that will be immediately exploited and thereby removed). By powerfully dropping demand, the value of BitCoins will rapidly drop. The fact that they are rapidly dropping tends to self-reinforce. In minutes or hours, your ""$500,000"" of BitCoin could be worth ten cents. Are you going to be motivated to stick around after that? The True Believers will, but most average folk and most intelligent financial folk won't.<p>The end result may be an economy that the US government can't shrink past a few tens of thousands of dollars any more than it can eliminate drugs. But even if BitCoin is not ""killable"", it certain <i>can</i> fail to meet the goals set out for it, and it is pretty much within the power of the US government, and for that matter several others, to make that happen. You don't have to destroy it utterly to make it useless. In fact I'm rather concerned that BitCoin can't even survive a <i>non-</i>government caused shock once it is being used by more than just True Believers.<p>(Also, note that the immediately obvious parallel of the drug war doesn't apply; government attacked the supply of the drugs but has much less power to affect demand. Attacking supply causes prices to rise, but then the increased prices drove increasingly well funded smuggling efforts. If the government could actually remove the demand for drugs in some magical manner, the War on Drugs would be over in a matter of weeks.)",1308066025

However, they might not like you using that much data.  American carriers generally restrict which devices you can activate on which plans in order to guestimate average data usage for that device.  For example, Sprint charges an extra $10/mo for unlimited smartphone data over the unlimited data for other devices.  So, StraightTalk might decide to disconnect your device if you use ""too much"" data and aren't using one of their devices.  I'm not saying it's right to put restrictions on ""unlimited data"", just that they might decide not to serve you as a customer using a device they don't sell (and it might mean that you have a $650 iPhone that you can only use on AT&T).<p>It's also possible that StraightTalk doesn't rent 3G off AT&T.  So, it might still just be 2G.  For example, Sprint roams on Verizon, but doesn't roam on Verizon 3G, only 2G (except in former Alltel areas).<p>It should also be noted that over 24 months, the unlocked iPhone will cost you an additional $18.75/mo.  So, you'd have to find a discount carrier that was a lot cheaper, not just a little bit cheaper.  If you expect to upgrade your iPhone every year ($37.50) or 18 months ($25/mo), the unlocked's pricing starts looking worse.  So, make sure to think about that too.",1308065971

Even their best configs have pretty slow per-core performance. We could buy a bunch of physical servers and colocate them for a fraction of the price Amazon costs us per year, and enjoy a tenfold performance increase.<p>The second issue is the pricing structure, which does not allow for fine-grained resource allocation; the configurations Amazon offer are rarely ever ""just right"", and it's not possible to tweak them to save money when we can make do with something small and simple. Scaling horizontally to work around the resource granularity issue is not really an option as it would be too costly.<p>There are some other technical issues that are tiresome to deal with, such as Amazon's dependency on a weird NAT structure that require ugly workarounds in our management systems (eg., Puppet).<p>We have migrated a few hosts off Amazon over to Cloud Sigma, which we immediately perceived as having better CPU performance, and a _much_ nicer pricing structure where you essentially pay by by the gigahertz (CPU) and megabyte (RAM) in 5-minute intervals.

allinvain<p>First thing that I noticed is that my slush's pool account got hacked into and someone changed the payout address to this:<p>15iUDqk6nLmav3B1xUHPQivDpfMruVsu9f<p>I then changed the password and proceeded to run some antivirus and anti malware scans. Some stuff was found, but they were all cleaned up and they were all in my windows user profile temp dir which I deleted all the temp files. God I can't even type properly. Sorry folks I'm a bit emotional now.<p>I then left another virus scanner running and went to sleep. When I woke up I check my bitcoin wallet. I leave the client running to help the network, and I notice -25,000 (and a transaction fee) gone.<p>Fuck, I really should've moved the coins to a vmware linux session I have running. But the question is was it already too late? Could someone had my access to my wallet.dat for a long time and now just decided to ""cash out""",1308064985

2653289,comment,2649749,2652964,2,0,dkarl,,,"Back in the day, it was very common among Java programmers to consider using ?: as atrocious style.  It was a relic from C, eccentric and therefore confusing, just more damage inflicted on the language through the influence of conservative programmers who didn't ""get"" Java.  Since most Java programmers were monolingual and learned from books that relegated ?: to a few sentences inserted somewhere for completeness, many didn't even recognize it as an operator.<p>Even setting aside my love for the ?: operator, I never understood that attitude.  One of the major selling points of Java in the early days was that it was simple enough for everyone to understand pretty completely.  It was supposed to be impossible for a guru to write code that a junior programmer couldn't understand at the small scale with some effort, line-by-line, if not at the large scale.  Training programmers to be competent at only a subset of the language undermined the purpose of having such a simple language.",1308064038

You could completely hand over your wallet to someone else, but that sort of defies the point of Bitcoin:  they could log transactions, be raided by authorities, etc.  You could store your wallet in a way that's physically secure (say, on a flash drive), but this just requires the hacker to insert software that waits until you try to spend some of that bitcoin.  You could maintain many separate wallets on separate flash drives, so you would only lose part of your savings to this sort of attack, but that is inconvenient.<p>The only solution I'm coming up with would be to hand over control of your wallet to an anonymous-yet-trusted third party who's hidden behind Tor or such.

Merchants are already using MtGox API and ticker so they set a price in dollars, and the displayed price in bitcoins is updated as the BTC/USD exchange goes up or down in MtGox, automatically.<p>Extending your argument, the Government could try to mess up buying up a lot of bitcoins, to force deflation, then selling them all to force inflation, and so on.  Good luck with that, because that would be very expensive in dollars (buying high and selling low).  And if the Federal Reserve did this with out-of-thin-air dollars, it would just weaken the dollar in the long term, what would be good for Bitcoin.<p>Some people say the Fed has being trying this price suppression with gold.

However the essence of the issue appears to come down to a mix of the economics of being a HGV driver, local politics, and the nature of congestion and traffic in an old city.<p>The economics is that HGV drivers are paid by the job. They are effectively incentivised to complete a job as fast as possible to increase their earnings. Being paid to go faster isn&#x27;t very compatible with driving safer.<p>The politics is a blend of TfL (Transport for London) not having the authority to re-design many junctions, local councils wishing to maximise traffic flow, and residents not wishing to tolerate construction traffic outside of work hours. This means that construction traffic can only operate during the work day (when it&#x27;s most congested), on roads that were not designed for such a volume of HGV traffic, with junctions not designed for cyclist safety or space. A very recent HGV fatality is directly contributable to Westminster Council refusing to implement recommendations by TfL to make a junction next to a bridge safer... this was last week, you&#x27;ll find the info online easily enough.<p>The last point relates to the city itself. You&#x27;ll see from other comments that the best thing to do is to segregate cyclists from the motorised traffic, but that requires space. London is an old city and we cannot move buildings and streets to accommodate this segregation outside of more than a handful of wide boulevards and roads (such as the Embankment where it is being done). We can only achieve segregation by turning 2-way streets into 1-way streets (as is being done on Tottenham Court Road), but even then that adds pressure to surrounding roads. There are limits to what can be done to provide extra space and re-designs to existing junctions and roads.<p>Possibly the best thing is the cross-London move to a 20mph speed limit.<p>But the biggest remaining thing that could be done might be to change the economics of the construction industry in London. Perhaps just place an outright ban on HGVs that do not meet some strict requirement for operating in such a busy metropolis. Perhaps just change the status of road fatalities by HGVs such that they are considered a Health and Safety issue of the work-site that the work is being done for... i.e. if the victim&#x27;s family can sue the construction site for death then perhaps that will change the job incentives enough to bring in safety features, etc.<p>But yeah, we are on it.",1429174488

Pedestrians can be very unpredictable and they don&#x27;t tend to signal very clearly what they are about to do, not to mention that a pedestrian can stop or turn around pretty much instantly.<p>The optimal solution is of course to build dedicated bike lanes, but if that&#x27;s not a option I&#x27;d rather ride my bike on the road with other cars, than on a shared path with pedestrians. It&#x27;s also a matter of attitude, roads are built to allow cars to travel between point A and point B as fast as possible. If cycling is to be seen as a form of transportation they also need to have access to proper infrastructure.",1429173542

The parent (and I) disagree with that; no one&#x27;s suggesting those people want to get hit or are inattentive, just that they&#x27;re not abiding by traffic laws.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat telling that most bicycle fatalities don&#x27;t involve a cyclist doing something stupid: most cyclist law-breaking is done when the cyclist believes it&#x27;s safe to do so, and they&#x27;re usually very attentive and aware of their surroundings for the duration.  It&#x27;s when the cyclist is in a normal state, and has no reason to expect a surprise attack-by-car, that the fatalities happen.<p>(As a pedestrian, I very much sympathize with this.  I tend to jaywalk quite often when walking, and when I do, I&#x27;m super attentive and ensure it&#x27;s safe before crossing.  It&#x27;s probably more likely that I&#x27;d get hit by a car when I have the right of way than when jaywalking.

Overall, I’m not unhappy about the idea, though.<p>> Overall, I don&#x27;t see how bikes could have the exact same rights and obligations as cars, although overall both are vehicles and should be treated as vehicles, equally. Still, you can&#x27;t ride a bike on an Autobahn, and neither can you drive a tractor. You may or may not be allowed to ride bike on a road that is dedicated to buses, although you may be allowed to ride a bike there. Etc, etc. Bikes cannot and shouldn&#x27;t have *exact&#x27; same rights and obligations as cars.<p>Of course there was some hyperbole there – I don’t expect to be allowed to drive on a highway, but not because I am a cyclist but because I can’t meet some minimum speed (i.e. the same rules that mean tractors can’t drive there either). However, I don’t see why I can’t drive on an inner-city road among cars which are at most allowed to drive 50 km/h and instead have to stick to a tiny bike lane next to a series of parked cars.<p>Regarding bus lanes, I am actually not too fond of them being open to cyclists: A single bus being slowed down annoys substantially more people than even a couple cars being slowed down and passing by a stopped bus is a major annoyance and safety issue. There’s some idea that you can promote cycling by giving out these perks (elsewhere, hybrids or electric cars are allowed to use them, too), but overall that shouldn’t be necessary in a healthy climate.",1429173171

A majority do not stop at stop signs.  When it comes to stopping, cars are <i>much</i> more law-abiding (likely because the penalty is worse, not because of any desire to be safer).  Many cyclists make unsafe turns; I&#x27;ve had a few close calls while walking.  Many ride on the sidewalk.  I even occasionally see a cyclist riding the wrong way on a one-way street (though most will move to the sidewalk instead of doing this, which is just as bad).<p><i>And if you want further proof, just read the list of bicycle fatalities in SF and see who is at fault.

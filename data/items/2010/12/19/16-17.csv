No different than what I see on endless blogs on the net. If he hadn't ""begged"" for a tip, chances are he wouldn't have gotten any.<p>What gets me puzzled here though, is it seems that it's OK for a company to charge for something (that may even be valueless to many, many people) and it's expected, but if an individual person suggests tipping on their ""product"" everyone gets their panties in a bunch.

I decided to build a mechanism for copy protection which can be remotely enabled.<p>The app made it to the top 20 in its category, so pirates didn't take more than a couple of hours to post cracked binaries. I've been checking the server logs and the legit users to pirates ratio is around 20%. I've downloaded the cracked binaries and the copy protection is still there. Basically, the app runs some critical operations using a custom bytecode through an interpreter, which means it's not easy to crack.

2021913,comment,2020631,2020631,0,0,kevinelliott,,,"After reading the full story I read all the comments here on HN. I didn't see mentioned several thoughts I had while reading the story, so I thought I'd share them here.<p>1) Transparency. I thought it was really interesting how candid and transparent the author was with his story. And this was in 1995. In many ways this was an experiment of its time, as he was willing to let all parties involved know about what he was thinking and what others were thinking as well (by republishing the public's opinion letters). You don't see this much of a ""black box"" in people's activities these days, even with all the social networking status updates. People simply leave out a lot of detail in fear of what others will think, or how it might affect them in some way (personally, professionally, etc...)<p>2) Big corporations often forget how to relate to their customers. This story exemplifies how nasty and out of touch big corporations often are, even when a loyal customer (10 years is a long time for anything) attempts to negotiate a reasonable outcome. Big companies simply ""feel"" bigger and stronger than individuals; and they generally are. Millions of people feel insignificant when they're treated so systematically unappreciated. These problems are likely worse today.<p>3) Insider details revealed. It is interesting to note that he revealed a lot of details that only someone in his position (or work for a bank, news agency, or television studio) would know. That really makes the story interesting because you feel like you're learning about how things work behind the scenes. In particular, it was interesting to follow the route of the check and hear about the clearinghouse bank, as well as how quickly the check landed in the hands of the Fed. Additionally, it was really valuable to see how the media works, specifically for how stories have to be pitched/approved/edited all across a large organization such as the WSJ before it's printed. Also notable was how the radio seemed to take a back seat to television, and would only really come in after national press already covered the story. You walk away from this story thinking you have a better idea of how these systems work.<p>4) Social engineering / social influence. His approach to getting information, or changing a person's attitude is evident in his anecdotes. He was social engineering in several instances, whether he realized it in those terms or not. It was interesting how he was able to change a person's negative attitude by simply sticking to his guns, but then phrasing things in a way that comforted the other person.

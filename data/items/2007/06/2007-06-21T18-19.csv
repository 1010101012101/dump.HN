I was somewhat hesitant to put this up on the news, but since it is our startup and I've been following YC for a while now, I thought some folks might like to see it.  <p>Really happy to hear that you were pulled in even though you're not a storm-o-phile.  <p>We definitely seem to teeter somewhere between 'great interface' and 'whoa, I'm overwhelmed, there's too much data!'  Density is what we are striving for, but legibility is paramount.",1182452047

It's pretty impressive.<p>In fact when I heard about the Google acquisition one of the first thing's I thought was: <i>That make sense inasmuch as it just continues the trend of Google's apps being the goto place for learning interesting javascript hacks</i>",1182451747

29869,comment,29861,29862,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually don't read any of the above unless linked from another source - too much noise, not enough signal.<p>I read Programming Reddit, News.YC, and occasionally Startupping and LambdaTheUltimate.  I try to keep up with some blogs of startup-type people - Dharmesh Shah, Joe Kraus, Raganwald, Paul Buchheit, Mark Fletcher, and Marc Andreesen and Wil Schroter look interesting based on their recently-linked news.YC articles.<p>Also, don't underestimate the importance of good old fashioned dead-tree books.  I know it's fashionable to spend all day online now, but I still find I get lots more information out of published works than the Internet (the net is great for <i>pointers</i> to books, though).  I read a lot of history, economics, corporate histories, some biographies, theoretical computer science, etc.  Some selected titles off my reading history (my library's software keeps track of books I've checked out):<p>""Founders at Work"" (Jessica Livingston), ""The Rockefeller Billions"" (Jules Abels), ""Stocks for the Long Run"" (Jeremy Siegel), ""The Intelligent Investor"" (Benjamin Graham), ""When Genius Failed"" (Roger Lowenstein), ""One Up on Wall Street"" (Peter Lynch), ""Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes"" (Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich), ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money"" (John Maynard Keynes), ""The Google Story"" (David A.

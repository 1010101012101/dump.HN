I state that every sufficiently complicated Lisp program contains an ad-hoc, half-broken version of sky-lang. I don't want that. I want the real thing.<p>Every language is ""programmable"", that's what the Greenspun rule says. Just because Lisp does it better than the others doesn't mean that it's actually close to what can be done.",1215521257

239773,story,,,2,4,Tichy,"Ask HN: ""stock market"" mechanism for stuff?",,"I've just been wondering if trading used stuff in a way similar to the stock market could work.<p>What I mean is: sellers enter the lowest bid they would accept, buyers enter the highest bid they would be prepared to pay, resolve by some algorithm (I don't even know exactly how the resolution algorithm for the ""real"" stock market works).<p>The problem to be solved: buyers can instantly buy the things they want, or at least more instantly than they could on ebay. Sellers could still be more or less sure to get the appropriate market price.<p>Problem with implementation: other than stock, things are not always identical (wear and tear). Probably it would only work for things that are traded a lot (iPods, and stuff ...). Maybe the wear and tear thing could be resolved by providing set categories (new, almost new, worn...), and users could enter numbers for each category, or enter default penalties in their profile (if used offer = 75%*offer). It wouldn't be a precise match, but maybe the convenience would offset the losses incurred by the inexact matching.<p>What do you think?<p>I have been looking to buy a Wii on ebay for quite a while now, hoping to save about 40â‚¬ compared to buying it in the shop. Of course it is totally not worth the effort - sorting through the auctions is time consuming, and then you still can't be sure that you will actually win the auction (usually I don't). Ebay's system forces you to pay attention until the last minute of the auctions. Interesting auctions might not finish for a couple of days - so I wait, and in the end it amounts to nothing.",1215518400

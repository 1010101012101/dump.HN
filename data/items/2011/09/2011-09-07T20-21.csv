No government support, no health care, no education, no nothing.</i><p>That isn't Hayek either, though. Some Hayekians, yes, but Hayek himself was in favor of safety nets, and even argued positively for them in a number of places. He grouped basic healthcare along with fire protection and a police service as the minimal services a state should provide, and also supported a subsistence-level guaranteed minimum income (as a direct transfer payment, rather than as some complex combination of food stamps, rent control, housing subsidy, unemployment insurance, etc., etc.). One of his arguments was that a background safety net promotes individual freedom by lessening tribalist instincts--- if there's no safety net, people will cling to things like their church or ethnic group for a safety net, out of fear of being left out in the cold.",1315429139

That's living under a bridge and wearing trash bags to work.""<p>Exactly.<p>""I don't really understand why that's the case, either."" I'm not sure I understand the question.  If you mean, ""Why do these other countries cost less to live in?"" it is the case that some things cost the same in both 1st world and developing countries.  Some of it goes back to Brenton Woods, and some of it goes back further.  It's a really good question, but it seems that the more 'developed' a country the higher the wages, AND the higher the cost of living, which in a lot of areas leads to equillbirum, but certainly not in every area.<p>One example would be the family car, which might cost 20K new in the US, and about the same in Vietnam, so only very rich people in Vietnam can afford a new car.  One of the reasons the U.S. got out ahead on this industry is because a lot of the inventors in the field were, and have been American, and because of trade deals, and tariffs that used to protect the industry.<p>It's still the case that people want their cars to come more highly trained workers than say their shoes (not life or death if they're junk).  And those workers end up costing more to train and keep, thus the high price on this kind of good.",1315428984

With Riak, it will start issuing the writes to another node in the cluster and rebalance when the missing node comes back online.<p>* If I'm running MongoDB in a sharded configuration, if one of the shards cannot be reached, all writes will stop. With Riak, any node will accept the writes and, once the network issues are resolved, move them to the appropriate node.<p>That said, conflict resolution is hard and there's no real way to get around it when you're using a distributed database like Riak. With Riak, as Chad says you get ""increased development complexity for massively decreased deployment complexity.""

The author needs to define the word thrive.) I just want to say that I find it interesting that there is so much hand-wringing in these comments about jobs being displaced by technology.<p>In economics, we like to call this creative destruction. Old jobs go away and new jobs take their place. This is a natural process, and their is nothing so magically different about the technological revolution that it will somehow ""make jobs obsolete"".<p>Just as The Luddites protested against the loss of jobs brought on by the technological progress of the Industrial Revolution, now some individuals protest against the loss of jobs brought on by the technological progress of the ""Technological Revolution"". Then, as now, it was all hand-wringing and nail-biting with no serious economic analysis.<p>The critics say this time is different, this time there will be no new jobs, and we should urge people to find something other to do than working. The critics are wrong. Don't worry people. Employment is here to stay.<p>Side Note: The author engages in some navel gazing when he says America has all that it needs. I'm not sure if the author has noticed it or not, but there is a such thing as globalization and the global needs for goods and services will increase as developing countries close the ground with developed nations.<p>This global recession is just another business cycle, eventually the world will have another upswing, and then we will revert to mean again. There is no magic here, just the march of time. I would not put too much stock into those who believe that a single recession merits the reevaluation of the entire modern economic system.<p><i>Edit: Trying to trim the size. Eventually, I will learn the art of not making posts into walls of text.</i>",1315428670

So I'm going to follow-up.<p>I think we all take these models too far -- including fans of Hayek. I wasn't saying that everybody should subscribe to some school of thought. All I was saying is that when politicians use the terms ""jobs"" and ""education"", they mean certain things. For ""job"" they mostly a 9-5 job paying taxes, perhaps with some kind of benefit package, usually with some larger-corporation. When they say ""education"" they mean some sort of accredited institution that produces degreed folks. Not always, but a lot of the time. We've created these complex, well-funded, intricate, and powerful systems around the ""normal"" usage of these concepts. With lots of vested interests. Not bad people, or any of that. Just big systems to understand what these words mean and control how we relate to them.<p>The problem is that a huge swath of people are finding places to create value that don't involve working 9-5 at the mill any more. And an even greater number of folks are getting educated in ways that didn't even exist ten years ago.<p>Yes, if you a want a social welfare net by all means advocate for one. All I'm saying is that when some guy gets on TV and says we need to spend more money on education in order to produce jobs for the 21st century? Those terms are so far out of whack with what's actually happening as to make the solution worse than the initial problem. Unless your mental model has some small degree of fidelity with reality, your conversations and solutions will never work.<p>So I think it's entirely possible to separate creating a model of how things actually work -- which may have parts from Hayek or anybody else -- and applying that model to political discussions to get what we'd all like in a society. I had no intention of taking the discussion towards Hayek and letting the sick and poor die in the streets. I'm just pleading with authors like this to at least pick up some ideas from some other folks and take a look to see if the models -- words and relationships -- you are using actually reflect what's happening. Model creation is different from model application. It has to be.",1315428356

Problem is, those who produce will not be appreciated, but reviled, and their incentive to produce taken away.

Take away the profit motive by confiscating incomes to supply the idle, and few of the idle will use the opportunity for lofty endeavors; nay, most will cultivate dissatisfaction and demand more be confiscated for their gain.<p>As an ancient writer opined, ""if any would not work, neither should he eat.""",1315427938

As I say, there is no such thing as proof.  But there can be compelling evidence.<p>I think the most forceful thing to me is really the comprehensive case.  Almost across the board, I think the Christian worldview is significantly more intellectually satisfying than the atheist one.   Literally, better explanations.  The universe <i>looks</i> like God created it, and happily that's what I believe.  The atheist explanation has a lot of unverifiable stuff about  parallel universes and a lot of ""I don't know, I don't have to explain everything.""  The Bible <i>looks</i> like God wrote it, and happily that's what I believe.  I haven't read an atheist explanation for it yet that sounds like the author has actually read the basic history.  The Church <i>looks</i> like God runs it, and happily that's what I believe.  The atheist explanation makes it pretty clear they have no idea what church even is. My mystical experience <i>looks</i> like communication with God,  and happily that's what I believe.  The atheist explanation involves waffling and ghosts.  Or sometimes aliens.<p>If it was just one thing, I might say it was a fluke.  If those cases that I say <i>look</i> like God's work were vacuous explanations (in the sense that God can do anything), it would be dumb.

Intellectually, it's way better.<p>The only advantage to atheism is that you get to <i>look</i> like you're superior to everyone else.  If you're a Christian,  a lot of people think you're crazy, dumb, or both.  I honestly think atheism is sold on pride.  And maybe hatred for God, the church, and Christians, at least to judge from the rhetoric.  It sure as heck ain't the evidence.

Tell you what, let me expand a bit, so you can see what some of the arguments are.   These are the things I personally find persuasive.<p>The content and history of the Bible<p><pre><code>    - The Bible is completely unique among works of literature in its origin.  
      It was written over the course of 1500 years, by many different authors,
      in three languages, on three continents, in times of war, peace, 
      famine, plenty, persecution, and exile.  It was written by soldiers, 
      shepherds, statesmen, scholars, fishermen, kings, statesmen, 
      religious leaders, social outcasts, prisoners, and wealthy men.  It 
      was compiled independently by several separate communities centuries
      removed from the authors. 

      - It nonetheless tells a consistent, coherent story, and its message
        develops consistently throughout.  It is a serial, not an 
        anthology.  That strikes me as pretty darn amazing.  You try
        to construct a serial out of famous works across multiple millenia, 
        continents, cultures, and walks of life. 

      - No one author or organization has ever even remotely controlled it.
        The only one who could have written it is God. 

      - It is unique among works of scripture in being able to make 
        these claims.  Other scriptures are the work of one author,
        one culture, one time.  

      - In short, the Bible has credentials appropriate for supernatural
        origin.  If God *did* write a book, the Bible is a reasonable 
        candidate.


    - The Bible is an ancient book, the most modern parts being about as
      old as Aristotle.   If you go back and read stuff from the era,
      it sounds pretty foolish.  I mean, you can see some interesting
      early ideas, but we've learned a lot since then.  What they say
      seems silly and outdated.   *But we're still talking about the
      Bible.*  Whoever wrote it had such an insight into humanity that
      still find it relevant and insightful after two millenia.  
      Even with all the changes in culture and knowledge in between.  
      That seems like a feat worthy of God. 

    - The Bible contains well-known prophecies that can be validated
      by history.  Specific old testament prophecy about Jesus 
      preceded his appearance by several hundred years.  (Even
      if you assume the dead sea scrolls are the originals, they 
      still precede him by centuries).   The book of Daniel
      contains prophecies about later political events in Greece
      that are so accurate that some scholars resort to 
      assuming they are backfilled from the time of Greece (but
      this is inconsistent with any other dating for Daniel). 
      The formation of modern Israel as a state (in 1948) fulfills
      old testament prophecy.  The destruction of the temple in
      70 AD fulfills Jesus' prophecy.  

    - The message of the new testament, the Gospel, is remarkable
      in its effectiveness and adaptability to human circumstance.
      Literally the same message that is effective for a 
      herdsman in Africa is satisfying to a scholar at Oxford.  
      Criminals, saints, retarded people, healthy people, smart
      people, illiterate people, any people anywhere.  Writing
      such an egalitarian yet relevant plan of salvation is
      an amazing feat.  It is accessible to everyone, yet
      no one is overqualified.  It is comprehensible to 
      everyone, yet no one finds it trite or obvious. 

    - The Bible is remarkable in its historical accuracy, in 
      terms of the described geography, the times and founding
      of nations, the names of kings, etc.  In fact, the 
      historical elements are so accurate that they have been
      used as a guide to locate dig sites in archeology.  Yet
      it goes from secular history to miraculous accounts
      in one breath, the two being integrated in the stories
      and hard to separate.  It is hard to account for such
      a mixture of highly accurate history with fantasy. 

</code></pre>
The historical fact of Jesus' resurrection<p><pre><code>    - The resurrection of Jesus is claimed to have taken place
      well within the lifetimes of the gospel writers, yet 
      even hostile witnesses of the era write accounts
      consistent with its occurance.  This would have been an 
      immensely difficult message to propogate at the time, 
      akin to claiming now that John F. Kennedy had risen from
      the dead.  Moreover, the claimed support for the fact 
      does not take an authoriarian form, but references
      local witnesses.  (e.g., not ""Paul says so"", but 
      ""Ask around, lots of people saw him."" )

    - The founding of Christianity took place in the midst of
      powerful forces wishing to discredit it.  As the 
      resurrection of Jesus was the central fact on which it
      rested, it must not have been possible to disprove,
      either by the Jewish (religious) authority or by the
      Roman (state) authority.  The heavily persecuted
      church was in no position to perpetrate a fraud. 

    - The psychological activity of the early church is 
      consistent with people who believed Jesus had risen from
      the dead, and is completely at odds with their own 
      recorded behavior after his death.  They literally
      went from scattered and demoralized to boldly inviting
      death. 

    - The choice of Sunday as a day of worship is completely 
      unexpected for people of a Jewish background, and is
      evidence of a major theological event occuring on
      a Sunday. 

    - Eleven of the twelve apostles (founders of Christianity)
      were killed for their faith.  The twelfth served life 
      in prison.  All of them went to their graves still
      claiming the resurrection was a reality. 

</code></pre>
The experience of the modern church<p><pre><code>    - Christianity as a religion was explosive at its founding
      and is today practiced worldwide.  Only two other religions
      can make such a claim, both of which are closely related
      to Christianity.  Something happened  thousands of years 
      ago, and everyone is *still* talking about it and reacting 
      to it.   If God ever did act in history, that scale of
      result is appropriate. 

    - The modern church is filled with people who will say
      an encounter with Jesus changed their lives.  Not just
      spiritually; practically: reformed criminals, selfish
      people who have become generous, crazy people who
      have become sane, etc.  Whatever else you can say
      about the gospel, it clearly *works*.  This sort of
      impact is appropriate for God's central message.

    - The modern chuch still experiences miracles and divine
      intervention. (Controversial -- I reference my own
      experience here.) 

    - Many famous heroes of history reference Christianity as
      the source of their ideas.  For example, church organizations
      were central in the abolition of slavery.  

    - Many famous Christian apologists began as atheists who 
      became convinced of the truth of Christianity through
      (initially hostile) study.  G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis,
      Lee Strobel, to begin with.  In fact, I would say this
      is more the rule than the exception.  This flow of 
      immigration is appropriate for an intellectually sound
      message.

</code></pre>
The Origin of the Universe<p><pre><code>    - The more distantly one goes back in cosmic history,
      the more remarkable are the coincidences that that make
      human life possible.  If this universe wasn't designed
      for us, then there must be a HELL of a lot of other, 
      barren universes out there. 

    - ""First Law"" -- As natural laws are simply descriptions
      of regularities in nature, they cannot indefinitely
      explain themselves.  The moon orbits because of gravity,
      gravity is caused by something else, etc., but it cannot
      be turtles all the way down.  

    - The laws of the universe are awfully beautiful, certainly
      beyond anything we could write.  If the universe was
      designed, it certainly is the work of a superintelligence
      of God's calibur.</code></pre>",1315426488

I mean, weren't you the one earlier in this thread telling lotharbot his mystical experiences could be explained by ghosts?<p>You know who would interpret it as evidence for God's existence?  <i>People who already believe in him.</i>  Miracles are like that.  They are just another class of evidence; if the other classes aren't persuasive to you, they won't even rock your boat.<p>There is no such thing as proof in reality.  No such thing at all.  Philosophers will tell you that you can't prove your mother exists, and they're right.<p>Proof is too high a standard for real things.  In the real world, all we have is evidence.",1315426381

It doesn't simply encourage people to spend; it also encourages people to allow better-positioned entities to allocate capital, which is why new business ventures don't need to go door-to-door to fund new factories. Individuals are crappy at allocating capital, because they have small amounts of it and are too busy mastering Dentistry or Architecture to build expertise in risk management.<p>Unsustainable debt is an orthogonal issue. We've encouraged unsustainable debt not by allowing our currency to inflate, but by failing to regulate lenders and by offering them incentives to ignore risk management.<p>Again, though: this ""is a little inflation good, and is a little deflation bad?"" thing is a fake controversy that dignifies Bitcoin.

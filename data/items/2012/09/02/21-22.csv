4468286,comment,4468016,4468132,10,0,smartkids,,,"Yes, but perhaps _making things easy to use_ and _sexy hardware design_ might have something to do with their success?<p>The problem with the research labs at those example companies you cited is that those businesses have little incentive to introduce innovation that would compete with ""yesterday's ideas"" that are driving their profits.<p>This is why Bell Labs was so unique.  They could basically do whatever they wanted (you might try to make the same claim with your example companies, perhaps) _but_ ... they also managed to release these ideas into the market.  And not always to the satisfaction of AT&T.  People once had to pay for UNIX.  Not anymore.<p>Xerox PARC is another well-known case where people were ""set free"" to work on whatever they wanted.  But their ideas did not manage to trickle out to the market very well.  Instead, Microsoft got one of their key people, Excel was born and the rest is history.<p>Apple is _not_ an idea factory.  If someone called them two-timing thieves and told us to watch our backs, I would be inclined to take it seriously.  (The fact that Apple is not the idea factory is why the lawsuits are so offensive to anyone who knows anything about the history of computers.  If these sort of broad patents should go to anyone, it should be people like the ones who worked at Bell Labs and Xerox PARC.  But maybe patents were not their priority.  Maybe they were more interested in research, or playing computer games, than money.  [How many UNIX patents? 1?]  Go figure.)<p>But, Apple is a design house.  An within IT, they do not have lots of competition in that area: e.g. design of hardware casings.  In addition they go to great lengths to make the great ideas (namely the flexibility and stability of UNIX-like systems) easy to use.  Another area that is lacking in IT: making the good stuff (like UNIX) easy to use.<p>Unfortunately Apple feels the need to abuse the patent system to stay on top.  It makes me think if they didn't they might be in for a big fall.  Maybe they are surprised at their own success?  And nervous about losing the top spot?<p>Incidentally you could argue IBM started all this software patent nonsense.  Not sure many programmers would agree with you, but the number of filings and issued patents by IBM, most of them before Microsoft even had a patent department, tells the story quite clearly.<p>You are not going to see much innovation released from ""research labs"" at the likes of Microsoft or those other companies.  They will not keep their patent department in the dark.  Those guys want to keep their jobs, not take risks.  ""Microsoft Research"" or ""Google Labs"" are not Bell Labs or Xerox PARC.  It's a wonder that something like Kinect was even made into a product.  And you could see how nervous they were about it.<p>Today, the ""labs"" and the idea factory is the world wild web.<p>That's where the risks are taken.",1346622998

Once they get into the government databases, you can (a) never retract them (and nor can you change your fingerprints or DNA), and (b) you can fall victim to false matches.<p>Here's a similar case of a false match -- in this case for fingerprints:<p>Portland-area lawyer Brandon Mayfield was arrested in May 2004 because his fingerprint matched one found on a bag of detonators near the train station in Madrid in the March 11 2004 bombing, which killed 191 people. But Spanish authorities said the fingerprints belonged to another man, an Algerian. A US federal court later threw out the case against Mayfield, and the FBI expressed regret for the ""fingerprint-identification error"". As a former Army officer, Mayfield's fingerprints would be on file with the government. A law enforcement official said the fingerprints were not on file because of any crime or as part of the government's terrorism databases.",1346622773

4468224,comment,4467663,4467743,1,0,hatcravat,,,">So what exactly can I do with one of these?<p>The processor on this chip is an ARM cpu with floating point support, probably not something that most would consider exceptional.  But for a microcontroller like this, the most interesting aspect is the on-board peripherals.  Most MCUs will have some sort of analog to digital converters, counter/timer blocks, etc.  You can download the datasheet for the Stellaris chip in question from here: <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm4f120h5qr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm4f120h5qr</a><p>Some of the highlights:\n<i>12 counter/timer blocks.  They each have a capture/compare block which can be used, e.g., to measure timing of external events or output a PWM train (for digital to analog conversion).  The timers can also trigger the start of a DMA transfer or the start of an analog conversion.<p></i>A 1 million sample per second A to D converter with 12 bit resolution. The ADC has hardware decimation support (up to 64 samples), which can be used to trade off sample rate for sample resolution.  The converter also has a 12 channel input multiplexer.  Also, unlike the ADC in your sound card, this has DC-coupled input, so there's no lower cut-off frequency.<p><i>A DMA controller with support for scatter-gather modes. Transfers can be triggered by the completion of an A/D conversion, the comparators, the timers, or by software.<p></i>Two analog comparators: The comparator output can be used internally to trigger interrupts or start a conversion on the ADC.<p>*There are 8 UARTs, 4 synchronous serial ports, and one each I2C, CAN, and USB controller.  So you can talk to a lot of peripheral devices.  The UARTs support rates as high as 5 Mbps.<p>So, what do you want to do with these building blocks?  It's kind of up to you.  One application I can imagine is a substantially less-sucky (compared to all the other ones out there based on MCUs) audio-frequency oscilloscope.  The ADC sample rate is almost high enough to support it, particularly if you designed a decent front-end, and the analog comparators could be used to do interesting things with triggering (lots of MCUs try to fake it, badly, with software triggering).",1346622189

Apple's path to success should be winning customers, just like the chefs he describes, not through patent litigation.<p>The examples given by the OP actually support this point. It's true that Einstein didnt discover relativity first - both lorentz and poincare had worked out the mathematics, but Einstein articulated the concepts best. I often use this case study as an example of how innovations often arise independently from different inventors simultaneously because the conditions are right. The other famous and illustrative example is newton and leibniz inventing calculus independently.<p>As a VC, I see this all the time - the market conditions are right for a new idea, and suddenly 4 or 5 companies appear doing variations on the same thing, none aware of the others.

I currently have an MOG and Spotify subscription, but when a song hit's a sweet spot and I get emotionally attached, I end up buying it in the iTunes store. I most likely will start buying CD's again as soon as I get a new AV system, but if it wasn't for piracy I have no idea how I would of ever been so attached to music. All genres. Now with me going legal, MOG/Spotify act's as my piracy used to in letting me explore, and if the music touches me, I buy it. Only time I ""pirate"" is I want it in FLAC. There still isn't an option for lossless music online that satisfy my range of genres. <i>I still don't have the guts to delete my music collection though. </i><p>TLDR;<p>Used to pirate a lot, helped me be more open to listen to different types of music.

How much money do you want to be comfortable - pay all your bills, put an average amount away, and not ""worry"" about money.<p>3. What would be a realistic, ""reach"" amount for 2013?

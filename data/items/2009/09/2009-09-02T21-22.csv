801208,story,,,89,92,amohr,"Ask HN:  Am I crazy?",,"So I just graduated college in the spring and I have about $1500 in savings that I could spend on the deposit + rent/moving expenses for an apartment somewhere and continue looking for a job, but something in me is telling me there's a better way.  I have a plan, but I want to see if you guys think I'm crazy (If HN thinks it's too out there, then I know I'm off-base) or if I'm going to need more money or what.<p>I have known for some time that there's something different in the brain of an entrepreneur that changes the way they see the world, and I want to find out what that is.<p>So I want to set out to find entrepreneurs, either through appointment or serendipity, and spend a little time with them.  Just get to know how they decided to do what they do, what keeps them going, what their hopes and dreams are, etc.  I posit that there's commonalities to be found there and a lot of insight to be gained from those commonalities.  My contacts are somewhat slim, and it would probably be reasonable to spend a few years building up more, but something tells me now is the time to do this and it's getting harder and harder to ignore.<p>I spent some time as a freelance writer, so I believe I can make the result compelling and interesting.  But there's a lot of things I need to work out, and this is where I need your help:
- Do I have enough money to do this long enough to produce anything of substance? (numbers at the end of the post)
- How should I publish this?  It could be a blog that I update regularly, an ebook that I put together as I go, a physical book (leaning away from this for many reasons) or some combination thereof?
- Can I somehow monetize this as I'm working on it so as to extend my trip?
- How should I pitch the project to potential subjects?  Free publicity?  Altruism?<p>Numbers:
A trip from Chicago(where I live) to NY, boston, New Orleans, Austin, SF, Seattle, back to chicago is 7695 miles.  I'm thinking $700 for gas, oil changes, and some other tune-up stuff before I leave/along the way.  If I eliminate the west coast, this drops to around 4000 miles, If I just do SF and Seattle (this is probably what I'll end up doing) I end up with around 5000 miles.<p>I have no aversion to couch surfing, sleeping in my car or camping, all of which I've done plenty of.  With around 5 days of pure driving, I can spend a month doing this at just over $20/day to spend on food/bribery.<p>My hope would be to get around 15-20 case studies of at least an hour or so interview time, plus maybe shadowing and secondary interviews.  Though this is flexible.  I think this would be enough for a worthwhile product.<p>So.  Am I crazy?  Should I do it?  Suggestions?  Volunteers?  Donations...?<p>Also, you can email me at alex |at| mohrslaws.com",1251928740

These suboptimal choices Hanson points out signal to others the value of the less physically based motivations for themselves.  I start to lose hope if I think I'm the only one who has such ideals and somewhat question my own sanity.  But, when others signal that these ideals are actually crucial to their own decision making, I feel I'm not the only one and am more motivated to follow them.<p>But, how do such ideals related to naked self and societal interest?  Well, the ideals tend to motivate the deeper insights we generate, and motivate people to work together voluntarily without the overhead of contracts and reward/punishment systems.  I would argue that while perhaps inefficient in the short term, these ""biases"" actually turn out to be much, much more efficient in the long term.  I.e. just look at what happens when people do lose hope.  They don't suddenly become productivity monsters, instead they tend to turn both self and other destructive.

801198,comment,801113,801113,0,0,petesalty,,,"Ah, and here we have the crux of the problem with the software engineering hiring mindset today. 
Over the years I've hired many software engineers and I've never hired anyone based on their ability to write code, in fact I never even ask about it. It's completely irrelevant. Why? Because I've never hired code monkeys. Those I outsource. I hire engineers. Engineers need to be problem solvers, and based on the proper interview techniques we can ascertain if they're problem solvers or not. These people can learn just about any language quickly so familiarity is not an issue.
Want to know if someone understands recursion, ask them about recursion. Ask them about the theory of recursion, how to use it, where it's appropriate and possible downsides. Ask how they've successfully used it in the past, when they've used it and it's been a problem and how they solved that problem. Ask them when might be a good time in a project life cycle to reactor non-recursive code. But for gods sake, please, please, don't ask them to write a Fibonachi generator. This either proves that they just finished college, or have one memorized for just such an occasion.
Hire engineers, not code monkeys.<p>P.S. If you want to see some of the worst examples of this kind of abuse apply for any Ruby on Rails job at the moment - the stories I've heard boggle the mind.",1251928491

Replace ""great deceiver"" with ""computer simulation"" and the argument plays out the same way (albeit, with more probability in the modern case)<p>Ultimately, your existence is exactly what you perceive it to be.  Speculating on the nature of our existence, on this level, is indicative of those who don't have to pay their own rent :-) You can chase your own tail on this one literally forever.

A piece of phone malware is fairly limited. The botnet analogue is an auto-dialer, which completely ties up the phone's primary resource (its phone line). On a botnet, it may tie up a good portion of the computers connect, but enough gets through that the user just deals with it.<p>Actually, if all the malware was doing was draining the battery I doubt the phone users would notice at all. They would assume their phone was getting old and losing its charge, the same way users now assume the reason computers gets slow is because its getting old.<p>I just don't see any reason for phone-based malware. There are two types of malware: High intrusion and Low intrusion. High intrusion are things like Botnets and Auto-spammers. They tie up a lot of the computer's resources in order to make a profit off of them. The Low intrusion malware are things like tracking cookies and keyloggers. They exist because they gather data, and then send it en-masse to a server, where it is analysed and sold.<p>High intrusion on a phone does not have any place. The user will take their phone back to their provider because it doesn't work. You can't tie up just part of a phone line, its all or nothing. You could tie up part of the internet connection, but the user is paying for that out the nose and will notice any sizable use of the connection.<p>Low intrusion is possible, but users (at least from my experience) don't do anything particularly useful for that kind off malware on their phones. You can steal their browsing history (maybe), or their call logs/messenging, but the second isn't valuable (a little, but not much, definitely not worth the risk), and the first, from my experience isn't valuable. Users just don't go to those high value sites (bank sites and the like) on their phones.",1251925495

There is a larger risk in the quality of the code when you do this. If there is no tech founder, then most of the time you will have a harder time judging the developers you will be using (hiring/outsourcing to.)  It also means that you will have to pay for the development vs a co-founder putting in sweat equity to get the product done.<p>Based on your brief description, it sounds like there will not be a lot of heavy lifting to get the application up and running.  From personal experience, getting the MVP version of the app done is really the easy part.

I love how like-minded we are in trying to resolve/help each others, from technical, business or even personal side.<p>I have a new venture that we are currently launching called WebtoSmartphone.com. It's still in the early stage (on production site), and we have been working on this for quite some times now. No VC/Seed funding, just bootstrapping aside of fulltime jobs + Ramen diet :) It's doing a pretty good job converting most of the websites we own (in our network).<p>I had the idea for the service based on the need of my firm to convert existing websites to mobile and keeping the mobile site as authentic as possible to the actual website, not a wap-looking site, and hassle-free. There was and is many options on the market and we can see in the near future more and more of those options. Our humble goal is to provide a service that is affordable, pleasant and easy to use and that constantly synchronize your website with the mobile site without having to keep or host two separate versions. This is why we went for ""on-the-fly"" conversion.<p>It was a technological challenge, but our developers (Kudos to Gero and Adrian!) did a fantastic job in helping us achieving our challenges.<p>I (we) need your help to review the following aspects:<p>1. What do you think of the idea.<p>2. What do you think of the landing page<p>3. What do you think of the checkout page<p>4. What do you think of the process in general<p>5. Most important is: What can we do better?<p>There is still work ahead of us in keeping up with the technical optimization side: development, improving conversion speed and Business side: Sales, Marketing, (By the way we are looking for white label partners, so if you are interested for that or just connect with us (we are socal based), please drop us a line to hello@mobileappamerica.com, subject HN :))<p>This is my first time actually using ""Ask HN"", all your positives ideas and feedbacks are highly welcomed!

Like FreeBSD, they do take a lot of things from upstream (e.g. both use X.Org as their X11 server), but also like FreeBSD, they heavily customize the core packages and develop them so they work together well. There are core Debian teams working on its versions of the Linux kernel (<a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/DebianKernel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.debian.org/DebianKernel</a>), X.org (<a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce</a>), Exim MTA (<a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4</a>), package manager (<a href=""http://wiki.debian.org/Apt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.debian.org/Apt</a>), etc., along with thousands of Debian-specific patches to other packages, which are maintained as far as possible in an integrated manner to meet the unified Debian system policies.<p>It's not entirely identical, but I don't think it's <i>that</i> far off.

8074684,comment,8072730,8073597,4,0,adamtj,,,"Genius?<p>A weak man can lift a small rock.  A strong man can lift a large rock.  But to lift a ten ton boulder, you need a crane.  Even a weak man can operate a crane, if he knows how.<p>Your genius is like a strong but stupid man.  Maybe he or she can lift a 1400 line &#x27;if&#x27; rock, I mean block, but that&#x27;s probably the limit.  Any more would require a different mode of operation -- the programming equivalent of using a crane.<p>The point is that people who haven&#x27;t broken the 1500 line wall will write code with no structure.  That&#x27;s <i>why</i> they can&#x27;t break through the wall.  That&#x27;s the heaviest code they can lift without assistance.<p>Certainly there are well structured 1500 line programs.  But those overwhelmingly come from people who have broken through that limit.  The people who know how to use a crane will tend to use them even for smaller projects.<p>Why would I go to all the trouble to use a giant crane just to lift a smallish 20 kg (40 lbs) rock?  Because then I won&#x27;t get tired or strain my back.  So I can lift another.  And another, and another.  I can do this all day without breaking a sweat.  The strong man is tired and sore and worn out from just a few dozen small rocks, while I&#x27;m still fresh, still going, and still able to lift multi-ton boulders.",1406127568

I mean, your project&#x27;s community should consist of people who use or are interested in using your code.  Whether it be hosted on github, launchpad, your own yourproject.com or another server capable of hosting the project.  Hosting it is technical details; people should come to the project for what it is, not for where it is hosted at.  Therefore the community shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;github community&quot; or &quot;sourceforge community&quot; or whatever.  Or did you mean communities such as &quot;git users&quot;, &quot;cvs users&quot; and so on?  I think that&#x27;s still the wrong way to think of it.  It sounds like a religious cult formed around specific tools.<p>They&#x27;re just tools.

But otherwise, they could fall onto a lot of places and things without further consequences.<p>If you consider a city like Los Angeles, with 3792621 inhabitants, and a surface of 1215e6 m², assuming each person takes 1 m² (ie. the person-drone cross section), that gives for fall points equidistributed over the surface a probability of hitting a person of 3792621/1215e6 = 0.0031; only 0.31% per fall!  To hit a person with 1/2 probability, you&#x27;d need a rainfall of 160 drones!<p>Will your drone fly over crowded areas?  Most people are inside houses most of the time anyways, and there&#x27;s no reason to fly over the sideways.<p>Now, you must also consider other areas to avoid landing (or falling) on.  Cars, (streets), random machinery (eg. air conditioners), power lines, etc.  But all in all, that still leaves a lot of places where to crash with no consequence, if you need to crash.<p>IMO, there&#x27;s a lot of unreasonned fears about the subject (as there is about anything else; and people wonder in other threads, why the belief that humans use only 10% of their brains persists...).",1406127480
8074676,comment,8070737,8071024,1,0,tigeba,,,"You may want to check out Everquest Next.  I think it would be fair to say that EQN is very close to a completely voxelized environment and at least mostly procedural.  There is a great deal of curated content as well, but it seems like they are working on sourcing lots of that from players.  The voxelized environment in  EQN is based on Miguel Cepero&#x27;s work.  I believe they in fact hired him.  I have been reading his blog for a long time and you can get a pretty good idea of the techniques that are being used.<p><a href=""http://procworld.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://procworld.blogspot.com/</a><p>A couple of quick hints to get you going in the right direction is that there are ( I believe ) a couple of generalized tricks involved to pull this off well.  The first is using the &#x27;correct&#x27; method to tesselate your voxel geometry.  Minecraft literally uses cubes and you are familiar with the result.  Another &#x27;classic&#x27; method is the application of marching cubes/tetrahedra.  This gives you fairly good organic-ish shapes but suffers from the inability to render sharp edges.  Everything looks blobby.  I believe the method used by EQN makes use dual-contouring, or a variant, which allows you to create organic shapes and also preserve sharp edges.  A second factor is the ability to use different levels of resolution or scale for your voxels situationally.  This allows you to craft human-scale things like cups and swords and whatnot, with human-scale details, and still craft houses and mountains and trees, without the need for storing extreme resolution in those items as well.  It can be very tricky to patch together various bits of geometry tessellated from different voxel resolutions like this, and not end up with ugly visual artifacts.  There is also the thorny issue of applying textures or materials to everything I have mentioned previously, which I have never investigated :)",1406127440

8074666,comment,8069893,8073931,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"On a literal basis it is racist because you invoke race. On a logical basis it is racist because you ignore context and treat the use of a word based on the color of the skin of the person using it. On a moral basis it is racist because one group getting offended is not any more or less valid than some other group getting offended.<p>Most importantly, the fact that the word is offensive to someone does not <i>invalidate</i> the racist double-standard. That&#x27;s what context means: that the use of a word or phrase has multiple properties. On the one hand, use of the word by a white person is offensive. On the other hand, saying a white person can not use that word is racist. Both of these things are true at the same time.<p>You can attempt to gloss over these facts by saying &quot;oh, historical use&quot; or &quot;oh, it&#x27;s offensive&quot; and many other reasons, but that does not remove the racism inherent to the double standard which is based on the color of the skin of the speaker.

And if either of them was to try to ride the other&#x27;s bike, they would have lots of small annoyances and pain points.<p>Try watching someone who is an expert at Cocoa/XCode and you will see that they also have extremely tight, natural interaction with their toolset. They know where the rough corners are and avoid them. Their environment is already configured so that builds just work. etc.<p>Those of us who work in the browser have similar tools and workflows so that, once we have them working well and meld with the tools, we work very productively.

8074653,comment,8073732,8073732,6,0,jonnathanson,,,"This is a fantastic list, and it is extremely helpful to have everything in one place. The next step, IMO, is for folks like us in the HN community to put a little more meat on the bone. Annotate or link to this list with specifics for each model.<p>I might quibble, on a very minor level, with calling these &quot;business models.&quot; More accurately, they are revenue sources. One could argue that this is a small distinction, but there is a real difference. A revenue source is necessary, but not sufficient, for the operation of a healthy business. Plenty of other things go into the mix, even leaving aside the obvious (product): COGS, logistics, competitive differentiators, etc. There is so much more to the success of Uber, for example, than just the &quot;excess-capacity market&quot; revenue model. All of what Uber does with its drivers on the back end, for instance, is quite sophisticated -- and equally responsible for the company&#x27;s success as its top-line, nominal model.<p>Further annotation -- and I&#x27;m happy to get my hands dirty and contribute -- will also help us flesh out the pros and cons of some of these models. &quot;Pay-what-you-want,&quot; for instance, lists Radiohead as the example. That&#x27;s fine. But what a lot of folks don&#x27;t realize is that Radiohead made approximately 80% of its money from the &quot;In Rainbows&quot; album release by selling collector&#x27;s edition box sets for $81 a pop. In that case, pay-what-you-want served as a loss leader and demand driver, and the collector&#x27;s sets earned the real money. Either of these tactics, without the other, would not have worked as well. The combination of the two was a stroke of genius -- allowing the band&#x27;s customers to segment themselves, and in effect, adding an ultra-premium tier to the top of the &quot;pay what you want&quot; curve. The operative lesson of Radiohead&#x27;s experiment was that pay-what-you-want <i>can</i> be effective, but you need to structure the pay scale to account for your customer segments&#x27; different willingness to pay for different versions of the same product. Give them suggestions, at both the low end and the high end of the product/price spectrum. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re anchoring everyone towards the low end. And that leaves a lot of money on the table. This lesson has carried over to sites like Kickstarter, to great effect. (I have no idea if Kickstarter took any inspiration from Radiohead&#x27;s experiment; this is just a thematic observation.)",1406127162

High-voltage DC runs just fine on regular copper. (In fact, in some cases you only need a single conductor because you can use the Earth as the return. This isn&#x27;t typically in the design spec, but it&#x27;s sometimes used as a backup plan.) <i>Low-voltage</i> DC requires superconductors, because pushing low-voltage <i>anything</i> any distance requires superconductors.<p>The only reason most transmission is over AC today is Tesla (the man, not the car) didn&#x27;t have power electronics to step-up or step-down voltage.

I want to throw out a few thoughts about the lifecycle of myths:<p>1. Myths are interesting and tell a story that resonates with their audience. This helps get them in our brains in the first place.<p>2. Myths are credible, at least at first. Perhaps they are based on scientific argumentation or conventional wisdom or (somewhat limited) experience. This gives a myth a mental foothold.<p>3. Some myths are untestable, at least practically speaking from the perspective of people that believe them. So myth-based knowledge tends to linger.<p>4. Myths may be repeated (like memes) simply due to associative memory. People&#x27;s brains work largely by association, so many myths spread because they give a person something interesting to say. This gives myths a way to spread.<p>5. To some degree, myths are busted for various reasons.

Most of my issues have been with homebrew formulas that aren&#x27;t updated to work with 10.10 (mongodb is the one on the top of my head). Other than that, the only real issue I&#x27;ve had is with installs. Each update has taken upwards of an hour and a half to install while it constantly tells me 4 minutes remaining. Post install, pretty smooth though.<p>Things I&#x27;m regularly using without issue: PyCharm, Thunderbird, Chrome, Firefox, Subline Text 2, and iTerm",1406124034

At $400, it becomes a &quot;free&quot; phone, which means it&#x27;s less valuable and not comparable to iPhone or Galaxy S.<p>Most people they are selling to don&#x27;t buy their phone for real price, so what you&#x27;re really talking about is up to $200 difference. If they priced it less than $400, they&#x27;d lose money in the subsidy and AT&T basically would make money on the deal.<p>At the end of the day the consumer isn&#x27;t going to see it as a super expensive smartphone. They&#x27;re going to see it as costing the same as the iPhone or Galaxy S.<p>Nobody says the iPhone or Galaxy S are too expensive.",1406124005

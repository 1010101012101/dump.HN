Furthermore, instead of costs to rebrand their work (which would have been questionable enough), they asked for full development costs plus anticipated sales, which would suggest they had no intention of releasing anything.",1292712911

Every inventor has an ownership of the invention and initially has an ownership of the patent that results from it.

But if they did not get all inventors to sign, and an unnamed inventor can later prove that he/she was actually one of the inventors, then the unnamed inventor will be held to be part owner of the patent and any inventions that are listed in there.<p>Thus, a company can invest tens of thousands of dollars into a patent and millions of dollars into developing the patented technology and then an unnamed inventor may appear out of the blue and claim ownership.<p>So yes, it is important to name all the actual inventors.<p>BTW, this is not legals advice, just academic, theoretic discussion.

The consistent employment is the hard part.<p>In my experience one can make $100/hr+ as an iPhone contractor, but only in small chunks. It's getting harder, too, because there are now plenty of good-enough people who will charge less. Python + Javascript is hard, because there are loads of good people who will work full time for far less.<p>One rule of thumb I've found for maximizing contract rates, is that the best paying jobs are usually with huge rich non-technical companies that are kind of internally screwed up and are trying to solve their software problems by throwing money at them.<p>Thus, the best bet for making $200K as a contractor is to do something kind of horrible, like being a consultant at a bank or oil company fixing up a botched Oracle Financials install, or something like that.

9249031,comment,9247460,9248954,0,0,TestTube_Andy,,,"Thanks for playing.  It&#x27;s an interesting question about the huge-and-instantaneous acceleration when the raptor stops.  The way I treated it when making the game was that the spacebar is equivalent to applying an acceleration exactly equal to (minus) your speed divided by the timestep of the game.  Which means from one frame to the next you&#x27;ll go from moving to stopped.<p>So from a technical perspective, the acceleration isn&#x27;t infinite, since it happens over the course of a single frame.  Of course, that reveals one of the odd parts about having discrete time-steps (frame, frame, frame) instead of continuous time.<p>Practically, the acceleration it would take to stop you <i>that</i> suddenly would indeed be immense, and certainly the forces would be enough to tear a normal velociraptor&#x27;s claws right off her feet. (Luckily, VR is no <i>normal</i> raptor)<p>If you do want to be able to see the acceleration, you can always use the arrow keys to slow down... or hold down an arrow key as you hit the spacebar (that decreases the &#x27;braking&#x27; acceleration)",1427074652

Specifically, you&#x27;re conflating parameter passing semantics with reference type semantics. The problem with this conflation is that reference type semantics cover more situations than merely parameter passing, so when you conflate the two concepts, you miss out on the remaining bits. Consider this:<p><pre><code>    Foo x = new Foo();
    x.setBar(42);
    Foo y = x;
    y.setBar(0);
    assert(x.getBar() == 42); // fails! astonishing behaviour!
</code></pre>
If the value of x was assigned to y, surely modifying y shouldn&#x27;t affect x, right? That&#x27;s what assignment does, it takes the value on the right and puts it in the location on the left, correct? So why on earth was x modified when we only called a mutator method on y?<p>To understand this, you need to know that Java objects are reference types. And this has nothing to do with parameter passing.<p>And once you understand reference type semantics, you don&#x27;t need anything extra to understand parameter passing, because parameter passing in Java uses the same semantics as assignment: that is, the value of the actual parameter is copied into the formal parameter, just like values on the right of an assignment are copied into the locations on the left. It&#x27;s pass by copy.",1427074103

True that Vancouver may have higher public transit ridership, but what they neglect to mention is that different cities may have solved the public transit problem in a different way.<p>First off, many major tech companies SF (and to some extent in Seattle) offer private buses. Automatically, these people are no longer counted by the study. In a city like SF where there is a huge Google/Facebook/Adobe/Company XYZ population, they all offer buses or shuttles from urban areas to Palo Alto, Cupertino, and even within other places in SF. Nonetheless, almost 100% of the people I talk to that lives in SF either doesn&#x27;t own a car or owns a car but almost never drives it because their companies offer alternative transportations. They also don&#x27;t ride the BART or Muni or CalTrain much because of Uber/Lyft.<p>Secondly, places like NYC, SF and Seattle have a big ride sharing culture. Obvious Uber and Lyft are prevalent around the city with their staches&#x27; and U&#x27;s. Recent stats in NYC indicates that there are now more Uber drivers than taxi drivers. These ride sharing economy definitely takes the ridership out of public transit. In fact, on my recent trip to SF I decided to take Uber to my door instead of the normal BART because they cost similar except I don&#x27;t have to get off at a BART station and transfer somehow. Compare that to Vancouver, where Uber and Lyft are outlawed, with the city even going to extra step to make sure they don&#x27;t even get a start over existing taxi services, it&#x27;s definitely going to push more people to public transit.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think this article or study is even non-partisan at all because of the upcoming city-wide transit referendum.

There are a few reasons for me.<p>First, check out this video. Personally I think the watch is ugly as hell, but if anything shows you some of the craftsmanship that goes into a watch, this would be it: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXPplShtg0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXPplShtg0</a><p>Another reason is that I&#x27;m a programmer and clockwork is a form of programming. I don&#x27;t know much about watchmaking (I&#x27;m hoping to eventually go to watchmaking school - not for many years though I imagine) but I read quite a bit about it and it fascinates me. It&#x27;s similar to how the idea of programming on an incredibly old computer with practically no resources fascinates me. Complaining about only having 2K of memory? At least you&#x27;ve got electricity!<p>There&#x27;s a hell of a lot of invention and, well, hacking that goes into watchmaking too. Take the perpetual calendar, for example - a type of watch that only needs to be adjusted once every 100 years because it tracks leap years. Moon phases that are accurate for 5400 years[1]. Planetariums on your wrist, all powered by clockwork[2]. Dials that take a century to complete a rotation.<p>I also love the human aspect of watchmaking. The level of craftsmanship in a high end watch, such as the Patek Philippe you saw in the video, is incredible. I love the attention to detail and the care that goes into every single component: even components that are buried deep inside the watch are still polished and decorated by hand. Pointless? Yes! But I can&#x27;t help but love it.<p>You mention supply chain sophistication and you might be right - but don&#x27;t think that the supply chains for watches aren&#x27;t sophisticated. If you&#x27;re interested, Hodinkee.com recently published an article about their tour around the Rolex manufacture. You might be interested in the level of complexity: <a href=""http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/inside-rolex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/inside-rolex</a>
It&#x27;s a long article but if you search for &quot;Parachrom Hairspring&quot;, that section will give you a bit of insight into the kind of invention that goes into modern watchmaking.<p>However, after all of that justification, I&#x27;ll fully admit that it&#x27;s pointless. A $100 quartz watch is typically more accurate than a $10,000 mechanical. It&#x27;s pretty much all about emotion, similar to how some people can become attached to paintings where all others see is paint on canvas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://monochrome-watches.com/a-worlds-first-christiaan-van-der-klaauw-real-moon-tides-indicates-the-sea-level-tides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monochrome-watches.com/a-worlds-first-christiaan-van-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vancleefarpels.com/us/en/article/10935/midnight-planetarium-timepiece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vancleefarpels.com/us/en/article/10935/midnight-p...</a><p>(Hm, I wrote quite a bit more than I intended to and must have given you at least an hours worth of reading/watching material!

It was a glowing dial Tag F1.  I didn&#x27;t realize at the time,  but it was considered a unisex size.  I didn&#x27;t care, I had small wrists.  I bought it for $139.00.  Jump ahead years later, and the company realized they could add $1000-2000 to that price and still sell watches?

If you do buy a mechanical watch, I can pass this along.  You don&#x27;t need to service it yearly.  Service it when the time is off, or it stops.  Change the gaskets every two years(if you go in the water).  I guarantee most of you can change the back gasket and crown gasket without much study.<p>(Tag does use some ETA 2824-2 movements.

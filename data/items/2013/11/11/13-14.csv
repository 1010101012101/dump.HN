For the companies running ships, the more efficient the plant is, the more money they save on fuel. About ten years ago we did a rough back of the envelope calculation in one of my engineering classes when I asked a similar question. The extra weight of the solar panels would negate any small benefit they would provide plus the cost of maintaining extra equipment. A lot modern ships run a shaft generator which uses the power from the shaft turning the propellor to turn an alternator to make electricity. When the ship slows down at the end of the trip, they go back to running smaller &#x27;port&#x27; generators.",1384178251

6711555,comment,6708664,6710943,1,0,steveridout,,,"Adding a hover pop up after selecting a word/phrase could be a nice feature. It would be easier to implement if I had my own database of definitions/translations instead of relying on external dictionaries in an iframe like the current sidebar. Note that one of the reasons I&#x27;ve avoided implementing important features on hover so far is to ensure that everything works well on touch devices.<p>Not sure how to enable selecting text in a nice way given the current UI. Would probably need a way to temporarily disable the current word selection feature. Hmmm... actually one way would be to add a keyboard modifier to temporarily enable native OS selecting for advanced users without cluttering the UI for regular users.<p>Personal word lists: I&#x27;ve avoided tagging, folders or lists for organising words so far because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d personally use them, but it&#x27;s certainly something I&#x27;ll consider for the future, especially if enough people request it.<p>I&#x27;ll keep your suggestions in mind, and if you want to encourage the development of any specific feature please add or vote for it on the uservoice page: <a href=""https://readlang.uservoice.com/forums/192149-general/filters/top"" rel=""nofollow"">https://readlang.uservoice.com/forums/192149-general/filters...</a><p>Thanks again!",1384178164

6711552,comment,6711348,6711348,12,0,brokenparser,,,"Debian describes OCaml as follows:<p>Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.<p>OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,  generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation: almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.<p>The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not available on all arches though.",1384178149

Code is to be read by people. Here is a lisp version of the first snippet in the blog post:<p><pre><code>  (defun formatted-zip-code (digits)\n    (case (length digits)\n      (4 (format nil &quot;0~A&quot; digits))\n      (3 (format nil &quot;00~A&quot; digits))\n      (otherwise digits)))\n</code></pre>\nThe syntax is a bit different from Ruby, but there isn&#x27;t a single concept here a programmer doesn&#x27;t know.<p>My theory about why such cryptic code gets associated with lisp is because too many people were told they can learn something profound about programming by just jerking around with scheme without actually using it. So a lot of people just play around with abstractions without actually trying to build anything. That might be useful as much as any abstract task is useful(does solving sudoku puzzles make you a better programmer?), but not as useful as these people think. IOW it&#x27;s just code masturbation.

You can agree with your colleagues or friends explicitly on style conventions, or you can roll with organically created conventions.  But to say that you can write code devoid of design decisions and stylistic choices is foolish (again, all buildings and bridges are designed objects, and sure there are best practices for how concrete is poured, but to declare that construction has no craftsmanship is incorrect).<p>Beyond that, the utility of forcing others to adhere to your style is one that should be more rigorously considered.  My vast preference is to ensure that large engineering structures are constructed of compact and well factored components with sane/intuitive APIs, regardless of what their internal stylistic choices are w/r/t formatting.<p>Having a global style guide across multiple projects might be nice, but it also might be stymieing in terms of iterating towards better practices.",1384175324

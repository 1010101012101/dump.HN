Sheep were one of the largest commodities in Mesopotamian trade, and yet only a handful of tokens matching that crossed-disk shape have ever been discovered. If transactions involving sheep were taking place daily, they should be among the most plentiful of tokens. These token systems are an ingenious human invention, but they should be seen as the precursors to mathematical accounting, not writing.",1432627099

That was even before uber. The driver (a licensed taxi) was ranting about the fact that there were too many taxis.

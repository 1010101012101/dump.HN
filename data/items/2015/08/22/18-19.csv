10103290,comment,10098998,10101689,0,0,MyDogHasFleas,,,"This is a little mixed up. First trivial point you meant &quot;virtualization&quot; not &quot;visualization&quot;. Second, the only thing the 360/67 had (and that was carried forward to the 370 &quot;Advanced Function&quot; line) was a mode bit in the PSW for virtual mode, and the fact that supervisor-state instructions would cleanly trap to the kernel if executed in user mode. There was no &quot;hypervisor hardware&quot;, it was all software, specifically the Control Program or CP portion of CP/CMS.<p>The thing that the System/360 architecture got right was a clean exception mechanism when an attempt was made to execute a &quot;privileged instruction&quot; when in user mode. Privileged instructions were all those that operating systems used to manage and run applications. By having a clean exception/trap mechanism, the hypervisor was made feasible, because it could run the virtual machine in user mode, let the S/360 hardware do all the normal user-mode instructions natively, and trap out to the hypervisor when a privileged instruction was run.<p>Kudos to Andris Padegs and his original System/360 architecture team for having the foresight in the early 60s to implement the instruction set in this way.<p>If you looked at the source code of VM/370 CP, which all came from CP/67, you would see code which intercepts exceptions caused by user mode applications attempting to execute supervisor instructions such as SIO (Start I/O) or LPSW (Load PSW), and emulates them like the real S/370 hardware would do. Therefore, a user-mode application could actually be an operating system that thought it was running on real hardware.<p>SIO is the fundamental way that an OS communicates with I/O devices, all of which were virtualized by CP. LPSW is how an OS dispatches one of its tasks, so CP virtualizes the hardware state and switches the virtual CPU from virtual supervisor to virtual user mode. Of course it&#x27;s all much more complex than that.<p>In particular, CP could virtualize an operating system that itself did virtual memory and acted as a hypervisor. If the virtual OS was itself a hypervisor, it would run its second level virtual OSes in (virtual) user mode. The first-level CP would get a privileged instruction exception, and would look a the virtual machine&#x27;s virtual state and see that it was in virtual user mode. Thus, it would simulate a privileged-instruction execution exception <i>in the virtual machine</i>, which in turn would emulate that privileged instruction for the second-level virtual OS.<p>The most difficult and compute intensive work was in simulating the virtual memory hardware of a virtual machine that was itself using virtual memory for its user tasks, or in the case of a second level hypervisor, its virtual machines. We had to have code in CP that simulates the translate lookaside buffer for the virtual machine, and also does direct lookups within the virtual page and segment tables maintained by the virtual OS.<p>But it all worked, and we could happily run virtual OSes like OS/VS1, OS/VS2 (later called MVS), and CP itself, underneath CP as virtual machines.<p>However, as you could imaging, performance was not great for many workloads. So, the hardware engineers in Endicott and Poughkeepsie came up with &quot;Virtual Machine Assist&quot; microcode, which would step in and run the high-use hypervision directly in microcode on the hardware, which was an order of magnitude faster than doing it in S/70 instructions. A good example is Load Real Address (LRA), which could be run very quickly in microcode.<p>I spent thousands of hours working on the CP source code, first as a user, then as a developer and design manager at IBM in the early days of VM/370 and VM/SP. I was too young to have been involved in the Cambridge Scientific Center&#x27;s early work on the 360/44 and later the 360/67, but did get to meet and talk with some of the original people.",1440268485

In Frank McSherry&#x27;s Rust stuff and the Naiad stuff they seem to have a basic data structure of progress and &quot;data to process&quot;.  Where progress is handling the time step of the process.  The dataflow isn&#x27;t anything more than a variable being passed around and inputs and outputs.  So the control structure is the important part.<p>This is sort of rambly, but in pd/max/msp you end up with at least 2 types of data flow rates (common in musical stuff like supercollider as well) for musical sample rates (aka 44.1khz or whatnot) and &#x27;control flow&#x27; rates (like an LFO wub at 120bpm half notes).  Those are all still wired up with the same &quot;lines&quot; in pd so it can end up being confusing if you put a control rate into a sample rate or vice versa.  I&#x27;m sure current MaxMSP has ways to separate and handle those (along w/ &quot;bangs&quot; which are one off messages), but the beauty of something like drakon is that it is just control flow.  The data is explicitly defined in the boxes. So even though dataflow is the phrase google and microsoft are throwing around, the real art is in the control flow.

10103232,comment,10102925,10102925,0,0,jbeales,,,"I&#x27;m not convinced this guy isn&#x27;t on some vendetta. He only quotes total numbers, not accidents per thousand miles / deaths per thousand miles.<p>If I understand the these DOT numbers[1,2] properly the number of truck miles from 2009 to 2013 has dropped, which would be especially bad if the number of accidents has ridden, but that doesn&#x27;t jibe with a) the 2008 recession ending and b) increased truck sales over the past 5 years[3]. The trucking industry publications I&#x27;ve been reading are generally in agreement that trucking demand exceeds capacity, and that demand has been steadily increasing since 2008.<p>He&#x27;s right that some of the safety regulations have changed recently, and to the layman it appears that they have changed to be less safe. For example, as of this past June, drivers hauling oversize/overweight loads no longer have to take a 30-minute break that was formerly required. However, part of that reasoning was that it can be <i>more dangerous</i> for oversize trucks to be parked, especially at night, than it is for them to continue driving straight through[4].<p>The 30-minute break exemption has been granted in several other situations as well, for example when hauling HazMat that requires the driver to &quot;attend,&quot; or supervise the vehicle even when it&#x27;s stopped, since this is defined as an on-duty activity the driver would either have to eliminate the break, or stop supervising the load, so he/she would have to break a law no matter what, so it was decided that the 30-minute break would become optional.<p>About on-truck technology to make the road safer, it&#x27;s a good idea, but it needs to work right every time. I&#x27;ve spoken to my business partner about it, (he&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s been through the whole trucking industry from driving right up to management), and in his other job, where he manages a trucking company, they&#x27;ve had demonstration units with all kinds of collision warnings, lane departure warnings, blind-spot warnings, and so on. They found that the alarms went off way too often when there was no problem - to the point where none of the drivers wanted to take these brand-new demonstration trucks out on a run. And the article&#x27;s posterboy crash - the Tracy Morgan accident, was a new truck with those bells & whistles installed. The problem there was the driver&#x27;s commute time to get to work.<p>Finally, the article reads as if the trucking industry wants to be unsafe. This is simply not true. There are jerks that drive trucks, just like there are jerks that drive 4-wheelers, but there&#x27;s a culture of safety in trucking that really impresses me. Safety records for both drivers and companies, including inspection results, are tracked by the US government. If a driver&#x27;s record is too bad no company will take them on, and if a carrier&#x27;s record is too bad it will be prohibited from operating. Most of the &quot;trucking industry&quot; is truck drivers, and a truck driver&#x27;s top priority is arriving alive and uninjured.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2010/vm1.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2010/v...</a>\n[2]<a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2013/vm1.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2013/v...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.ttnews.com/articles/printopt.aspx?storyid=37081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ttnews.com/articles/printopt.aspx?storyid=37081</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://www.ccjdigital.com/oversizeoverweight-interstate-haulers-granted-exemption-to-30-minute-break-rule/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccjdigital.com/oversizeoverweight-interstate-haul...</a>",1440267468

10103197,comment,10102925,10103002,0,0,Aloha,,,"I&#x27;m a former over the road truck driver who hauled truckload freight.<p>I disagree profoundly that self driving trucks are the future, the future is multimodal transport, even now a significant proportion of long haul (greater than 3-600 miles) is already on the rail, either in the form of a container or piggyback.<p>The issue that keeps the remaining long haul (greater than 600 miles) on the road (vs rail) is timing, when you put something on the rail, you loose a day or so at one end in loading/classifying and another in classifying/unloading. That time loss is something that in all but a few situations can be accommodated for by extra planning - but it requires the planning and consent of the shipper and consignee to do so - the trucking and rail companies are already on board as shipping by rail is much cheaper/easier.<p>For LTL companies, most of their drivers only run from terminal to terminal, and the distance driven and time spent is much much lower, but even with them, a crossdock transload facility where one side is a truck dock, and the other is a railcar could for example cut down on some logistics pain - but it still would incur additional delay due to the machinations required by the railroad to switch and deliver cars in their network.<p>Another complicating factor is reefers, right now each refer either has a generator attached (for containers) to it powered by diesel fuel, or has a diesel powered refrigeration unit on the trailer - this for the rail could be replaced by freight trains with HEP (head end power) to power the refrigeration units - but to do so requires a sizable investment by everyone involved (rail cars that support such a system, cans and trailers that support such a system, and transit yards that can supply the power to keep everything cold)<p>Even with the challenges, in 20-30 years, I&#x27;d expect only 10% of truckload miles to be actually hauled end to end by a truck, the rest of it should go on the rail, then be carried the proverbial last mile (in reality couple hundred miles) by a truck.<p>As a former driver, in my opinion the issue is not the HOS (hours of service) rules, its the way companies, especially many smaller ones dispatch their drivers - you can be expected to go from working days, to working nights instantly, and it can really fuck hardcore with your sleep schedule.",1440267046

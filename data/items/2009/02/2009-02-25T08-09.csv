You can think of the lookup chain for a variable as being part of a data structure being passed in to a function.  It is just as easy to design a convoluted data structure that gets passed in to a function as it is to design a convoluted object hierarchy.<p>The difference is that you can't get implicit lookups for free in an fp language unless you implement something like messageSend(name, obj, args).",1235551954

The people there had nothing, usually not even power, and our own accommodations weren't exactly... modern. I swore that I'd never forget how good I had it here, and indeed I didn't for a long time -- I even came to severely resent ""Westerners"" for a while.<p>During my ""time of appreciation"" lets say, I was <i>very</i> happy. I found joy and worth in the simplest of things, from showering with clean water to drinking a beer. Unfortunately, over time I once again became acclimated to my environment and now likely take things as much for granted as I did a few years ago.<p>I've found it takes a large amount of conscious effort to not fall into this same trap. It seems to be very much a case of ""out of sight, out of mind""; the things I saw and experienced are mere vague memories now and somehow life has a way of blinding me from what I was once acutely aware: that no matter how bad I have it, others have it worse than I used to be able to imagine.",1235551719

Television is available over bit torrent as well, and a lot of people use it to download shows.  But now that hulu is around a lot of people are getting the same desire met through a channel that compensates the copyright holders.<p>I'm not sure what the corresponding setup would be for music.",1235551160

I've found one mention of it, so I thought I'd pass along Steve Yegge's opinion:<p>""Incidentally, if you want to fine-tune this tip to extraordinary levels, then you probably don't want to use your ring-finger for typing the x-key when you hit Ctrl-x. I use my left index finger, since I'm used to it that way, but you're probably better off using your left middle finger. The reason is that your hand isn't technically on home row when your left pinkie is jammed down on the Caps-Lock key that you've turned into Ctrl. The point is to use whatever requires the least amount of stretching, followed by the least amount of finger motion. You should experiment until you find what's most comfortable for you.""<p>Found that here: <a href=""http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/effective-emacs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/effective-emacs</a>",1235550825

It's unnecessary and counter-productive.

494139,comment,491515,491746,0,0,thwarted,,,"And that's the irony of it.  Why do companies think they are going to innovate in the area of personnel management, time tracking, accounting and payroll in such a way that it'll give them an advantage over their competitors who also need to do this?  These are commodity processes, or should be, and should be deployed from proven, mature technologies.  The fact that they are commodities means they should be cheap.  The fact that this isn't the case means this industry is broken (again most likely because the people tasked with deploying these processes/services are not going to be the ones using them).",1235549673
494137,comment,493712,493712,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"These guys are awesome and I feel kind of bad to say this, but it's the perferction of a failed idea. I've been trying these kinds of GUI builders for almost 20 years, starting with VB and PowerBuilder, and I always ended up not actually using them.<p>The usual criticism is that they generate awful code, but that's not necessarily the case. The problem is really that these tools ask you to keep clicking on lots of little sliders and lines and bars and shapes and then click over there in that text box to enter a name and then select this or that from a list or menu, wait until that three pixel graphic changes its shape into a handle so you can drag that line over here, etc, and there's no way to automate this.<p>It's a matter of taste whether you like to do it that way when you create _one_ form, but once you create an application or two or three you have to abstract from the repeating patterns and you can't do that with the GUI builder.<p>GUI builders make you stay on the same level of abstraction forever because they don't have the equivalent of meta programming or even just plain procedural programming.<p>The reason why code built with GUI builders is so awful is not so much that they necessarily generate bad code. It's that developers who can put up with repeating the same clicks and drags on the same level of abstraction for years and years are in the wrong profession and create bad code regardless of the tools.<p>Programming is all about abstracting and automating stuff. The pinnacle of GUI builder based abstraction is what Microsoft calls ""user controls"". All they abstract is a bunch of widgets statically glued together on a panel. Great, but that's like 5% of what you want to do.<p>I'm afraid GUI builders are hopeless for any serious programming.",1235549499

It makes me feel better on two levels, first that a lot of the ideas of how to make it work are similar to what I had in mind and have started to document, although you've gone into much more detail.<p>Second, I find it very interesting that you're still handling support, and something of a relief - it means I've got a lot of runway before I have to think seriously of giving that up.

2767354,comment,2761014,2766907,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"On Smith's article and a voting system, uh, I read Smith's article ASAP!  I was assuming, without careful checking, that Smith's article was much like that of this thread.  Looks like you got me in some too fast reading!<p>Yes, it looks like these articles are for biomedical work.  I'm sure it's different in many small respects and maybe some larger ones.<p>Uh, I said that the present system makes a good ""effort"", and you countered with some of the problems with the ""results""!  You may be right!<p>The ""correlation"" is not very impressive:  The review process is not quite that simple.  Here's a dark, dirty little secret:  Often at some point in the toughest part of the paper, some reviewer thinks, ""I tried to look up the background for that, and I don't have the prerequisites even for the background.  I can't take out a year to study to be ready to read this paper.  The parts of the paper I can read look rock solid.  The new parts I can read look nice.  His references are high quality.  His writing is carefully done.  He doesn't make wild claims.  It looks like a solid piece of work.  I can't find anything wrong with it.  Let him publish it:  If it has a big error, then maybe that will come out and be on him.  I'll give him a pass and go to dinner."" or some such.  So in this case correlation doesn't mean much!<p>""Many journals follow anonymous reviewing and forbid distribution of preprints.""  Sure.  In most simple respects, the paper is still all locked up until it appears in print maybe two years after submission.  Still work goes on!  So, the author of the paper can present parts of the work in lectures and seminars.  Guys down the hall know and can start working on extensions.  The author can work on extensions and give talks and reference the paper as ""in submission"".  Generally the word gets around!  Net, the publication delay doesn't much slow the actual research work.  That is, the actual exploitation of the work in the paper doesn't really start just with the publication and people reading that,  Instead, 'the word gets around'.<p>""The other point, which he does not make, is that referees have very little incentive, besides the opinion of the editorial board, to do their job properly.""  The referees have a LOT of ""incentive ... to do their work properly"" if they want progress in their academic careers!  Good referees get invited to be editors; good editors get invited to be good editors in chief.  A referee, editor, or editor in chief is a 'gatekeeper' and, thus, a somewhat powerful guy.  If the journal is good, the names are up in lights.  So, professional reputation is enhanced.  Professional connections are made.  In terms of HN, there are connections in a professional social graph.  A referee, editor, etc. gets to know who the up and comers are in their research field.  They get early notice of new research results and, then, can start working on extensions.  If they do a bad job, then their editor will soon not send them anymore papers to review!<p>""There's no doubt in that case that the journal has been an impediment to science.""  I don't see that.  Einstein published general relativity.  People are still trying to understand it, test it, and understand the implications.  So, at the time of publication, just how novel it was was not at all clear.  But it got published and passed the first step in the filter.  Slowly people understood that the paper was very important and worked hard on it.  The publication process didn't end the work on the paper but did its job.  I can't believe that many of the reviewers actually understood the Riemannian geometry.  Still the paper got published.  If the paper was actually nonsense, then that would be on Uncle Al.<p>I believe that the current system is okay.  The people objecting just want the system to be much more than it is; they may be asking for too much.  One way to improve is to quit chopping down trees, but that change is likely on the way.  But replacing the current system by putting papers on the Internet and letting nearly anyone 'vote' would be much worse.",1310738172

2767352,comment,2766060,2767136,2,0,lloeki,,,"<i>It is actually rather dull 2/3 years where you learn not so much about the material, but learn how to solve many exercices</i><p>That was absolutely not my case (but I know it has been the case for some in other cities). In my case the exercises, while numerous, were not that many, but were selected and crafted to push and bend the mind. The goal each time was to produce not someone who knows but someone who builds. The most striking example was one of my professors who had a habit of yelling <i>""Et l, c'est fini!""</i> (""And then, its over!""), halfway through a proof and sometimes as early as the second line, or even once having completed writing the first line, when the crux of the problem was to ask yourself the right question and express it the right way. This was a kind of recurring joke while at the same time the signal of the crux, the apex of the proof, where once you get past that point the rest is downhill freewheeling (although as with downhill driving, you should not get too carried away). It was the mark at which you could find the pattern, the point which defines the line (as in racing) that you will be able to build upon to come up with your own solutions.<p>In front of the blackboard, solving the exercise was never a goal in itself, but the path mattered just as much, if not more. It was common to actually not achieve an academic solution but demonstrating an ability to build an overarching path, though incomplete in its proof, that would lead to the solution would be rewarded. It was not uncommon either to solve the problem much quicker than expected, and the remainder of the kholle would be spend either enhancing the solution, finding an alternative solution, or extending the problem with a follow up or a generalization.<p>We were not meant to be dumb technical toolboxes (which the PGdG example is a perfect example) but brand new problem solvers. I would draw much parallels between those problem solving abilities and hacking solutions, refactoring arcs, encapsulating problems and caring about the bigger scope, to produce elegant and rewarding solutions.<p>Granted, this kind of teaching is not ubiquitous to every single <i>prpa</i> out there, but my point is that it cannot occur at all in a ""common denominator"" environment, where by design people that can keep up will have to look elsewhere by themselves to be challenged, whereas <i>prpa</i> or schools like Berkelee can act as a catalyst.",1310738108

2767343,comment,2766853,2767260,6,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Precisely.<p>Here's the difference: Replacing a customer is easier than replacing a client. If you build widget X, but then your customer decides they want Y instead, all you have to do is find one other customer in the world that wants X and you sell to them instead. Whereas in a consulting relationship you tend to have to throw X away and build Y, because hey, you're under contract and the client must be appeased.<p>(In theory you can write a contract stating that if you build X for a client and they refuse delivery you can repurpose X and sell it to a different client. In practice... consultant-built work product and an actual product are different in so many annoying little ways - assumptions about client's specific workflow and IP baked in, for example -- that this is never as easy as you think, and rarely easy enough to be worthwhile.)<p>Firing a customer is also easier than firing a client. They buy in little discrete chunks. Just apologize that your product no longer meets their needs and they won't buy the upgrade, or they'll cancel their subscription. In the absolute worst case you'll issue a refund. But compared to the soap-operatic stress-filled lawyeriffic delights of contract negotiation such events are almost a delight.",1310737938

You find one reliable person who you like working with, then you delegate increasing portions of the work to them.<p>For example, I had a pretty good working relationship with my ex-freelancer for BCC bingo card content, but let's pretend that I was serious about never spending my time on that again.  What I would do is a) grab all the docs I had written about the process, b) spit them into a Google doc document with headings like How To Find A New Freelancer, How To Make a CMS Account For A Freelancer, How To Pay Freelancers, Content Guidelines, etc and c) hand that off to the young lady in the Philippines who does utility VA stuff for me.  Then, I'd have her hire a new freelancer and do one week of work with them, with instructions to email me at each step for review.  I'd give feedback and update the docs where required.  After she was capable of doing it without needing my supervision, I'd tell her ""Great, it's yours now.  Make it work and send me an email once every two weeks with what you did, what you're doing next, and anything you need from me.  You have my email any time if there is a problem that you need an answer to.  If resolving the problem would cost less than $100, pay money to solve it and just tack it onto the next regularly scheduled email.  I trust your judgement.""<p>n.b. That $100 idea is flagrantly stolen from Tim Ferris.<p>As for normal: if I work with three people, I expect one or two to be Too Flakey To Use Successfully.  That's just a cost of doing business.  This suggests a) getting out of the talent identification business, since either I suck or it is impossible to do well and b) hanging on to good people for dear life.  I sent my BCC freelancer a Christmas bonus every year and thank you notes, and got ~3 years of mutually rewarding work out of her.<p>Regarding customer support: I do customer support myself.  <i>All</i> of my CEO friends are trying to get me to stop, principally because they are all tired of hearing ""Ooh ooh ooh guess what a customer just asked me about how I broke her blue Googles?""<p>If I were emotionally ready to stop, the first step would be writing a Google doc with instructions and four buckets of customer support inquiries, which represent ~80% of the emails I write.  Each bucket would have a template email to go with it.<p>The instructions would be ""Bucket the email and, if it is clearly in a bucket, reply with the template and $INSTRUCTION_FOR_MAIL_FILING.  If not, leave for me to deal with by $INSTRUCTION_FOR_MAIL_FILING.  If you're less than 90% sure, leave it for me.""<p>Then we'd iterate on that.  If they could handle bucketing, I'd move them up one step: here's my core principles for CS.  I always want to make them happy, a refund is always an option, we never do custom dev under any circumstances.  Here's four emails from customers which were not bucketed last month.  Write responses to them like you think I would have written responses, then send those responses to me.<p>Then I'd say ""OK, I like the content here, but I always start emails out with thanking the customer for emailing me.  This email here said 'If you hadn't clicked' -- that phrasing is not acceptable, because it implies customer fault, and the customer is never at fault for a failure of our software to anticipate their needs.  Otherwise, OK.""  Then I'd start them on live emails and review their progress.  After that: ""Congrats, you're now level 1 support.  $INSTRUCTIONS_TO_FORWARD if you're totally bewildered by an email.  Good luck.""<p>As you go forward, <i>document your processes</i>.  I cannot stress this enough.  That way, when your current support gets married, stops responding to emails, or informs you that she has taken a job at a multinational and will no longer be freelancing, you can quickly get the new person up to speed.  (Or, even better, your trusted lieutenant can quickly get the new person up to speed.)",1310737028

Still fundamentally, it's producing machine code and fundamentally it has a fairly limited runtime and compared to what a LISP coder thinks of when he thinks of closures you might not want to call what C++ has 'closures.'    Maybe the fact that the article referenced ""lambdas and closures"" is what throws me off...  that's two features, right? haha   The posts that mention C++'s cross platform nature also kind of make me laugh, it's sort of true,  it's also remarkably easy to make it not true, just using ""int"" somewhere will break it some cases and if one of your platforms in Visual C++, then you'll probably have 2 code bases #ifdefed in to one, you can make it work but you have to do some work.<p>C++ probably won't die, not exactly that languages just die.  Microsoft is all in with it, and many other organizations use it.   It seems like we are in an era where there is more freedom to match the tool to the job than ever before and I can't imagine starting a medium or large scale project in C++ when Java and .NET are both still very viable.  I can't imagine any serious C++ web app development,  I can easily see some Ruby, Python or something other calling a chunk of C++ code, but I just can't see it rendering javascript and html in any serious way,  it makes very little sense.  Now VMs, runtimes, browsers, they'll likely continue to have some C++ in them for some time.  It's a fine tool for some jobs.  I also find is puzzling,  the OpenJDK is GPL,  simply Oracle's ownership somehow suggests Java is ending?  If that's really what matters, then pretty clearly Go and Objective-C are what the future is, just looking at corporate ownership and momentum.<p>From a feature matrix?

That would be more moral as well.<p>Why?<p>> The reasons those with less money have trouble affording things is that they have been impoverished by government.<p>This (and the argument that follows) is very wrong, for at least the following reasons.<p>1. The fraction of the money a person receives and spends that gets taken in tax is smaller, not larger, for poorer people.<p>2. In particular, there are personal exemptions and deductions, which make up a substantial fraction of the salary of people with low incomes, and the lowest tax rate is 10% and not 15%. Many of your other numbers are also wrong, and curiously all in the same direction. Social security taxes are not 15% unless you include the payroll taxes that fund Medicare, in which case the Medicare rate is 0%, not 4%. (It wouldn't be 4% anyway; payroll taxes are 2.9%, including the portion paid by the employer.) 8% of 58% is not 8%. Your percentages are, to put it bluntly, bullshit.<p>3. If you are going to include the employer's social security contribution in the figure being taxed, you lose the right to say that what's being taxed is so-and-so-many percent ""of your income"". Because, y'know, it isn't.<p>4. The money paid to the government in taxes doesn't simply disappear into a hole. It is used to provide services. For instance, that Medicare payment pays (astonishingly enough) for Medicare. Which, if you happen not to be rich, you are likely to have need of one day. In a hypothetical world in which Big Bad Government didn't take all that money, those services would need to be provided privately, and they would cost money. Probably about the same amount of money as the government spends on them. If our hypothetical low-income person is going to avoid being ""impoverished"" by the government, presumably that means they simply don't get the use of those services. Sorry, Mr Low-Income Person, I know your house was burgled, but you haven't paid the private police and judicial services: no law enforcement for you! Oh, and your child was injured by a toy whose makers were recklessly indifferent to safety? Well, you should have paid for a safety audit yourself. Oh, you lost your job and are starving to death? You'd better find a private charitable organization that wants to help you, then: keeping you alive is no job for the state.<p>5. (This is more or less #1 from a different perspective.) The difference between poor and rich people, which explains why the poor people can't afford to make ends meet, is not that the government is taking the poor people's money and not the rich people's. The government is taking everyone's money (and doing useful things with it, see #4, but that's a separate issue). Imagine for a moment a world in which the money taken in taxes really <i>does</i> just get burned in a big incinerator. What happens? Answer: there's a large deflation rate, so presumably the currency needs re-denominating every now and then. Aside from that -- which would, yes, have bad effects because of the rapid change, but that's not relevant here -- everyone would in fact be about equally well off. Every year you'd lose half your money, and so would everyone else, so all the prices would have to halve to keep supply and demand in balance, so that half-your-money would be worth the same as it was before it was halved. Of course that's an oversimplification because in our hypothetical world income is being taxed but investment isn't. So the deflation rate would be a bit lower and the net effect would be a steady transfer from those with less capital to those with more. But in the real world, gains from investments are taxed just like gains from income are. If taxation is impoverishing the poor, the reason is the <i>difference</i> between the tax rate on income and the tax rate on capital gains, and you should be arguing for equalizing those, not for reducing taxes as such.",1310736316

2767259,comment,2766756,2767068,24,0,JunkDNA,,,"Your example is a good one, but as others point out, the computer has been designed logically. Biology hasn't been. And even then, there's just really oddball crap that comes out of left field. I'll give you a good example (which admittedly may require a few trips to wikipedia depending on your biology background):<p>The codon used for translating DNA/RNA code to protein is well established. It's a three-base degenerate code, meaning that there are several three-base DNA sequences representing a given amino acid [1]. This code is very well understood. If your DNA/RNA sequence has any of the three bases combos for alanine, your protein gets an alanine in that position. It follows from this that different DNA sequences can code for exactly the same amino acid sequence in a protein. However, proteins with the same amino acid sequence are chemically and biologicalally identical (ignoring things like post-translational modification).<p>A few years ago, I read a paper [2] where the group hypothesized that in a specific case, a rare codon for for an amino acid in a specific protein caused the cellular machinery to stall at that position. They suggested that in the intervening time, the protein misfolded into a different 3D shape. The resulting protein therefore had different chemical properties despite having identical amino acid sequence. Basically shredding what is often known as the ""central dogmal of molecular biology"".<p>Now, this specific example probably needs to be confirmed, and might not be very frequent. But it makes total sense when you understand how all the pieces work. However this explanation would be very low on most biologist's lists of reasons why a certain protein isn't functioning properly. In fact, when people do genetic analysis looking for diseases, they routinely throw out all synonymous changes before doing the stats. It makes you wonder how often we miss this when looking for disease genes.<p>My larger point is that lots of biological science is a collection of edge cases. We know so little about the systems we're studying and have such crude tools to investigate them, that we get blindsided by things sitting in plain sight all the time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/315/5811/525.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/315/5811/525.abstract</a>",1310736098

My point was, the numbers there had housing playing a major role in affecting your cost of living.  Simply put, if I wanted the same 4 bedroom, 2500 sqft house between here and San Francisco, it's going to cost me a LOT more.  However, if I ignore the housing, the rest of the estimates are still useful, and as a result, you can still find out how much more or less you need to make to maintain what you are used to.<p>> That's what that calculator does, and it's deceptive and wrong.<p>If you look at the numbers blindly, sure.  But their is value in knowing the comparative values in things besides housing.  After all, it's not just giving you one single number.<p>My argument isn't that the calculator is completely right, only that it's not completely useless as you make it out to be.<p>Finally, you also talk a lot about other factors.  While it's true, it's also pointless.  Of course people aren't going to just look at the calculator and base everything off that.  However, for many people, it's a helpful indication of what to expect.  A 20% increase across the board for all expenses could mean someone moving for a job for a small pay raise might need to plan accordingly.<p>Basically, knowing how much things cost relative to where you are now is important.  Yes, the more money you make, the less it matters, but there are far fewer people in that situation.",1310736064

I've observed with events prior to this that anyone can start one of these public trials by posting an accusation publicly. Then that opening statement is responded to by the defendant, also publicly. At which point its 'game on' as it were.<p>I suspect it is a natural consequence of the desire to know by the folks involved, whether its poor EJ here or 'geohot' or Charlie Sheen. Everyone wants to know ""what is right?"" or ""what is the <i>real</i> story here?"" and that process that people go through and the community that participates in it, has all of the elements of a trial. Evidence is uncovered and presented, testimony is called for and presented from various people involved, pundits line up to endorse or discredit evidence and/or folks testimonies.<p>So there are a lot of questions. Clearly there is a lot of outrage here and elsewhere. Hopefully it will be sorted out to everyone's satisfaction, and it certainly will provide a test of AirBnB's management team.<p>Like many here, I share the outrage and the commensurate desire to help. I recognize that being effectively outside the event horizon (wasn't a witness, not a personal friend, not an investor, not a freelance plaintiff lawyer, etc etc) I'm limited to offering moral support.",1312048764
2826252,comment,2825957,2826230,4,0,nirvdrum,,,"Okay, so she wasn't victimized by AirBnB.  The Craigslist Killer also didn't work for Craigslist.  I don't think anyone reading the headlines, story, or comments really are misinterpreting what's being said.  But it's disingenuous to completely remove AirBnB from the discussion, too.  If nothing else, it was a catalyst of sorts.  I don't find two blog posts spaced out over a month to be ridiculous and appreciate the caveat she's offering others by doing so.  More than that I'm enjoying the honest discussion around security considerations of renting out your home.  If it spurs AirBnB to make things safer for its clientele, all the better.",1312048736

2826249,comment,2825957,2826230,4,0,Vivtek,,,"Well, the reason this is not as simple as you would like is this: clearly, the original incident was not AirBnB's fault; it was a crime that happened in the same context as any other rental or lease situation, and (as I've posted in volume elsewhere) it happens.  I've had tenants, so I empathize with her immensely, but it's still not even close to AirBnB's fault.<p>So insofar as the original incident is concerned, you're not wrong.  She wasn't victimized by AirBnB.<p>And in fact initially AirBnB reacted quite admirably - until she posted in public.  <i>Then AirBnB stopped reacting admirably.</i><p>There have been some rationalizations for the fact that all contact with the company ceased except for some apparent invitation for a coffee, there's been a request and no doubt a fervent desire on AirBnB's part that this not be quite so public, or at least if public, not quite so eloquent - so you tell me.  When a company cuts off contact with you because you endanger their funding, then lies about it in the industry press, is that victimization?  I don't know - but neither do you.  Which is why I said it's a tougher question.<p>Also, I'd really like to differ with you rather vehemently with your oblique assertion that the Internet should be seen as a ""substitute"" for a real community. Where do you think you just posted?",1312048690

I was doing C# and WPF dev right out of Uni and really loved the total power that you were given to create cutting edge apps (I worked primarily with the Microsoft Surface).<p>I don't really have anything bad to say about WPF but when I first got my hands on UIKit and Objective-C I fell in love.<p>In WPF you can do anything and customize everything. UIKit is Apple's magical black box but it will get you like 80-90% of the way to your goal so you don't need to engineer everything like I did with WPF. Couple that with Foundation and their other great frameworks like CoreLocation and so much boilerplate code seems to be hidden behind Apple's walls.<p>I'm also probably in the minority but I like the verboseness of Objective-C and the dynamic nature of it. Honestly it is a small thing but not having to put null pointer checks all over my code is the thing about the language I love the most.",1312048640

It won't always be the obvious thing like jewelry (and why would you leave that actually) it could be one of many little things you don't realize you have until missing. Or something could be broken.<p>The fact is there is no way for airbnb to insure against any number of minor type things that could happen. Where minor becomes your problem and your aggravation.<p>Have you ever seen how big of an industry shoplifting prevention is? Do you really think that only a minor % of the population commits petty type crimes?<p>And there is the reverse situation.<p>If you stay at someones place what if they honestly think that you stole something of theirs because they can't find it?

Android's app rankings, in particular, seem to be tuned to give an advantage to new apps, so apps that get good ratings and a bunch of downloads out of the gate can potentially place.<p>Once an app is a month or two old, even if it's well rated and doing decent, it can crash in the rankings and get buried under thousands of other apps, even if it has a lot of enthusiastic fans.

In fact, a common factor across the clients I would consider to be rude is that they tend to use up disproportionate amounts of my time! It's perfectly possible to be brief, concise, and still make room for manners, and I appreciate anyone that does so.<p>The clients I love most are the ones are considerate, and I think the rest of their behaviour comes from that: Communicating clearly and concisely, yet remaining polite, and valuing my time as well as theirs, are all things I think follow from being considerate.<p>I think it's hard to argue that demanding everyone do things your way is considerate. To use your analogy, no, I don't expect the chef to argue with my choice. But if I order a particular cut one way, and the waiter comes back saying ""Sir, the Chef highly recommends you instead have that particular cut with the such-and-such sauce"" for example, then I might take that on board. And I might not. But to sit down at the table and state up-front that I want to hear no talking back from the chef before I place my order would certainly be rude, and possibly result in me having a lower quality meal due to my poor choice of sauce (and perhaps having another ""sauce"" added due to my loose tongue).<p>Edit: There is some validity to using one-size-fits-all approaches particularly in some management situations I suppose (not so experienced in that area), but personally if I could decrease effeciency a little in order to remain polite, I would do so. I suspect a lot of the polarisation on the topic is due to this, as there's no real ""right answer"" there.",1312047854

She was booked into San Francisco County Jail on possession of stolen property, methamphetamine, fraud charges and an outstanding warrant in Milpitas.<p>They also detained two individuals in Belmont earlier that day, but released them pending further investigation.

Programming requires patience and the ability to handle detail. Women are naturals at computer programming.<p>What shes talking about is <i>apititude</i>the one most important quality a girl needs to become a programmer. She also needs a keen, logical mind.

Most things, like displaying dialogs, storing things to the Db, etc. worked quite well and I really came to like intents. However, I completely agree with the authors criticism of the implementation of asynchronous calls. We implemented in app purchase functionality for our app and it was a huge pain. Google provides lots of documentation around this. However it's very convoluted and looking at their example IAP app makes you wonder if they had some contest going on to achieve the highest number Gang of 4 design patterns per lines of code. That massively distracted from what the example was supposed to teach you. We ended up spending around 2 weeks to get a solidly tested implementation of IAP working and get all edge cases covered. My main complaint about this is, that we weren't doing anything fancy and 99% of the code we had to write was not specific to our application. Something that just takes our vendor information and one callback for the success case and one for the error case would have totally done the job. I am sure there are hundreds of dev teams out there writing the exact same code as we did. Many of those probably are not testing their code or even just copying Google's example, without understanding what's going on. This is a huge waste of everyone's resources and will probably lead to many buggy apps.
I understand that Google wants to allow for the flexibility to cover 99.9% of all use cases. However, they could still have offered a simple library method for the 99% case and have allowed the other 1% to write their own thing. Now everyone has to write their own solution.
I hope someone will open source their IAP solution. If not, I actually might do it, since it's just crazy right now.",1312045742

But what you did, and what the coffee-drinking co-founder reportedly did (from EJ's perspective), make a very strong case for the importance of a competent PR person.<p>Quite simply, that competent PR person is the overseer of what has been said so far by the company, by the plaintiff, by the lawyers, and by the media. He or she, ideally, when queried by any of these parties, will answer such queries honestly with what he knows has been previously stated and/or promised by the other party, or will say ""I don't know that, let me ask [x,y,z] and I will get back to you.""<p>I understand how that's not a good enough decisive answer for anyone here, but that's the limits of human communication when dozens of stakeholders are involved. Some things are delayed because due diligence <i>requires</i> it...such is the complexity of life.<p>So who knows what really went on in the mind of the co-founder when he asked EJ to coffee. But according to her, we might assume that he himself assumed that EJ was properly comforted enough to send her a get-down-to-business email. She apparently was not. How could such a drastic misunderstanding happen when a co-founder, in your perfect world, is ostensibly the end-all point of proper decision and action?<p>To compound the problem, Brian Chesky writes the prototypical PR statement that looks downright shady in retrospect after EJ swiftly responds with a dramatic blog post that also accuses someone at airbnb of attempting to silence her blog.<p>Let's give Chesky the benefit of the doubt that he didn't know or condone such a request. Well, some well-intended white (from the investors' perspective) or black (from many other people's perspective) knight from airbnb apparently did so.<p>On top of all of that, EJ accuses airbnb of cold shouldering her until the blog blowup at HN. Hell, I don't remember the exact timeline, but I doubt even most of the avid participants in this thread do...certainly none of the newcomers won't bother sketching out a flowchart for themselves.<p>Boy, having one competent person be the sole point of contact -- even just a smooth-talking PR underling --  sure sounds good right now. Even if we give the co-founders the benefit of the doubt of being as upfront and willing to help as possible, the apparent innocent miscommunications have made many people, including MA, very jaded.<p>And now you've thrown yourself into the mix, in the belief that this is all caused by the immature incompetent behavior of the airbnb executive team (boy, that's a great message to future airbnb investors) and failed PR...don't you think it's a wee bit ironic to make your ""I-tracked-her-down-and-gave-her-info-to-PG-because-I-can't-see-PG-screwing-this-up"" comment in a HN thread based on a TechCrunch post in which a self-professed fan of airbnb accuses PG of outright lying?<p>If providing fodder for another top-voted HN thread that accuses airbnb of a coverup isn't a screw-up, then, well...<p>In any case, you might be a well-intentioned, smart developer and entrepreneur. But you've made mistakes that I hope even an undergrad in communications wouldn't have.

Having said that, a lot more work is purely short-term so having gaps is not the black mark that it used to be.",1312045315

I enjoy insulting people who don't believe in climate change as much as anyone, but never in the context of trying to present my research (note that you claim that your first paragraph is the result of your research) and never on HN, since it adds nothing to the conversation and weakens arguments. Complaining about being downvoted and insulting anyone who downvotes you also tends to be a good way to get downvoted - adds nothing to the conversation, doesn't make people think that you're a level-headed person they should listen to.<p>EDIT: And your comment is now in the positive. Which lets me point out that a really standard pattern on HN is for comments to be downvoted before being upvoted - since the first people who get to comments tend to be those who blindly downvote anything they dislike, and are then followed by the ones who actually look at comments. Complaining and freaking out about it can only make it worse.",1312045232

Cocoa programming requires a lot of up front knowledge about their design patterns and tools. It's no small undertaking for someone to learn about KVO, delegate pattern (so simple but confuses people for some reason, I think it's the name), MVC, and then add actions and outlets, resizing masks, and all the other unique things to Xcode/IB that people have to learn.<p>Once you know Cocoa and Xcode iOS development is faster and more fun than Android development but it's no small learning curve. It's worth it for the fast turnaround of using the simulator compared to Android where both the emulator and device are slow, you're looking at 5-10x as long to launch your app compared to the iOS simulator. Plus ObjC > Java if you ask me, but I'm a masochist who likes both C and dynamic languages. Individual statements are verbose in Cocoa but I'd have to look at how much boilerplate is caused by the Java straight jacket to speculate on which is ultimately more verbose.<p>You also have to be willing to put with some crusty stuff. Nothing compared to OS X programming but it still feels old next to Java's APIs. Two good examples are string manipulation and interacting w/ the filesystem, so verbose on iOS but pretty good in Java.",1312045219

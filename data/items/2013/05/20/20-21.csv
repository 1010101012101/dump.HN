Focus on the the weird events, the house parties, all that stuff that's off the beaten path. Create a slot functionality so people can allow half-strangers (friends of friends of friends) to sign up for a slot, then the hosts can check before accepting or something. Also allow blind-accept events. The accepted/blind-accepted people are then given the address. I don't know, something like that. I think it could quite work out.

I don't quite disapprove of these articles, but I agree once you see the pattern it is rather ubiquitous.<p>Where I am with these at the moment is questioning whether the person would have written it anyway and is tagging their business into it (reasonable) or writing something specifically to increase their visibility (I'm more skeptical).<p>Occasionally I imagine such a writer sitting at their desk with ""the big book of business basics"" saying ""which one shall I write up <i>today</i> and post to HN to obliquely promote my product?"".

Let's say it is now 2005, you have a $1,000,000. You follow cpursley's advice, and put it in a well managed ETF/mutual fund, expecting to get 8%-12%. You get that for the first year and second year - and then you get -50% (which, if you look at your starting sum is ""just"" -40%). Now, you need 8 good years just to go back to where you started.<p>2005 is unfair? Go back to 1999, and check yourself at the end of 2001.<p>1999 is unfair? Go back to 1986.<p>My point being, the ""common knowledge"" 150 years long term average of 7%/year is irrelevant, for two reasons:<p>a) market dynamics have changed significantly in the last 10 years or so; the 140 years before that aren't as informative as the last 10 - and the last 10 are abysmal.<p>b) even if the 150 year statistics were relevant - what you care about is your 10-30 year horizon. There are just too many unlucky events during those 150 years that you are very likely to have a 30-50% loss in one of the years of your 10-30 year horizon -- which might take you 50 years (that you don't have) to average out and come out on top.<p>Anyone who really believes the 8%-12% numbers can borrow at <6%, invest at >8%, leverage ad absurdum and basically print money. Which, incidentally, is the empirical proof that 8% is not attainable.<p>(P.S - CALPERS assumed a modest 8% return. That's why they're now only 50% or so funded <a href=""http://www.calwatchdog.com/2012/03/22/calpers-funding-might-be-only-40-percent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calwatchdog.com/2012/03/22/calpers-funding-might-...</a> .

Second, auto repair, like most skilled trades, is a great example where specialization of workers gets involved.

It was just passed down as folk wisdom -- ""never make the network transparent, it cannot be done easily"" and never quite knew where that came from.<p>I remember asking a senior developer about RPC after seeing a a bunch of RPC daemons on a Sun machine, and he said, it is some really complicated stuff that you don't really want to know about and unless you absolutely need to use it. I was just a young intern then.<p>But there are a whole bunch of technologies from that time that try to abstract the network away (I can think of NFS, or I guess pretty much any remote storage that makes itself appear as a local file system).<p>Then I've seen RPC API philosophies that take 2 sides. Some magically proxy method calls and marshal data between object, others want users to always marshal by hand and send via the sockets.<p>> You have to be able to know exactly what the lowermost piece of the puzzle is going to do before you can reason about what pieces that depend on that may or may not do.<p>So it is possible to abstract any of that away? Maybe it is not a horizontal abstraction as in ""hide the network away"", but maybe a vertical abstraction, as in the creating socket-like objects that have extra features (like ZeroMQ). Connecting, sending, receiving is still there, but there is extra helping on top at each step.<p>On another side note. I think network topologies and characteristics changed. It used to be that creating consistent distributed systems was easiest even though networks speed were slower. Networks were more likely to be local in a data center. So chance of a network split was much lower. (And I've learned there are fewer more evil things in a general distributed system than a network split). Today's distributed systems are more likely so experience network splits (multi-zone, multi-datacenter clusters I guess are more common + unpredictability added  by using VMs). So maybe paradoxically distributed system really got harder not easier.",1369082270

Offerings that make use of the Rule 505 or Rule 506 exemptions instead, however, are limited to 35 non-accredited investors (the language of the exemption requirement, in both cases, ""There are no more than <i>or the issuer reasonably believes that there are no more than</i> 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer in any offering under this section""; in both cases, accredited investors, and certain other special classes, are excluded from the count of purchasers.)<p>> If they engage in general solicitations, then the bar is higher for ascertaining this.<p>Well, we don't know precisely because the rule required under the JOBS Act <i>permitting</i> general solicitation under the Rule 506 exemption haven't been written, but it would seem likely to be so once that is permitted. But the Act itself provides that the elimination of the general solicitation prohibition requires that ""all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors"", and that the ""rules shall require the issuer to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using such methods as determined by the Commission."" This would appear to require a higher bar than the simple ""reasonable belief"" test in the current exemptions.<p>> If I wanted to message all my users and tell them to point their investor friends towards our AngelList profile, wouldn't that be public solicitation?<p>I suspect so (but I'm not an expert in the application of these regulations): you aren't soliciting investment directly from just the identified users, you are asking them to solicit on your behalf from a vaguely defined group (""investor friends"".)<p>I would suspect that an offering made <i>only</i> to your existing users would not be general solicitation.",1369081766

I also get that this particular comment you're singling out <i>might</i> be an example of it, but I'm not sure. However, I'm not convinced that every instance that looks like the alleged problem is really a problem in itself and, perhaps I am in a minority, do not believe this sort of thing is the downfall of HN.<p>For me, I think the issues that make discussions go ""downhill"" are less to do with criticism and much more to do with prevalence of group-think. I don't think the prevailing wisdom that pointing out fundamental errors of facts of faulty arguments is a bad thing, even if they are not the main point of the article. I think there is edifying value in such criticism. Now, it is true that an article may have value beyond it's minor or major inherent fallacies and errors. Criticism is not censorship and it does not prevent others from reading and discussing other parts of an article if they are interesting and fodder for good conversation. Nevertheless, I don't think being overly generous or charitable necessarily the best method or should be enforced via an algorithm or community brow beating. No one wants inane Reddit conversations but I don't think most want sterile group-think or hug sessions either.<p>HN has all kinds of users with different backgrounds and some users are very knowledgeable and critical and we can learn a lot of have great discussion regarding the criticism as the more traditionally positive style conversations. If we eliminated this sort of discussion from HN, I think it would make things much worse than better, Valley group-think would rule the day. One thing I think users that come to HN expect is good information either in the articles or to find the proper information in the comments. If we let erroneous information stand because of we want to be nice or follow Atwood's ""ruthlessly civil"" or whatever the hell his ideology is, I think we would less a great benefit of HN discussions and users, particularly less experienced ones, would be worse off. If I'm new, and I see an HN submission that says eBay and Netflix are startups and that clearly is a significant part of the article and as well there are many comments on HN, but with no contention of that issue anywhere to be found, I may well think that the community consensus is that eBay is a startup.<p>On other articles that get submitted, I may conclude that the smart people on HN think all manner of pseudoscience and homeopathy are generally accepted, if I wasn't aware of there being new a impetus to avoid criticism.<p>I personally don't want what is suggested by this random author:\n<a href=""http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2013/03/mrs-feynmans-advice-on-programming-language-popularity-contests.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2013/03/mrs-feynmans-advic...</a><p>>Is your problem that the hearty self congratulation mutual admiration society on Hacker News (now there's a middlebrow dismissal!) thinks that something you like isn't as new and shiny as something you don't care about?<p>(oddly enough I think that article is relevant to the original topic)\nI think that comment is somewhat unfair to HN but if we are not careful and are to act to hastily toward criticism we may just end up with a ""mutual admiration society.""

For starters, I think both left- and right-libertarians, as well as most journalists, would disagree with you. I would also guess that society in general would be outraged if a journalist was jailed for that particular offense, so what you claim is clearly not universally true.<p>I also disagree that this person is a reasonable suspect, any more than the pizza restaurant, who probably either gave it to a customer as change, used it to pay a vendor, or deposited it.<p>Although the orwellian term ""justice system"" is undoubtedly convenient for such an argument, I'm going to suggest thhat your statement be read with a substitution of ""legal framework"" in its place.

The answer is unequivocally no, justice was not served.<p>Edit: It also seems like you're conflating refusing to testify with being an accessory. Your claim was the latter, which is much more serious than contempt of court.

Nothing wrong with spending a little extra of course, but this seems off.<p>I looked at the wiki articles and I'm not seeing the 1.4 million spec.  Are you sure you didn't make an arithmetic error and calculate 25 kids instead of 2.5 kids?  I'd need psychological counseling to handle 25 kids.  I never thought schoolteachers earned their pay until I had kids of my own.<p>The wikipedia tables don't make much sense to me.  I'm in the 2 kids and dual parent and somewhat into the ""More than $102,870"" category (though not too far into it) and I have about a decade of experience budgeting for the kids and I'm mystified how I am supposedly spending $6K every year transporting my kids.   That would be like 1500 gallons of gas or 67500 miles per year?  My wife bought a relatively loaded Prius in '05 and its getting a bit worn out after 8 years of extremely heavy use so that superficially seems expensive, but she traded in a fast little 2-door and would presumably have dropped the same cash on an equally expensive, yet smaller/faster car if we didn't have kids.  So the cost of transport is the extra gas she burns going to daycare?  Or little league?  Its just not that much.  The food estimate seems about right, we eat very well, it is probably about $2K/month maybe $3K/month for the whole family.  Clothing cost is more like zero for little kids, assuming you have Grandma and Auntie in the area.  Grandma especially seems to feel unable to visit without some kind of textile product in hand.  When the teen years hit and its not cool to wear something grannie picked out, I'm sure that cost will rise from current basically $0.  The housing cost is fairly mystifying as it in no way approaches the cost of paying for the house, then again without kids we'd just have a fancier apartment for the same money so much like the car, the cost of kids is zero.  Health is a bit high as we have a household deductible, unless they're counting bandaids or something, I believe its exactly $1500/x where x is the number of family members, I guess.  Child care is absolutely ridiculous, its more like $10K until grade school and then it drops to practically nothing maybe $3K to cover summers and camp and stuff.  Misc is hilarous $2K total per year yeah maybe for just the ITMS or cable TV or something LOL.  That's probably more like $10K per kid.<p>Anyway thats my experience of the hilarious wikipedia table based on a decade of actual experience budgeting.",1369080562

Sure, you have to explicitly turn them on in your file, but that's trivial. In practice, it's really no different from importing a library.<p>At the very least, the GADT approach is not <i>hard</i> in Haskell. I don't see how it's any more difficult than the Scala approach. If anything, it's <i>more</i> natural: this is exactly the sort of use case GADTs were designed for.<p>The main advantage of using GADTs here is that they're simple and explicit. Sure, you could do the same thing with case classes, but it would be more awkward, and you'd really be rebuilding part of the same functionality yourself.<p>You don't really have to use data kinds in my example, but it makes the code nicer because you explicitly limit the types you can use as flags to 'Checked and 'Unchecked. You could have just made Checked and Unchecked empty types and stayed with normal kinds; the data kind approach is simply more elegant.<p>The GADT method also ensures that the pattern matching is always safe. It also preserves exhaustiveness checking, which is very nice. I'm not sure if the Scala approach can do this.<p>Another advantage over using witness objects (assuming I understood your idea correctly) is that you do not introduce anything new at the value level. 'Checked and 'Unchecked are only ever types, so the actual AST ends up being exactly the same as before just with a different type. I think this is a boon to clarity and simplicity. It also means that the use-site of the AST type doesn't change very much, if at all.<p>Really, the main idea is that this is very easy in Haskell, basically using a single simple abstraction: the GADT. Just being hidden behind a language extension does not magically make the concept any more complicated or difficult to use!<p>As an aside, if you want polymorphic variants, I don't see any reason not to use OCaml. It's a very nice language, and gets sub-typing <i>right</i>. All without sacrificing type inference.",1369080266

I don&#x27;t see how today&#x27;s feature is worse.<p>Now, I see the opposite of what you see.  Because my gmail address consist of just my name, and my name is common, I _already_ get loads and loads of mail destined for other people with my name.  I find this annoying and I have no way to stop it.  With this new feature, at least people who are using Gmail to compose their message will have a better chance of finding the right person, because the contacts in the composer show the profile picture from Google+.  That means I will get less of this mail.  It also means that the mail I do get will go to the &quot;Social&quot; tab of my Gmail inbox, which I don&#x27;t even display by default, so it will be out of my face entirely.  And, finally, I have a way to retaliate, because deleting their messages means those misguided people can never contact me via Google+ again.  Nice.<p>As for your other points I don&#x27;t think they are even worth addressing.  You aren&#x27;t seriously proposing that Google should maintain separate account systems for Gmail, Google search, Google maps, Google+, Youtube, Docs and Drive, and every other product, are you?  Can&#x27;t you imaging the password maintenance/hijacking/support nightmare that would ensue?",1389326317

7035024,comment,7032394,7034155,1,0,brc,,,"Well, no.<p>Inflation; it strangles an economy for obvious reasons that require nothing more than understanding the inevitable consequences of endless increasing the supply of your medium of exchange. Printing money is what keeps prices rising forever as the population and economy grows. If you endlessly print more money, you&#x27;d be forced into inflation; you think people like the value of their labor constantly reduced? Do vendors like rising prices across the board not because things are more expensive to produce, but because the value of money has fallen? How do make long term contracts when the value of your money isn&#x27;t stable? How do you get a 30 year mortgage or rent a place when no one knows what the currency will be worth tomorrow? That&#x27;s why fiat currencies always fail.<p>Inflation/Deflation are both effects - the difference is that it is impossible to reduce the prices of things to zero, but it is possible [and has been done, many times] to increase prices to infinity.",1389326240

There are winners and there are losers.  There is no record of a country falling into a destructive deflationary spiral (really, can anything get destroyed by lower prices?), but there is a long laundry list of countries and empires destroyed by inflation, starting with the roman empire and currently displayed by Zimbabwe.<p>Some people will say a stronger currency (as compared with other currencies) is a good thing.  Some people will say a weaker curency is a good thing.  Neither is right.  Inflation and Deflation are the same - both have effects - both create winners and losers.

7035000,comment,7032040,7032370,2,0,ampersandy,,,"I helped build the server-side component of this framework during my first internship at Facebook. The framework is server driven, in that experiments are defined in another tool and then loaded on the client framework. Essentially, an experiment is parameterized by name and a user&#x27;s ID. The server code then determines which experimental condition the user should be placed into, and it returns the values of the parameters corresponding to that condition.<p>The framework was initially designed for the web, in an effort to make a simple framework for running experiments with parameterized text content. Copy needs to be translated to launch on Facebook, as many people use the site in non-English languages. The framework integrates with several other internal tools to make running experiments with text a lot easier - mainly, the translation services and Gatekeeper for targeting specific countries, languages, etc..[0] The framework is also dead-simple for running experiments with other scalar parameters - as an example, testing the number of results returned from a search.<p>I&#x27;m sure you could write a framework that exists solely client-side, but then you also have to re-write all of the experiment logic for each platform, rather than the &#x27;wrapper&#x27; required to sync server-side and handle edge-cases like delayed exposure, etc. The wrapper is already non-trivial, so it&#x27;s also nice that you can ensure the core framework is well tested without having to worry about testing in different environments. As I said before, integrating with other services is also really great, and for Facebook, most services are in PHP or exposed through Thrift, so accessing them on the server is very straightforward.<p>Another upside to being server driven is that updating an experiment can happen on the fly, so the moment you determine your experiment&#x27;s best variant, you can disable the other ones without waiting for Apple to review the app again, etc. I&#x27;m sure you could implement this with a client framework, but it seems less elegant if you are relying on the server for key information about the status of the experiment, but still trying to retain all the experiment logic on the client.<p>0: <a href""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-and-testing-at-facebook/1015100415732892"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building...</a>",1389325840

Let&#x27;s try it without the cursing, shall we?<p>Google has taken a collection of services that are not functionally related -- a search engine, a mapping engine, a hosted mail service, a social network, a video sharing site, a web-based document editing system with cloud storage, and more -- and made the following unilateral decisions:<p>(1) The default is to have one Google account that links you to all services.\n(2) You are strongly encouraged to use your real name for that account.\n(3) The default for linking services together is opt-out rather than opt-in.<p>Google puts a lot of effort into making you have <i>one account across all of Google.</i> The signal difference between them and, well, everyone else (with the possible exception of Facebook) is that it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to <i>not</i> be part of the Google ecosystem. Yes, the median HN reader can come up with a laundry list of other services to replace everything Google, but most users can&#x27;t and even most technically competent users probably aren&#x27;t going to.<p>The upshot of the three principles above is that in practice, anyone with a Google Account -- which is at this point probably a substantial percentage of the world population -- has a very good chance of being able to send email to you if they have no other information but your real name.<p>Is that the end of privacy as we know it? Of course not. But do you really, <i>really</i> think that only crazy weirdo Apple users would possibly find it just a touch troubling that Google thinks it&#x27;s okay for this to be the default? Do you really think it&#x27;s insane for me to think that Google should perhaps consider that their users might deserve privacy from both other Google users and Google itself, as opposed to just the &quot;privacy&quot; granted by better spam blocking algorithms and SSL?",1389325770
7034993,comment,7030097,7032083,1,0,Goladus,,,"<i>The editor cannot know how to indent that properly. It&#x27;s not a problem in most other languages.</i><p>It will have a pretty good idea.  If you paste the snippet, then hit &#x27;tab&#x27;, odds are high that a good editor (I use emacs python-mode) will Do The Right Thing on the first try, although sometimes you&#x27;ll have to hit tab again or backspace a couple of times to get the right indent level.<p>Occasionally I need to use a keyboard macro to fix the indent after a paste, but this is very easy to do and doesn&#x27;t happen to often, really.  I&#x27;m sure by now with python&#x27;s popularity there are more advanced indentation management tools but I still just use emacs keyboard macros.<p>It&#x27;s a very small price to pay for the huge benefits of semantic whitespace.<p>Generally the worst case scenario for copy/paste is that I&#x27;m using emacs in a terminal window and I forget to switch to fundamental-mode before pasting.  Because the terminal is handling the paste, not emacs, python-mode treats it all as if it had been entered one line at a time and auto-indents everything after a colon, then pasting in lines that already have indentation and the result is a complete mess.  (but then I just undo it all and re-paste it the right way)  GUI emacs doesn&#x27;t have this problem.<p>The worst case scenario I can think of for semantic whitespace (outside of copy/paste) is accidentally changing indent level of a piece of code without realizing it and a syntax error doesn&#x27;t result, meaning there&#x27;s now a logic flaw in your program you don&#x27;t know about.  Python is more susceptible to that than sort of regression error than most languages.  That said, usually that sort of mistake WILL cause a syntax error and be easily fixed.",1389325750

The whitespace saves keystrokes and errors because it&#x27;s giving a semantic meaning to something that programmers put in their code anyway.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve actually written some code in ruby, I can&#x27;t comprehend how rubyists aren&#x27;t driven insane by the &#x27;end&#x27; tokens.  I&#x27;m sure this is a newbie mistake but on multiple occasions I&#x27;ve written something like this:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x)\n      if x > 5\n        puts x\n      else\n        puts 5\n    end\n\n    foo(7)\n    foo(3)\n</code></pre>\nAny experienced ruby programmers should see the error pretty quickly.  But it LOOKS pretty good.   Here is the error you get:<p><pre><code>    test.rb:9: syntax error, unexpected $end, expecting kEND\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s on line 9?  That&#x27;s just the end of the file.  Nowhere near where the syntax error actually is.  In this trivial example, tab-checking the indentation using my editor will reveal the error.  But this is a trivial example.  In more substantial code this technique is not nearly as effective.  In erb templates its harder still.<p>That never happened to me in python, even as a newbie.  If I forget a colon I almost always know instantly because the editor will try to indent my code dramatically wrong.  And if I inadvertently delete the colon at a later time without updating the indentation (this happens a lot) I get an instant syntax error that points me right at the line where the colon is missing.  It&#x27;s an error you can fix in your sleep.  You don&#x27;t forget end tokens because there are no end tokens to forget.  The block ends when the indentation level decreases.",1389324795

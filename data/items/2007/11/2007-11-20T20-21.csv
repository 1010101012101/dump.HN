They waited for a digital product that didn't suck.<p>Paper book readers are still waiting. It's been a long wait, and the end is not yet in sight. From what I've read so far, the Quicktake was better at being a camera than the Kindle is at being a book: You had the option to photograph whatever you wanted, you weren't charged by the frame, you didn't need to read an FAQ in order to figure out how to press the shutter release, your pictures weren't invisibly sent to a corporate database to be mined for data, and the cameras presumably continue to work even though the bureaucracy that spawned them has long since lost interest in them.<p>",1195592331

82117,comment,81976,82055,0,0,tx,,,"Depends on how you look at it. Windows Server 2003 is not a bad server OS and properly written and deployed ASP.NET application will be able to handle <i>TONS</i> of requests. Two reasons: native code execution (.NET caches compiled code in memory) and very efficient threading. This thought may be unpopular but it does not make it less true.<p>However, as a struggling one-two person startup, you probably will not want to pay crazy prices for dedicated windows hosting (Win2003 server+MSSQL). And shared Windows hosting is <i>always</i> crap: overloaded servers, terrible performance, etc.<p>Basically, Windows platform is not very startup-friendly: you develop slower (thus will take you longer, i.e. you'll bleed more money) and later it will cost you more to host your app. Besides, a proper set of Visual Studio + MSDN subscription is not exactly cheap.<p>For well-funded startups .NET makes more economic sense: easier to hire for and performs/scales well (myspace).

82116,comment,81976,82115,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've had a lot of bad experiece with Code Generation as well.<p>
What I think I see happening over the past few years is a lot of authors and researchers developing code generation templates as part of their work. So instead of the guy who's got the book telling you to make 7-tier, multi-phasic, distributed apps, you got the guy, a website, a following, and a set of templates and wizards that make this thing for you.<p>
I'm not crazy about that at all, but I think it is having the effect of evolving the code generation community. I'm seeing a lot more people who want to ""program the programming"" Most, of course, create monsters. But it only takes one good set of easily-used and rock-solid templates to create real value for everybody. So in the old days, there was 5-10 CASE tools and they all sucked, now there's more like 500 template authors, and 10-15 are pretty good. In my opinion, that's a good trend, but the genre of ""code generation"" still has a well-deserved negative connotation.",1195590257

I do agree that having some sort of code generation does have a place, and can be useful.  But it is also has it's problems, especially related to maintainability.  Lastly, the last time I looked at some code generation, there was so much custom junk built on top of the generated code, it was like they were using a round peg for a square hole.<p>Obviously, I am biased by what I have seen in practice.  I also dislike a lot of 'magic', or things I don't understand and have control over being tightly integrated with my code.

82113,comment,82068,82093,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""There's a wide gap between where ASP.NET's usefulness ends and where the really fancy stuff begins."" -- yes. This is the frustration of ASP.NET programming _without_ the underlying HTML/JS/CSS/XML knowledge. It's like you can almost do everything you want, but not quite. The grid control, as you mention, does some totally sweet stuff right out of the box. But want subtotals? Time to learn about the IIS HTTP Pipeline.<p>
It all boils down to what you are doing. Lots of shops can have 3 or 4 coders doing the mainline stuff and 1 guy who can do the tricky stuff. It's an effective use of lower-skilled programming resources.<p>
I'd have to disagree with you on the libraries. While I'm sure there are some good libraries out there, when I'm plugged into VS I've got some kazillion or so things I can do without having to Google, link, recompile, or do squat. And I can easily make libraries to share with others. It depends on your needs. Since MS does a little bit of everything for everybody, the libraries are probably the broadest that are easily available.",1195589767

I liked it better with the forumlas. (grin) Seriously -- that's a good point. But I don't think it is language-dependent. Might be. I don't know. From what I've seen languages and platforms are just new and interesting ways for programmers to shoot themselves in the foot. Good programming remains the same now as it was decades ago.

82103,comment,81976,82090,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm hoping I'm not getting into a flame war -- not my intent.<p>
Here's the problem with what you said -- the word ""code"". It's not defined. In any kind of large environment, my application uses all kinds of compiled code. So what if I push a button or flick a switch to use another hunk of code that I don't have to write or test? Is using System.Io somehow ""better"" than say, having an automated macro that generates IO based on some user preference?<p>
Yes -- I would agree that if I have to write and maintain a large amount of code to do easy stuff we've got a problem somewhere. But if my platform is powerful enough to allow me to use multiple Data Access paradigms without any work on my part? Who cares if when I flip the switch the code is generated and compiled or if it was generated and compiled last week or last year?<p>
Take a look at something like CodeSmith. Here's a tool that uses .NET to write programs for .NET. Now yes, you can generate a lot of code that way -- if you want to look at it like that. You can also go and get open source libraries and templates that will generate tested, proven, full-featured libraries based on your particular situation. Isn't that a much better thing than simply having one paradigm that everybody has to shoe-horn their work into?",1195589125

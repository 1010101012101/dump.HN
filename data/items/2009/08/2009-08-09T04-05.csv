750339,comment,749932,750170,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Under Gate's control, Microsoft destroyed Netscape as well as BeOS.  Netscape was, in the mid 1990's, attempting to create the ""browser OS"" that we're finally beginning to see today.  Had they not been driven out of business, we would quite possibly have been 5-10 years earlier in seeing the web-based products that we're finally seeing today.  Microsoft didn't want to have to deal with the decoupling of office suites from the OS (that would be the two legs that the MS monopoly stands on, after all), so they needed to ensure that web-based office suites couldn't happen.<p>BeOS was just plain an awesome OS.  Its networking was a joke, but the scheduler was awe-inspiring, and the default programming model of tons-o-threads would have produced a generation of programmers ready to handle today's multi-core reality.  Had users had the choice between windows 98 and BeOS, with decent application and vendor support for both, there would have been no contest.  Win98 was a joke, and Be was amazingly smooth and nice to use.  MS destroyed Be by forcing OEMs to choose between being Be partners and being MS ones.  Not a hard choice for the OEMs to make, unfortunately...<p>It was Bill that destroyed those companies.  It was Bill that set back both the web and desktop OS development by years.  Who else has done that much damage to the software industry?",1249793251

He then mocks them for being irrelevant.<p>After this, he goes on about his own struggle with sourcing in today's age. He invents his own (probably not unique) rule for anonymous sourcing and announces it and says he's going to spread the word. The ""Techcrunch House Rule"" for anonymous sourcing I guess.<p>Aren't these the issues that journalists deal with all the time? That's why they made those rules; the same reason he just made one.

I don't see why we should ignore things we find unfair or unreasonable. It might suit an economic model to imagine consumers all independently making utilitarian judgements but it has little or nothing to do with reality.<p>Morality actually plays an important part in society and we promote it because its the glue that binds us together. We speak out about things in the hope that the ideas of many people will come together collectively evoke positive change. In specific terms people hope that the negative press about Apple will make them change their minds.<p>What you are advocating is not a fairer market place, its people shutting their mouths so you don't have to hear opinions you don't like.

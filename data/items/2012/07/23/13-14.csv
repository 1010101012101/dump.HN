Of course websites could work around this by sending an e-mail message to the address to confirm ownership first, but this is rarely done in practice.<p>An easier fix is for users to randomize the email-addresses they use.  For example, if you have a Google Mail account, you can receive messages at username+randomdata@gmail.com; if you use different random data for each site, nobody will able to probe for your account as described in the article, even on poorly-designed websites.<p>The advantage of this approach is that it's something that privacy-minded users can do themselves, without having to rely on website developers to get things right.",1343051876

The images in these files <i>should</i> be user interface chrome shared by the majority of your app/site. Other inline images should be split across section-based CSS files (if your site is not a single page JS app).<p>""Secondly & more importantly, browsers completely block rendering while CSS downloads (with the exception of Opera, which unblocks after about 3 seconds), CSS does not render progressively.""<p>Except with at 500k sprite file (very common) your user waits for UI elements to pop-in that depend on it. So yes it doesn't block, but the UI can look strange. You end up with a bunch of blank spots or incomplete backgrounds while this sucker loads. Also if you dynamically add elements to the page that make requests for uncached sprite images (because you are being smart and don't want a 500k sprite file) you have to wait for those UI elements to load in their images.

4280954,comment,4279961,4279961,6,0,tmccall1101,,,"Great story. Large businesses like TWC create systems in which they can uniformly control the process of their employees providing a bridge between their product and their customers. Unfortunately, rarely are these systems as fine-tuned as Apple has their ""genius bar"" set up, for example. They're usually more similar to the DMV, where the paperwork and step-by-step process provides an experience that attempts to create an equal experience for all customers (that also allows for business-specific necessities, such as keeping a huge group of constantly changing data organized to go along with the DMV example), but the experience ends up being more of an obstacle or burden than it providing things like efficiency and flexibility.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that TWC sees no advantage of providing a better system. It costs money to uproot the current system, and it also costs money to create and run a system as detail-oriented as companies like Apple. They still get people to buy their product (even intelligent, insightful ones like the author of the article), and the profit margin is probably so significant that they consider it unnecessary to make Bill's day easier. Something that probably sounds a lot like, ""If Bill doesn't like his job, he can quit."" Or, ""If Steven (the author) doesn't like our product, he can find another place to give his business.""<p>The real problem is that TWC understands full and well what they're doing. You think they don't get hundreds of phone calls every week from angry customers or disgruntled employees? The fact of the matter is that they have the upper hand in terms of what the author was pointing out.<p>I just feel bad for Bill, and the thousands of people like him. This sort of thing makes you feel lucky not to be forced to lead a life that includes a job that is just one huge up-hill battle (in all the wrong senses of the phrase).<p>Good luck to Bill. My favorite part was his notice at the end to anyone who needs a master carpenter. I hope somebody contacts him who read that.<p>Edit: after reading more posts, it's clear that a large part of ""the problem"" has to do with the industry itself and the  players involved.

4280946,comment,4279905,4280587,3,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, if there's a strong political/ideological component to how they operate (I have no personal knowledge of that), that would explain the otherwise puzzling part of the policy where it restricts which subjects you can study. I've been trying to figure out the business angle on that, and it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. On the one hand, it <i>is</i> normal for employers to restrict tuition reimbursement to things plausibly relevant to an employee's job. But Amazon explicitly says here they aren't doing that. So if it's not to benefit the employer, then it's more of a perk. But if it's a perk, it's not clear how adding restrictions improves the perk. Why not let the employee decide what they want to study? It may lower the perceived value of the perk to some employees, if, say, they already have a trade and would consider some other subject more valuable to take a few classes in (improve their writing, increase their command of history, etc.).<p>But, it does make more sense if you view it not as a <i>business</i> decision, but as an ideological decision stemming from Bezos's personal views. If you view it as a sort of paternalist attempt to encourage his employees to do with their lives what he thinks more people should do with their lives, it fits better than if you try to figure out how it makes sense as part of a compensation package or business strategy.",1343051684

I told the same story above to a friend of mine who had been out of work for at least one or perhaps two years after finishing a degree from a video-game school as he was being offered a position as a web developer. I encouraged him to ask for just a little more than what he had offered, but he sent back an acceptance of the original offer from the employer as he was afraid of rocking the boat, and simply just wanted to get paid as bills began to mount up.<p>The original offer was for a $50K salary, which isn't terrible for starting out of school.

Back in 2002 when I switched after many years of Windows to the Mac, there was certainly far less.<p>It may be a question of price, though I also think that it could be a bout ease of buying. With the App Store people really only have to click twice to buy something. On Windows if you need a product as a solution to a problem, you need to go to different websites, compare their offers, everybody has a different payment provider, then you have to download and install. Really, I think that for many people pirating is not only cheaper but also far easier. And, since usually only good software is pirated, and not the crap, you don't even have to do so much research and cognitive burden to decide which offer to take. Other people already did that for you when they decided which one to pirate.<p>There're also studies though, where people find out that Mac users seem to be more inclined to pay for software. Maybe it's a question of initial price: When I pay a lot of money for a really good meal, I don't mind spending another 5 bucks for a great wine to accompany the taste of the meal.

This was the best account that I've read of the entire situation and has now educated me on to the ""dragnet"" that surrounds Julian Assange.<p>The TL;DR summary is that everything points to Sweden having being coerced at every juncture (by the US), and the Swedish police failing constantly.<p>----------------<p>I'd never actually been clear on what the ""sexual assault/rape/molestation"" charges were with Assange, but from the transcript, these charges were filed after two women Anna Ardin and Sofia Wilen went to the police to seek advice if they could compel Assange to take a STD test since they did not use a condom during sex.<p>It's unclear from the transcript, but from what I have read, these two women knew that he was sleeping with both of them. Both of the women went to the  Klara police station in central Stockholm, however, it is mentioned that Ardin had gone along primarily to support Wilen.<p>Ardin had been frequently in the company of Assange. She had previously described him as such a ""cool man"" (Twitter). They also arrived and left together at a Crayfish party (equivalent of a cocktail party). Ardin was sharing accomodation with Assange and had refused an offer from someone else  for temporary accomodation.<p>The day after the accusation of rape and molesation Ardin sent a SMS saying :  ""I've just spent some time with the coolest people in the world"".<p>SMS text messages were also exchanged between Sofia and Ardin, which showed that the two of them knew of the relationship between each other and Assange.<p>Ardin responded to a friend who was looking for Assange : ""He's not here. He's planned to have sex with the cashmere girl every evening, but not made it. Maybe he finally found time yesterday?""<p>The Swedish police, totally railroaded the investigation. Interviews have been leaked with Assange, and Wilen commented <i>initially</i> ""that she became so distraught she refused to give any more testimony and refused to sign what had been taken down."".<p>Assange went freely for interview to the police station and was released without immediate charge, and was free to travel. Almost immediately there after, another warrant was issued for his arrest.<p>Eventually, it was also upgraded to a ""Red Notice"". To put it into context, a red notice for such a trivial charge with a previously willful and responsive person is unusual.<p>> The president of Syria does not have a Red Notice alert. Gaddafi in Libya, at the same time Julian's arrest warrant was issued, was not subject to a Red Notice but an Orange Notice. It was an incredibly... it was incredibly unusual that a red notice would be sought for an allegation of this kind.<p>It's alleged (from the transcripts), that Sweden has frankly always been the United States' lap dog and it's not a matter we are particularly proud of. The Swedish Government has... essentially, whenever a US official says, ""Jump"", the Sweden Government asks, ""How high?""<p>Assange's legal team are clearly trying to point out that US is coercing all of this behind the scenes so that he can then be extradited from Sweden and face trial for conspiracy to commit espionage.<p>> The burden should be on the United States Government to say, ""We are not planning to prosecute Julian Assange"".

So that 0.5MB should be sufficient to saturate a 10Gbps link.<p>It seems that if you are trying to avoid blocking in a application when writing to a socket you should take a different strategy.<p>>  Latency spikes are a different situation, there are cases of constant high latency (e.g: inter-continental 1Gbps links).<p>Latency spikes in terms of this discussion can be caused by situations were you have a low speed network connected to a high speed network with a large buffer between them.<p>In this situation the server (or whatever) will write to the buffer on the bridge/router at a maximum amount rate allowed by the network. What should happen is that the router should block causing packet loss which will cause the TCP congestion algorithms to kick in and slow down the rate at which the packets are sent.<p>What actually happens is that the massive buffers fill up and when you have multiple connections competing for buffer space you will all of a sudden hit a brick wall. So what comes up with high  latency spikes, weird packet loss patterns, and such things.<p>Small buffers means high performance...",1343050431

Because we are now working on a higher level of abstraction. This code is more maintainable, easier to reuse and extend, and easier to test. What I've seen is that Backbone.js helps improve the structure of my JavaScript applications considerably.</i><p>I don't see any justification for those claims. In my experience, more code means less maintainable, because it's more to understand and provides more opportunities for bugs to creep in. I can look at the original 16 lines and understand immediately what's going on, while the 40 line result doesn't even fit onto my screen all at once, and the application logic is broken up and spread out across a bunch of boilerplate-type code.<p>Regarding reuse and extensibility, I don't see that here either. Sure, you can add more behavior when either element changes, but you could have done that before just as well. For reuse, what's the likely-hood that you're going to need a control like this, which seems to be tightly bound to the application requirements? If you're writing a library or generic control reuse is important, but most of the time most developers are writing custom one-off requirement-specific controls, and reuse just isn't as important as clarity and simplicity. Besides, if you <i>really</i> wanted to reuse the original, you could move it all into a function and pass 'new-status' and 'statuses' as arguments; then any form/textarea/ul triplet can be used as a control.<p>Finally, testability: yes, I'll grant that your final version is more scriptable which makes it easier to write automated tests. However, you've also got a lot more to test, because now your code is subject to bugs in the 1000 lines of Backbone code you've made yourself dependent upon. What if there is some problem in the communication with your service? That's buried in Backbone and you're insulated from it, unlike in the original where $.ajax gives you nearly direct control over all aspects of the communication. The original, being much simpler, is also easier to visually inspect for bugs. Not much can go wrong in 16 lines of tightly integrated code, but once you switch over to inserting bits of behavior into a larger framework that you don't control and probably don't understand, who knows when your code will get executed (or not) and what edge cases might arise?<p>BTW, yes I know jQuery is a much larger and more complex dependency, but both the original and final examples depend on it equally. More importantly, your code calls jQuery rather than jQuery calling your code: your code stays in control. With frameworks like Backbone, your code gives up control to the framework.",1343049458

I will say it again; you are gambling here with probably the best years of your life. Don't be crazy thinking 1-2% in a startup will make you rich. It won't. You'll just work yourself into ill health ; something which you will never be able to restore in the rest of your life and you'll not gain much besides the knowledge that you should never do or have done this in the first place.<p>Please check some statistics of startups; by far most go bankrupt, the rest disappear; might be sold to another company, might just close the doors with some blahblah story of 'it was just an experiment and it failed' => was it just an experiment for you, burning 80+ hours/week for 1-2% + a few $? Even being bought sounds like payday; it's not, especially for funded companies. It's just vultures picking dead bodies.<p>Then the minuscule (REALLY TINY; like furiouscowbell says below; it's playing the lottery, but at least in the lottery you get to work 0 hours/week) percentage which remains will indeed make you rich for your 1-2%; shame you didn't go work there! You picked another one; even without knowing you, I know this for a fact :) It's a safe bet for me to say this.<p>Please don't throw years of your life away doing this; start your own or work, for a good salary at a big/solid/hip one (Facebook, Google) and go from there. Make your mark there and then use the money you earned and super team you worked with to start your own.<p>Edit: if it's your own startup it's (can be) a  lot of fun but you know the odds going in and your startup is different! You have to believe that and that's good. But if you are just tricked into working for nothing on someone else's dream it needs to be your dream as well, and who does that for less than a significant stake in the company anyway?",1343048532

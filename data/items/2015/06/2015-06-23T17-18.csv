9766353,comment,9762001,9765761,0,0,samch,,,"&quot;No question that a lot of the tools developed under generative grammar have proved useful, and one can certainly cite the Huxleyan principle that truth comes sooner from error than from a vacuum.  I think I would say that the American structuralist tradition was headed in a wrong direction from at least 1933 (Bloomfield&#x27;s Language) and that Chomsky (despite the claims of his followers that he made a revolutionary break from structuralism) simply gave structuralism a mathematical rigor that allowed it to be taken to its logical conclusion.  The tools that were developed in the process have allowed the field (or the more brain-oriented parts of it) to move in a rather decisively different direction.<p>Full disclosure:  I got my PhD at Yale under Syd Lamb, so naturally I would not be classed as a Chomskyan.  It took me some years to realize that Lamb&#x27;s StratGram itself suffered from the same reductionist flaws.  The only theoretical school I know of that had a chance of moving in the right direction (until very recently) was Firth&#x27;s.  Unfortunately, neither he nor his followers developed the theoretical tools that were needed.  Certainly Halliday&#x27;s Systemics became as reductionist as any of the others.  Hudson&#x27;s word grammar made some good moves but never really developed well.  So yeah, Chomsky set something in motion that produced some useful theoretical tools that could be used to help push off in new directions.  But the TGG tradition, being a well developed extension of the Bloomfieldian tradition, is still basically a dead end.&quot;<p>-My dad",1435081914

Don&#x27;t like your job, well you can&#x27;t go and find a new one unless they are willing to sponsor you for a visa. Want to start a side business - nope, thats a grey area that I&#x27;ve had immigration laywers advise me against. Think you deserve a promotion - nope, your residency application was for a particular job description. The list goes on.<p>A few months ago, I came very close to being deported due to the business unit I worked in being divested to another company - this isn&#x27;t a problem for H1B employees, but I had an L1 which is non-transferrable to a new company, and since my job at my existing company was no longer present I would be made redundant if I couldn&#x27;t get employment at the aquiring company. Luckily for me, my residency application became current 2 weeks before the aquisition closed (I had been waiting on this application for almost 3 years), so I was able to move into another immigration status that allowed me to move over to the acquiring company.<p>If that hadn&#x27;t happened I would have been left with no job, A pregnant wife (who would also lose her job - as her work auth is tied to my visa) and facing an expensive move back to NZ (relocating a family internationally is really expensive btw).

This is the same kind of fallacy as &quot;if a company went out of business, it must&#x27;ve been a bad company&quot;, and also &quot;the invisible hand of gravity means it&#x27;s good that the vase broke&quot;.<p>For example, there&#x27;s tons of cultures that think murder for personal grievances is okay and praise-worthy. I&#x27;ve seen first hand what happens when such a culture meets a gentle Western culture, when the latter doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming force advantage. It&#x27;s not pretty.",1435081326

9766271,comment,9765354,9766081,0,0,tptacek,,,"There are two specific issues that come up regularly, and two background issues with the whole concept of free trade agreements.<p>Specific issue #1: the TPP, like a bunch of other trade agreements, includes semi-binding arbitration. Enact a system of regulated free trade and you generate disputes. But there&#x27;s no meaningful international legal system (a &quot;world trade court&quot; that can resolve those disputes. Trade dispute resolution is therefore extrajudicial. (TPP&#x27;s arbitration is &quot;semi-binding&quot; in that TPP arbitrators have authority only to impose fines; they can&#x27;t change our laws).<p>Specific issue #2: a key goal of TPP is to harmonize worldwide IP laws with those of the US. But much of the world has lax IP laws compared to the US, specifically for drugs. Dean Baker at CEPR --- a credible and fiercely liberal economist --- believes drug regulation will increase prices in the US (by how much, I haven&#x27;t really seen estimates). Pretty much everyone believes that if TPP is actually enforced for pharma, it will increase drug prices in the rest of the world, and also squeeze out companies that have carved niches for themselves by arbitraging the different patent regimes to manufacture drugs that are still on-patent in the US.<p>Background issue #1: modern free trade agreements always involve IP regulations, and IP is a valence issue on Internet forums: most vocal Internet commenters ambiently oppose all IP regulation. TPP doesn&#x27;t significantly alter IP law in the US, but it does further ratify that law, taking us steps away from reforming them. If you think IP reform was in the cards, you don&#x27;t like TPP.<p>Background issue #2: the US economy is, by design, owned by large companies; those companies are in turn mostly owned by large investment firms. A plurality of the stakeholders in those firms are &quot;wealthy elites&quot; (not scare quoting). Free trade agreements that the US supports are designed to juice the economy, and thus improve outcomes for big companies. &quot;Wealthy elites&quot; have far more direct exposure to investment upside than &quot;workers&quot;. So there&#x27;s a natural concern about conflict-of-interest: TPP will benefit the wealthy more than it will the working class.<p>There are reasonable rebuttals to all these points, but you asked for the liberal brief against TPP, and I think that&#x27;s a solid summary of it.",1435081158

As popehat noted, that&#x27;s different: everyone acknowledges that there is some legal authority for a subpoena. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s been said to be an abuse of it because these are not true threats.<p>2) The &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard is not &quot;what Aqueous, HN commentator, thinks a reasonable person would view as a threat&quot;, but a legal construct. While reasonable person is an ordinary language term, as these terms are used in courts, they establish precedents and criteria that are used. Ken White mentioned some criteria, tptacek mentioned some others. I don&#x27;t see you offering any guidance beyond &quot;seems reasonable to me&quot;.<p>3) As for the appeal to authority, you don&#x27;t understand what that means. If you were citing actual evidence of anything, it might be appropriate to argue that dismissing it was an appeal to authority. But both you and White are basically saying &quot;trust me, I know how the courts treat threats&quot;. In that context, the fact that he is a federal prosecutor, and therefore intimately acquainted with what courts do is quite relevant, and the fact that it really sounds like you&#x27;re just making this up as you go along is also quite relevant. As I said, I do acknowledge that you could be right. It&#x27;s just that you have absolutely failed to give anyone a reason to think so.<p>If you assert first order logic is complete, and I say it&#x27;s not, then it&#x27;s a good question which of us studied math.

9766168,comment,9764564,9765732,0,0,hluska,,,"I&#x27;m not the OP, but I mostly support the idea of open borders and I&#x27;m from Canada. Canada has many of the same issues that New Zealand has. We are the second largest country (by landmass) in the world, yet our population is slightly smaller than California. Much of our land is quite rugged, or very cold but our country is still capable of supporting more than the 35 million we currently have.<p>The best argument that I have ever heard against opening up our border is that we are big, but size does not equal the ability to support a decent quality of life. Some argue that if we open up our borders, dreams of higher incomes will compel lesser skilled people to move to Canada. These people often will not understand basic labour laws like minimum wage, or the need for benefits and so they will drive down the cost of labour. Others argue that adding even five million people sounds like a good idea, but that it would require massive investments in health care, housing, and basic infrastructure.<p>Like I said, I mostly support open borders but have never been too impressed by the moral arguments. Canada is a great country and I love it dearly, but I have spent a little too much in some bad neighbourhoods and become friends with too many unhappy immigrants. Rather, I would argue that we are an amazing country, but that many immigrants who bought into the hype, came here and live in poverty far worse than that which they escaped. I say &#x27;far worse&#x27; because, while our social safety net is fairly good, it involves navigating an intense bureaucracy that is difficult for native English speakers and near impossible for immigrants, especially those with more limited English language skills. And, unfortunately, parts of our population are very anti-immigration and argue that they should &#x27;stay home&#x27; instead of clogging up our social services.<p>Morally, I think that I could just as easily argue that we should stop all immigration entirely until we can do a better job of caring for the immigrants that we already have.<p>My all-time favourite argument in favour of opening up our immigration system is that it is one of the best chances  that we have of saving our manufacturing industry. Since the 2008 financial crisis, much of the manufacturing industry has been in a horrible shambles and years later, factory jobs simply have not returned to eastern Canada. Factory jobs have mostly been a victim of cost and so the theory goes that opening up borders to lesser skilled people will drive down the cost of lower skilled labour. If you drive the cost of lower skilled labour down closer to minimum wage and get rid of the often union negotiated benefits, suddenly the cost disparity between producing in Canada versus China or Mexico looks a little better.<p>Another argument I love is that the last time our borders were mostly open, we allowed an influx of mostly eastern European people to come into our country. (My last name is Hluska and my great grandfather was one of them). There were some growing pains and for many people (my great grandfather included), the move to Canada was really difficult. However, after a few generations, these immigrants&#x27; children and grandchildren have become important entrepreneurs, business and political leaders.<p>So, the argument goes that in our history, mostly open borders lead to a difficult decade or two, but that the kind of person who will immigrate tends to be resourceful enough to bring enhanced opportunity for many generations after.",1435080377

Methane is also by definition the cleanest burning hydrocarbon, with the fewest CO2 molecules per energy provided. In the US alone, it&#x27;s estimated that nat gas has the average household pocketing $800 yearly since the fracking boom. In addition, a geoscientist recently told me it&#x27;s estimated that we&#x27;re only extracting about 10% of the natural gas available per well, meaning there&#x27;s tons more down there. It has serious potential, and at least the US&#x27;s electric infrastructure is rapidly changing to accommodate it. Anyway, what I&#x27;m getting at is maybe we shouldn&#x27;t count out natural gas.",1435080354

Although you&#x27;d sacrifice advanced functionality of hundreds of LaTeX packages, but people who wrote those packages could&#x27;ve easily written TeX macro-collections. LaTeX is used more only because it has more momentum behind it; otherwise PlainTex is a much cleaner approach.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to get under the hood of the whole system, I highly recommend Knuth&#x27;s The TeXbook.<p>P.S.: Just for comparison, LaTeX *.ltx files are about ~10,000 LOCs compared to ~1200 LOCs of plain.tex (which is fully documented in Appendix B of The TeXbook).",1435080333

We had it in the kitchen, and it was a really nice concept to be able to say, &quot;Alexa, play Hotel California by The Eagles&quot; in the middle of cooking dinner, without having to clean off your hands and touch your phone, but really, Alexa could only play a sample of Hotel California by the Eagles, unless you owned it it in your Prime music library. Deeper integration with Spotify or Rdio or something would have fixed this. Maybe it&#x27;s already been fixed, but if not, that&#x27;s a fatal flaw.<p>- The hardware quality, including the remote, was top notch.<p>- At $100, it could be very compelling for rooms where your hands are busy.  I almost kept it just for the garage, so I could use it while working on the car, or working out, or cleaning up.  The kitchen is another good option.  But the lack of complete music integration, and the fact that I could resell it on eBay and make money, made me give up on it.",1435079970

While some or most of them are continuing to invest in upgrading infrastructure, most of them are also rolling around in billions of dollars of profit that they aren&#x27;t investing...because there is no real market incentive to do what you&#x27;re saying they &quot;should&quot; do.<p>>  &quot;You get a 1 Gigabit connection for $75/month, with a 10 Terabyte/month Limit during Peak hours, and Unlimited Terabyte limit in Off peak hours,<p>What a world that would be.

I prefer it over Spotify/Rdio/Beats because it works better with Google Now voice actions, and I can run it well on every device I care to.<p>My remaining problem with it is their device limit. You can have 10 total devices, but you can deauthorize only 4 per year. This sounds like a lot but if you switch phones often or flash new ROMs you can use it up pretty quickly. In addition, if you upload music to the service the computer you use counts as a device. Once you&#x27;re at your limit there&#x27;s little you can do and you have no information on when you&#x27;ll get a device deauthorization &quot;credit&quot; again.

I have some model of the general effects of allowing greater immigration, but the predictive value of the model breaks down the more radical the change.<p>- I see letting in anyone with the equivalent of a bachelor&#x27;s degree (or say anyone that anyone is willing to hire for more $40k a year) as basically having no downsides at all. Empirical data on immigration reveals that it has no impact on wages except at the very low end, among unskilled high-school dropouts.<p>- As you allow lower incomes, welfare tends to become an issue. Currently, people do not immigrate in the US for the welfare (illegal immigrants tend to be net taxpayers, even when including healthcare) but people do immigrate to Europe for the welfare, so it&#x27;s something that happens. However, if you take a country like France (where I grew up in), welfare payments aren&#x27;t the biggest drag on the economy. Taxation is high, but other places with similar levels of taxation fare much better. Regulatory drag, in particular in the job market is a much bigger concern. In turns, this creates unemployment which aggravates any welfare problem. Evidence shows that as societies become more culturally and ethnically mixed, they tend to be less and less in favor of welfare. So higher immigration of welfare seeking immigrants may undermine popular support for welfare. It&#x27;s a whole other discussion, but I&#x27;d consider disappearance of state funded welfare as a good thing. In addition, it&#x27;s also possible to selectively deny welfare to immigrants, or to require a twenty year residency period before becoming eligible.<p>- Political externalities are often mentioned. Won&#x27;t immigrants vote for the same policies that made their home country a living hell? I find this doubtful for two reasons:<p><pre><code>  a) The evidence points that in most democracies, the policies that end up being enacted are the ones favored by a wealthy elite, not the ones that have popular support. If you compare the actual policies of the US compared to the views of the median voter, they are strikingly better than you&#x27;d expect. How this comes to be is unclear, but the effect is important.

 b) The favorite political view of most people is the status quo, or some very minor version around it

Now getting to New Zealand. Assuming only honest hard working immigrant seeking a better life? You&#x27;ve cut out the work for me! I think you&#x27;d see a lot of high rises build up in New Zealand. Consider that the current population of New Zealand could fit in a circle 7 km in radius in a city with the density of New York. If Stewart Island was all built up, it could hold the entire population of Canada.<p>In practice, as more people would emigrate, real estate prices would appreciate, to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t be economical for immigrants to come in, even if the borders were open.",1435079275

3. Negotiations conclude
4. 180 day notification prior to signing agreement
5. 90 day notification of intention to sign agreement

8. Agreement signed (not law yet)<p># Reporting and Mock Markup

11. Mock markups (no time schedule)

It usually gets brought up when news about their declining population hits the front page. &quot;<i>Well maybe if they made it easier to immigrate they wouldn&#x27;t have a problem!</i>&quot; is a common comment to see.<p>Only, that&#x27;s wrong. Their immigration is pretty standard. It has nearly identical requirements as the U.S and Canada. In fact, it&#x27;s actually easier to become a Japanese citizen than it is to become a U.S citizen. Japan allows immigration from more countries than the U.S.<p>Another thing is that if you&#x27;re married or have a job in Japan, they&#x27;ll let you stay with a green card indefinitely. No need to become a naturalized citizen. It&#x27;s incredibly rare for them to &quot;change their minds&quot; and revoke a green card. It&#x27;s practically unheard of unless you commit a crime of some sort. Even then, there&#x27;s still a good chance they won&#x27;t unless your crime is severe.<p>My point is that most countries have similar requirements for immigration. If you&#x27;ve only tried immigrating to a single country, you have nothing to compare too. Immigration isn&#x27;t supposed to be easy and you should <i>expect</i> tedious and head banging bureaucracy.",1435078996

Ben Cruachan (the one I visited) can generate 440MW for up to 22 hours before the reservoir empties.

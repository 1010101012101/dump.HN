I have really tried to get your point, but all I see is a marketing pitch: <i>""pace of innovation... it will be years... higher efficiency...""</i> Come on, this is not a business school restroom. Be specific please.<p>Reality is that there are always 3 big components to any <i>software</i>: code, data and runtime. You can download/cache any of the 3, in different proportions. <p>Now define ""online app"". Is it something that downloads all 3 components? Nope, since runtime is always local (browser/flash/silverlight).<p>My original point is that it makes alot of sense to push as much code down to customer's computer as possible, distributing the load (because it simply makes sense). The runtime will always sit at consumer's computer, because runtimes are fat, ugly and a paint to install securely. <p>So... basicaly it all comes to where you want to store your data.<p>",1181717992

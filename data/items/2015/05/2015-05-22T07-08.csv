I understand that Mozilla needs money to operate but this will drive away a lot of people. Most average users won&#x27;t mind this kind of behavior though. A simple pop-up once you update/install Firefox saying something like &quot;Would you like to turn on interest based tiles?&quot; should do the trick. Either that or a separate build of Firefox (dev edition?).<p>I&#x27;m a strong opponent when it comes to sharing more then needed.

Or €2.50...<p>But I don&#x27;t really get why people are comparing Nespresso to having coffee outside the house. I need an expresso the moment I wake up, before I wash, before I dress.<p>It&#x27;s really not about the money; it&#x27;s about convenience, reliability. Peace of mind. Nespresso makes uncertainty go away. Your morning coffee becomes one less thing to worry about. It&#x27;s going to be perfect. Every time.<p>Nespresso doesn&#x27;t try to hide the fact that they&#x27;re ridiculously expensive; their stores look like jewelry shops and are tended by weirdly handsome individuals with perfectly manicured hands, and one or two guards at the front will open the door for you.<p>Or if you prefer, you can have capsules delivered at home, in a 2-hour window, by a special messenger on a scooter... for free!! (nobody else does this, not Amazon, not anyone).<p>They can afford all this and more, and people pay for it, and can&#x27;t get enough of it. It&#x27;s like iPhones.",1432281572

It&#x27;s probably the most exciting robotics/manipulation project I&#x27;m currently aware of.<p>What&#x27;s exciting here is that the entire system is trained end-to-end (including the vision component). In other words, it&#x27;s heading towards agents/robots that consist entirely of a single neural net and that&#x27;s it; There is no software stack at all - it&#x27;s just a GPU running a neural net &quot;code base&quot;, from perception to actuators. In this respect this work is similar to the Atari game-playing agent that has to learn to see while also learning to play the game. Except this setting is quite a lot more difficult in some respects; In particular, the actions in the Deepmind Atari paper are few and discrete, while here the robot is an actual physical system with a very large-dimensional and continuous action space (joint torques). Also, if you&#x27;re new to the field you might think &quot;why is the robot so slow?&quot;, while someone in the field is thinking &quot;holy crap how can it be so fast?&quot;",1432281077

I don&#x27;t wait for the machine to heat up for 30 mins (only till the light comes on) and I might even grind the beans the day before, and I always use a double shot of coffee to make a single espresso.

9586961,comment,9585519,9585519,0,0,chipx86,,,"I used to do a lot of REBOL programming, back in the day. I even wrote some tutorials for an old webdev site called Gelicon.<p>Back then, there was no Django or Ruby on Rails, and while PHP worked, it wasn&#x27;t always suitable for a lot of tasks. With REBOL, for instance, I could (and did) build a client that would  read from some early web services, parse the data, and then interface with IRC servers to both stream some of the data to a channel and act as a control interface for further parsing, along with generating static webpages from the data. Implementing each part of that was a lot easier than most languages I&#x27;ve used (assuming you&#x27;re not using third-party modules for things like IRC).<p>What made REBOL cool, back when it was new, was just how easy it was to work with the Internet and parse results. For instance, see the one-liner in example 42 on that link, which scrapes a page for all links:<p><pre><code>    parse read http://www.rebol.com [any [thru &quot;A HREF=&quot; copy link to &quot;>&quot; (print link)] to end]
</code></pre>
That reads from www.rebol.com and sets up a parser for it with the given rules. Those rules state that it should skip all bytes through &quot;A HREF=&quot;, then copy any bytes up until the &quot;>&quot; into a &quot;link&quot; variable, and then print the variable. Simple example, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to write something a lot more complex.<p>The language can be a bit wonky at first, but especially back then, once you learned it, it was fantastic and fun. Writing a parser for a protocol like IRC was just easy. You could easily output a file that was both data and a valid self-parsing REBOL program. Writing a self-modifying program to store the state for the next run was almost trivial. You could write little DSLs for whatever you wanted.

The core of REBOL was free, and you could do a lot with that, but you could not invoke external programs or bind to any native libraries. To gain that functionality, you had to pay a decent amount (at least for me, at the time) for a full license. There may have also been restrictions on bundling the core REBOL interpreter.<p>I believe that&#x27;s all free now, but then, the world&#x27;s grown beyond Perl and PHP since then. REBOL had a lot of time to grow beyond where it seems to be now. I still think about coding something up in REBOL every so often, but I usually just reach for Python instead.<p>Still, fun language.

   cleansing may involve murder only to the point
   of mobilizing the target group out of the
   territory. Hence there may be varied degrees of
   mass murder in an ethnic cleansing, often
   subsiding when the target group appears to be
   leaving the desired territory, while during
   genocide the mass murder is ubiquitous and
   constant throughout the process, continuing
   even while the target group tries to flee.

That is to say, freshly ground stale beans still taste stale.  Pre-ground fresh beans still taste OK after a week (but won’t be suitable for an espresso machine.)<p>The biggest difference in taste comes from selecting specific beans and roasting them carefully.  You may or may not find it an improvement.  It seems most supermarket coffees are selected to have the same kinds of taste and I find them nearly universally bland.  When I make coffee for other people I get a 50/50 split between those who immediately notice an enjoyable difference from supermarket coffee and those who don&#x27;t care.  Personally, I find instant coffee very unappealing but some people enjoy the taste of that too.<p>I think the closest comparison is wine.  Nearly everybody likes wine and accepts that different grapes (beans) give different flavours.  Most people agree that the very, very cheap wine often tastes like silver polish.  The remainder may or may not then have a preference between a £15 bottle and a £5 bottle.  Those who do then may or may not differentiate between specific qualities of those wines.<p>I&#x27;d suggest buying a bag or two from a speciality roaster such as www.hasbean.co.uk  Get it pre-ground and see if you prefer the difference.  If you do then consider getting a grinder for another leap in quality.<p>The same website has a brew guide for the moka pot – it’s a great way of making coffee and everybody uses it differently.

It saves me a lot of time, a little money, and consistently provides (for my tastebuds) better coffee than I can get within a 3 mile radius of where I live.  (somewhere in los angeles).<p>I buy capsules 50 at a time, for .70c a capsule + 7 dollars shipping, no tax.  So that comes to about 42 dollars total, or $0.84 per cup of coffee.<p>That enables me to consume 2 capsules per day for $1.68 per day, or $11.76 per week, and usually I drink less on weekends.<p>Coffee sold locally in the stores of high quality here tends to be a minimum of 10 dollars per pound, and normally to really &quot;select&quot; one I prefer, would cost around $13.00. I like to brew my coffee strong, and still would drink 2 cups of coffee per day, so this tends to run out for me about 6 days of my 7 day week.<p>So while its slightly cheaper for me to drink nespresso, its almost the same price.<p>But, with nespresso, I go from rolling out of bed to the kitchen, and within 30 seconds I have really good tasting coffee, no mess, and I can easily select the type of pour I want, capsule I want, etc.  It is truly extremely convenient.<p>Furthermore they are an example of outstanding customer service.  My machine had a malfunction once.  Called them on first day, they over-nighted me a replacement machine while I sent my in for free repair.  Got the original back a few days later.  Hardly any downtime w/o a machine.  Total cost: $0.00, and the machine wasn&#x27;t even under warranty.  Obviously they want to keep selling me coffee.  I have no issue with that.<p>Finally, they offer recycling programs which work good, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being a bad citizen of the earth by supporting them.<p>I see it as sort of a Spotify of coffee.  You pay repeatedly one company for good service, and if it meets your needs, it is going to save you time and money if its something you do a lot.  For those that are into coffee on a deeper level, is sort of those who are into music on a deeper level.<p>For me with regards to music, I am a bit of a control freak, I like to know what bit rate file I am playing, I like to back them up carefully and managing my music collection I invest time and have lots of pride about - so Spotify (While I generally like their service), is not for me.<p>The same can be said of Nespresso.  If you love the entire process of making espresso, getting into the gear, and the execution of how its made and putting that kind of time into it and getting a specific kind of joy out of it, Nespresso would probably not be the right choice.<p>I guess I have enough hobbies, but I still really like well made espresso at home.

Last week (inspired by HN thread [2]) I&#x27;ve jumped into this project once again. In January Lambda was a big &quot;wow&quot; for me, but now I see some things that have to be taken into consideration:<p>1/ Fine-Grained Access Control is there [3], but it is performed on a pretty late stage of user-system interaction. When user assumed a role with some auth provider, then he/she can freely play with all AWS methods bundled in a well documented SDK [4].<p>2/ Codebase distribution means security distribution. You are authenticating user with FB/G+/Amz, then you have FGAC on DynamoDB table, then you need caller policy to call Lambda function remotely, then in Lambda function you need to check permissions one more time and the Lambda function have to have policy of what can be executed.<p>3/ In theory, Lambda functions are highly decoupled and testable (fn(payload, ctx)). But most of the time using Lambda makes sense in conjunction with other AWS services. Mocking Amazon&#x27;s ecosystem isn&#x27;t so easy.<p>4/ This model of computing may lead to oversized architectures, using &quot;one more&quot; AWS service to &quot;close the loop&quot;, some strange solutions like watching/analyzing files in S3 buckets and so on...<p>I&#x27;ve seen a huge vendor lock-in from the beginning, I&#x27;ve been aware of potential security/architecture problems.

9586893,comment,9585718,9586504,0,0,pmontra,,,"I know only three reasons for that:<p>1) MySQL is bundled in so many low cost PHP hosting services that it is an almost forced choice if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and presumibly at a very small scale. But anything would do there, maybe even a SQLite backend. Furthermore you usually don&#x27;t have to really &quot;know&quot; the database you&#x27;re using if all you do are basic selects, inserts and updates. Chances are that your code will work on any DB and MySQL will be perfectly fine for that kind of applications.<p>2) At large scale, setting up a cluster of MySQL servers is a more established practice than setting up a cluster of PostgreSQL servers. This is slowly changing as replication features are added to PostgreSQL&#x27;s core and BDR will be fully developed for 9.5 or 9.6 but it will take time before you find as many experts of PostgreSQL than you have for MySQL.<p>3) The diagramming tool of MySQL Workbench is far better that anything you can get for free for PostgreSQL. The closest match is Valentina Studio which is not as usable.<p>I can provide plenty or arguments for not using MySQL though. I&#x27;ll leave them to a search for why mysql sucks but I want to add some of mine. I&#x27;m migrating a project from PostgreSQL to MariaDB (drop in compatible with MySQL). The customer made the choice not because of technical reasons and I don&#x27;t think I can get into the details. The annoying facts we are facing:<p>1) A whole mess with TIMESTAMPS that is getting sorted out only with MySQL 5.6 and MariaDB 10&#x27;s switches for 5.6 compatibility <a href=""http://shankargopal.blogspot.it/2013/03/mysql-566-timestamp-columns-and-default.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shankargopal.blogspot.it/2013/03/mysql-566-timestamp-...</a> (&quot;In MySQL versions prior to 5.6, behavior of columns with default values for the TIMESTAMP column type is pretty much nonstandard [...]&quot;)<p>2) A pretty horrible procedural language adding complications over the PostgreSQL one and lacking some features we gave for granted. We must do some processing inside the database not to move whole tables to the application server so we have a few stored procedures. What used to be a < 20 lines procedure in PostgreSQL is becoming a 50+ lines little monster in MySQL/MariaDB because, for example, they can&#x27;t return directly a resultset unless it comes straight from a SELECT. We&#x27;re doing some processing on those SELECTs so we must create a temporary table, insert into it and select from it at the end. Ah, inserting 1100 records (INT, VARCHAR) into that temporary table took 40 seconds. We googled around and discovered that creating it with ENGINE=MEMORY fixes the problem. But even writing that to disk... 40 seconds?<p>3) The lack of row_number also gave us some problems in grouping records on some columns and picking the ones with the most recent timestamp for each group. See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895110/row-number-in-mysql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895110/row-number-in-mys...</a> for examples. We built our query over this answer <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/9652359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/9652359</a>
In general, MySQL has a pattern of being the only database among the big relational ones that doesn&#x27;t have feature X or supports it in a non standard way.<p>4) MySQL&#x27;s EXPLAIN doesn&#x27;t seem as informative as PostgreSQL&#x27;s EXPLAIN ANALYZE but maybe we&#x27;re still missing something.<p>Summing it up, IMHO MySQL is OK for INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE applications with simple queries but this experience is confirming my years long policy of trying to steer clear from it.<p>Edit:<p>5) If you&#x27;re using Ruby, the mysql driver (mysql2) could be slower than the PostgreSQL one (pg). I have a seeding script written in Ruby and it got unbeliveably slow with MySQL (20 times as slow). I opened an issue and you find the details there <a href=""https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/623"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/623</a>
One of the mysql2 maintainers has been kind and helped me to fix the problem in this particular scenario (grouping inserts together) but it seems that the PostgreSQL driver is more efficient at sending data to the DB (it uses prepared statements, mysql2 doesn&#x27;t yet) so your application could have a performance boost by using PostgreSQL over MySQL.
Be careful: this problem is Ruby specific, most probably not due to the database, and probably it&#x27;s workload specific (you could say that Ruby&#x27;s slow anyway, but still, when nearly all of what you do it talking with the database...)",1432278317

These PostgreSQL machines were also inherited from a company we acquired, so some of my negative impressions can likely be explained by them being set up poorly, which sadly seems to be the norm.<p>PostgreSQL&#x27;s replication has evolved slowly over the years, and as a result it&#x27;s idiosyncratic, complicated to get right, and hard to generalize about. There aren&#x27;t a lot of great setup guides and tutorials on the subject either.<p>Postgres replication works by shipping WAL (transaction/redo) logs to slaves, and the slaves are in a constant state of DB recovery. Streaming replication does so as writes happen, and file based log shipping copies the logs when the 16MB segment is complete. Ours were set up to use streaming replication, without having a separate file-based archive log host to use to fetch older logs. Whenever the write load became too much and the slaves could no longer keep up with the master WAL logs on the master would expire and replication would break entirely, requiring you to rebuild all your slaves from backup. This was my introduction to PG replication. Apparently PG 9.4 has &#x27;replication slots&#x27; or something that make this less of a headache.<p>WAL logs were also applied without checksums or verification which corrupted the entire replication chain, and as I remember we didn&#x27;t discover this until the corrupt pages got hit by a query.<p>Software upgrades with PG seemed to be a huge pain as well, we could never figure out how long they were going to take, and even if the on-disk formats didn&#x27;t change, somehow all the cardinality stats on our tables disappeared, and all our query plans went to shit until we ran some process to rebuild them, which took days.<p>Operationally there were some things that made our team angry. We couldn&#x27;t figure out how to reparent a slave without completely re-cloning it from the new parent, even though it was completely up to date from the authoritative master at the time of the reparenting. Also, do you really have to take down the entire cluster to change max connections on a slave? Many such settings seemed to not be dynamic and must remain in sync across the entire chain. One of the things people seem to love about PG is how correct and proper it is respecting the sanctity of your data. As an ops person I&#x27;d much rather deal with slightly inconsistent replicas (common in MySQL) than have to fight with how rigid PG is.",1432278282

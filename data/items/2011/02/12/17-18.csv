To them, making math fun is the same idea as bringing a clown into the pediatric burn ward:  ""Let's make this suck a little less.""  That attitude rubs off on the kids.<p>What those teachers don't get is that math is most fun when you are using solid, polished skills to explore an area where you're still learning.  The teachers are stuck in the standard educational mindset, which is that getting enough practice at anything to develop polished skills is ""rote"" and horrible.  Plus it slows down their curriculum.  So they move on and just do some review now and then, and the mediocre students end up with <i>no</i> solid skills they can rely on.  All their skills are a little iffy, so they can't do <i>anything</i> with confidence, and everything is stressful.",1297533357

You need to learn how they work, and in particular they can surprise you a bit if you don't turn fullsweep on by hanging around in the binary heap longer than you'd expect after all processes are done with it, but you are <i>not</i> doing the runtime any favors by using a lot of ""strings"" instead. (Fullsweep isn't the only answer either, it's just an easy thing to quickly say in an HN post.)<p>In Erlang, slices of binaries are by default references to the original, and if you want a true copy (within a single Erlang OS process, sending it across processes will make one automatically of course) you need to ask for it, with binary:copy, available only in relatively recent releases. In the context of where Erlang tends to run, I think this is the correct default behavior, but it does mean that you end up having to do at least a little smidge of memory-management-type thinking. Since your Erlang code is very likely to be something that takes a packet in, does ""something"", and sends it somewhere else without hanging on to it indefinitely, this can work well as long as you don't leak references.",1297532382

The advantage of Amazon is that while the content has DRMd for the end user, they can read it on a variety of devices.  Also, the selection is excellent (not perfect, but for light reading, pretty good).  I don't see Apple winning the content war on this one.

It resulted in less downtime, reduced the cognitive load on our developers, and let us turn changes and bug fixes faster, which just made everyone happier. Here is the approach we took --<p>We got continuous integration working first by setting up an automated test server. We used cerberus, which is a trivially simple ruby gem that simply polls a repo, grabs code, runs tests, and reports the result. You could install this anywhere, even an old Mac mini if you wanted. We spun up a low end server for it. We wrote great tests, got decent coverage, and made adjustments in our automated testing strategy to increase our confidence.<p>Then we worked on zero-downtime deployment and rollback. This was actually the hardest part for us. With regard to schema changes, if we had to hammer our database (new index on a big table) then we needed to take the site down, but otherwise our strategy was to always add to the scheme, wait for the dust to settle, and then remove things later. This worked for us, but we had a relatively simple schema.<p>I haven't quite figured out how an ajax-heavy site would pull this off. That seems like a hard problem since you need to detect the changes and refresh your javascript code.<p>We then combined these two to get automated deployment to a staging server. We could have written monitoring code at this point, but we decided to punt on that, relying on email notification for crashes and watching our performance dashboard.<p>And finally, we set it up to deploy to production, and it just worked, and we never looked back.

After losing all my work when my laptop got soaked in college I was prepared for the next go round. I've taken all my notes in Evernote (not the greatest writing interface - fabulous for other things and importing docs) or Google Docs. I exclusively use the Cr-48 for school except for writing papers because footnotes and legal writing guidelines are just easier in Word.<p>All of my extensions synced over upon signing in, like on an Android phone. LastPass worked right away without any hassles. Ditto for bookmarks.<p>There are a number of extensions/applications/webapps that can duplicate the traditional desktop experience. Some, like the New York Times are really nice. Simplenote in Chrome is just like any other browser. Some ""webapps"" are just bookmarks. Like Mint. TweetDeck is nice and runs well but I never was a big fan of it in general.<p>The free 100mb of 3G courtesy of Verizon has been a lifesaver because honestly, either the software or hardware will drop WiFi and require turning the machine off and on to get it back. And without the Internet, the experience isn't so hot.<p>The mediocre:<p>Having been spoiled with a Macbook the trackpad on the Cr-48 isn't very responsive and doesn't even handle two fingered scroll well. I don't fault Google on that - it's a free laptop with minimal hardware, it's just a frustration, not a ChromeOS issue. (likewise the screen isn't the best, but again, hardware not software. the real devices should be better)<p>Sometimes I really want to have an application separate and even opening a new window doesn't make it feel that way. You have to remember it's just a browser. The clock app is a large box that pops up similar to a Gmail notification. I think a little more start menu/taskbar like behavior as part of the Chrome interface would be nice.<p>The filesystem is a pain. You don't usually need to access it, but when you do it feels like you are in the wrong place. Integrating say, Dropbox would be fantastic. Sync a few files to the SSD but most stay in the cloud. And the user wouldn't ever have to see Unix style folder structures.<p>The bad:\nThe Cr-48 looks like a laptop. It has a webcam, a full keyboard, USB and even VGA. But unless rooted it is not a laptop. It is just a web browser.<p>Trying to keep in mind that the Cr-48 is not the hardware ChromeOS will always use is tricky. Had I loaded it onto my laptop I probably would have quit using it after a day or so. I honestly really like having a small, light, fast browser in that form factor that can also do serious typing.<p>I don't consider, even after months of use, the iPad to be good for long periods of typing. Even with a bluetooth keyboard it is an awkward experience. The Cr-48 doesn't have that issue. It feels like any other laptop while typing.<p>The problem with the Cr-48 is that I can't imagine when I would purchase a device similar to it. Not as a second laptop. And I wouldn't make it my primary machine supported by an iPad or other tablet and a smartphone to divide my computing time.<p>Google TV is running Android right? And it has Chrome in top of that. Why not do the same thing here? Why have ChromeOS and not just Android running Chrome with the webapp store? People will get used to webapps without having a cloud-only computer. If Honeycomb had Chrome instead of the standard Android browser I don't see why Google couldn't toss it into something with a keyboard that looked like a laptop but was really just tablet/smartphone guts without a touchscreen. Even dualcore capable Gingerbread would be more than enough to replace the Cr-48 in execution.",1297530289

So forcing a sale wouldn't really change the economics of the situation in the way you're thinking.<p>Who would buy though? The cars gain new parts on a race-by-race basis - they're never line production vehicles so there'd never be a stock of parts available to support them.

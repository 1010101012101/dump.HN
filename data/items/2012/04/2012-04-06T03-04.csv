Those ""tabs"" that look a bit big are not usually ""dead space"". In Microsoft-developed apps (Office and Music, for example), the tab titles slide up and away as you go through vertical content. So all that's left is the logo at the top.
I've been using a LG Optimus for a year now, and I've never felt that the interface was cramped, so maybe it just looks odd to a non-user.",1333684790
3805927,comment,3805635,3805862,4,0,zmmmmm,,,">  I've always kind of liked the metro look but does it have to take up so much space?<p>This has actually been a well known criticism of WP7 that goes under the name ""low information density"".  People counter that by saying it's a feature, not a bug.<p>For me, it creates a problem because every time I pick up a WP7 handset it feels like a feature phone.  The nicest feature-phone I ever held, but it still has this limited, focused, prebaked feel that I find hard to explain but which exactly reminds me of the same feeling I get with feature phones.  I think the smart phone market is very much an aspirational one where people expect to feel like they're stepping into the future, and WP7 just doesn't feel like that.  As much as everyone praises iOS for it's polished and slick nature, that's not actually why people are buying phones (and also why Android succeeds in spite of having missed the polish).  They are trying to empower themselves with something more advanced than their previous phone which probably already had things like a facebook widget and weather app, etc.",1333684775

You have chosen to rank based (I presume) on incoming links on CrunchBase. However, this is intrinsically no more impartial than a ranking based on yearly revenue, or number of employees, or size of their offices, number of mentions in the New York Times, or any other of an unbounded number of metrics.<p>I would argue that PageRank, while it may have done a good job of ranking websites for the purposes of search, is a pretty poor choice here. It's highly susceptible to reporting bias, where some companies will be better-represented on CB. Empirically, you also get weird artifacts, like the ranking of MySpace ahead of Apple.<p>Choosing a good metric requires a theoretical explanation of why that metric is important and why it helps answer your question (which you don't state, but I suspect is something like, ""which are the most important startups"", whatever that might mean). Just choosing <i>something</i> doesn't necessarily tell you anything useful.<p>[If you're interested in high stakes debates about rankings, look into the hoopla that comes about every year when US News & World Report releases their college rankings. These numbers can have huge effects on college's prestige and, lower down the food chain, their bottom lines.]",1333684732

We assign our level two technicicans to particular customers, and need to find a way to reward them for the proper management of their customers.  I've had thoughts of rewarding them financially for doing a good job.  These thoughts include assigning trouble tickets weights for closing out trouble tickets that are of more difficulty.  Examples include closing out basic calls such as fixing a printer issue for low weight, or fixing a group policy issue for higher weight.  Then once a quarter or so, we evaluate what the technician has earned via the volume of weight (not in pounds) that they have gained during that period to mean some sort of value that they have earned.  It's a double edged sword as this means nothing if they are closing out tickets prematurely or taking tickets of higher value instead of handling smaller issues of less value first just so that they can get more accumulated weight.  Does anyone have a good strategy for providing financial, or any other meaningful incentive, for getting your technicians to do a better job?  Any help is appreciated.",1333684503

3805902,comment,3805635,3805831,2,0,jordhy,,,"You're also missing something called economies of scope. Consider the following:<p>1. Apple can make a lot of money of an iPod Touch since they have many content partnerships in place and the cost of production of these devices is nominal (Apple has dedicated factories, has been producing the same models for years and, thru the Apple Store, enjoys low marketing and distribution costs).<p>2. Google's and Microsoft's breath of content partnerships is not as broad as Apple, therefore they wouldn't make as much money per device sold.<p>3. Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch share many components, production and distribution facilities; lowering the total cost of unit production and distribution for Apple.<p>4. Apple's customers are very accustomed to a single particular line of design. This makes it easy for Apple to push a model and it also makes it easy for developers to produce apps for the platform. In this case Android's fragmentation would get rapidly compounded and make developers lives harder.<p>5. Microsoft and Google have partnerships with phone manufacturers whose designs differ significantly. Therefore the traction of a particular design can't be directly translated into a media player (because only a thin slice of the market is familiar with the product).<p>6.  Microsoft already failed with the Zune, so there are some cultural issues there as well.<p>7. Google makes money on search which is not a fundamental (albeit important) use case of a media player. So the monetization numbers for Google are going to look really bad if they were to sell media players.<p>6. This is a very tough market to penetrate since the iPod has so many partnerships in place already (covers, speakers, adapters, even iPod ready cars).<p>All and all, Google and Microsoft have a chance to boost their app stores by competing on different platforms: the TV and game consoles.

If you look at the history of Acer & Asus, for example, you'll see that they both (Asus was actually started by a few ex-Acer engineers) as component suppliers to larger, western OEMs and contract manufacturers.  As they got a foothold there, they expanded their offerings to include more complex manufacturing (motherboards, graphics cards, etc), which they parlayed into a lucrative ODM/JDM business, and then eventually launched their own consumer brands to compete directly with their former customers.  It took a decade+ to get from point A-->B, but by the time they finished the transformation it was too late for the slow western behemoths to do anything about it.<p>And that, as they say, is the rest of the story [of how the global supply chain got Asia-heavy, causing eventual movement of manufacturing & logistics to the region, too].

I'd want to see my brief and have an opportunity to adjust it before letting employers see it. But I imagine that dilutes the meaningfulness of it.

Is rails really that hot? Just starting out with rails now I feel like I'm really late to the party. I'm mostly interested in Clojure, but that's not exactly the hottest job market.<p>It's nice to hear that it really is that good though, It's hard to really get a feel from it living so far from any tech hubs, without many developer friends.",1333681419

They are going to assume the Bravo portrayal is an accurate depiction of Silicon Valley, much like how they assumed <i>The Social Network</i> was an accurate depiction of the beginnings of Facebook.

Basically, you can't judge someone until they have the job. And that isn't possible, so... despite what you are trying to do, you are still hiring ""lucky"" people, and lucky CS grads at that.

3805793,comment,3802767,3802767,1,0,halostatue,,,"The suggested distinction elaborated on between {} and do/end blocks isunfortunate.<p>The block types have different binding precedence, which affects their suitability for fluent (read as ""DSL"") interfaces. The reason that Rake tasks are defined as:<p><pre><code>    task :foo do
      
    end
</code></pre>
and not<p><pre><code>    task :foo {  }
</code></pre>
is not just multi-line readability, it's because {} binds to <i>:foo</i>, but do/end binds to <i>task</i>.<p>Inasmuch as you want to make a different distinction between {} and do/end, Jim Weirich's suggested distinction is as good as any: use {} when you're going to be using the result of the block and do/end when you're not. Therefore:<p><pre><code>    squared = (1..10).map { |i| i * i }
    (1..10).each do |i|
      puts i * i
    end
</code></pre>
Yeah; I'll probably use {} for both because it's more readable in the simple case, but I find that I rarely use do/end when I'm using the value of the block, and I'll almost always use {}.",1333681224

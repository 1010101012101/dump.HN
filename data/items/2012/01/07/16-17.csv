3437369,comment,3436812,3436976,5,0,jcnnghm,,,"My girlfriend is a primary care pediatric nurse practitioner (meaning she can prescribe narcotics, among other things), and always complains that many of the doctors and other NPs she works with prescribe antibiotics even when it is completely unnecessary.  They do this because patients demand them, and if they don't, many patients change doctors.  Antibiotics have no effects on viruses, but patients do not understand that, or refuse to accept it, even when the doctor tells them.  Pharmaceuticals seem to have such a pronounced effect on so many conditions, that people believe they can cure everything.<p>On a side note, I can see why people could become addicted to pain killers.  I was recently hit from behind at about 50MPH, and hurt my back pretty badly.  The doctor prescribed narcotic painkillers and muscle relaxers.  Because my work is highly intellectual, I took them only when the pain was more detrimental than the effect of the medication.  In essence though, the pills are kind of nice.  \nThey are like catching a mild (2-4 beers) buzz that lasts all day, without any nasty side effects like difficulty sleeping or hangovers.  They kind of make you a little more relaxed and a little bit happy, with a slight haze on the brain.  And they are legal and dirt cheap, even without a prescription plan.  If you don't have to think for a living, I can see why you would abuse them.  But they seem mostly harmless overall, would it really be so bad to give people that want them some happy pills?  It's probably trading one substance abuse problem for another, but that would be ignoring the degree.  On the other hand, the only reason I don't smoke weed is because I think it makes people lethargic and complacent, so maybe I'm not the person to ask.",1325955411

3437356,comment,3431107,3431107,1,0,jrockway,,,"I think this problem is a great interview question.  It's easy to describe, and it's easy to get started solving it by writing the first few lines on the whiteboard.  From there, the pattern should be obvious, and once you've recognized the pattern, you only need to write a few lines of code.  The disadvantage is that someone might remember Pascal's triangle from high school math, and will try to ""remember"" the answer instead of actually solving the problem incrementally.  <i>This</i> is worthless because the question is about problem solving ability rather than your memory of exam questions like ""Expand (x+3)^27"" or ""Factor x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3"".  (I do remember writing Pascal's triangle on these sorts of exams, incidentally!)<p>Anyway, reading the other comments in the thread, it seems I am alone in liking this sort of question.  I think these types of questions are good indicators of programmer quality.  Anyone can read a Ruby on Rails tutorial and make an application that stores some records in a database.  It doesn't take understanding to do that, it takes practice.  That's all very good, as long as you're sure that your work will only be repeating what you've practiced rather than developing new skills.  I think that programming work is very rarely like that.  Yes, your job involves Ruby on Rails, but it's largely about solving some sort of complicated problem and then hooking the answer into your UI.  Your experience with Rails will speed up the UI work, but if you aren't willing to understand and solve problems, you'll never have anything to put in the UI.  (The people that can only do the UI part are ""code monkeys"" and don't get paid very well.)<p>If you think that you'll never need to understand problem X, it's simply because you are unwilling to understand problem X.  Once you understand graphs and algorithms and data structures, you'll see how you can apply your understanding to write better software. You might not think they're very important, but that's because, right now, you have no idea of how those techniques might be important.  Learn them and <i>then</i> come back and say ""everything in CS class is garbage"".  You won't, because it's not.  Your job will be easier and you won't be navigating the waters blind.<p>So I guess my point is: algorithm questions are good.  There are a lot of programmers who can't solve problems (but can monkey code), and if you want the best programmers, you want the ones who can both solve problems AND write code.",1325955001

I'm simply stating the fact that distribution as a business model is dead in the face of unlimited, near-costless sharing of data. It's really the same as with the burden of proof for the need for copyright: it's the task of the ones demanding a business model to find one. Not ours to provide you with one.<p><i>>Copyright still serves a very useful purpose and is far from evil in and of itself.</i><p>That's your opinion and I do not share it.

But if you are actually serious about founding a business, I would suggest you do not hire your 12 males in their twenties right in the beginning, instead, you hire a few people you actually _want_ to work with, and pay them a decent salary.\nAnd pay the taxes, as high as they are.

It seems that modern open-world RPGs (Skyrim, for instance) have opted for larger and more elaborate worlds at the expense of enemy variety. This is probably the result of the ""territory race"" that has been taking place in the genre for well over a decade now: each new RPG is expected to have a world twice as big as the last. The player's sense of novelty, and of world scope, is more easily cued by landscape (""room"") variety than by enemy variety -- and so, focusing resources on landscape variety usually yields better payoffs.<p>Even still, I can't help feeling that something has been lost along the way. While I am extremely pleased with the immensity and variety of modern-day world maps, I <i>do</i> notice the emptiness of them, or the repetition of NPC and enemy types.

3437263,comment,3434807,3435735,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"Level 9 is a war of attrition between the player and the dungeon. The dungeon is intentionally designed with a lot of non-critical areas in order to get the player lost, so that he'll run across more sets of enemies, and eventually be ground down to a point of insufficient resources (health, potions, ammo, etc.) to complete the level. In this sense, beating Level 9 is really an exercise in efficiency, rather than the free-roaming exercise of exploration that carried the player through previous dungeons.<p>There's also a very subtle psychological dimension at play in Level 9. By the time the player gets to Level 9, he is so used to random exploration, bombing of random walls, discovery of secret areas, and so forth, that his natural instincts are to bomb every wall and explore every room. It's precisely these inclinations that will land him in trouble in Level 9. Almost every wall is bombable; almost every room seems interesting; almost every path is interconnected. Accordingly, in order to beat Level 9, the player must ""unlearn"" a lot of the behaviors that made him successful, throughout the game, up to that point.",1325952538

It wouldn't make much sense to clone Reddit because it's already open source, but forking it and modifying it would be very appropriate.<p>We wrote four chat servers reminiscent of chat.nodejs.org in batch[1]; one with Brubeck (python), one with Chicago Boss (erlang), one with node.js, and then the Brubeck chat program was rewritten to work inside of a Spotify App, so yes we clone existing projects.

IE compatibility.

YES, in a few years solid-state memory devices will become sufficiently cheap to make distribution a possibility...and people will find ways to complain SS-ROM.

I buy tea and coffee in bulk - another 11 to 25 cents or so. My entire breakfast costs less than 50 cents, and all it requires is boiling water or 3 minutes in the microwave. It's faster than a drivethrough.<p>Rice and beans are practically free they're so cheap. I buy turkey or chicken cold cuts, again very cheap. I buy ""turkey dogs"" (hot dogs, but made of turkey) when they're on sale for something like $2 per six. 3 of them is 210 calories, almost all protein, for about $1. I buy whatever fruit is on sale, fruit isn't so expensive either. I don't like bread, but wheat bread is cheap. My girlfriend sometimes cooks a huge pot of stew that sits on the stove for 3-4 days and serves 10+ meals for under $10.<p>I'm not sure how much eggs are per dozen - maybe a dollar or two?<p>It's possible to eat very quickly and inexpensively.

816279,comment,815528,815768,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Like anyone besides some code junkies here and young soul rebels will give much of a shit about your explanation - they'll just read it and think 'Hmm, he says he spent $x thousand making the film but he doesn't want to spend a grand or two on licensing for release? Whatever, more like he can't get a distributor to take it'. I accept the copy protection and so on is intolerable to you. It's totally your right to avoid patronising or promoting a distribution medium you dislike and the administration of which offends you. And I respect too your right to post about it online, although I don't think your 'fuck blu-ray' approach is going to convince people of anything more than the intensity of your feeling.<p>Look at it from the customer's point of view. They really don't care about you or your worldview in 99% of cases. To paraphrase Dov Simens, nobody says 'let's go see a Sony movie tonight, or would you prefer a Paramount film?'. People care about the distribution company even les than they care about the studio, which to say hardly at all. From a distributor's point of view the licensing requirements and costs to release on blu-ray are trivial operating costs, just like there has always been a fee to use the DVD logo on DVD cases and small fees for use of the MPEG codecs, h.264 codecs etc. OK, so the fee is more expensive with blu-ray. You object, I see your point - it doesn't make economic sense if you expect to sell under 3-5000 copies.<p>I know, you hate distributors. They take a chunk of your money and have overly cosy relationships with theaters and video rental businesses, and this is one reason among many that you market directly. On the other hand, distributors have the funds and expertise to advertise and otherwise promote a film to increase its chances of commercial success, and thus increase your future possibilities for obtaining production financing and having more negotiation power the next time you are looking at a distribution deal.<p>It seems to me that people who might be interested in your film won't be very exercised about the format (not least because 99% of text adventures employed graphics well below the resolution of DVD anyway), and the people who are merely curious rather than enthusiastic about IF etc. are going to read 1 paragraph of your rant and decide you're a computer geek with a chip on his shoulder.<p>Most indies will treat these expenses as just another line item. $3000 to buy a lifetime blu-ray reproduction license? OK, I've been on no-budget projects that racked up similar amounts of money just on beta duplication fees for an eventual release to DVD because the distributor didn't have a digital pipeline. Me, I'd rather pay it and have some chance of getting a review by submitting copies of the movie to every little film magazine/website in hopes that they'd work the 'anyone can release to blu-ray now' angle and promote the damn film...which might even get a wider audience for your (valid) thoughts about the licensing costs involved if you mentioned to an interviewer how filmmakers should be prepared for some sticker shock and it's holding them back.<p>tl;dr valid perspective, but ultimately you're choosing to limit your own distribution.",1252619173

If they transferred those subsidies to produce we could make it significantly cheaper to eat healthy.<p>However, if you are smart it's possible to eat much cheaper than McDonalds and almost infinitely healthier.  The secret is just eat like they do in poor countries.  Start with bulk quantities of some basic staples.  I'm Brazilian, so for me it's rice and beans.  Then buy veggies and meat that are on sale.  Of course if you want it to taste good you have to learn to season and cook it properly, which takes time.<p>I admit that corn syrup drinks, processed carbs and extremely fatty/salty/msg-y food tastes great and can be quite addictive.  I sympathize with people who are stuck in that cycle.

In fact, most independent authors and musicians I know would kill for a transparent, workable DRM system that effectively stopped casual piracy. Without it, 0-day piracy would become ubiquitous. For Hannah Montana that won't matter much because Hannah Montana's shit is going to be bought -- and pirated -- in massive volume anyway. For the local musician it could mean not getting the big break he was hoping for because he didn't cross the threshold of 50,000 or 100,000 albums sold necessary for the record company to heavily market him. In the worst case it means not being able to feed his family with the income from his music.<p>So no, DRM is necessary if you want small independent creators to succeed in the age of the Pirate Bay. And it's not going away anytime soon.",1252617606

I've worked with managed switches from some rather low tier manufacturers like Milan, Allied Telesys, Adtran, etc. that still support MSTP.   MSTP actually isn't that recent.  It was incorporated into 802.1q in 2003, but it was introduced as an amendment to 802.1q in 802.1s way back in 1998.  If you've got gear that doesn't support MSTP (or the Cisco proprietary RSTP), through it out.  Failover and convergence time with original STP is atrociously slow.<p>At any rate, I still don't see this as a STP/VLAN problem.  If you want network redundancy than clearly your redundant links need to carry <i>all</i> of your VLAN's.  Otherwise you'll have redundancy for some VLAN's but not others.  That's not STP's fault, it's just plain logic.<p>Not that I think STP is a great protocol mind you.  It sucks in MANY ways.  Just not in the ways you seem to be claiming it does.   :-)",1252617563

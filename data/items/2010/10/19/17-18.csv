Adding much more would blow out our ability to handle complexity and just be too busy on the screen for anything to make sense.<p>Go look at a language parser sometime; we've actually put a <i>lot</i> of work in any production-ready language into that ""low tech"" text interface. The tree approach is useful for macro writing, and if you don't know Lisp maybe you should go check one out, but I'm very unconvinced there's a better way to actually interact with the code even in theory.

There are just so many good-enough open source programming tools out there.  Commercial tools not only have to better than the open source stuff, they have to be <i>way</i> better.  This is because of all the costs involved with adopting a new IDE:  Not just the price of the software, but the time spent learning a new environment and getting it configured right are significant time investments.<p>So open source eats away at the margins of commercial tools, which leads to less people working on commercial tools, which drives more people to the open source incumbents, etc.<p>I believe pg says open source is bad at design.  That seems right to me.  Open source is good at copying existing tools, but not so good at innovating.

In case I've unfairly summarized the author's point, here's the graf it comes from:<p><i>But contrary to the myth that Guggenheim propounds about “amazing results,” even Geoffrey Canada’s schools have many students who are not proficient. On the 2010 state tests, 60 percent of the fourth-grade students in one of his charter schools were not proficient in reading, nor were 50 percent in the other. It should be noted—and Guggenheim didn’t note it—that Canada kicked out his entire first class of middle school students when they didn’t get good enough test scores to satisfy his board of trustees. This sad event was documented by Paul Tough in his laudatory account of Canada’s Har- lem Children’s Zone, Whatever It Takes (2009). Contrary to Guggenheim’s mythology, even the best-funded charters, with the finest services, can’t completely negate the effects of poverty.</i><p>One might salvage the author's point by saying that it's simply arguing that charters aren't a cure-all; that the disciplinary problems that sabotaged that middle school class are going to exist for any charter, &c.",1287510083

I found this critique pretty devastating, and would be interested in seeing if any HN'ers can knock it down.<p>Here are (I believe all) of the factual arguments presented in the article:<p>* The film admits only 20% of charter schools gets ""amazing results"". In reality, the huge study that stat comes from says only 17% of charters beat public schools, 46% generate comparable results, and 37% are worse.<p>* The film higlights successes but ignores chains of charters with newsworthy mismanagement scandals (real estate scams, embezzlement, religious indoctrination, $300-400k salaries to teach small student bodies).<p>* Since test scores are what determines the perceived value of a charter, some charters expel students just before testing days or have high student turnover, particularly with low-performing students.<p>* The NAEP test the movie relies on for the claim that 70% of 8th graders can't read at grade level says nothing of the sort; the movie distorts the results so that any student scoring less than a B is ""below grade level"", when in fact only 25% are below C, not 70%. The author of the article was a member of the NAEP governing board.<p>* One of the film's heroes, Geoffrey Canada, runs a organization managing two (2) charter schools that is funded to the tune of $200MM, and is paid $400,000; the author of the article is an admirer, but implies that no public school system is similarly well equipped.<p>* In 2010 state tests, 60% of Canada's 4th graders were below ""proficient"". Canada also expelled his entire first middle school class because their scores were too low, which the movie didn't note.<p>* Another charter the movie celebrates, Green Dot's Locke High, took $15MM in funding and got only tiny improvements; only 15% of its students are now proficient in English, up from 13.7%; math rose from 4 to 6.7%.<p>* Another charter, SEED in DC, is successful, but spends 3 times what the average public school spends ($35,000 per student).<p>* Studies appear to show that teacher quality --- while the most important factor within a school --- accounts for only 10-20% of outcomes, while non-school factors account for almost 60% of the outcome.<p>* Americans are dissatisfied with the quality of schools in general, but 77% of them rate their own school A or B.<p>* Finland, the movie's model school system, is entirely unionized, has much lower poverty, and has a stronger social safety net than the US.<p>* While the movie points out that only 0.04% of teachers ever lose their certificate, it omits the fact that 50% of new teachers leave the profession within 5 years, mostly because of working conditions.",1287508788

The first was a drunk that they hired off the street (seriously, the administration not believe us until we found an empty whiskey bottle in the back cupboard).  They replaced her the second quarter with a flighty woman who didn't understand the material and regularly lost our assignments and tests; some time after they fired her I saw an article in the variety section of the local paper showing her in her home, back to the camera, with her hands on her hips staring at the massive pile of junk in her house—it was an article about ADHD adult packrats.  For the final quarter they put us in a real chemistry teacher's class, where none of us were at all prepared having learning nothing for the first 2/3rds of the year, and they had to just give us the credit for the year.<p>The point of this anecdote is that there were plenty of smart, motivated students in this class, but the teachers made it impossible to learn, so the performance of everyone was equalized to the lowest common denominator.  The only people who learned anything were the ones willing to read the book for its own sake without any guarantee of proper labs or tests.  The next year I got into the physics class of a teacher who was widely regarded as the best in the school.  We learned a lot in that class, but even there you had problem kids who refused to make any effort, despite the fact that the teacher clearly cared about the students; they saw him as someone to be taken advantage of.<p>So you see, neither factor stands alone. You need decent teachers, and you need kids to show up.",1287508244

1807840,comment,1806548,1806893,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"At the vm-local level (i.e., not fork -> process memory COW, but rather immutable & persistant objects), you can make objects immutable via their metatables: set __index and __newindex to functions that do proxying. The former would lookup fields from the appropriate object instance, and the latter would set the (internal) object reference to a new copy with the updated field.<p>Come to think of it, that's almost a direct Lua translation of what you said: <i>""In VisualWorks Smalltalk, I'd just start off by setting objects immutable and using a top-level exception handler on the mutation exception. Alternatively, one could also use forwarder proxies.""</i> The __newindex metatable field is a mutation hook and __index is like doesNotUnderstand. (Lua seems more like Self than Smalltalk, though.)<p>But, I don't think I'd do it that way - when going for immutable & message-passing semantics, adding syntactic sugar to make it look like stateful OOP seems misleading to me. You can stream plain Lua tables* over sockets pretty easily, though, so message-passing is probably much simpler. You can stream Lua functions, but not coroutines. (Streaming functions with closures takes a bit of debug API hackery, though.)<p>* Lua tables are almost identical to JSON.<p>FWIW, there's a port of Erlang's message-passing concurrency and supervision hierarchy programming model to Lua: ConcurrentLua (<a href=""http://concurrentlua.luaforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concurrentlua.luaforge.net/</a>). I've only toyed with it a little bit, since I didn't really know Erlang at the time. It uses co-operative multitasking (coroutines), has localized mutable state (doesn't force modify-once variables within processes), and doesn't have selective receive (yet, though I keep meaning to add that). I'd rather just use Erlang for fault-tolerant-server projects (possibly w/ Lua behind ports), but it seems like a good library for distributed programming in Lua.",1287508161

You could launch the blue bird such that it falls just to the right of a standing piece of wood and ""explode"" it just as it's right next to the wood.

The dirtier the code is, the more you try to keep the same guy on it.  You hesitate to commit him to any other projects if there's even a prospect of needing him to work on ""his"" code.  Programmers love that shit, especially the ones who write dirty code.  It makes them feel smart, important, and indispensable (which unfortunately they are.)  Plus, nobody is going to be looking over their shoulder gasping and saying ""no wonder it's always broken!"" because nobody else wants to get their brain dirty in that code.  If you're a bad coder, taking ownership of your own crappy applications is your ticket to escaping peer review and protecting your job.<p>By contrast, the most vital and hard-core piece of C++ code we have at my company has had contributions from almost half the C++ developers we've employed, thanks to a great initial design and good stewardship.

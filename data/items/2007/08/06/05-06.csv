39713,comment,39699,39708,0,0,rms,,,"Try some melatonin. You can buy it at any drug store with the vitamins.  It comes in 1mg or 3mg size, most doctors only recommend the 1mg size but there's nothing wrong with the 3mg size if you don't make a habit of it.<p>Even if you do make a habit of it, some anecdotal evidence shows it is good for you.<p>It also has a side effect of giving you extremely vivid or even lucid dreams.",1186379368
39712,comment,39655,39706,0,0,mynameishere,,,"The dictionary is the wrong place to look for discussion on property. It's a complicated subject, and I'm trying to squeeze it into as few words as possible. If you want a citation:<p><i>In a private property system, property rules are organized around the idea that various contested resources are assigned to the decisional authority of particular individuals (or families or firms)</i> <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/</a><p>...In short, it is a matter of ""use"" (decision) rather than possession. A copyright indisputably is owned by all creators unless surrendered. But the copyright itself codifies control over a work, and thus is not <i>that which is lost</i> but <i>that which proves loss</i> in matters of IP violations.",1186378381

39709,comment,39655,39707,0,0,palish,,,"Okay.  Is your argument about semantics?<p>I'm fine with renaming the act, but I have no idea what to call it.  Do you have a suggestion?  Just ""illegal copying"" perhaps?<p>Also, do you feel the law should punish the act as if someone had shoplifted an item of equivalent value, or some other punishment?  I'm worried that if the punishment is a fine, people might risk it anyway because the chance of getting caught seems so small in peer to peer networks.",1186377276

I've done all-nighters, but when I'm refreshed I get more done in a couple of hours than I do in a whole day when I'm tired.<p>Unfortunately I sometimes get bouts of insomnia... anyone have good tips on how to cure that?",1186377122

39706,comment,39655,39693,0,0,paul,,,"The dictionary doesn't seem to include your second definition, but regardless, you would NOT be preventing him from determining the use of his property, because his property is the copyright, and he can still use it any way he likes.",1186376828

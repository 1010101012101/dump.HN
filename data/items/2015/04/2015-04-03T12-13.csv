9315557,comment,9314000,9315261,0,0,taliesinb,,,"First, let&#x27;s explode the idea of parity: German median income is almost twice that of Greece. Greeks work longer and have fewer holidays. The average age of Greek retirement is actually <i>higher</i> than Germany&#x27;s. <a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/world-affairs/2012/05/exploding-myth-feckless-lazy-greeks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/world-affairs/2012/05/expl...</a> for more of the same.<p>So already the popular notion that hard-working Germans tax-payers are actually paying for those lazy, feckless Greeks is wrong. It also has nasty racist and fascist undertones, but let&#x27;s put that aside.<p>Furthermore, it gets the causality backwards: the labor rollbacks and public cuts inflicted on German workers <i>created</i> the surplus that German banks speculatively invested in dubious Greek enterprises and Spanish construction projects in the 2000s.<p>Broadly, through the 2000s, Germany embraced neoliberalism, labour got squeezed, profits shot up, and a surplus accumulated. That surplus then needed a place to invest.<p>Those investments went to, among other dubious places, the (famously) fiscally irresponsible Greek government and corrupt Greek enterprises.<p>But investment isn&#x27;t aid, of course. There&#x27;s no gift. German banks were betting on a return when they loaded Greece and other countries up with debt. Of course a creditor nation also enjoys many political privileges over its debtors, so German politicians were happy, too.<p>Better yet, that same capital flow was being recycled back into German manufacturing by inflating demand for German exports from those countries! Living beyond their means often meant buying German goods! A giant circulation machine had formed that helped the Germany economy nearly double in 10 years.<p>In 2008, the slow slide of Italy, Spain, Greece, etc. into the status of &#x27;debtor nations&#x27; was brought to a halt by the liquidity crisis. Everyone stopped fantasizing about endless debt-fueled growth. Germany banks and the ECB became more cautious. The circulation halted, and the Greek, Spanish, Italian economies, which distorted by malinvestment and terrible bubbles, collapsed.<p>Now we see the vulturism of austerity. You know, at one point in 2012 Germany actually proposed replacing the Greek budget and tax functions wholesale -- what else of a country&#x27;s polity is left? That&#x27;s economic occupation.<p>So, to sum up, we have the perverse situation where the banks which caused the crisis are being bailed out by the citizens of a country whose economy was wrecked by the same capital flows the banks mishandled! The Germans citizens aren&#x27;t bailing out the Greeks citizens. The Greek citizens are bailing out the German banks that lent money to corrupt Greek politicians, by endlessly renewing all that toxic debt that rightly should be written off.<p>Of course, this should sound familiar, because it happened first in the US in 2008. Again, banks won, ordinary people paid dearly.<p>Beware the narrative about Germans paying for Greek mistakes. It&#x27;s wrong, quite disgustingly wrong, and the truth is almost the exact opposite.",1428065572

The proliferation of adblocking and incognito browsing is going to do marked damage to advertising networks like DoubleClick because the loss of demographic targeting means they are forced to basically become run-of-site ad outlets.  Additionally, the amount of fraud in the ad views and click rates has become far more obvious to advertisers over the last 18 months and will only increase as sites try and game the revenue to make up for ad blocking.  This does not bode well for the traditional ad model that has prevailed on the Net for the last 15+ years.<p>I suspect that Facebook becomes the real winner in this due to the fact that no one uses the site without logging in, has provided enormous amounts of targeting info, and with Facebook controlling the ad experience they cut out the likes of Doubleclick and deal directly with the advertisers.  They&#x27;re vouching for the legitimacy of the ad performance metrics and handling the targeting internally using their own data, and so will be able to command a huge premium.  A few years ago I would&#x27;ve laughed at the idea that Facebook would be able to compete with Google in the ad revenue market, but I&#x27;m not laughing now.",1428064928

Although coding involves inspiration, like science, engineering, or mathematics, the crucial distinction is that art exists to --communicate-- a certain set of mental experiences from the artist to the spectator. Art is a form of communication through a combination of direct and indirect means to convey a set of complex, rich, nuanced mental experiences from the brain of one person to many others. The more reducible the communication is to a direct statement, the less &#x27;artistic&#x27; it is; simply because art exists as a channel to communicate those experiences that are too complex and rich for logical statement.<p>So again in my opinion, while coding involves ingenuity, creativity, technical skill, and intelligence the product -- i.e., code -- is an unambiguous logical statement akin to a philosophical syllogism, perfectly expressible and intelligible by regular communication. It does raise the tricky question of the relationship between &#x27;creativity&#x27; and &#x27;art&#x27;, as normal non-artist human beings frequently apply creative thinking without producing art (or shall we say, without producing &#x27;fine art&#x27;).",1428064114

Early computer displays were typically point plotting devices, meaning, these were random access displays like vector displays, but had no memory and would plot individual blips on the display. (Moreover, these displays used high-resolution tubes originally manufactured for use in radar displays, employing a dual P7 phosphor that wouldn&#x27;t only add stability to the image by its sustain/afterglow, but also added iconic trails to any moving objects.) Thus, early games, like Spacewar!, would employ two different modes of graphics: Once, vector like graphics, drawing lines by advancing plotting locations by not more than a screen co-ordinate a step, and on the other hand, painting effects by individual pixels, like the pixel-dust of exploding particles.<p>These displays were also the most limiting factor in game development. As the beam had to be moved at high speeds, displays were serious pieces of hardware, applying high voltages to address the requested plotting locations. In order to prohibit any resulting ringing and blurred images, there was a wait time required in between individual plotting commands. In case of the DEC PDP-1&#x27;s Type 30 CRT used for the original Spacewar!, these were 50 microseconds, the equivalent of 10 internal CPU instructions. Provided the program had to repaint the screen in reasonable time in order to maintain a stable image and steady frame rates, the time spent in display routines contributed a significant amount to the runtime of the main loop and limited what could be done during a frame.",1428063567

I think the author is mistaken and using a lot of assumptions to justify a very bigoted position.<p>Firstly, most children are not capable of making good choices for themselves. This is essentially why we teach them, if they came out of the ground fully aware and able to rationalise there would be no need for schools. My direct experience is that some children are quite self directed and can be left to pursue their interests and work around topics in their own way. Most children however find a lack of direction quite daunting and will end up not working at all if they are not given quite clear instructions.<p>Secondly, allowing each child to pursue their education in their own preferred mode is unreasonable because of class sizes. I have found it very difficult to support more than 5 or so children who are all doing different things, even if they are focusing on a common subject and broadly similar tasks. The only way for a teacher to reasonably teach a class of 20 to 30 or more is to give them all the same work and teach them all in more or less the same way.<p>The author makes the mistake of assuming his teachers were stupid or mean.

From what I gather Beats are a step up from most headphones non-audiophiles traditionally use, and generally on par with headphones of around 80 bucks. Which is definitely better than kind of earbuds/headphones I and most people tend(ed) to buy who don&#x27;t really think about this kind of stuff.<p>I think the comparison with Apple makes sense, looking at it that way. As a &#x27;technophile&#x27; I used to pay more for my laptop (Dell, at that point) than most people around me. They would work on really crappy laptops, curse how slow or loud or hot they were, but stick with them and not spend a premium on something better. Apple changed that, and made it &#x27;fashionable&#x27; to spend a bit more to get, at the very least, a mid-range laptop. Those who did get one understood the benefits after the fact. Beats are similar. They might not be &#x27;great&#x27; to audiophiles, or worth their money, relatively, but for many people they are the first experience of, at least, decent sound.",1428062544

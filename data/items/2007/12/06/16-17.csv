86673,comment,86506,86609,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"I would be willing to bet you that they have no interest in becoming a service economy.  The US built its power up by having a mighty manufacturing sector - it's what let us build tanks and planes and all the other instruments of war so well in WWII.  Another point to consider is that manufacturing jobs produce many more jobs to support the work than than do jobs in the service industry.",1196959744

Enterprise software, as I understand it is not intended to be simple to install or use; it's intended to be set up in a custom way every time. The Java language is similarly annoying, requiring lots of boilerplate before you can do any real work.",1196959295

Most projects should probably avoid VMware as otherwise the cost of at least the most basic VMware license gets piled on top of each sale and at ~200USD that can be a significant increase. <p>But in any case it can be a great compromise between the clients issues of data privacy and response time versus the supplier tech support expenditures.<p>Would have upmodded twice if I could :) ",1196957975

86660,comment,86506,86643,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I don't know what to call it -- corruption seems to be the best word for now. For our purposes an academic elite is the same as a political party -- it holds political power.<p>\nWhatever it is, the problem it presents is that there is not a single amount of predictable payments that can be made to create an economic transaction -- it's all up to the whims of the people who are involved. I guess it's possible to predict to some degree if you know all of the players, but there is no competition for doing it another way without the payments -- the same party owns the game, the tables, and all of the cards. I'm no expert either, but it seems that corruption in the states is of such a lesser degree to be of a different type altogether, at least as far as startups go. Likewise, corruption in some third world countries is so bad to make even the most trivial of enterprises fraught with hidden expenditures.<p>\nHere, if I want to make a startup to, say, sell fried chicken on the street corner, I've got 2 or 3 political people to meet and make happy. Now there might be lots of crooks in the local government, but each local government can be of a different political party, as can the state and federal governments. Even in a completely crooked world, that provides incentives for each section of political power to lower corruption, at least in sections controlled by the other guy. You simply do not have that somehow-it-works setup in China. And I think it's going to be a limiting factor in their growth.",1196957258

86658,comment,85761,85805,0,0,zoltz,,,"> You can't really compare the two<p>I'll still try. Both games have a philosophical and a computational side. The chess philosopher could ask questions such as <p>""everyone knows that dominating the centre is an advantage, but WHY EXACTLY is that the case""<p>But even if he understands this better than others, it won't help him that much because chess games are decided on the computational side. This is why you have to start at an early age in order to become a great chess player. And it suits computers.<p>Poker's computational side includes, for example, odds (trivial) and ICM. In most forms of poker, though, it is far outweighed by the philosophical side, at least as of today. The poker philosopher could ask questions such as<p>""everyone knows that being in position is an advantage, but WHY EXACTLY is that the case""<p>If he's willing to work hard on his understanding of the game, he might, in theory, learn the rules at any age and become the world's best poker player in just a few years. Getting direct monetary value from one's philosophical insights is an attractive proposition. Unfortunately there are big psychological drawbacks, which Matt Maroon describes so well.",1196957001

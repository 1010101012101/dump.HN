There was another case which slips my mind at the moment that found similarly (that commercial use doesn't stop it from being fair use).<p>IANAL, and I am not familiar with all of the little details that go into determining whether something is fair use.

The mass of the black hole created equals the amount of mass that falls into it, of course, and to first order the mass of the BH will be equal the mass of the <i>iron core</i> of the star. That mass is however quite a bit smaller than the mass of the star, and very much smaller than the <i>initial</i> mass of the star. (A star has to start out with a mass > 8* the mass of the Sun to go supernova, and that will only guarantee that it forms a neutron star whose mass will be of order 1 Solar mass. The rest is lost first during the life of the star, as massive stars are so luminous they drive their own matter off from the surface, and then ejected in the explosion itself.<p>Edit: The article has a number off, as it states that the black hole has a mass of 15 Solar masses and that the companion is 19 times larger.

2706128,comment,2704991,2705985,1,0,urbanautomaton,,,"Hi athst,<p>Thanks for your comment and questions. We went with ""sportspeople"" because our research showed it was regarded as meaning ""people who do sport"" in the most places - in the UK, for instance, ""athletes"" is often (but not always) interpreted as referring specifically to people who do track-and-field athletics.<p>You're quite right, we're not aiming to be a sports fan site - we're very much focused on the sportsperson/athlete. We're not really a Meetup-for-sports, though (although obviously it's great if our members find new sporting partners on the site, and many have already). In fact a huge amount of interaction is between people who are never likely to meet; a Scot who cycles 100 miles before breakfast encouraging a mother-of-two who's working towards their her 5k, for example. It's been great to see how our users will give motivation freely, no matter what someone's level.<p>On the question of locale-specific Tribes, we certainly have a few of these, and users are welcome to create whatever Tribes they would find useful. We also have event-specific challenges for specific marathons, which are naturally localised. What we've found, though, is that our users seem to respond best to Tribes and Challenges that are globally relevant; things like the get fit without joining a gym Tribe (<a href=""http://tribesports.com/tribes/get-fit-without-joining-a-gym"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tribesports.com/tribes/get-fit-without-joining-a-gym</a>), or the 5 minute plank Challenge (<a href=""http://tribesports.com/challenges/hold-the-plank-pose-for-5-minutes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tribesports.com/challenges/hold-the-plank-pose-for-5-...</a>).<p>You're absolutely right, though, more location-specific resources for users will be a key feature in future, and it's certainly something we'd like to develop further.",1309280111

Tens of USB drives were left around the town over a couple of days as if they had been dropped or forgotten. Each contained a (Windows only) auto-run program that called home, a couple of password protected document files (containing gibberish) so the drives looked like they'd actually been used, and a text file called ""if found please return to.txt"" or similar with an email address and a note asking that this address be contacted if the stick were found lost.<p>I forget the exact numbers and can't find a link to the report at the moment but a fair proportion of them, at least once over the next couple of weeks, ended up getting plugged into a Windows machine on a network that let the call-home happen. At least one of them seemingly got plugged into a machine at a bank branch (presumably they inferred the machine was at a bank from the address the call home request came from) which is somewhat worrying: bank machines that may have access to sensitive information not being locked down at all so the drive could be plugged in and used, the program could run, and the program could access the internet without restriction from that location. A couple of the drives were seen by the server they called home to multiple times, implying that some fools were using the drives as their own without removing any existing information from them. Very few people contacted the email address, so presumably most of the drives that got to phone home once were swiped, wiped, and claimed by their finder (human nature, don't you just love it).<p>Obviously there is no saying what happened to the ones that didn't call home - they were either not found, found and handed in somewhere where they still languish, found and binned, not plugged into a machine configured to allowed the autorun and call-home to happen, or so on.<p>I considered grabbing a bunch of cheap flash drives and repeating the experiment myself in my home town but never actually bothered, mainly because it would mean spending beer money on drives I'd never see again!",1309278595

It's shocking and emotional because of the context, and you're right that it doesn't hold up without it. when FFVII was released, the state of graphics technology made expressing emotion in videogame characters solely through visuals difficult, at least for that 3D style. For some contrast, take a look at the intro of FFX. (I'm personally nowhere as fond of that as VII, but that's another debate) You have no idea who this guy his, who these people and this giant cat man are, but you can get the sense of emotion in that scene without context because the visuals were much, much better. Shiny graphics and audio may not matter if there's no story to hold them up, but they are useful to get a point across.<p>The example I've always use for how gameplay can make a scene more emotional is the end of your first battle in Shadow of the Colossus. You know your main character has been tasked to slay these massive creatures to bring back his dead love, but there's little information about them. It just lumbers slowly into view when you confront it, and what follows next is one of the most tense battles I've played in a videogame. You're clearly outmatched, a young man who barely knows how to swing a sword against this massive moving monolith, but you somehow manage to succeed. Just as you're ready to cheer out in victory as it falls, the game takes a shift. Instead of the triumphant battle theme, the music turns soft and sad, and you watch your foe slowly tumble down. Instead of glory, you feel regret, and your victory now seems like a tragedy.<p>Seeing that in film would be emotional, but it's not some character doing it on a screen. <i>You</i> did this, and <i>you</i> killed this strange and magnificent creature. Was it worth it? There's a similar example in the ending of Metal Gear Solid 3, but I'd rather not spoil the amazing ending of that game (which would generally works as well in film, except that one particular moment).",1309278139

(it was taken down after Warner Bros sent Apple a C&D.)<p>1) Reviews are the most important things when you sell an app. I made the app free for the first week or so until I had about 10 5 star reviews. DO NOT use scammy tactics for fake reviews. Make sure your app is well polished for what it does. If it's not, don't put it in the App Store.<p>2) Review reminders. Basically the user uses the app a few times and they get a notice asking if they would like to review it. Include something like the appirater class. Google that.<p>3) Built-in sharing options for Facebook and Twitter. These should link back to the iTunes page for the app or to a custom site.<p>4) Setup bitly links for each sharing option. This helps in keeping stats about where your app is being talked about.<p>In the first week or so I was getting 3000 downloads a day. When I hit my 10 review goal, I switched to $.99. It's disheartening to see that 3k number drop to 20 the next day, but that's money in your pocket now. For the rest of the month, I averaged 20-30 paid downloads a day.<p>Things not to do:\nThere are lots of stupid people out there. They will leave 1 star reviews because they hear no sound. Their mute is on. Don't get upset about these people.<p>Twitter is great for campaigning. Don't write bots that listen to the stream for people talking about the movie that then follows them and does @Soandso check out my Hangover2 app! Surprisingly, it actually works very well. It ran for about 45 minutes and followed 400+ people. About 50 of them clicked through (bitly again) and I think a few people bought it. However, Twitter banned the account after 45 minutes. So, don't do what I did.<p>Don't write well polished apps that use sound clips from a big upcoming movie.

I would LOVE feedback on the concept and execution of GiftBait and welcome any and all feedback to help me improve and refine the service.<p>[Background]:<p>I have always been frustrated with the way gifts are exchanged. Either:\n1) the guest gets something you don't want = wasted $$$, or\n2) the host asks* for over-priced items that guests grudgingly have to buy = poor form.<p>[Concept]:<p>GiftBait's approach is a happy hybrid of the two. It allows the host to create an event and invite guests. Guests sign in and submit gift ideas. The host gets to see ALL the gifts that get suggested but the names of the guests do not get revealed. They can then like/dislike the gifts and the guest gets notified of their decision.<p>[The Value Proposition]:<p>The guest gets to spend only their budgeted amount on the gift and the host gets a huge selection of gifts to choose from. It also gets guests and the host engaged in the whole process which can be fun on its own.<p>[Known Challenges]:<p>Wish lists are engrained in the North American psyche and overcoming this with a guest-generated list of gifts that the host will choose from will require time and effort to get people comfortable with the concept.<p>I'm not sure as yet how many people would pay for such a service. Evite would be a complementary service and despite its popularity it remains a free service.<p>[Product Positioning / Promotion]:<p>I am positioning the service at the moments as a gift wish list that can be relevant to any and all events (e.g., weddings, birthdays, house warming, etc.). I want to see if this has traction, else I will attempt to narrow and focus on a specific industry, e.g. only weddings.<p>To promote, I have reached out to blogs in the events space (e.g. weddings, novel gifts, etc.). I have also considered offering free GiftBait accounts to such blogs as contest prizes...this would likely get some promotion and result in a win-win partnership with the blogs.<p>[My Humble Ask]:<p>I would love feedback on the concept and execution. How should I price this (currently it's $1.99 per event hosted or $9.99 for unlimited events)? Or should this be marketed as a free service with revenue through referral sales, advertising, etc.?<p>Thank you for your time. All feedback would be helpful. I set out to solve for a personal pet peeve but I realize this might not be as big a deal for others.<p>* Interestingly, many cultures find the North American concept of asking or specifying gifts they like to be very offensive. Asian cultures often go with the ""you don't need to get anything for the party, or whatever you get will be awesome...(or at least I will pretend like it's awesome!)"".",1309277946

It must have been because I didn't play the game.  If that scene affected you at all (if it looked like anything but cheesy crap animated with expressionless plastic dolls) it was because you were prepped <i>by playing the game</i> to experience that scene in a particular way.  You can watch a clip of ""La Strada"" or ""Midnight Cowboy"" or ""Unforgiven"" or ""Casablanca"" out of context and at least get a sense of the emotional dynamics of the characters.  That's the strength of movies.  The strength of games is the immersion and feeling of personal involvement with the characters, personal involvement driven by your own actions, choices, and sacrifices.  I may have felt like Ratso Rizzo was my friend, but I never picked up a john to get money for a bus ticket for us to leave town together.  I may have shared Rick Blaine's feelings as he put Victor and Ilsa on the plane to Lisbon, but I didn't <i>decide</i> to do that.  It just happened to me.<p>Games will always be second-rate next to movies when it comes to presenting scripted drama, but they don't have to feel that way.  Aeris and Sepiroth is proof of that, I guess.  Gameplay allows games to affect us in ways that movies can't and enables different and stronger emotional contexts for experiencing games as art.  The art of games is in the gameplay.  Detaching from gameplay is just a crutch, like filming a stage production, copying another art form because we don't understand the new one well enough yet.",1309277294

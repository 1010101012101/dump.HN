1946307,comment,1946075,1946075,0,0,tptacek,,,"People are having a hard time understanding how this could be happening. Perhaps these people don't get out much. What's happening here is simple: the federal government is using Civil Asset Forfeiture for IP/copyright enforcement.<p>Particularly when armed with a court order, the government has broad authority to seize property that can either be traced to the proceeds of a crime, or that can be shown to be used in furtherance of a crime. This comes up <i>all</i> - <i>the</i> - <i>time</i> in drug enforcement, where the police use it to seize vehicles used to run drugs. All that appears to be happening here is that the government is applying it to copyright enforcement.<p>The Libertarian magazine Reason has been covering the increased use (and misuse) of civil asset forfeiture for years now. It ticked up during the Bush years, and has been validated multiple times during the Obama presidency.<p>In particular, note that there <i>are</i> due process protections with strict statutory timelines attached to them for challenging civil seizures. One doubts many of these enterprises will avail themselves of those procedures; most would probably lose, and it's simpler just to host offshore.<p>""Why, oh why, is DHS and ICE doing the RIAA's work for them?"" Because it's part of their charter. The ""C"" in ICE stands for Customs. Customs deals with counterfeiting (it's an importation issue), and hosts a large IPR enforcement division. No, the RIAA has not wheedled its way into DHS and refocused homeland security on copyright enforcement.<p>Civil asset forfeiture can get very sketchy. I wish there were more bright-line limitations on what the government can and can't do with it. The impression that I have is that in the majority of cases where it's applied, you generally want LEO's to have the power to seize what they're seizing. But every once in awhile, they pull some 60 year old guy over with the cash down payment he was going to make for his new pickup truck, declare him a drug dealer, and end up pocketing the cash because he can't find a lawyer. <i>That's</i> a miscarriage of justice. In light of it, I have a hard time feeling too sorry for people who lose their pirate music storefront sites.<p>I like 'daeken (I work with him!), and I know and respect that he has a very different take on intellectual property than I do, but his take on this seems a bit breathless.",1290905704

1946296,comment,1946075,1946272,0,0,jerf,,,"It would help somewhat if, when such a movement actually does arise, people paid a little less attention to the smears put out there by leadership of the government, and the part of the media that fancies itself part of the government, and paid more attention to the actual content of the movement, or perhaps even translated the movement to its own side.<p>Yes, I'm talking about the Tea Party, and let me not be subtle: If you think the government is corrupt and the people need to rise up and everyone is just in everyone else's pockets, then you believe what those exact same powers and people say about an actual public uprising, maybe you need to reconsider how effective your very-justified cynicism actually is. Perhaps even consider that the cynical idea that there is nothing you can do to change things is actually part of the package you are being fed. Yes, you may not agree with <i>everything</i> about the Tea Party, or even hardly anything other than the fact we could use a serious house cleaning, but maybe less time listening to the siren call of blind partisanism and those who use it to manipulate your opinions and more time spent cleaning up the left side of the house would be a more productive response.<p>(Hint: You don't actually have to believe the Tea Party is a uniform bunch of racist homophobic ignorant buffoons to disagree with them on some issues. You can simply... disagree. It's really quite easy when you get used to it. Then you can actually consider your own opinions in an environment where you don't have to constantly be testing them against an artificial standard of bugabooism erected by the dominant power structure to confine your thinking in just that way. You can believe in universal health care and the importance of welfare and social justice and <i>still</i> think it's time to clean out some incumbents and spend more wisely, even perhaps less overall, even if taxes still need to be raised.

It's a non-profit that operates independently under a board of directors, and it's mandate comes from a Memorandum of Understanding which set up a relationship between ICANN and the U.S. govt. However, it still appears that ICANN is under the authority of the U.S. govt., although it is formally a non-profit corporation in California. I mean it's under U.S. authority sort of in the same way that the Bush administration could press telecoms to illegally wiretap communications at Folsom St. in San Francisco and elsewhere. Now, that warrant-less wiretapping was blatantly unconstitutional, because legally protected privacy was breached. However, these domain seizures are different, because nobody is guaranteed the right to use domain names; it's more of a privilege like driving. People don't have the ""right"" to drive cars. That's a privilege granted by states, and subject to their regulations and laws. If a person applied for a license and stated they only wanted to drive so they could rob banks and get away faster, I'm guessing they could be legally denied the license, no court case needed. Well, this appears to be a similar issue. It would make these seizures look like less of an overreach by the DHS.<p>The issues around DCMA are something different to address. I'm strictly talking about this domain seizure issue, and the claim of unconstitutional censorship. That may not be an accurate claim at all. It may be that we need to ensure ICANN is out of the jurisdiction of the U.S. govt.",1290904472

1946237,comment,1945449,1946168,0,0,earl,,,"Hadoop is extremely complex to do anything requiring communication.  My favorite example is ranking: say you have a set of <set (string), id (string), score (float in [0,1])> tuples and for each unique class, you want to rank ids by their scores.  This is trivial on a single core.  Now try doing it on hadoop: first thing you'll do is try to do it all on the head node, but that won't work if you're doing this on more than a trivial amount of data.  Next you may try partitioning by score, but scores aren't distributed uniformly.  Partitioning by set won't work since you have more data than a single node can possibly handle.<p>It took me a week's worth of work to write a distributed ranker that will work on billions of ids in hundreds of sets; the algorithm is not obvious.  On a single node you'd write a for loop that did a sort.<p>Those are the sort of obstacles that the hadoop programming model introduces.  Again, if you haven't used it for real work, you'll be surprised at how few tasks are truly parallelizable without communication.  The model is very simple, but accomplishing tasks that don't quite fit in the model is difficult.<p>Another example is a matrix mult.  There is no way to segment the data to eliminate internode communication.  It can be accomplished in an iterative fashion, but it's decidedly nontrivial.  Or most optimization problems -- I don't think there even are known algorithms for no communication parallelization.",1290903141

CVE-2011-2212, 1751 and 1750 are serious, but mitigated in various ways making actual exploitation difficult (and conspicuous). selinux will mitigate it even further.<p>Remember that all of these fixes are upgrades to userspace - which means there are many more upgrade options than if they were kernel or hypervisor (think the equivalent of a live migrate to the same host, as an example).<p>Btw, Brightbox happened to be the original reporters of CVE-2011-0011 :)",1314050395

2914319,comment,2913961,2913961,2,0,eridius,,,"Garbage article.<p>> Repair/Fix Permissions<p>Terrible advice. There is a very small number of problems which Fix Permissions is the appropriate solution, and ""slow boot times"" is not one of them. In some rare cases it can actually hurt (generally only when you have a badly configured installer package that modifies files used by other packages though).<p>> Clear Caches<p>If anything, that will increase boot time as the caches need to be regenerated. Caches are called caches for a reason.<p>> Select a startup disk<p>This one confuses me. How did you end up with no startup disk? I imagine that if your real OS is the first drive in the system than this will have zero effect. If your first drive is a slow drive that doesn't contain an OS, I can imagine that this might do something, as the system will have to ping each drive to find an OS, but that's just speculation. I still don't know how someone would lose their startup disk though, and I doubt this will affect anyone reading this article.<p>> Free Some Disk Space<p>Reasonable advice in general, but I don't see how it's related to boot times.<p>> Lose the GM seed<p>Useless advice. IIRC the GM seed was build 11A511, which is the same build that was released to consumers. In other words, the GM seed is identical to the App Store version. Installing the app store version on top of the GM seed is a waste of time.<p>> Do a Fresh install<p>Reasonable suggestion in the face of a number of issues, but I don't see why this would affect boot time unless you had a number of daemons installed system-wide and set to launch at startup (and in that case you probably have a reason to have those installed).",1314050366

2914303,story,,,1,0,jasonfiorini,"Personal Training NYC Best Personal Trainer NYC",http://www.hardbodiespersonaltraining.com,"As you go about setting up your workout program, you might start to wonder how to get bigger legs. Leg training is going to be a critical aspect of your overall workout design because the legs are such large muscles in the body and will really have an influence on your testosterone release.
Personal training NYC says the more testosterone you can naturally have flowing through your blood, the faster you will build muscle, so giving your legs a hard work out a few times a week will help promote better growth all over the body.
Here are three key things to know about getting bigger legs.
Perform At Least Two Major Lifts per Workout
The first thing to remember about how to get bigger legs is that the more muscle fibers you can work with an exercise, the better. So for example rather than focusing your program around leg extensions and hamstring curls, focus the majority of your program around squats and dead lifts.
Personal trainer NYC you will also be able to lift more weight using these movements, which is another critical factor thats required for building big leg muscles  a constant increase in load over time.
Keep Compound Work In The Lower Rep Range and Isolated Work In The Higher Rep Range
The second thing you must know about how to get bigger legs is that for your lower body workouts, you should aim to mix up the rep ranges slightly. This increases the variability of the stimulus the muscles have to face, further promoting growth.
Since lifting a higher amount of weight will call for you to use a lower rep range and the opposite applies for the higher rep range, use 4-8 reps total when doing your squats, dead lifts, leg presses, and step-ups, while using the 8-12 rep range when doing lunges, leg extensions, hamstring curls, and calf raises.
Allow For More Rest than With Upper Body Training
Finally, many people who are asking the question of how to get bigger legs place all of their focus on what they are doing in the gym. Do not overlook the time out of the gym. It is actually then that the muscles will be repairing themselves and when the growth process takes place.
Since the leg muscles are much larger and stronger compared with the upper body muscles, they will require more rest after each workout session. Personal trainers NYC be sure youre not overdoing your leg training and adding in numerous cardio workouts as this will really hinder your progress.
Also, if youre serious about building stronger leg muscles quickly, you should make sure youre taking care of your nutrition as well. While the rest process is taking place you must provide the body with the raw materials it needs to synthesize this new leg muscle.
So be sure you keep these points in mind. By using the right program for your leg training, you will progress much faster than you have before.

Although there are high level abstract programming ideas that are beyond any particular language, the only true way to learn about them in any practical/actionable sense is to program in a language that can express those ideas.<p>It's very hard to understand recursion or closures without  expressing them out through a language. I don't remember who said it 'but programming is understanding.' Likewise how do I know you understand object oriented programming unless you can program idiomatically in an object oriented language like Smalltalk, Self, or Ruby?<p>Or how do I know you can program functionally unless you can program idiomatically in a functional language like Scheme, Haskell, or Erlang and not in some hackish, crude way but idiomatically? But in order to program idiomatically and elegantly in the respective languages requires learning libraries, learn the constraints of the language, its quirks, its opinions,etc.",1314049312

As of today, the country I live in offer very few legal content distribution platform for movies and television shows, and none of them has neither <i>tolerable</i> pricing and acceptable DRM policies nor non-laughable title selection, proper listing & metadatafor example, I would not be able to know in which quality I am renting a movie. Anyway, most of the movies simply do not hit digital distribution.
Physical movie rental is dying quite rapidly for most obvious reasons, which means that the few remaining services are starving and offer nothing but the safest-hitting movies.<p>As a remarkably honest biped (who, e.g., bought <i>two</i> Adobe Suite licenses, one for his PC & one for his Mac, and has <i>purchased WinRAR</i>), I am thus being put in the hilariously paradoxical position where not only I am hardly incentivized to legally purchase content, but I am <i>unable</i> to do so. I am <i>struggling</i> to do so, and I can not; this is such a tragicomical condition that my fruitless effort to legally retrieve movies&shows has become a running joke within my circle of friends.
Adding insult to injury, every single major firm persists on sticking to this ridicolously unreasonable regional distribution paradigmwhich adds basically no value even from a job-creation standpoint whereas I would be absolutely happy to throw money at them by purchasing non-localized content.<p>P.S.
To be clear, I live in European first-world country, where the value of the movie market is more than big enough to justify sensible business investments.",1314047968

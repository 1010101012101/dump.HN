77904,comment,77888,77888,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"On the downside, a startup can only make you go broke, while a baby could turn into a serial killer and make you miserable for your entire life. On the upside, a startup can give you money and experience and set you up financially for life. A good kid is another human being that is part of your life's journey, which beats the physical and emotional peaks of being a huge startup success. Having a kid is a very average and pedestrian thing to do, while having a startup is more of a stand-out, brave thing to do.<p>I don't know -- looks like a close call. How about marry a girl with money who won't mind raising the kids by herself while you're out pulling all nighters on the startup?  By the time the kid gets old enough to do stuff with you will have beat the growing pains out of your startup anyway.<p>In all seriousness, doing a startup is an act of ego and ambition. Having a kid is an act of love and selflessness. The motivations, time span, and payoff is so different, I don't think they're comparable.",1194622853

77899,comment,77888,77888,0,0,run4yourlives,,,">I think a better definition for quality of life means experiencing a range of emotions. Is there anything more thrilling, frustrating, exciting and depressing than a startup.<p>Obviously not a parent!<p>I think he's correct to make the choice however. Having a baby considerably alters your focus in the same way that a startup would. If I could, I would have chosen startup first, then baby.<p>By no means though does having a baby make a startup impossible, but it makes it very difficult to focus on.",1194622096
77898,comment,77764,77802,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Most people don't know how to use HD -- certainly a system failure, but also needed info when thinking about what people want. I'm talking about things like cabling and other junk that people have no idea how to properly configure.<p>If I were the MPAA, I would push partnerships between player makers and TV makers. Make it trivial to play super HD content. They should add their own P2P download rental service to schedule movies -- another convenience factor added on. If a TV just worked with super HD, and if it were internet enabled to get the content I want, piracy would significantly decrease. Piggyback on top of FIOS, and you'd have something great.",1194621246

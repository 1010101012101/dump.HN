Towards the end of my time in OO languages I was struck by Reenskaug and Coplien&#x27;s DCI [1] - many people just don&#x27;t model a system&#x27;s use cases as first class concepts. The most important part of a system - what it actually does! - doesn&#x27;t get explicitly mentioned in a lot of people&#x27;s code.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction</a>",1397901561
7613062,comment,7612775,7612775,0,0,vanderZwan,,,"> <i>For maximum performance one would create one large job for each Core of the CPU used.</i><p>Dmitry Vyukov has suggested otherwise in a similar scenario using Go:<p>> <i>If you split the image into say 8 equal parts, and then one of the goroutines/threads/cores accidentally took 2 times more time to complete, then whole processing is slowed down 2x. The slowdown can be due to OS scheduling, other processes/interrupts, unfortunate NUMA memory layout, different amount of processing per part (e.g. ray tracing) and other reasons. [...] size of a work item must never be dependent on input data size (in an ideal world), it must be dependent on overheads of parallelization technology. Currently a reference number is ~100us-1ms per work item. So you can split the image into blocks of fixed size (say 64x64) and then distribute them among threads/goroutines. This has advantages of both locality and good load balancing.</i><p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/CZVymHx3LNM/esYkA_YoB-MJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/CZVymHx3LNM/esYk...</a><p>Or to put it this way: imagine that there was zero concurrency overhead. Then splitting out jobs to their minimal size would be the ideal option, as that would allow for the most smoothed out division of labour where every processor does work all the time and they are all doing work until the entire task is completed.",1397901531

7613048,comment,7612783,7612783,2,0,Monik,,,"You should study &quot;The Algorithm Design Manual&quot; by Steven S. Skiena. It&#x27;s really good and it will teach you what CS students learn in the Algorithms and Datastructures class, including evaluating if the runtime of a program is going to be quadratic, linear, n log n etc. in worst case, best case, average case.<p>You should read a bit about patterns, at least so far that you know what the most common names refer to. One thing is it&#x27;s good for your design and programming, the other is it&#x27;s a tool of communication. You may also like a book about antipatterns.<p>Other than that it depends on what your current programming experience is. E.g. some people develop great non-object-oriented code for years and never really get the concept of OO, if you are one of them try to find a website that teaches OO concepts in terms of one of the programming languages you are fluent in (unless you are and almost certainly will be in an area where OO is completely irrelevant ... stuff close to hardware or something). Or if you e.g. ever only used the little bit of SQL that is enough for many programs (select etc.) you might want to find an SQL tutorial with exercises, skip the parts you already know and get into let&#x27;s say joins, if you never used those before. So in general: Go a little bit further than what you have learned so far by always studying exactly what was needed to get the job done.<p>If, for your previous work, you never used any kind of modeling, e.g. UML, you may want to look into that a little bit - you could miss out on jobs where this is used extensively in the requirements or design documents, e.g. on demand from the customer.<p>Depending on what you have been doing professionally and where you want to go you may want to take a little bit of business/economics classes, like accounting. I hated it like hell when I was studying CS and it was mandatory, but it turned out to be one of the very few things from college that are somewhat relevant for my job.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what people mean by &quot;agile development&quot; or have only a very vague idea, you may want to read up to find out, also on some of the various methods, so that you are not stumped if the topic comes up in a job discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend going out and studying computer science. It will cost you a hell of a lot of money (at least if you&#x27;re in the US) and not teach you a whole lot. So unless you have money lying around and also no problem that you will earn very little for 4 years, in which case you could do it for the fun and experience, it&#x27;s not really worth it for someone who can already program well and gets properly-paid jobs without a degree.",1397900843

What you will get is a lot of answers trying to help but resulting in a lot of noise.<p>Programming is a very wide field. You can choose a lot of different things to learn and specialize. You don&#x27;t need to learn everything now. You have all your life.<p>Now my quota of noise :D<p>Focus on getting a solid background, forget about the languages. Languages come and go. Operating systems too. With a good background you can learn any programming language in &quot;almost&quot; no time. From higher to lower level I would learn:<p>- Algebra (vectors, boolean, sets, etc.).<p>- Algorithms (recursion, tree/graph handling, etc.)<p>- Operating systems theory (resources, I/O, memory and process management).<p>OK, too generic. So, you will need to learn some language to practice your theoretical knowledge. This is what I&#x27;d like to suggest:<p>- At least one systems language (C, etc.) even if you never have to use it.<p>- At least one OO language (C++, Java, Ruby, ...).<p>- An interpreted scripting language is always good to know (Perl, Python, shell, ...).<p>- Bonus: A functional language (Lisp, Haskell, ...). It will make you a better programmer but it will alienate you to the point of seeing other non-functional programmers as low skilled blue-collar workers :P<p>There ain&#x27;t no such things as a &quot;best language&quot;. A programming language suits well to some tasks and not so well to others. Don&#x27;t be a language racist.<p>I will add some non-technical subject to the pack:<p>- Learn how to deal with people. Not everybody is skilled in this field and it is always useful. People is very different and you will have coworkers. Try to create a smooth relationship with them. It will make your life and your coworkers&#x27; life better. A lot of techie guys underestimate this.",1397898850

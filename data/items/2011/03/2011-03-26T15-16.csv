""Shooting an Elephant"", ""A Hanging"" and ""The Spike"" come to mind right away.<p>Slightly less obvious, I'm a big fan of Philip Gourevitch. He's somewhere between a reporter and an essayist. A lot of his essays appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, and a group of them on Rwanda eventually became a book <i>We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families</i>. That is outstanding non-fiction writing.",1301155176

We have become data holics. We like communication and Internet had just made it easier and more accessible. People got addicted to Information and the awesomeness of technology.

In a system with effectively limitless resources this is fine, but in lower specced systems, not so much.<p>Also ""effectively limitless"" means equivalent to the specs of the worst system the designers use, which will likely skew things. Where I'm sitting we share 384K down / 128K up between about 40 people. Updaters that refuse to stop downloading when you close them really bog down the network. Now, you could try and put in some custom menu to control that sort of thing, but that's going to be a mess of configuration and hard choices, and developers will have to do that for every single app.<p>Quit/Close are two well-defined commands that give the user a well defined way to say  when they want something to go away vs. when they want something to go away and quit doing anything. Re-implementing ""go away and quit working"" on a case-by-case basis is going to end up with every app either having a nonstandard interface for doing so, or no way to do so at all (like most update managers.)<p>Personally, I think ""some apps don't quit properly"" is a description of a problem with the apps, not with the ""quit"" command. Comparing to mobile is a red herring, because you can in fact quit background services on most mobile platforms, and it's a necessary thing to do. It's only programs that by design, always gracefully suspend, full stop, and resume later that make sense to not have a quit command.",1301154245

  with constraint propagation to prune the search for the next
  best move (forms of forward checking.) There are space/time
  tradeoffs between depth/breadth first search and the constraints
  used; sudoku(1) has options to control the combinations.
  The common characteristic for all constraints, here and elsewhere,
  is that they avoid trial and error. Its fine for a computer
  to guess and backtrack but a definite breach of puzzle manners
  to require a human to do so.
</code></pre>
I could be wrong but, yes, it does use backtracking to find the <i>constraint</i> that can give a number for an empty cell but it never has to change a number it has put in a cell. That differs from the trial and error approach that moves forward by guessing values and checking if it leads to a valid solution.",1301152705

To me these have the potential to be the big differentiator. It will be interesting to see if we end up with fragmentation (think DS vs. PSP vs. iOS) or ports of most major releases as long as each platform has decent market share (Xbox 360 vs. PS3).<p>It seems that hardware-wise and market share-wise, we're trending towards seeing major releases on at least iOS and Android. What's interesting to me here is that (1) so far it seems like indie developers are playing a larger role on the mobile gaming scene, and they won't necessarily have the resources to do a launch on both platforms until their games become hits, and (2) for whatever reason it seems like the Android gaming market (and app market in general) is very anemic compared to iOS, despite having a large install base. (This is just my subjective opinion based on using an Android phone for the last few months.)<p>As a side note, I do agree that in general desktop OS choice is less important than it used to be, but I think that it's due more to the democratization of data than it is to the rise of web apps.

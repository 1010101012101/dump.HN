HN has (had) almost something of a ""family"" or at least ""tightly knit community"" vibe to it.  Traditionally feedback here was expected to be honest and not sugared down, but polite in tone and constructive.<p>No one is saying that feedback here should consist of nothing but ""Wow, that's GREAT.  You're definitely going to be the next Zuckerberg."" And no one expects all of us to get together around the campfire, hold hands, and sing Kumbaya.  But there's no reason people can't be encouraging and supportive while also being totally honest.<p>Example:<p>""Congrats on the launch!  Here's hoping your project succeeds wildly.  I took a look, and while I like the Froozit and Gizamble features, I do kinda think the Frizgombit could use some improvement. I also have some concerns about how you will make money from this?  Is the market for a Zvezkikit for octogenarians really big enough to support this?  Anyway, best of luck!""<p>I mean, is it that hard to show a little support, throw some encouragement to the app launcher, while also giving useful feedback?  This isn't ""The Shark Tank"" or an interview with pg (unless pg is the one giving the feedback, in which case it kinda is) where you go in mostly expecting to be challenged and not really encouraged.<p>All of that said, I don't think HN has <i>totally</i> descended into ""nothing but negativity.""

The other benefit (unlike simple stock/bond investing) is that the portfolio seems to be pretty immune to variance from start date (ie, while investing in the S&P has consistently yielded around 7-8% real returns, their is pretty high variance in this number depending on when you start the calculation).

If I may rephrase your assertion: are rich programmers better programmers because they have more resources to attend job interviews and can program more often? Whatever your craft may be, time (or money; same thing), doesn't necessarily mean anything about level of skill. Can it be a contributing factor? Perhaps, but there are plenty of examples on both sides of the coin to say one way or the other.<p><i>Take two actors competing for the same part in an audition for an independent role. They are nearly equal down to a flip of a coin, but one just happens to catch the director's eye a hair more that day.</i><p>It sounds, to me, like you're confusing luck for someone making a decision. Your assumption, that a director makes decisions on how the actor's hair looks that day, is extremely flawed. The truth is: there aren't 300 actors each coming in and doing everything the exact same, looking the exact same, and performing the exact same. Hell, there aren't even 2. Each one is an entire collection of skills, experience, head shots, and each one will deliver a different performance.<p>Professional and successful directors are, for the most part, incredibly skilled; <i>masters</i> of observation with uncanny abilities to find the right person for their vision.<p>Again, allow me to make the programmer analogy: if two programmers came in and wrote the exact same code, in the exact same amount of time, and produced the same output, on the same problem, where does that leave the decision? In the hands of the <i>many</i> other possibilities that the person hiring will take into consideration. Luck? No, it's someone making a decision.<p>Could that decision be based on whether their hair looked good in a certain light? Perhaps, but that would be absolutely silly for the person doing the hiring; they would gain nothing from it. They certainly wouldn't be a director working on a successful blockbuster movie if they really were making their decisions as haphazardly and with such flightiness as you assert they are.

Now I know this wasn't the intention, but that was mostly the reality of that time (early 90's, late 80's).<p>2) Although Linux is the name of a kernel, it also became a banner for a different style of free software (free vs. open source, the two have different philosophies).  The Linux style seems to be OK with free and non-free software co-existing.  So calling a distribution GNU/Linux sounds like the entire distribution is in line with the FSF goals.  I'd rather leave the GNU title only to distributions that are 100% Free (GNU style free).<p>3) Back to point 1, a lot of people were brought together due to the different style (Cathedral vs. Bazaar) of Linux (the movement, not the kernel).

Here, let me explain you why paying a dollar for an app or a theme or any such crap on my (full disclosure: Android) phone pisses me off and why I'm happy to go pay CLP3250 for Starbucks coffee once or twice a week.<p>When I go to Starbucks to buy my coffee, I get a beverage that has a certain level of caffeine I like, lots of milk, is sweet and will last me the better part of the morning. I found out that they have a product that I like and it's a <i>repeatable</i> experience: I go, I ask for my favorite brew and it has the same qualities that enjoy, every time.<p>When I look for an app for my phone, I can see screenshots of it and see the reviews and ratings. Neither of these are very reliable, for reasons I assume I don't need to elaborate here. At this point, I have the two options: 1) I can go online and do further research to try to separate truth from crap; or 2) I can install the app.<p>When it turns out that the app is crap after all -- or that it's good, but doesn't do what I need, or that it's excellent but the stuff I happen to need doesn't work for <i>my</i> phone or OS version -- I have to uninstall it and look for a better one. Or give up.<p>At this point, I've ""paid"" with my time and effort and hopes, so this is where the difference between free and $1 dollar is a <i>lot</i> more important than $1 dollar and $4 or $10 dollars. If the application was free, I feel disappointed and disgruntled. If it wasn't, I also feel ripped off.<p>But the most important part is that this whole process is repeated for every app. <i>That</i> is where the comparison with Starbucks breaks down: shopping for apps is <i>fundamentally</i> different from buying coffee at Starbucks. The comparison with movies is a lot better, because every movie is different and every movie is a gamble. Then again, movies still have more alternatives than apps: I usually go to see a movie because 1) I'm so excited about it that it doesn't matter that I'm risking a disappointment or 2) I want to spend some time relaxing with my wife and it doesn't matter that much whether the movie was good or decent, as long as it isn't godawful.<p>Bottom line: when it comes to purchasing apps, the reliability needs to improve. Alternately, I wouldn't mind if every paid app had a time-limited, full-feature free version. Whatever the cure, the problem has nothing to do with the quality of the goddamn coffee beans.",1345217270

The Crown can take over any private prosecution, either to prosecute it themselves, or to drop the charges, and now handles most cases. But sometimes the Crown doesn't care to intervene either way, and the case can go forward on the private party's dime. I can't seem to find any statistics on how common convictions are in those cases, e.g. if it's mostly private parties wasting their time on no-hope prosecutions, or if there are actually a substantial number of people convicted in cases that the Crown doesn't consider worth prosecuting.",1345216520

I used to wake up and do the grim commute each morning to London from my home and the only thing that made it vaguely ok was Hacker News. It was a great place to go and find interesting articles from genuinely passionate people. It also used to be a really safe place to launch a startup that you'd spent days, weeks, years on - your project. It was a place where you could launch your startup and know you'd get great constructive feedback. People may not necessarily like your site but they'd admire you for having the balls to launch it, for spending time developing something that you hoped could benefit people in some way. They'd want you to succeed and they'd try and help you succeed with feedback that would ultimately help you. Unfortunately, today's Hacker News audience is no longer the same.\nToday's Hacker News is a place where users want to snipe at other users and find negative aspects to anything thing submitted. No longer does someone say 'This and this I like but this needs work'. Oh no, now the response is 'Hate this, hate that, this is pointless.'. Hacker News now is about correcting grammar and points scoring. It is pointing out anything negative at all that anyone has done, has said. It is no longer a safe place. It has fast become an acidic forum.<p>I've launched 2 projects (11kclub and Favilous) on here over the last year - both got a similar response. There was nothing constructive, it was just sniping - they saw someone had put themselves up there and they just shot them down. It's a real shame. I hope one day the site returns with the kind of audience it once had. Until that happens, I won't be going on my favourite site anymore - the commute just got a whole lot longer.<p>For now I wish you all the best...<p>Thanks<p>Steve",1345216464

The people who would do just about <i>anything</i> to get you to stop on your commute, talk to them, and hand over your credit card?<p>The aggressive tactics they employ are often illegal, and many instances of outright lies and fabrications have been documented.<p>But that hasn't really curbed the behavior - the charities and canvassing contractors (yes, they are predominantly for-profit canvassing agencies that only represent the charities, they are not the charities themselves) know full well that a great deal of abuse happens, but by keeping everything at arms-length they can shift blame and diffuse responsibility up the chain.<p>Whenever a canvasser is caught lying to get the donation, they are a ""rogue"" employee, cut loose, and the behavior continues. Whenever this happens at a large enough scale to attract media attention, the canvassing agency itself is ""rogue"" and cut loose by the charity. So on and so forth - nobody <i>actually</i> gets into trouble at any point, except maybe the canvasser on the street who has nobody to redirect the blame onto.<p>So yeah, even in the US, if you are savvy (and evil) enough, illegality ain't got shit on you.",1345216414

After reading your article, I clicked HN hoping for some good discussion, after all, I too have always found the coffee analogy to be a poor one, but the bulk of the comments here are people pissing over the quality of beans and who was superior taste buds.<p>For me, your first point sums up entirely my problem with the coffee argument -- and specifically why I spend $4 a day on coffee but rarely buy an app (though I wasn't like this initially). Even if I go to [insert coffee shop here (calm down HN)] and the coffee is a bit crappy, it still gets the job done. I won't be <i>as</i> happy that I spent the money on it, but at the end of the drink, I've got caffeine in my system.<p>The state of the software in app stores, and lets be honest here, is a bit shit. There was a popular post the other day by some guy about not being able to make a living being an app developer, and it was all ""boohoo""s.. until you look at what he's made. <i>absolute</i> crap. A concrete calculator that looks like an Intro to Android chapter one exercise? Boy, I wonder why he's not raking in the millions. Look at the top 100 right now. It the same 3 games over and over. My issue is that when I take a gamble on your app, and it turns out to be <i>completely awful</i> I don't get anything out of it at the end of the day, I'm simply out a dollar -- and no, that's not a large amount of money, but it is the principle. I feel robbed of that dollar because I got nothing in return for it.<p>I travel for work constantly, when I first got my Android phone, I would browse through the Google Market before a flight, and then dump up to $5 on whatever game seemed interesting. I had an initial expectation of quality-- I thought up to $5 was perfectly reasonable. After, I'm going to (hopefully) get a couple of hours of enjoyment out of this app. However, I only did this handful of time before realizing that reading the SkyMall magazine is more interesting alternative to most apps.<p>""Those of us in app development love to talk about how ridiculous it is that people will drop $4 every other day on a cup of coffee but will not waste 99 cents on our hot new app.""<p>For this to be an appropriate comparison, there would have to be a coffee shop that had the massive peaks and nulls like that of an app store. Imagine a coffee shop where getting a bad cup of coffee didn't simply mean, ""of less than ideal quality given the price,"" and instead meant getting a black, undrinkable, coffee-ground-laden sludge that can only be thrown away after the first sip. I think people would be a little less inclined to spend money on their coffee. Only under these circumstances would I view getting a cup as holding the same ""risk of waste"" as buying a random app from the App store.",1345216316

Neither merchants nor consumers should be penalized for electronic transactions in which credit is not involved. Perhaps this means that the infrastructure of bank cards, which was predominantly spread by credit card companies, would fall on vendors and banks, but my guess is that they would benefit enough from the increased liquidity that they would want to create such a system.<p>Levying a 5-7 percent tax on vendors is simply unfair, when profit margins, particularly on less expensive items are often less than that.",1345215703

The takeaway for me was that zero-determinant strategies do tend to win games, in that the end score of someone playing a ZD strategy is usually higher than that of someone playing a different strategy, but that both scores in such games tend to be low. Against a basic tit-for-tat player, the ZD player will win by a very small margin but the game will largely consist of mutual defections. Basic tit-for-tat, as the author points out, is never a 'winning' strategy--it always either ties or loses. Its strength isn't that it wins, but rather that it limits its losses. That characteristic of tit-for-tat is as effective against a ZD strategy as it is against any other strategy.",1345215671

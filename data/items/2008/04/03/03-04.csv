153610,comment,153441,153591,0,0,pg,,,"We've stopped quoting that now that we have competitors, because if that became a matter of competition, it would tempt people to do bad things.  (E.g. you could encourage single founders to apply, knowing you were unlikely to accept them,\ninstead of telling them frankly that they're less likely to be accepted without a cofounder.)",1207194214
153609,comment,152367,152551,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"I mostly meant the gaming part and the industry of SEO 'experts' who are involved with that. You are obviously right that search engine traffic is great. However, it is a waste of time focusing on doing ""everything you can"" to rank in the search engines, instead of for instance, working on making a good product in the first place. Search engines today usually use a QA feedback loop to figure out what ends up being the most relevant result for people. So if your site is good and the best, it will rise to the top anyways.",1207194001

We started filling it out about a week before the deadline, and I'm pretty sure we didn't submit it until right before the deadline.",1207193955

Honestly, I didn't know many people even read my site and I certainly didn't post the article expecting it to make it's way to Y-Combinator. It was a personal draft that I was going to touch up tomorrow but I have a 5am flight so I'm going to sleep for now. Suffice it so say I plan to learn Common Lisp and tried to stress in the first paragraph or so that these are personal inexperienced opinions. I'll try to give it a fair treatment later on when I'm able. Call this an early impression.",1207192022

I heard it was a classic book on investing.<p>Given what you've said, should I bother reading it if picking at random is going to work out better in the end? Have you read it and can make a recommendation as to its usefulness? In the first few chapters they identified the issue of massive amounts of information, but the book still charges on.<p>If you do think it's still worthwhile to continue reading it, do you have any suggestions for some introductory books that can help me understand some of the financial slang they use? :)",1288209594

They mostly present you the data that has been measured.<p>I am in a situation where I will want to provide e-commerce analytics as part of a more complete solution. But I would like to approach this from a different angle: provide <i>digested</i> data, with insight into patterns that could lead to increased profits for online stores.<p>What do you think could be extracted from e-commerce data that would be of value to online stores? I'm looking for information that is difficult to extract (e.g. requires a tech advantage), but can be extracted automatically or with minimum human curation.<p>An example of an interesting direction: e-commerce analytics companies offer ""customer segmentation"" views. But they are all just simple data views: you can segment based on location, time of visit, etc.  I think doing a factor analysis on customer buying patterns would be much more interesting and would provide real value to the store by automatically extracting ""customer types"" from data. One could then market directly to these customer groups.<p>So, to rephrase, I'm looking for ideas/pointers on what kinds of analyses would be difficult to create, but very useful for e-commerce.",1288209095

1840179,comment,1825063,1828770,0,0,fnl,,,"Well, I do not quite agree with your argument that Python is ""always memory-hungry"". As a matter of fact, writing ""good"" Python code is a very seldom observed art and most performance issues can be gotten rid of if you know enough about the language and follow the style and design advices of true ""Pythonistas"", as the ""gurus"" there call themselves (and many more who do not deserve that title ;)). However, I have been programming several years in Java on an earlier assignment, where stuff got so clumsy I wrote a 6 page manual for my team outlining ""don't do's"" in Java because it would either cost tons of performance or memory, mostly related to very basic stuff such as instantiation strategies and everything that might be ""good"" for OOD, but bad for performance. We ended up writing most of the core of the system in Lisp and then generated the ""light-weight"" Java stuff from a DSL one of our Lisp ""masters"" had conjured, to avoid all the bloat you have to go through to write simple things such as walkers, etc. in Java. If I ever had real memory problems ever, I must say it was with JVM, and it took me months to, for example, come up with a solution to index a few TBs with Lucene and the JVM ""crashing"" (well, hanging) because of gc (although that was back more than five years now, so things will have gotten better, I admit). Nay, I must say the Python/C combo is much to my liking. I want something that fits into that picture, not so much an alternative. And there I currently see Erlang as quite promising combo to my two favorite languages, after going through all the advice and pointers everybody here gave me.",1288208649

You can give the app a domain name, and it will perform cross-browser testing, spitting back a list (and screenshots) of pages with compatibility problems, along with the browser culprits.<p>Basically it works by crawling a domain and processing an image of each page for all selected browsers, including a ""golden browser."" The golden browser is whatever browser the developer uses to develop the site, and what we assume is visually accurate. Each browser image is compared to the golden screenshot using a difference filter, and any problems are notated. There are certain variances allowed to deal with font differences and rounded corners, but it really hits the nail on the head with float drops and other layout problems. It does this automatically and produces a list of all the culprit pages and problem browsers.<p>I've hated browser testing so much that it drove me to do this. I'm not sure how much time everyone else spends on this, but I'm sure it accounts for 25% of my total dev time.<p>Available solutions like Litmus and Adobe's browser testing are decent, but are far behind what developer's really need.

Because their clients can smell bullshit better than a purebred bloodhound. Too much bullshit means it's time to move on.<p>Beyond being the right thing to do, being accountable is essential to trust. When you fuck up, it will piss people off. That's just life – everyone makes mistakes. So you need to be the guy where people can say ""Okay, there was a fuck up, it was bad, but look at how hard these guys worked to fix it. Check out their plans to prevent it in the future.""<p>Luckily, the incentives are aligned here to make this mostly non-negotiable. When you get medical malpractice, a financial meltdown or an oil spill going on, the cover-your-ass impulses are much more compelling.<p>Even in those cases though, I insist we need to encourage a culture where accountability and transparency are rewarded.

(I wrote a summary about the process: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803155"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803155</a>)<p>A) - Usually in our projects or in my projects, I try go with the design first, starting with describing what we are doing, why, for who and how.(The Five W’s Of <a href=""http://52weeksofux.com/post/890288783/the-five-ws-of-ux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://52weeksofux.com/post/890288783/the-five-ws-of-ux</a>). The concept, being 5 lines or 5 pages, sets the background for the whole project.<p>From there I try to go with sketches, or wireframes to iterate the views or the interaction flows. Then start doing the ui in Photsohop. When I'm quite set with the UI I start implementing that and iterating the interface along the way. After that, or about in the same time we start coding the features.<p>B) - I'm not sure how much wisdom we have accumulated. About some things sure, but natural multitouch interfaces or multimillion user web services are still quite new. If we would have followed Jacob Nielsens advice on everything, we woudn't have sites we have today.<p>I think the best way is to keep updated what's out there and from there you can get inspired to find your own solutions. That's why I have iPads & iPhones, try to use most of the new services to understand how they work and how they're built.<p>I try to learn from other people and their process (like with simple todo app, Cultured Code produces a lot of sketches and mockups <a href=""http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/makingof/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/makingof/</a> and one of other Rails Rumble attendees described their process: <a href=""http://www.thevisualclick.com/notebook/2010/10/2010-rails-rumble-the-design-process-of-commendable-kids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thevisualclick.com/notebook/2010/10/2010-rails-ru...</a><p>C) - In our company we usually have 2-3 person teams, where one of them is a designer, which is something I would recommend. Personally I think the best is if the designer can also implement the design, because Photoshop mockup is not the actual design, the app or it's interface is. For best result, you need to be charge of the whole interaction.<p>D) - I'm not that sure which way around I got started, I had some classical arts education as a kid, and later started making websites and developed some web services. I'm quite bad programmer, altough in addition to html&css I can handle javascript, rails and php.<p>I think the first step is to know what's is great and what isn't so you know how well you're doing in your own projects. So develope your taste by surrounding yourself with great design. And like in any other learning, the key is just practice. If you have coded hundreds of features, then by the same time I might have done dozen of designs.<p>For me the hardest part still finding the right process for some cases. Sometimes I'm able to see the whole thing right way, and sometimes I'm just stuck or feel that something is wrong with the design without knowing what.",1288206467

I created ShelfLuv in about that timeframe as well and see both sides of the coin to use your terminology.<p>Part A: To me the design and UX is first and foremost. Especially w/ a hackathon - think of your product like a runway fashion show. On the front side it just needs to look and work perfect. Under the hood for me, out of the gate doesn't matter as much as long as it works and isn't slow to the point that it affects the user's perception of the product. I typically try to think of the user's interaction/perception/experience first. Mockups in Photoshop are pretty useful to me, but so are HTML mockups. It all depends on what I am trying to achieve. A visual experience - playing around w/ that would be best served to me by toying around in Photoshop. An interaction experience, mocking variations of that in jquery is best because I can click around. I can touch and feel my app. However I mostly start everything with sketches on pieces of paper or my notebook. I try to draw different variations. I look at how other webapps/apps do them. With ShelfLuv there werent many ideas or variations. I didn't start having variations until I had something working to show. If there's nothing to show yet, I feel that people have no baseline with which to compare. It's a lot easier for most people to say A is better than B, than to just show them B and ask them if this is any good.<p>Part B - I find that a layperson is immensely useful in this arena. One of my sounding boards is my wife. She's very intelligent but is not what you would call a techie or designer type. Alot of times I just want to use icons but many nontechie people will have no clue what these icons mean. Of course it's a compose icon - it's a pen and paper.<p>Part C - I would say you can outsource visual design, but it would be hard to outsource the interaction design and how the app works. Interaction is a process that can be very iterative. You try something, it doesn't work and you try it again.<p>Part D - I am an engineer by training but started focusing on user experience and interaction about midway in my career. I felt like I could have the most impact on users through a great product experience. I started by reading a lot of blogs and sites of great designers. I look at and try a lot of web apps and sites. I also buy a lot of iphone/ipad apps to see how they work and what they've done. Major obstacles for me is that I'm not a graphic artist and I can't design from scratch. I know designers who like to create textures and stuff from scratch and to me I feel more like a cobbler of design elements rather than an original creator of design. I will put this design element together with that element. I'm basically pretty handy at tweaking and modifying in Photoshop but ask me to create stuff in Photoshop and Illustrator from scratch using the pen/brushes/paths and I'm lost.",1288206125

Having gone back and pulled my files once I got the admissions job, my read on why I was admitted was because ""kid is being doing more with what's available to him in this odd part of Michigan than the other kids we see in his state, he also sounds pretty cool and fun and everyone likes the guy.  Plus he's in the top 1% of his class.""<p>So I was admitted to bring in some color and culture, despite being a white male.

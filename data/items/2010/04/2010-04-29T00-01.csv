A lot of people don't seem to like to look to other countries as examples of how individuals, societies, and governments can interact. Either as examples or as counter-examples.<p>NPR's excellent Planet Money podcast did a few shows on Denmark, which is like an economic bizarro-world. Employment law is such that it's really easy to fire people, but they have a very strong social safety net (2 years unemployment, or something like that) so the workforce is very fluid. Employers aren't as afraid to hire people (as they are in countries with strong labor laws like France) because they don't have the same fear of legal or interpersonal repercussions. Firing in Denmark is no big deal.<p>Taxes are progressive, crazy high, support fully subsidized health care, and the people there are the happiest in the world.<p>Note: I'm not trying to say every country should be just like Denmark, but just that the way we've always done things isn't the only way that can work.<p>On the other hand, you see people who complain about how ""government can't do anything right"" and ""all regulation is bad"" yet they don't realize the only reason that their houses survive earthquakes without killing them is that their houses comply with government designed and enforced building codes.  There's a reason the Haitian earthquake killed more people than stronger earthquakes in other places. Haiti has had ""limited government"" for decades.<p>It's easy to paint limited government as a moral ideal, and it's easy to find prominent examples of government failures. I personally hate bureaucracy as much as anyone else.

Engadget published the finder's photos of it on 4-17 - apparently he sent photos to several media outlets in hope that one would reward him for it. Although it would have been more appropriate to forward any such communication to the police, if Gizmodo had got it, taken some pics or video that did not go any farther that what was already published, and then sent or brought it over to Apple HQ - the same county Jason Chen lives in - they could legitimately argue the $5000 was for the story of how the guy got it, the legal doctrine of prior restraint gave them the right to publish, and they had carried out their duty to reunite Apple with their property.

How many people are searching for things like ""ad banner templates"" etc. Once you find those you can more directly provide a solution for what people want.<p>For example if there are lot of ""ad banner builder"" , ""free banner themes"", ""how to run ads"" etc, it more directly hints at what your customers needs are.<p>You could also try throwing a couple of your templates on <a href=""http://graphicriver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphicriver.net</a> and see if anyone is interested.<p>My main advice is to figure out what type of people want your service. On one hand it seems like you are targeting people that don't know or don't want to deal with banner ads but they feel like they should. I think thats problematic because the people that are prepared to get started with a banner ad campaign arguably know the basics of photoshop. Or if they don't they are going to need something a little more robust than what you currently offer.  Then there's the case where a person is 100% happy with a basic banner theme, I'd argue such a person would also need a little more help in actually gaining a return on his campaign. In other words the people interested in an easy, simple, quick and dirty banner design, are not necessarily going to be the people thinking scientifically enough to gain any long term benefits from banner advertising.<p>This is all just theory though.

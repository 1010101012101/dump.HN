Some highlights:<p>""Sure, theres a social networking aspect to it, but Google Plus is really Googles version of Google. Its the groundwork for a level of search quality difficult to fathom based on what we know today. Its also the Borg-like hive-queen that connects all the other Google products like YouTube, Google Maps, Images, Offers, Books, and more. And Google is starting to roll these products all up into a big ball of awesome user experience by way of Google Plus, and that snowball is starting to pick up speed and mass.""<p>(""awesome user experience"" is obviously highly subjective and debatable)<p>""What makes Google Plus different is that it is the new backbone of a company that does search better than anyone already--something Facebook could never compete with. You use Google to search, right? Well, imagine if Google knew every piece of data about you that Facebook knew. Imagine how better equipped they would be to serve you what you are looking for. Google Plus is a way of entrenching Googles dominance in that area, not a way of stealing Facebook users. If you are in first place, thats the time to accelerate your lead.""<p>and the conclusion:<p>""I know. You are still in the no freaking way am I joining another social network mode.

When we can't trust the players it gets unpleasant.<p>The ""radioactive for a long time"" thing is really hopelessly misunderstood. The unique thing about producing something which is dangerous for a long time is not that it stays dangerous, it's that it <i>ever stops</i> being dangerous.<p>You mine ""coal"" and you unearth ore that contains elements like arsenic, cadmium, lead, antimony, selenium and thallium. The same goes for most mining operations. You want your rare earth metals for your wind turbines and hybrid batteries, same deal. Geological deposits are rarely elementally pure. That is some awful stuff, and it <i>never</i> decays. It sticks around until the end of time. So if you're worried about the future, worry more about ""until the end of time"" than ""for thousands of years.""<p>But let's keep talking about nuclear. Where does 10,000 years come from? What you're referring to is the half life of Plutonium-239 at ~24,000 years. Pu-239 is <i>weapons grade</i>. The problem with it is very much not that we don't know what to do with it. The problem is we do know what to do with it. But you can't stop Iran from getting the bomb by not building new reactors in Virginia. Moreover, if you have no desire to blow up a city you can mix Pu-239 with Pu-240 which makes it useless for bombs but great for reactor fuel, and using it as reactor fuel destroys it in a lot fewer than 24,000 years. The other byproducts with multi-thousand year half lives are the same thing -- reactor fuel. Isotopes of Uranium and Thorium. They're actinides which are either fissile or can reasonably be converted to fissile isotopes.<p>If you like irrationally scary numbers, Thorium-232 has a half life of 14 BILLION years. The thing is, Th-232 isn't produced by reactors, it's the most common isotope found in the ground. It's fuel, not waste. And it's not even very radioactive -- the longer the half life of an isotope, the more stable it is and the less radioactive it is.<p>The most problematic components of ""nuclear waste"" are isotopes of Strontium and Cesium that have half lives of a few decades and are things you very much do not want to get into the soil or the water. But that is no different than any of the variety of poisonous and toxic chemicals we deal with on an industrial scale every day. And they have significant commercial value as radiation sources e.g. in nuclear medicine. You do have to be careful in handling and storing them, but how is that different than any other sensitive industrial use chemicals other than OMG NUKULAR?",1366991157

And they're relatively short-lived at altitude -- from seconds to days.<p>> Or even some kind of contraption that slowly releases gas from the balloon as it detects lower pressure in the atmosphere to help it maintain altitude and prevent the balloon from rupturing?<p>No, not ""releases gas"" -- that would lose the gas irreversibly. Instead, consider a scheme that used solar power to drive a pump to put some of the gas under pressure as needed, and releases it later as needed to maintain altitude. Sort of how a submarine maintains its buoyancy by filling tanks with either water or gas, depending on the need, and that does this by putting the gas under pressure to change buoyancy (and avoid losing the gas).<p>But balloons don't have very long lifetimes at the moment.

[1]. However they were there because they were put there by a rocket. I'm not sure if your question is implying that you could float your way up to LEO altitude. I suspect you couldn't with anything that could be engineered.<p>> Or even some kind of contraption that slowly releases gas from the balloon as it detects lower pressure in the atmosphere to help it maintain altitude and prevent the balloon from rupturing?<p>This is done already in two ways. One passively does what you describe - a zero pressure balloon - by having a hole in the bottom so helium leaks out as it rises. Eventually enough leaks out that the net lift is zero and it just floats.<p>The other is a super-pressure balloon [2] which does what you described in your first paragraph - it's strong enough to not explode until the pressure (and so density) of the helium inside increases relative to the outside atmosphere until the lift becomes zero. But we're still a long way from an altitude that could sustain orbit. These operate at relatively low altitudes like 45km/150kft. The drag and heating there would be enormous at orbital velocities!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Echo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Echo</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpressure_balloon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpressure_balloon</a>",1366991008

5613410,comment,5611702,5612111,2,0,dalke,,,"""Not publishing your code is anti-science"" ... ""open source is widespread and growing""<p>I've noticed that few people realize that ""publishing your code"" and ""open source"" are two overlapping issues, but they are not the same and the needs of one field are sometimes opposed to the other field.<p>Open source necessarily implies that the people who receive the software have the right to modify the software, redistribute it with or without changes, and be able to do so for a charge.<p>No one has been able to tell me why software for scientific publications requires the third of those abilities. Everyone is agreed that access to the code and the ability to modify it makes it much easier to review and understand what it does. I can also understand the need to share modifications with collaborators, in order to help carry out the analysis. But I don't see why published software can't have a prohibition on charging a fee for using modified versions of the software, or services rendered which use the software.<p>My first question for you, then, is: do you need the ability to commercialize someone else's software in order to provide good scientific review of their publication? More specifically, what sorts of review would that prohibition eliminate?<p>In the other direction, I have scientific software which I sell for about $30K. (This is not hypothetical - I really do have this). Customers get the source code under the BSD license. This falls into every standard definition of ""free software"" and ""open source"" software. There's even an essay (at <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</a> ) encouraging people to sell free software.<p>If I publish a paper which uses the software, then am I obligated to give my peers access to the source code for no fee? Or can I publish the paper, say it's available under a BSD license, and charge $30K for access to it?<p>So my second question is, are there limits on what I can charge people in order to get access to my open source software, which was used for a paper? If so, what are they, and what is the ethical basis for that judgment? (For example, should it be ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory""? Can it cover development costs? Distribution costs? Web site development costs?)",1366989936

We might know dozens or even hundreds of other planetary systems and see if they are like our own, or very different, or no other planets going around other stars at all. That will happen in your lifetime, and it will be the first time in the history of the world that anybody found out really if there are planets around other stars.<p>His stress on ""even hundreds"" shows that even he thought this figure was unlikely. Sagan was 47 at that time, so assuming the kids were about 12, he was hypothesizing into 35 years to the future, to 2015. He would have been pleasantly surprised at the progress so far, I think.<p>I wonder if any one of those kids have looked at this page and thought of that day.",1366989894

I'll likely open the email and give it 1-2 seconds of scanning time to make sure I'm not missing out and to find the unsubscribe link; if I can't find that, I'm hitting the spam button which (for a service like gmail) will in some small way affect deliverability for other users.<p>Nagging me about abandoned tasks is really irritating and it would teach me that using the service ""improperly"" is likely to lead to my inbox filling up with <i>no-shit-sherlock</i> emails, and would make me want to avoid using the service at all just to avoid this fate. If I abandoned a task, I did it deliberately and really don't want to be punished with email.<p>Begging me to come back because I haven't logged in in <i>x</i> days is likely to piss me off too. If I haven't used a service in <i>x</i> days it's because it wasn't useful to me and an email isn't going to magic it into the opposite. If anything, you might actually be offering me social proof from (my past self, not others) that the service isn't useful!<p>When I'm evaluating an app during the free trial I've likely made up my mind within the first 30 minutes, if that.

Is it worth the nearly $3000 I'll have to pull out of my own pocket? This year I decided it wasn't. YMMV, and for over 5000 people it obviously does.",1366988638

When I just did a big redesign of my company's website, I spent probably far too much time playing with the color palette to get it ""just so"". I'm not a pro designer btw, but I wanted to get this as right as possible as early as possible so I had a good, well, palette :) to work with.<p>Agreed that one of the discoveries I made is that HSB feel like the more ""technical"" way to design a color palette, and it felt more right from an engineering perspective. You define your colors as pure hues -- that's a top-level decision (""I want my colors for this project to be black, gray, yellow and white""). Those are your base H values. Saturation and Brightness are then your derivatives on the base colors -- lighter in some places, darker in others.<p>This is all self-taught, so my color theory could be way off here, but I also found that you can generate fairly pleasing schemes through regular intervals along the spectrum. Pick a hue, for example, and then look at variations in saturation in steps of 10, 20, 30, etc. It's not an exact harmonic scale (or is it?) but that was enough to give me a good base.<p>Check out the app ""Spectrum"" if you have a Mac -- I played with a bunch if similar apps and really loved this one the most -- still use it all the time for color exploring:<p><a href=""http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/43784/spectrum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/43784/spectrum</a>",1366988602

Clearly, making your site look better does nothing for the underlying usability, but the perception of usability is arguably just as important. I believe Apple has demonstrated this with each iteration of OS X: aesthetic concerns always seem to trump usability concerns (example include the Dock and the behavior of green window button) but the OS is more popular than ever.<p>Of course, you're still left with the question of whether choosing a flat design improves or detracts from the aesthetics of site. Here we're venturing into the realm of the subjective, but I'd venture to say that, given the current trends, it hardly seems like the worst thing you could do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/paper/nt.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/paper/nt.htm</a>",1366988550

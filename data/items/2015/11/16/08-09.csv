Isn&#x27;t the idea of firmware that it&#x27;s factory set and read-only?<p>There are multiple levels to this, and it varies with chipsets. Take for example, a very basic crappy chipset like the TI WL127x transceiver series. This chipset would be the lowest level. It is what implements the lowest level of radio signal processing above the hardware. That chipset has its own firmware. That&#x27;s very small. Typically, less than 128kbytes. But it is rarely factory set or read-only. Rather, it is a binary blob that is loaded on to that chipset by a linux kernel wifi driver. The driver is typically not a binary but source code that is part of the linux kernel. That blob, driver, kernel, and rest of the system are then part of a &quot;firmware image&quot; that is flashed on to your router/phone/embedded device. It is reasonably common to want to modify and customize that firmware image. Hence forums like xda, cyanogen, etc. The binary blob is the only part that isn&#x27;t very common to modify, but even then, given the high rate of implementation defects in that blob, one wishes source were available for that as well so that it could be better controlled.",1447662689

In fluid mechanics, the main objective for a given problem is finding a velocity field (once you have this, you&#x27;re done). Since the NS equations are non-linear partial differential equations, finding exact solutions is impossible in most cases. Some notable non-trivial exceptions exist [1]. Navier-Stokes is extremely successful in describing flows in many real physical situations. It is believed, but has not been experimentally confirmed, that Navier-Stokes successfully describes turbulent flow. Most physical theories have a fairly well known domain in which they are applicable and not applicable (Newtonian physics breaks down at velocities near the speed of light). Currently, we don&#x27;t even know if solutions to NS always exist, never mind make physical sense [2]. With this in mind, we have to acknowledge the uncertainty of the correctness of NS in describing <i>an arbitrary flow</i>. It is backed by well-grounded theory (parts of the equations can be derived from conservation laws) and works under many different conditions. This comment landed up longer than I expected, but my main point is that the question can we &quot;reliably simulate fluid behavior&quot; for an arbitrary fluid - is largely up in the air [3].<p>However, we should restrict our attention to flows that we very strongly believe are correctly described by NS. From the original paper:<p>>> The main problem of our method is the same as the weakness of all machine learning approaches; the learning methods are not capable to extrapolate the model far outside the data observed during training.<p>The training data are existing numerical simulations of specific fluid flows. The learning algorithm <i>learned fluid flow dynamics</i> from simulations. This is extremely impressive. It also achieves a significant speed up in simulation time - which is also very impressive. However, as the authors say, it does not generalise well. So, in short the answer to your first question is probably &quot;sometimes yes, but in general not really&quot;.<p>edit: I should add that the simulations in the paper are decidedly based on Navier-Stokes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_flow_from_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_flow_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existenc...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence</a>",1447662260

Also, it has somehow the most compact view with the most details at the same time, like all meta information (sharing, tagged people, GPS, exif, ...). For videos though, the Picasa webinterface is somewhat broken. Also tagging people didn&#x27;t quite work correctly.<p>The Google+ interface has the nicest way to tag people. And I think the photo editor is only available here?<p>The new Photos interface looks like the most modern one, but otherwise seems to have the least amount of features. Tagging people doesn&#x27;t really work here. The photo editor is much stripped down compared to Google+. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really show much meta information (no GPS? almost no exif, etc...).",1447661789

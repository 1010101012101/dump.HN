People tend to only respond to thoughts with which they either totally agree, or totally disagree.  People who sort of agree or sort of disagree just read on.  This concept gone nuclear (reddit) makes comment sections arenas for extremes even when most readers are not necessarily extreme.<p>Threaded discussion forums are more fit for pleasant campfire conversations than debate.  Debates need an arena more like a game show with two or more teams taking turns against e/o.<p>You can classify comments in three ways:<p>+ Agrees with point, goes further in depth.<p>- Disagrees with point, explains why.<p>0 Neutral.  Kind of a wildcard.  Could be used to clarify something unknown to both sides or to say something really funny.<p>Anyone can jump in on any side.  Comments can be modded on PG's ""How to Disagree"" scale, DH1-DH6.<p>Lots of debates come down to personal preference but at least you'd be able to easily break down the supporting arguments for ""foo"" being better than ""bar"" if you're looking to buy one or the other.<p>News.yc is a bit different.  There is a fair amount of, ""Ask YC"" and other posts that fit the campfire model better than the debate model.  Perhaps only deeply nested comment trees, usually signifying tit-tat style discussions, should fall into the debate model.<p>Thoughts?",1211180351

193896,comment,192938,193419,0,0,demallien,,,"Well, I don't have any kids, but I do have lots of friends that are raising their children whilst living in Paris.<p>The first thing to note is that there is generally a park somewhere nearby where the children can play.  Not always, but most of the time.  I imagine there aren't many families living in the areas without parks.<p>Secondly, for families with kids under the age of about 10 (when they can start to navigate streets on foot all by themselves), there's always the suburbs.  But once kids are old enough to get around by themselves, I would think that they appreciate living in the city as much as I do.<p>Thirdly, places like Clichy Sous Bois are pretty much the exact worst solution to providing living space.  It's like they've taken the worst bits of suburbia, and the worst bits of urban living, and mashed them together, taking great care that none of the good parts are included.",1211179206

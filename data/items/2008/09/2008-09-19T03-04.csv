If they effect a blanket short sell ban, you're going to see quite a number of business going bust. The ETF business will be derailed. So will the options business. Companies shut down.

Apple can point at Microsoft because they are the challenger.<p>For an established dominant player like Microsoft to directly reference Apple, then it can backfire - it's giving Apple credibility and legitimacy to Microsoft's own customers. e.g. ""If Microsoft want to respond to Apple, then Apple must be threatening them - maybe Apple is doing something right?"".<p>So whilst these ads seem ok, there might be more subtle implications.",1221796492

The lack of a Windows development environment doesn't seem to be costing them any serious developers for now, at least.<p>So that reason doesn't seem very speculative to me.<p>Personally, I think it's one of their core strengths that they stay focussed on what they do well (development under Mac OS X), and not try to spread out too thinly when they don't have to (clearly, they had to for iTunes; Safari's a longer shot). It might look like arrogance to you, but it might just be good sense given limited manpower.<p>And I don't think it's speculation to say that $2K invested in a blazing fast development machine like a 24"" iMac (you could also do it for less than $1K with a Mac Mini, which works just fine) is easily recouped, if you're serious about shipping an app. Even a decent $5 app that's not a flashlight should be able to sell more than 400 copies in a market of 10MM right now, moving quickly to 25MM and up.",1221794927

China's stock market has had an unprecedented rally over the last 2 years (up 600% from Jul 05 to Oct 07) and then an unprecedented collapse recently (down 66% since then).<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=000001.SS#symbol=000001.SS;range=5y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=000001.SS#symbol=000001.S...</a><p>In econ & finance textbooks, the theoretically predicted result of this is that it exacerbates market swings.  When the market is overvalued, there's no check on its upward movement caused by short-selling.  When it's undervalued, there's no check on its downward movement from short covering.  It's always hard to sort out causation from correlation - there could be dozens of other factors at work - but China's experience seems to support the theory.<p>As for your appeal to authority, it's possible for the SEC to know more than furiouslol and still do this, as long as they're incentivized to do so.

In the vote, which has a full change history, <i>nobody</i> spoke up for PeanutButter Wiki, nor were any of the sources mentioned in the comments here present in the original article.

Maybe that's fair, maybe not, but you can see why in a ""debate"" with no dissenters, this just got closed quickly.<p>The fix for this is trivial. Take the original content of the PBWiki Wikipedia article --- it's still around --- and paste it back into the article.

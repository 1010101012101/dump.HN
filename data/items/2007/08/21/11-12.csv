Its like saying being a viola player makes it harder to pick up the guitar (as you are tranposing strings/notes in your head). Yeah for about the first day it may be a bit strange but once you get past that it is not a problem.<p>Miranda was the first language I ever learnt. I am the only person who I know who learned a strict functional language from the get go. And yes, it scared and confused the heck out of me :( I am not sure if it helps, but at least I (only now) have a appreciation for the mathematical side of functions/functional programming (has taken me 10 years to get here though).",1187696578

Also, it just doesn't feel like what I want in a language.<p>The real double edged sword for PHP is that it made it very easy to do web programming.  The good side of that is that it let a lot of people write web stuff who otherwise might not have been able to.  The bad side of that is that a lot of those people write really <i>bad</i> code that is no fun to clean up.",1187695409

He notes that Java should now be thought of as a system language. JS in browsers was created in '95 to bridge the gap b/w HTML & Java.  Java was deemed too complicated for HTML users. The original idea was JS to be server side. But it never took off due to lack of effort by Netscape to create an Open source version and the tool problems.<p>""PHP is to 2005 what Java is to 1995""<p>A lot of the talk he talks about how <i>""PHP is to 2005 what Java is to 1995""</i> The talk was done in 2005. So for Andressen PHP or PHP like languages (Ruby, Python etc) are what he suggests. But right near the end of the talk he talks about Sajax and JPSpan where server side PHP (python,perl) transparently talks to higher level JS code in the browser.<p>You can find more about Sajax and JPSpan following:<p>- Sajax <a href=""http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modernmethod.com/sajax</a><p>- JPSpan <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpspan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpspan</a>\n",1187695378

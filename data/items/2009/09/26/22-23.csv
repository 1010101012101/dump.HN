It seems that the rights of the hundreds of account holders are more important, but you can protect their rights without suspending the schmuck's email address (and that is where I agree with Mr. Morris).  The court could have ordered him to turn over all of the data he inadvertently received and swear under oath that he did not retain any further copies and that he did not distribute the copies to anyone else.  Once that is done, if it turns out that the sensitive information was compromised in any way, the account holders can hold the bank accountable AND the schmuck.  If the schmuck is a decent guy -- and if an IT professional certifies that he purged all the data and that it was not otherwise disseminated to outsiders -- then the story should end there and there is no First Amendment violation.""<p>I think this balance test makes way more sense than what happened in this case.",1254005503

It's a whole lot different than the people running the wires and networks cutting of portions of the network from access to their users.

They would train you like a circus dog [...] but it wouldn't make you any good physicist.<p>Being one of such people, this is not entirely accurate.<p>For one thing, there is no practice of transferring students to best teachers, you have to want it get into the better schools. Another thing is that the best teachers are precisely the people who understand and will show you the essence of physics (or whatever your subject is).<p>Yes, a lot of time is devoted to competitions with repetitive problem set (the olympiads). But then, lots of time is devoted to non-competition topics. There are also competitions with open problems which require lots of imagination and original research on your part (e.g. ТЮФ, ТРИЗ and МАН for those who know). Some of the better schools require each student to complete a research project in his subject of choice.<p>My point here is that ""circus dog training"" is not at all correct.",1254005203

This is starting to congeal for me.<p>What the old system did was to provide a numeric indicator of other readers' emotive participation in the discussion. It wasn't a popularity contest (although it could be for some) and it wasn't an agree/disagree rank (although it could be for some)<p>These ""bad"" uses of the score caused the system to get out of whack as more and more people participated. The problem is, <i>there are ""good"" uses of the score</i>, which is to use it as a way to filter the site. After all, there are thousands of comments added per hour and it's crazy to think that I'm going to have time to read every single one. I need an indicator of those comments that seem to affect the most number of readers because that's where I want to add my limited amount of effort.<p>I am not on a treasure hunt for good comments. I am not here to please PG or the other readers. Some might be but I am not. I am not jumping onboard to upvote things already upvoted -- the sad fact is that I can't read everything, so some things will have to have higher priority than others. If you take away the numeric system, I'll find some other way to filter -- perhaps by comment author or by scanning the front page for buzzwords that interest me.<p>I, the user, have a need to skim. Now the system can either easily provide that for me, or I'll probably go somewhere else.

Right now with my own startup I don't have time to start something else up but if anyone is interested feel free to take this idea and run with it!<p>Idea: Social Web Dating<p>Problem:\nI've tried a lot of internet dating websites out there and one of the best is http://www.plentyoffish.com/ . It's free, I get the best responses from people here, and it works. The only problems I have with the site are sometimes the girls pictures are very mis-representative (the classic ""myspace pictures"") and its difficult to build common ground before a in person date, I don't know if we have any friends in common, interests, etc.<p>A really good company trying to change this is Thread.com one of the fbFund winners. They want to connect dating with your facebook profile so you an see your friend connections and introduce each other to potential dates, think match making.<p>My only problem with this site is its not explicit that the people on there are looking for a date and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable introducing someone looking for a date to my friends.<p>The Business idea:\nSo the idea is to create a site very similar to Plenty of Fish but to connect it to your facebook profile to populate all the information quickly and be able to see shared connections etc. But the catch is other users on the site won't be able to see your full profile until each person agrees. For example if I see a cute girl on the site I'll send her a message saying I would love to get to know her and ask if I can see her full facebook profile.<p>I already do this already, when I see someone on Plenty of Fish I want to get to know more I ask them to friend me on facebook. Then we can both see our shared connections and interests, chat on facebook, and if we both click we can go on a date.<p>The site would explicitly feature people looking for a date, unlike thread.com, and take advantage of all the social network features faecebook connect has to offer.<p>That’s the rough concept.

846177,comment,845938,846115,0,0,Confusion,,,"As psychological effects go, it is rather questionable whether it is possible to 'ignore names'. This question does not concern a fully conscious process. Once you've noticed a name (and it's hard not to), all kinds of things go <i>click</i> inside your head. You cannot undo the associations that were made; the mere fact that you attempt to 'ignore' names already indicates that there is something to ignore.<p>The unavoidable state of mind with which I will read a comment from 'cperciva' or 'tptacek' (whom I recognize, along with pg, edw512, jacquesm and a few others) is: 'this is likely to be a comment from a security point of view and I'm likely to consider it a high quality answer'. I don't understand in what way that would pose a problem, unless you suppose that causes one to immediately lose the capacity to critically evaluate the content of the comment and conclude 'hmmm, a disappointing comment'. I think that risk is larger when I would assume that I could ignore the name and would hence be influenced by subconscious processes whose existence I tried to deny.",1254003175

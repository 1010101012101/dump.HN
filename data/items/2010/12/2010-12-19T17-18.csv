2022101,comment,2021542,2022059,0,0,mrcharles,,,"Well, the average age of gamers is over 30 at this point in time.  I'm 31, and a game developer, but honestly, I'm finding games less and less satisfying as they continue to cater to the teenage boy in me, who is less and less as each year passes.  This year I have played almost nothing, to be honest.<p>I suspect there would be a large market for some truly mature games (and now I'm not talking about AO so much as games that have mature content, not tits and blood), but it's hard to say for certain because the big companies have decided that all the money is in the 13-16 year old range, and that's where games stay firmly entrenched.<p>It's true that there's a lot of money there, but I think a lot of it is simply that that is where all the games are being directed.  It's a feedback loop, where more money is put in to 13-16, and so more money is made there.<p>Once developers start leaving childish stories and content behind, and moving on to meaningful and emotional content, or more serious and complex content, we should see a shift towards selling significantly more at higher age brackets.<p>I was personally disappointed in Heavy Rain because it was the potential for a mature game sullied by horrible controls and interface.  Had they simply stuck to more traditional control schemes I have no doubt that the game would have done much better.  Of course, that wouldn't have made the writing any better, but at least it would have been a step in that direction.<p>Honestly, I'm looking forward to indie game development becoming more and more prevalent, where developers not beholden to marketing can influence bigger development by branching out and exploring new territory.<p>I guess maybe it's not the specific answer you were hoping for, and somewhat meandering, but I <i>do</i> believe it's simply a case of money-in-money-out.  If people looked for it, it would be there.",1292781262

Now, in part because it's one of the default front-page subreddits for an expanding user base on Reddit that mostly aren't programmers, the programming content gets buried beneath jokes, general technology or computer related articles that aren't about programming specifically, and the like.<p>If Hacker News loses its focus on programming and startups, it risks this happening as well.

2022095,comment,2020811,2020978,0,0,io,,,"I was kind of curious about this, too. If I wake up in the middle of the night to deal with a sick toddler, will WakeMate know I'm fully awake based on the fact that I'm walking around? I suppose it would be much like waking up to go to the bathroom, for those without young kids.<p>Obviously the alarm's only going to help if I set it for a window I know is before the kids wake up.  Otherwise it's their voices that'll wake me. On work days, that would suit my usual routine. On the weekend, I'm not sure it would be worth it to forego a potential extra hour of sleep by setting the WakeMate alarm.<p>But it's still tempting, just to chart my sleep during the week and be able to measure the effects of caffeine, exercise, etc. I'll probably wait until there are reviews and testimonials from people who have used it for a few months.<p>I was tempted a couple years ago by a much more expensive product whose name I can't recall.  I think it was $300-400.  In contrast, it's pretty easy to take a chance on $60. Cool product, guys. I hope you're wildly successful.",1292781016

Here's a few tips:<p>- Eat well and exercise 5 days a week. You'll probably think you're too busy for this, but IT HAS TO COME FIRST. It will help you focus and be more productive for school and the startup.<p>- Have a social life. Entertainment fuels creativity and productivity.<p>- Don't work ridiculous hours. That was probably my biggest mistake. I thought I was Superman and that I could work 9-2/3am, 7 days a week. That's about ~125 hours a week (including school of course).<p>It worked out for a while, but I then became extremely tired. People told me I looked like a zombie. I obviously had no social life and had stopped exercising.<p>The problem with this lifestyle is that it is counter-productive. It works at first, but then you become so exhausted that the more you work, the less productive you are. And the less productive you get, the more frustrated you become and you feel the need to put in even more hours.<p>Don't get into this vicious circle. It'll kill you. Trust me on this, been there, done that. I burnt out. Don't let it happen to you because it will take you YEARS to recover.<p>I think the smart way to do it is to plan your weeks properly. Schedule time off to go to the gym, see friends, etc. Schedule work hours and have at least scheduled 1 day off every two weeks. Stick to your schedule. Don't let yourself work ridiculous hours or slack off. Balance is key. It should pay off in the long run.",1292778624

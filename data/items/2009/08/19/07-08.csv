The problem with that approach is that you'll end up with less significance than you'll need for most applications (getting a 10 bit a/d to work reliably is pretty tricky, more bits is voodoo).<p>By the time you follow all this to its logical conclusion I think you'd end up with operational amplifiers.<p>Analogue computers exist, and even existed before digital ones in a certain fashion.<p>They are much more tricky to build and are not as universal as digital computers.",1250668507

772298,comment,766462,769289,0,0,brg,,,"I apologize for not responding sooner.  This is after all a discussion, and not a forum for simply venting.<p>As for logicians as philosophers, perhaps I am in the minority when I disassociate them soley based on their results.  Maybe that is perhaps defining the problem set based on the solution.  But in general logicians follow the rigor of mathematics, and as a result their accomplishments are timeless.  But when they are older often simply abandon the rigor for treatises on the ""meaning"" of the Incompleteness theorem or the futility of logic.<p>As a young man, Russell classified himself as a mathematician.  And to paraphrase hi, he became a philosopher when he slowed down, and then a politician when we slowed down even more.<p>Perhaps the split on mind/brain understanding is again the birth of the science of psychology.  Kuhn's work is obviously sociological in nature, yet it is untested.  In the regard, perhaps philosophy has a place as a proto-science.  It is were ideas gestate before rigor.<p>But you ask, ""So what?""  My answer is that these discussions and time spent are not much more than entertainment for those engaged; but they are portrayed as the most noble art and purest pursuit of man.  The general populace scoffs when an actor demands respect for ill-conceived political views or an artist is uncovered as a faux-intellectual.  In my opinion it is the same when the the twenty year old with tweed jacket and goatee settles down with Nietzsche in the university commons.  That's a past time activity; which is fine.  We all enjoy a football game, a movie, or a stimulating books.  But when we partake of them we know what we are doing.  We aren't lying ourselves and others that we are going to make the world a better place by watching the telly tonight.",1250667833

The problem is that the paper you get at the end of your higher education isn't worth that much anymore. Experience is still worth something, though. So an employer is better of to take the experience indicator, since the education indicator isn't that useful anymore.<p>The problem isn't that there are a few hundred-qualified applicants. The problem is that an employer has no tool to filter those applicants, so the applicants can't do anything to be more qualified than the others and the process becomes quite random. My thesis is that given a good graduation result the next best thing is to learn socials skills and tricks in the interview process. In the end HR makes a gut decision.",1250665988

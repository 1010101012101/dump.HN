2475513,story,,,9,15,rocamboleh,"What should I do about my lazy partner? ",,"My partner and I are in the very early stages of submitting a business proposal to an entrepreneurship contest (and hopefully more than one). We have both committed to carrying our idea out - to building our product. As such, we agreed to meet every morning at 8am (we live in the same complex and no travel time was required). Since we are still both in school, we wanted to meet at a time we both could commit to every day, the purpose of the meetings being to discuss readings we have done, to bounce ideas around, to add specifics to our business idea, and to generally stay focused and motivated. 
Here's the thing: in the past 7 days, my partner has failed to make ONE meeting. I'm up every day, down at the breakfast table by 8am ready to meet, and he fails to do so. Furthermore, he doesn't even acknowledge his absence. I'm upset obviously because this is something that I am really passionate and excited about, and he can't even wake up for 8am! I'm curious as to whether anyone else has had a similar experience. 
Objectively the answer here seems to be to drop him as a partner. I'm torn only because I respect his intelligence and know that if he was on top of his work ethic we could build something great together. It's truly frustrating to find someone you could see yourself working with long term - who has committed to a project - only to abandon you essentially. 
 I am worried about losing focus without a partner to push me (and vice versa) and bounce ideas around with. 
Help and advice would be much appreciated. I've got to turn this into a positive learning experience.",1303508386

Every single piece of literature I read (and it was a couple thousand pages worth over three courses) could be summed up in the paragraphs I quoted above. Or rather, the material I read was more or less a continuing rehash of the above interspersed with absolutely common sense statements like ""employees need to communicate"" or ""if some part of your supply chain breaks down, you can't make things"".<p>Much of it just read like shameless self-promotion, management ""experts"" with no particular experience managing anything more complicated a coffee pot wrote endlessly the same material over and over again about how something they knew was a unique and important observation that would revolutionize the business world if corporations would only just follow their advice...and then they'd never actually quite get to what that advice was.<p>It reminded me an awful lot of those late-night ""make money quick"" infomercials that never actually quite get around to telling you how to make money quick other than to go out and sell other people on the idea that you can tell them how to make money quick.<p>The academic papers were among the worst, least rigorous analyses of any phenomenon I'd ever encountered. I'm pretty convinced that if you can write a summary about a company, any company, for 2 or 3 pages, stick in some metric-less graphs that don't mean anything in particular but have labels like ""time value vs. motivation"" and fill your citations with non-sequitur references to Peter Drucker, you too can get published in management journals.<p><i>rant off</i>",1303507980

The idea is that you don't have to change batteries for daily commutes or short trips (you charge at night), only for longer trips.

I think Israel is trying out such a system in some way, its smallness makes it ideal.)<p>It's like a flat rate, some drive little, some drive more, but just because the battery is rented doesn't mean that driving behavior will change all that much. There is only so much you can drive and charge.<p>I also think that it would be somewhat involved to sell the battery on the black market. You have to at least get a replacement battery before your contract is up, so where's the advantage in selling your old battery on the black market? You might be able to profit a little, but you would also need scale, you need know how (how to manipulate the data those batteries would no doubt be collecting) and you need to be able to hide from the police.

The trouble is less the number of transactions than the linkage between each transaction and other transactions' liabilities in the system. In effect, serious DB's are in effect in-memory updates (some of our bigger customers run with no logical log write to disk on commit (really!)) running on 128-core Sun boxes (principal and failover). You can get through a lot of tps and the saving on dev cost and maintenance through this monolithic simplicity is great.",1303506070

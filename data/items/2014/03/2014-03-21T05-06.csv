As they indicated they can&#x27;t request official search of themselves.  And short of hiring a 3rd party company to approve/disapprove there isn&#x27;t much more they can do.  I think they are doing by trying to be transparent and not hide the fact what they did.  It could have all been hidden quite easily.  I see no other service not doing the same thing. Gmail with Google employees. Apple with imail and etc...  What I think is stupid is that the former employee who was clearly violation was using Microsoft services to bad mouth them with.  I feel like he should have been using alternative emails and services if he was going to continue his inappropriate actions.",1395381493

7440867,comment,7440305,7440755,6,0,dperfect,,,"I agree. I&#x27;ve seen some beautiful PHP over the years, but much of it... isn&#x27;t so beautiful. The culprit as you say isn&#x27;t so much the current state of the language, but the legacy left as the language has evolved and the community that emerges as a result of the language&#x27;s features/attractive qualities.<p>PHP is popular, readily available, and has a very low barrier to entry. It&#x27;s the first language I picked up, primarily because it was the &quot;gateway drug&quot; of programming (for me). I had little intention to learn programming, but began making some basic HTML web pages in the mid 90&#x27;s for fun. Other languages looked like greek and didn&#x27;t interest me at all, but when I first saw a few snippets of PHP, I felt empowered because it felt more like an &quot;HTML tag&quot; that could perform logic rather than being a &quot;full&quot; intimidating language; I was naive, but that&#x27;s how it felt. At the time, I didn&#x27;t even completely understand the fact that PHP was executed on the server-side, while JavaScript (in my web page) was executed client-side.<p>Ironically, from what I understand, PHP was originally intended to be little more than a template language. OOP and other features were added later to allow PHP to function more like a &quot;proper&quot; programming language. Unfortunately, it still carries some oddities from the early days (procedural <i>and</i> OOP ways to do many things, the default use of PHP opening/closing tags even in scripts where HTML/markup may not be applicable, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m happy that PHP got me interested in programming, and I think it still captures the interest of otherwise non-programmers today. It still empowers people to do amazing things without forcing all of the complexities (or best practices) of other languages. I don&#x27;t fault PHP for the situations described above (incompetent people getting in over their heads and turning a blind eye to best practices), but many of the features that make PHP accessible to these kinds of people (including myself years ago) don&#x27;t exactly help encourage or enforce best practices. The same could be said for NodeJS and others as you say.<p>The current incarnations of PHP, NodeJS, and others certainly allow for more disciplined and well-designed code, but the culture/community behind a language is shaped by much more than just the current state-of-the-art.",1395381022

7440860,comment,7435720,7436524,1,0,einhverfr,,,"There are times and places not to do this though.<p>I see business encapsulation as a legitimate goal.  the general public should not be exposed to the internals of your business.  They should know what you do and what you can do to help them but they don&#x27;t need to know all the administrative details.  Keep your interfaces with customers clean.  That requires not revealing the internals of your business to everyone in the world.<p>At Efficito, virtually all of our work on LedgerSMB gets contributed back to the community.  There is one exception which is not given back for this same reason:  We modified LedgerSMB to work ok in a multi-tenent environment.<p>To do this we did two things.  First we enhanced the authentication structure to make it work, and we contributed this work back.  However, secondly, we wrote a custom authentication provider to handle the details.<p>Now, had we wanted to release the custom auth provider back, we would have made some changes in structure.  As it is, however, the structure of the auth provider is closely bound to our approach to hosting.  Publishing it would effectively ensure that everyone would see our internals, and the benefit to them would be only in cloning our services.  The work wasn&#x27;t significant (maybe 5 hours development time) but it also wasn&#x27;t generally useful to everyone else.<p>So we kept it secret.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this any more than there is anything wrong with insisting that you don&#x27;t break encapsulation when doing object-oriented programming.",1395380876

A great many commercial disputes are settled in the offices of professional arbitrators by mutual agreement or contractual obligation, because it&#x27;s less expensive than going to court. Contracts give parties wide latitude to define what each others&#x27; rights and responsibilities are, notwithstanding the fact that they may be adhesive.Some kinds of contractual arrangements can be declared unconscionable, but not that many - generally only those drafted in such a manner as to be deceptive or which impose retroactive conditions on one of the parties (obviously it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that).",1395379959

It is imposed by force, you are given no chance to sign, a false choice (red or blue!) and only 1/385millionth of a say in it.<p>For the vast majority of people, contracts provided by the market are an even worse false choice: Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy imposes needs on every individual, fixing the supply of labor at a lower bound which is empirically observed to lie far above the demand for it, thereby commoditizing the unskilled worker and coupling his salary to the minimum dictated by his Maslow needs rather than to the value he creates. The difference goes to his employer, and a non-governmental tax is exacted upon each of his purchases that is distributed to local capital-holders according to their wealth, exacerbating the imbalance in an exponential feedback loop. There is no remedy when his employer resorts to wage theft (frequently), because the justice system requires time and capital that he does not have to achieve the simplest forms of redress. There <i>are</i> conditions for dissolution, but he fears them, because written between the lines are an economic certainty that will dash him repeatedly against the rocky shores of unemployment and homelessness.<p>This is a laughable notion of consent. When did he agree to have Maslow&#x27;s needs imposed upon him? When did he agree to abide by the rules of a game that systematically disadvantages him? When did he agree to initial conditions that give him far less than 1/400millionth of a share in economic power? This is the very opposite of what someone with a choice would have chosen.<p>The only things this hypothetical worker has going for him came from the government: minimum wage laws (and yes, I believe these are a good thing, since wages in commoditized labor markets tend towards the lower end rather than the higher end of the economically feasible range), worker safety standards, subsidized food and health care, education for his children, and so on.

It’s a “Five Parties Model” system. Entirely different...<p>All in all, it would be NOTHING like the Federal Reserve System we have already arrived at thanks to decades of collective trial and error, and acquired wisdom from the countless bank collapses and system crises that have come before us.<p>Except, of course it would be exactly like the Fed. And where it wasn’t yet exactly like the Fed, it would soon be, because exactly the same human processes, incentives and behaviours would govern its evolution and development.<p>Proving the point yet again that there is nothing new under the sun, and that bitcoin is more of a replication of the old unregulated past, under a new technological order, which society collectively refined and regulated until it created the system-stabilising framework we know today, than a golden era of finance no-one had yet been smart enough to discover beforehand.</i><p>ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/03/03/1787992/magic-the-undercapitalised-gathering-online/",1395378278

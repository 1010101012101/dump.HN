The other part of the time was spent on commuting to the gym (10 minutes) or getting ready, etc. This is an important point, as most of my weight loss did not come from the exercise: I burnt about 400 calories at a time and immediately replenished them after. The weight loss came from the calorie restricted diet (not overly so, I did create a deficit), which included lots of vegetables and fruit.<p>I have tried doing dieting alone but it never worked: I could lose weight, but then would gain it back within a year.

I started out not being able to do more than 50m without having to catch my breath and this was after an entire summer of running and a month of road biking, so it's not like I wasn't in decent shape. Swimming is a whole different ballgame. I'm now at the point where I can swim indefinitely (did 1500m with two 20 second breaks at the 10th and 20th laps recently) but it took a while to get there. Like anything, it's all about your form. I had to learn how to settle down and swim slower, gliding through the water, controlling my breathing, and reaching on every stroke. Once you get the form down you can pretty much go and go, but it's hard to trust that you won't start sucking water in when you get too tired. I find it helps to really exaggerate your rolling motion so that your mouth clears the water more easily when you go to take a breath. It also helps you reach your arm out a couple extra inches.<p>The most surprising aspect of swimming was how ripped my chest and arms felt afterwards.

Doing reference count updates is also generally slower in terms of CPU cycles than doing garbage collections. Oh, and ARC doesn't handle cycles.<p>That said, I think reference counting warrants more attention than it has gotten in memory management research.

You just made $X million from patents, so give me money to continue my work."" In fact, nearly the reverse is true; when the professor finds outside funding, the university takes a cut. So, if Professor X gets $100k from the NSF to study mole rats, the university will claim as much as $50k of that grant and put it into the university's general fund.<p>Now you might say, ""Hey _dps that's fine first-order thinking, but if a university gets enough patent royalties they can reduce their demanded overhead percentage."" In practice, overhead percentage at the best universities are set not by budgetary need but instead are set indirectly by the funding agencies themselves (e.g. the NSF has limits on overhead charges that institutions take very seriously in setting their internal schedules). The reason for this is that the academic employment market is <i>extremely</i> illiquid because transferring your entire research program from one school to another is a huge hassle; thus professors have comparatively little negotiating power in setting the university's overhead policies.<p>Having said all that, it's not clear that there's an obviously better system. I recognize the need to cross-subsidize university activities that aren't easy to fund externally. But it's important to remember that universities, in practice, make profits just like corporations. It's just that the profits go back into the endowment, capital expenditures like new buildings (though rarely capital expenditures like new research equipment), or at some institutions, administrator bloat. These profits are almost never directly pushed into new research, or used to reduce grant overhead rates.",1356574611

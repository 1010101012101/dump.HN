Many people see clojure as purly functional but clojure programmes are often designed in OO style as well.<p>OO here meaning polymorphism over types of your data &#x27;object&#x27;. The diffrence is that you usally never mutate your object.<p>It is fair to say however that the emphasis of clojure is functional and your code is expected to be functional style, only when you really need it, you start adding polymorpism but even then protocolls are expected to be a implementation detail quite often. Also, we access our objects the same way we do our hashmaps and even the same function often work on both objects or hashmaps.<p>Some people might of course dislike this approche where OO is not really not used in the traditional way and is kind of pushed down.

We started off with similar frustrations on planning trips. All the information you could ever want is online - and for free - so we should better off than where we were when you&#x27;d just buy a Lonely Planet book. But that&#x27;s not the case, I think it&#x27;s actually gotten harder - partly because there&#x27;s so much info, and so many options.<p>We&#x27;re a year+ into it, and have been iterating multiple times on an MVP. It&#x27;s a big problem to solve, so &#x27;minimal&#x27; is a bit high - plus it&#x27;s a different minimal for every traveler you meet (e.g. comment here on &quot;an option for children&quot; which is absolutely critical for some).<p>Here are some things we&#x27;ve learned along the way:<p><i></i>* Top 3 things people need / want that haven&#x27;t been solved:<p>- Local expertise - esp when traveling abroad - what is the local yelp / gothamist / etc?\n- Help with logistics - mostly around how to get from A to B - Rome2Rio is a great help in that regard, still takes a lot of work for planning an entire trip though\n- A way to manage a plan in one place - instead of email /bookmarks / excel<p><i></i>* Some of the challenges we&#x27;ve encountered:<p>a- Making a product that&#x27;s easy to use - If you&#x27;re only solving one step (e.g., online booking), it&#x27;s easier to create a workflow that makes sense. I love examples like how hipmunk have simplified UX for booking flights. We are building towards a workflow that lets you keep your entire plan in one place - ideas, map, notes, reservations,... and finding a UX to make that easy is a lot of work.<p>b- Getting to a product that really adds value to planning- We want a tool that simplifies the process of planning. However, we clearly can&#x27;t start with a product that does everything you need for a trip. Even in the near future, our product will continue to be an incomplete solution. So paradoxically, by being an additive tool in the process, we&#x27;ve successfully worked against making it simpler :)\nWe have to make up for that by really adding a lot of value and saving time fr the user- and getting to that point is also a lot of work<p>c- Marketing is hard - others have mentioned the challenge of facing giants in the space-  I&#x27;d like to offer another piece- which is reaching trip planners at the right time. Only a small % of people we reach are in the process of planning a trip. Then if they are, we most likely don&#x27;t yet offer very rich content for where they&#x27;re going - because currently our higher-quality content is still nascent. So that makes finding the right users hard. Any help here is appreciated btw - if you know someone who could use this send them along :)<p><i></i>* Why we&#x27;re continuing\n- Times like this, when we see someone get passionate about how much they wish this existed or how they can&#x27;t believe it hasn&#x27;t been done before. We feel the same :)<p>- While it&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, and there&#x27;s a lot of challenges we already know of and more we don&#x27;t yet - it is a really interesting problem to think about and try to crack.<p>- More than all, we love to travel to new places and explore the world. If we can share that experience and make it easier for a few others, we&#x27;d be ever so pleased.",1412689604

Get a powder of GaN, then vapor deposit it into layers.<p>Not quite. If you want something to search for, search for &quot;metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy&quot; (MOVPE) or &quot;metalorganic vapour deposition&quot; (MOCVD).<p>> How do you compare a single lattice constant like ZnO: 4.580 Å with a pair like GaN&#x27;s 3.186 Å, 5.186 Å?<p>This is a harder question than it might seem!<p>You can easily calculate a lattice misfit as a percentage <i>if the crystals are the same shape</i>: (a_substrate - a_film)/a_film. If it&#x27;s low, the films will be strained, if it&#x27;s higher then the films will have to relax through some deformation process resulting in disruption and defects at the interface. It&#x27;s a complex process, and there&#x27;s no easy rule for what will happen (keyword to search for is &quot;Matthews Blakeslee&quot; who came up with a model to predict how thick a film could be for a given lattice misfit before you get these defects, but in practice it&#x27;s quite limited).<p>Care must be taken to directly compare lattice parameters though. To pick a simple example, imagine you have one crystal with a lattice parameter exactly twice that of another. On paper, that&#x27;d be a lot of misfit, but because they tile perfectly in practice it might work really well. Likewise, you can imagine lining up two square crystals, you could imagine being able to line up the diagonal of one crystal with the sides of the other crystal if one lattice parameter if the ratio of their lattice parameters is 1:sqrt(2). So it&#x27;s not as simple as just looking to see how similar two numbers are, you have to consider the geometry of the crystals too.<p>This is where it gets a little complicated. For your specific example of ZnO and GaN, the ZnO value you have is for cubic ZnO so its three lattice parameters are the same (<i>a</i>=<i>b</i>=<i>c</i> like the sides of a cube) which is why only one is quoted (<i>a</i> = 4.580 Å) whereas GaN is hexagonal (<i>a</i>=<i>b</i>!=<i>c</i>) which is why two are quoted (<i>a</i> = 3.186 Å, <i>c</i> = 5.186 Å).<p>[Aside: GaN is often grown on its <i>c</i>-plane, in which case we can neglect the <i>c</i> parameter for working out the lattice misfit. This is something that&#x27;s difficult for me to explain in words, but if you&#x27;re interested in understanding it a bit better, search for &quot;Bravais lattices&quot; so you more easily visualise what these lattice parameters refer to. This means we only need to consider the <i>a</i> values when working out the misfit.]<p>So you&#x27;d want to compare the 4.580 Å value to the 3.186 Å value and ignore the 5.18 6Å value. But because the GaN crystal is not just a different size but also different shape to the ZnO crystal (hexagonal vs. cubic), it&#x27;s actually more complicated. <i>However</i>, luckily for you, ZnO also exists in a hexagonal form just like GaN and in that case has lattice parameters <i>a</i> ~= 3.25 Å and <i>c</i> ~= 5.21 Å, so the misfit between ZnO and GaN in this case would be about 2%?<p>If you&#x27;re curious, it seems like people do grow ZnO on GaN and vice versa, so you picked a good example to ask about :)<p>[Edited a few times for clarity.]",1412688861

Also, I was mostly lost reading Wikipedia.  What I&#x27;ve found: there&#x27;s quite a long list of band-gap semiconductors [1], and the blues fit in chronologically by coming after the reds/greens (Gallium-Arsenide GaAs stuff).  The blues center around Gallium-Nitride (GaN) [2] semiconductors.<p>> <i>They found out you could grow GaN by flowing hot gasses containing Ga and N on top of an artificial sapphire film, which would act as a template for the crystal to grow.</i><p>This must be what [3] refers to.  Mix molten gallium with nitrogen at 100 atm, 1000 ˚C.  Alternatively, mix gallium with ammonia.  Get a powder of GaN, then vapor deposit it into layers.<p>> <i>The problem is that GaN crystals and sapphire crystals are slightly different sizes (the gaps between their constituent atoms is different) so they don&#x27;t match up exactly</i><p>Right, several articles mention matching lattice constants.  Seems to be a big problem.  In fact, [2] mentions that the first substrates used for growing GaN were sapphire, zinc oxide, and silicon carbide.  A chart [4] shows lattice constants, which I don&#x27;t fully understand, but GaN&#x27;s 3.186 Å is pretty close to SiC&#x27;s 3.086 Å.

Like, yes, these are different sequences of characters that mean the same thing, but visually it&#x27;s very clear that they are the same thing; it&#x27;s not the perl &quot;there is more than one way to do it&quot; where the ways of doing it are conceptually very different.<p>Oh yes, this is one of the things that bother me the most about Scala, actually. I don&#x27;t mind if there are conceptually different ways of achieving the same goal, as you put it, because those different ways usually have different trade-offs; if you&#x27;re doing things one way instead of the other, you know why you&#x27;re doing it, there&#x27;s a certain benefit in doing it this way.<p>But syntactic diabetes is bad because it ultimately provides no real benefit. Different people will write different code based simply on their tastes and preferences and pretty soon you&#x27;ll have a mess in your project codebase, unless you enforce strict rules and conventions about writing code. Furthermore, people who work in a team that enforces one set of conventions may have trouble when joining another team that uses a different set of conventions. \nIn Java, for example, this is not the case. Yes, there are things that the language itself doesn&#x27;t enforce, and conventions are used, but these conventions are well known, and there&#x27;s probably no Java developer on Earth who wouldn&#x27;t adhere to them. When a totally new Java developer joins the team, she can usually read code right away, because there are no surprises with regards to the syntax. Sure, she&#x27;ll need to spend some time perhaps to really get what&#x27;s going on, because the code might be complex, but the syntax itself won&#x27;t stand in her way.",1412687973

For example, you can&#x27;t have both currying and closures if you insist on this.<p>Most of the &quot;syntactic diabetes&quot; examples in the talk are of this kind: They are actually separate, general concepts that happen to overlap. And some don&#x27;t even overlap, but the author does not seem to fully understand the language.<p>For example, that you can write both <i>f(x)</i> and <i>f{x}</i> is simply because <i>f{x}</i> is essentially the same as <i>f({x})</i> and the parser allows you to drop the parentheses if they directly surround braces. But `{x}` and `x` are not the same: the first is a scoped block, the latter is a variable. You cannot use a variable to express a scoped block and you cannot use a scoped block to express a variable.<p>There IS unnecessary conceptual overlap in Scala, but you can find that elsewhere: For example, there&#x27;s quite a bit of conceptual overlap between view bounds and type classes. But it&#x27;s difficult to blame the language for it: much of this conceptual overlap exists to make the Java interoperability story less painful (of course, you could argue that Scala shouldn&#x27;t try so hard to be interoperable with Java at the cost of language simplicity, but there are tradeoffs either way).",1412687798

So they definitely can influence the price, but they don&#x27;t exactly have the market cornered.<p>What they can do (and other companies with more of a trading mindset, like Glencore, do really well) is utilize the information they get in real-time from the entire length of their supply chain. This isn&#x27;t non-public information at all, and it&#x27;ll make its way to the market within hours or days. And it also pertains only to BP&#x27;s own order/production/delivery flow, which is tightly correlated to the market on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis but not on an hour-to-hour basis.",1412687218

8420853,comment,8420309,8420619,1,0,Osmium,,,"So, the next question, is why are these LEDs blue? And what if we want a different colour?<p>In the crystal, we have two types of particles flowing around. Electrons and holes. Holes aren&#x27;t &#x27;real&#x27; particles, but they still exist: much like bubbles in a bottle of water. It&#x27;s an awkward analogy, but we can imagine two bottles of water: one that&#x27;s completely full except for a few bubbles, and another that is higher in energy that&#x27;s almost empty apart from a few drops of water. These drops of water sloshing around are the electrons moving through the crystal. What happens when an electron (water droplet) and hole (bubble) meet? They annihilate each other, and in the process give off a little spark of energy in the form of a piece of light. For gallium nitride, the light&#x27;s blue because of the difference in energy between the electrons and the holes.<p>To get higher energy light (more blue->purple->ultra violet) we can replace some of the gallium with aluminium. To get lower energy light (green) we replace some of the gallium with indium. So far, so good.<p>One of many outstanding problems though is that LEDs have much poorer efficiencies when we want to emit green light. Lots of different combinations and permutations have been tried, but none are great, and we&#x27;re still looking for a better solution–this might be in the form of finding a brand new material, or of growing nitride-based crystals in more unusual forms, such as nanowires (imagine a forest of crystals standing on a sapphire &#x27;floor&#x27;) or quantum dots (tiny little pyramids). This can help because electrons act in very different ways when they&#x27;re confined in certain dimensions, e.g. if they can only move in along a straight line, and this can be exploited to make better devices. So lots of people are trying this, not just for green LEDs, but for all manner of different devices.<p>So this is what we do when we want to intentionally change the colour that&#x27;s emitted. But there&#x27;s lots that happens to unintentionally change the colour too, which is a problem if you&#x27;re trying to make thousands of light bulbs that should all look the same! This is the result of much more subtle problems that exist on the very smallest atomic length scales...",1412687142

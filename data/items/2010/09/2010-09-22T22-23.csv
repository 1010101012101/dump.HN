If you just SSL encrypt the logon you're given a cookie. If you send that cookie over HTTP, the end user is susceptible to more or less the same issues as before, only instead of the account being compromised, it's the session (until it expires).<p>The user can mitigate this by logging out, in which case compromise is limited to the session, assuming that the adversary doesn't have the ability to intercept and block the logout request (which they most likely would in an intercept situation).",1285196371

The typical rule is that a click inside the large rectangle, that is not also inside a smaller one, counts as a click on the large rectangle. Now, could we adapt the bubble cursor to this situation?

Saying ""You have been asked to reorganize this pack of cards into two decks"" is a bit misleading, as ""reorganize"" typically means moving things around without changing their properties. Sometimes you just assume rules that seem logical to imply.<p>To one person it might be obvious you can turn the cards upside down, to another it's obvious you can't. Then again... you could just get all cards into a deck, split in half and put each half on a side, so that no cards are facing up, or destroy the cards, or bring your own new deck and hide the cards you find, or take the cards out of the room to reorganize, or turn on the light, or bring a torchlight, or ...",1285193797

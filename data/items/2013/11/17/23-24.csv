I can&#x27;t really compare this to hg, as I haven&#x27;t worked with mercurial at all.<p>The company I work for has moved a lot of its&#x27; development to a github enterprise deployment, and it&#x27;s been interesting.  I like git extensions for windows, though it&#x27;s a bit rough around the edges.  It&#x27;s also a bit limited in terms of VS integration, but I can manage.

As long as none of your applications break when you update their shared dependencies, everything&#x27;s fine. The package management system generally takes care of this in modern distributions, and the package maintainers usually do enough coordination to avoid (much) breakage.<p>But if you&#x27;re trying to produce commercial shippable software (what used to be called shrinkwrap), you&#x27;re not going to fit in as easily with a package management system. Your binaries will probably need updating when the shared libraries update; that&#x27;s a major headache.

This is a very important property!<p>Code is read more often than it&#x27;s written, but it&#x27;s <i>skimmed</i> more often than it&#x27;s read. So making it easy to mentally jump around code without actually reading it is extremely valuable.<p>I&#x27;ve found this particularly valuable in Haskell because it lets you use arbitrary things in infix position. Now, this by itself is valuable for the same reason: it helps structure the code, neatly separating the operation from its arguments. Some things just make more sense infix. But visually, it&#x27;s often hard to grasp when something is infix. This is not <i>too</i> bad with operators:<p><pre><code>    foo bar baz + qux 11 quux\n</code></pre>\nbut it&#x27;s actually rather difficult with normal words infix:<p><pre><code>    map solve problems `using` rpar rseq\n</code></pre>\nNow compare this to the highlighted version: <a href=""http://jelv.is/img/hs-syntax-hl.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jelv.is/img/hs-syntax-hl.png</a><p>The most important part of the above snippet is how &quot;using&quot; divides into two clear parts. And yet, on something like HN, this is a bit hard to follow: &quot;using&quot; looks like another word in a string of words--this is exactly what I want to avoid with the infix syntax!<p>In Emacs, at least, infix symbols--both operators and names in backticks--get highlighted in a different color. This <i>immediately</i> make the structure of the above code completely clear. Then, when I&#x27;m glancing through it, I can focus on the part I care about. (This example is particularly appropriate because the two halves do completely different things--the left one defines the computation and the right one specifies how to parallelize it; chances are I only care about one of the two at a time.)<p>I think that highlighting operators also explains why I&#x27;ve never had any real difficulties with Haskell&#x27;s &quot;symbol heavy&quot; code.<p>This could be extended to a bunch of other structural distinctions I care about. For example, when reading Lisp code, I would love to have macros and functions highlighted differently. Macros generally represent some sort of code organization where functions are often part of the actual program logic; moreover, macros and functions behave very differently.",1384729899

However, this is obviously not a good habit, and hurts the comprehension of any other programmers that try to read my code. Or I could be addicted to using __add__ to call functions on my objects, with a hack that turns `my_object +&quot;user&quot;` into calling the user function on my_object. I could find this preferable to my_object.user() because it looks better, but that in no way entitles me to complain when a library calls + on a list-like object I passed it and it errors out, because I broke the contract of __add__.

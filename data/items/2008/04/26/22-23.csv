We don't have all the results from day one (we'd have to ask Twitter for the full archive), but we could easily display up to 1000 results without a significant performance hit.",1209250507

You go months work-school-sleep-work-school, waiting for the occasional free hour or two to work on something because you're passionate about it, sacrifice sleep or social life, and when you get done someone looks at it and says, ""I don't understand the work that went into this and I'm not going to expend the cognitive effort to gain any understanding, but, damn, it must be nice to have loads of time on my hands like you obviously do.""",1209250428
174527,comment,174359,174359,0,0,jrockway,,,"I look at it like this.  If you are the author of both parts, why bother making the application open source?  If you aren't going to make the whole thing open source, there isn't much to be gained by you or your users.  Nobody wants to contribute to an application that's half-open, especially when they're debugging something and they step into the closed library.<p>If the library is an OS library, then you should have no problems.",1209250401

174525,comment,174485,174497,0,0,cstejerean,,,"A previous employer recently migrated their infrastructure off of Rackspace. I'm not quite sure of the price but it was in the ridiculous range and we kept having odd issues with the infrastructure (the network was setup oddly so that we got something like 10Mbps between the application servers and the DB server). We kept having really odd problems and poor performance.<p>It seems they have plenty of satisfied customers but I would personally never do business with them.",1209250071

174523,comment,174359,174384,0,0,lutorm,,,"I think there's an exception that says that OS libraries don't count, since that would mean that you could not write open-source software on any commercial OS.<p>I had a difficult time figuring this out when I released a plugin for the closed-source software LCDC under the GPL. While it's clear that you can't link a GPL library into a non-GPL executable, the reverse case seems to be more muddy. I finally settled to my satisfaction that the <i>spirit</i> of the GPL should not prevent me from open-sourcing a library even if that library only is meaningful when used with a closed-source executable, given that I as the copyright holder can state the intent that the library be linked with proprietary software. It's sort of like the proprietary software is my ""OS"" and I'm linking to it.",1209249417

Basically they are people with a) lots of cash and b) a great need for complicated software and c) little time and patience to learn useful things like keyboard shortcuts, they way programmers,etc would.<p>Now I just wonder if we'll see drug dealers picking these up...",1209248833

They've been around for a while, survived the 2001 bubble, and they host 37signals and a ton of other websites.<p>I won't be a walking ad for them, but they reportedly have some kind of management structure that lets them handle support well. <i>shrug</i>",1209248637
174519,comment,174485,174497,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I'm guessing their (retarded) rationale for not showing prices is that then you'll be ""forced"" to contact their sales department to know more and then you'll ""have"" to rent a server so that you didn't ""waste"" their time...<p>Also, their configurations are ""managed""... My totally uninformed guess is that you basically can't do squat without contacting them so that's why you need Fanatical Support (tm), and if you want to do something ""non-standard"" it will be hard and costly because it won't fit well into their architecture.<p>I hope someone can come shed some light on how totally off the track everything I just said is.<p>PS: The guy on their main page is fucking scary!",1209248462

174514,comment,174095,174480,0,0,jrockway,,,"> I never said anything about games.<p>You use your Wii for spreadsheets?<p>> I wonder if people not working on open source games has anything to do with it costing money to eat.<p>No.  Not everything is done for money.  Do you watch TV?  Do you play games?  Do you post to Hacker News?  Probably... but you're not getting paid.  The point is you enjoy doing those things, so you don't need money.<p>Games are very tedious.  They involve lots of artwork and testing things 1000000 times on a tight deadline.  That's the perfect thing to pay people for, because the end result is profitable and people won't do those things for enjoyment.<p>You may think this means open source has failed, but it's just one specific instance of people not being interested in working on things for free.<p>Finally, most open source work is not done by volunteers for free, it's done by people being paid to solve some other problem.  About half my work is contributing to open source projects.  Initially writing stuff is good for our business, of course, but when we release it and other people add features, our apps are instantly more reliable, with no effort required by us.  We put in some work, the community puts in some work, and the end result is we get twice the library (or whatever) for half the ""cost"".  Of course we contribute to other peoples' projects too, it's just the right thing to do.<p>It's not a zero sum game.  Everyone can win when everyone helps each other out.  (I imagine the gaming industry isn't like this, though.  Helping your competitor is probably Evil That Must Not Be Spoken Of.  But other areas aren't like that.)<p>Anyway, are you done trolling yet?",1209247587

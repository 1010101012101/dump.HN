I googled &quot;timer 10 minutes&quot;, and got back a list of options, with no way to choose one that was actually good (the top result claimed it had an audio indicator but it didn&#x27;t work, so I ended up missing the end of the ten minutes). Likewise, I used to Google for weather forecasts -- then pick a site, wait for all its chrome to load, and then get my forecast. Now, I search for what I want and get it right away. If I don&#x27;t like Google&#x27;s version, I just scroll down to the search results.<p>At first, their only way to get users what they wanted was to get them off the site; the goal is still to get users what they want as soon as possible -- there&#x27;s just a better way to do so now.",1379926676

Anything that requires maintaining a set of values or decisions in your head for a while: bridge & hearts (count cards) or poker, go (weiqi / baduk).<p>-> It could mean &quot;more mindful&quot;, i.e., being more observant and aware of yourself and your surroundings. A lot of people today claim that meditation is good for this. I find that not owning a smartphone is helpful. Reading a hefty dead-tree book can be a good antidote for &quot;Goldfish Attention Span Syndrome&quot;.<p>-> It could mean &quot;better at reasoning&quot;, in which case some courses on philosophy would help (logic, epistemology).<p>-> It could mean &quot;more domain expertise&quot;, in which case you should spend some time taking courses or experimenting in some area of expertise.<p>-> It could mean &quot;broadening your experiences&quot;, in which case you should go out and start something completely new, preferably something which is a little bit intimidating.<p>-> It could mean &quot;being more healthy&quot;, because poor sleep habits, poor nutrition, and poverty all effectively lower IQ and general intelligence.

Whatever measure of inflation i try i can&#x27;t see 12x inflation from 1972 to 2011. It was more like 4x.<p>Launch rate - correct, problem was Air Force which first dictated the oversized payload capacity and even more oversized payload bay dimensions, and a huge cross-range capability (to enable single-orbit missions), resulting in a system too big and expensive for anything else, then pulling out resulting in vastly lower launch rates. So Shuttle was commercially doomed long before its first flight. U.S. would be better off flying it a few times to prove it works, then getting back to drawing board to design something fitting the market better. Reusable launch systems have been, and still are, realistic, it&#x27;s only epic fail of Shuttle which make it look too toxic to anyone to try (just like failure of GM EV1 delayed electric car revolution for a decade - nobody dared to try, engineering and business failure of a particular project was mistaken for the whole idea being bad).",1379926459

But i think lately, the value a bank is adding to society is somewhat deminishing, compared to the burden they weight. A bank makes its profit by &quot;taking on risk&quot; of loaning capital to someone who doesn&#x27;t have it, and extracting the surplus generated by the capital (ala, as interest on the loan).<p>This is ok, as long as the capital is used to generate &quot;real&quot; wealth - that is, production of goods and services. I feel that at times, a lot of loans are not used to generate product and services, but to &quot;gamble&quot; (ala, stock market?, buying and selling as a middle man ?). The process a bank goes thru to loan money creates extra currency, and this extra currency, imho, is what causes inflation. In fact, so much of economic activity is now tied to bank loans, that a failing bank means collapsing a corner of a table.<p>But i have no solution - as long as the illusion of stability is maintained, the system works. When it breaks, its chaos, but so far, all chaos has been prevented by either bailing out, or some other form of tax payer funded activity.

Ideally, your productivity and focus stays the same as they did before your side-project.<p>I truly do not think it makes sense to demand every person on a job is passionate about the job they are doing. There have been many times I have had to (even at a job I normally loved) do long, boring, and fruitless work. I did not do them out of my passion for the &quot;Mission to Save the World of Enterprise Banking&quot;, but because I am a professional who does what needs to be done and who does it to the best of my abilities.<p>When I said passion before, I was trying to express two things.<p>First, I was intending to express the attitudes that cause someone to stay abreast of their field, keeps their own saws sharp, (and ideally helps teach/inspire others to do the same), comes in and works hard, and pushes themselves and those around them to be better. Perhaps the best word for that is just professionalism.<p>The second concept is that I would rather be around someone who, while acting like a consummate professional, also enjoys at least some part of it. I love the fact that software development has more than I could probably ever learn, and it is a worthy challenge to seek to master its different forms. I have worked with several professionals who really do enjoy parts of the craft that I only barely tolerate, and I enjoy that about them immensely. They open to me a new worlds of appreciation for the craft. Just recently, I had to work on a few hundred legacy bugs for a few weeks in a row. They were unexpected, not caused by me, and deeply tedious. Some took hours to locate the cause. One of my coworkers really came alive doing that. He just loved the hunt and chase, like a detective working out a mystery. While I was mentally moaning and groaning after week two, he was just getting started. We talked about it for a few minutes one day, and I decided to try and see things his way. While it didn&#x27;t cause me to love bugs like a fine wine, I was able to bring my attitude around from a silent scream up to mildly interested. Maybe the best word for that is having a good attitude? Enjoys some parts more than others, and keeps quiet when they don&#x27;t enjoy it? I am not sure, but that whole concept I find to be important. The person who reads books about development and enjoys reading them is going to bring a wonderful attitude to the team, and can motivate others to pursue their own interests.",1379923387

PHP mostly marketed itself to ""script kiddies"", albeit not on purpose. It gained a huge following, and with it came lots of inexperienced kids that could ""do stuff"" easily. Mainly installing phpNukes, at the time, and modifying phpBBs etc. To say that Rails requires more programming skill than PHP is a moot point considering that developing web application, whatever the nature, could be done in both Ruby/Ror or PHP (with from scratch work or some framework) - thus it relates to the same problem set. Why would solving the same issues in one language/framework require a larger skill set then? It is as if you are saying RoR programmers are l33t, PHPs aren't - which doesn't make any sense, because I believe there are many great programmers and programs written with both.",1237582243

This means PHP will peak and Rails will surpass it eventually.""<p>If this comes to pass I will be completely and utterly stunned.  I don't expect to be stunned.<p>You do know that PHP usage has continued to increase, all throughout RoR's rise to prominence (and subsequent fade in prominence as Django, Erlang, Haskell, Scala, etc. shuffle in and out of the spotlight), right?<p>There are more PHP developers today than there were three years ago when Ruby started getting folks attention.  Book sales are up for PHP while they're down for Ruby, etc.  I'm not at all suggesting that RoR isn't awesome or that it isn't alive and well or anything of the sort.  I just know the reality of the market.  We have thousands of web developers using our software...and I can assure you that the vast majority are working in PHP, despite the fact that we went to great lengths to add a nice RoR environment a couple of years ago (we also added some Python niceties, but it aint exactly mainstream, either).  In fact, I'd probably even go so far as to say that more <i>new</i> PHP developers came into existence during the rise of RoR than new Ruby developers.  So, not only do I think Ruby on Rails won't surpass PHP eventually, I think it's been falling further behind PHP all along and will continue to do so, just like most languages in the web space.<p>I don't have to <i>like</i> PHP to recognize this.  Believe me, I don't like PHP.  But, I'm not going to bury my head in the sand and pretend like it is anything but a massive phenomenon.  It's simply the unstoppable juggernaut of ""worse is better"", when it comes to web software development.  Will PHP eventually die?  Sure.

The problem with A/B testing is that they tend to have a short horizon.  Facebook's famous newsfeed change pissed off/confused a bunch of people-- but in the long term it was a good thing for Facebook.  I wonder if they'd done a 1-2 day A/B test how it would've performed?<p>And, clearly-- on tiny things like shades of blue and pixel widths, just launch something.  With infinite resources it'd be great to test all permutations-- but surely they have more inspiring things to try/test that might move the needle.",1237580074

This makes sense of course from a capitalistic point of view.<p>Second remember that is the very same people who went there who are sending the donations - it's not the random public.<p>The people who went there are uniquely qualified to judge if it's worth the money - and they are the ones who decide to donate and allow others the experience.<p>It's is basically a finely tuned system that makes the fee exactly what it should be - they can not just raise it and be worth more.<p>Many people would consider those schools a waste of money - but they are not the ones who go there.

525503,comment,525110,525110,0,0,ardit33,,,"I think there is one clear field that Rails own:  attracting the most of douchebags to its community.<p>True story:
In a bar (John Collins)i n SF, few weeks ago, end up striking a conversation with somebody in a bathroom line.<p>Him: what do you do for work?<p>Me: I am an engineer. Software engineer.<p>Him: A Java guy!?!  (with a lot of smugginess).<p>.... right now i am wondering if i have java printed on my front of something. wtf.<p>Me: umm... no.  Java is only one of the languages I know. (I use it most in mobile dev).  I also work on python and lua on the server side, and come C too.  And you?  (i was still surprised by his condescending tone).<p>Him: I am rails dev! Ruby on Rails  (with even more smugginess, borderlining on arrogance).<p>....  few questions later, i realized this guy was a crock.  Didn't know much about closures/blocks, how many databases can you use on rails at a time... etc.<p>imagine working with people like that.  They setup rails, get a simple app going, and they feel they are in top of the world and better then you. If you know java, you are automatically assumed to be  be an idiot, and if you don't use rails you must be a boring person.<p>I think the Rails Community is full of people that suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect.  A lot of newbies, who migrated from php, or would have started with php few years ago, have migrated to Ror.<p>My point is that Rails is just another framework in top of an scripting language which I don't prefer that much.  While really nice for basic CRUD apps, as soon as you try to do anything advanced, it shows it's limitations right away.  I tried to use Rails, but I have never been attracted to Ruby as primary language.<p>Then I started using django, but I dropped it soon after my dislike with the way meshes forms and models, and the sheer size of the framework.<p>I think the lesson I got out of it, is that more than often you just don't need a full blown framework.  If you are doing anything highly specialized, a framework will get into your way.  If you are doing anything very simple, a full blown framework is just an overkill.<p>Frameworks like Rails or Django are a perfect fit for most medium complexity type of CRUD apps.  If you are doing anything else, better start looking somewhere else, and don't just buy the hype.",1237579930

BUT the Bay does have a lot of single people renting rooms. Moreover, the culture of shared housing means that here, in ""the metropolis"", we don't necessarily live only in our houses but in cafes, in public spaces, etc.<p>In many small areas that rate as having the lowest cost of living, the only rentals easily available are one bed room apartments by yourself. There is no culture of shared housing - see Nickled And Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich for how hard it can be to find housing in areas with supposedly low costs of living. Moreover, in areas without a shared housing culture, you will feel pretty lost without a big house.<p>That said, college towns often do have the same shared housing culture as the metropolis so this woman's choice of Madison might be quite good for her - but it is possibly good but somewhat unique choice rather than being ""anywhere but the bay area"".",1237579825

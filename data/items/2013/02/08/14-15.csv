I came across a web page\n    (http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247) investigating the source of the\n    following quotation:\n\n        ""Whenever faced with a problem, some people say `Lets use _____.'\n        Now, they have two problems.""\n\n    The author of the site seems to have gone through a lot of trouble to\n    hunt down the original author of the quote. The best he was able to do\n    was discover a Usenet sig from 1988 attributed to ""D. Tilbrook.""\n\n    I was wondering if this was you -- if so, I think you should contact the\n    author to set the record straight. His post was recently linked from the\n    news aggregator site Reddit, at\n    http://programming.reddit.com/info/xlov/comments and quite a few people\n    have been reading the story and discussing the quote.\n</code></pre>\nHe wrote back:<p><pre><code>    I can lay claim to being the author, but I cannot remember when or where\n    I first used it.\n\n    Zalman Stern worked for me at CMU so may have quoted me, hence the\n    attribution to him.\n\n    Actually one of the funnier incidents regarding my ""famous"" quotes was:\n\n        ""Software is the only business in which adding extra lanes to the\n        Golden Gate bridge would be called maintenance"" -- David Tilbrook -\n        circa 1981\n\n    I was at a meeting when the speaker used this quote and attributed it to\n    David Parnas -- I was appropriately indignant.\n\n    -- david\n\n    P.S.: Do we know each other?\n</code></pre>\nThe answer to his postscript was no. :)<p>And he later replied again to add:<p><pre><code>    By the way, I think I coined the phrase at a European conference in\n    Dublin circa 1985.\n\n    I was talking about the difficulty maintaining portable software when\n    supposedly ""standard"" tools (e.g., awk(1)) differed from system to\n    system.\n\n    Then later someone pointed out to me that it was appearing in various\n    signature lines which I suppose led to its being spread.\n</code></pre>\nI forwarded it all to Jeffrey Friedl (the author of the linked post), but I\nguess he figured the comments already did a good job covering the story, or\nmaybe he wanted to get explicit permission from David to repost the emails\nbut never got it. But I think David's reply is interesting and compuhistoric\nenough that I don't want it to die in my GMail archives -- and so I'm\nposting it again here.",1360334556

But when you do find some designs you like and are getting ready to contact people, here are some tips:<p>1) Personal taste - designers are unlike developers, whereas design skill usually can't be quantified. You can't give a designer a code test. My main qualification for a designer is if I like their work. Their style usually remains consistent throughout their projects, so there's no guessing involved. Request their portfolio and imagine how they would interpret  your app. Do you think it meshes with your personal style?<p>2) Personality - can you talk to this designer easily? How open are they to your opinions? Make sure you feel comfortable chatting, because I guarantee you're not going to like something in their first iteration. You're going to want them to change it, and the optimal outcome should be them welcoming the change. You also want someone who can criticize your opinions in a nice way.<p>3) Make your app sound like the bomb - the good designers have a chip on their shoulder. Many of them are able to choose who they work with, so you're going to want to make your project sound fun to work with. Its important, because why else would a top designer want to work with you?<p>4) Don't worry about distance - designers are easy to work with at a distance. Just make sure their fluent in your native tongue to get points across.<p>Good luck!",1360333139

I can accept that people will want to talk about this stuff without knowing anything about it at first - that makes sense, and without already knowing that it has already been studied how would they know? When people learn that there is actually a prior literature and well developed disciplines that deal with this stuff however, then deliberately turning their back on even the most basic part of the literature and the discipline when there are people who are literally explaining it in front of them is rank anti-intellectualism worthy only of contempt and scorn.<p>When looking at issues of gender in history, modern history does use the language of privilege - ie sexism might be talked about as manifest in terms of what records or history is recorded and treated as important by the people who are being studied. When discussing issues of gender, modern Philosophy has to deal with system level analysis - hence the use of ideas of systemic sexual discrimination as sexism.

It's possible to scan the public IPv4 address space reliably, but it requires a bit more effort than just sending out packets to see what you get back over a relatively short time frame.<p>You can split the address space up across several different scanners on different physical links. You can estimate the RTT to a network segment you're scanning and base your timings on that. Probing with TCP packets can yield better results than ICMP packets for this type of activity. There's so many variables involved.<p>Build a tool that allows you to send ICMP packets at a fixed rate (preferably in the kernel, or even without an OS at all if you're into that. Getting precise timings in user land is hard) or just a tool that sleeps between packets with the possibility of not sleeping at all. It's an educational experience. Scan a relatively small range of addresses bound to hosts on the other side of the world at different speeds and see the diff in results. Maybe there's a good tool for that already.<p>Whenever I read about ""We've scanned/product X can scan the internet in X hours"" I'm very sceptical.

The language ruby was the focus of the first four results, and after that some were ruby-specific and some were just Sieve with a mention of ruby somewhere.<p>Exactly the same applied for Go.  The first four were Go-specific, and the remainder were a mix of Go-specific and pages about the Sieve with ""go"" somewhere on the page.<p>Also, as others have said, one immediately comes across references to golang everywhere.",1360332068

That's it.<p>> In practice, prototype-based OO is inferior to class-based OO.<p>That is plain and simply not true. A shitty object model is inferior to a good object model, but that's got nothing to do with prototypes v classes (as far as I'm concerned, the world would probably be a lot more enjoyable if more language implemented a self-like object model).<p>> Its development environments and debuggers are quite lacking.<p>They're already ahead of most non-corporate languages and keep improving at a fast pace.",1360332007

The original copyright had a term of 14 years, a reasonable balance when granting a limited monopoly.  As they extended the term and strengthened the laws, there is no longer any balance and there is nothing limited about the monopoly.<p>Somewhere in all of this, their is an ideal copyright law with ideal terms and limits which maximizes the progress of science and useful arts.<p>I believe the success of the BSD license shows it is closer to the optimum than the GPL.",1360332003

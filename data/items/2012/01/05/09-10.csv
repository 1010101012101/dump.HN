A bit of not so distant nostalgia to consider: in some totalitarian states in 20th century (up to late 70's in one case I am aware of first hand), access to mimeograph machines were restricted.<p>In Ceausescu's Romania in the 1980s if you had a typewriter you had to declare it to the local police, so in order to avoid all the hassle of dealing with the police, or even the Securitate (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitate</a>), you'd just forget about it and carry on with living your daily life, freedom of expression be damned.<p>Also, Romanians were very frustrated by lack of TV air-time, by the end of the 1980s the Romanian national television was only airing 2 hours per day, mostly filled with bullshit propaganda. During the 1989 December revolt lots of  people actually complained about that out loud. It would be interesting to see what happens if SOPA (or any related law) actually has a similar effect on Americans' access to the web, will they complain on the streets?",1325757289

Another nice thing is the split into ?16? different databases that allow compaction to occur on a smaller level rather than having to compact the whole 60 gb file at once<p>The downside for me so far:<p>- I couldn't find any way to import my current couchbase single server data over to couchbase.<p>- The old couchdb webinterface (futon) made browsing through data easy, the couchbase interface seems to make this a bit more complicated. (Maybe I didn't look in the right places?)<p>- I couldn't figure out if I can still hook up the _changes feed to elasticsearch",1325755495
3428052,story,3427491,,1,0,digispaghetti,,,"Having used CouchDB, and seeing what's being done with CouchBase I'm actually glad to see this.<p>The problem at the moment is the fragmentation - CouchBase doesn't have all the features of CouchDB - but what it lacks, it makes up for in the memcached features which start to put it on a par with the likes of Redis for speed, with a much simpler API that other document store databases (you can't beat the language of the web for simplicity vs a binary driver)<p>Hopefully it will be a smooth transition and I will most likely hold off using CouchBase right away - but I foresee me using it in the next year for sure.",1325755490

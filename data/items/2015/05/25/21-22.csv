9601903,comment,9598974,9600695,0,0,rwg,,,"There was no need, really.  The university&#x27;s networking/telecommunications group ran their own pair of stratum-1 NTP servers, plus four stratum-2 NTP servers, so my stratum-1 wasn&#x27;t really needed.  I ran my stratum-1 NTP server simply because the hardware was available and I had an interest in it.  You see, the GPS clock (and its predecessors, a WWVB clock and a pair of GOES clocks) were relics of a time long past...<p>[insert wavy flashback transition here]<p>The lab I mentioned was a seismological observatory.  In the days before cheap, high-resolution A/D converters and computers with massive amounts of storage existed, almost everything was analog.  Gloriously, unashamedly analog.<p>Seismograph stations sent data from their seismometers back to the lab over a &quot;dry loop&quot; — a leased line with no dial tone or voltage on it — from AT&T.  To do this, the seismometer&#x27;s output signal was greatly amplified, then frequency modulated onto a relatively low frequency carrier (1–2 kHz).  The signal then traveled through AT&T&#x27;s network all the way to the lab, where the signal was demodulated.<p>Okay, great, we&#x27;re getting the signals back at the lab, but how do we store these waveforms?  The answer is a giant drum, a motor, some paper, and a pen or stylus — a drum recorder.<p><a href=""http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/input/west/proj/ASRA/2007/pictures/large/lbgoldschool.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/input/west/proj/ASRA/2007/picture...</a><p>&quot;Helicorder&quot; was Teledyne Geotech&#x27;s brand name for their line of drum recorders, but it was so popular that &quot;helicorder&quot; has become a generic name for &quot;drum recorder&quot; in the seismological community, much like &quot;Xerox&quot; became synonymous with &quot;photocopier.&quot;  (If you ever look at earthquake records on-line, check for &quot;heli&quot; in the URL.)<p>A piece of paper is wrapped around the drum.  A pen/stylus rests on the paper and deflects side-to-side depending on the polarity and magnitude of the input signal.  A big positive voltage makes the pen move really far to one side, and a small negative voltage makes the pen move not so far to the other side.  The pen is also attached to a threaded shaft that rotates, slowly moving the pen from one side of the paper to the other.  The drum itself also rotates, and the rotation speed of the drum and the shaft was usually selectable — most people had recorders with small drums set to record ~24 hours of data per piece of paper, with wider drums set to record for a proportionately longer amount of time.  (The higher the drum speed, the better the record quality, but then you had to change the paper more often.)<p>So we can record the signal onto paper, but we&#x27;re missing a very important thing — time.  We need to know <i>exactly when</i> stations saw ground motion in order to locate earthquakes and other seismic events.  Enter the GPS clock (and the WWVB clock and GOES clocks before it).  The GPS clock received a very accurate time signal and was configured to output a very simple timecode known as &quot;slow code.&quot;  Slow code works as such:<p>• At exactly the start of the 0&#x27;th second of every minute, generate a voltage pulse for some amount of time, usually 2 seconds.<p>• At exactly the start of the 0&#x27;th second of the 0&#x27;th minute of every hour, generate a voltage pulse for some longer amount of time, usually 4 seconds.<p>• At exactly the start of the 0&#x27;th second of the 0&#x27;th minute of the 0&#x27;th hour of every day, generate a voltage pulse for some even longer amount of time, usually 6 seconds.<p>This slow code would be added to the signal being recorded by the drum recorder, adding precisely timed &quot;bumps&quot; to the record.  When the paper was changed on the drum every 24 hours, someone would write or stamp several pieces of information on the paper: the seismograph station&#x27;s name, the date, and the time of the first time mark:<p><a href=""http://www.hilo.hawaii.edu/~nat_haz/earthquakes/media/SeisDES.tif.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hilo.hawaii.edu/~nat_haz/earthquakes/media/SeisDE...</a><p>Note the column of time marks between the stamped dates.  The narrow marks are minute marks, the slightly wider marks are hour marks, and the widest mark (five lines above the little earthquake) is the day mark.<p>[insert wavy flash-forward transition here]<p>Eventually, everything at the seismological observatory went digital, and the seismograph stations were upgraded with digitizers that had their own GPS clocks for timestamping data.  The WWVB clock and GPS clock sat unused until I cleaned them up and reconfigured them to serve up time for ntpd to consume.",1432591065

FirefoxOS can indeed boot on 128MB (so the problem with Android is not really the kernel nor bionic), but if the applications do run poorly, what good does that make (yes, it does make some good, my previous post was overly cynical). My (admittely brief) experience with a FirefoxOS device with 256MB was precisely that surfing the web was quite frustrating.<p>On the second and the third point I&#x27;ll both agree with you and continue disagreeing. Yes, in some places a FirefoxOS is the only option. And yes, negligible is was a dickish term. But I was <i>specifically</i> talking about points on a graph.

And while, as the article says, JITs are pretty much a necessity for languages with dynamic dispatch, which are nearly impossible to optimize ahead-of-time, they can be great for statically-typed languages, too:<p>1. Their ability to speculatively optimize (and then de-optimize when the assumption proves false and recompile) makes it possible for them to implement zero-cost abstractions, such as inlining polymorphic virtual calls.<p>2. They make it possible to optimize across shared libraries, even those that are loaded dynamically.<p>To those interested in the future of JITs, I very much recommend watching one of the talks about Graal[1], HotSpot&#x27;s (the OpenJDK JVM) next-gen JIT. Like HotSpot&#x27;s current optimizing JIT compiler, it does speculative, profile-guided optimization, but exposes an API that lets the language designer (or even the programmer) to control optimization and code generation.

At the moment that means missing a lot of things that people might want to be able to do (or need to be able to do to write things that act like freestanding apps instead of websites). The way Mozilla tried to get around that was to add a lot of Firefox OS specific APIs and then claim that those APIs were part of &#x27;the open web&#x27; because they were going to submit them for standardisation at some point in the future.<p>Mozilla seem to think that they are the sole arbiter of what the web standards are. The APIs they want to add are &#x27;open&#x27; and &#x27;standard&#x27; and anybody who is against adding those APIs is an entryist enemy of &#x27;the open web&#x27;. APIs proposed by other vendors that Mozilla dislikes are an attack on the open web.<p>That&#x27;s not how it works.<p>Things only become standards (formally or de facto) when all (or nearly all) of the big browser vendors support them.

There was little sign that the other browser vendors had any interest in adding a bunch of FirefoxOS specific APIs (just as how Mozilla have rejected various proposals from other vendors over the years).<p>You can argue that all this is very unfair. Why should Apple and Google and Microsoft have veto power over what APIs are available on FirefoxOS? But this is a trap of Mozilla&#x27;s own choosing. It&#x27;s the fundamental problem with the dream of a single platform standard for all user facing software. It creates a tight sandbox (both software architecturally and politically) that gives the big players veto power over everything. The idea of a single grand standard platform with perfect compatibility across all devices is certainly alluring, but it has huge downsides that nobody ever seems to really want to talk about. And that&#x27;s before you get to the technical issues to do with the web standards being pretty crappy for complex GUI development.",1432589679

The idea that Macs were &quot;happening&quot; was inconceivable to many. Forget finding mainstream software. Forget drivers for hw support. Forget file exchange. Forget networking with anyone doing real work at your company. It was all uphill and hard. That was <i>just</i> 2004.<p>Back then it was generally either hold outs from the dark, pre OS X days or early adopters switching over (or back) to a Mac. If you had your eye on the market, I think in hindsight it&#x27;s clear that there was a groundswell of interest in the platform (from passionate early adopter switchers, etc). But at the time, nothing was obvious and early adopter advocacy to just &quot;buy a mac&quot; fell on usually deaf ears.<p>We&#x27;re in a not dissimilar situation today with Linux. The early adopter segment is different and much more dev oriented, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. Add to this that there are some fundamental and very important technology shifts happening that I think are going to make a positive impact on the desktop linux experience over the next several years (wayland, systemd, container/virtualization improvements, packaging and distribution rethinks).<p>It&#x27;s happening because people like me are using Linux on the desktop every day for real work, and for many of us it&#x27;s eminently preferable to any other OS out there. It&#x27;s happening because we, the early adopters, are not &quot;on the fence&quot; about Linux: I no longer think &quot;Linux is nice but OS X just works&quot;. It&#x27;s happening because a shift to the web has made app lock in on a specific platform less of an issue. It&#x27;s happening because vendors like Dell are throwing actual resources at the market.

Once you get over the overabundance of &quot;tovarisch&quot; his works are truly epic, full of adventures and immensely enjoyable to the former teenage me. &quot;The destruction of Faena&quot; is easy to google. I don&#x27;t know about any other English translations.<p>For an easy way in read Bulychev&#x27;s &quot;Those Who Survive&quot;. Bulychev is famous for writing SF books for children but this story is more than that. Read it.<p>I read just a couple of short stories of Ivan Efremov and I cannot say much about him except for the fact that he has some highly regarded SF novels.<p>There are also Strugatsky brothers who I think are well known in the West.<p>Somehow I thought that Stanislaw Lem belongs to the list. His works felt closer to Soviet SF than to the western SF. He was a brilliant Polish writer.<p>Want a good laugh? Read Ilf and Petrof&#x27;s &quot;The Twelve chairs&quot;.<p>As you see I am mostly a SF guy. I don&#x27;t find the prose of the Soviet period interesting maybe because it mostly covers the consequences of the wars and revolutions that Russia had to go through. These events seemed to overshadow everything else in the mind of a Soviet writer. If you want to read about the heroism of the Soviet people during and after the WW2 and atrocities of the revolutions there are a lot of books to chose. My grandmother lived through the WW2 and read and reread the books about it many times.<p>As for the topic the West praises the works of art that depict only how tough it is to be Russian and live in Soviet Russia.

It&#x27;s not even on a requirement list when you want to market your device using Firefox OS brand. Phones like ZTE Open often came with blocked bootloader you had to &quot;jailbreak&quot; to upgrade FxOS by yourself - seems familiar, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Some time ago I tried to compile Firefox OS to GTA04 - a hardware upgrade for Openmoko Neo Freerunner. It&#x27;s pretty much the most open mobile phone out there these days, allowing you to run basically any GNU/Linux distro you&#x27;d want on it. I failed - available documentation is lacking; or actually, it focuses on something completely different. It assumes that you either have a Android phone and goes to great extent describing how to extract non-free binary blobs from your current system and apply them to FxOS, or you have a great knowledge of Android build system and you can handle everything by yourself. GTA04 isn&#x27;t Android based - while there is Replicant build working on it, it&#x27;s still closer to standard PC way than Android phones when it comes to stuff like booting etc. Not having much experience with Android from developer side, I simply got lost in all those clearly Android-based instructions.<p>You&#x27;d at least think that Gonk, the hardware abstraction layer of Firefox OS implemented on top of Android base system, would be just a compatibility measure for dealing with vendors that only provide Android support. It&#x27;s not the case - even though Honk (a Gonk reimplementation based on standard GNU/Unix way of how systems work) exists, it was contributed as a part of experimental Raspberry Pi port and is not really maintained ever since. It makes me sad, cause Firefox OS had the potential to actually move smartphones in general towards being a little more open platforms, which is always close to my heart as a long-time Openmoko and OpenPhoenux supporter and contributor, but sadly this aspect got basically ignored by Mozilla itself and they went with pragmatic &quot;let&#x27;s just make it work, even if it means having non-free low-level androidware under our free OS layer&quot; :(",1432588278

7046282,comment,7044690,7044955,1,0,mercer,,,"I almost never get lonely, and love being alone. A big part of this is just personality, I think, but there are two other factors that contribute. First of all, as you mention, I practiced being comfortably alone. I intentionally traveled alone, and sometimes chose to sit in a bar all by myself, just taking in the sights and (initially) feeling very self-conscious. But another important factor is that being alone is a choice for me. If I don&#x27;t want to be alone, I have plenty of close friends, acquaintances, and activities that would alleviate loneliness.<p>In fact, the latter might be a much bigger factor that I&#x27;ve realized. The only times I recall feeling lonely were when I felt a need to socialize or talk to a friend, but couldn&#x27;t, or being at a party with nobody to talk to.",1389542100

7046278,comment,7046099,7046099,6,0,tokenadult,,,"The Baby Boom was a birth cohort that spanned a lot of years, characterized only by high birth rates. (The Baby Boom is the only time in United States history when the long-term trend of ever higher ages of first marriage and ever lower rates of fertility was reversed.) A lot of thoughtful analysts distinguish the earlier part of the Baby Boom (parents who were part of the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; which participated as adults in World War II) from the later part of the Baby Boom (parents in the &quot;Silent Generation,&quot; whose earliest memories are of the Great Depression, and who didn&#x27;t reach adulthood until after the war was over). I think that makes sense. Greatest Generation parents were about looking out for other people, as a group central tendency, and Silent Generation parents were about looking out for number one. (Silent Generation persons politically did well, gaining the greatest net surplus over the actuarial value of their Social Security benefits through taxation of younger working people, for example.)<p>In each generation, there are parents of differing core values. There are also children who either accept their parents&#x27; values, or react against them. That goes on throughout history. The one sure thing that demographers discovered is that during the Baby Boom there was a lower ratio of care-giving adults to minor children in the whole society than at almost any time before or since. Large family sizes spread parenting thin. So the Baby Boomers had less parental face time to receive parental influence one way or another than the preceding generations, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to hear (as we do in the opinion essay submitted here) that Baby Boomers, as a group central tendency, are less practiced in traditional parenting approaches than earlier generations, for better or for worse.<p>(Can you guess where I fit among the generations by what I write here?)",1389542014

Can you explain what sort of agreement gives you such expectations?<p>Barring outrageously generous clauses in your contract, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are being &quot;screwed over&quot;: having valuable ideas is your job, and you simply have so little power that the other partners don&#x27;t think they need to transfer money from their pockets to your pockets to make you happy.<p>The standard response is quitting, leaving the other partners alone with their greed; if you are as valuable and irreplaceable as you say, the vaguest hint of jumping ship should be a good starting point to negotiate a far better compensation.<p>If you can&#x27;t quit, for example because you invested your own money in the company and therefore you really want it to be successful, you just have to be nice.

This is more akin to dumping extra cargo on an overloaded donkey because of its supposed utility.<p>When education rankings are already so poor, adding another layer to the compulsory curriculum complicates the mess even further.<p>What&#x27;s more is that all of the school districts that are rushing to implement this first (like Chicago) all struggle with low results and inefficient, highly bureaucratic teaching. Something tells me that adding coding (while erroneously calling it &quot;computer science&quot; to make it sound grandiose) will only lead to further mediocrity, deterioration and a lot of kids coming out with false and butchered ideas of what programming entails.<p>It&#x27;s not that teaching programming is bad, so much as trusting that the compulsory school system will get it right is laughable and a recipe for disaster. This has the potential to go very wrong, or even be ultimately useless if it&#x27;s just entry-level procedural constructs being repeated ad nauseam.<p>The camp here appears to be divided between people who highly support it at all costs and people who criticize all aspects.

Let&#x27;s see a few of these brilliant examples:<p>> it’s easy to see how the Boomers earned their reputation as the Me Generation. Me before We. Putting the protection of ideas and wealth before the sharing of them is now standard.<p>Fair enough. <i>How</i> does the author know this?<p>> A New Jersey-based accountant told me that he sees a clear difference between his older clients and his younger ones. “My older clients want to work within the confines of the tax code to do what is fair,” he explained. “They are willing to simply pay the tax they owe. The next generation spends lots of time looking to exploit every loophole and nuance in the tax code to reduce their responsibility to as little as possible.”<p>What a rock-solid argument!<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more!<p>> Generation Y is said to have a sense of entitlement.<p>Ok... let&#x27;s see some evidence of that?<p>> Many employers complain of the demands their entry-level employees often make.<p>Could it <i>possibly</i> be the same many employers who try to offer unpaid interships that last basically forever, or who are cutting up expenses by outsourcing work to India so that the board members can buy bigger boats? Obviously, not every employer who claims that the demands of <i>some</i> entry-level employees are too harsh, but without any evidence of whether or not those demands are justified, the number of employers claiming that is no argument, for either side.<p>The apex of arrogance is, in my opinion, this one:<p>> According to a study at Northwestern University, the number of children and young people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shot up 66 percent between 2000 and 2010. Why the sudden and huge spike in a frontal lobe dysfunction over the course of a decade?<p>An interesting point, why?<p>At this point, you would obviously expect the author to quote one or several serious medical studies which show certain degrees of correlation between the development of ADHD and various factors that have been prevalent during the 2000-2010 decade to a greater degree than before. But no!<p>> I would submit that this huge spike is not simply because more people have ADHD than previous generations, though this could be true. Nor is it due to an increase in the number of parents having their children tested, though this could also be true. Though there are, of course, many genuine cases of ADHD, the sudden spike may be the result of something as simple as misdiagnosis.<p>Ok, ok, I&#x27;m still reading. <i>Maybe</i> there&#x27;s a yet-unknown study, or at least one that is in development because someone who&#x27;s an expert on brain stuff has a hypothesis?<p>> We know that sometimes our wires can get crossed and the wrong behaviors can be incentivized. Someone who finds the dopamine- and serotonin-releasing effects of alcohol as a teenager can become conditioned to look to alcohol to suppress emotional pain instead of learning to look to people for support. This can show up later in life as alcoholism. In this same way, the dopamine-releasing effects of the bing, buzz or flash of a cell phone feel good and create the desire and drive to repeat the behavior that produces that feeling.<p>Nope. What the author is proposing is, in fact, a personal hypothesis, based on a fairly superficial understanding of a complicated process (&quot;our wires get crossed&quot;).<p>This wouldn&#x27;t even be a problem, <i>if</i> the author would at least bother to provide some test -- the hell with that, at least <i>some</i> way to test this hypothesis. Who knows, maybe he got it right, in spite of an incorrect reasoning process (there was a time when reasoning by analogy was the dominant form of hypothesizing, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly a period renowned for its intellectual achievements). But no.<p>I don&#x27;t want to label the article as a load of useless rubbish. It&#x27;s not wrong per se, I think it&#x27;s just incorrectly titled, because it doesn&#x27;t try to give a meaningful answer to the question in its title, just to present some of the author&#x27;s prejudices.

I guess they show this to their friends, family, etc.. They feel like they are contributing maybe(?!) They seek for attention (?!) Or maybe it is just for trolling...<p>When you use Google Play on your PC, you can click on the names of the commentators. Maybe they think that it is a some kind of communication way :S Something like &quot;add/PM me if you like&quot;. Weird.<p>When I check local reddit-like website of Turkey (eksisözlük), there are many people who are annoyed by this new meme.

Does it make sense? One-line-long comments with 1 star are being seen on front page of the apps... What about 2/3/4/5 starred useful comments? Why does Google Play show only 1-starred ones?

7046245,comment,7044690,7044690,13,0,mercer,,,"Loneliness has been one of the issues consistently on my mind for at least the past few years. From my early twenties on I&#x27;ve always lived in big cities. During my studies I was part of a student organization (very much like a fraternity), and after that I moved around between cities and as a result I made many friends, particularly &#x27;expats&#x27;.<p>As I got closer to them, no matter what personality or lifestyle they had, loneliness was a common feeling. This often led to intense unhappiness and even outright depression, and some of these friends eventually returned to their home cities or college cities because they missed their friends.<p>Over time I started thinking more and more about this issue, as it clearly seems to be a problem, and a big one at that. I thought about the causes, but most importantly I tried to think of solutions.<p>When it comes to causes, one tentative conclusion I have come to is that the (post-?) modern Western European lifestyle basically sets us up to be lonely. We compartmentalize our lives to a degree that I haven&#x27;t experienced as much in developing nations. Our work is separate from our &#x27;personal&#x27; life, as are our variety of relationships. Our spouses might have never met our colleagues, our colleagues never met our friends, our friends might never meet our parents, and so on. The result is a fragmented life where you aren&#x27;t automatically part of some community, but where you actively have to maintain individual and group relationships.<p>Another effect is that we can (and might have to) be so many different people in so many different situations, and that we often have to start from scratch because we move, change jobs, break up, and so on. On top of that, we often live alone, and put a big emphasis on our individual goals and happiness.<p>Contrast this with a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; society with many family-run shops, often inside or near the house, huge families that often live in proximity, and a strong sense of responsibility for these family ties. It&#x27;s hard to be lonely in such a situation (although it does exist, and when it does it can be quite severe).<p>I&#x27;ve reached a point where I sometimes wonder if our individualism and emphasis on freedom is worth the drawbacks, of which loneliness is a big one.<p>In my surroundings at least, loneliness needs to be actively fought. And one could argue that the pressure resting on a partnership or starting a family is sometimes too much of a burden, precisely because it is, at least in my world, one of the few remaining approaches (or at least &#x27;convenient&#x27; approaches) to not be alone.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about experimenting with different ways of living together and creating new forms of community. I&#x27;ve seen successful neighbourhood initiatives, for example, where people start interacting more on a local level. I&#x27;ve seen many flatshares that play a part in keeping loneliness away. And I&#x27;ve spent much of my life living in &#x27;communal&#x27; environments that were wonderful, especially growing up.<p>The odd thing about all this is that I am quite solitary and don&#x27;t generally feel lonely. I can easily spend days, even weeks, mostly by myself. And yet this problem bothers me tremendously.<p>I&#x27;ve been rambling and my apologies for any lack of coherence or over-generalizing. Let me end with a quote that hopefully does contribute something. It prescribes what I&#x27;ve personally experienced to be a surefire way to avoid loneliness, and to foster real connections (and fast, often!):<p>&quot;We waste so much energy trying to cover up who we are when beneath every attitude is the want to be loved, and beneath every anger is a wound to be healed and beneath every sadness is the fear that there will not be enough time.<p>When we hesitate in being direct, we unknowingly slip something on, some added layer of protection that keeps us from feeling the world, and often that thin covering is the beginning of a loneliness which, if not put down, diminishes our chances of joy.<p>It’s like wearing gloves every time we touch something, and then, forgetting we chose to put them on, we complain that nothing feels quite real. Our challenge each day is not to get dressed to face the world but to unglove ourselves so that the doorknob feels cold and the car handle feels wet and the kiss goodbye feels like the lips of another being, soft and unrepeatable.&quot;",1389541395

EDRAM is a very good example of something that you just don&#x27;t need an equivalent for - you can emulate all that functionality with regular VRAM just fine.<p>memexport and similar functionality relying on the unified memory architecture is a little more tricky. the real problem i&#x27;d imagine would come from the the resulting &#x27;tricks&#x27; used for performance and flexibility when feeding the GPU from the CPU side - e.g. being able to memcpy into a vertex buffer or blob of shader parameters instead of going through the DX like interface, which was a genuine and useful optimisation. although iirc MS put some limits on this by failing your cert if you did anything outside of their approved list of workarounds for DirectX performance issues... something which is theoretically very easy to check for in many cases<p>i can&#x27;t really see how to workaround that with creating a quite complicated and expensive layer around the memory emulation. for the other features (including memexport) workarounds are possible - if unperformant. memexport is only &#x27;easy&#x27; because it is an optimisation provided to do something you could already do but in a much faster way... (and something which is now &#x27;standard&#x27; since SM4)<p>also, as an aside, i think its worth remembering that whilst the PPC CPUs had lots of advantages for fast execution the memory read/write performance was abysmal compared to contemporaneous Intel PC CPUs and many features like branch prediction (always true iirc) and out-of-order execution were also quite far behind the Intel PC counterparts of the time. Today that gap is even larger - although it is certainly true that other things have become slower, these were never the bottleneck in my experience... it was almost always memory and the poor size and performance of the cache.",1389540999

7046219,comment,7045759,7046157,13,0,stephencanon,,,"In the ARM instruction encoding, <i>every</i> arithmetic and logical instruction is &quot;conditional&quot;.  The destination register is either updated or not depending on the four bit condition field and the state of the condition flags in the processor.<p>As a simple contrived example, consider the following C code:<p><pre><code>    int a[100], b[100], count;\n    ...\n    for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {\n        if (a[i] > b[i]) count++;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwithout conditional execution, one might compile this to code that uses a branch to either increment count or not; on ARM it would be more idiomatic to use conditional execution.  Here&#x27;s a very literal translation as an example (not tested, apologies for any inadvertent errors):<p><pre><code>    // setup: a in R0, b in R1, count in R2, i in R3.\n    loop: LDR   R4, [R0, R3, LSL #2] // load a[i]\n          LDR   R5, [R1, R3, LSL #2] // load b[i]\n          CMP   R4, R5               // if a[i] > b[i]\n          ADDGT R2, R2, #1           //     count++\n          ADD   R3, R3, #1           // i++\n          CMP   R3, #100             // if (i < 100)\n          BLT   loop                 //     continue loop\n</code></pre>\nThe fourth instruction, ADDGT, is <i>conditional</i>.  Count is only updated with the result of the addition if the &quot;greater than&quot; condition is satisfied (the flags were set by the preceding instruction).  To be more precise, all of the instructions here are conditional, it&#x27;s just that for most of them the condition field is 1110, meaning &quot;always&quot;.<p>Many instructions also have an &quot;S&quot; bit, which toggles whether or not they update the flags on which conditional execution depends.  Taken together, these two features allow a clever assembly programmer to do some really clever things (but historically not too much effort has been directed at getting compilers to make really clever use of these features).<p>For low-power parts, this is a cute trick, as it allows a programmer to avoid stressing a limited branch predictor with lots of small branches.  It does add some complication to the implementation however, especially when you get into designs that retire multiple instructions per cycle or support out-of-order execution, as conditional execution basically adds additional dependencies to every instruction.",1389540832

I consider this unhealthy growth.<p>Contrast this with growing your revenue and profit, which I consider healthy growth. If you take funding because you know how you can channel that funding into further revenue and profit, then you&#x27;ve found an excellent reason to take funding. Anything else and you&#x27;re doing yourself and everyone involved with your business a disservice.<p>Yes, if you take funding you will likely grow your employee count, but hopefully you&#x27;ll do so in a precise fashion, with a plan on how those new employees help improve the bottom line of the business.",1389540377

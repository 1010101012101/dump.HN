2448804,comment,2448455,2448629,49,0,pg,,,"While I would never have called YC the new grad school myself, I think you have a mistakenly utopian view of the origins of western higher education.  The ""traditional"" idea of a liberal education you're describing is largely a creation of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Originally higher education was about training priests, lawyers, and doctors.<p>As learning became more prestigious, rich kids started going to universities as well.  They were not there for vocational training.  But they were the newcomers.  The original model of university student was the one Westfall described in his excellent biography of Newton:  ""a plodding group, narrowly vocational in outlook, lower-class youths grimly intent on ecclesiastical preferment as the means to advancement.""<p>If anyone wants to learn more about the origins of universities, I'd recommend Haskins's <i>Rise of the Universities</i>.",1302821769

2448754,comment,2448455,2448682,5,0,rivalis,,,"You're conflating a few things here. This is certainly how higher education started, but in many places it has not remained that way. Some European democracies have made higher education radically affordable, such that citizens can learn to think critically and engage with the issues of living in a modern, information-dense culture.<p>The capitalist function is at odds with this. Job training focused curricula teach practical skills to the detriment of timeless ""enrichment"" subjects. This damages the level of public discourse and is hostile to democracy (well-informed decisions on the part of voting public). It trains people to submit to a corporate environment, instead of enriching their inner life for decades to come.<p>This is why things like YC are excellent: they teach the best of capitalism, ie, leadership, risk-taking, meritocracy.<p>People should be free to determine how many dollars they want to attempt to accumulate relative to other goods. I completely agree that we need to get the price of Higher Ed. in the US under control. I also think that we need to be more up-front about what you can really get out of it: the ""signalling function"" of a degree (<a href=""http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/handicap/honest_economics_05.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/handicap/honest_econom...</a>) is fundamentally wrong-headed and doesn't do anyone much good: it leads middle-class kids who just want a decent credential to waste money on a college that is torn between vocational school and a transformational mission, and employers don't get much in the way of real information about a job applicant from it.<p>Sorry to ramble. I'm just very glad to see this conversation begin to open up; attitudes towards and uses of college degrees are incredibly broken, and it seems like a massive ""re-factoring"" of the whole system (concerns include: civic sophistication, quality of life enrichment, entrepreneurial, vocational-centric) into smaller, more focused parts is what is needed.<p>The serious acceptance of YC and other options like it is the first step along that path. Education is not one-size-fits-all, and we have been telling ourselves that about the ""college"" system for far too long.",1302821052

One, neither of us said that every HN poster is an example of entitlement, but you are claiming that we said that.  Two, you seem to be representing our statements as saying that anyone who is unhappy after finding out their coworker is making more is entitled when instead is upset for money's sake, which I have been specifically maintaining to be a case I have noticed rather than a universal.  Three, while your ""petty losers"" case could certainly be an extreme case of this entitlement, it is a straight up misrepresentation to claim that we're putting it forth as the common case.<p>> So you point out some mythical situation where you think someone would be behaving irrational. What does that have to do with this thread?<p>I think this is most clearly exemplified by the original article (""That dev's salary is higher than mine"") that sparked all of the subsequent ""salary taboo"" threads.  A direct quote from that article:\n""Part of me was even angrier because if he hadnt made this mistake I could be blissfully ignorant and wouldnt have to deal with this mess.""<p>The HN response?  Largely in agreement with the article with very few people, including myself, calling the article out for this and a couple people (including you!) disagreeing with me.<p>> The person's happiness was based on a lie or misunderstanding and the new unhappiness is based on finding out the truth.\nThis is he entitlement of which we are speaking; thank you for making it so explicit.  If your happiness is tied so intricately to the amount of money you receive, that is entitlement.  It would be ridiculous for me to claim that money cannot help achieve happiness, but if you are already happy, finding out you could have potentially had more money should not rationally decrease your happiness.<p>> Leaving money on the table for no other reason than some feeling of happiness is the furthest thing from rational.<p>If your definition of rational is ""attempting to maximise the amount of money I make"" is your definition of rational, sure, but I maintain that is a terrible definition of rationality.  For a very obvious example, if you used that definition, we should all seek the opportunity to work every possible minute at the highest possible rate, the rest of our life be damned.  After all, we need to get more money without worrying about silly things like ""health"" or ""friends and family"" or ""enjoyment of job"" or anything else that really is just ""some feeling of happiness"" at the end of the day.  Since I <i>don't</i> think that either of us subscribe to this view, I think we'd agree that there needs to be some trade-off between money and happiness.<p>However, I'm not talking about leaving money on the table at any rate.  If there exists money I can obtain, I have every right to go after it.  It's being unhappy about the fact I don't have it where we're seeing this irrationality.",1302820540

Higher quality and lower prices (/especially/ lower prices)  are marketing in and of themselves.    For most of the time I've been in business, my model has been to take the marketing costs and just apply those to discounts.<p>Now, this is much easier in the VPS business than in the registrar business, 'cause as far as I can tell, the VPS business is much higher margin.  Really, it's pretty easy, in this market, to differentiate yourself on price, just because retail prices are so much higher than the cost of goods sold.<p>when you sell a .com domain, the lowest your costs can ever be is $6.25 a year (or, at least that's what it was last time I looked)  and the retail prices aren't that much higher than that, so without using domains as a loss leader, it's pretty difficult to differentiate yourself through price.   Heck, considering the margin there, if you have much by way of customer acquisition costs or /any/ customer support costs, you are either charging an uncompetitive rate or you are losing money (and needing to make it up somewhere else)<p>I think the problem with the domain registrar business is that instead of costs being dominated by equipment or something else where you can innovate (or that just automatically becomes dramatically cheaper year over year)  costs are dominated by administrative fees you have to pay the next guy up the chain.",1302820320

I left Germany at the end of 2007 after working for a German domain registrar for nearly 6 years. We were successful (2 million domains under management) and the big ones GoDaddy, NetSol, eNom, Register.com etc. just started registering ccTLDs (country code top-level domains) through us.<p>But something didn't feel right... Domain registrars were getting lots of bad press (frontrunning, parking) and I started thinking of building a new domain management service. In the meantime I moved to Australia and after 6 months of being with an Australian registrar, I had enough. It was time to finally take the plunge. So I moved from Australia to New Zealand where we launched iWantMyName with zero dollar investment in December 2008. I knew one of my co-founders from Germany (luckily he was the former CTO of a registrar back in Germany and had enough of Europe too).<p>The first year was hard. Really fucking hard. We still had to do some consulting jobs to survive and our service could do nothing but register domains. No transfers, only certain DNS record types were supported, no whois updates. But for me it was really surprising how few features people actually need. Our site architecture helps to keep design work at a minimum level too, it's intentionally kept simple. Actually, we don't even have a designer in our team.<p>So where are we now a bit more than 2 years later? Well, we're running a profitable domain management service which generates six figures in revenue. This currently supports three founders, one employee and every single cent that's left will go into improving the user experience. No upselling, no annoying ads, no parking crap, auctions and what have you. We have decided not to compete on price, features or add crappy hosting \nservices but only to give customers what they really need and that is purchasing / managing domains. Having said that, there's still lots of room for improvement and we will not stop until we've build the domain registrar Marco is looking for.",1302820289

That's how universities got started: rich kids, hanging out in fashionable cities, paying scholars a small fee to attend private seminars.

2448671,comment,2447891,2447891,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"My thoughts, based on a few startups I've observed among my friends: once a startup gets to 2-3 full-time founders, the probability that it will fail because people aren't working hard enough goes near zero. The company might fail for other reasons, but once you have 2 or 3 dedicated, full-time founders, ""lack of effort"" is not even on the list of the top 20 things that can kill it. Occasionally, an individual person might drop below acceptable effort levels-- that person usually leaves for a more stable job in a month or two. It just doesn't make sense to work for a startup if you're going to put in a half-hearted effort, so the less committed people usually leave before they become a problem.<p>What I said above is untrue for some 1-person startups that are effectively abandoned, and for startups where people stay in their day jobs and therefore really aren't able to contribute enough to get the thing off the ground. But when you have 2 to 4 people working full-time on a startup, there are still a lot of things that can kill it (bad product, poor team dynamics, bad investor relations, just plain bad luck) but a lack of aggregate effort is very, very low on the list.<p>What seems to be far more common are hours- or sacrifice-related squabbles, and these can utterly break a company. Let's say two founders are working 80 hours per week and one is working 50, but they're all about equally valuable and productive. What happens if, when it's time to split equity, the third founder gets a smaller share? Possible fight. Or worse yet, what if he ends up with lower status within the company and is treated more like an employee, because he didn't ""pull enough weight""? This is where fatal fractures happen. Nothing goes wrong because there wasn't enough effort, and nobody put in such a low level of effort as to cause problems, but the perception of unequal sacrifice and dedication has spawned a very nasty conflict that is destined, at some point in the future, to create a fight that could damage (or ruin) the company.<p>People tend to think of rules surrounding office hours and vacation allotments as exploitative in nature. They can be, but they're also there, in an odd way, to protect people against certain kinds of social dysfunction. Working from home, for example, is great when you have a good working culture, because people can work more productively and are happier. If the environment's dysfunctional, to have people working from home is going to make it a lot worse, because of the distrust that it will breed. In a dysfunctional work environment, it becomes important (until you've made your exit) to be cautious and show up at ""normal"" times, because the perception of working hard becomes more important than actually working hard.",1302819141

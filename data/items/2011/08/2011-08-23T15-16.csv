2917087,comment,2915955,2916438,11,0,bl,,,"Apart from the sheer awe of landing on the moon with that era's technology and the resulting scientific harvest, I am fascinated by the engineering process. I can't settle on whether it was methodically safe or recklessly dangerous. Consider the manned missions timeline:<p>Oct 1968 Apollo 7: earth orbit<p>Dec 1968 Apollo 8: lunar orbit<p>Mar 1969 Apollo 9: earth orbit lunar module docking<p>May 1969 Apollo 10: lunar descent test (no landing)<p>Jul 1969 Apollo 11: lunar landing<p>It seems so composed and laid-out, and at the same time so daring. There is a clearly logical progression there, each mission building on the previous one. But each new mission followed so soon after the previous, and each new mission involved so many new goals. It's wondrous that it just worked out that way with so few missteps. Could they really internalize the lessons? With so many moving parts and subsystems, so many hundreds of thousands of workers, spread across the country in goverment offices and subcontractors, I imagine the safety mindset varied wildly. I know more than a few astronauts certainly conducted themselves recklessly on the ground and in training, and there were large swathes of folk who were fanatical about safety.<p>Perhaps if we had an increased sample size, we'd know which way the Apollo project leaned on safety and methodology. Records show that the NASA administrators were anxious about losing a crew and were all too happy to cancel the missions after Apollo 17 (in addition to saving money for future projects).<p>I heartily recommend Andrew Chaikin's <i>A Man on the Moon</i> for an excellent account of the Apollo program.",1314115109

They're so broad (e.g. check out how broad the definition of ""article"" is) it's like calling a knife, a spoon, a plate, and table all a ""fork"" -- too broad to be useful. Div's are fine. They're all ignored equally by machines.<p>Screen readers also pay zero to no attention to these tags -- heading tags are, however, very much used, but HTML5 intends to supersede that in a completely botched way too. It's not pretty. Also, you would imagine strong and em were useful as opposed to b and i. It turns out most screen readers ignore all of them entirely.<p>Re the parent comment - as for the usefulness of true separation between presentation and content, I find it very promising for A/B testing layout, and therefore a worthy goal, but CSS really needs an actual layout system.",1314114116

The large majority of potential deals never reach that stage but are cancelled much earlier in the process for some reason or other, by the time an acquirer is prepared to put the money on the table for a full dd they are very serious about the deal.<p>As for 'how are you paid', I charge an hourly rate, it's by far the simplest way to make sure that I'm as independent and even keeled as possible.<p>Flat-fees can cause sloppy work (especially if there is more work than anticipated) or over-charging and a percentage of the possible amount (or even a success fee) would either be a bad match (because under $100K investment due diligence is usually very much abbreviated and on the high end the work is usually not that much more than in the middle).<p>Especially success fees are bad because this causes the due diligence to shift from being somewhat skeptical about claims to ignoring aspects of the target just to let a deal go through.<p>I find that regular 'hourly rates' are the best match for this kind of work, it means that if a due diligence unexpectedly costs more time (which you have relatively little control over as the person doing dd, after all the supply of information and transparency are not under your control but have a huge impact on the amount of time required) or if there is a large amount of material to absorb or extra areas of interest as dictated by the acquirer that there is no lack of motivation to do the work.<p>Of course, there will be plenty of parties that disagree with this, I'm aware of people and companies that do 'fixed fee' (but at a price point significantly higher than what I charge), and also of people operating on a 'success fee' basis but I'm just not comfortable with either of those.<p>Fee and work done should be in some sort of relationship to each other, 'value created' is hard to establish since that is mostly dependent on the deals that <i>don't</i> go through!<p>Personally, I'm most happy if I don't create 'value' but if everything the target claimed was found to be the truth and there is little or no friction.<p>As for the absolute amounts, a full legal, financial and technical due diligence can cost anywhere from 20K 'credits' to several 100K depending on the size of the target and the various requirements as made by the acquirer, especially financial can cost a very large amount of money in the case of a company with a long commercial history.<p>That's also why 'acquirer pays for dd' is a good principle.<p>One variation on this that I've seen is that if the deal falls through that the acquirer will pay for dd and if the deal gets executed that the dd costs will be paid from the investment.<p>I hope that answers your questions in sufficient detail.",1314113896

I'll provide references for both.<p>The easy answer is that this behavior is ""heritable,"" that is that correlations in rank order on this dimension of behavior are stronger for close relatives than for persons who are not close relatives. That is true of ALL human behaviorial characteristics, without exception. A genetically sensitive study design on any human behavioral characteristic from political behavior (who is ""conservative"" and who is ""liberal"") to obesity to IQ will always show a broad heritability greater than 0 (and always strictly less than 1). Everything that people do is heritable.<p>The hard answer is that even if a human behavior is shown to be heritable, as all human behaviors are, it still remains unknown how much the behavior is subject to environmental influences. Some human behavioral characteristics with high observed heritabilities are nonetheless highly sensitive to environmental influences. Most human behavioral characteristics are polygenic, that is they are influenced by many genes, each with a small effect, and even monozygotic twins are consistently found to differ in highly heritable characteristics, for environmental reasons that are sometimes still quite poorly understood. Knowing the heritability of a human behavioral characteristic says nothing about how much that characteristic is subject to environmental influences.<p>Here are the references I promised, recent papers by world-famous behavioral geneticists:<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20(2008).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20(2009).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p>To sum up, in the context of this thread, a LONG-TERM trend of women having fewer children might be expected to reduce the reproduction most of women who have some genetic propensity to disfavor having children. But all women of all shuffles of the genes respond to societal and individual incentives to have more or fewer children, with few of those incentives yet being well understood. It is certainly possible in principle to reduce the trend toward reduced reproduction, irrespective of which persons (with which genomes) are reproducing.",1314113312

2916918,comment,2916102,2916102,12,0,cek,,,"In my time at Microsoft I drove technical due diligence for potential acquisitions many times. This is a solid article but I'd like to add a few points from my experience.<p>I have to admit that I view my track-record in engaging in M&A activity during my career at Microsoft as almost perfect. Out of the dozen M&As I was involved in only ONE actually closed with an acquisition; the rest Microsoft walked away from.  I view this as successful because I was never the biz-dev guy, always the technical guy. I'm quite sure my biz-dev colleagues felt the opposite about our ""success rate"" because, at large companies biz-dev people involved in ""corp dev"" or ""M&A"" activities are typically measured, at least in part, on how many deals they complete a deals a year. When I was doing this I never actually had any written commitments/goals for M&A work. It was just something I got roped into/volunteered to do.  And I always took the principled approach.<p>As a guy driving due diligence I viewed it as my job to find all the skeletons in the closet <i>ahead of time</i> that would make the deal impossible for Microsoft to swallow. I'm not saying that all the deals MS didn't do that I was involved in were due to <i>my</i> work; they weren't.  But a few were.  I found some serious skeletons.<p>The skeletons I found had to do with three things, which were also the things I explicitly tried to uncover:<p>1) Horrific code quality.<p>2) Weak people.<p>3) Improperly licensed 3rd party code.<p>You can imagine how I uncovered details on each of these. In some cases #2 was the hardest to accomplish because interviewing employees of an acquisition target is actually very hard. The target often does not want employees to know it is a target early on in the process.  One reason is what would happen if the deal did not go through: The employees would know (and probably leak) that a major Co. had attempted the acquisition and turned away.  This could be devastating to the target company. When we did interview target company engineers we often found shockingly bad engineers.<p>Reviewing the code (and often just as importantly the engineering system) was always the most revealing (and damning). Engineering debt creeps up on a lot of small companies and, in cases where the deal is to ""buy code"", is a deal breaker.<p>The thing that we had the biggest allergic reaction, however, was #3 above: Improperly licensed 3rd party code.<p>Many of the acquisitions I was involved in were associated with Windows in some way. The risk to having Windows being contaminated by either commercial code that was not clearly licensed or by open source code with a license like GPLv2 was huge.  And we found it all the time.  Initially it was shocking to me how these small companies were so cavalier about plagiarizing code with no thought about the consequences; especially given these companies clearly had long term strategies of being acquired at some point!<p>So add to this great article the following pieces of advice:<p>1) Set your hiring bar high and be hard-core about managing poor performers. Remember the maxim that As hire As, Bs hire Cs, and Cs hire Ds.<p>2) Invest in reducing your engineering debt, particularly in the areas of your code where a potential acquirer is going to find the most value.<p>3) If you use 3rd party code, or open source, take the time to ensure you are using it in a way that is compatible with potential acquiring companies.

His point was not that applications that use STM and make use of a single thread are slower than sequential implementations of the same application.<p>And the experience has been exactly the same in locks-based GIL-removal tests in Python: David Beazley recently ""unearthed"" and tested a GIL-removal patch from the 1.4 days[0]...<p>> To test threads, I wrote a small sample that subdivided the work across two worker threads is an embarrassingly parallel manner (note: this code is a little wonky due to the fact that Python-1.4 doesn't implement thread joining--meaning that you have to do it yourself with the included binary-semaphore lock).<p>> [...]<p>> If you run this code with the GIL, the execution time is about 2.5 seconds or approximately 1.3 times slower than the single-threaded version (1.9 seconds). Using the GIL-less Python, the execution time is 18.5 seconds or approximately 1.45 times slower than the single-threaded version (12.7 seconds). Just to emphasize, the GIL-less Python running with two-threads is running more than 7 times slower than the version with a GIL.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-remova...</a>",1314111681

That&#x27;s the endpoint you&#x27;re looking for. This undoes all the layers of the onion in one move.

In a sense this is sort of like catching a soon to be T2D in the pre-diabetic phase and telling them to eat less and run more. (There is no offense intended in that previous statement; with an obese pre-diabetic (type 2) it is possible to stop the disease before things are too late through exercise and diet, this is not the case in with a Type 1).<p>This makes me question if this is an effective treatment ONLY when caught early; or if it could be useful for long time diabetics like myself.<p>Also this treatment addresses beta cell replacement which is one side, but it doesn&#x27;t address the autoimmune side which is actually causing the beta cell destruction in the first place.  So would this be a lifetime pill that is taken to continuously build new beta cells?  As I see it in the autoimmune T1D case as the beta cells remain under attack this would not be a &quot;cure&quot; per se, but rather an ongoing treatment that would result in an overall better outcome and quality of life for a diabetic (given it works at all).",1415366684

The approval process is painfully slow.<p>As a concrete example, there&#x27;s a new class of immune therapy drugs used in the treatment of melanoma, among them PD-1 inhibitors and Ipilimumab. The data for these has been around for years, they are known to offer some kind of response in about a quarter of patients. In a small percentage of patients, there has been complete response and they&#x27;ve been disease free for years. This is unheard of in metastatic melanoma (stage IV has a 10% 5-year survival rate).<p>Dying of melanoma, by the way, is not a pretty death, there&#x27;s nothing dignified or natural about how melanoma kills. It&#x27;s something out of a horror movie. Dying early of liver failure would is a walk in the park compared to what a terminal patient has to look forward to.<p>In any case, the point is moot, because not only are PD-1 and its ilk more effective, but the side effects in trial patients have been minimal compared to the destructive known effects of chemo and radiation (or golf-ball sized bleeding tumors cropping up in your intestines).<p>I invite you to visit any melanoma forum and read the backlogs. You can read through years of people going through horrific treatments, all of which, again, are known to not be effective (biochemo, interferon, surgeries, whole brain radiation once the cancer spreads to the brain), while desperately applying for studies for drugs that are out there and already showing positive results. Then they suffer. A lot.

So if a browser does not ship with, for example, array.map() itself, a polyfill can do array.map = function() {} and implement it.<p>That way, a developer can simply use array.map and not have to do a different implementation (fall back on a ye olde for-loop).",1415365905

It turns out that even in cases where you don&#x27;t have some massively distributed, scalable needs, there are a lot of cases to use Erlang. While it makes insanely difficult problems tractable, it can also make moderately challenging problems simple (and it sometimes can make simple tasks irritating; see usual list of Erlang complaints).<p>Just about any sort of web backend (that isn&#x27;t having to do a whole lot of number crunching), any sort of interaction with hardware, handling/transport of binary data (as mentioned above), and of course any time you need reliability, it&#x27;s worth considering.<p>But even in areas where there&#x27;s not an obvious win, a lot of problems that are traditionally done in a single threaded manner can be made simpler in a concurrent language like Erlang.<p>An example I like to give is time based task scheduling. In a traditional language, you&#x27;d implement something like that with a priority queue. Which is fine, but you have a lot of work. First, what happens if timings change? You have to rejigger -everything-. What happens if you have multiple tasks at the same time? You need a threadpool or similar to dispatch these things onto. What happens if one task itself creates a new task for a later time? You&#x27;ll have multiple people adding things onto the priority queue, so now you need to start locking. And of course, since you&#x27;ve got your dispatching process sleeping until the next task is to start, you have to make sure any time you modify the queue, you remember to notify that sleeping task, so it can update as necessary. There is a lot to get wrong.<p>In Erlang? You spin up a separate process for each task, with a timer. Done (with caveats; you likely will need to persist the task information and load it periodically into a task+timer process, but that&#x27;s pretty trivial).<p>A similar case can be made for functional compared to a more procedural approach. That&#x27;s a little too long winded for here, but even examples that seem -ideal- for OO, can oftentimes be described more simply in a functional, data-centric manner, and future refactorings are made simpler as well in doing so.",1415365422

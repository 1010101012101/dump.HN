Japan railways itself split into several separate companies upon privatization.<p>This would never happen in Tokyo. As much as we think of the country as being monolithic (in many ways it is), there are great differences between different regions of the country (much like any country).<p>Tokyo is a place where a train being 2 minutes late causes ire (and a train conductor once killed himself for a mistake as trivial as this). It&#x27;s a place where if a person jumps into the train to kill themselves, many will curse under their breaths about being late to work. It&#x27;s a place where if you faint in the train concourse during the morning rush hour, no one will stop to help you. It&#x27;s a place where young mothers with strollers are given stinkeye on public transit. If you ask someone (in fluent Japanese) to take a photo for you, you will often be completely ignored.

10870128,comment,10858771,10864296,0,0,ycombobreaker,,,"A Leveraged ETF is designed to amplify (and possibly invert) the daily returns relative to some benchmark.  So for example, SPY is the &quot;normal&quot; ETF which tracks the S&P 500 index.  UPRO is a triple-leveraged ETF which is designed to get 3x the daily returns (gains or losses) of the S&P 500, using the same amount of capital.  Some other ETFs are leveraged and inverse, meaning they will gain value when the index loses value, and vice-versa.  In general, day-trading these ETFs is a way for small traders to increase the leverage on their bet.  However, there is always some sort of &quot;friction&quot; with using leverage in this way, which causes the all leveraged ETFs to slowly lose value over time.  Intuitively, you could say that you taking out a tiny loan in order to increase your bet, and the friction is just interest payments.  Maybe somebody else can explain some more technical details, if you are interested (I recommend financial blogs such as Kid Dynamite&#x27;s on these types of topics).<p>Here are some examples of levered ETFs... sorry, it seems most web UIs are interactive and actively resist linking to a customized chart.  I&#x27;ll link to the benchmark.  You&#x27;ll need to click &quot;Compare&quot; and enter the two leveraged ETFs, be sure to check the &quot;Display as a Percent Change&quot; option, and then mess with the duration (from 1D through 5Y is illustrative).  You can see that daily or short-term returns are inverted relative to each other, but long-term returns (6 months or more) are net negative across every pair of ETFs.<p>Crude oil: UWTI is 3x, DWTI is 3x inverse.

10870112,comment,10813543,10821408,0,0,paul_milovanov,,,"One thing that comes to mind is that for any former USSR country geopolitical considerations come into play. Unless you&#x27;re willing to spend more money on this than Russia is willing to and able to procure other resources that Russia has readily available (military, etc), you&#x27;re done.<p>More generally speaking, even as a thought experiment, the main obstacle is that the actual corruption is the tip of the iceberg -- or the flower that blooms from the plant and the roots of a civil society that operates in such a way. I don&#x27;t know whether anybody ever succeeded in changing civic culture from the top down. I&#x27;d be surprised and I&#x27;d expect that this would require the use of violence unacceptable to anyone that minds corruption. My guess is that the only way towards a healthier social culture is evolutionary.<p>I think that the only way strong civil societies ever developed historically is in the conditions of gradually increasing prosperity or at least the standard of living above subsistence that gives the luxury of a bit of toil-free time and that little extra buffer of security that you&#x27;re not constantly under the immediate risk of being hungry and homeless tomorrow if something goes wrong. \nIn a man eat man environment, you do what you have to do to survive. There&#x27;s significant evidence with multiple meta-analyses at this point that anxiety has strong effects on attention and cognitive performance (e.g <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08917779108248762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08917779108248762</a>). There&#x27;s a good reason why, as per de Tocqueville&#x27;s astute observation, revolutions occur not when bad conditions get worse, but when gradually improving conditions suddenly become worse.<p>The slightly better-off and the rich face different issues. Multiple studies suggest that the rich in societies with high inequality are a lot more anxious and less satisfied with their life. It&#x27;s easy to imagine why that might be -- the costs of falling down the food chain in a highly unequal society are very serious, and the perceived threat from the have-nots is substantial. (Now, inequality in a society where the lowest incomes are far above the living wage is probably far less of a problem.)<p>Ancient Greece & Mediterranean, pre-industrial Britain and other European countries after the population-culling blessing of the Black Plague (I&#x27;m not kidding), the US, fertile North & South of China before and after 0 AD all had conditions of some sort that made starting down this road of growth a bit easier.<p>It&#x27;s of course a catch-22. We don&#x27;t really know how to engineer strong civil societies and prosperity, for all our chest-beating. The evidence is abundant. Because of that, I think that we ought to be a lot less dismissive about &quot;increased standard of living without freedom&quot; that China is often accused of. I think we know of many more examples of prosperity producing strong civil societies than the inverse.",1452314535

We are stuck.<p>We need to design algos that can do a lot of different tasks and not just one like playing chess also these algo should be able to extend their capability rather than redesigning them. Hmmm lets use general purpose &quot;search&quot; algos (LOGIC programming) and also feed lot of &quot;knowledge&quot; into the algo as input. Yay we got expert system and they almost looks like thinking. Let&#x27;s see what else can we use them to do and someone shouts &quot;lets see if they can recognize image&quot;, dammit that&#x27;s so hard to &quot;represent&quot; using &quot;knowledge bases&quot;. We are stuck.<p>Lot&#x27;s of people kept working on how to &quot;represent&quot; the algo and inputs for the problem of image classification and similar problems. Came up with various &quot;machine learning algos&quot; including &quot;deep learning&quot; algos which seems to work really really well but of course they have their own demands like huge amount of data and computing power etc. But are they really &quot;thinking&quot; ??? They can be easily fooled, they are like black boxes nobody can extract some useful knowledge from trained network such that it can be used somewhere else just like general purpose knowledge we humans have. This is the latest shiny thing as of now. But we don&#x27;t have general purpose AI yet.<p>We always want silver bullet and we always hope that we will get there by creating hype but in the end the hype dies and people move on to next hype.",1452313536

When you are considering mobile development, I think you need to seriously think about two factors.  (I have written a couple of Cordova apps and a book about the Cordova CLI.)<p>1. Is there on device functionality that will be hard or clunky to access via Cordova.  In my experience, maps are one of these features, especially moveable maps.  This can force you towards native dev.<p>2. Do you need a mobile app at all?  The folks at forecast.io have built a killer webapp that feels like a native app.  Do you need offline features, access to the contacts list, etc.  Are you prepared to market your app, which is far harder to do than marketing a webapp (app store downloads being harder to obtain than webpage visits)?<p>Lots of folks think they need an app, but really would benefit from a well designed webapp.<p>Note, from a glance, it seems like the author made the right choice aboiy Cordova for their use case.",1408363194

It&#x27;s actually a really bad idea, though, for a couple of reasons:<p>* Your support site will be flooded by pirates experiencing the degredation if it is severe enough to be noticed\n* People will just assume it is a bug and your game sucks if it&#x27;s subtle\n* If it&#x27;s very blatant it will be removed in the pirated versions. Meanwhile you run the risk of it happening to legitimate customers due to bugs in the DRM.<p>Why should you care that pirates think your game sucks? Well, for one, on the great democracy that is the internet, pirates&#x27; game reviews have just as much weight as legitimate purchasers. Also a pirate is not necessarily always a pirate, they may be trying before they buy, or may convert to a paying customer later in life and remember their experience with your company.",1408362986

(2) The extremely dodgy circumstances around how the women actually got to the police have been published (one of them, who previously worked for a CIA-linked company, took the other one) (3) The extremely dodgy circumstances around how the police interviews were conducted (&quot;we&#x27;ll write down what we think you&#x27;re saying&quot; instead of &quot;we&#x27;ll record what you&#x27;re saying&quot;) (4) The express wishes of the woman in question (re: &quot;I don&#x27;t want any of this disclosed&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to press any charges&quot;) were ignored by the police (5) The woman who took the other woman to the police knew the police officer in question (6) The case was totally thrown out of court (7) The case was replaced in court partly due to the involvement of a lawyer who is also a politician (8) Leading human rights organizations, EU lawyers, Sweden&#x27;s own bar association and similar elevated persons have united against the handling of the case. (9) Assange got explicit permission to leave Sweden before doing so (10) The prosecutor in the case has neither interviewed him remotely nor explained why she doesn&#x27;t do so, except to suggest he&#x27;s guilty until proven innocent - ie. should be in Sweden when questioned - so he can be locked up!

There&#x27;s three parts:<p>* KDE Frameworks 5, which is a modularized, tiered set of libraries and runtime components that complement Qt with functionality useful to building apps and shells.<p>* KDE Plasma 5, a set of shells implemented using Frameworks 5. Plasma Desktop is the most prominent of those. KWin is part of Plasma, FWIW, so sure, it&#x27;s at 5 now.<p>* KDE Applications. Not yet at 5, but will increasingly ship ports of individual applications to KF5 over the next releases.<p>Contrast this with KDE 4 development. KDE 4.0 (which contained all of these things in one) came years after the last major release of KDE 3, thus stopping the world cold for its entire development cycle, and e.g. preventing apps from doing feature releases. Separating these things and releasing them independently means that Plasma continued to make 4.x releases during ramp-up of Frameworks 5 development, KDE Applications kept doing feature releases while Plasma 5 is materializing, and so on. It&#x27;s just a lesson learned from the last round. It&#x27;s certainly more complex from a &quot;SKU&quot; perspective, but the net effect on users is not leaving them stranded for years. The effect on developers has actually been increased productivity: Plasma 5 development happening against already somewhat-stable Frameworks 5 instead of starting out at the same time, for example.",1408360637

Furthermore, how accurate were their queries (i.e. did they quantify them)?<p>- the results they got from Scopus depended heavily on what they queried for (as mentioned in a previous comment).

I can&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t report results for these other ranges, especially when they were already doing automated analysis.

Here was someone I've never heard of - and I'm pretty active at getting around the startup world; someone who seems to have got herself into a web of lies which probably started off with some exaggerations.<p>Let's stipulate to the fact that it's not okay to lie about yourself to get a gig, even if you think it's harmless and you'll make up for it in work.  I thought it was right that the Yahoo! CEO was fired for that stuff.  I've never lied on a resume, never would.<p>But what we have here is a nobody, who's probably got a bit of a problem.  That problem is exacerbated by the bullshit celebrity culture TechCrunch tries to build around our industry.  It's the bullshit attitude displayed by a ton of the current incubator ducklings, who follow their angels around in awe like momma duck, while convincing themselves they're starring the fantasy version of Silicon Valley they saw in the Social Network.  TechCrunch is among the worst offenders creating this problem.<p>If we're going to be honest about it, there are plenty of folks - and we don't need to get ugly and name names but if you're around the industry you bump into these people - who call themselves Tech Journalists who are little more than exaggerators, fabricators and bullshit artists who have NEVER CREATED ANYTHING OF VALUE themselves, never created a job, never taken the risk.  Just the role of the critic.  Never the man in the arena.  So it's a bit rich them all ganging up on this unfortunate person who tied herself up in knots and exaggerations leading to great embarrassment.<p>(Try going to any event full of tech journalists from these blogs and wait till they get a bit drunk and listen to the boasts and stories and thoroughly inappropriate behavior.)<p>But I have NO sympathy for any startup that works with someone without doing the most basic of background checks which would immediately expose lies and exaggerations.  The valley is full of people who overstate things and word gets around pretty quickly.  You can often see the smoke and smell the charcoal from burning bridges from a long distance, and way after the fact.  No public interest is served by tarring and feathering a nobody for entertainment purposes under the guise of investigative journalism.<p>The way this story is written you'd think they'd uncovered Carlos the Jackal, cracked a terrorist ring, discovered the whereabouts of Nazi war criminals.  It is pathetic and mean spirited.<p>I keep hoping TechCrunch will recapture what once made it a must-read, but I'm increasingly saddened by the reality that it won't happen.  As I've posted elsewhere, it's a serious thing that we do here in Silicon Valley, building companies, taking risks.  We often spend large sums of other people's money.  We commit our lives and those of our loved ones to the endeavor.  Sure we can have fun.

One third of young African American men are in prison, on probation or on parole. Ours is the only country in the world that gives life sentences to 13 year olds. As for the death penalty, one out of nine defendants sentenced to death have been exonerated.  in California a billion dollars will be spent defending and executing the death penalty in the next 5 years, although a referendum is on its way to re-direct those funds to police enforcement budgets.<p>What made the talk great was Stevenson's ability to weave in his personal stories, recounting memories of what it was like to grow up among activists like Rosa Parks. There was so much enthusiasm for Stevenson and his cause that TED Curator Chris Andersen jumped on the occasion to solicit donations for Stevenson's private foundation.

They also have a distorted view...""<p>cletus you are one of the few people with enough karma to always grab and hold a top post spot who _actually says things worth saying_.<p>Right on.<p>As for ""someone with the gravitas"", never say never.  But they might not use the Linux kernel and GNU as their ""clay"" or ""base material"".<p>I've thought about such a person and one thing I believe is that they would be foolish to try to ""sell"" such a simple to use system to Linux users (and many of those users would, alas, include engineers like the ones you describe: set in their ways) nor to those engineers who worship Apple, with their belief in some mythical ""user experience"" [translation: _their_ experience]).<p>In my opinion, a person with the gravitas would also need to the vision to see that the target user base who is open to change lies elsewhere.  The users need to come with an open mind.<p>I don't know what will happen to Linux.  But the binary blob problem keeps getting worse.  Too many Linux users are happy to accept the blobs.  They don't want to read source code.  They just want working devices.  That's understandable. But in my opinion it's not a small problem in the long run.<p>Apple, on the other hand, is flat out abusing its power.  Not only over end users but over developers (who are of course just a particular class of end users).  They are standing in the way of people's general education about computers.  Keeping everyone dumb may give some developers a warm, fuzzy feeling as they watch their bank accounts grow to new levels, or dream of it, but I do think Apple's conduct, seen for what it is, will trickle down past just us fanatics on HN and elsewhere on the web.  People are going to figure it out.<p>If I was a monopoly-lover, if I loved to see ""winner-take-all"" in IT, as if that improved the lot for any of us (I am not and it doesn't), then my money would go on Amazon.  They seem to be making the fewest mistakes.  Great things will come from AWS.  It is the democratisation of hosting - a sharing of power, risks be damned (unfortunately, it may also mean the monopolisation of hosting as we've never before seen).  In ""Dropbox"", we are only seeing the very beginning of what's possible.<p>In my view, Apple is a ""disabler"" (everything they introduce is restricted)  while Amazon is an ""enabler"" (generally: they open many more doors than they close).",1346288532

I wish Couchbase hadn't abandoned the Apache version, or rather, I wish someone else had stepped in to take their place as ""the Couch company"" the same way 10gen is for Mongo.<p>Cloudant is close, but their BigCouch stuff still isn't merged yet as far as I know, so if you go with them you're still using some weird Couch fork instead of the open source version. Which might be more of a psychological problem than an actual one, but it makes me really uneasy about the Couch ecosystem they're the only thing we have that's close to a gold-standard champion.",1346288514

SOX doesn't literally specify any of this sort of stuff.<p>In my experience, SOX usually ends up meaning that developers don't have access to production systems, or significantly limited access.  However, a continuous deployment system should generally be very much in the spirit of SOX, in that it's pretty hard to do without well-defined, highly-repeatable, automated and auditable processes.",1346288431

The first situation happens when you file an application but the patent office determines that there are two distinct inventions being claimed, and so want to examine the novelty of each separately.  At least that's my understanding; IANAL.<p>How did you find these?  If someone pointed you to them, I think they were trying to mislead you.

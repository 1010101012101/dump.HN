1016114,comment,1016003,1016003,0,0,btilly,,,"The article makes a number of major mistakes that discredit its whole thesis.<p>1. My source for the productivity figure is <i>Peopleware</i>.  They cite a set of ""coding war games"" that found a repeatedly measured 10x variation between the best and the worst programmers in their work environment.  The productivity difference showed up under a variety of different measurements.  There is no vagueness about the measurement techniques or doubt about the figure.<p>2. The 10x figure was from best to worst, from best to median was (IIRC) 2.6 times.<p>3. A significant portion of the figure they measured was correlated with environment, and the strongest predictor of performance was the performance of your coworkers.  That said their study technique couldn't tell the difference between whether environment attracted the best people, or whether environment caused people to become more productive.  (From the point of view of a smart employer there isn't too much difference between those hypotheses.)<p>4. People accept compensation in many ways, and not all of them involve money.  I believe that the better a programmer is, the more apt they are to be willing to trade salary for better work environment, more interesting co-workers, more interesting problems, etc.  As a concrete example I have heard anecdotes from many people claiming that people are willing to accept sometimes substantial pay cuts for the privilege of working at Google.<p>5. Whatever the cause, in the <i>Peopleware</i> study the difference in pay between the top and bottom half of programmers was less than 10%.  Furthermore productivity was basically uncorrelated with various factors people look at in the hiring process such as years of experience.  That is direct evidence that it is a bad idea to measure productivity by salary.<p>When you put all of these factors together, you simply can't point to market forces then salaries to discount real performance differences between working programmers.",1261849942
1016113,comment,1015591,1015591,0,0,fragmede,,,"The author reads pg's statement that ""People will pay for information they think they can make money from."" and hears the negative - people /won't/ pay for information they /can't/ make money from. That setup is then used to conclude: Buy (other people's) stuff via my Amazon Affiliate link. Feh.<p>People will pay for content, they just don't know it. But really, what people is that? The people reading the content, or people reaching out to content readers. The current foregone conclusion is the latter, and everything-ad supported is proof of that. The same people paying for AND reading the content being one in the same is the exception. Consumer Reports, Wall Street Journal and PBS are the only three that immediately come to mind.

1016105,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,Mz,,,"I'm female and have a social sciences background. I ended up with a Certificate in GIS due to an interest in Urban Planning. Somewhere along the way, I learned to write a little (X)HTML and CSS as a means to more effectively share information by running my own websites.  This grew out of participating in email lists where my ideas on certain topics were popular for a time.  I would get tired of repeating myself and then make a webpage so I could link to it and make a few custom remarks via email instead of feeling like I was reinventing the wheel all the time.<p>More recently, I have decided I would like to learn a programming language to write a simulation, again for the purpose of more effectively sharing information.  For a variety of reasons, I have yet to get started on learning a programming language.  But I keep getting interested in more technical stuff to serve my other interests that are still more social sciences based.  I joined Hacker News in part because having people to talk to about a topic of interest works well for me as an intro to a topic.  Taking classes on it would not currently fit into my life.<p>Good luck with this.",1261849403

After that, he got me a copy of VisualBasic which was much too visual for my tastes but kept me tinkering a while. I also got a copy of Borland C++ Builder at a relatively early age but made precious little good use of it. Around that time, WWW was coming out so I started following web technologies sand playing with JavaScript. My HS chem professor had us do an informational interview with someone in our field, which I did and was offered a job where I started doing HTML/JS/CC work from photoshop templates. I also did networking and picked up on Java there. That's really all she wrote, in the last 12 years I don't think I've gone more than 2 weeks without writing some Java. I still prefer dynamic languages and I can't help but want to dump functions into variables, but it's comfortable and does what I want... plus I can do fun things in JS or AS3 on the front end.",1261849355

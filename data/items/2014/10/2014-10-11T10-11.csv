The health benefits to the city are huge (as well as reducing congestion) and you get people of all ages cycling now.<p>In Australia where helmets are a legal requirement, city cycle schemes are failing, but this may also be to do with a lack in building out segregated cycle infrastructure as part of these schemes. It is still a mainly hardcore, male activity there.<p>The point is, helmets and cycling create flame wars with anecdotal evidence in favour &quot;how it saved my life&quot; and the response being that the health benefits to society of cycling far out weigh the risks of not wearing one (i.e. It&#x27;s calculated in the UK, that a helmet law would kill 235 people per year more through obesity related deaths).<p>When I trundle to the shops or pop into town I wear a cap (being bald brings it&#x27;s own problems), but should I go out on a club ride or go off-roading I wear a helmet as the risk of falling off is higher. I also wear one when I&#x27;m out after dark.<p>Wear one if you want, don&#x27;t wear one. Just make sure you are out there riding. The health risks far outweigh the perceived risk of falling off your bike.<p>The real problem isn&#x27;t helmets, it&#x27;s the lack of segregating cycles from pedestrians and motorised vehicles. Making people feel safe cycling to and from shops, homes, schools and their place of work.",1413024101

8441794,comment,8441671,8441671,0,0,jdmitch,,,"As an avid, but fairly aggressive cyclist, I have gotten into a fair number of accidents. Some of the injuries sustained, and the ways in which other injuries would have been likely without a helmet in those situations, have convinced me that many of these studies don&#x27;t take into account some very common situations in accidents. Direct head impacts are relatively uncommon, due to natural instincts to protect oneself. More common are:<p>- Side impact from vehicles turning across the bicycle lane. This is the most common cause of fatalities in road accidents in London, and if the vehicle is going at speed, nothing can be done with or without a helmet. Usually, however, the vehicle is slowing to turn, or just clips the rider who hasn&#x27;t had time to react. When this happened to me, I banged into the side of the van which was cutting me off, and my helmet kept my head from hitting the vehicle, likely right at the temple, which could have caused significant damage.<p>- Unintended dismount. I find a huge number of &quot;accidents&quot; are really accidents that were just barely prevented by a quick manoeuver, which often leaves the cyclist on the ground. I have avoided collisions quite frequently, but still ended up doing a little barrel roll off the bike. In these cases, I may not be moving fast, but it is nice knowing my helmet will keep me from a kerb to the head.<p>-Scrapes and abrasions. This is the most painful injury, and one of my most gruesome accidents involved a nasty abrasion on my face - had I not been wearing a helmet, it would have probably meant about half of my scalp was rubbed off as well, so very happy to have been wearing a helmet in that instance.<p>The &quot;crash test dummy&quot; proof that we don&#x27;t need helmets doesn&#x27;t stack up in my experience because I think a confident cyclist is more likely to have oblique and &quot;minor&quot; accidents rather than major direct collisions, and major head trauma is just not going to be prevented by a $40 piece of foam and plastic.",1413024042

You say that you didn&#x27;t get any updates on Debian, yet you say that it looks like Debian may have applied something.<p>As I explained above, the patch for CVE-7169 by Florian Weimer made bash invulnerable to code injection by arbitrary environment variables. The underlying bugs CVE-6277 and CVE-6278 therefore have no known attack vector <i>from outside bash,</i> though they can still be triggered from a shell script or the command line if they are not patched. Theoretically, they could become part of a different attack, so it&#x27;s wise to patch them, but there&#x27;s no hurry, since as long as you or Debian have applied the abovementioned patch for CVE-7169, it means there&#x27;s currently no publicly-known exploit.<p>Also, Debian uses dash as its version of sh, so the problem can only occur if bash is called explicitly.",1413023798

As evidence, this quote from the article:<p><pre><code>   Indeed, Ballmer seemed to have no intention of leaving when he announced a 
   massive reorganization of the entire company in July 2013. Behind the scenes 
   he had also begun negotiating an acquisition that was meant to transform 
   Microsoft. He had become convinced that the company had to make hardware 
   too. The reason why goes back to his chart. The two companies which have 
   seen the greatest increases in the share of profits they take are Apple and 
   Samsung, particularly Apple, whose share of the technology industry’s 
   profits leapt from 7 percent in 2008 to 21 percent in 2013. To Ballmer, the 
   message was clear, and so, in December 2012, he began talking to the Finnish 
   smartphone-maker, Nokia, whose C.E.O., Stephen Elop, had worked at 
   Microsoft. There was a defensive reason for the deal as well as an offensive 
   one. Nokia was pretty much the only company left that was making Windows 
   phones. If Nokia went under, what would happen to Microsoft’s phone business?
</code></pre>
Apple and Samsung&#x27;s phone businesses are entirely different.  Apple is selling ios to the high and middle end market.  Samsung is getting devoured from the bottom, because there is very little difference between android oems, whereas Apple doesn&#x27;t need (or want!) the bottom.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing that someone like Ballmer wouldn&#x27;t see that coming, given that Xiaomi and the other chinese competitors are running a classic competitive playbook on Samsung.<p>Stratechery has written about this at length, though I don&#x27;t recall if it was clearly discussed in a single article or my mental synthesis from a collection.

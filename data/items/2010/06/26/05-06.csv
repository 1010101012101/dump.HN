There is no recovery, this is economic reality.<p>It's going to take a lot of hard work for the economy to actually reach the pre-2008 levels.<p>I'd suggest we use the great minds in finance to produce value instead of hocus pocus. The levels from which we are basing the recovery were not real. It is the result of producing money out of thin air, hence when everyone wants it back it is not there to give back. That has nothing to do with educational attainment and everything to do with fraud.

1463202,comment,1462675,1462758,0,0,dlytle,,,"There's been a really strong and justified precedent set for using regulation for this; drunk driving.  In fact, regulation for impaired elderly drivers may be even more justified than it is for drunk driving.  (I'm not defending drunk drivers, here, just to get that out of the way.  Driving while drunk is an incredibly stupid decision.)<p>Drunk drivers are only impaired some of the time, whereas many elderly drivers are impaired all the time.  Because of this, it's possible to test, <i>in advance</i>, whether or not an elderly driver is safe behind the wheel.  You can't give a drunk a sobriety test every 12 months to certify them safe to drive; you could do that for elderly drivers.<p>Enforcing testing for elderly drivers also has the advantage of being a largely preventative measure, rather than a punitive one.  The demographic it targets is also more likely to obey or respect that law, generally has more options for free or cheap transit, and is likely to be more deterred by the prospect of a sentence.<p>The downside, of course, is that being old is not a preventable condition; ompaired elderly drivers don't go out to the Frothing Otter on weeknights for bottled arthritis.  Drunk driving can be easily demonized because the drunk driver made a choice to be impaired.  The elderly can't be demonized for being too old or crippled, so it would be hard to push anything through.  They're also extremely sympathetic defendants.<p>Elderly driving certification is certainly bad PR.  But it's as justified as the original drunk driving laws.  (Original meaning before they evolved into the nightmare they are today.)",1277531213

If you view the economy as a highly circular network of cash flows, then different taxation policies are basically inserting different amounts of drag or siphoning into different parts of the system. Then when that same money gets spent by the government, it's being reinserted somewhere else in the same system. All rates are ""100%"" or ""0%"" in the long run, in that any dollar inserted into the network will eventually be taken as tax, and then eventually disgorged back into the non-government economy (assuming connected components/etc.). So it seems some other way of analyzing the effects is needed.",1277530782

1463150,comment,1463044,1463044,0,0,_delirium,,,"This seems to be fairly arbitrarily double-counting all sorts of things. Taxes are levied at pretty much any transaction, so of course if you bundle multiple transactions, you get higher supposed rates. You could take it as high as you want with this accounting approach. Say you invest your money in a company, which earns profit, and pays corporate income taxes, then it reinvests that money for 10 years in a row, earns a profit each year, on which it pays income tax each year, then pays it to you in dividends. Then you reinvest that money in another company, and repeat. Then after some time, you use that money to buy some equipment, paying sales tax on it, and use that equipment to earn money, paying taxes on that income, which you then use to buy cigarettes. Oh my, you've paid about 99% tax at this point! That's the nature of taxes levied on transactions: if you run money through arbitrarily many transactions, it gets taxed at a rate arbitrarily close to 100%.<p>Mostly though it just seems like a content-free anti-tax whine. Is this really HN material? Is HN now the libertarian anti-reddit, purveyor of embarrassingly superficial economic analysis with strong political content massaging the viewpoints of its audience?",1277528870

We talked extensively about the affects of meditation after reading an article on the over-use, abuse and misunderstanding of meditation in some Western mainstream practices.  The article covered a few obvious but damaging cases: depressed and marginal personalities attempting to meditate for hours during a first attempt.  What struck me when talking about it with my wife is that meditation is a skill; it's something you have to learn to do and something someone else should probably teach you so that you use it responsibly.",1277528703

Same with the VC money.<p>Whether the stimulus trickled down to the startup economy I don't know, but it's the bailout of the financial system and money printing that is keeping massive amounts of cash flows from drying up.",1277528651

It was horribly slow in launching every app and the keyboard was so slow it was unusable.<p>I had to restore it back to 3.1.3.<p>spicyj gave me the starting point here:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1453553<p>I ran into a few problems, here is how I got it to work:<p>1)  Download 3.1.3 firmware for iPhone 3G from http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/.<p>2)  You have to put your phone in the appropriate DFU mode for downgrades.  (Whatever DFU stands for).<p>Switch of your iPhone, connect the USB cable to your mac / PC and put it in DFU mode with following instructions - Click the Home + Power On button for 10 seconds exactly - Release the power button and continue to click on Home.  The display should never turn on, but your iTunes should recognize the phone and warn you about recovery mode.<p>3)  Option click the restore button and choose the 3.1.3 firmware you downloaded.  Let it perform the recovery.<p>4)  If it fails with an error 1015, click ok.  The firmware is restored, but you have to snap the phone out of the recovery mode now.<p>5)  Download iRecovery as explained in this link.<p>http://www.ihackintosh.com/2009/09/recover-iphone-3gs-from-apple-logo-or-recovery-mode-loop/<p>6)  As explained there, copy the libusb-0.1.4.dylib to /usr/local/lib and give it executable permissions.<p>7)  Run ./iRecovery -s from the extracted directory.<p>8)  Set autoboot to true inside the iRecovery console:<p>setenv auto-boot<p>saveenvs<p>fsboot<p>9)  I had to do fsboot thrice and nothing happened.  It should have rebooted by now.<p>I did a power down and restarted the iPhone, and it was back up on 3.1.3 firmware.<p>If you run into problems or your phone is stuck in the recovery icon mode (USB port meets iTunes icon), please check out iRecovery and read all the possibilities there (there is a reboot command which might work, I didn't try it).<p>The downside to this is since my last iPhone backup was with iOS4, I could not restore it, I had to setup my phone as new.  That is something I can live with.<p>Upside - the phone seems MUCH faster now ;).",1277528586

I've never seen that anywhere else in the system - ever. We're talking one of the most competitive advertising stations in the system, with many multi-billion dollar companies competing for the eyes of the senior military decision makers, and it's Palantir Tech that has everything from the floor to the ceiling completely covered, not Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman, etc. I refuse to believe that an engineer in a back room, one day, decided he was tired of hashing out java code and picked up the phone and rang WMATA and bought a quarter million in advertising. No, that was done by their sales and marketing staff.<p>Their last conference had ~700 attendees, fully 100 of the attendees were Palantir employees flown out from the home office to fill out the space and make a big presence felt. That's fully 50% of the staff at the time. Oh, and to helpfully answer questions I suppose, but very few were able to coherently answer questions beyond a superficial level. Me and some of my colleagues kept getting passed off to probably the same half dozen engineers over and over again -- sometimes humorously so (""didn't we just meet upstairs at the breakout and talked about something completely different?""). It also doesn't help when there's so many Palantir people hanging out in reception area that it's impossible to walk a straight line from one part of the conference to the next because of the clusters of track jacketed employees lounging about and giggling excitedly whenever a uniformed Army officer walks by.<p>And let's not forget the conference itself, two floors in the Ritz Carlton, with catered lunch of Filet Mignon and similar fare for 1000 people? With an open bar after the conference? (Thanks for the coffee cups guys! They're actually pretty nice!) That's not a DBA running that.<p>Some other colleagues of mine at a different site described a team of ""slick haired, googly dressed, sales guys"" (actual quote) descending on their facility to hawk their wares. The brass was impressed that ""even the sales guys knew the technical stuff"". Which of course happens when your sales guys have engineering degrees -- I'd actually like to see more of this in the future in general, so it's a trend I like.<p>Direct personal experience? For every decent engineer of theirs I find at a site, I find 2 or 3 that don't seem to do anything except hand out stock business cards with direction to go check out operation tradestop or whatever their online demo is called.<p>If that doesn't persuade you that they have invested large dollars in a sales and marketing apperatus, my own interactions have been through people with ""Business Development"" in their titles.<p>Yes my friend, just because they happened to have graduated from Stanford or CalTech or wherever with an Engineering degree does not prevent a person from being in sales and marketing.<p>Like most things that come from the company, there's actually a pretty interesting kernel at the core of a giant pile of BS. The fact that their sales staff actually <i>are</i> engineers by training is a great thing to see in a large company. I've been on the receiving end of too many pitches by clueless sales guys with marketing degrees, when what I needed in that hour I was able to allocate to hear the pitch, was some hard technical answers. Having guys who know their stuff getting out there and pound pavement is no doubt a big part of their rapid success. But let's not be mistaken, they <i>are</i> salesmen, and the company <i>does</i> spend large amounts of money on marketing, press releases, advertisements, etc.<p>They actually stand out as much for their product as they do for the fact that they're by far the most ""present"" company in their competitive space on billboards and marketing materials in the entire area.",1277528527

The fact that a cost is ""sunk"" shouldn't be confused with determining the value of an expenditure.<p>When you start throwing in ""value"" the whole concept gets confusing.<p>Sunk costs _only_ mean that the fact that money has been spent on something should not affect future decisions.

I'm not sure she's the best person to reference when trying to defend people who are trying to put up procedural roadblocks to publishing the HTML5 working draft.<p>Larry Masinter is also a veteran of web standards.

I will note that the W3C HTML working group was chartered with canvas present in the working draft it adopted from the WHATWG, and the only reason it is being split into a separate specification is because of more procedural objections from the very same parties who seem to be opposing any innovation that came from the WHATWG and browser vendors.",1266256580

If someone tells you that their family owns a piece of land, first of all, you have no proof that they are telling the truth. Even assuming they are telling the truth, if they have a large family of people who look similar, Googling for who owns the land will not necessarily give you the individual who told you their family owned the land. That's the problem. The victim Googled about the owner of a piece of land and decided based on the results of that search who assaulted him. Given that identification of attackers is rather imperfect to begin with, I would not trust the victim's identification in this case. Simply seeing that a given person owned the land on which he was attacked could have convinced him that that person was the attacker even if he wasn't. You could say that Facebook was like a line-up and the victim identified his attacker on Facebook, but this line-up would not have stood up in court if done as a real line-up. You can't bring one person into a line-up and tell the victim that the person owns the land on which they were assaulted. <i>Of course</i> they'll identify them as the attacker.",1266254804

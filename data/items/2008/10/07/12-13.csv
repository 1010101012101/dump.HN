325655,comment,324800,325015,0,0,chmike,,,"Interesting point. I'm currently working on it. My impression is that it takes as much effort to design and implement the business model than to design and implement the product (idea). Another conclusion I draw from this effort is that it requires different skills and competence. It would be unusual to be good (or preferably the best) in all domains, but I believe it is possible.<p>My rule of thumb, to be successful in each domain, is to explore zones left in the shade (disregarded) and find something new and profitable. This applies to the idea (solving a problem) as well as to the business model.<p>A good strategy to be creative is to identify the assumptions we make, check their validity and see what comes out when you change them. Combine this with the appropriate combination and exploitation of the fundamental forces in play (assuming one has taken the time to properly identify them), and you can come up with a revolutionary and disruptive business model. If you manage to be very objective, rational and exhaustive in the exploration and evaluation process, this can work. (I hope I can prove it soon :] )<p>I see the startup community as an ant colony, following main tracks as a flock and just explore a bit away from the main paths. If one wants to increase the chance to discover something really new and disruptive, one has to follow orthogonal paths which means calling back into question common assumptions and habits. Otherwise you'll be in competition with zillions other ants, most of them being much more efficient and competent than we are.",1223384055

325649,comment,325597,325632,0,0,robg,,,"I agree to an extent, but the problem is defining X before you send the email.<p>Let me put it this way: During the normal weekday, a 15 <i>minute</i> delay is probably sufficient. But coming home late on a Friday night, is 15 <i>hours</i> enough? Or, in some cases, 15 <i>days</i>?<p>So that's the question: how to define X ahead of time without knowing all conditions for which X applies? I suppose you could have date/time conditionals, but there would be instances where you probably violate your own rules.",1223382884

If it's a high-density job like ""Marine rifleman,"" it'll probably be something other than your basic job description.  For variable density jobs, which could be anything from ""rank and file code monkey"" to ""RMS,"" it's a true conundrum.<p>For the record, I'm still not sure of the answer, nor what I want to do when I grow up, although I'm enjoying network security.",1223381527

325641,comment,325598,325598,0,0,wim,,,"Couldn't agree more.<p>You really need less than you might think. The whole point of traveling is that you see something new. You're never going to know exactly what you'll run into or do. Trying to prepare for everything is impossible :). Living with limited resources is interesting in itself, and can even get you into cool experiences meeting new people you have to ask for help.<p>And as for the software, this is actually an interesting analogy. I don't think I pack my backpack much differently from how I try to decide what goes into a program. Whether it's bloated software or a heavy bag, I use 20% of its contents 80% of the time anyway. I could probably do without the rest and find some interesting alternatives along the way.<p>I guess it takes traveling frequently to find out you should cut on features :)",1223381262

We are doing decent amount of work for various clients across globe. We work mainly on .NET and PHP platforms and we have team of around 40 to 50 developers.<p>Even though we are doing some cool work (check some of our work on our website) I feel quality of development is still not good enough. We have a good team but probably we are not able to get the best output.<p>I am following the practices mentioned in the book ""Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of great management"" and I am really satisfied with the output I am getting from my project managers. Now it is the developers who need my attention.<p>How can I make them great developers from just good developers? I know it is in genes but I also believe that we can also train them to greatness.<p>any ideas? suggestions?",1223381113

Reality does not conform to theory, there is always <i>some</i> gap between productivity and wages.  Oh hell, it's been a <i>growing</i> gap, for the past 40 years.<p><i>By eliminating jobs through manipulating the minimum wage so thoughtlessly, you would destroy vital segments of the job market that serve a purpose.</i><p>No, I ensure that jobs go to people who actually need them.  Besides, teenagers earning spending money can shovel snow off the books, or any number of other small jobs that they already do without recourse to an official employment contract.",1362614399

But the issue of defining ""completeness"" has been created a lot of frictions. While considering the development approach for our new spin off game studio, we came across LEAN approach and we are really proud of how much we could put in there within 5 weeks and we feel like most of that effort has been put as in ""working code"".<p>LEAN approach not only helped us with the amount of visibility on the product we are working on, but also re-shaped the way we think about ""completeness"" of a feature. Result of the experiment: happier team, more code in production, 2 or 3 builds a day.<p>Strongly suggested for small teams, who have less to waste.

Any economic outcome produced by a government action is incorrect; any economic outcome produced by a 'free market' (and no, I can't point to a completely free market, it's a spectrum) is right.  Thus, all positive aspects of actually-existing economies are thanks to the free market, and all negative aspects I can blame on the government.""<p>It's a completely typical example of utopian-totalitarian argumentation.  We always apparently need one less marginal unit of government action, no matter how much we actually have at the moment, at least until real life looks like a Neal Stephenson novel.<p>For a last point, if we really want to evaluate laissez-faire versus social democracy without resorting to moralization, we can.  We simply have to agree on what desirable versus undesirable outcomes look like <i>ahead of time</i>, and then look at the various natural experiments (or even near-controlled experiments, as when Canada or Australia do one thing and the USA does another).

Most of us who have looked at the illustrations side-by-side see their claim of owning copyright to be unfounded, for lots of reasons:<p>1) None of the illustrations in Flat UI are identical to LayerVault's illustrations. Derived works? Maybe. But under the law, that's okay.<p>2) Looking at illustrations from the Noun Project, and color palettes from Google and elsewhere, we see the same similarities that we do between LayerVault and Flat UI. If Flat UI is guilty of copyright infringement as LayerVault asserts, then LayerVault is most certainly guilty of copyright infringement from elsewhere.<p>3) Copyright isn't even the right legal vehicle for this debate. LayerVault could conceivably deem its icons to be trademarks, and show a likelihood of confusion when compared to Flat UI's icons. But LV using an icon set as a trademark would be unprecedented, and difficult to argue. (And even if that were the case, the Noun Project could just as easily claim LV infringed on their trademark.)<p>Overall, if LayerVault is claiming they own the copyright to illustrations used in Flat UI, they're flat-out wrong.

It's not meant to be self-promoting, but I feel that the experience is relevant.</i><p>There are a lot of ways to make actual profit (not just break even) with free applications.<p>The Hacker News crowd doesn't always show a lot of love for the ""small, free application"" crowd, and the echo chamber is correct that having a webapp doesn't mean you're a startup.<p>I know that I don't consider myself the ""founder"" of my app, because my site is not a company. I'm not trying to make it a business.<p>That said, though, this write-up glosses over what has been, in my experience, the easiest and most straightforward way to profit from free traffic: <i>non-</i>targeted ads. For me, that means a single banner advertisement served over Google Adsense.<p>Now, like I said, I'm not trying to make <a href=""http://sleepyti.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sleepyti.me</a> my primary income. If I wanted to charge users, or enter deals with, say, large mattress vendors, that would be different. But that isn't to say that the traffic and feedback I've received hasn't helped me both personally and professionally.<p>Personally, I've received a lot of attention from my app. It's pretty popular with college students, and it's gained media attention from outlets such as Lifehacker, the Toronto Star, and most recently the New York Times.<p>I'm not listing these sources to self-promote, but to show that from a personal exposure standpoint, it's opened many doors for me.<p>The same goes professionally: I had a brief partnership with YC-backed WakeMate, which, although now defunct, allowed me to interact with an early-stage YC company that I otherwise would not have been able to experience. I get between 1.6 and 2 million hits a month, and the financial reward has been steadily increasing through my single banner ad as well.<p>People always say that ""if you're not paying for it, you're the product,"" but I don't think that that's always true. I don't prey on my users, and I can think of several free apps that operate in a similar--even <i>less</i> obtrusive--manner. Trello, for example, neither serves ads nor sells my personal data (I hope!). Sometimes it's worth it for a developer to create something and truly release it for free, without having the immediate motive of profit.<p>I always tell college students who ask how to break into an industry--whether it's information security, professional programming, the startup world, or anything else--to <i>do</i> something. Sometimes a free application, such as the one I created as a free weekend side-project, turns into more than what it is. I'm more than aware that my experience is mostly a fluke, though. The take-home message should be that <i>even if it doesn't</i> become some massively-profitable, highly-trafficked app or site, it's still something that you built.<p>And that has value.",1362612734

He did, however, touch on what the important part of the pragmatic vs dogmatic question. This jumped out at me:<p>> In general I don't write tests for any code that I have to ""fiddle"" into place by trial and error.<p>It is congruent with a some general rules I follow to decide if I should write a test for something:<p>1) Do I care if this code doesn't work on the non happy-path? Maybe I'm writing some isolated prototype code that will probably be thrown away, or perhaps I'm planning to rewrite it later. I'm not going to bother writing tests.<p>2) How important is it that this code is bug free, and how soon should there's a bug. If, say, the code is in a highly used part of the program that is required by the rest of the app to function properly. Or it is part of the main feature set. I definitely will write tests.<p>3) I'm under time constraints. If I don't have the time to write tests for a particular part of the code, then I don't have time.<p>4) How solid is the architecture/interfaces? If I expect them to change quite a bit, then I will not write so many tests, or perhaps any. I once worked on a project that was heavy into unit testing/tdd. There was hundreds of tests written very early on in the project, and since the code was changing so much, we spent a lot of time re-writing tests. It eventually got to be a huge time sink.<p>5) How much money does the project have? Writing lots of tests takes time, and time is money. I've worked on some projects that have budge (or time) constraints, so I don't have the luxury of such dogma.<p>All that said, I often dislike programming religions or dogma, because they often advocate following a practice somewhat blindly, without understanding when the rules/precepts should be applied.",1362611494

More so given that running the routine through part of an actual launch, on an Ariane 4 at least, had never been problematic before.<p>The problem was that nobody had formally detailed all of the assumptions and risks for every part of the code, so when the conditions changed and those assumptions became faulty nobody was the wiser because nobody was aware they were actually making such an assumption about the speed of the rocket.",1362611129

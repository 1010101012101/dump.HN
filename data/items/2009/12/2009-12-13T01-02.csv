992242,comment,992170,992234,0,0,viraptor,,,"Well - this comment is quite interesting. The parent one looks like a one-line ""meh"" comment. I'm quite happy to downvote the original and upvote this one...<p>But is it really killing python? The language is basically the same (almost-dictionary based, easily extensible types / prototypes, etc.). There's a big difference though: afaik there's no real library for ecmascript that would integrate it with the os. There's simply no way to use ecmascript standalone on a typical system. ecmascript is good in places where you need an embedded scripting language, but lua is not enough. Unfortunately neither of them is useful as a general-purpose language right now. Once someone produces a serious repl-like environment and a set of sys / os / file libraries - it can compete with python.",1260669487

Shown on page 4 as part of the 'Advertising Control' components is 'Buy Ad Free Version'.<p>My guess is that this would be tied into a reduced cost iPhone.

992239,comment,992170,992215,0,0,megaduck,,,"Disclaimer:  I'm still a total lisp newbie, take all of this with a grain of salt.<p>As I see it, the biggest hurdle to learning LISP isn't the syntax per se.  Lisp's syntax is so simple, it's easily learned in a matter of minutes.  The whole language basically boils down to lists and dotted pairs, and lists can be boiled down to dotted pairs if you squint at them the right way.<p>The real obstacle for newcomers is that you have to completely rewire your brain.  The vast majority of us were taught programming with BASIC, C, Java, or something similar.  With those languages, programming is like following a recipe.  Do step a, then do step b, etc.  Moreover, imperative languages use a familiar ""verb"" and ""noun"" paradigm.  That's natural and intuitive to most of us.<p>With lisp, everything gets turned on its head.  Everything happens at once.  Code is data.  There's no syntactic sugar because there's no syntax.  You have to completely relearn how to look at computers and programming, and start over as a child.  It's incredibly rewarding once you start having those ""aha!"" moments, but there is a decent-sized conceptual hurdle for people that are used to procedural programming languages.<p>It seems that the majority of the lisp community suffers from the curse of knowledge.  For experienced lisp people, lisp is so natural and intuitive that it's hard to understand why other people have such trouble with it.  The OP is correct, lisp could really use more resources to bridge the gap between lispers and the outside world.",1260669307

992234,comment,992170,992205,0,0,alecco,,,"Hello, (former) fellow python fans. ECMAScript, formerly known as JavaScript, is doing very well. So well Python developers started to show their concern for about 2 years. You could read it on PyPy blog and Python mailing lists.<p>The new ECMAScript VMs are getting faster and already beating Python's. And they are getting faster with plenty of room to improve. The language is cleaning up, with a major milestone reached a few days ago. They have the biggest installed base in the world and there are more developers. The language fits in precisely the same slot as Python.<p>The writing <i>is</i> on the wall.

992224,comment,992170,992215,0,0,PieSquared,,,"The reason this syntax scares you is simple: it's different.<p>At the very root, Python syntax is nearly identical to Java, C, etc.<p>The syntax of Haskell, OCaml, etc, is a deviation from that of Python, Java, etc, but not an incredibly significant one. Perhaps you may find that the syntax of these languages scares you but you think you could probably learn it after a bit of mind-wrangling.<p>Lisp, on the other hand, is old. It was developed over 10 years before even C came to being! So the syntax is completely different, and requires you to actually learn it instead of just assuming that your knowledge of other programming languages will pull you through.<p>In summary, it's not a fault in you. It's just that you are used to C-derived and influenced syntaxes, but not to Lisp; and the syntax of Lisp is different enough that you need to actually <i>learn</i> it.<p>Here's a crash course:<p><pre><code>  (f a b c) is the same as f(a,b,c).
  '(a b c) is kind of like [""a"", ""b"", ""c""].
  '(1 2 3) is just like [1,2,3]
  (defun x (a b c ...) ...) defines a function x(a,b,c).
  (+ 1 2 3) is just like +(1,2,3) = 1 + 2 + 3
  (setf x 5) is just like x = 5
  '(a b ,c) is just like [""a"", ""b"", c]
  if L is equal to '(1 2 3), then
    `(10 20 ,@L) is like [10, 20, 1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
Now, to be honest, I just showed you nearly 100% of the 'syntax' Lisp has. The rest is already understanding the language  (knowing how to def. functions, how to do loops, etc).<p>By the way, what you might find interesting is that I once showed this to a friend of mine who knew nothing about programming. I showed him how to write a basic program in Java (with a few subroutines and a loop), then how to do it in Lisp. He exclaimed, ""Argh! If I can do it like this, then why do I need all those fancy weird words like public and void and what not and braces and... eugh!""<p>Sorry for that longish post, I hope you found it at least a bit informative. ;)",1260667654

Spoiler alert.<p>We have many customers using AppScale in production.  Some migrated away from GAE for very specific reasons.  Privacy (particularly in Europe), lock-in, control, performance and cost are the typical reasons...in that order.  Many, however, come to AppScale because they love the GAE development model and want the independence to run their application wherever is best for their business; without the restrictions, quotas and performance irregularities.<p>The brilliance of GAE is the development model.  The notion of concentrating on the business logic, the problem you are trying to solve, rather than working with stacks of software is the innovation.  Our customers, and GAE&#x27;s, are typically not tech companies.  They do not have a deep bench of experienced developers.  They are fashion and electronics retailers, global non-profits, SaaS companies trying to rapidly prototype and create MVP&#x27;s.  They want to innovate quickly and fail fast as they develop their business model.  This is where the GAE model shines.  It&#x27;s fast.  Business today must move at the speed of need, and the App Engine model, whether GAE or AppScale, is a tool that facilitates this.<p>AppScale is a complement to GAE.  If want to run in AWS, SoftLayer, Azure or Digital Ocean, no problem.  You can also run your app behind the firewall on OpenStack, Eucalyptus, CloudStack, Mothership1 or simply on top of KVM or VMware.  AppScale is easy to install and deploy from GitHub.  GAE needs to worry about running 4.5M active applications (up from 3M last year) but AppScale only needs to worry about one application, yours.<p>We understand that GAE did not make many fans in the early days.  That has changed and their 50% growth in active apps over last year is evidence.  Add AppScale to the picture and you get to continue using the awesome development model but you have the complete flexibility to run where you choose and maintain complete granular control over your app.<p>So, I will make a bold offer.  Check out AppScale and give it a test drive.  I would love to hear your feedback.  If you need some extra love, our engineers will help over our IRC channel at freenode, #appscale<p>It is our goal to be the open source private PaaS of choice for forward-thinking developers and companies.

You are applying a British mentality - that the area code defines an area.  In the US it is the exchange numbers (next 3 digits after the area code).  It used to be normal to not dial area codes.  I got bitten by this exact issue the first time I made a &quot;local&quot; call from a hotel, arguing with the front desk that a call to the same area code is by definition the same (local) area.<p>There are actually 3 distances - local, local toll, and long distance.  You can actually have a different carrier for each one!  For example local is a few miles around, local toll would be 20-100 miles away, and long distance after that.  (Americans like things complicated.)  When I had a land line it was about 5 times as much to call San Francisco (~60 miles away) than New York (~2,000 miles away)!<p>Local calls are included with your service price, also called &quot;free&quot; by people.  However the base service price was about four times what I paid in the UK.  There was a wonderful paper I saw years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find again, where they showed that Americans preferred fixed pricing - ie you know in advance what your bill will be - versus a pay as you go model.  Not only that they are willing to pay more for the certainty of those future bills.<p>The issue you are thinking of is that the termination rates in some rural areas are very high in order to subsidise providing the service there.  Consequently various &quot;free&quot; conference calls and similar services are sourced out of those areas.  The rural telco then shares the revenue.  The caller&#x27;s telco ends up paying for the increased rates - it isn&#x27;t visible to the caller.  This is why there is some weasel language in various phone contracts saying they won&#x27;t connect you to those numbers/services.<p>Call forwarding isn&#x27;t a perfect solution.  It still requires the cooperation of two companies - the one with the number, and the one where the number is forwarded to.<p>The argument isn&#x27;t defeated as such - rather the US had no option than to go the way it did.  Call prices are very cheap when adding together what the caller and recipient pay, compared to the rest of the world where some of it is hidden and regulators have stepped in setting rates rather than there being meaningful competition.<p>Telemarketers aren&#x27;t allowed to call cell phones.  Obviously that won&#x27;t just stop them, but since they are actually trying to sell something and they need to contact a reasonable volume of people to have success, it is a lot easier for them to be detected and blocked by the carriers.  I get about one telemarketer call a year.  I could also contact my carrier and they would remove charges for telemarketing calls.<p>The majority of cellular and landline plans now are unlimited voice calls in any direction, so most of the earlier issues aren&#x27;t present any more.",1406143943

As you add more people, you might need anything up to n*n lines of communication; in other words, you have possibly an exponential growth in meetings. So he discussed some things IBM had tried, and some possible ways to mitigate that growth in coordination events.<p>Bear in mind that Brooks was mostly talking about his work on OS/360 at IBM. OS/360 wasn&#x27;t a doghouse. IBM wasn&#x27;t a small organization. His interest in reducing meetings wasn&#x27;t caused by being anti-social, or having some antipathy toward management or PMs. It was caused by an interest in shipping products on time, which programmers are held accountable to do. (Consider that the next time you feel like accusing developers of being anti-social for wanting to get work done.)<p>Of course Brooks was discussing an idealized version of the problem, aimed at the essentials. But reality includes a lot of kinds of organizational bloat which really aren&#x27;t necessary to software production goals, they&#x27;re just hard to avoid in large organizations.<p>Say you are building a big house, and you can&#x27;t wait for one person to finish it by herself, so you have to hire and manage and pay n workers and keep the pipelines full; so you need funding up front; long story short, you make a construction company.<p>Everything you&#x27;re doing to scale up the organization encourages &quot;leaks.&quot;<p>With more funding, more self-interested contention over where it goes, more fighting over who got it for the company, etc.<p>With more hiring, more competition among hiring managers to build empires underneath themselves.<p>With more management structure, more regulation and enforcement to justify and expand the management structure.<p>With more decisions, more attempts to influence or take credit for those decisions, and endless arguments down to useless bikeshedding. (&#x27;what are the right approaches, methods ...&#x27;)<p>With more people, more internal social dynamics that become ends in themselves and change how the organization is steered and how resources are allocated in ways that often are actively harmful to the organization&#x27;s stated goals.<p>Now relative to these real-world phenomena, does it make sense for software-producing organizations to see their chief risk as letting the programmers who know about code write the requested code as they know best how to do? Or to solve that &quot;problem&quot; with micromanagement, creating more and more barriers and distractions (and morale drains, and reasons to leave) for programmers?",1406143312

(This following quotes are taken from the book  &quot;Energiya-Buran, the Soviet Space Shuttle&quot; by Bart Hendrickx and Bert Vis). \nAnd the actual reason is even more hillarious.<p>So, first, we now know the US space shuttle was the outcome of some bureaucratic processes in the US (NASA wants a new program to replace Apollo, the Air Force accidentally ends up in a super good negotiating position, Nixon does not want to be responsible for ending manned flight but also doesn&#x27;t want to pay for a trip to Mars), so in the end it didn&#x27;t end up a very sensible design. But the Soviets did _not_ known this, and assumed there must be some secret rational reason for building it:<p>> As TsNIIMash [Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building] director Yuriy Mozzhorin later said: &quot;[The Space Shuttle] was introduced as a national program, aimed at 60 launches per year ... All this was very unusual: the mass they had been putting into orbit with their expendable rockets hadn&#x27;t even reached 150 tons per year, and now they were planning to launch 1,770 tons per year. Nothing was being returned from space, and now they were planning to bring down 820 tons per year. This was not simple a program to develop some space system ... to lower transportation costs (they promised they would lower those costs tenfold, but the studies done at our institute showed that in actual fact there would be no cost savings at all). It clearly had a focused military goal&quot;.<p>So what might this secret military goal be? Apparently the Soviet speculations was that either it might be part of some nuclear fractional-orbit bombardment system, or it might be part of a plan to launch lots of laser weapons into orbit. In any case, we can&#x27;t have a space shuttle gap, so:<p>> &quot;[Central Committe Secretary for Defense Matters, Dmitri] Ustinov had made the following argument: if our scientists and engineers do not see and specific use of this technology now, we should not forget that the Americans are very pragmatic and very smart. Since they have invested a tremendous amount of money in such a project, they can obviously see some useful scenario which is still unseen from  Soviet eyes. The Soviet Union should therefore develop such a technology so that it won&#x27;t be taken by suprise in the future&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s build it now, and see what it is good for later!

Every single function has three, four or more ways to do the same thing, often with different results. When trying to get something working I never know if I should run the /etc/init.d script, restart the service manually, edit a config file, use the command line config until or use the GUI settings option. Sometimes you edit a config file and get the thing to work, only to find out some other utility will overwrite it next reboot. Other times you get strange errors or just nothing at all, because it&#x27;s a deprecated method and you should have used the brand new tool-du-jour instead. It&#x27;s a mess.",1406142068

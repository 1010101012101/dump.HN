Maybe coincidental, but I tend to hire freelance designers from Europe at hourly rates of $30-$70. While I did encounter mix results, all the design work was still considered very high quality.<p>For 5 basic concepts, it ran me around 7 hours, after which adding another 5 hours for coloring, textures, shadow, typography comes out to be around $500-$700.

3024303,comment,3022023,3023407,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Actually, if you restrict yourself to a hypothetical ""need to build something Shuttle like using available technology"" universe then you can get something safer fairly easily. Buran, for example, was considerably safer for a few reasons, but we could make something even safer.<p>First, ditch the SRBs, they are a severe safety hazard (they led to one Shuttle disaster, for example) because they are segmented, they can't be throttled, they can't be turned off, etc. That leaves you with a thrust problem though, due to the low thrust of LOX/LH2 engines. So, second, replace LOX/LH2 with LOX/Kerosene. Now you have plenty of thrust, now you don't have to deal with super-cryogenic fluids, now you don't have to eke out every possible mass ratio boost on the ET because both LOX and Kerosene are fairly dense. Now you can ditch the foam insulation, and ice formation is slightly less of a problem.<p>Third, take the engines off the orbiter and put them on the booster (ET). Now you've created a vehicle, like Energia, which you can launch non-Orbiter cargo with. Realistically you haven't made things more expensive by throwing away expensive high performance engines every trip because it takes so long to inspect, refurbish, and re-install the SSMEs on the orbiter anyway that it's a wash money-wise, and probably for the best time-wise. On the plus side now the orbiter doesn't have to support the thrust of giant engines so its frame can be made lighter. Also, it doesn't have to bring those engines back down to Earth, so it can be yet lighter again.<p>Fourth, snip the wings off the orbiter. Turns out the military didn't really need a several hundred mile cross-range landing flight capability on the orbiter because the super-hypothetical mission that was designed for never turned out to be even remotely practical. So, smaller wings mean less mass and, again, a lighter frame. Now you've reduced the orbiter mass by a crap-ton and gotten rid of the huge amount of super vulnerable leading-edges on the wings. Now you can use a less sophisticated thermal shielding system on the orbiter (since it's lighter, smaller, and barely has wings at all), you don't need the carbon-carbon composite wing leading-edge bits, you don't need the vulnerable ceramic tiles that need to be meticulously inspected after every flight.<p>Now you have a vehicle that is much simpler and safer and yet does essentially everything that the old Shuttle system actually did in practice.<p>Granted, if you were designing something from a clean sheet at this point you would never end up with anything even remotely resembling the Shuttle.",1316652226

I work in the medical research field, specifically in cardiac stem cells and stem cell therapies. The aim is to inject stem cells into the scarred/diseased portions of the heart with the hope that these stem cells will regenerate into or 'grow up to be' adult cardiac cells.  In short, from my own research and those of others, injected stem cells have only produced mechanical improvements, ie, the cardiac function (output or pumping action of the heart) improves by 5%.  Many see this as a 'measurable' benefit (despite double blind studies).  Personally, I see it as within the limits of statistical error.  The other problem (and no one has conclusively demonstrated) is that there is no electrical activity coming from or being generated from these engrafted cells.  So, to make a long story short, stem cells in the realm of the heart and as a therapy has hit a brick wall.  In culture, stem cells have been shown to differentiate into their intended adult cells.  But in reality, and with so many other variables, the injected stem cells may act entirely different once they are injected into the heart.  Many startups in this area will try to spin it and say 'we are very close, we just have to tweak it'.  But in my opinion, 'injected cardiac stem cells' and 'regeneration' just don't go in the same sentence anymore...",1316650764

He doesn't have a real passion for the game as he states in one of his videos. For that reason I don't think he will, or <i>can</i> become elite (on Tour) but I don't doubt that he can still get to expert level after a few more years of dedicated practice.<p>I think that passion part is key to becoming truly great. The passion drives the desire to practice, and practice <i>well</i> with large gains. During his time Hogan was known for practicing more than any other golfer, when he began to do really well on tour the other golfers started joining him so they could keep up. When asked how he was able to work so hard and practice so much he replied that he hard a hard time getting to sleep because he couldn't wait to get to the range in the morning to practice. Hogan was and still is known as the greatest ball striker ever.<p>Again, I believe that Talent = Passion + Time Spent. A component of passion is dedication and perseverance which he seems to have but there's something else that really drives it. Without it I think he's limited to what he can achieve.<p>Perhaps it's idealistic but I don't think anyone who lacks passion can hit like Hogan no matter how much time they spend. I'm sure they can become very good, but not like Hogan.<p>For the uninitiated, art: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Nw__K1myQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Nw__K1myQ</a>",1316650369

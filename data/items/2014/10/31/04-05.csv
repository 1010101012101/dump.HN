I think the problem is that when you say things like &quot;these things don&#x27;t work&quot; you&#x27;re glossing over the key to why they don&#x27;t work: people aren&#x27;t organized. That&#x27;s it. It may not be glamorous or fun like tossing over the pigmobile but it&#x27;s proven to work every single time throughout history.<p>Let&#x27;s look at boycotts. The problem with boycotts isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re not effective; they can be. My family participated in a successful one against Iceland&#x27;s whaling policies in the 80s and even though I was young, I never forgot why we did it and that it was right. So what&#x27;s the problem? They ignore institutional structures that persist despite our actions. If one particular corporation strays too far, boycott pressure is effective. Don&#x27;t forget how it played into bringing down South African apartheid.<p>My point here is that we don&#x27;t need to go looking for new solutions. Good old fashioned organizing works. It <i>does</i> combat LG&#x27;s bought politicians--remember my friend, we still have democratic institutions and we can vote anyone we want into office. People don&#x27;t like to be reminded of what really works, I think. We need socialism. We need to vote them into office and make good privacy laws. That&#x27;s that. No need to reinvent the wheel. Then we can talk about an informal technocracy democratically dissolving the state into libertarian socialist anarcho-communism.",1414730894

KVO is a clunky API that&#x27;s very inconsistently available and easy to misuse. Interfaces built using auto layout in xibs are very tricky to debug and maintain. There&#x27;s all kinds of string typing in the APIs which defeats many of the benefits of static typing.

I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a corruption of morality in reserving &quot;marriage&quot; to heterosexual couples. A substantial part of that position comes from my view on marriage in general - its origins, its contractual formula, its roots in the church, even the cost of marriage and the industry around marriage...

In my thinking about it, I thought that it would be massively useful to record both the exact time and order pages were visited in, and the other tabs open at that time. Lastly, check out AlchemyAPI to auto-suggest some tags / keywords based on page content to make recall easier.<p>Basically this + all of the above + a browsable timeline interface was my idea. Please take it and build it if you have the time / motivation, and I&#x27;ll subscribe to your service (or help hack on it if you open-source it). The best competitor I&#x27;ve found so far is Pocket with the premium features (I&#x27;m a subscriber).<p>Good luck, and great work. I also love meteor and ES :)",1414728744

One idea:  Maybe have an option to &quot;backfill&quot; based on your browser&#x27;s history?  Seems like a good way to give users instant gratification, and solves the problem of &quot;I wish I&#x27;d started running this a year ago&quot;.  In reality, I wish I had it for every page I&#x27;ve visited in the last 14 years.<p>Update: Another idea - maybe you could integrate with pinboard or delicious.com (if anyone still uses it) to backfill-index all links saved to those services.  Maybe this could be a premium feature.",1414728719

That sounds nice in theory but how many complete languages have been fully implemented on top of vanilla LLVM and which version does it need? I see many experimental frontends that may one day be complete but by then LLVM will be at a new version and will likely be using a different bytecode.<p>I like the idea of having a language specifically for compiling to but either way someone has to build the prototype implementation.

So imaging you are receiving a request, most of the time due to Network latency (client or server side), you don&#x27;t get the full Request at once, most of the time you need to perform a couple of read(2) operations.<p>Now, what do you do on each read ?, did you manage full state ?, how many parsing rounds ?, how to catch the end of the protocol block , etc etc etc.<p>So answering your questions I would say &quot;YES&quot;, the HTTP protocol in a Server &quot;may be&quot; a bottleneck if its not well implemented. In our HTTP Server project[0] we are working in a new parser to improve performance, so for real, this is a very important topic.<p>[0] <a href=""http://monkey-project.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkey-project.com</a><p>best",1414728264

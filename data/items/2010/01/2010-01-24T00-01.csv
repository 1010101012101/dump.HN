One of my college professors, Rajit Manohar, was one of the guys who did a lot of the major research into async VLSI in the 90s.  He and a few of his colleagues founded a company in San Jose (Achronix) that designs and builds async FPGAs.<p>It's an amazingly different way of thinking about computing.  Generally async designs take up more physical die space (because of things like dual-rail logic), but the power savings can be pretty significant since you're not running a clock... basically the logic runs as fast or as slow as it needs to, and doesn't do much of anything when idle.<p>I took a class where we designed and did a little layout for some CPU-subset blocks.  It was fun, but often very challenging.  At least at the time, there weren't many (any?) good test/validation tools.  A friend of mine has been working on one for the past 8 years or so (<a href=""http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~fang/hackt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~fang/hackt/</a>), first as a part of his PhD thesis, later as a part of his job.<p>It's been years since I've touched this stuff... if I'd continued down the EE path (like many others, I switched to software post-college) I'd (ideally) be doing async stuff now.",1264294382

Twice were before this year, and it takes some quick work, but both times it was no real challenge to stabilize my machine, so beyond feeling really stupid for a few hours, it ended up being kind of fun.<p>In November, though, I infected my machine again.  Three days later, it was still phoning home to Russia and the Ukraine.  There was literally nothing I could do - even Malwarebytes and the like would clean it up only to a certain extent, and the viruses were still embedded in the system software.  Finally I just gave up and bought a new machine so I could start from scratch, only pulling data from the old machine.<p>A good AV won't let you get infected - you still shouldn't allow actions that look fishy or unexpected, but at least you're in control.  But once you're infected, the botnet can respond in realtime to what you're trying to do to stop it.  And they're better than you are at it.<p>I'm not saying it's impossible to clean up a machine that's fallen into their hands - but I am saying that even with some past success in this under my belt, I was unable to do it in any amount of time that was justified (even in terms of fun).",1264293567

Yeah, welcome to cell-phone service in the US.  (I'm shocked we even have GSM providers here at all.)<p>Personally, I think this problem falls completely outside the scope of Google.  He wants people calling a non-Google Voice number to get to his Google Voice voicemail.  This is a feature that has to be provided by the network, because it needs to work when your phone is off.  T-Mobile does not provide this feature unless you pay them money.  He doesn't want to pay them money, so he doesn't get the feature.<p>It's an annoying arbitrary limitation (because T-Mobile's network supports this just fine; call my ""real"" T-Mobile number and you get my Google Voice voicemail), but it's not Google's fault.  It's just how cell phone service works in the US; it's based around subsidized devices or really cheap featureless devices.  Nobody has a featureful unsubsidized smartphone, so it's not a case that the providers handle.  They disable features on the cheap subsidized phones because they want to upsell you to a subsidized phone, guaranteeing revenue for 2 years.<p>Anyway, if the author is setting up a new number for this phone, he can avoid the whole problem by only telling the new number to Google.  Everyone else can call his Google Voice number directly, and then it doesn't matter where his real voicemail forwards to.  (I stopped telling everyone my real number about 6 months ago, and now it gets no calls.)<p>Sadly, short of moving to another country, I don't think there's any way the author can get what he wants.  (AT&T doesn't even allow the possibility of data use unless you have a multi-year contract.)<p>Edit: Since the author makes the inevitable iPhone comparison, it's worth pointing out that ""Buying an unlocked iPhone is an impossible experience.""",1264293353

Then, a simple list of rules doesn&#x27;t suffice, and some kind of programming is needed.<p>To solve such problems elegantly I designed my &quot;NCD programming language&quot; (link: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/wiki/NCD</a> ). The language has built-in backtracking, so in the case of iptables, the language itself makes sure any iptables rule that was added is also removed when that is necessary, in a manner not unlike exception handling in C++ etc. Link to iptables module: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/trunk/ncd/modules/net_iptables.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/trunk/ncd/mod...</a>",1378148344

The thing is, JavaScript is just plain fun to write in, and the responsiveness and full-stack capabilities are amazing.<p>I think we just have to accept that JavaScript is here to stay.

It seems like a long time for people used to computer technology, but it&#x27;s a typical generational cycle for industrial technology.<p>The 787, for example, which is just trickling into fleets now, was in development since the late 1990&#x27;s (15 years ago). Power technology has developed even more slowly. E.g. the efficiency of coal power plants has only improved by about a factor of two in the last century or so.

On the other hand, Nintendo could make an absolute killing by selling a gamepad accessory for the iPhone - extra battery life plus a decent d-pad/thumbsticks would be an easy sell for gamers.  You could probably even price it at a pretty steep mark-up and make nearly as much profit as they must be making on the DS.  Make all Nintendo games compatible with it, and run a licensing scheme so that other game companies can list themselves as compatible with the hardware.<p>This strategy allows Nintendo to continue innovating where they have successfully done so in the past - specifically with clever input devices.  It&#x27;s been a long time since Nintendo could claim to rule the roost for things like raw processing power, so leave Apple to do the heavy lifting there.",1378148115

I cannot say that about any other build tool.<p>I do think having the templating portion of the web stack being in a client side language is important, as there&#x27;s typically lots of overlap and interoperability that can happen at that layer between the client and server.

A developer costs a company hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in salary and benefits, and even a good workstation setup is probably much less than $5000 every couple of years.",1378147890

A day rate of 150 per day to the customer sounds very low; it&#x27;s hard to find contract rates that low on the likes of Monster across the UK and typical to see 250-500, so double that for the company hiring out. I&#x27;ve seen rate cards for agencies in advertising charging out developers on projects from 500 to over 1,000 depending on what exactly is being worked on. If 150 a day is too much and costing work anything lower seems unsustainable to run anything more than a lifestyle business for a few select people at the top.<p>If it&#x27;s 7pm and the developers are likely to be still there for a while - is that &quot;the norm&quot;? Then you are in effect taking a pay cut already on what sounds like below market rate wages. This sort of practice is toxic. It&#x27;s ok to work late but when it&#x27;s expected as part of the job but not without any compensation (can be extra time off, not just money) then this really annoys the hell out of me. Someone higher up is making money out of this. That might be the status quo but I would really consider working on the C.V. and widening out skills and look elsewhere - there&#x27;s no harm in it.<p>The guys behind you paid less than median (21.3k in 2012 according to Wikipedia) and that have been at it for 3 years - from that I get the impression they were fresh out of university and this was the first job? And the highest paid guy at just 10% more, so around 23k, is there no CTO or senior developer? To me it sounds like someone&#x27;s taking advantage of young, enthusiastic energy here. More so with the &quot;we will be here a while&quot; comment - you should work out what your effective annual salary is based on that; otherwise you can just let it slide and fall into acceptance. If your contact states 9 - 6 the company needs to appreciate the above and beyond work. That&#x27;s what it is, no matter what others might tell you.<p>We recently hired for a mid-level developer role at our office in Hoxton and that was around the 40k mark which seems to be around right. As the tech director there I regularly get unsolicited CVs via recruiters and salary ranges requested typically range from the 30k mark up to around 60k.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to come off as in anyway &#x27;know it all&#x27;y or &#x27;just do x&#x27; - I&#x27;m genuinely interested in the situation as a fellow UK based dev. Your situation contrasts starkly with my developer friends (based in London, Belfast, Hertfordshire & Leeds) so I&#x27;d like to hear more if possible. I often extol the virtue of learning developer skills to younger folk who I interact with and have always painted it as a pretty good way to get a good head-start financially over many other occupations.<p>When I started out at just above the median I was so thrilled that I was actually getting paid to do what I started out doing in my bedroom as a young kid. After passing the 30 mark I&#x27;ve come to realize it&#x27;s about what value you can provide to the company, there&#x27;s no shame in wanting to be out at 6, for one thing realistic timing plans that actually reflect reality are far more useful than ones papered over with hours upon hours of hidden overtime - I&#x27;m not saying that hard, late nights are out of the question - I just don&#x27;t expect it to be treated as the norm&#x27; or assumed unless it&#x27;s also reflected in compensation of _some sort_ (we&#x27;ve in the past traded late nights for conference & flight fees for instance). There&#x27;s also no shame in taking a look what else is out there and moving if you have to - there is some give and take on your part in progressing. Moving jobs is usually the easiest way to significantly bump your pay grade. It&#x27;s hard work but can really be worth it in the long run.",1378147890

Without testing a hypothesis, and without a careful examination of a mechanism, the correlation has precisely no meaning apart from chance.<p>Here&#x27;s an example selected at random from a vast literature that tries to make this point:<p><a href=""http://boingboing.net/2010/12/20/creating-a-phony-hea.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2010/12/20/creating-a-phony-hea.html</a><p>Title: &quot;Creating a phony health scare with the power of statistical correlation&quot;<p>Quote: &quot;In the United Kingdom, the more mobile phone towers a county has, the more babies are born there every year.

This is why all self-respecting scientific papers include a p-value.

(AES-256 is fine, though.) They licensed patents for particular implementation techniques:

There&#x27;s quite a lot of RSA-1024 out there, so that would be a fruitful project. So, maybe.&quot;<p>(There&#x27;s a lot of RSA-1024 out there partly because old 1024-bit SSL certs die hard, and people are lazy about switching to bigger keys if, for example, it would make establishing SSL sessions more expensive.)<p>Finally, perhaps not related to public-key crypto but really interesting, the XKeyScore deck had the bullet point &quot;Show me all the VPN startups in country X, and give me the data so I can decrypt and discover the users&quot; as one of the things you can tell the system to do. That could just refer to one of those protocols that everyone knows is broken but is still in use (MS-CHAP/PPTP) or to either a protocol/implementation break or something else affecting VPNs we currently think are secure.<p>Maybe the best argument <i>against</i> a crypto breakthrough is that it&#x27;s clearly extremely hard (none of the brilliant mathematicians working in the open are close) whereas attacks on implementations and protocols are relatively easy. If you have a big bag of 0-days, have stolen some certificates (as Stuxnet seemed to indicate), and are inside a bunch of service providers, it seems almost redundant to put a lot of effort into factoring big numbers, unless some big technical improvement basically falls in your lap.",1378147759

(Without familiarity, it&#x27;s easy to assume that flawed grammar and pronunciation means either flawed thinking or risky cultural differences.) So I&#x27;d surmise that the heavily-accented currently have their <i>best</i> opportunities ever to thrive in North American capital/recruiting/selling markets  and earlier generations of investors would have offered even harsher assessments about the impact of strong accents.<p>One of the points I was making with the <i>My Fair Lady</i>-themed joke in another thread (the SayAfter.me accent training offer) was that this is an eternal issue.<p><i>Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters; condemned by every syllable she utters</i><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhninL_G3Fg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhninL_G3Fg</a><p>That film came out in 1964 (winning Best Picture), based on a 1956 stage musical, based on a 1913 play (<i>Pygmalion</i>).

A non-native accent is more likely to indicate someone with the education and drive to dare operating in a non-native language environment. But, it takes a bit of familiarity to internalize that understanding, and stronger accents still signal a risk of slower and more error-prone communication.<p>When someone honestly points out that the strongest accents have been problematic, based on significant observational experience, they haven&#x27;t &quot;slipped&quot;, they&#x27;ve done the listeners a favor by sharing a perceived truth.

But, I missed running Adobe CS, and it wasn&#x27;t my machine. After ten years of using OSX I turned to Windows.<p>The Pro has tackled all the tasks, I&#x27;ve thrown at it so far. For example, I recently worked on a case study for a startup I work with. That meant writing, doing interviews, researching, and some graphic design. A good amount of work was done in Google Docs. But, the rest of my work flow lived in OneNote, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.<p>At one point I had Illustrator, Photoshop, Chrome, Metro IE, and Xbox Music running, without any hiccups. This was all while sitting at 1871, a collaborative workspace in Chicago. A laptop can handle this right? Yeah. But, the Surface is a tablet, that costs 799-899 dollars. Before, I purchased the Pro, I was looking at getting a Macbook Air or a Macbook Pro. The Macbook Pro was out of my price range, and the Air was a close competitor. I mention cost to make a point on the price to value ratio for this machine.<p>The Surface is the sum of its parts. It has a high DPI screen, headphone jack, a digitizer, a kickstand, a USB port, MircoSD card slot, and a mini DVI port. At home it sits alongside a monitor, acting like a desktop.<p>The Surface Pro, has quickly become one of my favorite pieces of technology, in a long time. The battery life could be better, and not every piece of software is optimized to work well on the screen. But, overall, its a dream to use on a daily basis.

Before, Steve Jobs, unveiled a 10 inch tablet that ran iOS not OSX.<p>PS.

The auto industry was notoriously monofilamental in its innovation, as its CEOs preferred it.  Their conservative operation proved a great long-term investment, with an eventual crumbling down hitting hard in the 1980s and hardly recovering.<p>Innovation represents hours sweated and is always rewarded.  So far the computer science industry has been well-motivated to continue innovation, as computation becomes one of the world&#x27;s standard utilities.  But once it&#x27;s all up and running _and_standardized, it will only take a smaller number of people to run it, like the power grid, water supply, phone system, etc.<p>It is all like plumbing, and like plumbers, there are household ones for household needs like web storefront/office/communications desks and industrial plumbers, but most of the unique, research-y plumbers are in a small, elite group who are innovating on their own and sharing their work with the public and are well-compensated.  I think that&#x27;s the effect we&#x27;ll see, a narrowing or thinning of the industry somewhat, but it definitely won&#x27;t settle until after use-cases are standardized and we&#x27;re still a zillion miles from that.<p>Imagine NASA doing a shuttle lunch with everyone from the control room at home in their backyards cooking BBQ with their family :)  Cell phone in one hand, spatula in the other.",1378146259

All the jobs were going out to India. However, I learned a very important lesson.  You have to be competitive.  If you were someone who couldn&#x27;t see past cobol, you did become obsolete.  While programmers in India are still relatively less expensive than their counterparts in the US, top programmers are still sought after and make significantly more than the rest.<p>Sure the barrier to entry is &quot;low&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t that low.  I think one of the main problem is, calling someone a programmer is an extremely &quot;broad&quot; term.  I know some who can barely string together a few lines of PHP code and other who design and build complex systems which run the world and improve people&#x27;s lives.  If you&#x27;re a programmer who just &quot;codes&quot; HTML, which you learned over one weekend and haven&#x27;t take the time to improve your craft, sure you may be working now, but you&#x27;re likely to get wiped out easily since the barrier to entry into your line of work would be very low.<p>In a sense the OP is right in that programmers shouldn&#x27;t be complacent.  I know a lot of C coders who have serious BS ego issues and refuse to do anything but C and then complain that they can&#x27;t find work after being laid off.<p>BUT, I&#x27;m not shivering in my boots due to Stripe and Wordpress.  Any programmer knows there&#x27;s a bunch of crap that&#x27;s tedious work which can be automated away.  The good ones automate them and improve their craft and focus their energies on building better systems.  I think that even with Wordpress, Stripe etc, there&#x27;s a lot of room form improvements in the way we develop.<p>I recall spending days getting a dialog box UI just right in MFC.  I thought it was stupid then and after using C#, never used MFC to build a dialog box ever again.  Result wasn&#x27;t that I&#x27;m out of a job.  I actually have been able to produce a lot more.  Programmers are in ever more demand than before.  Sure the field will probably get tapped at some point, but to say it&#x27;s going to be due to &quot;automation&quot; which  has been a staple in our profession since the very beginning is simply inane.<p>Going with the autoworkers analogy, there are people who turn wrenches and people who figure out six sigma.  If you&#x27;re doing something as simple as turning a wrench, sure, you will get easily replaced by robots.  But if you&#x27;re innovative and competitive, you&#x27;ll be significantly harder to replace and you can probably find applications for your skills in many more places.  There are certain skills you just can&#x27;t automate away so easily.<p>I would argue that programmers/developers will have jobs long past even doctors (maybe).  Repetitive tasks can easily be automated away, creativity and innovation on the other hand aren&#x27;t quite as easy.  (FYI, the reason all programming jobs aren&#x27;t just in India is because the US still rocks when it comes to creativity and innovation, based on my own experiences as an employer/manager and in speaking with others in the same position who have programming staff worldwide)",1378145793

This is not the case for what I&#x27;d call a strong accent.  Those strong accent are too far away from a locution I can make sense of.  A strong accent makes it hard to grasp the words that are said.  And if you&#x27;re in a venture perspective and nobody can make sense of the words that are getting out of your mouth, I believe it&#x27;s fair to say that your strong accent is a problem.<p>From my limited point of view, I have noticed that some speakers with strong accents seem to be oblivious to the fact that they are hard to understand.  They speak grammatically correct sentences and they sit on that knowledge seemingly thinking it&#x27;s enough, that it&#x27;s me who&#x27;s stupid for not understanding what they said.  The problem in those cases is that through their confidence, they try to speak too fast for their ability to clearly pronounce words and their syllables, which results in a long stream of garble to my ear.<p>English is my second language, French being my native tongue, and I do have an accent myself, but I try to speak individual words and syllables clearly.

6316312,comment,6315829,6316133,13,0,gjm11,,,"I wonder exactly what &quot;it&quot; is here.<p>Quantum mechanics with the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation explains lots of things: it explains all the same things as quantum mechanics with some other interpretation. But QM (many worlds) has all the same observable consequences as, say, QM (Copenhagen), so &quot;many worlds&quot; <i>as opposed to</i> Copenhagen doesn&#x27;t explain anything[1].<p>But how does that mean that intelligent people shouldn&#x27;t take the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation seriously?<p>Consider two &quot;interpretations&quot; of Newtonian mechanics. One says that the world mechanically obeys Newton&#x27;s laws. Another says that the world is controlled by incorporeal angels who are very fond of Newton&#x27;s laws and always freely choose to push the universe around in such a way that those laws are obeyed. These two interpretations have the same observable consequences (namely, a universe in which Newton&#x27;s laws always hold), but that doesn&#x27;t make it surprising if intelligent people take the &quot;mechanical&quot; version of it seriously.<p>Nor, actually, does it make it surprising if intelligent people take the &quot;angels&quot; version seriously. What (at least for me) makes that option hard to take seriously is its gratuitous complexity: it has the same observable consequences as the &quot;mechanical&quot; system but, at least in my view, is vastly more complicated -- if you wanted to describe such a universe completely you&#x27;d need to do all the same work as for the &quot;mechanical&quot; version and then go on to set down everything about the angels&#x27; nature, personalities, etc.<p>In much the same way, you might choose to prefer &quot;many worlds&quot; or Copenhagen or some other specific interpretation of QM on the grounds of simplicity. &quot;Many worlds is simplest because it avoids notions of &#x27;measurement&#x27; and &#x27;collapse&#x27; that do no real work, and just says that everything obeys Schroedinger&#x27;s equation all the time.&quot; Or: &quot;Many worlds is horribly complex because it involves all those extra worlds we never observe.&quot;<p>So if you mean: &quot;The many-worlds interpretation of QM explains nothing more than any other interpretation of QM does, and therefore it&#x27;s surprising that intelligent people take the many-worlds interpretation seriously&quot;, I think that&#x27;s wrong. But perhaps what you&#x27;re surprised that people take seriously is some other thing like, e.g., some particular application of the anthropic principle that appeals to &quot;many worlds&quot;?<p>[1] Actually, that&#x27;s maybe slightly debatable; it depends on fine details of what you understand by &quot;explain&quot;. For instance: any theorem in pure mathematics is logically necessary[2] and therefore has <i>no</i> observable consequences that you couldn&#x27;t derive without it -- but it still seems reasonable to say, e.g., that a proof that even-length palindromes have to be multiples of 11 &quot;explains&quot; why I&#x27;ve never seen a palindromic prime number with 4, 6, 8, ... digits. So the fact that QM (many worlds) has no extra observable consequences beyond &quot;uninterpreted&quot; QM might not be enough to guarantee that it doesn&#x27;t explain anything.<p>[2] Given whatever axioms you start with.",1378145256

So at the same speeds these should be able to brake faster than traditional trains.<p>I assume these have the potential of going significantly faster than normal trains making braking harder. In this test though they didn&#x27;t reach even the peak speed of normal trains. Apparently the french TGV has the record for normal trains at 575km/h[2] (vs 500km/h in this test) even though normal operation is &quot;only&quot; 320km/h.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#Power_and_energy_usage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#Power_and_energy_usage</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV</a>",1378144868

6316276,comment,6315664,6316073,18,0,evmar,,,"Historically, the web standards process was theorized to work like:<p>1) vendor introduces new feature, tagged with vendor name to not pollute the namespace (e.g. -webkit-foo, or msapplication-TileColor from the OP)<p>2) once feature becomes popular enough to warrant its permanence, vendors agree on some new standard name for the agreed-upon behavior<p>3) ???<p>4) everyone uses the new standard name<p>The problem with this idea is that step 3 is missing.  Browsers can&#x27;t drop their -webkit CSS support because old pages rely on it, and new pages still use -webkit to work on old browsers.  The original name is effectively permanent so there&#x27;s little incentive to even take step 2, because all that produces is two names for the same thing (e.g. you use an attribute with &quot;apple&quot; in the name to choose the Android icon).<p>In recognition of the failure of this process, Blink (and other browsers) is using a different approach, where new features are not namespaced; instead, they&#x27;ll require users to individually opt-in to nonstandard features, under the idea that it&#x27;s hard for an idea to become permanent if it requires each user to individually configure their browser:<p><a href=""http://www.chromium.org/blink#vendor-prefixes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/blink#vendor-prefixes</a><p>I am a little skeptical that this will only result in going too far the other way -- new features will wither because you can&#x27;t experiment with them enough to get enough mass behind them to standardize them -- but at least it&#x27;s not retreading the known broken path.",1378144807

749250,comment,749165,749165,0,0,mixmax,,,"A small note of caution.<p>I did a startup some time ago where we were four founders. One of them was an excellent enterprise sales guy. In his previous job he had managed sales in excess of $100 million on a yearly basis. His job was, of course, to push the product. It didn't work out because he was used to a big organization that took care of everything from planning his meetings to serving him coffee. He simply didn't get the startup culture where you have to save every penny you've got, and do everything yourself with noone to delegate to.<p>We ended up buying his shares and he went back to big-corp where he was more at home.<p>I'm not saying that all enterprise sales people are like this, just that it's something to be aware of.",1249735957

I'm curious, however if you've ever considered any kind of alternative business models besides just charging for the Internet access or for the electricity? I've thought about what kind of ""value added"" services I could charge people for realistically if I had my own place and I haven't come up with much. Do your economics really work with a bunch of students coming in and sitting for hours?",1249735920

This is a pittance, but it is 3% more than would have been solved otherwise.<p>The real drawback of CCTV is the 'false positive' rate, and the fact that people that should not have access to the data (which was sort of the point of my posted link) are able to look over the shoulder of the people in control of the cameras.

Bing was not set up with Chinese walls in place (they way it should have been done) and has been produced by a company that sees every communication with others as a marketing effort (this may be a good thing, I'm not sure).<p>They'll do everything they can to portray themselves in a good light.<p>For instance when you search on bing for microsoft vs stacker the wikipedia page that specifically adresses the lawsuit is not even in the top 10 search results, whereas it is arguably the best page on the subject on the web. Coincidence ? Possible. Probable ? I don't think so.<p>Bing has its uses, but to get objective information about its owners you'd have to look elsewhere.<p>The interesting thing with all this is that people are now so conditioned to find stuff using search engines that if a search engine does not list a page it might as well not exist.",1249735522

749228,comment,749173,749217,0,0,profquail,,,"I think the 'solution' will depend on how paranoid you want to be about security. You could count the occurrences of protocol tags and if it's more than one, don't allow the user to submit it -- however, this would break some url redirectors and print pages. Or, you could do what you said, and check the string for <i>consecutive</i> protocol tags, then discard all of them except the last one.<p>Since there is a fairly low volume of new links that need to be checked, PG could simply add a few lines of code that send an HTTP HEAD request to the url and see if it's really a valid link before accepting it (or try a HEAD, then a GET if that fails, in case the webserver doesn't handle HEAD requests properly). I think that would be the most flexible solution.",1249735058

749206,comment,748614,748614,0,0,alexbeaudet,,,"Like many other commenters, I've been dealing with sleep paralysis for some time as well, and at it's peak, on a very frequent basis (as many as 2 or 3 times per week).   I've made changes to reduce some of the supposed causes, and although the frequency has seemingly lessened, I still encounter sleep paralysis on a regular basis.  If you've never had the experience, feel lucky - it's very scary.  Even though you're conscious enough to realize what is happening, the length of the spells varies, and as it persists longer, panic often sets in.  On the off-chance that this can actually help someone, I'll share a bit about my experience, and things I've found to be helpful.<p>Personally when I ""wake"" to this state of paralysis, I often imagine that there are people close by, and despite trying to call out to them, I am unable.  This is an incredibly frustrating feeling, but it is very important to remain calm.  I find it helps to continually think about what is actually happening to you, and that it will most certainly be over in a relatively short time, no matter how long it may seem.  What's most troubling though, is that it takes only the slightest touch sensation for your body to wake up.  Therefore the urge is to try to move and create the sensation yourself, yet you are seemingly incapable (some people here have said they can wiggle their fingers or toes - I've never been able to).  If you do this, it is very easy to let panic set in - trying desperately to move and not being able to is frightening - so again it's important to relax and not futilely struggle.  In most cases it is best to just wait the scenario out.  I eventually became tired of just waiting for these bouts to end though, so I went to speak to someone about it, and they actually gave me the only tip which has ever worked for me on a fairly consistent basis: rub your tongue against the roof of your mouth.  The way it was explained to me was that the root location of the paralysis (in most cases) is situated such that it largely does no affect your mouth.  Despite not having complete control, most subjects are still capable of moving their tongues, and the palate is filled with sensitive nerve endings.  Doing this for several seconds it's usually enough of a sensation to kick-start your body into actually waking up.  It's far from a perfect solution, but given the available options, it's quite effective.",1249733523

But that doesn&#x27;t stop you from proving things.<p>I think you might have just transferred your optimism about math to code instead. How do you know your programming language is doing what you asked it to? That you asked it to do the right thing at all? That the compiled code has the correct behavior? That your hardware works as advertised and is not failing at the moment?

8376297,comment,8376166,8376202,18,0,jandrewrogers,,,"I am only responding to this to point out that your post is completely inconsistent with elementary chemistry and biomedical science, lest someone else actually take it seriously.<p>Fact: Bromine is an essential element in mammalian biology. We  <i>need</i> to consume it.<p>Fact: Bromine does not preferentially crowd out iodine. It does tend to concentrate in the same tissues as iodine for the obvious chemistry reason but it does not materially impede iodine absorption. Which has actually been measured in mammals in biomedical studies.<p>Fact: Some populations, like the Japanese, consume relatively huge quantities of bromine from natural dietary sources while still having (modestly) lower levels of thyroid disease than cultures that consume much less. This is an expected demographic result given the aforementioned biomedical research that would predict this, given that bromine does not crowd out iodine.<p>If we biologically require both iodine and bromine, which we do, it is pretty reasonable to assume that evolution makes sure the ions get to where they need to go. Human biology is full of superficially conflicting ion requirements: iodine and bromine, sodium and potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc.<p>As an added bonus, ions like bromine (and iodine) tend to be promptly excreted if you consume more than your body actually requires, so they don&#x27;t stay in your system long in any case if they are not serving a purpose. There is nothing intrinsically dangerous about bromine.",1411800453

It is good to hear, and I am happy to spread the word as I know many women and entrepreneurs of color feel discouraged because they are not &quot;from central casting&quot; or don&#x27;t &quot;pattern match.&quot; I&#x27;ve watched trends change and believe disrupted patterns, like the glitch in the movie, &quot;Wreck it Ralph,&quot; are full of potential.<p>The strategy of speaking at Historically Black Colleges (HSBUs) is encouraging.

When situations call for classification of sorts, I prefer &quot;multi-ethnic,&quot; &quot;multi-cultural,&quot; &quot;Black&quot; &quot;Black-American&quot; or &quot;of African descent&quot; (my daughter - whose father is African, is &quot;African-American&quot;). Terms like &quot;bi-racial&quot; and &quot;mulatto&quot; make me cringe. I know &quot;race&quot; is commonly used, so my suggestion is not to place blame, but to work towards a better framework for discussing diversity and reducing racial rhetoric.<p>You will, indeed, find me among the pool of applicants.

And I wonder if alien mathematics will reveal our mathematics as embarassingly parochial - and not the universal common ground usually assumed.<p>So, instead of proof, I have to fall back on intuition and working code, with their severe limitations.<p>However... studying mathematical proof has at times informed and grown my intuition, by revealing new ways to see a problem and new (bizarre and unintuitive) ways to decompose it.<p>I might have been better off never having seen this story.",1411798984

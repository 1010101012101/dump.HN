However, it doesn't mean his other conclusion is true:<p>""One thing is for sure: no entrepreneur can tell me that he needs $1 million, four programmers, and six months to launch this kind of company.""<p>The reason it was <i>that</i> cheap and took <i>that</i> little manpower to build was because the idea was so simple and fairly derivative. It's basically Digg for rumors. Hey, it might work and a lot of people might use it, but you won't find many ideas that can be built off of a Wordpress installation, even though Pligg would've been a better choice as the linked article states. If your idea amounts to a list of things that people vote on, then yes, it will take very little time to build. There just aren't that many groundbreaking concepts that fit into that mold. I guess it depends what he means by ""this kind of company"", although there aren't many definitions that would render his conclusion valid. The vast majority of ideas will take a couple of months and a few programmers to put together, although he's right about the $1 million.",1181047083

(Along with a few other choice things, e.g. there's a Feature Requests thread.)<p>I agree a good title is important, and a denser front page is good too, but that doesn't rule out an accompanying summary;  it just isn't shown on the front page.  The summary can still get shown at the top of the thread.  And it's a real boon to those reading through RSS.",1181045629

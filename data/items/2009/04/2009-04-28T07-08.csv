The discussion was in context of Mac OS X, and the technical veracity is easily confirmed:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnu</a>

The model that the Sun goes around the Earth is perfectly adequate for most people.<p>I'm not saying this is good, or that people shouldn't learn about things, but realising that other people have different priorities from mine was a big step in my life.  For many people, their model is good enough.",1240904914

The geeks at my high school (myself included) are, at least respected, and in the cases of many of my friends actually have a social life. (I'm too busy with the internet for that.)

582824,comment,581079,582143,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I don't think the number of CPUs matters. The interesting question is whether machine intelligence can do things we humans cannot do with pen and paper, either individually or as a group. You may be right about the internet and the postal service, but there's no doubt in my mind that some of the things algorithms do with data is impossible to do for humans due to cognitive limits.<p>Sure, you could try to split the work into many parts and have many people work on it, but given enough data and sufficiently complex patterns, coordinating all those people to find patterns that are not local to one such part would overwhelm the organisation.<p>I don't think it's important, but even a single machine can find patterns in large amounts of data that I cannot find with pen and paper no matter how much time I have. What machines cannot do today is make a judgement about the relevance of the patterns found.",1240902322

An agent knowledgeable about one city would be ill suited to sell homes in another. It&#x27;s very difficult for an agent to transition between cities, even if that agent is excellent at selling properties in his or her current city. Success depends too much on how much an agent knows about the local region and community. The point I was trying to make was that the amount of knowledge is relatively constant (e.g. what sellers look for in a buyer), it&#x27;s just a different body of knowledge that depends on the region.<p>>> You do realize that the number of pocket listings has grown substantially in the past several years, right?<p>No, I did not realize, sorry for my narrow perspective!<p>>> They&#x27;re far more likely to be tapped into the networks that will give their clients access to properties that haven&#x27;t hit the MLS.<p>This is again to my point - the success of an agent depends more on what they know about their region (e.g. available properties, all-cash offers vs. larger offers, etc.), than the actual amount of work.<p>IMHO it simply isn&#x27;t enough of a difference to justify a 10-fold increase in price.

It works really well and has an incredibly vibrant community, though community standards aren&#x27;t always well distributed, many people will develop/deploy libraries into the ecosystem that breaks convention at least initially.<p>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to actually learn Python, but is at a point where I&#x27;m feeling I should.

Price per litre is about 1 usd for petrol and 80 cents for diesel. This might change  in the future as the current govt. seeks to end diesel subsidies.<p>Also, It should be noted that the Total Cost of Ownership benefits is not clear cut. Diesel generally has higher Miles per gallon rating, and is cheaper in some countries like India. But diesel engines are more expensive to make, maintain (bills for routine service are higher) and do require a expensive rebuild after a few hundred thousand kilometers (Newer diesel engines have got much better in this regard).<p>On a side note, it is quite hard to find hard data on the true TCO of cars that can help consumers make a decision.",1427264503

For example, woman-man+boy= girl, but you can also get that through (woman+boy)/2=girl.

This would indicate that the vectors are only capturing similarity between words, and not and not any second order relationships between them as is commonly claimed.<p>Honestly, I wish I could discuss this directly with someone doing research in this area, because it seems to me that the vector representations really aren&#x27;t capturing relationships in the way they&#x27;re touted.

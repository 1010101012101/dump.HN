This cost adds to coding friction.<p>I don't personally use JS, but I do use C/C++ and Python. I prefer Python's syntax because I find it clean. Most of my work is in semicolon-and-brace languages, so I'm clearly familiar with that style, too. But were I to code in JS, I'd always use semicolons, because that's easier than constantly asking myself, ""Do I need a semicolon or not?""<p>As an analogy, I use my turn signal every time I make a turn in my car. Every time. Even if I'm in an empty parking lot. That way, I never have to decide, ""Should I use my turn signal?"" It's just automatic.

Technique 2 involves using a wire cooling rack, a pair of pliers to hold it, and a gas stovetop, to toast or char the bottom of the dough.<p><a href=""http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/grilled-pizza-three-ways-recipe/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/grilled-pizza...</a><p>My personal technique is to put a pizza stone in the bottom of the oven, turn it all the way up, and cook like that.  550F on a hot stone is not as hot as some people manage, but it will still cook a pizza in 4 minutes and produce a very nice char on the bottom, plus it's unlikely to set the house on fire.  It's a dangerous enterprise, however, as any pizza mismanagement will set off your smoke alarms.  My pizzas come out looking very much like Mr. Varasano's examples.  Varasano's talk about mixing, resting, and kneading is very accurate and correct - it's technique, not ingredients, which produces good pizza dough.  For home ovens at 550F, you want something less wet than Varasano's pictures, but still ""wet"" and slack compared to many doughs that you would normally work with.",1292863418

Personally, I try to deploy both, with blacklists first in line, then bayes to catch some stuff that the blacklists miss.<p>""Sender authentication"" is a vague term. If you mean verification of the sender address via various DNS lookups, then yes, that's quite useful, but still nowhere near as useful as blacklists.<p>This is how I see people setting up their spam filters in the industry.

He doesn't lean on catchphrases and slogans, and instead points to the advantages he sees in his stance, along with the advantages and disadvantages of the opposition view. Specific stances on difficult and controversial issues, in full view of the complications and complexity. I'm impressed, and wish the US had any such politicians.",1292861135

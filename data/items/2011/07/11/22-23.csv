Neither the question, nor his answer was about a tutorial.<p>> He argues against magic (IDE's, build tools),<p>Because they are learning impediments most of the times.<p>> and yet there are about 5 magic commands in 5 lines of code. (module(), compile(), export_all, ->, c()). As a reasonably experienced programmer who's never seen erlang code, I ought to be able to infer most of what those operators/function are doing but I can't.<p>And as a reasonably experienced programmer, I can understand all of it. Anecdotes don't mean much. But seriously, aren't `module`, `export_all` kind of mnemonics?<p>That wasn't the point of it though. He was showing how simple it is - you right a simple program, import it in shell, check how it works, repeat. You can pick a decent erlang book and it will tell you the basic axioms.<p>His point was you don't need loads of tools to learn them - you build on the basic blocks, and introducing git, vim, emacs, eclipse etc is a lot of cognitive overhead.<p>> Why would a super smart programmer be the right person to tell me the best way to start learning to program? I would like to hear from a highly successful TEACHER of programming.<p>To each its own - I would like to hear from someone who actually programs and is a good programmer.

Probably a lot of people want to avoid that kind of slide.<p>2. Your apparent argument is illogical. ""Racism is a form of collectivism, and that phrase is indisputably collectivist [and thus that phrase is probably racist]"" reduces to ""X is a form of Y, and Z is indisputably Y [and thus Z is probably X],"" which can be substituted with ""A murderer is a form of human, and you are indisputably human [and thus you are probably a murderer].""

In fact, ironically having Android available for $10 a phone is a great deal for small suppliers.

According to Dhanji R. Prasanna, who worked on Google Wave and Google+, Google feared that Facebook might see the slides and copy the Circles idea ( <a href=""http://rethrick.com/#google-plus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethrick.com/#google-plus</a> ):<p><i>I asked the obvious question--""While I agree that Circles is a very compelling feature, this slide deck is public. Surely someone at facebook has seen it, and it won't take them long to copy it?""<p>I was met with a sheepish, if honest look of resignation. They knew the danger of this, but were counting on the fact that facebook wouldn't be able to change something so core to their product, at least not by the time Emerald Sea got to market.<p>[...]<p>Many were visibly unhappy with his slide deck having been published for all to see (soon to be released as a book). I even heard a rumor that there was an attempt to stop or delay the book's publication.</i><p>The fear only increased when Paul Adams left for Facebook in December 2010 ( <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/20/paul-adams-googler-whose-presentation-foretold-facebook-groups-heads-to-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/20/paul-adams-googler-whose-pr...</a> ).

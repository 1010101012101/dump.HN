But some apex predators do not, and other non-predators do, and my observation is that size and danger to us are more important to our sense of respect than for the species being an apex predator.<p>Electric eels, largemouth bass, and loggerhead sea turtles[1] are apex predators, within their respective environments. Do we respect as much as we do polar bears? No, we respect them less. Do we respect them as much as we do a rhinoceros? Again, no, despite rhinos not being a predator.<p>We respect horses, elephants, and rhinos, which are herbivorous and definitely not a predator, apex or otherwise. How is our respect for these large and potentially dangerous animals any fundamentally different than for an apex predator? I certainly place a rhino higher than electric eels on my list of animals to stay far away from. I get no sense that there are different categories of respect based specifically on being an apex predator.<p>Gorillas are mostly herbivorous but sometimes eat meat, and adult gorillas have no natural predators - are they apex predators, and do we respect them for their &#x27;expensive kills&#x27;? No.<p>We certainly respect the Andean Condor, that being a national symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Adults have no natural predators, but it&#x27;s primarily a scavenger and not a predator. Your thesis, however, is that our respect for the condor is fundamentally different (and lesser?) than that of the bald eagle. I don&#x27;t agree. Can you elaborate?<p>Nor do I accept your use of the term &quot;advantageous behavior.&quot; You focus on its use for killing, but advantageous behavior also applies to vultures scavenging from a carcass, for squirrels eating seeds, for dung beetles which consume feces, and for the phototropic effect in plants.<p>That is, you correctly said that &#x27;in the state of nature killing is morally neutral&#x27;. My complaint is that the better statement is &#x27;in the state of nature everything is morally neutral.&#x27; Focusing on the narrow topic of killing reveals more your own fascination for that one issue than anything else.<p>[1] Loggerhead turtles are an apex predator in Florida Bay <a href=""http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/sferpm/fy02/Schroeder02_abstract.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/sferpm/fy02/Schroeder02_abstrac...</a>",1376300360

Ever since George Brocklehurst described this at Ruby Manor earlier this year I can&#x27;t get the idea out of my head.  If you look at all the security issues and hand wringing over params parsing, roles, attr_accessible and strong attributes, etc, etc, a very large percentage of those issues are greatly improved or in some cases completely nullified by Django&#x27;s approach to forms.  It&#x27;s actually one of the biggest Rails warts in my opinion.<p>In essence, the idea there should be an object that knows how to render a form based on an internal object state paired with a deserializer that knows how to read the form in and convert it to an internal object state.  This way, by default, the form only recognizes the params that were defined and the risk of leaky params causing security issues is reduced by orders of magnitude.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you retrofit something like this into Rails since it would be a huge architectural shift, but man it would be sweet to see something official along those lines.",1376299519

Wireworld has four cell statesdead, wire, head, and tailwhere dead cells stay dead; heads decay into tails, and tails into wires; wires become heads when excited by one or two heads; and wires stay wires otherwise. You can easily see how this gives rise to the electrons on the subway effect.<p>And in this system its fairly straightforward to actually build systems that compute thingsalbeit glacially slow. Contrast that with the Game of Life, where computation is more of an interesting emergent behaviour thats about as easy as butterfly programming.",1376298538

Wordpress is known for its ease-of-use and large number of plugins and high quality templates. Drupal has a higher learning curve but is very stable, highly customizable, and powers some very large websites. ...And then there I Joomla. The admin interface hasn't been updated signaificantly in years. While Wordpress and Drupal continue to innovate an incorporate new features, Joomla's development seems to be stuck at a stand still. There are many plugins available but the quality is not nearly a stable as Wordpress or Drupal plugins. Most importantly, Joomla isn't best in class for any category - features, ease-of-use, etc. Joomla appears to be entirely mediocre in every way. I'd like to hear from the Joomla people out there why they use Joomla. Thanks for the discussion.",1278805578

1504544,story,,,9,5,luu,"Ask HN: Great hardware companies?",,"Every week I see a blog post about how awesome the work environment and people at Google are, and I hear similar stories about certain groups at places like MS and amazon; every time a “who’s hiring” post comes up, we get a list of tens of small software companies that sound amazing. But what about hardware companies?<p>I’ve been interviewing at hardware companies, and when I ask employees about finding a place that’s full of brilliant people, good management, etc., the only people who say their own company fits that description are people who have only worked at one place since graduating[1]. I don’t think they’re being disingenuous, but they don’t have much to compare against. Folks with more experience tell me how great Cray, DEC, Xilinx before Moshe Gavrielov, Bell Labs, etc., were, but all of those places are defunct, or shells of their former selves. There are some well known large hardware companies that regularly make Forbes’s best places to work list, but the general reputation that those companies have in industry is not very good, and the people I know that work at those places are, for the most part, unhappy with their jobs. Great hardware companies must exist. Where are they, and how do I find them?<p>A related question is: are there any hardware companies that aggressively screen their applicants? I’ve interviewed with all of the major companies and a lot of smaller companies. Without exception, the on-site interview at hardware companies has been easier than the phone screen at software places like Google or Facebook. Having a strict hiring process isn’t a sufficient condition for getting great employees, but it’s probably at least weakly correlated. So how come all of the major players have such a loose hiring screen?<p>[1] I found one exception when I was searching for jobs when I graduated, and I took a position there. The problem is that I took a verification (i.e., test) position. Unlike at (some) software companies, hardware verification folks are treated as first class citizens, and the work is really interesting, but I want to try doing design (i.e., development) and I’ve accumulated enough verification experience that I’ll be typecast as a verification engineer for my career if I don’t make a change soon. Unfortunately, the aforementioned company only hires experienced designers to do design, so I’m stuck choosing between closing off one career path and having great co-workers in a work environment that has all the plusses that I hear Google has, and breaking out of verification.",1278805118

I found eventually, that no one every really knew a good design.  It seems like we always invented that along the way.  Yeah, we all knew patterns etc, and were bound to certain ways of doing things, but somehow we seemed to always get lucky on most designs.  It quite possibly may have been that the problems solved themselves eventually.  And after we saw the code we wrote we looked at it made it better on the last few days creating, in most cases, an elegant design.  The designs were more apparent after the project was done which were never consistent from project to project.<p>One way to learn good software design is to look at other peoples code who are good at what they do.  For me those people are John Resig, Douglas Crockford, etc.",1278804885

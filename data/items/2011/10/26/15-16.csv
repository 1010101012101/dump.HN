It has two critical limitations: an individual mind can only handle so much, and different minds don't compose easily. Yeah, XP was absolutely an attempt to address that. Did it work? Not in my book. It doesn't take the creative process seriously enough - not even close. Instead it regards creative minds as something to be harnessed as a resource (a nicer way of saying exploited). My body rejects that.<p>Another way of putting this critique is that XP is designed to work inside existing companies that are incapable of tolerating the forms of organization needed to produce software well, when what we ought to be doing is starting new and much smaller organizations, which in the local dialect I believe is called ""startups"". Of course it's not that easy, because once startups begin to grow, they bring back the old organizational assumptions. But that just means we need more deviant startups.<p>You, on the other hand, think there exist paradigms of abstraction that can fit the complex systems we're trying to build well enough to make the process tractable.

If you have ten ""bits"", but they tend to be highly correlated together such that they are usually all 0 or all 1, you in fact <i>don't</i> have ten bits in information theory. Ten bits are, by definition, ten fully-independent true or false values. Bits-in-memory are not the same as information-theory-bits. A real system with 10,000 bits can not, pretty much by definition, be modeled by 100 bits. If it could, it would be a system with only 100 bits in the first place.

From what I can see the best games seem to come out of a sense of professional dedication to the ultimate product and the customer. Someone who is passionate tends to pick something up and work really hard on it for a while, but release it half-baked and ultimately unfinished. Id software's recent work is an example.<p>Contrast this with highly professional game organizations like Valve or Blizzard where, yes, there is passion for games, but there's something else too: a highly professional dedication to polish, completion, continuous refinement of game mechanics, etc. The latter simply produces better games.<p>And, uh, duh that a high level of talent is not enough to launch you into a position of major influence. That should be obvious. Everyone thinks they have talent, and it's expensive to even evaluate those claims.

I think the main group of people that use the current, rather poor tutorials are newbie(or even experienced) developers that have inherited Perl code that uses the language in a way that they have never encountered before.  Those devs need a good way to find all the insane single character typing optimizations built into the language.<p>If you have a script that consists of one 1500 character line with approximately 10 alphanumeric characters total, well written Perl examples aren't going to help you figure it out that much.<p>Sure, it will help if you're a complete newbie to Perl, and learning it from scratch.

Personally, when I did live paycheck to paycheck I had nothing but time. For most Americans, more money means bigger bills. Got a raise worth $300/mo? Let's go get a new car that's going to cost us $400/mo!<p>I understand that some people work multiple jobs, take care of kids, etc. Those people barely have time to breathe, let alone manage finances. Even so, managing finances is a fact of life.<p>Time, more money or whatever else you can think of will not break the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. It requires a change in attitude and habits. The first simple fact is you have to spend less than you earn. It's a basic concept that so many people fail to grasp. If it's payday and you have leftover money from the last check you have savings. Don't go out and spend it like it's found money. Set it aside. Do this over and over again and you have an ""emergency fund"". Guess what? Now you are not living paycheck to paycheck. The second is that you have to take on an active role in managing finances in order to accomplish this. That means planning, budgeting, tracking and adjusting. The most difficult part is making the decision to start and then taking the first step.<p>There a hundred excuses one could come up with for living paycheck to paycheck, having debt or some other financial mess. Predatory banks, too little money (when still earning more than a reasonable amount), not enough time. None of it changes the fact that you are still living paycheck to paycheck. The only thing that changes that is planning your own finances instead of letting these other things plan for you.",1319642462
3158927,comment,3158276,3158784,4,0,w0utert,,,"I think you are missing the point here. I'm not saying Perl is hard or impossible to program, or that it is 'bad' or anything, just that Perl code very often comes out obfuscated and hard to interpret, even for someone who knows many other programming languages.<p>Example: instead of '$^P |= 0x10', something along the lines of 'sys.debug = True' is a lot easier to read, right? Perl code is full of such examples, I could make up at least 20 examples from the module linked to before in this thread, all using alternatives resembling different other languages, and all much easier to interpret.<p>The problem with Perl (as far as I can judge) is that it tries to cram too many different things into operators and magic variables, and that it allows too much wonky stuff that might come in handy to shave off a few characters if you are a guru, but could just as well have been left out, sacrificing compactness for readability. Another thing that Perl seems to lack is orthogonality, I always get the impression that the language allows you to solve the same problem in 10 different ways.<p>Just to give a counter-example, take a look at Objective-C code, which is almost the antithesis of Perl. It's almost self-documenting because of the naming conventions, named parameters, the way the frameworks are designed, etc. Sure, it's about 10 times more verbose than Perl, and the core language probably has 10 times less features, but if you have a good editor and don't try to obsessively do things 'your way' instead of 'the Objective-C way', it's a joy to work with.<p>If you spend enough time in the Perl world, of course you'll get used to the language features and syntax of the language, and forget about how long it took to get to that point. At that point it's probably a perfectly fine and powerful language that allows very fast development.<p>> The libraries available are the most important asset of a language, more important than the language itself<p>100% agreed, but most other popular languages also have huge libraries (core SDK libraries or third-party). At some point you reach some kind of critical mass where you can solve 99% of the problems using native libraries, leaving only 1% that requires bindings to e.g. C/C++, shell exec, RPC, etc. Most other languages already reached that point or make it easy enough to interface with other languages that have more libraries, to the extent lack of libraries is not an issue anymore (such as Objective-C, for example).",1319642446

3158901,comment,3158276,3158787,11,0,skimbrel,,,"They weren't originally intended to provide namespacing, as far as I know. They were there to make the compiler's life easier.<p>The reason that an array subscript is ""$foo[0]"" is because the $ sigil means ""HEY COMPILER, the expression here is going to evaluate to some scalar"".<p>@foo is the entire list and the compiler treats it as a list type; $foo[0] is an element of the list and needs storage/behavior of a scalar. Same thing for hashes: %bar is the whole hash; $bar{quux} is an element and must be treated by the compiler as a scalar.<p>The programmer must remember that square braces mean array subscript and curly braces mean hash lookup.<p>So basically, this is a compiler optimization implemented by having the programmer provide hints to the compiler. It's overhead that probably isn't needed in the modern age, but we're effectively stuck with it. It wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't made the second (and IMO worse) decision:<p>You can reuse symbols across contexts. The way this works is that the compiler maintains a symbol table where each symbol has a slot available for each of the types (scalar $, array @, hash %, subroutine &). This was originally the way to emulate pass-by-reference: you'd write a subroutine that assigned its arguments into typeglobs (* foo  think of it as a wildcard for all things named foo that behaves as a magic scalar with the contents of foo's symbol table entry) and then pulled them back out as the types it wanted:<p><pre><code>  local(*foo) = @_;\n  foreach $bar (@foo) {\n    do_something($bar);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis amounts to telling the compiler ""I want to alias the name foo in all contexts to my argument, and then go look at what's stored in the array at that name"" and is a poor man's pass-by-reference.<p>Perl 5 has a real reference system that completely obviates the need for this, except for the case of monkey-patching a subroutine, where you still say:<p><pre><code>  local *Package::quux = sub { ... }""\n</code></pre>\nWhat's left is an unfortunate case where things like the GP mentioned ($bar = $foo[$foo]) are possible, and people who think they're being clever will do these things.

I found myself, just like Steve Yegge says in his ancient languages blog post, having to memorize all the special edge case rules and idioms of the language just to get anything done. Whenever I got to choose Python, Ruby, or C for a task I felt like I was breathing fresh air again after being stuck in a musty room for a while.<p>I remember being offered to choose any toolset I wanted for a particular project and finding out that Perl was the only scripting language that had the bindings to the C libraries I needed to use. Naturally, I decided to to do the whole project in straight C instead. :)<p>The funny thing is, whenever I would code in Perl for a while, I would actually grow acclimated to it. I would start to think to myself, ""Hey! I'm finally getting things done. I CAN be productive in this language!"" It was only after switching away to another language again that I would re-recognize just how painful Perl really is. This experience actually repeated itself multiple times for me as I moved on and off Perl projects and it helped me learn to sympathize more with others who are perfectly content to code in Perl for a living.<p>At one point, I had enough and began recording all the weird Perlisms that were wasting my time as I encountered them. My goal was to compile a ""95 theses against Perl"" document and post it on my manager's door as a joke. Fortunately, I only got into the 40s before my manager offered to let me move to another team where I never had to write a line of Perl again in that job!<p>It's possible to write good Perl just like it's possible to write good COBOL, and better tutorials would definitely help newcomers to the language do just that.

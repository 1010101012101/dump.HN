834031,comment,832780,833622,0,0,netsp,,,"China is definitely an interesting high level examples of what leads to growth. Surely its quite hard to say that the China could have grown faster if only XYZ. If there is always a correlation between growth and state non-intervention, it either does not apply in every case or isn't the only (or even the the strongest) predictor of economic growth.<p>I have heard a reasonably coherent argument that a strong central system can be beneficial to a state that is ""behind."" These are less reliant on big revolutionary innovations. They have industries that get a lot of benefit from just simple capital investment. Basically, since you can see the path to a more prosperous future relatively clearly from the present, you can plan the economy more efficiently. In some cases this might be more efficient then allowing the economy to plan its own course.<p>Take some large country with an underdeveloped economy but no prohibitive political or social hang-ups. If you try to imagine a prosperous future for it, you can usually see some of the parts of it. Agricultural methods (assuming that you think agriculture will play a big part of that economy) will need to improve. This will over time, yield 2-3 times more crops with the same amount of land and fewer workers. You know what those methods are and you might even be able to guess at the appropriate ownership structure (micro farmers vs larger farmers with employees vs cooperatives vs corporate farms, etc.) because you have examples. The country might need a industrial/manufacturing industry. You don't really need the market to figure out what a good industrial complex looks like or what conditions are needed because you have examples.<p>Germany (to take a random example) is not really in that position. You won't be as accurate in your guesses.",1253508931

Yeah, your life is much easier if you have friends from high school who became coders while you went off into banking.  And, yeah, it's all-but-impossible to find great coders except by happenstance, but it doesn't make this advice any less true.<p>Of course, someone (maybe not necessarily VCs and angels) could make a killing if they would match up interested business guys with experience and understanding of large markets with brilliant technical people, but I suppose that hasn't happened to date for some reason.

What if they continue to believe this, in spite of your appeals that it was your software that helped the sales force along?<p>A company managed this way is a company that will have little left but a sales and marketing force eventually, because the executive staff will have pruned everyone else as being redundant. Arguably, this could happen even in a shrinkwrapped software company, where the software isn't just a vital part of the business, it is the <i>only</i> part.<p>Hire someone incompetent, or see someone incompetent get hired above you, you may find you'll be made ""redundant"" even if you are the last developer hacking on the product.

Around the end of college, I had a bit of a quarter-life crisis, and I ended up applying reason to my religion in the way talked about in this article.  I joined a Christian missionary organization, and was determined to ""go therefore in to all the world and preach the gospel to all nations"", one of the typically semi-ignored Christian commands.<p>I was also convinced that it would be a good idea to prove that the key disputed points of Christianity were in fact correct.  I went on skepticsannotatedbible.com and the Atheism sub-reddit and compiled a list of arguments to refute.  I couldn't refute enough of them, and so found myself in a conundrum.  I ended up choosing to live in the real world.<p>Most of my close friends, however, are still from the Christian communities I used to frequent.  I prod and poke them mentally a little bit.  Its amazing to me how Christians can justify almost anything, as long as their community mostly agrees with them.  I have a group of friends who go to church multiple times per week, and have no problems sleeping with their boy/girlfriends.  I have gay Christian friends, Christian friends who are bartenders, etc.  My parents would be livid.<p>Anyhow, I just wanted to point out that when I think back about my life so far, the part of it that scares me, was when I took my religion and decided that I had to take it seriously and <i>do something</i>.",1253507405

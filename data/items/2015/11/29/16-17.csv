10645155,comment,10644525,10645066,0,0,c3534l,,,"I kind of agree with this, but having recovered myself, I&#x27;ve found that addiction is more than just your drug of choice, it manifests itself in all sorts of little things. People find they quit drinking and then realize they&#x27;ve been compulsively shopping or eating. The same basic mechanism is the same and I think the author nails what it is: a cognitive-behavioral loop one has difficulty getting out of primarily because your brain is overvaluing the short-term over the long term for just long enough to engage in the cycle and strengthen the compulsion. Of course there&#x27;s physical addiction, but not everyone likes that distinction. That is certainly powerful, but it&#x27;s powerful to the extent that it makes the psychological addiction that much stronger, by having these very immediate responses with a clear behavioral solution (use your drug of choice).<p>There are people with really severe addictions, sure. In rehab there was no shortage of people who had to be monitored 24/7 and medicated because suddenly stopping their drug could actually kill them. There were others who were not as desperate. But I think it really is the same underlying phenomenon: substance abuse as well as gambling or some people who overeat or whatever else people typically need to go to rehab for - those addictions simply are greater and tend to have worse impact on a person&#x27;s life. I was in rehab for alcohol having already quit every other drug at that point (causing my precariously balanced array of simultaneous addictions to cause one of them to dive head-first into the ground) and I wouldn&#x27;t say that my addiction was the same as the heroin or cocaine addicts&#x27; problems. It simply was not in the same class, so I think there&#x27;s already a recognition that everyone&#x27;s addiction is different and unique to them.<p>Also, fuck, I&#x27;m clearly addicted to internet distraction. I&#x27;m writing this post instead of finishing my research paper.",1448816380

It would be much smaller and cheaper, quicker to build, and produce 500MW [1]. UW&#x27;s Dynomak is similar to tokamaks, but eliminates most of the superconductors. Capital cost of a 1 GW plant would be similar to a coal plant [2].<p>Those are both mainstream projects that leverage the work on tokamaks, so the risk is relatively low. A bunch of companies are pursuing higher-risk alternatives that could be even better. Tri Alpha, for example, recently achieved stable plasma in their field-reversed configuration [3]; their last milestone is to increase temperature, and see whether the plasma gets more stable as their model predicts. Last I saw, they were planning a 100MW reactor.

This makes it incredibly hard to analyze the code structure and infer the methods and properties a certain instance may hold.<p>ES6 may help with this, but it will be a long time before ES6 are natively supported and ES6 class syntax are adopted among devs.",1448815992

The former language has to deal with at least 2 different ecosystems: NodeJS and Browser and the latter usually try its best to give consistent experience everywhere. One would argue that optimizing for specific environment is better but in the case of JavaScript, I don&#x27;t feel that way.<p>The library/tools churn in JavaScript is another issue that a few people have raised as a concern. I used to think that companies are crazy (or wasteful) to create their own collection/mvc/widget/utility libraries or tools but I suppose it&#x27;s better than to migrate from one used-to-be-popular library to another current-du-jour library by the time your infrastructure (build, test, packaging pipeline) is already set in stone and you&#x27;re focusing on building products.<p>JavaScript for large app/large team, does it work? yes it does. But you have to be _very_ discipline and skilled. Apprenticeship might work for C#/C++/Java/Rails (yes, Rails specifically) but it&#x27;s definitely harder in JavaScript. Some people might not like to hear this but for a large team/large app, you have to impose structure, convention, rules, etc which may be at odds with the liberty/freedom that JavaScript can offer.<p>Those DO&#x27;s items for JavaScript such as to build small contained function/libraries may not applied as-is given certain complex requirements (say Single Page App). Eventually your controller/presenter code evolve (sure, we still try our best to break down the complexity but it won&#x27;t be as cute as underscore library).<p>Disclaimer: I use JavaScript every day and am part of the team that builds large products (SAP Lumira, SAP Cloud for Analytics) using JavaScript (90-95% of the code base, front-end and back-end.

What is important about Haskell is the equational reasoning (algebraic thinking, if you will) you can do, not static typing. Static typing is just a vehicle to be able to pull it off.<p>There is a payoff already - see my comment to Lisp guy above. We could also talk about how monads made LINQ great, or how streams in Java have to be more complicated than necessary because the language wasn&#x27;t very well formally defined.<p>And there will be bigger payoff in the future, when we will learn for example how to type a whole big software component correctly (like a web service). So far, it&#x27;s an art driven by engineering intuition; but formalization will help to make more robust systems.<p>The payoff is also assumed based on experience with other branches of mathematics (as I was alluding in my first comment), where historically, the formalization always paid off.

During that time, I frequently noted that the engineers who were promoted to the top were specialists in one or more areas important to that company&#x27;s goals.  My managers always told me I was mistaken about that.<p>So eventually I specialized in one of those areas and got promoted myself during the 2nd half, so much so that Google poached me (that didn&#x27;t end well, but that&#x27;s another story).  These days, I work amongst the full-stack crowd who want everything written in Python so they can modify supposedly low-level inner loops with impunity.  When repeatedly confronted with a C or GPU procedure that is 50-100x faster than its Python equivalent (dynamic typing in inner loops is a harsh mistress and even numpy can make Python coders do really strange things leaving one with code still 5-10x slower than bespoke C/GPU code), they complain about the difficulty of writing C/GPU code rather than consider the performance they&#x27;re leaving on the table and the money they&#x27;re wasting by running performance-sensitive code that way.<p>But then, I&#x27;ve always considered getting my hands dirty and rooting out bizarro bugs the fun part.  The hardest part for me is when to say a project is done because I can always find room for improvement.  And I prefer to work with people who have a similar viewpoint.

Methods are compiled when they are first called. Then, of course, full type information for the arguments is available. That&#x27;s quite enough for Matlab-style code with the occasional JITted method.\nBut Julia has one glaring disadvantage for everything beyond that: The return type of methods cannot be specified / enforced.<p>1) With &quot;black box&quot; methods (where the return type cannot be inferred as in this DataFrames article) the code becomes horribly slow. And you have to dig into the internal method representations to become aware of the type inference results.<p>2) It hurts the ability of Julia to produce binary executables. When the types are not 100% inferrable, the entire JIT infrastructure needs to be dragged along.<p>3) Types are not only an aid for the compiler, but also an aid for the programmer. With SIUnits [1] and method return types, Julia could even tell when the physics represented in the code is flawed!!<p>If Julia&#x27;s type system were stronger, it could become a prime platform to develop Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). That could lead to a great unification of symbolic and numerical &quot;computation platforms&quot;. However, current Julia is unable to represent the mathematics encoded in the type system of open source CAS like Axiom [2]. Also note the github issue on Julia and dependent typing [3].<p>Imho, there is still a great potential for the Julia type system without breaking existing code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Keno/SIUnits.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Keno/SIUnits.jl</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.2331&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27....</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/6113"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/6113</a>",1448813612

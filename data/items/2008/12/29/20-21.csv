413424,comment,413047,413402,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"<i>without all the ""Foobar foobar = new Foobar()"" crap</i><p>Exactly. You will spend less time restating things the compiler should be able to figure out by itself.<p>Vanilla H-M type inference (as in SML and OCaml) requires you to write code which the type inference <i>can completely resolve</i>, however. This tends to lead to compilers that seem really strict until you learn to work <i>with</i> rather than against them, but are excellent at catching several entire categories of bugs at compile-time. The type inference also works with complicated higher-order functions (where the full type signature might be several lines long!), not just trivial examples, and rapidly determines what code will be affected by any small changes, but it can add a little more friction to rapidly changing code, and every once in a while you will still need to do things to appease it.<p>Whether or not this is a net plus or minus depends on your programming style, the project, etc. (Dynamically-typed languages don't need type annotations either, but they have different trade-offs.)",1230584129

413422,comment,412912,413182,0,0,azanar,,,"> As a commenter on Joel's blog mentioned, Sturgeon's law applies: 90% of everything is crap.<p>As I asked in the other thread too, are we prepared just to accept this as a truism. There is a fine line between fundamental law of the universe and self-fulfilling belief. Because the result is the same, you won't know whether to look to see if the latter cause is culpable. Is it possible that 90% of everything is crap because 90% of what we believe to be true, and thus act on, is crap.<p>>Start your own company or even try working for someone else, use your crappy source of steady income to look for a better job.<p>I might be getting the implication wrong, but I wouldn't advocate starting your own company just because all the other options suck worse. Do it because you are driven to, not because <i>just</i> want to avoid the other options, but are apathetic otherwise.<p>> If you truly look at code as art, then digging ditches by day and writing beautiful open source code by night, might be preferable to churning out crap code for pay.<p>What stops you from churning out code during the day, and then churning out other code later on in the evening? And why the assumption that the alternative to crap code for pay is ditch-digging? Perhaps the alternative is advocating for good code? Robert Martin has a whole section in <i>Clean Code</i> where he argues, and well so in my mind, that crap code is our fault as developers. To bail to ditch-digging is a tacit admission that it isn't, and that we were made to write crap by force. Which brings on a more general thought.<p>Through all of this, I have yet to find anyone advocating for the other option besides either putting up with crap or getting up and walking out of your current employer and perhaps the industry as a whole. It seems that the unspoken assumption is that speaking up and being assertive where you are now is an unavailable option. This leads to several questions regarding the validity and basis of that assumption. I understand it is common wisdom to shut up and get back to work, but I've not always found common wisdom to be that wise.",1230584058

413410,comment,413242,413372,0,0,nostrademons,,,"What I did in college was to run the guitar through a digital effects board and then into my cheapo computer speakers (which could be set to reasonable volume levels) or into headphones.  Sound quality isn't as great, of course, but the digital stuff doesn't really care how loud you play and sounds about the same at all volume levels.  You could get some pretty decent tones out of the higher-end effects boards, too.<p>If you want sweet tube amp sound, you're basically out of luck.  That's caused by the power tubes and speakers distorting (<i>not</i> the pre-amp tubes), so you've gotta crank them up to 11.<p>There're also some products available that cut the power ratings on standard amplifiers.  When I was into this stuff around 1998, your options were basically limited to YellowJackets (which let you substitute 18W EL84 tubes for EL34 amplifiers, like 50W and 100W Marshalls) and the PowerSink, which was an induction coil that would bleed off excess power as heat before it reached the speaker.  Both of these would only cut the noise level from ""will blow your eardrums out"" to ""will annoy the neighbors"", and so weren't really suitable for apartments or dorms.  Since then, I've heard that a bunch of manufacturers have wised up that there's a huge market in low-power tube amps, and it looks like you may be able to find 1-5W tube amps out there now.",1230583222

She had a rare disease which she got treatment for but which ultimately led to her death, and through it all we kept a blog about her life. I'm an emotional SOB so I can't stand to read much of it, but at times I do like to go back through her blog and remember her.<p>Also, I discovered in her possessions a small booklet she kept for part of my childhood along the lines of what you describe. I wish I still had it, I think it's in my dad's house, but your post has made me remember it and I think I'll be looking to find it again.<p>One alternative, turning to the technology, is that you might consider a blog engine rather than an email post. You can make it private and not share it with the world, but when it comes to archiving the messages, email does not make it easy to print. So maybe a Tumblr account or something like that which would be more conducive to future desires to print it.",1230581784

This comment and the one above it seem latent with severe blowhard sentiment, where one declares that <i>x</i> sucks, and the other declares things other than <i>x</i> that suck more. It takes some of the wind out of the argument they are trying to make, which maybe are worth exploring further.<p>Is there age discrimination in programming? Probably, although I've had at least one manager assert to me, with some plausible evidence, that reverse age discrimination also exists.<p>But, unfortunately, that conversation gets drowned out in cynicism and hyperbole, and oneupsmanship by additional cynicism. It is tiring, because all it succeeds in doing is creating additional angst and frustration.<p>In the people who believe what is being said, they now believe they are now facing down a life consisting of death marches and idiocy, with the other option being indefinite unemployment. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where they will engender that kind of attitude in the places they work and live; with some regularity, what they expect a place to be like is what it will become.<p>For the people who try to fight against that sentiment but find their thoughts, however reasonable, drowned out in the sea of people who claim that they lack sufficient context simply because they lack the requisite cynicism, they'll eventually give up and either succumb to the prophecy or just leave the community to its own misery.<p>To this I ask, do we really need more cynicism, and is it really deserved? Are we certain this hasn't gone past discussing things reasonably, into the realm where people attempt to out-gloom one another in hopes that it justifies them tolerating their own plight? When do we stop admitting the inevitability of this and start taking action to change that, or at least investigating deeper what action can be taken? How are we so certain that all of these crappy programming jobs that we look at with disdain aren't the product of the cynicism of people, perhaps like us, who currently work in them and make them and the rest of the culture that way? It is, to me, increasingly hard to tell where things honestly suck, and where people make them suck for the sake of producing drama and fulfilling their own expectations of misery.<p>I agree with Joel; this is the textbook definition (if there were a textbook) of a mutual self-confirmation club, and I worry that it exists even here on HN.",1230581619

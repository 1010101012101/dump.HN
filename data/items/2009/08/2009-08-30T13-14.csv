A bridge was built in my city - Bombay, India - that costed 4 - 5 times as much as this moon programme.  Both of these do less towards providing the Indian poor with basic facilities than the moon mission. I can cite numerous other instances.  Also, the BBC did not mention India's dying poor lacking basic services while reporting on these programmes.  This BBC report is decidedly shoddy, crass and is a shame.<p>Chandrayaan-I was India's first mission to the moon.  It spent 317 days in orbit and finished 95% of it's scientific objectives.  The star sensor which was used by the orbiter's nav system to  orient itself using relative star positions died a few months ago due to overheating. The  Indian scientists hacked up a scheme to use the on board gyroscope and the pics taken of the lunar surface to keep it in orbit all this while.  ISRO has declared the mission as successful despite it falling short of it's 2 year mission life.  Also, it is worth noting that this mission planted the first Indian flag on the moon through it's moon impact probe.<p>I for one can't wait for Chandrayaan II wherein India plans to get a robotic rover landed on the moon.

794434,comment,793767,794021,0,0,raganwald,,,"Funny you mention that. If you had your own implementation of variables, you could probably override the behaviour of parameters in the #returning method to get the behavior in the OP without rewriting code.<p>Naturally the syntax looks a little ugly to the ALGOL-shaped eye, but imagine such a thing written <i>into the language</i>. It would be trivial to permit the ALOGOL-like syntax in the code but also allow you to override the #get and #set methods when you want to.<p>IIRC, this is exactly what Generalized Variables are in Common Lisp. Variables where you override the meaning of setting and getting their value.<p>Ruby sorta kinda allows this in a very limited case. While you cannot override the meaning of:<p><pre><code>    foo = ""foo""
</code></pre>
You <i>can</i> create setter method such as:<p><pre><code>    class MyStack
      
      # ...

      def top
        @array[-1]
      end

      def top=(value)

Under 23.1, dragging to an Emacs frame pastes the contents of the dragged file into the open buffer. (Also annoyingly, dragging to Emacs' dock icon opens a new frame on the same Space as the most-recently-used frame, but luckily (setq ns-pop-up-frames nil) fixes that.)",1251637545

In house uses Oracle, said developer uses a lot of PL/SQL only because it allowed him to shave 30 hrs of the project. Adds 100hrs to 2.0 because the logic has to be build and the database layer has to be retrofitted to existing logic, not to mentioned QA'ed stable code will now be rewritten in 2.0 so it does not have the burn in that 1.0 provided.

I am not saying you go out and build every hook for ever feature that will be invented but not knowing the road map is a universally bad idea.<p>A good example of one that we dealt with when building a reservation system for one of the big online travel companies was the idea of optimal discount pattern. The hotel industry has millions of permutations of these discounts like stay 7 nights get 2 free, or stay 5 and get 25% off or stay 4 and kids are free.<p>The company was fine with us adding a predefined set of these and just finding the longest duration and applying that one for the minimum viable product. We did some more digging and pressed them on this an sure enough it release 3 they where going to build out the routine to find the most optimal savings as well as the ability to add them dynamically via a rules engine. We added 10hrs to the project to make this a plug-in architecture where these patterns could be added as a plug-in. We estimated that it saved 500hrs given that all of the predefined ones where built as plug-ins and did not have to be touched or QA'ed in subsequent releases. Had we not known about that architectural need it would have been a mess to rip out that code and replace it with a plug-able architecture.",1277005382

the Labs at that time.  My dept was directly responsible
for two of them.<p>I do not recall the Dick Tracy watch but the
projects behind the books on-line, video-on-demand and
""EZ Pass"" were being done at HO and MH.<p>Others were products or concepts in the pipeline

tickets from a cash machine -- NCR ATMs).<p>Some things shown were straight line
extrapolations from core technologies that had existed 
in the Labs for some time (e.g. driving across the country

Labs never made it into real products from AT&T

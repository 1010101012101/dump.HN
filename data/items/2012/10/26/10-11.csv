My story is a bit different, in that i did not intentionally create a startup for growing a business brand as such.<p>Back in 2010, one of my siblings approached me and asked me if her nose was too big, but was too afraid to post on social sites(guess she didn't want her friends to laugh at her or just wanted opinions from people who did not know here), and being a ""hobbyist"" programmer(learning ROR) at the time i thought this would be a good project to help develop my skills(no plan of developing a brand). Finally in mid October this year i completed the project and launched the app.<p>We now have 32 users(not much) and have already asked us to change things on the app(like add some features). My question to all you guru's out there, is what should i do? Carry on, got no hope, bad design, wasting my time, sell, go to startup school, etc.",1351249146

4701650,comment,4701321,4701321,4,0,gall,,,"My best bursts of rapid learning are almost always project/puzzle driven. I didn't, for instance, set out to master FFT directly, but it seemed like something that could improve my abysmal performance on a Project Euler that I was working on, so I looked into it. I question (open-mindedly, not snarkily) the efficiency of ploughing through a course or series of courses. On the one hand there's the possibility of cross-pollination that having all sorts of cool bits of knowledge and techniques fraternizing in one's head for as long as possible promotes. On the other hand, there's the sense that the most efficient learning sequence is the one that matches the actual sequence of problems as they present themselves. Just-in-time learning of helicoptering, but if and only if you find yourself in a rooftop gunfight, as it were. Of course, then the issue becomes predicting forthcoming problems with enough lead time to learn the solution.",1351249092
4701649,comment,4701321,4701632,1,0,goldfeld,,,"Yeah, I find the best learning happens when you put that knowledge immediately to work in a real world problem, and preferably one that's meaningful to you, as opposed to most term projects. And that's where learning for yourself makes so much more sense; if you're learning for yourself then you probably already have a real world application for it which got you into the goal of learning it in the first place.",1351249057

4701632,comment,4701321,4701321,5,0,hdivider,,,"Learning for exams and learning for yourself are obviously different kinds of activities, even if the level of depth and rigour are similar.<p>For maths-heavy subjects, I'm not really inclined to believe that traditional exams are the best way to assess a student's knowledge and understanding of the material (especially with regard to rote memorisation). Exams in such subjects haven't changed fundamentally in many many decades, even though we now have lots and lots of new things we could do with them.<p>For instance: do more with computers - like getting the students to solve real-world, many-tentacled, hairy problems by numerical methods, rather than giving them some carefully pruned equation that just happens to have nice analytical solutions. Or introduce more computer-assisted mathematical modelling (e.g. use classical mechanics, to start with). Or on the pure front, teach students to write or at least understand some interesting automated theorem prover.<p>Stuff like that.<p>I suspect that traditional exams have survived simply because they serve their purpose: a percentage of exam-takers fail the exam (which allows the exam-setters to claim that their standards of assessment are rigorous), and a fair percentage will pass the exam, some with flying colours. Whether or not the actual learning goal was achieved has not been determined, since the exam is deemed to be the only instrument that can measure that.",1351248612

Took all the required freshman through senior level classes at the same time, each semester, and finished all the requirements for a chemical engineering degree in a year. I loved MIT for this reason - they had no rules/regulations on the number of classes you could take in any semester, and they didn't enforce prerequisites/corequisites. Very different than other institutions I've trained at. I was still able to participate in extracurricular activities and develop relationships with lots of people.<p>It's true that I didn't attend a lot of classes (since they all overlapped anyways), and had 2-3exams virtually every week. The only issue I see is that there is only so much you can do online. I also did the same thing with Chemistry and Biology, which had lots of laboratory classes, and I don't see how one could gain the practical experience of putting knowledge to work in those fields without a wet lab class. EECS however is amenable to this (for the most part - likely hard for an optics laboratory), and most of my EECS labs were really done in Athena clusters instead of a distinct laboratory.",1351248268

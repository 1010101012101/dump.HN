Are they not being used? Am I simply looking in the wrong places? Or is A/B testing really sufficient in most cases?</i><p>I believe part of the problem is you actually know the definition of
""A/B Testing"" and the real definition (testing a single, specific
change) is mostly lost on the majority of those using the phrase. In
other words, ""A/B Testing"" in common use has essentially become slang
for ""Multi-Variate Testing"" and other forms of testing.<p>For example, if you only change the color of a button, you're (formally)
doing ""A/B Testing"" but if you change both the color and location of a
button, you're (formally) doing ""Multi-Variate Testing."" None the less,
you'll often see the later called the former in common usage.",1323727179

Currently it is a 'manual' system, ie Excel.<p>Apparently, it is popular with the clients they show it too, but they can't really increase the sales volume without some help.<p>They would like to convert it to an web app, which the clients will access. I don't know if any reason that it can't work on a technical level.<p>The proposal they offered is to give me 25% of the business, in exchange for developing the online bit of the system.<p>In essence I am keen to go for this opportunity.<p>I need to come up with a list of questions or items to be written into a contract, before we have a telephone interview, and wondered if any one here has been through anything similar.<p>My initial questions are:
- If the business is sold, will I get 25% of the sale price
- Does my 25% mean 25% of sales or profit
- What guarantees are there that the guy doing the sales will work hard at it
- Who/how are decisions made, do we all need to agree
- Should the software exist only on my server
- What costs can be off set against the company 
- Can I claim extra costs for hosting on my server
- I'm concerned that after months of development they may decide to cancel the project because of other commitments (We all have other work going on)<p>Does any one have a good contract for this sort of arrangement? Is there a correct term for this?<p>I am operating through a Limited company in the UK.",1323727133

Our exploratory quest and adventure will remain ever more interesting and baffling when we start to probe in higher energy levels.

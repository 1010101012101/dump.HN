I would think that rich people would be harder to advertise to. If you're in the top 1%, you spend your time around the people you take cues from -- if the New York Times says one thing is cool, and Trey Wellborne the Nth says another, you're going to emulate Trey.<p><i>That's why poor people are largely illiterate and uneducated today, whereas only fifty years ago it was the working class that drove the progressive movement.</i><p>A more sensible hypothesis is that our economy is better at using smart people than it was fifty years ago. For one thing, fifty years ago, half of the smartest 50% were restricted to working as housewives and secretaries. There are now many more jobs for which a high IQ leads to higher pay -- so the problem isn't that the poor were under-stimulated and thus became dumb; it's that the smart, regardless of stimulation level, didn't stay poor.",1226033524

Whether they like it or not, whether it's moral or not, they're in direct competition with people just downloading the full def episodes from bit torrent. Just do more product placement and get it over with (apparently the last Pierce Brosnan Bond film was paid for entirely by product placement - the box office revenue was pure profit). It reminds me very much of Starforce, the ridiculous, OS destroying DRM solution for Windows games. It happily fucked up the machines running legit copies and the cracked versions of the game just totally disabled it.",1178776819

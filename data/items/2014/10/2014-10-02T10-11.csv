So basically same dim image looks  different than same bright image. Geometry often also changed when brightnes was changed. It&#x27;s complex thing to receate authentic CRT.<p>Also many emulations fail with phosphor decay in very obvious ways. So it&#x27;s not being done in a correctly at all. This cathode project is good, but many of these are clearly done by people, who haven&#x27;t ever used the authentic thing and do not know what it should be like.<p>I remember that I laughed when people were talking about 25 ms TFT being slow. From good green / amber display you could still read text after 5 seconds since powering it off. ;)<p>I had one of these, lovely. <a href=""http://sales.hansotten.nl/uploads/msx/monitoren/IMG_6798.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sales.hansotten.nl/uploads/msx/monitoren/IMG_6798.JPG</a> And this beauty is pretty modern one, because it&#x27;s color display. With many older CRTs you had to use 40 chars per line, because image was so fuzzy that 80x25 would have been unreadable.<p>About noise, I have seen some extremely cheap and old VGA adapters generate so much noise and timing jitter into signal, that it looks like old TV even with modern dispalys.

8400196,comment,8399791,8400091,2,0,justinsb,,,"I do think it would be interesting to implement a Make -> Ninja compiler; the devil is in extracting all the correct dependencies.<p>But... it sounds like the OP isn&#x27;t really concerned about CPU efficiency (CPU is cheap compared to all the other resources they&#x27;re considering).  I wonder if it would therefore be possible to convert a _single_ make execution to ninja (perhaps by instrumenting make).  Then, each build would entail running the converted ninja file, while simultaneously re-running the make->ninja conversion.  If the make->ninja conversion produces a different execution plan, throw away the ninja build and start again.<p>This is based on my guess that the build execution changes comparatively rarely: new files or header includes are much rarer than &#x27;simple&#x27; code changes.<p>Edit: I think ninja is also smart enough to know when an artifact has been built using a different command / dependency, so even the &#x27;cache miss&#x27; case where we restart the ninja build should be fast.",1412247550

8400190,comment,8399789,8400133,2,0,Udo,,,"<i>> FSMs. They cannot be implemented more naturally and efficiently with anything else.</i><p>It depends a bit on what your motivation for using a Lua interpreter embedded into the .NET environment is. Instinctively, it wouldn&#x27;t be my choice for things that need to be exceedingly fast. But let&#x27;s say you do want to implement an FSM in this context where performance isn&#x27;t critical. States and state transitions could very well be expressed by functions instead of code blocks, and there are implementations in the wild that do this.<p><i>> Huge switch can be costly.</i><p>Goto doesn&#x27;t really help alleviate the cost of chaining if statements either (which is what Lua forces you to do in the absence of a switch statement). But if it&#x27;s critical, you could build dispatch tables with pure Lua tables to mirror a static switch statement.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned about processor cache though, I don&#x27;t think interpreted Lua on top of .NET is the right choice to base an FSM of to begin with.<p><i>> DSLs may need goto to represent features not directly available in the host language structural elements</i><p>True, but it depends a bit on the paradigms chosen to implement the necessary transformations. It&#x27;s correct though that goto statements provide you with a very intuitive way to shape control flow in the absence of corresponding features in the host language. If that facility is missing, you lose the option of translating your canonical C-based algorithms faithfully into Lua code. Whether that&#x27;s a bad thing is a matter of debate.<p>For me it comes down to the consideration of using the right tool for the appropriate job, which was the context of my original comment. If you&#x27;re building a language that needs to satisfy every possible use case efficiently (both in respect to execution and programmer effort), you&#x27;re just screwed. This is especially true for interpreted languages, and extraordinarily so if they&#x27;re supposed to host higher level interpreted languages on top.",1412247327

If it can&#x27;t then the expected conversion rate is the same whether or not we execute one more step. Lets assume without loss of generality that option 2 is currently winning, but if option 1 gets another conversion then 1 is winning.

I <i>want</i> to print more, but I don&#x27;t, because CUPS is a kludge, and I don&#x27;t feel like using Windows at work for the sole purpose of somewhat sane printer handling.<p>Now to answer why and what I would want to print more? Surprisingly, I mostly want to print code. The reason is that computers suck for reading and thinking, and in my specific case, I can&#x27;t focus on thinking hard in front of a computer screen (it&#x27;s too easy to turn on HN).<p>When I&#x27;m stuck with a hard refactor to do, I like to print out all relevant files, take coloured pens and highlighters and keep drawing and annotating code until everything is clear in my hand. Paper is simply superior in annotating capabilities and high-level view (i.e. spread 20 pages in front of you to see everything). I haven&#x27;t found any tool yet that would make doing this on computer even comparable.<p>I once asked a very known HN user, who prints out all relevant code every afternoon as a method of planning work for the next day, whether he worries about the amount of paper he uses. The answer I got: &quot;Paper is cheap. Focus is golden.&quot;<p>As for ecology side of printing, I used to worry much more about it before. But at some point I realized that I didn&#x27;t do any math, and from what I can tell, &quot;paperless world&quot; seems to be much more damaging to environment than cutting down trees for paper, and as long as we recycle, paper ain&#x27;t that bad.

8400159,comment,8394136,8399793,1,0,pluma,,,"It could have been a single Euro and it would still be outrageous. I&#x27;m not aware of any country that did <i>not</i> raise the fees after introducing them. In fact, universities in Germany were generally free to set the fees as low as they want and nearly every single one of them set them to the maximum allowed by the bill.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of principles. Introducing tuition fees at all means you&#x27;re abandoning the idea of universities being open to everyone. Sure, you can subsidize those unable to afford the fees, but by adding such hurdles you effectively raise the barrier to entry.<p>And the claim that this would bring extra money is pretty naive. The idea was to shift the burden of maintaining universities from the general public (via taxes) to the students (via tuition fees) in order to be able to lower (or avoid raising) the public subsidies. It would have allowed the government to reduce the subsidies arbitrarily because the universities could still make up for the difference by raising the tuition fees.<p>Thinking that the money was needed is also pretty naive. The bill required universities to spend the money on improving the quality of education (e.g. more student tutors, better equipment, etc). The university I studied at spent the money on new buildings, including one purely administrative building that replaced the only major car park available to students in the vicinity of the main campus. But the vast majority of the money was never spent -- they only started shoving money into these building projects because they were threatened with being sued over keeping the money in the bank (to attract interest).<p>Oh, and at my university at least (University of Cologne), the invoices students received were accompanied by free advertising for the NRW.Bank (effectively a government-owned private company), offering a &quot;special&quot; loan with a slightly lower interest than other banks. The process for signing up was also very streamlined: they&#x27;d pay the tuition fees for you, you just pay the regular baseline fee (~280 EUR back then) as before and you could pretend the tuition fees don&#x27;t exist until you&#x27;ve graduated and need to pay the loan (and accumulated interest) back. Very thoughtful of them, but also very devious.<p>It also didn&#x27;t help that our principal tried to dispel the protesters by saying that every student could afford the tuition if only they drank one less beer per day.<p>But the primary reason student organizations found the tuition fees so appalling is the trend happening at the time: the switch to the BA/MA system, the reduction of high school from 13 to 12 years, the &quot;Eliteuniversität&quot; programme (which incentivised further shifting money from niche subjects to the more attractive ones (basically anything likely to receive outside funding from major corporations)) and the general &quot;Verschulung&quot; of higher education to make university degrees more useful for HR and less about real education or science, effectively turning universities into US-style diploma mills.<p>The original German ideal of university (compared to the more business-oriented Fachhochschule and the traditional IHK job training system or the craft Geselle/Meister systems) is the <i>studium generale</i> or <i>studium universale</i>. In other words: the renaissance man approach to science, striving to become a polymath by educating yourself to achieve wisdom and become a more informed citizen. That education should be open and available to all who seek it out.<p>The origin of this ideal is generally ascribed to Humboldt. The general trend of adapting the more &quot;open&quot; university system to the &quot;needs of the economy&quot; (this was a major selling point for the BA/MA switch back then) and thus further blurring the distinction between university and other forms of (job-related) higher education stands directly opposed to this ideal. Whether you think this ideal has any worth or not (or even whether it is remotely realistic or not), it was a major source of conflict during the protests.",1412246493

If I visited a doctor and she said, &quot;You&#x27;re running a fever, and your blood has cooties,&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t think of that as the height of medical expertise, and it&#x27;s certainly not science.<p>GPs will tell you that this is wha they say to most patients.  Why do you think antibiotics were overprescribed by so much for so long? To treat cooties.  Plenty of illnesses have weakly defined causes but are treated anyway. Your refusal to subject physical health treatments to the same level of rigour that you subject mental health treatments is one sign of your kookery on this subject.<p>>  therapy is indistinguishable from the placebo<p>This is nonsense.  Perhaps you&#x27;re confused?  We know that &quot;counseling&quot; doesn&#x27;t work.  But no one credible suggests counseling as treatment, they suggest things like CBT. Here&#x27;s a meta-meta-analysis.  Given the evidence for CBT is so strong and the evidence for counseling is so weak it&#x27;s telling that you recommend &quot;chat&#x27;s with your aunt&quot; as being an effective treatment - totally misreading the literature.<p><a href=""http://stantatkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CogBehav-Therapy-Butler06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stantatkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CogBehav-Th...</a><p>> This review summarizes the current meta-analysis literature on treatment outcomes of CBT for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. A search of the literature resulted in a total of 16 methodologically rigorous meta-analyses. Our review focuses on effect sizes that contrast outcomes for CBT with outcomes for various control groups for each disorder, which provides an overview of the effectiveness of cognitive therapy as quantified by meta-analysis. Large effect sizes were found for CBT for unipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and childhood depressive and anxiety disorders. Effect sizes for CBT of marital distress, anger, childhood somatic disorders, and chronic pain were in the moderate range. CBT was somewhat superior to antidepressants in the treatment of adult depression. CBT was equally effective as behavior therapy in the treatment of adult depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Large uncontrolled effect sizes were found for bulimia nervosa and schizophrenia. The 16 meta-analyses we reviewed support the efficacy of CBT for many disorders. While limitations of the meta-analytic approach need to be considered in interpreting the results of this review, our findings are consistent with other review methodologies that also provide support for the efficacy CBT. D 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.<p>It should be obvious why you don&#x27;t see placebo controlled studies for CBT - it is unethical to provide patients no therapy and so it&#x27;s hard to get studies approved and it&#x27;s hard to creat a sham talking therapy that would blind the patient and therapist.<p>> and existing medications have a terrible reputation<p>Medication is not recommended as front line treatment anymore.  Medications for any illness can be unpleasant.  I&#x27;m not convinced that anti depressants are any worse than any other medication. Comparing anti-depressants with placebo shows similar rates of drop-out.",1412246062

It cannot be used to comment on it at all.<p>Your clothes analogy is a straw man. People conspire all the time. There are many, many instances of people conspiring. There are many instances of conspiracy theories thought to be rubbish that turned out to be true. Watergate, anyone? Or more recently, if you had suggested that the NSA had tapped every major network in the world and created viruses that burrow down into the chips themselves and so on, you&#x27;d have been called a conspiracy theorist. Then came Edward Snowden.<p>Yes, covering with pebbles doesn&#x27;t provide any evidence for a conspiracy theory. But equally your argument provides no refutation that it&#x27;s a conspiracy.<p>Science however can offer concrete facts. For example: laboratory tests on debris recovered illegally from Estonia&#x27;s bow yielded trace evidence of an explosion.<p>So how do you review that? By performing independent tests on other salvaged material. Which could be quite simple to do, if it wasn&#x27;t covered in stones. Just think, if it wasn&#x27;t covered in stones, you could recover some of the wreck, test it and show that there is no trace evidence of any explosions.<p>Now that we only have that trace evidence, I suppose we just have to be content with the idea that it was sunk with an explosion. Unless you have some kind of evidence that refutes it?<p>You may think the reverse, that this evidence cant be trusted, and that the official line should be trusted. But you would be wrong. That is unscientific. You would have to prove that the work done by Jutta Rabe is false by doing your own lab work and making your own observations.<p>Interesting how the pebbles stop all further investigation, isn&#x27;t it? But I know, I know. Governments would never do that. They are so trustworthy. They never lie. etc. etc.<p>Good luck with your understanding of geopolitics, clothes and carpentry...",1412244417

A scan of the diff doesn&#x27;t reveal anything particularly interesting being done in Javascript that Coffeescript would get in the way of. It&#x27;s fine to argue that Coffeescript gets in your way and prevents you from doing things that you couldn&#x27;t do otherwise, but at least demonstrate examples to that effect.<p>Even more perplexingly, there are methods like `merge` in examples.coffee/js which, in the Javascript version, are effectively compiled Coffeescript, and which are less concise than they should be; why does the Javascript version call `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)` when arguments is never treated as an array outside of length and subscripting, both of which the arguments object already supports? Coffeescript does it specifically so that using arguments as an array is transparent to the user. Why is it necessary in the Javascript version, when the only effect is the creation of an additional object?<p>It&#x27;s somewhat silly to argue for Javascript on the basis of it offering finer control over the code, and then not using that control. If you just don&#x27;t like Coffeescript, fine, but let that be your argument.",1412244295

I do agree that the iPhone deserve a place in the history books because it did change the landscape significantly. But my point was that the iPhone wasn&#x27;t the first phone of it&#x27;s ilk (probably the best all rounder  and definitely best at specific criteria, but those are point I&#x27;m enjoying discussing here). In light of that, if the iPhone deserves a place then equally the handsets that pioneered much of the technology and paradigms which Apple beautifully combined, those other handsets deserves a mention too (like how scientific papers based on original research still need to draw from the pool of existing research and thus even new theories owe credit other publications)",1412244194

With his feet, he can use mice and controllers.  But multi-touch systems are beyond his ability - while he can pivot and shift to type remarkably quickly, he can't get more than one hand on something at the same time.  Worse, each hand is effectively only one digit for him.<p>And then, there are the folks who don't even have his degree of dexterity.<p>I can't help thinking that it might be a good thing for general interface designers to consider the implications of disabilities for users of these designs, instead of shrugging that off onto providers of interfaces specifically for the disabled.",1255384786

But even the newest user is going to be using the keyboard and the more experienced a user gets, the more they use the keyboard. And even more, as computers become <i>a normal part of human society</i>, interfaces <i>pandering to novices</i> will become less important, not more important. The question will change, is changing now, from ""how do I use this thing?"" to ""How can I be more productive with this thing""?<p>Conside that MOST of the data that users input is going to be text, which a form of <i>discreet</i> digital data. A mouse or manipulative multitouch interface, no matter how well designed, is useless for this because it inherently produces analog input which is then translated to a digit action - dragging a file to the trash versus  just pressing the delete key.<p>Photo editing or moving windows are exceptional cases but UI designers are constantly developing clever ways to do them specifically because they allow all sorts of kinesthetic analogs.

If you're offering him more than he currently earns, you're already paying more than market rates. And you want to add ownership in the company?<p>You (and him) seem more concerned about issues of face than issues of compensation. This is dangerous. Quantify the value of your business and the value he brings. If you're not sure how much value he brings (emotional support? you're kidding me!), don't give equity. Come up with a plan to evaluate things in six months, or make a commitment that require hitting aggressive performance targets that are linked explicitly to his work. And make sure things vest.<p>One approach might be giving him the option to purchase up to a certain percentage of the company at a set value. Then figure out the value by asking yourself a simple question: if you had to sell the whole company, how much would you want for it? If he really cares about ownership he can purchase equity out of his salary over time. If he doesn't want to invest that is a warning sign he won't be contributing to growth.<p>And ultimately, remember that friendship and business is hard to mix. You will have a working relationship with him. He could easily come to resent working for you for ""so little"" at the same time you may come to resent giving him ""such a good deal"".

Most people will tell you this is a bad idea, and it probably is. I got a check up right before I quit my job. This was the first time I had been to a doctor since I was a little kid, so I wasn't too worried at the time.<p>Second: I finally decided to get an HSA (Health Savings Account). This covers you in case of a disaster. It's a high deductible plan where you save money to pay for health expenses. For a non-smoker in 20's, the cost was roughly $60 a month, and you could sock away a few thousand a year (forget the exact number) for health expenses. I think the exact maximum has changed somewhat. You aren't taxed on that money for the year, and if nothing happens, you just get to withdraw it when you are in your 60's. I thought it was a pretty good deal in that I was willing to cover smaller medical bills out of pocket, rarely go to the doctor, and it seems to have the benefits of a retirement account (like a Roth IRA + Traditional IRA).<p>Third: Last year I got married.

The sweet spot of a fast, compiled, dynamic language and tools built to leverage those strengths gives Apple a lot of flexibility and productivity in design and implementation, from the OS level to the GUI tool kit level.  I think that where Microsoft increasingly found themselves pushing a ball of mud uphill with the Windows code base, Apple was able to do a lot of clever things with their software stack without changing the underlying design and architecture.  Like porting their PC OS to a cell phone and allowing their developers to leverage much of their existing skills to make apps for it.<p>During Jobs' Nexodus, the NextStep environment became the main product because it was such a productive way to build software.

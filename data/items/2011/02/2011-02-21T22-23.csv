Doing it this way (making everything private, but giving you simple methods for creating getters and setters) gives you the best of both worlds: Encapsulation and simple and concise code. attr_accessor simply creates the boilerplate code you would write yourself or use an IDE for in other languages. If you want to change a getter, just write a new method with the name of the variable and do whatever you want. This makes it easy to change your class logic later, but won't fill your classes with generic getter/setter code.",1298329131

Whenever they tow abandoned cars, he charges a daily rate. If no one steps forward to pay the bill, at some point he can get the title for the car and own it. You would think people would claim their cars, but in a lot of situations there is evidence in the car (drugs, guns, etc) that the police take and then he ends up with a car on his lot nobody wants to claim. Six months later, he forecloses on it and ends up owning a car.

The technique requires carving out around twenty minutes for meditation twice a day (morning and evening). Even with a schedule as flexible as mine (i.e., <i>extremely</i> flexible), I found this virtually impossible to maintain; forty minutes a day may not sound like much, but it is, especially since it has to happen at specific times (before meals, not before bed, etc.). For example, I work much better if I eat within 30 minutes of waking; since (according to NSR) you're not supposed to eat before meditating, that leaves almost no slack in my morning schedule.  It's also incredibly easy to forget to meditate until an hour before you have to be somewhere, and then you have to (say) shower, dress, eat, <i>and</i> meditate in order to keep up with the program. (Actually, per the eating rule, you would have to meditate and then shower & eat. And possibly be late to your thing.) And you know how hackers operate on the Maker's Schedule? For me, meditation became one of those things that breaks big chunks of time in two. Not good.<p>NSR emphasizes the importance of doing two sessions <i>every day</i>. After a couple of weeks on the program, I found that the stress of scheduling the meditation, combined with the stress of missing the occasional session (and hence, horror of horrors, <i>not following the program</i>), completely overwhelmed any stress-relieving benefits from the practice. I abandoned it within a month.<p>I'm not sharing this experience to show how much meditation sucks; I'm inclined to believe those who say meditation works wonders for them. I'd appreciate some advice from those who have faced and overcome the problems I've described—if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.",1298328470

As a nation we're under the thumb of the insurance companies, and instead of doing anything serious about it, we've done almost the worst possible option: require every one of us to be a customer of these monstrous companies, with little regulation on cost or other government oversight.  I'm the first person to back health insurance reform, but we've reformed it in the name of shoveling more money into the pockets of industry instead of for regular people needing real care.<p>It's crap like this that's compelling me to make my current expat lifestyle permanent.  America might still get the tax dollars my business generates (the only country to still tax you if you live abroad) but it won't get my brain or my talent within its borders.",1298328192

I remember learning BASIC before I had a computer of my own. I would write programs at home, then type them up at school on a BBC Micro.<p>I remember using the back of the manual for my friend's ZX Spectrum to learn how to write machine code (effectively in the form of poking bytes directly read from DATA statements, then saving the code out to tape). I wrote a tool to dump out the bytes from code I loaded - in effect using it as a disassembler. I actually cracked the Elite loader for Scooby Doo this way and found hidden messages in there.<p>Later my parents finally caved in and got me a Multiface 1 after I had my own spectrum, and I started cracking games, writing pokes for kids at school.<p>I eventually moved to an Amiga and picked up AMOS as I hated GW-BASIC. It was there I first tried Emacs, but preferred MicroEmacs. I learned enough 68k assembler to crack a few games using a friend's borrowed Action Replay but never had my own so didn't get enough time with it to do much. I wrote a few demos for the Amiga, but they weren't widely released (with me living in rural England with no direct BBS access anymore it wasn't like I could upload a DMS file somewhere), although some went around the local schools, colleges and towns.<p>I also wrote games for the Archimedes and Amiga. When I got a PC I started writing for that too. Eventually I got an Internet connection of my own. I hated the PC, wanted my miggy back but Commodore was long gone and this was the future. I eventually installed this new fangled Linux thing and it came with free compilers - sweet! Over the space of a few weeks I learnt how syscalls worked, how memory management worked and eventually started writing shellcode, then exploit code and tools. After I got married I started dropping off a bit, but I'm amazed at how many languages I can program in (I have no idea how many, but it's a lot), not including the dead ones.<p>So my general way of learning was reverse engineering the language (because I generally lacked documentation) but slowly became more along the lines of reading books, tutorials, and picking things up as I got access to the Internet.",1298326404

The RAM is just a cache, and if you configure store with 'cache-flush-delay 60' you are telling Redis that at max in 60 seconds every given key that is dirty should be flushed on disk.<p>If there are many writes it is easy to hit the I/O write speed limit, and the system starts to be I/O bound.<p>So diskstore is surely a solution when there is a big data problem where writes are rare compared to reads. If writes are really a lot, there is to consider the total I/O.<p>The ideal solution in your scenario is IMHO to take data about the latest N hours in an in-memory Redis instance. And move the historical data into a diskstore-enabled instance. This way you have a full win, as the diskstore instance will be used <i>only</i> for reads, so will provide the maximum benefits. While the in-memory instance will have the usual predictable and low latency characteristic of the usual default Redis configuration.",1298326327

I'm really excited my post made it to Hacker News, and am glad to discuss it.<p>Personally, I'm interested in ways to avoid the systemic problem next time around. But people here might benefit more from ways to distinguish the useful bits of Agile methods from the sea of bullshit, and how to defend against the latter",1298325674

I've had great success with shaking things up when my rough patch was directly due to stagnation.<p>Of course, I'm not talking about going CRAZY and committing a few felonies or anything. Just things like moving, selling my motorcycle and buying a different one, even simply culling my wardrobe or collection of miscellaneous stuff.

He's not talking about `unwind-protect', which he hasn't even used in his example (that would be the equivalent of `try' ... `finally').  He's talking about the fact that in Lisp, you can make a single abstraction that encapulates the entire pattern of opening the file before doing something and closing it afterwards.  This is not that common a language feature, though it is catching on.  Python's `with' was introduced in 2.5, which came out a few months after his post was written.  Scala's ""automatic closures"" (I would say ""automatic lambdas"") show another way to provide this functionality, more general than Python's `with'; I think the blogger can be forgiven for not having heard of Scala in 2006.  Java has no elegant way to do this.",1298325614

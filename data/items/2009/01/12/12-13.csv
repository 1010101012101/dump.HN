If I could work 3 weeks a year and make enough to pay for rent and food for the other 49 I wouldn't care too much about money either.",1231764807

430407,comment,428785,429080,0,0,cmac,,,"This is an interesting example but I think it's not very really helpful in understanding Libertarianism.<p>First let me answer your question directly: in this example, Libland is undoubtedly screwed because Xia has a monopoly on the food supply. The people of Libland would not be able to cope with this situation and they'd most likely be overrun. Sure, there will be pockets or resistance with guerrillas doggedly fighting on for years or decades, but as a state, Libland would no longer exist.<p>Nevertheless, I think that the example isn't helpful because of two positions:<p>1) The unexplained reason why Xia can produce food so cheaply.\n2) That it would be uneconomical for anyone other than Xia to produce food.<p>In the real-world, there would be a competitor for Xia to supply food. Even if Xia started off as the only supplier, someone would realise that they could enter the market supplying food that's a little cheaper, higher quality or just a little more different. The people of Libland, knowing the dangers of relying on only one source, would then also start purchasing from the competitor _in_addition_ to Xia.<p>I therefore think that your hypothetical scenario wouldn't exist outside of the 'thought laboratory'.",1231763312

The questions are either just a link to the app in question, or an explanatory post containing the URL which we are supposed to copy/paste to visit it.<p>Am I the only one wishing that I could just click the link in the latter type of questions? I understand why the restriction is in place, to prevent spam/abuse/etc, it's even in the FAQ. However, if the question is legitimate and gets upvoted, why not just show the link after a certain number of upvotes?<p>Do I make any sense?",1231762740

430401,comment,429477,429477,0,0,chris_l,,,"For conventional programming I've been working on laying the logic out as a graph automatically. Instead of cryptic formulas in the cells, you would have an easy to understand graph that shows how information is related and computed. In addition the intermediate results for selected input values could be shown next to the nodes and links, to allow inspection of the computation.<p>This could be adapted for the spreadsheet concept. Actually, it might be more appropriate there.",1231762526

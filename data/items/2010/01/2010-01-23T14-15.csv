1071871,comment,1071768,1071768,0,0,gexla,,,"If you are a web developer, then the communities geared for the tools you use are probably a good place to look.  For example, if you are primarily a Wordpress developer then there's lots of Wordpress communities.  I'm sure the same goes for whatever your industry your business fits into.<p>The biggest names in my circle of work tend to post very little at these communities, probably because they are crazy busy.  I find the most active participants are either new or hobbyists.<p>Edit:  Perhaps another way to reach out to other big names in your industry is to create ""stuff"" which can capture their attention.  That might be writing code which they might try out or posting info to a weblog which they might read.  That's a great way to get your name out there.  Conferences are probably another good way.<p>So, I think you need to dig deeper than web communities.",1264258746

I can't really think of any, and if there are not then persons in power are either divided into the two groups, or all persons in power belong to one of the groups. I think it is highly unlikely that all persons in power would belong to the same group, but perhaps some condition for reaching a position of power prevents you from belonging to one of the groups.<p>I don't have any answers, but found it too interesting not say anything.",1264258630

1071862,comment,1071456,1071456,0,0,sounddust,,,"I think they should give the premium features to those of us who pre-ordered, for free, permanently.<p>It wouldn't cost them anything extra to do so (maybe a few dollars/year in server costs for the entire pre-order userbase).  Sure, they will lose potential subscriber costs for some pre-order customers, but if they can't sell enough WakeMates to make the pre-order crowd an insignificant blip, then they are not going to be able to succeed anyway.  Furthermore, the pre-order crowd is the group you really, really want to be happy.  They are going to be the first to give their impressions to the world, and those tweets/reviews/blog posts are going to be at the top of Google's search results for near-infinity.<p>I feel like a pre-order was a commitment to Wakemate, and they are not honoring their side in expecting us to pay more to fully utilize the product.  They can say that the premium model has features in addition to what was initially planned, but I think that anyone who planned to buy the product expected the free service to improve and add features over time anyway, so it seems that effort is instead being redirected to the premium version.",1264258125
1071861,comment,1071456,1071575,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"""Sorry everyone, we really fucked this one up! Chalk it up to a massive learning experience for our entire company. This being our first mass email, we didn't phrase anything well enough, we didn't check it thoroughly enough, and we didn't properly communicate our business model and what people are really paying for. Like I said, we fucked this one up.<p>Here's the deal- the hardware delays are due to us finding some very cool improvements that increase the accuracy of the device 50% and reduce power consumption significantly. Since this is a hardware product, we don't want our first users stuck with a shitty revision that's significantly worse than a version we ship in three months. To do this only takes a one month delay, and the logistics of shipping two versions, one for people who want the 'old' version now and one for people who want the 'new' version in a month just wouldn't work. There's only three of us, so we have to make some gut decisions.<p>However, we didn't communicate the premium features well at all- we haven't even begun working on them yet! They have nothing to do with the delay, and, though very cool, they don't affect the core functionality of the product- helping you wake up more refreshed every single morning. This is more for folks who love geeky graphs like us :) We'll be charging something trivial like $3.99/month, but felt it would be a nice token of appreciation to people who had to have their product delayed.<p>Again, my apologies for all of this- we'll definitely improve how we communicate with our customers starting immediately. And, if anyone has any questions, here's my email so you can get ahold of me directly : [ceo's email here].""",1264258116

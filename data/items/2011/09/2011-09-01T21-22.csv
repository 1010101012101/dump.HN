2951826,comment,2951347,2951347,5,0,alex1,,,"I didn't see any mention of songwriting royalties, which can be very significant if they also write their own music.<p>The songwriter/composer of a song (not a recording of a song, but the actual melody, lyrics) gets a performance royalty each time a song is played in ""public"" (internet and broadcast radio, in the elevator, at a bar, etc). This is the royalty BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC collect. If the song is recorded and sold by someone, the songwriter gets mechanical royalties for each unit sold. If memory serves me correctly, the compulsory rate right now is 8 cents per unit sold. If the song in any form (recorded, sung by a drunk dude, etc) is used in something like a movie or a TV show, the songwriter gets a synchronization royalty. I've seen sync royalties range from $5,000 to $250,000. Songwriters are usually signed to publishing companies. Publishing companies are mostly owned by record labels themselves (or their parent companies). Publishing companies take a cut of the songwriters' royalties, but not as big as the cut record labels take from recording artists. I've seen rates ranging from 10% to 30%.<p>On the other hand, the recording artist gets pretty much whatever the record label decides to give them as described  in the recording contract. The label will own the song recordings, not the artist. Recording artists (and record labels) do <i>not</i> get any royalties for public performance. Yes, when a song is played on FM radio, the record label doesn't get a penny. The <i>only</i> exception to this is when the song is played on ""interactive"" services on the Internet. This is the royalty Sound Exchange collects. In those cases, both the songwriter and whoever owns the copyright to the sound recording (the record label) get royalties. The main sources of revenue for the label are from these royalties, and from selling the sound recording in stores and online. They take a large chunk (60-70%) of this and distribute the rest to the song's recording artist, producer, etc.",1314912137

Ocaml and Haskell seemed ugly (to me) at one time, and now I love those languages. Lisp and its parentheses? You get used to it after 2 weeks, but some people hate it at first. The sign of an aesthetically defective language is that it stays ugly even after you get a hang of it.<p>Scala may be The Compromise That We Have To Make. In the functional programming (i.e. good languages) community, we're so passionate about languages that we become factional, divided between Ocaml and Haskell and Clojure and Erlang and F#. What comes out of this is that we divide ourselves up into 1-2% silos and end up having to use Java, because people who don't care about PL got behind a small set of languages a long time ago.<p>I don't know Scala very well and may end up eating my words here, but I think it (or F#) may be the language we need to Get Behind, at least for now.<p>Scala is statically typed and can take advantage of the JVM libraries.

Right now, we enable users to create a damn good resume with Resunate (resunate.com).<p>We code in Ruby on Rails and jQuery. We expect you to have a very strong foundation in programming and several projects behind you in developing web software. You should be someone who hates bugs to be found in your code, so you test it like crazy before deploying it. You are disciplined in development and can contribute in our transition to a more disciplined development culture. You like working with a designer to help style your features, and have a good eye for usability and aesthetics. You like to take skeletal user stories and flesh out the solution space. You think in graphs and algorithms, and are not afraid of complexity. You are bubbling with feature ideas.<p>There are a couple of major projects you will be working on with the team in the near future:<p>a) Developing an API for other apps to easily communicate with us 
b) Developing analytical tools for career centers 
c) Developing a utility for jobseekers to discover skills to improve 
d) Develop mechanisms to improve our matching engine
e) Develop interesting social features that leverage social network APIs<p>We work in a designer space in Uptown Pittsburgh (between downtown and Oakland, across from South Side), which is co-inhabited by a giant poodle and other interesting tech companies. We like being co-located while working, and expect the same of you.<p>Friday afternoons you work on whatever you feel like. Seriously. We brew freshly ground single origin coffee at least twice a day. We will pay you comparable salary to companies our size, pay for half your health and dental insurance, and may provide you stock options.<p>Interested? Contact us at careers@careerimp.com<p>Note: This is a full-time position (40+ hrs/wk). Part-time contractors need not apply.",1314911631

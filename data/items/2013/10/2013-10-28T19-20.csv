6629367,comment,6629298,6629298,6,0,quadrangle,,,"Capitalism is itself based on constant growth. There is a fundamental misunderstanding with this article (and most of our society) and that is the conflation of capitalism and a free market. A truly free market is not necessarily capitalist, and actually capitalism doesn&#x27;t lead to free markets. This confusion is messing up everyone&#x27;s thoughts. What we like is the free market, the natural bottom-up interactions that help determine prices and such. Free markets have nice features.<p>Capitalism is about profit and growth and the instant you think it isn&#x27;t going to fail, everyone might as well speculate like crazy (why not? if it isn&#x27;t going to fail). The only way for capitalism to work is for everyone to realize that it is inherently unstable and likely to fail. And that realization is true also.<p>We can still advocate for market freedom without advocating capitalism.",1382990367

6629354,comment,6626941,6628924,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> HN participants still continually demand profit be the most important metric.<p>That may or may not be true, but nothing in my comment suggested this was the case. In fact, if you argued that the price-to-earnings ratio was the most meaningful metric for investment and trading decisions, my response would be the same: it can be very useful, but alone it can get you into a lot of trouble. Nobody experienced is investing/trading off of a P/E comparison that takes a fraction of a minute.<p>> Additionally, the medium price/sales ratio for the entire market has little to do with an ultra small subset of technology companies IPOing.<p>Trying to understand a subsection of the market without understanding the broader market is a recipe for disaster. This is especially true in today&#x27;s market.<p>For clarity:<p>1. There are companies that deserve premium valuations. Some of these are tech companies.<p>2. The Fed is driving the market today, so valuation is very, very difficult.<p>3. Folks who believe there are publicly-traded companies that haven&#x27;t been impacted by QE and that aren&#x27;t vulnerable to major moves in either direction based on changes in monetary policy are going to be hammered.<p>> Just consider the BCG growth matrix for a few hours, think about how companies work, then come back and suggest a better metric than price/sales. If you come up with something smarter than that, I will be really, really impressed.<p>I don&#x27;t completely ignore fundamentals but I trade primarily off technicals so I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not going to impress you. That said, I would offer the observation that anyone who looks at trendlines has probably made a lot more money with far less effort over the past several years than folks who are obsessed with fundamentals.",1382990178

No chance to move it; nobody has a rocket that can be ready in that timeframe, much less a vehicle to intercept and move the rock. And even if you could, it was such a small rock that it&#x27;s probably cheaper to let it hit and replace everything on the ground. For launch alone: F9 is $54M, Proton $72M, and SLS $1.5B (should it ever exist). There&#x27;s not much the Chelyabinsk could have hit that would cost as much as trying to stop it. Even pretty big rocks have to get lucky to cause much damage, as sparse as development is, but since you can&#x27;t tell where exactly they will hit until quite late, it may be better to move any sufficiently large Earth-interceptor to avoid the possibility of an unlucky hit.",1382990103

Bonus points for making your &quot;cache&quot; smaller, like implementing a LRU (or simpler) algorithm for the last several lookups rather than memoizing all one million results.<p>There&#x27;s also a devilish way of (ab)using IEEE float arithmetic rounding errors which I forget at this moment.<p>If your language or a library attached to it handles arbitrary bases, there&#x27;s a certain pattern to the last digit WRT multiples of 5 when expressing the number in base 5... so just to be a jerk you do the math for 3-mults in base 3, 5-mults in base 5, and your 0 to 100decimal counter in base 7 for the pure hell of it.

Since we&#x27;re building with concrete (in this hypothetical example) you&#x27;re looking at a lot of weight. That puts you in the 4 x 12 category of header, maybe two if you are doing a longer space. But that has an issue that concrete doesn&#x27;t adhere to wood (which is why they make forms out of it) and so now you&#x27;re looking at a more engineered beam that you can have concrete form around. Except that isn&#x27;t really very strong unless it is prestressed (which is what they do with the concrete under bridges and roadways, and for that you really want to pull some iron through it which you release after it solidifies (the iron trys to contract and it keeps pressure (aka stress) on the concrete). So now you are 3D printing part of the building, then pausing so that your ironworkers can set up some rebar for the door and window headers, and then you put that concrete in and they come back and trim those. (this looks better than the threaded rod through the concrete with nuts on both sides to add the compression.<p>My point is not that the problems are not addressable, they are, rather its that &quot;3D Printing&quot; and &quot;Homes&quot; isn&#x27;t a good fit yet given what we know.

6629239,comment,6628424,6628424,1,0,orokusaki,,,"I think the best questions are technical questions that give the employer insight into the scope of my skill set. For instance, my previous employer asked what &quot;idempotent&quot; meant. Prima facie, this might seem pedantic. But, if you think about it, &quot;idempotent&quot; is quite frequently used by people who work in REST APIs, which infers that I <i>probably</i> have been reading about REST APIs or HTTP concepts in general or at least people&#x27;s blogs about REST APIs, etc.<p>Next, he asked me what the first argument to a Django view was. This was a pretty basic question, but if I hadn&#x27;t known the answer, it would be instantly clear that I didn&#x27;t have actual experience in Django, and if I did have experience in Django, the question wouldn&#x27;t seem like trickery.<p>I like this sort of questioning, because it reminds me of the year I decided to homeschool (in high school). The tests were on the honor system of course (you could easily cheat without a teach sitting right there), so the tests&#x27; questions would be about intricate details in a large (30+ pages) text, that you couldn&#x27;t possibly know without reading every last line. You could try to find the piece of text for each question, but it was quicker to just read the whole text. Guess what. I read 100% of every text book I had (I would have cheated otherwise, and then missed things like The Walden, etc. :)",1382988828

6629191,comment,6628179,6628976,3,0,waps,,,"Maybe you can look at in hexadecimal. Let&#x27;s see. The proof for sum-of-numbers = divisibility by 3 goes as follows.<p><pre><code>  1 % 3 = 1
  10 % 3 = 1
  100 % 3 = 1
  ...
</code></pre>
since things congruent modulo 3 are either both divisable by 3 or neither we can do this (because 10 and 3 are relatively prime):<p><pre><code>  (a * 1000 + b * 100 + c * 10 + d) % 3 = (a + b + c + d) % 3
</code></pre>
Hmmm 16 and 3 are relatively prime as well, and:<p><pre><code>  16 % 3 = 1
  256 % 3 = 1
  4096 % 3 = 1
  ...
</code></pre>
Ergo the sum of hexadecimal digits follows the same rule in hexadecimal ! Hurray !<p>So :<p><pre><code>  def divby3(x):
    s = 0
    while x != 0:
      s += x & 15

    if s >= 16:

    return s in [0,3,6,9,12,15]

      s += x & 15
      x = x >> 4

Children of those parents with the wrong skin color who can&#x27;t afford the treatment will still be discriminated against, but there will be fewer of them then there would otherwise be, so they&#x27;d be even more isolated and unable to effect change.<p>If this cycle continues to a point where the cost of the treatment becomes zero, eventually <i>everybody</i> chooses to give their children the privileged skin color, and the disadvantaged group effectively disappears. Is that genocide? I dunno. But it&#x27;s definitely <i>something</i>.<p>These dilemmas have been common to disadvantaged groups throughout history -- see the struggles light-skinned black people in America have had with the morality of &quot;passing&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_%28racial_identity%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_%28racial_identity%29</a>), or the tensions that can emerge in Jewish families when a child marries a Gentile.

</code></pre>
All of them are vague, probablistic, unscientific, and mostly dependent on complicit human behavior. In other words, you select for one of these pseudo-&quot;traits&quot; (because there&#x27;s no hard, deterministic science to prove genetic origins for all of these, conclusively with 100% certainty), and then the best laid plans are destroyed when the human being confronts unforgiving realities beyond the womb.<p><pre><code>  --but, but, but chance! No guarantees in life! Blah, blah, blah...
</code></pre>
Don&#x27;t apply hard science to select for &quot;hope&quot;. Select for 5 fingers, sure. Whatever. At least you know you&#x27;re getting what you paid for.<p>But, for the love of god, don&#x27;t select for the &quot;let&#x27;s hope he stays out of jail&quot; gene. That&#x27;s a social, behavioral, circumstantial outcome, based on the decision making of the other human beings a person surrounds themselves with.<p>I take heavy issue with selecting for or against cancer genetics in particular. A lot of actual cancer outcomes rely on circumstances, environment and behavior. Beyond that, cancer is by-and-large a normal outcome for tissues that don&#x27;t fail for other reasons. Any organ or tissue that doesn&#x27;t get killed by something else, on a long-enough timeline, will be killed by cancer. Given that premise (the inevitability of cancer) it only makes so much sense to target &quot;cancer genes&quot; as a selection criteria.<p>Oh, and by the way, if you have any sort of problem with genetically modified foods, then you should take the exact same issue with genetically modified humans.<p>Monoculture induced by inbreeding, selective breeding and artificial selection is a killer that destroys at time-scales beyond individual generations. Just look at Chihuahuas and their propensity for asthma, or German Shepherds and their weird leg problems.<p>This is to say that any damage we do now, we won&#x27;t necessarily be alive, to feel or understand the ramifications of. If all of us collectively decide to choose the absence of an adaptation, and that adaptation becomes essential a century after the fad, say hello to blight, extinction and perhaps the collapse of human civilization. Keep in mind that the loss of civilization (modern human society, and it&#x27;s trappings of education, and scientific method) has the absolutely damning knock-on effect of being rendered into a scenario where it is no longer possible for humanity to &quot;undo&quot; it&#x27;s own ruin.<p>Why? Because when you place a human social group in a suspended state of &quot;less than grade-school quality&quot; education for more than a generation or two, you&#x27;ll find that on the other end, the group&#x27;s descendants live in a state of uneducated superstition, lacking disciplines that engage in true scientific rigor (which can be enormously expensive). No more 4 year university STEM fellowships in this barren apocalyptic wasteland. Think in terms of what has happened to Afghanistan, where several decades of war have produced a generation denied of modern society. Now, imagine that same population also suffering from genetic disorders, induced by a fashion trend no one remembers. Only nature will decide who lives in such a scenario. But wait, it gets worse, given tendencies for human xenophobia, what if genetic choices made now, produce a form of future &quot;racism&quot; among uneducated apocalyptic cultures which we can&#x27;t anticipate?<p>Okay, sure. This is the Michael Bay Extreme Nightmare Scenario.<p>But still, we&#x27;re toying with &quot;science&quot; that we don&#x27;t fully comprehend, and all the while, we seem to be approaching it with all the solemnity of a coked-up Fashion designer caterwauling across a runway during Fashion Week in NYC.<p>If you don&#x27;t find that dangerous (from a patently non-religious perspective)... well then...

I realise that argument is made against every new technology (especially medical), but making an active choice somehow makes me culpable and it would be harder to live with it.<p>Also, there&#x27;s the idea of what happens if this becomes universal. Since some traits seem universally desirable, all parents will choose to grant them. So if everyone is given the genes to be massively intelligent, is that a good thing?<p>Then there&#x27;s the quality of life argument, which makes me deeply uncomfortable. Essentially, choosing a fully-sighted embryo over a partially-sighted one implicitly says &quot;partially-sighted people are likely to have lower quality of life than fully-sighted ones&quot;, and that sounds wrong both ethically and practically.<p>This is a really difficult debate, though. Put in the hypothetical situation of having to choose, I guess I would end up choosing the best possible embryo, but I&#x27;d rather not have to make the choice to begin with.",1382986905

6629056,comment,6628627,6628627,22,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is pretty funny. I doubt its authenticity but confess that when I worked at Intel (a looooooooooong time ago) and Andy Grove suggested there would be an 8086 in every Toaster I thought he was nuts, because the minimum system was about 4 sq inches (I had one as a demo board Intel sold) and who would want a CPU in a toaster anyway? A timer and a heating element, how hard is that?<p>Flash forward to today when playing with an Electric Imp[1] and noting that you don&#x27;t need 4 sq inches, you don&#x27;t even need 1 sq inch and you can network the damn thing.<p>So it certainly becomes <i>feasible</i> to do this sort of thing but I&#x27;m unable to construct a non-targeted reason why it would be <i>worthwhile</i> to do it. Now if you said, &quot;A shipment of toasters headed for the US Embassy&quot; or something where there was some actionable intelligence to be gained by snooping the network, perhaps. but randomly? Not so much.<p>[1] <a href=""http://electricimp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electricimp.com</a>",1382986838

I&#x27;ve been working on the startup full time ever since and my team has been part time on top of their day jobs. It&#x27;s been 4 months and we&#x27;re in our 3rd incubator / accelerator program.<p>I can tell you finding part-time consulting gigs is just as distracting as having a full-time job. Figure out a way to pay  your bills and decrease living expenses for about 6 months.<p>I can also tell you that you shouldn&#x27;t try to do it alone. Find someone else on your team (or outside) that&#x27;s willing to go all in on the idea too.<p>Congrats on the win!",1382986804

It's really meant to be a day of fun, doing something intellectually challenging, that gosh isn't like your all the homework you have due the next week.<p>As quoted from their FAQ, ""While this is not quite a recruiting event, we will be accepting résumés, so feel free to bring one along!

358679,comment,358284,358568,0,0,lhorn,,,"prospero, I have been looking for C++ replacement for desktop programs non-stop for at least 5 years and found <i>nothing</i>. Rubies, lisps and pythons are great in a little dark corner of server-side development where everything is under your control, but for targeting thousands of varying desktops you just can't take that route since many additional variables come into play: size of downloads, performance, startup times, windows compatibility, etc etc etc. Plus, all VM-based languages suffer from so-so integration into native OS or/and excessive weight. You can write an IDE or an Excel replacement in them, sure, but most desktop software tends to be much smaller.<p>My last C++ project was a background daemon that would download your RSS feeds and do some fancy parsing. I wish I could show you how much memory Java prototype has eaten vs C++ version processing the same OPML file.<p>No, C++ is not ""essentially worthless"" without Boost. In fact I never use all of Boost: your build times becomes #1 conversation topic in the office when you do. It's better to cherry-pick a few important and lightweight pieces (like pointers, any, functional, etc). Don't forget about HUGE selection of plain C libraries too.<p>Whatever C++ has been used for is still being written and re-written in C++ as we speak. Newer languages and paradigms wiped out the giant Visual Basic army of developers (yes, this is what people used to code ""basecamps of the 90s"" in, but I don't see these languages threaten C++/C/Obj-C domination for desktop software on Win/Linux/OSX.<p>In fact, how many native Python or Ruby GUI libraries are out there?

Look, if a 13 year old kid wants to get a job, more power to them. However, if they don't, it's the parents' responsibility to provide for that child until they're an adult mainly because, at least in this society, kids aren't raised to be factory workers by 13.<p>You're looking at it from a perhaps pragmatic point of view, but you're missing the human factor; children aren't some <i>investment</i> you can liquidate if it doesn't work out. Having a child is a conscious decision to bring another human being into this world -- a human being who never actually <i>asked</i> to be brought. Once you do that it becomes your responsibility to care for and raise that person (or find someone else who can) regardless of whether or not they provide a return on investment.",1226276676

It makes sense & no one rational would argue that regardless of the lvel, employment would stay the same. At $100 p/h, the level of employment would decrease. On the chalkboard, the biggest most straightforward effect would be that most jobs paying less then that would cease to exist. The other effects of pushing the remaining low pay jobs over the line & a few of the ones close to it up a bit seem to have a hard job of it to make the whole thing worthwhile.<p>But the real world experience doesn't paint such a grim picture. Minimum wage changes, have not been shown in real world case studies to have very much of an effect on employment rates. The effects are usually cloudy & cannot be distinguished from the effects of say, a credit crisis.<p>Now economists can rationalise this in lots of ways. Maybe the labor market tends to place employers of low wage employees in better bargaining positions, so when you look at the difference between what a worker is willing to earn (there is no floor other then what his other options set) & what an employer is willing to pay (the marginal output of that labor), they settle closer to the bottom. Perhaps the various wildcards of social & psychological effects of the difference between a minimum wage job & welfare supplements or some such wishy-washy effect is screwing with things. You can even come up with all sorts of circular sounding arguments about stimulating spending by putting money in the hands of the poor. To put it on the chalkboard you need to talk abut it in terms of information availability, market power, mobility, secondary effects etc.<p>But when you take a step back, there just aren't many good examples of minimum wage humiliating itself in the same way that grain price floors or wool subsidies have. For such a heavy handed economic policy it has remarkably little catastrophe that goes with it. No  stockbroker surpluses being dumped on unsuspecting thord world markets. No stockpiles of teachers that need to be refined into ethanol at a cost of 20X higher then cane ethanol.<p>The automatic rejection of minimum wage increases based on the classic economic theories is not rational.",1226275851

358646,comment,358490,358545,0,0,Rod,,,"While I do agree that electronics is learned by experimentation, IMHO the Arduino board is a bad starting point.<p>I think that the best way to learn electronics is to start with the very basics (resistors, capacitors, coils, voltage dividers, simple RC and RL circuits, etc), then learn something about op-amps, then move on to nonlinear devices such as diodes and transistors. No math is needed, and simple circuits are easy to build. Building an analog amplifier is not hard, and it's quite rewarding to design and build something that actually works. If one is really devoted to the art of electronics, building a tube amplifier is even more rewarding ;-)<p>After the basics of analog electronics, one can move to digital circuits, learn about interfacing, what the difference between RTL and TTL is, etc, etc. Playing with logic gates on a breadboard is fun and instructive. The basics of DAC's and ADC's are fundamental too.<p>Finally, one is ready to move to microprocessors and stuff like the Arduino. Knowing the basics, one can actually build cool stuff with microprocessors, simple actuators and sensors. One knows how to build and connect sensors to microcontrollers, one knows what's happening in the ADC, one understands what makes it all work.<p>I believe that starting with the Arduino board right away is like choosing Visual Basic as a first programming language: it hides the interesting details, and it prevents one from seeing the big picture.

429659,comment,428785,428855,0,0,grandalf,,,"I think the meat of your comment is in the story about how Citibank's failure makes it harder for you to find a job.<p>First, note that if it weren't for regulators deciding on the amount of reserve capital Citibank was required to hold, the market would probably have demanded that it hold much more.  For a long time iBanks have been benefiting from the Fed's power to bail them out.  Unlike banks, whose asymmetric liquidity is due to customer deposits, iBanks are risk-taking businesses who are just trying to make people rich.  If Yahoo can fail, why not Citibank?<p>So you were actually a temporary beneficiary of SEC and Fed policies that led to the over-leveraging of Citibank's capital and your previous ease at finding a job.  Your major life decisions were perhaps influenced by this false sense of reality.<p>On to your thoughts on happiness:  Would people be happier if they weren't allowed to eat junk food?  What about if they weren't allowed to drop out of college?  What about if they believed in a specific version of the Christian God?  What if they wore an American flag arm band at all times in public?<p>It's highly subjective what makes people happiest.

Meanwhile, the Russians are using an incrementally improved capsule design from the '60s that's simpler, cheaper, and safer.<p>I'm not saying that a true reusable speacecraft wouldn't be revolutionary.  And maybe it's possible with '10s tech in a way that it wasn't in the '70s.  But picking ""reusable"" as a goal in and of itself, rather than using metrics like reliability or cost per pound to orbit, seems like a dodgy business.",1317347920

Often they get paid directly for these.  This is a fundamental part of how academia works, and has been (in various forms) for centuries.<p>I worked in Silicon Valley as a sysadmin and programmer in 1996-97 and 2000-2006, at a total of seven different companies.  I've also worked professionally at a professional services company, a defense contractor, and freelance for various clients (primarily in the US).  I don't think I've ever seen an employment contract that purported to prohibit me from ""doing professional work not associated with [my] current job"".  In some cases I have proposed modifications to confidentiality agreements with the explicit purpose of ensuring that I could moonlight safely (for previous clients, normally).

3055203,comment,3054645,3055012,1,0,ShawnJG,,,"you're right, ""avoiding your customers"" is not a scalable long-term solution for deployment. As businesses, big or small become more global this will become a bigger problem. As I'm sitting here reading this I see a potential for new business. We need to find some way to filter traffic. Think about two different versions of the website existing at the same address and in front of the website sits a fork (like a fork in the road) that splits incoming traffic into two groups. As traffic comes in a portion, say 20% is then the  diverted to your brand-new deployment while the rest, 80% is directed to your older site. It's almost like having an semi-open beta in regards to the new deployment. It will be tested in real time under real circumstances. Then as bugs get ironed out you can increase the ratio from 80 – 20 gradually until all traffic is now being fed into the brand-new live site.\nso who wants to co-found this with me? we might be able to make it in time for the next round of Y Combinator!<p>by the way I didn't think you were saying that you should deploy during your busiest time, I just met all things being equal, the should definitely look for ""off-peak"" times to rollout new deployments. But we both seem to agree that the long-term solution. Globalization is going to make off-peak times a thing of the past. Hence see my solution above, we can get ahead of it and make some money.",1317347578

That strongly suggests that open access works better for distributing research <i>even within the academy</i>, which is just common sense — open-access papers are easier to discuss, find links to on Reddit and Wikipedia, and often simply obtain.  Outside the academy, where it's even harder to measure readership, we can expect the effect to be much more extreme, since most people outside the academy actually have to pay to read non-open-access papers.",1317347097

What these titles communicate internally and to the board is something like:<p>""I am joining this startup and doing a buttload of work under the assumption that I will be the effective leader (or, CTO = effective technology leader) of the the company, and if anyone wants to make me step down from this, it will <i>actually</i> be a demotion and it <i>will</i> be an issue"".<p>This doesn't mean ""I will have a tantrum and leave"".

However, it may be what's contingent on someone doing a pile of work for very little money - part of their vision of the startup might be not suddenly acquiring a layer of people to report to who have been parachuted in after the hard, nasty work has been done.<p>If you want to make it clear that at any moment, the guy who thinks he going to run the company or the technical aspects of the company can have someone parachuted in on top of them, then denying them the CxO title is a good way of communicating that.

These devices were heading back to Eventbrite HQ after being used at Maker Faire New York, an event you registered to attend through Eventbrite. When we found out that the devices were stolen, we immediately notified law enforcement authorities of the situation. We then set up a remote password lock on the devices and initiated a remote data wipe. We also worked quickly to determine what data was stored within the application's database on those specific pieces of hardware.<p>I am notifying you of this incident because we believe your email address, and, if you elected to share it, first and last name, were on one of the stolen iPads and could potentially be exposed. Eventbrite collected this information so that we could send you PDF tickets and payment receipts, and confirm ticket purchases on-site for those people who didn’t bring a printed ticket.<p>We know that having your personal data compromised is a violation of the trust you place in Eventbrite, and we offer you our deepest apologies. While we believe the risk for criminal misuse of your email addresses is low, we take your security and privacy seriously and believe that it's best to be open and transparent. We encourage you to monitor your email account closely for suspicious messages and not share financial or sensitive information over email. Please note that Eventbrite will never ask for passwords or credit card numbers over email.<p>To prevent this from happening again, we have updated our iPad application, Eventbrite At The Door, to encrypt all email addresses collected on-site at events, and we have made changes to all our mobile applications, including our newest version of Easy Entry, so that they will no longer store email addresses collected from online orders on mobile hardware. And on top of these technical fixes, we are putting in place increased security measures for the transportation of company-issued iPads, so that they will no longer store any personally identifiable data while in transit.<p>I encourage you to write to me with any questions you have about our security procedures. It's something that we take seriously and we take full responsibility for our mistake. You can reach me at kevin.hartz@eventbrite.com or call our support hotline at 866-528-2027.",1317345440

3055061,comment,3053494,3054610,1,0,daggerrz,,,"You make some very good points here. Although we started from scratch with Scala, we decided to use Spring for several reasons. I mention one in the talk - we initially adopted Scala for the language and syntax itself, and it made sense at the time to mitigate some technical risks by sticking to a well-known and familiar architecture / wiring / configuration model.<p>As we have become more familiar with the language, FP and the Scala idioms, we have definitely become less comfortable with our Spring ""legacy"". Initially, we felt that @BeanProperty annotations and setter injection saved us some boiler plate, but now most will shudder with having uninitialized vars. Constructor injection is somewhat better, but    the XML DSL of Spring is still ridiculously verbose. Luckily, this doesn't bother us much in the day-to-day work, we spend most of our writing idiomatic Scala.<p>As our platform and the entire Scala ecosystem and libraries have evolved, the Spring and JEE ""legacy"" has become much less prevalent in our system than it was originally. We use a pimped version of Spring JDBC, Spring contexts for wiring, a Servlet container, but that's about it. In fact, we could probably easily rewrite the whole Spring config in Scala and drop most of the Spring deps.<p>I couldn't agree more with you in that the us in the Scala community really should come up with an accepted way of handling configuration and wiring. Having worked with more than a few Scala libraries, I can definitely attest that the plethora of configuration styles used can be a pain to manage (and dependencies -> configgy-nologgy, anyone?).<p>We regularly talk about this topic in the NYC Scala community, but we haven't come up anything good yet. Personally, I strongly believe that dependency injection is the way to go and that singletons and factories (which are fairly common in Scala libs) are evil. Most long-time Java devs will agree that we've been down that road before (gotta love JNDI)... That being said, we did not adopt Scala to fight for status quo, so we'll keep an open mind.<p>Dag",1317344928

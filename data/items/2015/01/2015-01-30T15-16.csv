On small projects, it&#x27;s top-notch.<p>But the future of CoffeeScript is bleak because many software designers are beginning to understand the value of type systems, e.g. TypeScript and Flow, for building maintainable Javascript code bases, and this means CoffeeScript is out of the picture for good because its long term design goal is to remain a minimalistic language, and doesn&#x27;t intend to support these ideas. There have been attempts[0] to fork it to add a legitimate type system to it so it can scale, but they have faltered.

I&#x27;m a seasoned IT professional (with a management / enterprise architecture background) and when I get the chance I use some of my spare time to help inexperienced people (usually college level or just out of college kids of my friends) with advice and a bit of mentor-ship on what they should learn so that they complete their academic knowledge with skills required in the real world. I&#x27;ve been doing it so far for software development. I basically come with an idea of a small project and ask them to develop, recommend techniques, review their code, approach, do some Skype office hours, etc. 
It&#x27;s not a big effort for me, I do it for the good citizen effect and I helped them learn useful things and get jobs. In software development only, though.<p>The question :
I have 2 new &quot;students&quot; which reached out to me for a professional reconversion and it seems that targeting an analyst profile is the best fit as they lack any technical background and at least in Europe is a good entry point in the IT world. 
I built up some sort of a curricula but I face a challenge: this exercise is really helped by actual challenges and there is only that much &quot;do a use case diagram for somebody getting money out of an ATM&quot; type of small challenges I can give them. 
Has anyone been facing a similar issue or would care to throw some idea of meaningful projects I could get them working on to develop analyst type of skills they could later use to get a real job ? Again, the challenge is not really inventing a project (&quot;write specs and gather requirements for a job board&quot;) but inventing a project that is meaningful and requires little interaction (I don&#x27;t have the time to impersonate all the different persona they would have to interact with : stakeholders, managers, architects, developers, etc..)",1422631993

This is in contrast to, for instance, JavaScript (which debatably has its own merits) where if you want to script on the web client, that&#x27;s your choice, love it or leave it. In the Go domain, there are countless alternatives.<p>I find it hard to even express clearly why Go feels so...natural and productive. But it does. And one of those reasons is that the language is so simple and, well, crude, that you don&#x27;t stop and sit on questions of approach. Somehow it works.<p>If we need to stick with vehicle analogies, it&#x27;s more like someone is using a dumptruck to move massive piles of Earth, but complaining that the steering isn&#x27;t as light as their car.<p>And FWIW, when people talk about the lack of generics causing them great pain, usually they aren&#x27;t making a solution, but instead are toying with the language. Doing the typical &quot;make a library that solves all problems&quot; sort of thing. When I am using Go it is almost always for a specific, practical requirement (as duct tape between processes, to orchestrate some high performance C code, etc), and it just...isn&#x27;t a problem. It really isn&#x27;t. Unless you&#x27;re making library code it just isn&#x27;t this issue it is held to be.",1422630750

I&#x27;m not sure because I hadn&#x27;t made the calculations, so any confirmation or refutation is welcome. Let&#x27;s try:<p>When two normal molecules, with electrons, are close, they can form different kind of bonds. The weakest bond is the &quot;van der Waals&quot; bond. It&#x27;s caused because the electrons of the molecules change their position slightly due to the presence of the other molecule.<p>In this experiment they only replace the electron of a hydrogen atom by a muon. The muons have much more mass than the electrons, so the radius of the orbit is much smaller. (They are quantum particles, so they don&#x27;t have orbits, but please forgive this technical detail.) As the orbits are smaller, the displacement caused by the other molecule is smaller, so the van der Walls force is smaller.<p>In the normal (electron) case the van der Walls force cause the formation of the intermediate molecule. In this case (muon) the van der Waals forcé is so weak that other effects are more important.<p>[I left out the part about zero point energy. It&#x27;s also interesting but this explanation is becoming larger than the article :) .]",1422630670

8972335,comment,8970733,8971068,0,0,Gabriel439,,,"You use `inproc` and `inshell` for piping.  For example, here&#x27;s the type of `inshell`:<p><pre><code>    inshell
        :: Text        -- Shell command
        -> Shell Text  -- Standard input to feed command
        -> Shell Text  -- Standard output produced by command
</code></pre>
I made one intentional simplification in the API, which was to not provide a way to capture standard error.  It&#x27;s definitely possible to provide such a utility, but I wanted to simplify things as much as possible in the first release before the slow onslaught of feature cruft begins.  If there were such a utility, it would have this type:<p><pre><code>    both
        :: Text        -- Shell command
        -> Shell Text  -- Standard input to feed command
        -> Shell (Either Text Text)
</code></pre>
... and you could selectively listen to just stderr or stdout by taking advantage of the fact that pattern match failures short-circuit downstream commands:<p><pre><code>    Left txt <- both -- only read stderr
</code></pre>
There is one more shell library that I know of: `process-streaming`.  I actually didn&#x27;t know about `shell_monad` (that&#x27;s the one most similar in spirit to what I wrote).<p>The main reason I rolled my own library is that this was written with the specific audience of people who didn&#x27;t know any Haskell, but were comfortable with Python or Bash.  My actual goal is to convince people internally at Twitter to use Haskell instead of Python for large scripts.  I reviewed all those libraries (with the exception of shell_monad) to see if I felt comfortable marketing them to non-Haskell programmers and none of them felt like the right level of abstraction to me.  I almost ended up going with Shelly, but in the process of polishing shelly for internal usage I found myself continually wrapping things with better names, different types, and providing missing features to get a single import umbrella, so I just stopped and asked: &quot;why not just do this as a cohesive single library instead?&quot;.  Also, `shelly` does not provide any `IO`-only commands: everything has to be wrapped in the `Sh` monad.<p>As for the other libraries, `shell-conduit` was too complex for new users in my opinion and `hell` is not embedded within Haskell (it&#x27;s a separate language), and I wanted to keep the features of Haskell.  I still need some more time to review `shell_monad` to see if I made a mistake by ignoring it.",1422630570

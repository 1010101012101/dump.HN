Surely it must be a CIA front? I've argued in favor of the kids theory being plausible. This would seem to be evidence in that theory's favor.<p>'course, it could just be the front finding a fall guy, but... Occam's razor.

While I did not fully grasp the intricacies of the transfer principle, working with the axioms was easy enough and I was able to learn calculus at a level such that I would find Analysis easier going than most later on. I also learned about hyperreals, the concept of nonstandard extensions, that the reals are a crazy concept before leaving highschool.

The NIH is the largest research agency, with a more than $30 billion dollar budget, so this does cover a lot of US research, but it doesn't cover research from many other agencies.<p>For much more on the NIH policy, see the links in this article: <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/12/oa-mandate-at-nih-now-law.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2007/12/oa-mandate-at-nih...</a><p>There has been a concerted (though not yet successful) effort to extend this type of open access mandate to all US federal agencies with budgets over 100 million.  See, for example: <a href=""http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/frpaa/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/frpaa/index.shtml</a><p>With a lot of work, I believe these efforts are likely to be successful.  But there is real opposition, not just from some journal publishers, but also from some politicians. See, for example, the efforts by John Conyers (D-Mi) to roll back the NIH open access policy: <a href=""http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/10-02-08.htm#nih"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/10-02-08.htm#n...</a><p>In the UK, all seven UK Research Councils have similar open access policies.  The last one to adopt such a policy was the Physical Sciences and Engineering Council, which I believe is the one relevant to computer science research.  That policy was adopted in 2009, I believe, and so we're only starting to see the effects now.",1308700613
2680927,comment,2679769,2679769,5,0,epenn,,,"Maybe this is some of my love for C shining through, but I've always thought of an array index as denoting the distance from the array pointer to the current/desired position. Thus in an array of integers for example, array[0] represents what's in memory at the pointer itself. array[1] is then the value in memory at sizeof(int) * 1 away. array[2] is sizeof(int) * 2 away, and so on.<p>A good analogy to this way of thinking is a person's age. When a person is born, or in other words when a person is at the beginning of the array of years that he/she exists, the age index is 0. At the person's first birthday, the age index is 1. Then 2, 3, and so on.<p>I guess the tl;dr then is that I agree with Dijkstra that array indices should begin at zero.",1308700580

This includes both physical locations and, usually, computers. Additionally, case law makes a distinction between property that you personally own and/or control (e.g. your house that you live in), and property that is shared (e.g. the apartment you rent with a buddy), and recognizes that the part of something that is ""yours"" (your room in your shared apartment, for instance) is separate from you buddy's (their room).

To use your terminology, you are claiming that it is the responsibility of the researcher to document everything he (or she, whatever) does for every ""circle"", and I'm claiming to the contrary.<p>To that end, let me describe the firehose that is today's science publication. It's been two weeks since I last read through my science RSS feeds, which contain selected publications from about ten journals. In that time, there are around 1000 entries. That's just a small selection of the field... there are many more journals I'm choosing to ignore simply so that my sips from the firehose aren't completely overwhelming.<p>I will suggest that having every researcher document every finding for every circle is a tremendous waste of time, as the vast majority of that ""documentation"" would never be read, as no one in the outer circles has interest in it, even if it was written in an accessible manner. In that mindset, I don't think it's the responsibility of the researcher to document his work for the public. Furthermore, given the huge amount of research put out each week (like my RSS feed above shows), just surveying all of it regularly to find what's interesting to the ""outer circles"" and then writing up in appropriate terminology is close to a full-time job.<p>I know that in neuroscience, the field I'm currently working, we have the Society for Neuroscience (<a href=""http://www.sfn.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfn.org/</a>) which puts in a lot of work to make the general findings accessible to the public. They do a yeoman's job, I think, and if you browse their site you'll find a lot of very recent science written for the ""outer circles"", as you call them. If you're interested in a field, find that field's SfN and check out what they wrote; don't look to the experts themselves for regular updates.",1308699155

But, that post noted that no high courts had actually held that, and at least one appeals court had just held to the contrary.<p>This is in the normal case, at least; things would probably be different if it were deemed to be some sort of overt act, e.g. if a police chief orders a raid designed to intentionally damage an innocent third party's interests (and you have evidence to show that).",1308698046

The best thing to do is to focus on a topic you really like, that you can throw yourself in to, and this will help you forget about the hair. Think about what you feel you have a need to do, be it political, artistic, scientific, educational, charitable, or technological. Once you have found something that is very important to you, set about doing it. Along the way, you will meet people and you won&#x27;t be worrying about yourself but wanting to share whatever it is you are doing.

This is a fun, but totally normal result.<p>First of all, there are quite a few linear time sorting algorithms. Radix, pigeonhole, and counting sort are all linear time sorting algorithms. The popular result that any comparison-based sorting algorithm works in O(n log n) applies _specifically_ to comparison-based sorting algorithms, and not those like the above. So, even if you ignore the underlying mechanics of the OS scheduler and assume sleep works &quot;perfectly&quot;, the result would not that unusual.<p>Second off, in the comments there appears to be considerable time worrying about the technicalities of the scheduler, the nondeterministic nature of sleep, and so on, and whether this really implies linear time bound. IMHO these are not worth worrying about because we already have linear time sorting algorithms. It&#x27;s fine to assume the scheduler adds no significant asymptotic cost here, even if we know differently.<p>Third off, remember that all of these sorting bounds assume machines of the Von Neumann architecture. In particular, this model assumes constant time memory and constant time comparison operations. In cases where you&#x27;re comparing really big numbers, these bounds get worse. This is easy to forget, but worth remembering just since we&#x27;re on the subject anyway.",1419576671

8798289,comment,8797907,8798228,0,0,dogma1138,,,"Many courses on Coursera, edX and similar sites are supervised while they are live.
If you enroll to a &quot;live&quot; MOOC you actually get most of it, as well as interaction with other students. If you go trough an archived course you don&#x27;t really get it and that&#x27;s when the &quot;MOOC&quot; turns from a course to an information source.
Considering that &quot;MOOC&#x27;s&quot; are supposed to be an online resource i don&#x27;t see how an in-person supervision can be achieved regardless of the fees.
This is again an issue of miss managing expectations, what you describe amounts to an open university and not an online course.
Open Uni&#x27;s do offer everything from educational advisers to pre-arranged study groups and access to teachers and TA&#x27;s but they also come at a cost ranging from anywhere from 50% to 200% of the normal cost of a degree.
People drop out of anything and while MOOC&#x27;s have a much higher drop out rate than normal education it has much less to do with what they offer and more to do with how people treat and what they expect from them in the first place.
In the course of my job i actually have taken quite a few of them when i needed to tackle projects with an unfamiliar scope for example I&#x27;ve taken several &quot;economics&quot; classes when i had to do a project regarding stock and high frequency trading.
I&#x27;m an information security consultant, and although i am quite familiar with traditional finance systems used for banking, i didn&#x27;t have enough knowledge of how stock trading and HFT works to be able to truly identify critical issue with such systems (mainly in regards to discovering logic flaws, race conditions and similar issues).
So I&#x27;ve found 3 courses i thought would give me enough information and invested the time needed in them. I did &quot;drop&quot; 2 of them but just because they went too deep into economical theories which wasn&#x27;t what i needed. But i did complete one of them until the end and learned quite a bit from it about how modern day commodity trading works.
But I&#x27;ve also treated the &quot;MOOC&quot; as i would any other course I&#x27;ve started at 9 am, finished at 5-6pm and actually structured it like if i were at school or at working (which technically I was).
People who just consume online courses when they get bored over the weekends or when they have their 2am &quot;life changing resolutions&quot; will never be able to get anything out of them even with all the guidance in the world.
A coach or an adviser will not make any one capable of learning on a bus or at 11pm after a full work day, a gym and a bar visit. There is a reason why night school has higher drop rates than normal school and it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s harder. People need energy and the ability to focus on education otherwise it&#x27;s just a waste of time.
And if you sitting in a class from 6-9 is borderline possible for education than what good will it be when you consume it on a tablet while trying not to make eye contact on the train?",1419576412

There is a lot of material about how to converse and become interesting, but all of them require practice in front of people. It <i>sucks</i> for the first few times, just like starting a new workout routine. It will feel discouraging when you don&#x27;t see results the first few times. Keep at it.

Yeah, that&#x27;s a &quot;DUH!&quot; kind of statement, but buried in there is a grain of truth. Sit down with a pen and paper and start listing all the cool things you have seen and done in your life. What makes you excited? What makes you wistful? What do you long for? Use that list as a foundation, even if you only have a couple of items. If it&#x27;s blank, then you have the opportunity to explore many different experiences and see which you like and don&#x27;t like.<p>The hardest part of all of this is getting started. Intertia is a hell of a resistance. Start small and get into a habit. Habits can be hard to start, but they are also hard to break. Starting small helps get over the initial inertia with small steps while you build the habit. Once you start getting into the rhythm, you add harder and more difficult steps to build up your habit. This is how you build any successful system or learn a new skill. Be open to mistakes and failure as an opportunity to examine and learn.

But I think that testing is still the bigger problem; a lot of scientific software is used in conjunction with other scientific software, and the interfaces themselves are also usually undefined and untested.  So something as simple as IT upgrading a package to fix a bug or add a feature might break a lab&#x27;s workflow in ways that are difficult to detect.  It&#x27;s easy to mess this kind of software up by creating code that produces incorrect results despite appearing OK by the field&#x27;s dominant scoring criteria.<p>Also publish and forget... that&#x27;s just the natural fallout of the way research is conducted and funded.  I&#x27;ve written scientific software that I don&#x27;t feel much personal obligation to maintain or update.  It&#x27;s challenging work which has greatly reduced payoff (to the powers that be) after it has been tallied on the scoreboard.  Also, most positions in scientific labs are on a clock; not exactly an environment that fosters long-term stewardship.<p>I&#x27;d love to see science funding agencies spend a couple million to fund reasonably sized groups of 5-10 programmers/scientists to produce code over ~3 year funding cycles.  Just to make sure that signals don&#x27;t get crossed, these groups should be told not to spend a single minute of their time on publishing to journals.

A MOOC is not an arbitrary source of information or a &quot;lecture on demand&quot; service, it&#x27;s an education platform.<p>This is why the lecture library which Standford uploaded to youtube since like what 2009 is not a MOOC, in fact i would go as far as saying that most &quot;examples&quot; the author provided in his article (although nameless) are not MOOC&#x27;s..<p>A &quot;MOOC&quot; is still a course whether it&#x27;s online or not and to be so it has to provide a structured environment for it&#x27;s curriculum. 
It&#x27;s should be seen as an evolution of the long distance courses many people have taken for over a century not some podcast you throw on your smart phone or tablet while you take the train to work.<p>People who treat MOOC&#x27;s as educational materials and take them seriously benefit from them, people who take them as some instant &quot;smart pill&quot; content that they absorb on the tube can just as well read the free daily papers...<p>So yeah while bloated smarty pants like the author might bicker and moan about just how bad and doomed MOOC&#x27;s are I&#x27;m sure the tens of thousands of people from Asia, Africa and the Middle East who are lucky enough to have internet access do find them quite useful.<p>Heck I&#x27;ve seen class A universities steal i mean &quot;borrow&quot; material from Coursera, edX and from Standford (and others) video lectures plenty of times.

When you turn on the TV, how do you figure out whether a non-hero character is a bad guy? If he&#x27;s bald, he always is. There is definitely a heavy cultural bias against bald people.<p>Aesthetics is a big part of it though. People with hair can pull off a lot of looks that simply are grotesque on bald people, but the good news is: it&#x27;s something you do have control over. The worst thing you can do when bald is being fat. So work out, and wear nice clothes. These things matter <i>a lot more</i> when you&#x27;re bald, you&#x27;ll notice the impact immediately. In fact, these things matter a lot more as you get older in general.<p>Confidence is another thing you can actively work on. People tune you out if <i>you</i> think you&#x27;re not interesting. While the deck is stacked against you a little bit due to things outside your control, the biggest impact on your confidence is, well, your confidence. If all else fails, learn to imitate confident people and don&#x27;t be discouraged by failure. One of the things you can learn from observing confident people is that their failure rate <i>is not actually that low</i>, for the most part they are just really good at concealing or downplaying failure. If you suck at networking, that&#x27;s not due to baldness, it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t enjoy networking to begin with, because you don&#x27;t have a lot of practice, or because you get discouraged easily. I can identify with that, but believe me it&#x27;s something that gets better if you&#x27;re determined to become better at it.<p>A certain percentage of people will never date you, never trust you, never want to listen to you. This applies to everybody on the planet. Sure, that percentage will be much lower for a non-bald good-looking person, but the essence of the fact remains: you can&#x27;t make <i>everybody</i> like you. Try to train your internal classifier and filter for those whom you <i>can</i> build a relationship with. Attempting to win over people who reflexively dislike you is a fool&#x27;s errant; there are lot of &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; you can pick up instead using a fraction of the energy.<p>The nice thing about people who make a lot of snap categorizations on a whim, like never date|befriend|trust|invest in|talk to a guy who has attribute X, is they come around just as fast if they see you&#x27;re successful.

You guys should clearly state in the marketing and in-app that the call gets a first hop encrypted, then dumped unencrypted out to the Internet/PSTN (which nowadays are rather intermingled, sometimes when least expected).<p>Other stuff like &quot;100% dedicated network – no sharing or leasing&quot; sounds like it&#x27;s probably untrue, or uses a special value of 100%. Either way, such statements should be backed with clarification.<p>Finally, there was a PR with Mike Janke, linked here on HN about a year ago. I can&#x27;t seem to find it now, but he says a bunch of misleading/false things while writing off competition and makes SC come off rather slimy. Y&#x27;all shouldn&#x27;t let him talk for the company as it makes the engineers look bad. (Not to mention the whole thing about Blackphone - a closed source fork of Android with a few 3rd party apps, no mention of the baseband processor issue, yet billed as some amazing breakthrough and it&#x27;s own OS.)<p>SC should lower the hype and be transparent about things. Overall, I get the distinct impression it&#x27;s a marketing joint bankrolled by a non technical founder, who hired some good names and provided a commercial vehicle for zRTP. Which by itself is fine, but the execution feels more marketing than technical.<p>PS, if you&#x27;re using FreeSwitch, then I gotta ask: where are all the CVEs? Are you fixing them privately, publicly without announcement, or are you using FS without a security audit? (The only reason I mention this is SC often seems a major sponsor of ClueCon.) If not FS, what is your VoIP platform, and in what language is it written?",1419573723

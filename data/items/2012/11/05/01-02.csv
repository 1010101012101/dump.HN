It's hard to specify, exactly, but I think Omni had a powerful influence on my life (perhaps unconsciously). Reading through the first issue, I'm struck by the optimism and the almost naive -- by modern standards -- reverence for science. And yet, those feelings are largely still with me and have no doubt led to my career in software development.<p>Also standing out, a survey about the expected date of possible events:<p><pre><code>  1. First woman elected president.\n  2. Nuclear war between the US & USSR\n  3. US commits troops to Africa to counter Communist incursions\n  4. Gasoline reaches 25 cents/liter\n  5. First terrorist use of nuclear weapons\n  6. Return to pre-sixties standards of morality and the end of ""Permissive Society.""\n  7. Manned landing on Mars\n  8. First public paying passengers on an orbital spaceflight\n  9. Industrialization of space becomes an important source of income\n  10. Computer beats (human) world chess champion\n  11. World shortage of animal protein makes meat too expensive for the average american household.\n  12. Contact made with extra-terrestrial life.\n  13. A human is cloned\n  14. ESP is accepted as fact by the majority of scientists.\n  15. Average life expectancy is 100 years or more\n  16. Computers have self-awareness and are more intelligent than humans.\n  17. The majority of South American governments become communist or ultra-left\n  18. Economic collapse of the west as predicted by Marxist commentators.\n  19. Revolution in the USSR leads to overthrow of the existing regime and replacement by a liberal ""pro-western"" government.\n  20. Marriage as an institution virtually disappears within the US, with over 75% of babies born out of wedlock. \n</code></pre>\nOne amazing thing about this survey is that the timeline <i>ended</i> with 2000+. Meaning, the time we're living in now was the far out future by Omni standards. And of these, I believe only #4 and #19 (partially) came about before 2000. Since then, only #8, #10.",1352080528

4741899,comment,4741833,4741833,3,0,zbowling,,,"I disagree with a few tips here. Rather than code to exact resolutions (eg: `if ([CCDirector sharedDirector].winSize.width == 568)`) build your games to be adaptive to the screen. That way when a new device is released you don't end up going through and making your code swiss cheese.<p>A better idea is to maybe make decisions when a size is greater than a certain amount, but still layout to relative amounts to the screen. This will make it easier to support landscape and portrait on 4/3 devices as well and not just 3/2 and 16/9 screens. Perhaps add additional HUD when you have the space.<p>Better yet, setup your simulator for several different sizes, and every now and then make sure everything still fits: <a href=""http://0xced.blogspot.com/2012/08/prepare-your-apps-for-new-iphone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0xced.blogspot.com/2012/08/prepare-your-apps-for-new-...</a><p>Later come talk to us at Apportable (YC2011 <a href=""http://apportable.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apportable.com/</a> ) and you can use our SDK to have your Cocos2D game run natively on hundreds of different resolutions and DPIs on Android.",1352080397

One of the tools I use for this falls under the domain of ""configuration management"", with the best products being Chef[1] or Puppet[2], or just writing a normal bash script that installs your Rails stack and checks out your code from github.<p>When utilizing these technologies, I usually do the following:<p>1. Create a virtual image that has your CM tools + dependencies installed on it.\n2. Add a bootstrap script that runs at boot (usually /etc/rc.local on Linux). This script will acquire and parse user-data[3] that is provided in the provisioning request to EC2[4], an then kick off your main configuration logic.\n3. Capture the image and use it as your base image that you perform deployments from.<p>Feel free to let me know if you have any questions with this method!

It took a little bit to get used to the gestures, but I like it.<p>I like this approach more than getting pushed updates on my pre-selected news stories (how Circa works). Problem with Circa is that you have to make a decision right then and there. You have to decide if you care to hear about this story in the future or not. And the result is a) i subscribe to very little subject or b) I over subscribe to many subjects and get overwhelmed with updates, and this dilutes my interest in all of the subject.<p>But that's not how we generally read the Newsaper or any content for that matter.

In my experience, law enforcement <i>always</i> stretches it's powers to the limit, and only retreats when courts or legislatures explicitly set limits. Now, there are limits in this law: the protestor wearing the mask has to be doing something illegal before wearing the mask becomes a crime in itself. But who makes the determination on the scene as to whether the protestor is doing something illegal? Law enforcement. So, while the intent of the law will is to reduce the damage done by masked protestors, the effect of the law will be to give law enforcement yet another legal club to use against all protestors, peaceful or not. After all, if the Occupy Wall Street protests have taught us anything, it is that law enforcement sees any defiance of its authority, no matter how peaceful, as dangerous and illegal. Therefore, my prediction is that this law against masks will be used indiscriminately, against <i>all</i> protestors, peaceful or not. For that reason, I think this is a terrible law and that it should be repealed as soon as possible.",1352080256

He's smart, creative, young, ambitious, pulled together a good team and created a great looking app but I don't believe this will solve the problem.<p>Before I created Skim That[1], a human powered news summarizing website, I looked into how Summly and other TL;DR algorithms worked to decide which direction I wanted to go in. I concluded that, even if you create the best algorithm that takes the best sentences from a story, you're still going to end up with a poorly written and out of context paragraph.<p>Try it yourself. Read a story and try to manually find a few sentences that best summarize it. Then, without rewriting anything, try to put those sentences into a paragraph or two. You'll find that you end up with a confusing summary that's difficult to read.<p>The amount of words Summly limited itself to (one iPhone screen worth) is brilliant. It keeps things simple and easy to skim through but what's produced by the service is so short that it should be called a ""tease"" not a ""summary"".<p>Of course, the Summly app does hit the nail on the head with a summary every once in a while but this hit or miss style makes for a bad experience.<p>Summarizing algorithms aren't the automation challenge, those will <i>never</i> work right as demonstrated by the ""try it yourself"" challenge above. The real automation challenge is rewriting the important sentences in such a way that they make sense together and provide proper context.<p>On Skim That, I'm trying to solve the problem by crowd sourcing the summarizing process and asking readers to summarize a story. I've gotten a few people to give it a shot and several of those continue to summarize stories every once in a while.

When researching how to put together an IQ test it became clear to me that from the beginning IQ testing was not, and never will be, a valid way to rate intelligence.<p>The simplest explanation is that ""IQ score"" is not fundamentally different than ""SAT score"" or ""GMAT score"" and is in a lot of ways worse because there are so many different interpretations and scoring methods for IQ.  You can score 150 on one test but it might be scored completely differently than a test someone else takes.  In other words, there is no agreed upon and copyrighted standard for IQ.<p>All of this type of testing really just sucks.  All we really know is that IQ testing (or SATs, etc.) measures... something.  And since people need to be quantified in some way, we use these scores for people-sorting.  We TOTALLY overuse these scores without understanding them, and people feel great or feel horrible about their scores because of their usage (which is unavoidable) and for what it seems to say about them (which is very little).<p>It is hard to not feel good or bad about your score, even knowing all of this.

How many users have no lock screen, weak passwords, use old versions of operating systems, let others play with their devices, share accounts etc?<p>What a user wants is for their devices to perform a job such as communication and entertainment.  It gets very confusing for technical folk who then fail to distinguish between goals and tasks.  (The software we write is focussed on tasks.)  Here is an excellent article on the distinction:  <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/goal-directed-software-design/184409952?pgno=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/goal-directed-software-design/1844099...</a><p>""security"" as such is not a goal - it is more an annoyance.  It is why you have to have a lock screen (which gets in the way of the goals), ""strong"" passwords, and worry about compromise.  Performing maintenance (which is what updates are about) are also not helping the goals - they are actually more work that also gets in the way of the goals.<p>A good way of looking at security is not as a binary on/off thing, but rather as an expense for someone who wants ""your stuff"".  Does it cost an attacker 1 cent, a dollar, a million dollars?  If ""security"" was part of the purchase decision process then it would be mentioned in the specs in some sort of measurable way.<p>Ultimately what will happen will only happen because of the economics or laws.  Laws that try to put liability on the developers won't work for many practical reasons.  What would be most effective is for it to be easy to for consumers to respond by taking their money elsewhere.  This happens when there is low barriers of entry to the market, and low/no switching costs, as well as the items being relatively cheap.  This is happening to various degrees, although it is fought tooth and nail by some (eg carriers in the US).",1352077332

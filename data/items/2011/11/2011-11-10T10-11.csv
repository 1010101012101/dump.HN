It's a rip off when they copy everything, and copy it badly.<p>For instance, the keyboard design on the Mac has ""separated"" keys because it's needed to give better structural support to the unibody frame. It's not just a ""cool design thing"". Jony Ive talks about it here: <a href=""http://youtu.be/t0fe800C2CU?t=2m46s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/t0fe800C2CU?t=2m46s</a><p>Watching other companies copy this keyboard design in many ways resembles the first people trying to fly by flapping their cloth covered wings. ""It looks exactly the same as what the bird does, dammit, why isn't it working?!""<p>Now, imagine how many different, _better_ products one could have if only more companies had someone as obsessed with product design as Ive, and gave him some authority.<p>What if some laptop manufacturer made a thinner, more sturdy ultraportable design that for some reason didn't need this keyboard design? It wouldn't have to look anything like the MBA, and it wouldn't be accused of being a rip-off.",1320922706

But I see no reason not to deride products which are clones of other companies' products with no improvements (or that are in fact worse).<p>Put it another way, I don't see a reason to automatically grant extra lenience or extra credit to anyone that produces a clone of an Apple product. This isn't golf and there are no handicaps. Either make a better product, or be ridiculed.<p>It's also worth remembering that all our deriding, ridiculing and arguing counts for little in the real world. As Jobs nicely put it in an interview (paraphrased): if we build something people want then they buy it and we get to come to work another day.",1320922653

That just frustrated me as I use Emacs and I rely on a working right Control key so much. I know that there are tools to remap keys. Tried various ones, but at the end of the day I was trying to make Mac act as X Windows and it just wasn not smooth. So I bought Samsung's 900 3XA.

The battery monitor's estimates are horribly inconsistent, and I haven't used it unplugged for long-enough stretches to drain the battery completely. So, at least for me, we can call it ""enough"".<p>I have used it for over 4 hrs of active use interspersed with sleep periods (e.g. with the lid closed) without running out. I plug it in whenever I can, which means it gets a little charged whenever I'm at home, at work or at the library (but not in lecture). My schedule means I rarely need to use it for more than three hours without being able to plug in at some point.<p>Since it doesn't use the switchable graphics cards that are popular in other laptops, this is not an issue. Unfortunately, I think it still does better on Windows.<p>That said, if it isn't enough, you can always get an extra sheet battery you could attach to the bottom of the laptop--it's pretty neat.",1320922064

Apple would have figured it out very quickly and would have taken steps to regain control of their pricing.<p>It is a program that provides financial benefit to poor students in exchange for a moral obligation. I see it as being more akin to stealing from a charity rather than a savvy or smart business opportunity. Being entrepreneurial is about providing a product or service to people, but not doing it at the cost to all others. It takes zero imagination to take advantage of a goodwill initiative, all it requires is a lack of moral compass.<p>I was a super-poor student from a low income family and I relied on both educational discounts and financing to get access to my own computer - so to know now that the program was screwed with by guys who were not exactly starving students really pisses me off.",1320921953

Of course, if you're not into Mac OS, you might as well get the Asus, which means its entry into the market benefits you.Even some non-Apple clones are competition and make the market much better for everyone.<p>As a college student, I think you'd get almost the same utility out of a nice netbook running Linux as you would an Air unless you're a heavy gamer.

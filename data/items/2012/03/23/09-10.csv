CISC processors are dead today, they stopped being a substantial part of the market in the late 90s. I'm sure they still exist somewhere in new devices (RAD hardened Pentiums, perhaps) but for the most part the CISC vs RISC battle is over, and RISC won overwhelmingly. But Tannenbaum thought that a necessary consequence of that would be that the x86 architecture would die due to the weaknesses of CISC processor designs. But what actually happened is that Intel (and later AMD and others of course) started making processors with a RISC core that support the x86 (IA32) instruction set through transparent op-code translation. Every Intel cpu since the Pentium-Pro has worked that way (and every AMD CPU since the Athlon).<p>You can't just wave your hands and say ""yeah, but he was <i>fundamentally</i> right in some ways though there were some things he couldn't have foreseen"". That's part of the deal, there's always something that you can't foreseen. Imagining that CISC's weaknesses are identical to the weaknesses of the x86 architecture are just the sort of naivety and shallow reasoning that can lead you to make woefully wrong predictions.",1332496759

Design is more abstract than code, yes, but it's just as fundamental a part of the resulting product.<p>Copying design, especially when the original source is so obvious, has damaging effects that are hard to quantify. Poor clones can directly damage the creation of a strong original brand and can preempt future creative product positioning. Because it is not user facing, identically copied code--when the design has been changed--has no such effects. Why do so many people believe that only copying code should be considered wrong when design has the potential to be more damaging? To me, they are both equally wrong.<p>Great artists steal.

3744272,comment,3744138,3744227,14,0,muyuu,,,"He was squarely wrong in that he made concrete predictions and these fell off dramatically.<p>He said in the early 90's that x86 would be dead in 5 years. If that's not a wrong prediction I don't know what is.<p>As for microkernels being superior to macrokernels, the trend has been to evolve into hybrid kernels (one of which Linux is now in practice). CISC vs RISC: same outcome. Hybrid approaches have come on top. Modern x86 processors are RISC inside, CISC outside and this produces concrete advantages by needing less memory bandwidth. Even if the instruction set was nominally RISC, we'd do more instruction pipelining producing a similar result. It's got to the point where the difference is nominal. We still call them x86 but they are fundamentally different processors. We still call them RISC and they do instruction compositing now.<p>He was WRONG with capitals, as usually ""religious"" and opinionated people are. There's rarely black and white in the real world. It's shades of grey.<p>Also, being off by a 400% in time scale, even if the outcome is similar as predicted, is being wrong no ifs or buts. Predictions like this mean total practical failure in any decision making.",1332494796

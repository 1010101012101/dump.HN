And much more than just ""a pain"" if their nodes are using technologies sensitive to kernel changes (which is often the case in HPC).",1236347794
505463,comment,505440,505440,0,0,Flemlord,,,"> Update March 6, 2009 8:10 a.m.: Another bookstore chain is getting into the e-book game. A news item yesterday indicates that Barnes & Noble has purchased Fictionwise, one of the longest-lived e-publishing companies around (it was selling e-books way back in 1998-99, when I worked at NuvoMedia, the maker of the Rocket eBook). Fictionwise has a very good e-book reading app called eReader; it works on the iPhone as well as Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian, and Windows Mobile devices, not to mention Windows and Macintosh computers and even the OQO handheld PC. So make that Option 4.",1236347658

We had a picture (remixed from Shaq's twitter profile page <a href=""http://twitter.com/the_real_shaq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/the_real_shaq</a> ), with him in a Suns jersey. Presumably he has people both for his personal brand and also those for the team he leads. I doubt the Suns would care much about, for example, a pirate copy of his music or movies.<p>One thing is pretty clear: Shaq is authentic on twitter, but the account is managed and monitored by a number of interested parties. That is obvious when you think of him like any other brand, but has left me a bit jaded about it.",1236347363

505441,comment,505321,505434,0,0,marksutherland,,,"Hmm. A more cynical explanation is that they all want to have the loudest CDs in the jukebox. In noisy public environments (pubs, parties, etc.) the volume of whatevers playing music is likely to be set according to the loudest tracks that are played. As a result anything quiet become hard to hear over the background noise of folk chatting. So you end up with a sort of prisoners dilemma scenario where it seems like you have no option but to master your CDs loud.<p>Similarly, adverts on TV are usually much louder than the shows they're interrupting to try and grab your attention and they all compete with each other for that attention. Very annoying.",1236346365

505434,comment,505321,505321,0,0,Edinburger,,,"I think the increasing importance of the car as a place where we listen to music may be a contributing factor. I have some old, well-mastered CD's which I love to listen to at home but they're hard to listen to in my car. The quiet sections are too quiet to hear above the engine/road noise and if I turn the volume up, the loud sections are too loud.<p>I'd much rather have a well-mastered CD and a 'Loud' button (as many car stereos have nowadays) to reduce the dynamic range for in-car listening. However, the record companies know not everyone has a 'Loud' button or knows how to use it so perhaps this is just one more reason they're killing dynamic range in their products.",1236345341

In every single case we've won, even when the disputes were against lawyers for their fees.

Yet none of my friends ever carry through and seek legal justice.  I just don't understand their fear of the very simple small claims procedure.",1236344656

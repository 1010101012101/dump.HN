You can't argue with the results.<p>Just be honest: you're angry at Facebook because you think they wouldn't hire you due to your age. Just like you're angry and jealous that YC is making ""kids"" (as you call them) rich by giving them a huge headstart.<p>You indirectly compare yourself to Mozart. Claim to have an amazingly great way of developing, but of course don't say anything about it. Flatly claim Facebook developers are ""clueless"" and your methods are ""superior"". You're too much man, I already have Comedy Central.

If you had more deserved confidence in your own ability perhaps you'd see their actions differently?<p>pg's articles talk to ""normal"" people all the time.",1179314353

Do you know of a service that does this? ...'</i><p>No but there are plenty of aggregation sites that collect third party contributions via RSS or ATOM.  I was thinking about this the other day (how do you gather contributions to sites uniformly) and came to a number of conclusions:<p>- standardised way of presenting/marking up a contribution<p>- easy way for companies to implement this painlessly <p>- some way to extract this information from many sites<p>The conclusion is if you want lots of companies to add this one approach would be to design, spec a microformat ( <a href=""http://microformats.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microformats.org</a> ) allowing sites to markup contributions easily in a standardised format. The data could then be mined without little effort from the third party company<p>SERVER SIDE<p>Each contribution could be marked up in a site allowing where a user is identified. Then A) a user to be identified, B) users contribution is marked up C) contribution meta-data can be marked up.<p>CLIENT SIDE<p>Read a site, parse the page markup looking for contribution data.<p>THIRD PARTY SITE<p>Allow users to register and list sites they have contributed content. The site then checks the third party sites, checks if the user is valid and extracts the contribution markup on these sites. The aggregation of contributions for many users could then be displayed, exported etc.<p>The idea of collecting contribution data relies on using a public standard tag (micro format) markup that third party sites could apply, users individually extract and more importantly allow third party companies to harvest.",1179314147

However, I don't think that's a bad thing;  that's part of the benefit of being in a good beneficial club, just like any society.<p>Cure it of that and it will be the lesser for it.",1179314012

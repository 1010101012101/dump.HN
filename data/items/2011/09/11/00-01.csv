For the longest time, I swore by Visual Studio + Visual Assist X for JS development - it's a weird combination, but the inline autocomplete was the best at the time.<p>Once VS started getting slow, I spent a lot of time looking around for JS IDEs - my main criteria was learning speed of the autocomplete system. If I typed something as simple as:<p><pre><code>  function A() {\n    this.brains = function(x, y) {}\n  }\n  A.prototype.branola = function(x, y) {}\n  var a = new A();\n  a.br\n</code></pre>\nI expected the 'brains'/'branola' autocomplete to automatically appear inline. PyCharm/WebStorm was the only one that did this quickly. Others either couldn't do it, took forever, had keypress-based autocomplete, or just offended me in random other ways. Even IntelliJ, PyCharm's bigger and crazier sibling, was too slow (and seemed to lack the ability to just open a folder and have that be your project).<p>In more recent versions, they integrated VCS into the editor, so you could see your delta lines, and use keypresses for viewing and jumping between your uncommitted edits (which is the most ridiculously useful thing that no-one but me seems to want).",1315702403

2982893,comment,2982282,2982282,7,0,Read_the_Genes,,,"Thank you for linking to this interesting discussion on Reddit.  Their discussion lacks a few key points.<p>First, inflammation is an important cause of cellular (and DNA) damage.  The standard weapon used by your innate immune system is super-oxide, a free radical!  Avoiding chronic infections is likely to be an important key to longevity, especially for those prone to inflammation.<p>Second, while ""aging"" is a natural mechanism by which your body defends against cancer, ""aging"" quickly is not the ideal way to prevent cancer.<p>Your cells will stop dividing when they have reached their Hayflick limit.  This limit is not exactly caused by telomeres, but rather the lack of telomerase (a protein that lengthens telomeres). Active telomerase is necessary for a cell to become cancerous.<p>So the cell has its own built in mechanism to determine when it has divided too many times, as well as when it has accumulated DNA damage from external sources like UV or oxides.  Your cells have ""aged"" when they have accumulated too much DNA damage!  So aging, in this sense, is not a good way to prevent cancer.  The aged body is filled with tumors that are near metastasis, and undergoes drastic changes (eg. reduction in hormones) to prevent cancer formation.<p>The only real way to prevent cancer is to stop cell division.  This, of course, is not ideal.  How would we grow to become an adult without cell division?  How would we heal damaged tissue?  The answer is actually in the growth pathways of mammals.<p>It turns out that dwarfs (little people) have very low cancer rates.  See for example:\n<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=defective-growth-gene-in-dwarfism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=defective-g...</a><p>These people lack a gene (in a pathway) that is necessary for cancer to form.  Knocking out genes in growth pathways in mice drastically reduces their cancer rates (the mice are also small).  Want to prevent cancer? Stop growing!<p>This is completely unrealistic, of course.  However, populations with limited activity in their growth pathways will be less prone to cancer.  This extends to short people too, not just dwarfs.",1315701809

These allow the creation of other tools that build upon the basic tools: filtering, transformation, reduction, unions, differences, etc. I have this rich toolset for working with lists because lists are a standard datatype; if the syntax for expressing a list were different for every list I wanted to work with, none of these tools could exist.<p>The 'meaning' of the list, within the context of a specific API, is of course specific to that API. That's the semantic meaning I've been mentioning. My ideal is where you only need to document the semantic meaning, and not the syntax that is used to represent that meaning.

Also, the VIM plugin is pretty unstable and creates weird input focus bugs (where I click on one pane and start typing only to have characters appear in another pane).<p>That said, PyCharm is worth it, even with some pain.

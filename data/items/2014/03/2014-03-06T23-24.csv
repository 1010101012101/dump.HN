Both virtual and that one Satoshi-s are said to be worried about anonimity, using VPN to send emails, etc. And yet it is said he used his <i>real name</i> all this time. And being discovered only now by some journalist. Seriously, it is weird just by itself, not mentioning all these little discrepancies in their appearing personalities.<p>And both &quot;Satoshi&quot; and &quot;Nakamoto&quot; are fairly common japanese name and surname by the way, so I doubt if this one is really the only programmer Satoshi Nakamoto.",1394150379

And have lost customers in the process, since any customer info stored at the gateway is lost and getting hundreds of people to re-type their billing info in is a big undertaking and a big pain.<p>The cost of &quot;hopping gateways&quot; for any SaaS has little to do with the cost of the gateway or the cost of development. It&#x27;s all about customer retention.<p>When I left one merchant account provider which had ratcheted up its rates every month for years to the point that continuing with them was absurd, the gateway refused to provide my customer info to me or transfer it to a new provider. It simply wasn&#x27;t mine to have, in their view. That will never happen again; even if I leave Spreedly, they will give me the info to take with me.<p>> They charge 2 cents on top of gateway fees<p>Whether it&#x27;s a $29/month customer or a $2000/month customer, 2 pennies just doesn&#x27;t register. Let&#x27;s say I have 500 customers that get charged each month. That&#x27;s $10/month in transaction fees from Spreedly. That would buy me... 2 more ad clicks from Google.

I have found that does not slow down my work at all.<p>Shifting globally will be replaced with a lot of automation. A lot of lower tech jobs were temporarily shifted to countries with cheaper labor. I&#x27;ve got news for you, if your job is simple enough to be performed by cheaper labor, then it&#x27;s simple enough for a shell script. After our company shifted 10k+ US help desk jobs to India, a year later I created the automation that put the 15k Indians out of work (payback is a bi$%^).<p>Now, I work for a cloud based company. The technological shift now means that automation I had to create from scratch to automate the build of a system has become much more common place. AWS, for example, has API&#x27;s to interact with their services, build new servers, monitor, etc. There&#x27;s Chef, Knife, Ansible and a million other tools to perform tasks. You still need someone who understands the underlying technology and principals, as there are gaps between what the automation does, and what humans are capable of. There&#x27;s also gaps between pieces of automation.<p>There&#x27;s talk of programmer jobs being automated. When I hear that, I think of the contrast between developers that use WYSIWYG editors or IDE&#x27;s, versus developers that code from text editors or VIM.<p>Sure, in MS Visual Studio, you can drag and drop complex elements into a GUI layout, and they&#x27;ll work to a certain extent. The code underneath is proprietary, fugly and filled with unnecessary bloat. They try to put everything in, in case you need it later. And of course, as a developer, you have to understand how to hook them all together and make it work. It&#x27;s not magic, and not even close to automation. At best, it&#x27;s assembly line production. There&#x27;s less consideration over performance and efficiency of the code - all they care about are the widgets.<p>A developer who uses text editors becomes much more proficient, writes leaner, better code, and understands the processes behind the widget much better.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer, you&#x27;ll likely always be in demand. If you&#x27;re worried about automation taking your place, I&#x27;d advise becoming the automator. You will never be short of work.",1394149731

It just so happens that the prime numbers are precisely the natural numbers with this property. It&#x27;s fine to define prime numbers that way, but in more general contexts a prime element is actually an element p which cannot divide a product of two elements a.b without dividing one (or both) of them. It just so happens that the non-invertible natural numbers with this property also aren&#x27;t able to be written as a product p = c.d such that c != 1 and d != 1.

I am ready to start implementing tests, and I think that as was stated above, tautological unit tests has no value, unless something inside it may be suspectible to change. When you write a unit test, then you add cohesiveness, so you have to update the unit test when your interface change. In other words. You don&#x27;t write any regression test before your interface is stable. -On the other hand, you may use that same test as a test driven development test up to that point, and let the test be the manifesto of the specification. For simpler cases, it is often best to use assertions, that you can annhilate when you ship anyway. Apple says that Unit tests are for the model more than the view, but may be used in the controller, so those places I am inclined to use NSAssert. I don&#x27;t have to throw away unit tests that takes a long time to run in Xcode either, as I can just disable them.<p>I must also say that I am reluctant to write large tests, and &quot;mock objects&quot; to provider large environments for the code to run in, as that may introduce new bugs and more work.<p>I guess (hope) the correct stratagems for when to implement tests, and when not comes with experience!",1394148280

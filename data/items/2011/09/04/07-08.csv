Apart from making these issues more visible, the upside to fixing an accessibility issue goes way up because now you have something embarrassing in your SERP for all to see instead of a few disgruntled non-customers.",1315123180

The details of that preference are complex and can take some time to fully understand. Things like double-dipping (owning a liquidation preference and THEN participating on the same percentage os a common stock holder) make it even more complex.<p>The key thing to know is that not all stock is the same. ""Owning"" 1% of the company doesn't mean you get 1% of the exit necessarily.<p>In smaller exits those liquidation preferences can mean that the investors are paid out and nothing is left of the pie for you.<p>A good article on this:<p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/what-are-the-terms-part1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/what-are-the-terms-part1.h...</a>",1315123053

If the PlusFeed fellow got 2.7 working, we'd expect to see 100/3.5%= 28 in-flight requests. Do you have data on how big the base memory vs per-thread memory requirements of these apps are? Python isn't famous for freeing up memory.<p>Which is to say, do you have any solid numbers that tell us that when we switch to 2.7, you wont have exactly the same memory pressure and either have to up the instance-hour cost, or start charging for ram, or just limit in-flight request to 3 or 4 so that our costs are only 5 times as much instead of 20?<p>Bottom line: what we all woke up to is that fact that as of right now:<p>* <i>you</i> set the price of an instance, <i>and</i><p>* <i>you</i> get to decide how many instances I'm going to pay you for<p>Some of us are thinking that while that was a great idea when engineers were in charge, its not such a great idea now the bean-counters have taken over.",1315121759

2959001,comment,2957335,2957848,1,0,wisty,,,"A slight modification to your tldr (it's a little confusing to me as I'm not so familiar with unicode):<p>Basically, they use count code points, not UTF-8 bytes.<p>Before they count the code points, they normalize using the Normalization Form C of Unicode (NFC), which aims to combine diacritics, so the """" in ""caf"" counts as 1 code point. If they used NFD to normalize, """" would be normalized into 2 code points - ""e"" and a diacritic mark. If they didn't normalize, then it would be client dependent.<p>Normalization is distinct from encoding. A unicode string can be normalized in several different ways (including NFC and NFD), which changes the actual unicode code-points). Each normalized form can be encoded using several different encodings (i.e. utf-8, utf-32, latin1, etc). Normalization affects both the number of code points, and subsequently the number of bytes. Encoding (unicode -> bytes) changes the number of bytes, but should <i>not</i> affect the number of code points - code points should not be influenced by the encoding.<p>Recapping - Twitter does not count bytes. They count code points, after the code points have been normalized (combining diacritics with characters), so message length should not depend on the client.<p>Hmm, that wasn't so succinct.",1315120674

By powers, I mean that in the mathematical sense. For a network of N nodes, the examples above have some network effect of N^1.3 or N+log(N), but I think ebay is closer to N^2 or greater...<p>The only way around ebay will be to somehow go around the edges (aggregation?) or fight a long hard battle against them with a superior product. I do think someone can take them out, but it will not be easy. ",1185329947

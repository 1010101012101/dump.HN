8610779,comment,8609040,8610747,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"It used to be possible to pair Glass with a bluetooth keyboard, and there are some very nice keyboards on the market which fold up to about the size of a cell phone, and unfold to about the size of a normal laptop keyboard. This is as good as a laptop keyboard if you put it on a table, pretty good if you rest it on your lap, and passable walking around if you hold your thumbs on the bottom to stabilize it while typing with the other eight fingers. The main caveats are that the Glass screen isn&#x27;t very high resolution, so you can&#x27;t get much more than 80x25, and it&#x27;s not very usable while walking around even if you can manage to type, because head-vibration makes small text unreadable.<p>Unfortunately, this is impossible in versions of Glass since XE16 (April), and fraught with difficulty in the version before that (XE12, where dialog boxes don&#x27;t work, so you need a modified SSH client and a modified Settings app to pair). I also had to modify the ssh client to fix some keybindings, and to add a left-margin because my device was missing 4 columns of pixels on the left edge. When it works, it&#x27;s significantly better than ssh on a phone, because you can use a real keyboard without needing three hands or a surface to put things on. It&#x27;s less nice than a computer, mainly because of the low screen resolution.",1416023578

We almost always require the language aspect of programming to communicate with computer hardware. It is a link for compiling syntax between both the human mind and the computer mind. We need a common means to compile information, just like communicating ideas between people. Programming languages are exactly the same thing as traditional spoken language.<p>I&#x27;ll argue that to parse any language requires a specific cognitive skill.

8610774,comment,8610129,8610129,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"<i>All</i> components of a quantum system are always entangled.  It&#x27;s not some mysterious property that arises under unusual circumstances.  In fact, I would argue that quantum entanglement is <i>the</i> defining feature of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical mechanics.<p>However, the way that most articles (and even physicists) use the term &quot;entanglement&quot; is in a loose way.  Within a good approximation, a multi-component quantum state can be represented as a tensor product of single component quantum states.  When this isn&#x27;t a good approximation anymore, you can say that the entanglement of the system is much more apparent.<p>To give an example of what I mean, there&#x27;s a technique in quantum chemistry known as density functional theory (DFT), which is used to compute ground state energies of various molecules.  For some molecules, it works pretty well.  The benefit of DFT is that it is a fast calculation technique (well, as far as quantum chemistry goes), but it&#x27;s speed comes at a price.  Rather than using the Coulombic interaction of every pair of electrons to compute the energy of a molecule (or more technically, using every Coulombic interaction as terms in the Hamiltonian), a probability cloud of electron positions is computed instead, and this cloud is used as the energetic term.<p>This works really well for a lot of systems, but in some cases (superconductors, metals, solid-state physics, van der Waals interactions), this approximation falls apart because the effect of electron-electron correlation significantly affects the energy of the system.  In this case, the full, non-separable wavefunction is required.  The fact that this full wavefunction cannot easily be broken into an approximation of simpler, single electron wavefunctions means that the entanglement of the system is very apparent.",1416023422

spent so many days thinking about the treatment of 
psychiatric disorders;  it literally gives me a headache.
I agree that Psychiatry is still in the Dark Ages(not figuratively, but in some ways so close to the right period 
in time it&#x27;s humorous.)  I won&#x27;t state what I was diagnosed with, but what I will disclose is it came on one Christmas 
Eve and went on for Years.  I tried all the tri, and heterocyclic drugs.  They all failed spectacularly.   The 
only reprieve I have gotten over the years are highly addictive drugs.  I now just try to keep the dosage low because I know if my current doctor retires; I&#x27;ll have a 
hard time getting these drugs, or run out of money paying out of pocket for unnesarry office visits.  I don&#x27;t blame 
the Psychiatrists--that is the Psychiatrists who don&#x27;t call
themselfs &quot;Specialist in Psychotropic Drugs&quot;, or a dude who 
charged $400.00/hr for dubious advice and medication.  Who 
I do blame are the Drug companies and their oh so carefully 
designed Double Blind Placebo Controlled studies.  Studies 
which were pimped out to the cheapest Ho(country).  Studies
that were cherry picked in order to show the FDA their dubious drug worked slightly over Placebo.  Studies that didn&#x27;t exclude early Placebo responders.  Studies that didn&#x27;t account for subjects who felt the side effects and attributed to the Placebo Cure.  And--my last gripe; Studies 
that didn&#x27;t really use subjects who were clinically ill.
Yes--they were poor, and many times Homeless, but they really didn&#x27;t have a malfunction in their brain.(Yes--they 
might have had symptoms out of DSM-5, but because of their 
predicament many of their symptoms could be accounted for.)
While I&#x27;m on the soap box, I&#x27;ll pass this along.  I&#x27;m not 
sure this s the truth, but it came from a good source.  It 
is this;  I was told that Fluoxetine(Prosac) showed so little promise it was &quot;shelved&quot; for years until some MBA 
in Business decided to he could market a cureall drug--that 
is if the researchers played along?",1416022995

Turns out that if your language consisted entirely of unnamed lambda functions, it would still be turing-complete because you could use one of several types of combinators to implement everything else. The Y combinator and a few other similar ones implement recursion, which is quite a feat for such a limited language.<p>Mathematical terminology exists only to add precision to human languages, which are notoriously vague. It can be overdone, of course. Polyvariadic is a bit silly, it just means that the combinator has been generalized so that it works on functions which have more than one argument (literally &quot;many-variable-having&quot;); the original Lambda Calculus pared away even that to leave just functions of one argument.<p>That hypothetical language, btw, is called the Lambda Calculus.

This has sucked much (though not all) of the best technical talent (and worse, tech-savvy managers) out of the public sector. Without a critical mass, all of your really skilled geeks in government find it almost impossible to advocate for the right answer, and the policy makers and supervisors are usually not able to tell the difference between the right answer and other, non-feasible, courses of action proposed by the unskilled geeks in government.<p>To top that off, when the government can&#x27;t build things using civil servants alone they have to fall back to contractors, but our contracting processes are so insane that it doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that our government contracting officers find it impossible to hire and oversee the best companies to deliver and maintain a working project.

The scientist is physically prevented from making the &quot;wrong&quot; choice when setting the detector.<p>The problem with this hypothesis is that it seems essentially untestable.<p>Another way to think of option 2 is that the universe is 100% deterministic. Under this hypothesis, the speed of entanglement is only apparent, not real--like planning with a friend to both turn on your flashlights on opposite hilltops 2 hours from now. Without knowing that it was planned in advance, an observer would wonder how you reacted to one another so fast.<p>This is also impossible to fully test; at best you could prove that the consistency extends as far back as we can see into the past.

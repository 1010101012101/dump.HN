The entrepreneurial world is a brutal one and you want as many people on your side as possible.<p>Because I live in Colorado (but go to college in Austin), I'm surprised I hadn't heard about this before -- despite it launching about 4 months ago. Boulder is an awesome town, and you have the Rocky Mountains all around.<p>Regardless of the detrimental effect the attraction of nearby ski resorts could have on a startup (which also makes it a great place to live), I feel that Denver's/Boulder's weakness is that there aren't universities with better computer science programs. All the major startup hubs have excellent universities nearby whose talent they can feed off of:<p>Cambridge: MIT, Harvard
Silicon Valley: Stanford, Berkeley
Seattle: University of Washington
Austin: University of Texas<p>(Darn -- After visiting PG's website, I realize I am re-iterating what he says this in his essay, ""How To Be Silicon Valley."")<p>I can see this first-hand, attending the University of Texas. I've interviewed with many startups, and you can see how they're student quality is evident in the company's work.<p>I would imagine this is true even moreso in the better CS programs like MIT and Stanford, and double that with towns that have two great programs.",1174974964
6554,comment,6551,6551,0,0,brett,,,"It's interesting that this write up is not as negative as it could be. For a phone service some of the failures he mentions are pretty bad. Is Arrington pulling punches because he's already been positive?<p>Arrington claims people expecting Grand Central to do what is says are putting too much faith in a beta product. What you can get away with has a lot to do with your offering. I'm not going to stop watching justin.tv because it's down (like right now, completely dead). But I'm not sure if beta is a good enough excuse for me to miss calls from clients. Especially now that beta is ubiquitous and virtually meaningless. Gmail certainly would not be off the hook for losing my emails. Is it really just caveat emptor for beta products as he suggests?",1174974253
6553,comment,6456,6501,0,0,paul,,,"As I've gotten older, one thing I've learned is that some thoughts are best kept to yourself (or those you trust), even if they are true.  :)<p>Publicly suggesting that you hire based on age isn't especially brilliant.<p>In Mark's defense, I thought that he might really be trying to say that younger people are systematically undervalued, and so hiring them is a bargain. (the market has under-priced their work) Of course I'm sure that others think that the opposite is true and that older people are under-priced. Obviously those people should hire the under-priced old people and build a competing social network. :)",1174974098

6545,comment,6456,6456,0,0,ericwan,,,"For Mark's comment, I think an entrepreneur over 30 would tend to ask to ""address a market"", while those under 20 tend to just build a cool thing and see if anybody is willing to pay for it. The latter is more likely to build revolutionary products because they see market needs that haven't emerged yet. Having said that, older entrepreneurs are more experience and still capable, but perhaps can only build incrementally better products.",1174972824

But, I don't think I could go and found a Kiko or a xobni(I think these are both brilliant ideas, but not every startup can work the same way).<p>Our revenue model is completely in line with this article.  We charge our customers a fair price for our service, and in return we will do just about anything to keep their business... We figure out ways to scratch their itch.    This is how I understand software.<p>If I could give advice to anyone in the process of founding a startup, it would be to do something that has revenue potential besides advertising.  If you can do something that solves someone elses business problems, it may be worth the cost of a full or part time employee for that company. ",1174971892

5545684,comment,5544010,5544243,6,0,maddalab,,,"Quote from the article<p>""Let me tell you another story: my neighbour in the upper-middle-class area where I live is a man who owns luxury hotels. His house is huge, but no sooner had he moved in than he appropriated about half of the pavement space to the front and side of his house, claiming it for his own. This means less parking for others, less pavement for children, less walking space for everyone. Of the 400-odd houses in this area, at least half have done this. At the same time they have also collectively seen off the only roadside tea stall in the area that served all the service providers  the guards, the drivers, the domestics, the sweepers. ""<p>Both the writer and you are discounting the 200 odd houses in the area that have not claimed an entitlement on the pavement, by doing so you are discrediting the willingness of those who are playing by the rules to further an argument that does no hold scrutiny. Further more as others have stated in comments, there is nothing in the article that is uniquely Indian.<p>> In India this is quite possible, a middle class person could easily hire 3-4 people and therefore start to create change.<p>Most people do not have a need to hire 3-4 people. Growing up it was common to have a maid who helped with household chores due to the absence of amenities like a dish washer or washing machine. As these services become available there is no need to hire folks to do such work. Hiring folks and having them laze around only to take home wages is a ridiculous idea, moreover wealth saved by not hiring these folks is spent on other purposes (movies, restaurants etc.) that the so called wealth might consider a good return on investment. These in turn create jobs for services that are required (taxi drivers, ticket vendors, waiters, restaurant managers etc.). The fact that the so called upper class people do not hire folks to do their dishes and laundry is if anything a move towards a society with fewer artificial classes.",1365908384

He's obviously got some of the skills - he may not be the best, but he'll be worth hiring.<p>If you're a non-technical person looking to hire technical people, you're fighting an uphill battle.  First, technical people are currently in higher demand.  Its hard to find them in the first place.  Next, you have very little ability to evaluate their skills.

I used to work with an industry-specific portal that was perfected to work with said industry. Google would never be able to touch this space.<p>Despite being a smallish industry, there was two large players and few smaller players. The innovation even in such a small space was quite astounding.<p>There are definitely some areas that are too specific for Google to really work with. It is very good as a general search engine, but if your time is dependent on getting information fast in a specific industry, Google falls flat.<p>The main issue with this strategy is that you only have a small subset of the population and you have to an expert in many domains to get it right. thus, you'll never be as large or profitable as Google. Of course, you better have people to talk to on the phone. That'll kill this engine before it gets off the ground.<p>The only way I can think of toppling Google is if you created an engine that really focuses on productivity and gaining market share from the people who really need information and who are willing to pay for said information and offer them a free version that is better than their industry-specific tools, then after gaining penetration and toppling some of their industry players, branch into focusing on finding cute cat pictures and the like.

The challenge is not search per se. There are probably 100 really hard technical problems between idea and search engine infrastructure, the challenge is the ads.<p>Search engines need money to operate (we, Blekko, pay a ton of cash every month to keep our portion of a data center in Santa Clara humming) and search advertising is an excellent product, but it is also a finite market. Let me explain.<p>So lets assume for the sake of argument that the amount of money everyone in the world is willing to spend on advertising is fixed [1]. You know like $32B/year. (I don't know the actual number that is just made up for illustration). These are ""companies"" (from single users to large multi-nationals) who are willing to pay money to a person who puts their advertisement in front of a potential customer.<p>So lets say Alice at BigCorp has an advertising budget of $1M/year. Maybe she is going to buy a TV spots with most of that and spend $100K on ""Internet"" advertising. She can either talk to a bunch of ""properties"" (which is what she would have done in 1995) or she will buy ads on ""Google"" which means they might pop up on AdSense for Content pages, or via AdWords in various searches, perhaps on your Gmail window, or your News feed. And she'll only pay for them when they get clicked on and she'll use her analytics to try to figure out how ""impactful"" that was. Or maybe she only has a $100 Ad budget and she will blow it all on AdWords for putting her ad on search queries that people might make when they were looking for her business.<p>The small search engine is at a disadvantage, not from a technology perspective (the searches can be better than Google's pretty easily for highly contested searches) but from a <i>revenue capture</i> perspective.<p>What is worse, bad advertising networks are <i>really</i> bad, they can serve up malware as a number of popular blogs have discovered. So people who are very brand conscious or burned by a bad ad network will shy away from those networks, making non-Google networks less effective (fewer advertisers so less competition for ad insertions) and search engines that use them get commensurately less revenue per thousand searches.<p>The one redeeming factor is that when you have the ability to crawl and index enough of the web, <i>that asset</i> gives you the ability to do some very interesting things. Fortunately things that others will pay for (because neither Google nor Microsoft/Bing will give you access to their index). The down side its not as lucrative (on a $ per kilo-core-cluster millisecond level) as running the combination of the worlds most used search engine feeding you the worlds most used advertising network.<p>If you ever had any doubt, Google's advertising business funds them like Microsoft's Office business funds Microsoft. If you ever split Google in two where its ads business offered services to anyone on a non-discriminatory nature, the world would be a more interesting place (and there would be several really interesting search engines with their own editorial slant, not just a few)<p>[1] This is largely true, although the ""growth"" in Internet advertising revenues has shown up as a decrease in other media advertising. From newspapers to radio those ad dollars are shifting to the net but the overall size of the pie is constant or shrinking slightly according to Advertising Age (<a href=""http://adage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/</a>)",1365907517

We often point to those who have been successful for a long period of time as an example that it is possible to beat the system, but that analysis fails to account for the other end of the probability distribution: those who have failed for a long period of time (or failed so hard early that they had to get out of the game).<p>In other words, for every big winner, there is a big loser. The fact that some people win or lose can (mostly) be explained by randomness (or cheating).<p>But Kahneman & Tversky's stunning finding with Financial Advisors, and humans in general, is that those who are successful attribute their success mostly to skill, hard work, etc, while failing to adequately acknowledge how large a role chance played. For the humble, this is not a problem, but for the arrogant or uninformed, this can easily turn into entitlement.<p>(BTW I definitely believe that, in most fields, a person needs to meet certain thresholds of hard work, energy, intelligence, etc. to be successful, but the level of success after reaching those thresholds is largely a function of chance.)<p>We humans are very good at drawing false conclusions from random data. Have you watched a basketball game recently? If a good shooter misses a couple free throws, commentators seem obligated to explain that the reason for this is fatigue, or poor form, or this, or that. How about the fact that it just randomly happens sometimes?<p>Applying this thinking to Indian elites: they have a lot of money, probably through their families or their own success. They believe their status is well deserved and earned, either because of superior genetics or superior skills (or any other number of reasons), and as a result, the uninformed feel entitled (and act accordingly). The author's anecdotal examples aside, this is no different than how many (but not all!) people behave on Wall Street, in athletics, at the high levels of corporations, etc. This is not an Indian problem, or an elite problem; it's a human problem.<p>Fooled by Randomness[2].

I saw a fascinating presentation a couple of years back* by the guy who built this: <a href=""http://maps.spench.net/aviation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.spench.net/aviation/</a> (requires the Google Earth browser plugin). He's using the Universal SDR (software defined radio) to listen to various bits of telemetry coming down from commercial airliners (including, amusingly, automated reports from toilet failures!) and plotting in real time all the planes he's detecting data from. He's using ~$800 worth of radio hardware to recieve those transmissions, but you can listen in on those bands for a lot less using something like this: <a href=""http://www.funcubedongle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.funcubedongle.com/</a> - and I've heard talk about re-purposed USB cableTV dongles being useable down in the ~$30 price range.<p>What the USDR can do that the cheaper receivers can't though, is _transmit_ on those bands. Hearing how readily Balint decoded the ModeS data, I'm 100% sure that a technically competent but not-very-sophisticated attacker could very easily transmit their own data on those channels using a USDR with the appropriate TX daughterboard (and, in the context of the original article, could easily control the USDR transmitter with an Android app).<p>(I do vaguely wonder whether any of the radio hardware in a typical Android device is ""universal"" enough to be convinced to transmit on the bands required here - I'm not quite enough of a radio-geek to know and/or go looking right now. I _strongly_ suspect not, and that if the original article has kernels of truth in it, it's referring to external transmitters controlled by an Android app)<p>* <a href=""http://spench.net/drupal/video/mode-s-dorkbot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spench.net/drupal/video/mode-s-dorkbot</a>",1365905564

408302,comment,407787,407787,0,0,owkaye,,,"We developed a business specifically to take advantage of the fact that we're in a depression.  It's not that hard to do when you think about it for a while, and re-adjust your 'thinking cap'.  Unfortunately it seems that many people don't have this ability.  Maybe they are so used to thinking about how to make money in a growing economy that it is totally foreign to them to think about how to do it in a depression. Our model may not last for more than a few years but it has the potential to generate so much income in those few short years that it's crazy not to do it.<p>Our concept uses the internet as a marketing tool but it is in no way an exclusive internet business model, nor it is yet another lame non-business hobby like most of the 'social networking' site a lot of naive and inexperienced kids are putting online these days.<p>I'm 52 years old and have decades of experience with a variety of different startups, internet and non-internet, and all of them my own concepts and ideas.  My partners in this new venture are equally experienced in the 'real world' as well as in the virtual world. This kind of experience is invaluable, and it is also something that appears to be sorely lacking in the internet startup world today, at least in terms of the ridiculous new startups I hear about in this forum.<p>Our new business solves a real world problem, it's not out there trying to sponge off facebook or twitter or any of the other throw-away efforts of the ""Web 2.0 generation"" by re-factoring info others provide.  I cannot imagine the whining we're going to hear from all the 'me too' kids out there who have no better ideas than to latch onto the shirttails of companies that have no revenue model and are therefore destined for oblivion in the next few years!<p>If you're thinking of a startup here's my advice: Instead of trying to find and solve problems in people's virtual lives, just pay attention to the problems they are having in the REAL WORLD -- in their actual day-to-day lives aside from the internet -- and you may come up with a genuine business model that will make you a millionaire or better.<p>And if you want to keep your current job or get a better one, start now by re-dedicating yourself to performing faster, smarter and better on the job you already have.  Then maybe your current employer will have a reason to keep you around after he lays off everyone else.  And your next employer will see something unique and valuable in you compared with all the clowns who make almost no effort to improve their on-the-job performance, and instead do as little as possible for the money their employers are willing to pay them.<p>Set yourself apart from everyone else, not only on the job but in your off-work time as well.  Show yourself and the rest of the world that you're willing to try harder, improve more, and become truly valuable to this world.  Don't be a leech or a sponge because they suck the lives out of others.  Instead become energizing, overflowing and powerful.<p>Do everything the best you possibly can, or don't do it at all, that's the bottom line.",1230079930

I watch literally almost everything through my Xbox 360 now. It's even beat out my plans to get a Mac Mini to do the job, and even better it's capable of pushing at 720p for the same price.<p>Before I got the 360 I was struggling with DVD's and usually resorting to watching video off my media laptop. I'm hoping Hulu starts allowing their content in Canada so I can stream shows from the internet through TVersity.<p>I have a Wii, but I've found the 360 winning a lot more play time over the Wii mainly because of the mature games on the console and the fact it works as a DVD player and media center just kicks the Wii when it's down.<p>I bought a 360 elite, I see that the Arcade version isn't as bad of a deal as I originally thought it would be. Although I think they should have gone with a 12gb SSD over a memory card, but that's from someone who filled up 20 gigs of my Xbox's HDD in about a week when I first got the console.<p>IMO I'd say the Xbox isn't the best selling console out there, but for gamers it's got the best content (having stolen a lot of exclusives from the PS3 like Final Fantasy); it's also a great media center (amazing when you download TVersity), both of which mean it's going to stay as close to the TV as your VCR used to (at least I know it will in my house).",1230078526

And you suffer from the same malady that infects every human being.

Many, many arms. None of us is entirely free from it. We may deny it. We try to suppress it. We build a whole culture around hiding from it, pretending it is not there, and distracting ourselves from it with goals and projects and status. But it never goes away. It is a constant undercurrent in every thought and every perception; a little wordless voice at the back of the head saying, ""Not good enough yet. Got to have more. Got to make it better. Got to be better."" It is a monster, a monster that manifests everywhere in subtle forms.<p>Go to a party. Listen to the laughter, that brittle-tongued voice that says fun on the surface and fear underneath. Feel the tension, feel the pressure. Nobody really relaxes. They are faking it. Go to a ball game. Watch the fan in the stand. Watch the irrational fit of anger. Watch the uncontrolled frustration bubbling forth from people that masquerades under the guise of enthusiasm, or team spirit. Booing, cat-calls and unbridled egotism in the name of team loyalty. Drunkenness, fights in the stands. These are the people trying desperately to release tension from within. These are not people who are at peace with themselves. Watch the news on TV. Listen to the lyrics in popular songs. You find the same theme repeated over and over in variations.

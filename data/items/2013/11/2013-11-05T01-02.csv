  Bill Clinton believes in bureaucratic micro-management of 
  the information economy. Within his first 100 days as 
  President, Bill Clinton proposed the Clipper Chip -- a 
  secret government-controlled encryption algorithm -- and a 
  companion key escrow system where two government agencies 
  would hold a copy of the keys for every Clipper user. Since 
  then Bill Clinton has released updated versions of 
  encryption proposals which insist that the government hold 
  a key to individual&#x27;s private data communications.</code></pre>",1383616772

It seems to have a very real business model that is powered by very real and powerful engagement metrics. Pinterest could very well be as solid as facebook.<p>Why does Pinterest need $400M in venture to operate? Lets ask ourselves why a glorified status feed, Twitter, needs over 100 engineers. Why does Twitter need to rewrite almost every aspect of real-time stream processing? Because there is huge value there, and at that scale I&#x27;m sure the financials look a lot different from your weekend web app.<p>Back to snapchat, this tech doomsday bubble, everyone is parrotting is a single lone horse in what are many successful and sustainable companies such as DropBox, Uber, RocketFuel and Square. And its not like snapchat is an imaginary app. Snapchat shares over 350M photos a day, people aren&#x27;t lining up and seeing snapchat success overnight.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble seeing that the current tech industry is in a &quot;bubble&quot; when the only evidence for it is that SnapChat, with an incredibly huge userbase, is raising ~3B.

People <i>are</i> working on it.  The problem is that nobody can fix the problem all at once, and so in the process of creating new winners, they also create new losers.<p>Think about it this way: YC did not exist 8 years ago.  There was no way for someone like the Reddit founders or Brian Chesky of AirBnB to create their companies; after all, they lacked connections too.  There was no way for people to gain income by renting out their spare rooms (I have at least one friend who is financially kept afloat by this).<p>But when you solve <i>that</i> problem, you leave behind all the other folks who think they could also found a billion-dollar company, if only given the chance, but for whatever reason don&#x27;t make it into YC.  And so they get bitter and complain about how unfair the world is.  Which is true; their number didn&#x27;t come up on the dice, but complaining about it is not doing themselves any favors.<p>Keep in mind that people are upset because one rich kid will get to pay $20K to go to a YC dinner, while a couple poor kids get scholarships to attend an elite private school they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to go to.  This is about as close to a strictly-positive-for-everyone deal as possible.<p>I think that one of the deepest flaws of our species is that we measure ourselves by relative accomplishment instead of absolute accomplishment.  If you are reading Hacker News, you are probably in the top 1% by opportunities available worldwide.

    Bob Dole is concerned about children accessing unsuitable material when using the Internet. But strict censorship of the Internet is not the answer. Bob Dole believes that parents should take responsibility for the material that their children view, and he wants to encourage technology which allows those decisions to be made within each home.

    Throughout his Senate career, Bob Dole has fought to protect the Constitutional liberty of Americans:
    Bob Dole is a supporter of the Pro-CODE bill that limits the federal government&#x27;s control of encryption and user keys. It permits the export of software that includes encryption if the software is easily available in this country.
    Bob Dole strongly supports the observations made in the recent National Research Council report that widespread use of encryption to promote information security outweighs the difficulties encrypted communications place on law enforcement. Economic espionage from foreign countries and companies is a serious threat, and Bob Dole believes Americans should have the right to guard themselves using encryption.
    Bob Dole supported the Senate hearings on Internet copyright laws. The hearings provided suggestions from information creators, Internet and on-line service providers, librarians and Internet users on developing compromises that balance the rights and needs of all participants.
    Bob Dole fought for provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that encourage parents to take responsibility for the Internet material which their children view.
    Bob Dole helped pass the Bayh-Dole act of 1980 which helped create the biotechnology industry by allowing inventions from federal research dollars to be commercially developed.

    As President, Bob Dole will:
    Promote policies that ensure that the United States remains the world leader in technological innovation.
    Reject heavy-handed big-government regulations of cyberspace.
    Promote policies that preserve and advance the openness and decentralization of computer-based communications.
    Preserve and protect American citizens&#x27; right to privacy and the need for secure communications.</code></pre>",1383615317

Oh sure. I can&#x27;t control genetics but I can definitely try to work hard to control what is within my hands. E.g. I am of Indian cultural heritage. Both my parents are first generation and the cuisine is incredibly high fat, high carb and low protein. This simply sets the stage for obesity very easily (yes, ironical in a country of crippling poverty and starvation). That coupled with sedentary lifestyles has shown (at least in studies) that Indian Americans are [1] more prone to heart diseases than other sectors. This means unlearning the habits of an entire childhood and learning how to eat more carefully.

That, and Snapchat was the first to move to the market, giving it a huge inertial advantage over Poke.<p>The main point I wanted to make was most definitely market focused: Snapchat has built itself a user base in a market that it can&#x27;t monetize by itself. It can continue to gather users &#x27;til the end of time, but it will never be able to get any revenue from them without altering its service and driving users away. Therefore Snapchat is intrinsically worthless.<p>This is distinct from the statement that &quot;Snapchat is worthless&quot; - clearly it isn&#x27;t extrinsically worthless because it can be used as a funnel to get users to other parts of the internet that might generate revenue. So there is some basis for valuing the company.<p>The question then becomes how much is it actually worth?

Example: you pay $0.99 to be able to place a character from South Park in your Snap.<p>* High-quality snaps, that take advantage of your camera&#x27;s full resolution<p>* Sound snaps, so you can record 30 seconds of audio and send it to a friend. Great for sharing tracks you make or music you&#x27;re hearing, or just to record some idiot yelling on the bus.<p>There are many more possibilities. Snapchat can almost be thought of as a &quot;social game&quot;, a sort-of cross between FarmVille, Instagram and Twitter. You can still share basic things to your friends, but you can pay to send even better things.

One of the ways we evaluate quality of care is incidence of morbidity. How often does this patient continue to return to the hospital? This is a huge risk to physicians, in the form of a lawsuit.<p>It isn&#x27;t like there is any shortage of patients who require care.

The idea was that, given an XPath expression with several attribute selectors, it would fill in any necessary nodes to just make it happen. So you can technically chain a ton of editing commands together, by using an appropriately complex XPath expression.<p>It came out of a need to repair thousands of broken XML documents. It&#x27;s probably not very complete. It was written for one project--and though I took time to make it generalized--it didn&#x27;t make it into a key role into any other projects; I just didn&#x27;t ever again have the need to deal with XML documents on such a scale.<p>It&#x27;s actually one of the first &quot;big&quot; things I wrote out of college. I&#x27;m not too happy with some of the design right now, but the functionality has held up over the years and it&#x27;s not as shitty as some of the other code I wrote at the time. I guess I knew that a lot of the project was hinging on how easy it was to write XML documents, so I made sure I did a ton of testing to make it work.",1383613349

To see the effect, extend your argument to the extreme case of very very early valuations. You have $100k to invest, and you invest $1 each in 100k companies, each with a 1 in a billion chance of being a billion dollar company. Though your expected value is the same, at the end of the year, most likely you have no money left to invest for next year. The same effect holds in less extreme cases--if you increase your variance and lose 50% of your money, you can't just make it back by having a 50% upswing the next year--you need a 100% return to recoup it.

164296,comment,164014,164146,0,0,indiejade,,,"Interesting question.  I think the ""lack of identity"" to which you refer has greatly contributed to the rise of Telecom and Internet giants.  Also has it likely played a significant part in the erosion of Net Neutrality.  There are still far too many corporate-centric entities which control or wish to control and influence what is or becomes popular or noted in traditional media outlets (television, radio, cable, etc.)<p>Traditional media relies upon what marketing people call ""push advertising"" where people are encouraged to take what is being said in the commercial/infomercial as fact.  The  Internet, however, is literally able to generate its own ""pull advertising"" as it enables people to participate and research between or among alternatives.  Think of the Mac VS PC VS Linux spoofs.  Apple spends zillions of dollars in advertising (which is one of the reasons their products are so expensive!) and many PC manufacturers do, too (""Dude!  You're getting a Dell).  But Linux doesn't have any advertising, really . . . (Novell does not count), but that hasn't prevented it from gaining momentous adoption in recent years.<p>But anyway, before going too off-topic:<p>Maybe it's not that strong identity should have been ""included in the first place,"" but that the infrastructure could have been planned better to include room for a more equitable exchange among ""providers"" and ""producers"" and ""consumers"".  After all, it's not like the ISPs or Internet giants are actually the entities _producing_ most of what is interesting or useful on the web. Of course, those touting themselves as ""providers"" would like most people to equate them and pay them as  ""producers"" and such.",1208279186

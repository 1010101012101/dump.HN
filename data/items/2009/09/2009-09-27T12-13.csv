I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor.” -- Nikola Tesla<p>Edit:  Please note that I have quoted Edison many times when encouraging people to not give up in the face of failure.  So I am not against the idea that one needs to keep working at some things.  But the idea of ""keeping at it"" can be a trap that prevents you from reassessing your approach and finding something better.",1254055545
846796,comment,846579,846579,0,0,wglb,,,"This is a good article, and as a person who works long hours, I would like to suggest a distinction.  If you are very into what you are doing, long hours do not seem ""hard"". Hard in the article seems to include a good dose of freaking out. Lets avoid that.",1254055516

Any time I said that there are other differences between the US and other countries besides who pays the medical bills, it was largely ignored.  So I was happy to see this article -- and never mind that it is also getting ignored as there are no comments on it (other than mine now).",1254055170

846791,comment,846357,846357,0,0,antirez,,,"To work hard is the only way to build great things. You can get rich by accident, but you can't build <i>great things</i> by accident. Only working hard.<p>Still it is very important to realize that it's better to improve the quality of your work and work 6/8 hours a day and find the time to relax and enjoy the life. To work very well and focused for 6 hours a day without interruptions I think can be considered to work hard as much as working 12 hours a day with a lot of breaks, environmental noise, and so on.<p>Usually I work from home, but I have a company with five people working together with me, and from time to time I go to work on the office in order to organize the work, solve the hardest tech problems, and so forth. When I'm at the office I'm a lot less focused because I receive many questions, I can't just have my usual working patterns, and my productivity is something like 20% compared to my working at home productivity.",1254054714

846788,comment,846699,846699,0,0,btn,,,"<i>And I am absolutely sure that if we got rid of patents tomorrow innovation wouldn’t be reduced at all</i><p>I don't think this is true at all. While most of the bad press about software patents comes from frivolous patents and companies that troll with their portfolios, that doesn't mean there are no <i>legitimate</i> software patents.<p>Consider the patents held by MPEG LA (MPEG codecs, Firewire, H.264, etc.) These patents represent years of R&D work by their member companies and describe inventions that are non-frivolous. Surely these companies deserve some kind of protection for their work to encourage them to continue to invest in such research and publish it.<p>One of the difficulties in the software patents issue is where to draw the line---how to define what is a ""software patent"" and what defines the patentability of inventions in that class. The debate on software patents is shifting more towards this issue, and articles that make sweeping statements like ""software/internet/hardware patents have no benefit to society and should be abolished"" add nothing to it.",1254054417
846787,comment,846357,846591,0,0,j_baker,,,"Might I suggest starting an additional thread whenever a change like this happens?  There's a certain point beyond which I quit reading comments in a single thread.  If I saw a thread on the front page that said something like ""we're using orange dots to keep track of scores"", I'd have been a lot less confused.",1254054369
846786,comment,846579,846579,0,0,Ardit20,,,"That's so dumb. Of course you need to work on the right thing. I'm actually confused. She mentions Edison and how he has tried so many experiments and fails, suggests that he worked hard, yet seems to imply that his hard work was somewhat irrelevant. He was successful because he found the right thing. I am puzzled as I am wondering whether she thinks that her readership is ten years old or have no common sense at all.<p>You need to work hard to understand the little things and incrementally advance towards the solution, or the right thing. You might discover something on a day in which you did little work, but surely you have been working for many years perhaps to arrive to that day.<p>Working hard is if anything underrated as society puts more emphasis on talent and innate ability. It is hardly over rated and as our society becomes complex by the day, it will perhaps never be overrated.",1254054287

846779,comment,846579,846579,0,0,_pius,,,"Without prejudice against her conclusions, a few things came to mind while reading this.<p>I couldn't help but think that it's easy for someone like Caterina Fake to keep cool and chill out: she's already made her millions from Flickr and she's got no one to impress.  Her investors (if any) and colleagues already believe in her, she believes in herself, and quite frankly she doesn't have much to lose.<p>Also, I did not find the description of Watson and Crick to be particularly surprising, nor the implicit comparison to her current founding team particularly valid.  Anyone who's done serious research (or undertaken a major creative endeavor) knows that you need to give yourself time to breathe, be creative, and think about the big picture.  Ironically, as I write this, I'm beginning to think the comparison may be more valid than I first gave it credit for ...<p>Finally, I was reminded of a Steve Blank quote something along the lines of ""In uncertain times, people tend to look down at their business cards and do whatever it says on the title line.""  I think as founders, when all else fails we fall back on doing <i>that</i> thing.  Those of us who are technical founders will write code and create features; those of us who are more business-oriented will build new strategies and obsess over details of the business; those of us who have to do both will, well, do both — and not particularly well.",1254053714

We've had a lot of advocacy for Haskell, Scala and F#, but no big switch. It's fairly obviously never going to happen at this point, but they still say it.<p>In the same time frame MVC has transformed web programming, with Django, Rails, Symfony & ASP.Net MVC all becoming a norm in web programming.<p>If functional programming really were that compelling, we'd have seen a similar switch by now. Instead what's happened is that all the main languages have adopted the best bits of functional programming and left the bits which make it hard to write large programs.",1362250789

5310564,comment,5301133,5301498,1,0,networked,,,">Business is business. Being a nice guy doesn't equate to winning in many cases.<p>Regardless of how relevant it is to Andrew Mason's case this is a very important point to realize. It certainly was one for me and many others I know of. Mind you, ""winning"" in this case doesn't only pertain to selfish, zero-sum victories; it's relevant in the boarder sense of ""winning"": ""the art of choosing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in your preferences"" [1]. Recently I was linked to a Cracked.com article [2] that I think summarizes the difference between ""being a nice person"" and ""winning"" in the boarder sense with great, harsh lucidity. Please don't let the tone dissuade you from read the following quote in full.<p><i>>Let's say that the person you love the most has just been shot. He or she is lying in the street, bleeding and screaming. A guy rushes up and says, ""Step aside."" He looks over your loved one's bullet wound and pulls out a pocket knife -- he's going to operate right there in the street.<p>>You ask, ""Are you a doctor?""<p>>The guy says, ""No.""<p>>You say, ""But you know what you're doing, right? You're an old Army medic, or ...""<p>>At this point the guy becomes annoyed. He tells you that he is a nice guy, he is honest, he is always on time. He tells you that he is a great son to his mother and has a rich life full of fulfilling hobbies, and he boasts that he never uses foul language.<p>>Confused, you say, ""How does any of that fucking matter when my (wife/husband/best friend/parent) is lying here bleeding! I need somebody who knows how to operate on bullet wounds! Can you do that or not?!?""<p>>Now the man becomes agitated -- why are you being shallow and selfish? Do you not care about any of his other good qualities? Didn't you just hear him say that he always remembers his girlfriend's birthday? In light of all of the good things he does, does it really matter if he knows how to perform surgery?<p>>In that panicked moment, you will take your bloody hands and shake him by the shoulders, screaming, ""Yes, I'm saying that none of that other shit matters, because in this specific situation, I just need somebody who can stop the bleeding, you crazy fucking asshole.""<p>>So here is my terrible truth about the adult world: You are in that very situation every single day. Only you are the confused guy with the pocket knife. All of society is the bleeding gunshot victim.</i><p>[1] As defined by Eliezer Yudkowsky in <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/</a>.<p>[2] See <a href=""http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-yo...</a>.

The most natural way for someone to walk, run, aim, and jump, is to actually do so. Angling control sticks, pressing buttons, and waving gestures in-air does not map one-to-one in the same way your brain maps to your muscles and limbs. Flow with the wiring of your brain rather than against it.<p>This system would require direct connection to signals from your brain, intercepting and consuming them, never reaching your muscles.

5310550,comment,5310244,5310458,14,0,dangrossman,,,"The problem is that you haven't identified PayPal's concern. It's not sussing out whether a conference is real or fake. All of the money is at risk even in a real conference, run by a trustworthy person. You want their evangelists to reach out to conference organizers. If they were intimately involved in every single developer conference worldwide, it still would not eliminate PayPal's risk. It wouldn't solve the problem.<p>The risk is that one single person holds a huge pile of funds for services that are supposed to be rendered in the future. That single person can skip out of town at any time. They could get hit by a bus. Their venue could burn down in a fire. Whatever the cause, there is a non-zero risk that the funds aren't used as intended or the event doesn't happen, and PayPal will be on the hook for hundreds or thousands of disputes and chargebacks from the purchasers.<p>This is why payment services for events like EventBrite don't work like PayPal. EB gets paid the money, and the event organizer has no access to it until after the event, when there's no chance of EB being on the hook for disputes for an event that didn't happen.<p>PayPal isn't in the insurance business. When it does allow a pre-sale, per the terms already linked in this discussion, they typically require a reserve. That means money can come into your account but you can't withdraw it. That's not malicious, that's the same thing EventBrite does. You only get the money after you've rendered the service it was paid for; it's protection for the attendees and PayPal. To expect anything different is to expect PayPal to act as a <i>free</i> insurer of events.",1362250447

5310487,comment,5308611,5310273,1,0,qzxt,,,"I'm not sure how one could possibly interpret any of my statements as being condescending towards art, so perhaps the problem is your inability to understand the topic at hand rather than my ""condescending attitude"". Like I've pointed out numerous times, I like things beyond the sciences, like every other human being on this planet. Lawyers don't just do law, they listen to music, they play sports. People don't do just one thing.<p>You mentioned that I didn't read poetry in college. You're right. As a matter of fact, I didn't complete college. I got out after a year. So if you wouldn't mind keeping your presumptions to yourself, that would be great.<p>Like I have said before, economics is king. You have acknowledged that your narrow idea of ""art"" is not economically viable. In the normal definition of art, which encompasses music, dance, film, orchestral performance, design, etc, I'm sorry but you have to be living under a rock to imply that people don't pursue these fields. So after reading your post I'm convinced your gripe is not math, it's not science, it's not history, and it's not literature. It's that people aren't paying tens of thousands of dollars to go to college to study what is really just an interest. Where the author's post reflected some one-dimensional, condescending view of people who don't just draw all day - essentially the artsy equivalent of ""you haven't read Ulysses? well poo-poo you my illiterate friend"" - your posts reflect a condescending view towards people who don't share your singular world view of ""art"". The fundamental argument, to put it as simply as I can, has been that the cornerstone of our education system has rested in the classics, literature, and art. That is what you need to be considered cultured and creative and educated. Knowledge of the liberal arts (which by the definition of the word should include the maths and sciences) has been restricted to those fields. One doesn't tell people one can't read and feel proud of oneself. When one finds out you haven't read the Iliad, or you even deign to ask what ""post-structuralism"" is to our ""intelligentsia"" you are looked down on like an uneducated bonehead who has been living under a rock. To proclaim a lack of understanding of basic algebra, OTOH is almost a badge of honor. So again, you seem to be conflating economic viability with societal cachet. So really, the only thing I've gotten out of your posts is ""my singular vision of art is not necessarily economically sustainable, and I'm angry that people don't pursue it as a career"".<p>Furthermore, I did not ""stigmat[ize] the creation of art as ""doodling"", I was calling into question your premise that because math is made compulsory for basic education in schools and art isn't, it reflects some general societal respect for sciences. Before the 1930's and 40's if an American wanted to do real research, they usually had to go to Europe. Even our highest of institutions looked down on research as being inappropriate for universities. Today, this disdain for the theoretical still lies in our culture. So why the giant about face vis-a-vis research? It became economically viable after the war, but especially during the space race. I became a programmer because that was a skill I had that I could make money with. I provided value because someone wanted to buy what I made. People become lawyers, doctors, engineers, historians, designers, etc because those are skills they have that they can assuredly provide value to other people with. Now if someone thought my piano playing was so beautiful that she would pay my rent just for me to play all day long, I'd become a pianist. It doesn't mean I love programming less, neither does me being a programmer mean I love piano and poetry less. So I feel you have to come to terms with the fact that what one does as a career is not an all-encompassing definition of who one is. In any case, the argument is not about careers, it's about a backwards, self-serving definition of creativity being purported by people who are upset that their privileged cachet to the use of that word, without question is being threatened by the ""analytical baby killers"".",1362249738

As I understand it, Google DNS is (positioned as) a secure, ad-free resolver, and tries to be as fast as possible. In practice if there is a better resolver - say, run by your ISP - for you to use, you should use that. But often ISP resolvers fail in one dimension or another, in which case Google DNS is available as a viable alternative.<p>Incidentally, to your question of what data is being collected: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy</a><p>> Similarly, sticking a proxy between a user and their destination may add more latency than it could ever save, leading me to somewhat doubt the public reason these services exist.<p>Again, in the general case that might be true.

Stylus on tablet is only barely less abstract and generally more inconvenient and expensive than mouse so mouse never really got supplanted by stylus on tablet. Stylus on display has disadvantages as well as advantages over mouse, and it's even more expensive, so again it didn't reach a tipping point.<p>Most of these ""post touch"" options are even more inconvenient, more abstract, and have greater shortcomings than touch or mouse, so I don't see them replacing touch.

This is the longest symmetric key length permitted by US Export restrictions without going through a complex process to gain export approval.<p>We do not receive any copy of the key or your passphrase, or any escrow mechanism to recover your encrypted data. I.e., if you forget your passphrase, we can't recover your data.<p>User authentication (i.e. username + password) is always performed over SSL when you communicate with Evernote. This uses 1024-2048 bit RSA keys and a symmetric session key that's negotiated between your client/browser and our server.<p>The data in user notes is also transferred via SSL.<p>Several of the company's founders come from a strong encryption background (founders of CoreStreet, recently acquired by ActiveIdentity). For Evernote's consumer product, the current encryption algorithms are chosen more for exportability under the Commerce Department rather than strength, since our software permits the encryption of arbitrary user data with no escrow.<p>We'd be interested in offering something stronger in the future when we have the staffing to fight the lengthy export battle, but Premium users can currently use an external encryption solution to encrypt important files and then add these encrypted into Evernote.",1362247750

The force here is that two fold, one the amount of keyboard interaction you need to consume content is much less than the amount you need to create it, and two, keyboards take up space that could be filled with other features. Touch became credible when you could use it exclusively to operate the device in an acceptable way. Its why it failed to displace keyboards on the original Tablet PCs (you needed the keyboard too often) and its why the iPad without a keyboard is a lot less productive to process email on [1].<p>So 'post touch' needs, by my reasoning, some force behind it if it is going to displace touch. And we can look at those forces and see where they are coming from.<p>Clearly people talking to their devices is cool, but annoying to others on the train and potentially embarrassing. That being an example of a force which doesn't allow voice to display touch. But the Myo device seems to be operable reasonably privately if it is sensitive enough. The Leap lets you do gestures locally for action at a distance, I could see that as having some pull if people continue with large displays at a distance, but being less effective if the trend becomes many touchable displays close to you. I would say Kinect is a sort of mixed bag here, great for games, a huge win for Robotic vision, but less durable as new general purpose interaction method.<p>It will be fun to watch. Just hope my toy budget can keep up!<p>[1] This are clearly pretty arguable statements, but they are hear to serve as illustration of the force pushing change on people rather than a quantitative measure of that force.",1362247554

5310326,comment,5306155,5310263,1,0,westoncb,,,"Hey Orva. Sorry to hear about the CTS :(<p>Something I've seen from speaking with a lot of people with overuse injuries is that what activates a person's injury tends to vary a lot. I'd heard elsewhere that touchscreens were terrible and didn't try them for quite a while as a result. But for me they ended up being better for a lot of things. Additionally, game controllers are a large improvement in my case simply because I can hold it in my lap instead of extending my arms, and in my case there is only limited finger pain (more arms, elbows, wrists).<p>The ideal here, however: are motion sensors--like the Kinect, but better. In fact I started out working with the Kinect, but it's not precise enough imo to create a nicely ergonomic coding system. However, things like The Leap (<a href=""https://www.leapmotion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.leapmotion.com/</a>) may be: it could take very subtle cues as inputs and track light hand motion.",1362247458

What interests me is that why would tech group that most likely knew PayPal shameful history still trust them with payment solution? Why is it that every one and each enterprenour or new startup has to go with paypal?? Do you really want to learn on your own skin?? This is not 2006 anymore! There is so many other alternatives, some less expensive, that you just need to let PayPal go. Also most of them are very trustworthy so that customers don't really care whether you use PayPal, Dwolla, Stripe or Authorize.net.",1362247457

Glamorizing programming, along with the app-stores, is pushing the independent programming business into a ""blockbuster"" mentality, a winner-take-all situation where a small number of practitioners do very well and most don't ever make their development money back.

Please read below for details and instructions.<p>In our security investigation, we have found no evidence that any of the content you store in Evernote was accessed, changed or lost. We also have no evidence that any payment information for Evernote Premium or Evernote Business customers was accessed.<p>The investigation has shown, however, that the individual(s) responsible were able to gain access to Evernote user information, which includes usernames, email addresses associated with Evernote accounts and encrypted passwords. Even though this information was accessed, the passwords stored by Evernote are protected by one-way encryption. (In technical terms, they are hashed and salted.)<p>While our password encryption measures are robust, we are taking additional steps to ensure that your personal data remains secure. This means that, in an abundance of caution, we are requiring all users to reset their Evernote account passwords. Please create a new password by signing into your account on evernote.com.<p>After signing in, you will be prompted to enter your new password. Once you have reset your password on evernote.com, you will need to enter this new password in other Evernote apps that you use. We are also releasing updates to several of our apps to make the password change process easier, so please check for updates over the next several hours.<p>As recent events with other large services have demonstrated, this type of activity is becoming more common. We take our responsibility to keep your data safe very seriously, and we're constantly enhancing the security of our service infrastructure to protect Evernote and your content.<p>There are also several important steps that you can take to ensure that your data on any site, including Evernote, is secure:<p>Avoid using simple passwords based on dictionary words
Never use the same password on multiple sites or services
Never click on 'reset password' requests in emails  instead go directly to the service
Thank you for taking the time to read this. We apologize for the annoyance of having to change your password, but, ultimately, we believe this simple step will result in a more secure Evernote experience. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Evernote Support.<p>The Evernote team",1362247417

Gays go through their youths being forced to be something they are not. For some, even when they become comfortable in their own identities in private, it's still impossible for them to confess to them socially.<p>All the more reasons to encourage gay-friendly communities in town and cities, somewhere they can be themselves.",1257123489

Three years after that it was at 6% (depending on where you look). In another year, Chrome will probably have a significant lead on Safari, which will be 7 years old. Never mind Opera.",1257123449

You're free to blog about it or whatever in either scenario, so your rant really makes no sense to me. You're not standing up for anyone else, and in fact, a bunch of chargebacks is more likely to force the company to change over just refunds that are handled internally and don't reflect badly on them.",1257123264

915839,comment,915425,915425,0,0,jsz0,,,"This is obviously more of a legal statement than a technical statement. If you go into it with the assumption that Apple's license agreement is valid then each time they touch Apple's bits without legal right they would be committing violations. If your legal goal is to prove damages you would obviously want to document each infraction. Not being a scummy lawyer myself it seems sort of similar to the damages awarded for piracy. I may only break the DMCA once by distributing one copy of a CD online however the damages reflect the number of subsequent infractions that occurred due to my failure to adhere to the license terms.",1257123005

It's not like a VC can say ""Oops"" and demand the money back <i>after</i> a company turns unethical.<p>That said, writing to the VCs might indeed be an interesting strategy for handling ethically iffy startups.  In fact, probably the most effective I can think of offhand.  I'd just strongly recommend a polite ""Please look at what this company in your portfolio is doing...

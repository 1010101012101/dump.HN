If you clearly would have a personality clash with someone, why would it be worth hiring them?<p>Easy, because they have the knowledge and experience you need for the job.  If you&#x27;re a professional you&#x27;ll find a way to work with anyone.

I believe you can be tied to your successes and dedicate yourself to something without it consuming your identity.<p>I am not saying that what you do is not a part of who you are, of course it is. But I believe there is a greater whole being ignored when your identity is limited to what you do at any given time.<p>Said differently: I simply don&#x27;t believe you can be something external to yourself. Certainly you can trick yourself into thinking that it is who you are (in whatever &quot;phase&quot; of life you are in), but again, IMO, that is a reductive line of thinking.<p>As for the Elon Musk example, you are flipping the conversation.

The police may suspect that that&#x27;s the case, but they need some kind of information that provides probable cause in order to obtain a warrant to search your house.<p>There are two general categories of ways they could then obtain a warrant: either 1.) they happen to see you carrying drugs or someone else does and reports it or 2.) they break into your house, find drugs, and then request a warrant after the fact to do so.<p>Now typically option 2 isn&#x27;t so blatant. More likely is that they break in, find drugs, and then make up some other way that they determined you had drugs. This made up story is called &quot;parallel construction&quot;, and it&#x27;s generally a way to lie and cover up the act of illegally obtained evidence.<p>If the FBI found the Silk Road IP through an example of scenario 1, then everything&#x27;s legal. But the FBI&#x27;s story provides fairly strong indication that scenario 2 is far more likely. If that is the case, then the contents of the server are not admissible in court, nor is anything obtained further down the line from that information.<p>The result: if scenario 2 is indeed what happened, it doesn&#x27;t really matter the legality of the actions committed by the defendant were under US law as the authorities have no legal knowledge of said activities.

Although I can&#x27;t remember all the details because D2 was back in 1995(!), D2 had a significantly overhauled network layer from D1.  Some examples: Short packets, where position and orientation data was quantized down into single bytes instead of floats, lower packets per second (you could go down to 5 PPS if I recall correctly).  We were also the first game where if the &#x27;master&#x27; dropped out the game another player would become the master in a hand-off scheme that was a bit complex.  The master controlled things like notifying other players of new players, end of level stuff, etc.  We had to sweat every byte because we were trying to have 8 players with low lag over a typical  28.8 baud modem.<p>D3 changed the overall feel of the Descent series, mostly because we introduced a terrain engine and that had a cascading effect on the rest of the game.

Disable any unnecessary services, expose only Tor&#x27;s proxy to the second NIC.<p>Create the other VM with 1 NIC in the virtual network with the Second NIC on the other VM.<p>This enforces Tor-only access for the second VM. Any activity must go over Tor or it may not access the internet.<p>Snapshot the VMs. Always restore the snapshots when beginning a new session.<p>Setting this up takes some time, but nearly guarantees an exploit cannot escape.<p>I also recommend disabling unnecessary services which may expose the host to attack (ie: file sharing and video and mouse acceleration) through the second VM. It may be more secure to use a low-level emulation (QEmu, VirtualBox or VMWare with hardware acceleration disabled) rather than a hypervisor-based VM solution for this.",1412271444

When an application is installed on an operating system, both the OS and application now have to be protected. An example would be Flash ontop of an OS. You have to defend, patch, and architect based on whether your systems have Flash or not.<p>With virtualization you have the hypervisor that has applications running along with it (ie: ssh, a cli, syslog, bash etc) and then you install a guest in a VM on top of the hypervisor. The OS on the VM is another vector which has applications on it (DB, web, ftp, etc).<p>If I have a bare metal server with just an OS installed on it and its applications on top of that, I only have to worry about that set of OS and applications and their associated risk vectors.<p>If I have a bare metal server with a hypervisor and then the above OS and set of applications, I have increased the number of risk vectors by however many applications are running along with the hypervisor.<p>“but do people actually believe that it makes it less secure?”<p>Just bringing a hypervisor into an environment does not of itself immediately make it less secure. I agree with you, I don’t think it <i>makes</i> it less secure. It does increase the risk of the environment and appropriate architecture and action must be taken to prevent your statement from being true. A large number of environments do not architect and manage properly.<p>Another very realistic, and happening today, example:\nBare metal server with Windows OS installed.\nBare metal server with a hypervisor which just happens to have bash on it (or is susceptible to this memory issue). The same Windows OS is installed as a VM. \nIn the second instance with the hypervisor I would have, indirectly and out of my immediate control, made my environment less secure.<p>An increase in complexity or increase in components will increase the risk of an environment.",1412271423

The server images (captured forensically) show that the then-in-place configuration made it impossible for the FBI agent to do what he claims, that is, connect to the back-end by using the server&#x27;s IP address (the allow/deny settings forbade this). The log files on the servers lack entries to support FBI claims.<p>Furthermore, FBI agents describe using other techniques to obtain information, e.g., fuzzing and packet sniffing. Not only do server logs NOT contain any evidence of this, but the agents did not preserve any evidence of their packet sniffing activities, despite having training in forensic investigation techniques and claiming expertise in these areas.<p>While it is possible that there were bugs in either the Ubuntu 12.04 hosts or the nginx servers themselves that would have allowed these activities to occur, unlogged, I suspect it would now be up to the prosecution to establish reasonable grounds for believing this to be the case. Likewise, while it is possible that the handful of lines of log pertaining to FBI activities might have been removed from the several million (yes, you read that correctly) lines of log later captured in forensic image, that does strain credulity; again I suspect the prosecution would have to establish that, somehow.<p>I&#x27;ve no particular interest in this case or in Silk Road, but I cannot help but conclude that the lawyer filing this brief just seriously schooled the FBI.",1412271207

As long as the &quot;solution&quot; is converting strings into strings (eg. magic quotes, escaping, etc.) they&#x27;re doomed.<p>At a previous job we modified the PHP interpreter to give user input a &#x27;dirty bit&#x27;. Dirty bits spread to anything they touched (dirty . clean -> dirty, implode(dirty, [clean]) -> dirty, etc.). Trying to output dirty strings (to stdout, DBs, files, etc.) was a fatal error.<p>Escaping functions unset the dirty bit. Escaping a non-dirty string was a fatal error. This worked quite well.<p>> > introduce a proper API that can be used to filter all incoming data.<p>> Things like magic quotes, etc. were tried. All failed because its a bad idea.<p>Not really. Making everyone access GET/POST vars in the same way is a bad idea. Better to provide getter functions like &quot;get_param_unsafe&quot; and &quot;post_param_unsafe&quot; for this, then provide a bunch of common alternatives which provide escaping like &quot;get_param_html&quot;, &quot;post_param_quoted&quot;, etc.<p>Even safety-conscious languages like Haskell know that there&#x27;s no one-size-fits-all approach; but as long as you cover the basics and give scary names to your escape-hatches (eg. &quot;unsafePerformIO&quot;, &quot;unsafeCoerce&quot;, etc.) then it limits the damage.<p>&quot;unsafe&quot; is basically a big red warning sticker, telling you to pay extra special attention to what&#x27;s going on. It only ever occur in custom validation/sanitising code, eg. in the definition of &quot;get_param_my_custom_format&quot;. If a codebase has &quot;unsafe&quot; all over the place, that&#x27;s an alarm bell which says the code is dangerous and needs to be refactored to provide and use some safe APIs.<p>> PDO isn&#x27;t the answer.<p>Meh, library problems. PDO shouldn&#x27;t be baked into the language, but neither should anything else.<p>> You can&#x27;t magically make people do things correctly.<p>Yes you can: you can make it impossible/very difficult to do it incorrectly. Again, stop allowing everything to be concatenated with everything else and this issue will be magically resolved.<p>> Without knowing the context (say, expecting a date vs. markdown), it would be an awful idea.<p>If only PHP were capable of providing some kind of &quot;interface&quot;, which other code could &quot;implement&quot;...",1412270449

There is also dead loss because of time travelling between work and the gym.<p>A company might well be able to provide on site gym services to employees at a much cheaper rate, especially if they already have space that is underutilised, they don&#x27;t need it to be profitable and the facilities are so close that employees can just work out during their lunch break.<p>So with everything factored in you might be comparing $60/month to compensate an employee for a private gym vs $15-20/month with an employer provided gym.<p>The net result is healthier employees because more of them are likely to use the gym than if it was not provided and it&#x27;s also a more efficient way to provide gym services if it is used by more than X% of employees.",1412270004

Because they are CHEAP to start and stop and feedback is immediate and focused on the team. They are also pretty fragile, hence why you need people who will persevere in the face of insane obstacles. In a startup it you will have too few people for all of the tasks that you need which requires a certain type of personality, someone super flexible, adaptable and dedicated to expanding your capabilities no matter what.<p>Thiel et al. are not describing work environments of people who want a comfortable life as a first goal.

As he puts it, &quot;Why work with a group of people who don’t even like each other?&quot;<p>Well, in the adult world, you hire mature, professional people who learn to work with each other and overcome their differences.  It&#x27;s fine if they aren&#x27;t all buddies outside of work.

I won&#x27;t say who they are, but will only say that you&#x27;ve probably heard of them.  Things went great, as far as I could see.

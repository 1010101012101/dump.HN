Especially regions where superstition or ignorance lead the people there to avoid treatment?

But to claim that this passage <i>in itself</i> establishes that the source is &quot;pseudoscience&quot; or &quot;bad science&quot; is, frankly, ridiculous.<p>You know, the scientific method has no special dispensations for orthodoxies -- if anything, the very notion of an orthodoxy should be repellent to a scientist.

The stationery-goods industry isn’t exactly fast-growing in this age of Facebook, Twitter, and texting.</i><p>Why does every company need to be fast-growing?<p>What&#x27;s wrong with a company that supplies a small number of consistently high-quality products to a more or less stable subset of the population, year after year, decade after decade? Why is &quot;enormous margins&quot; not enough?<p>There are inns in Japan and breweries in Germany that have been around for centuries with relatively little change. They don&#x27;t give a damn about the fad of the decade, because they know it will pass and be forgotten, just like all the fads of countless past decades. Until recently, Moleskine has been trying pretty hard to make itself look like one of them, the heir to a long line of tradition, loved by Van Gogh and whatnot. (Poor Vincent probably couldn&#x27;t even afford a Moleskine if he&#x27;d lived today, but I digress.)<p>And then Moleskine started diluting its own brand with cheap, short-lived, bastardized versions of its own flagship product. Yes, they sell a story, and their story used to be okay. Now their story is boring and confusing. It&#x27;s as if a Hollywood executive has gone through the script and tried to add every cliche that he thinks will help him sell another ticket.<p>Oh, who am I kidding. We should have seen this from a mile away when a private equity firm bought out the company. No longer owned by its founder and manufacturer, Moleskine has become little but a page in a some anonymous investors&#x27; portfolio. After all, the modern Moleskine has only been around for 17 years. Who know whether they&#x27;ll last another 17 years or not? Better bleed it dry while you still can.",1410746008

It&#x27;s original and most common purpose is emissions control, but it has been extended. An overheating engine will cause the check engine light to come on (happened to me last week in an 88 4Runner) and this has nothing directly to do with emissions. Blow a head gasket, and there could be a long list of repairs besides a new gasket. And even if it is a problem that primarily affects emissions, it might still have a bigger problem. A bad O2 sensor can cause your engine to enter open loop and run rich, meaning that you&#x27;re blowing gasoline out your tail pipe, costing you money. A misfire can cause the light to come on (bad spark plugs, compression leak, bad fuel injector, bad timing, bad lots of things) and can cause reduced power (which might not be noticeable in city driving), burnt valves, and again blowing gasoline out your tail pipe. Blowing gasoline out your tailpipe will ruin your catalytic converter, which you might not care about right now, but will matter if you try to smog your vehicle to sell it. I&#x27;ve had the check engine come on in a number of vehicles I&#x27;ve worked on, and it has always been a more serious problem than a loose gas cap.<p>The previous owner of the above mentioned 4Runner ignored her check engine light. By the time I got to it, the engine, 02 sensor, and catalytic converter were destroyed. If your check engine light is on, scan the codes and make sure that it isn&#x27;t anything serious.",1410744352

1902602,comment,1882326,1882326,0,0,JayGodse21,,,"I don't think that server side frameworks will become irrelevant. There is still a lot of value they add between the database and the HTTP interface. The part that will become irrelevant is the servlet/ASP/JSP/ERB and similar view-layers, where page-rendering policy is executed on the server. With more & more clients getting ever more powerful processors (including iPhone, Blackberry, Palm and Android), the client can do the job of executing the page-rendering policy.<p>This will mean that many applications will be able to stuff their JS (which will have to codify page-rendering policy), CSS, and static files on S3, and use the server just for authentication, authorization, activation, and data. My coding experience with Rails, ASP.Net, and PHP tells me that the most frustrating and error-prone part of using web frameworks is the templating language where you have client-side code and server-side code mixed in in the same source code file in three or four different languages (e.g. Ruby, JS, ERB, CSS).<p>Authentication is the big issue here, but don't all of the cool kids use OAuth, FB Connect, JanRain Engage or something like that these days? If so, then once you authenticate yourself to your applications via your identity provider, only a session token between a client and server is needed to authenticate per request. (Or you could use an additional challenge-response token to one-up the man-in-the-middle attackers).<p>The SEO side of this has some interesting possibilities. Of course, this technology will hurt the search engines, because your content will be much harder for them to index. Most folks will find it hard (at least initially) to use Google's prescribed tricks to make your AJAX page bot-friendly. On the other hand, it also means that your application gains some information asymmetry (because your content cannot be easily found and compared with similar content on the web), and you could use that to your financial advantage. The key here is to give the search engine enough static content as index-bait to get your site's name ""out there"" and on page 1 of the search engine rankings, but not so much that all of your valuable content is indexed and commoditized to the advantage of Google/Yahoo/Bing.",1289712443

One spot to audit.<p>With all that said - if you are a tiny 2-3 person shop, you can probably get by without Load Balancers, Firewalls, or heck, most infrastructure out there.  Just throw it all on AWS/slicehost/linode and harden your hosts to do the right thing.<p>But, when you get big, and have hundreds (thousands?) of hosts, and are tempted to run them yourself, you will have firewalls, and loadbalancers.  Many of them, in fact.<p>Check out Margrave (<a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/nbfdk-margrave-firewall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/nb...</a> ) for some of the interesting stuff around formalizing policy inspection.",1289711940

Google.co.nz has a helpline, but google.ca doesn't.<p>I wonder who decides which countries to roll this sort of thing out to? Is it done by someone who just looks up certain countries helpline numbers first, or do they roll it out based on which countries are searching heavily on key terms?<p>Google have a ton of hard data on how people live - and die - and they could use it to really optimise how society helps people in times of vulnerability and need.",1289711895

It was meant to do that but it hasn't, in all the years of its existence.<p>It wasn't designed to conduct surveillance, gather intelligence, produce scary propaganda, it was designed to catch the guy with the bomb red-handed, as in ""Oh look, there is a bomb in an x-ray machine!"" kind of situation. That that has never happened. So what do they do? As a proper and decent US govt. agency that they are -- they increase the number of rules and ask for more funds...<p>But no politician will ever dare dismantle it. Nobody wants to be ""soft on terrorism"". In case of an attack they need the TSA as a scapegoat so they can point to it and say ""look, we are spending all these money, we have all the people groped and x-rayed, there is nothing more we could have done, it is _not_ our fault""<p>So I'll agree that FBI, CIA, NSA, air marshals, the flight crew, and just regular citizens have stopped bad guys.

Call me cynical, but I can't help but think the Reddit community performs every kind act with an air of smug, self-centerdness you often find in creepy church youth groups or after school specials. I started visiting reddit because digg's links started sucking, and now I visit HN primarily because reddit is no longer about good links either. It's a maassive geek circle jerk where people share semi amusing images, write self-affirming posts, and run every meme known to man into the ground. Reddit's new slogan about sums it up: ""The Voice of the Internet."" That's a lofty claim. Anyways, the same thing is bound to happen to HN at some point. The problem with social news sites is that they all get worse as the user base grows.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping people.

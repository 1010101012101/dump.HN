You make it hard for them to leave your service by excelling over the alternatives.  That's the sane default anyway; I understand there may be cases where it makes business sense to sell your soul.  <p>But note that barriers to exit are barriers to entry too. Data lock-in is the main reason why I don't consider desktop or web apps for things such as calendar and to-do lists.  I use plain text (or YAML) files, which I maintain with a combination of hand editing and Python scripts.  This also makes it easy to keep this data under version control, and back it up.<p>Since Facebook et al are not targeted for a technical audience, maybe they don't get enough requests for data export tools.",1184754390

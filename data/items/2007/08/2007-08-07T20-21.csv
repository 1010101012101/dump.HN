(The deal is that if you get into the final 20, they give you your money back).  It seems like a bad value for precious dollars to be in the pit.  Back to coding (demo for tc20 is this Friday at 1PM - wish us luck :)",1186520144
40232,comment,40178,40178,0,0,sabat,,,"I walked by the Chron building the other day and was kind of sad. I used to be a paperboy for the Chronicle. I've read it since I was a kid.<p>The sad part isn't that old media is being replaced by new. It's that the Chronicle is dying when other papers are finding ways to fit into modern media.<p>It's seriously a shame. Kind of like when Tower Records went out of business instead of trying to reinvent itself. OK, no more 'records'. But why not just ""Tower"" and sell DVDs? Or get even crazier and sell books (they always did) and open in-store cafes? Steal some of Hot Topic's business and sell more hipster crap?<p>Obviously I'm missing something, but you just don't need to let a good brand die without a fight. The Chronicle is doing exactly that, IMHO.",1186520123

As long as no one resorts to name-calling or breaks Godwin's Law (comparing something to Hitler or the Nazis) then you can assume we're all just stating our opinions. No hard feelings.",1186519687

40221,comment,40107,40107,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"This is important research for robotics generally. <p>You'll note something in common with most deployed robots:
- Aibo is a toy that plays around. There is no function so there is no way it can fail. All robot toys are in this category.
- For vacuuming robots the biggest interaction with the environment is bumping into things. But they are autonomous.
- UAVs use GPS waypoint navigation and have nothing to interact with. There is usually no obstacle avoidance.
- Bomb disposal robots are fully teleoperated. The hands are usually pincers.<p>None of these robots have rich interaction with their environments. This is because the perception, planning, and mechanics of manipulation are much harder than locomotion tasks.<p>Bionic hands will need tiny sensors that allow for input of texture, pressure, temperature, etc.
They will probably have series elastic actuators that allow for compliance in grasping and higher reliability.<p>This is important work.",1186518191

True, not everybody does it in your case, but it wasn't YOU the initiator of those links. Its pretty much the same thing concentrated in hands of few individuals. ",1186518169

40213,comment,40097,40097,0,0,jmzachary,,,"This ""analysis"" is nothing but opinion. There is nothing data- or fact-driven about the graph (labeled ""hypothetical valuation during a general market correction"") or assertions (e.g., ""Even the most optimistic however, don't suggest that we are heading into anything but a bear market."").<p>If you are going to form opinions and hypotheses, please back them up with fact-based analytical rigor before writing an article and posting it in public. The world doesn't need more opinion masquerading as analysis.

40211,comment,40194,40194,0,0,cperciva,,,"I think there's some confusion about the definition of ""work"" here.  Most programmers are rather like powerful sports cars stuck in six inches of snow -- the wheels are spinning very fast, but no useful progress is being made.<p>Does a great programmer write ten times as many lines of code as an average programmer?  Probably not.<p>Does a great programmer solve ten times as many problems / create ten times as much functionality as an average programmer?  Absolutely.

Wouldn&#x27;t it be easier to cobble together a system that checks for healthy companies that are low in their PEG ratio historical range, and then buy-and-hold?  There are super-boring companies with reliable earnings history out there, with stock prices that go up and down throughout the year.  So you&#x27;d be trading a few times a month, not many times a day (or minute).<p>Then there are the simple algorithms like &#x27;Just buy index funds&#x27;, although I haven&#x27;t found a good resource on how to sector-balance various index funds.  Simplest I guess would be &#x27;Just buy VFINX&#x27; but that can be volatile and scary sometimes.",1439251162

Fact remains that things like, I dunno, torturing children and slaughtering villages are things that we&#x27;d be perfectly fine eliminating. We&#x27;d be A-OK without having people that have, as the near entirety of their existence, hunger and pain.<p>Even in nature, there isn&#x27;t a real balance. Any perceived balance is simply the result of ongoing fighting and current stalemates. When things go &quot;out of balance&quot;, groups or species go extinct and things move on. Absolutely nothing in nature is stopping a species from taking over the entire planet, consuming all resources, then going extinct.<p>And personally, I don&#x27;t define good in terms of evil. Like a silly saying of defining light in terms of darkness (uh, no, I&#x27;ll define it as certain energy bands or something, thanks).<p>Unless you meant this on a conceptual level, like, if we had never heard of the concept of insanity, it might be hard to say we value sanity since it&#x27;d just be an unquestioned state of affairs.

Yours and the other comments are right though - I just need to pick something and stick with it.  Maybe I&#x27;m just putting too much emphasis on trying to have a crystal-clear vision before I start; maybe I should trust the creative process more.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a fine game programmer, but just not a game designer.  Which saddens me in a little way - I want to be independent.  If I can&#x27;t come up with a game on my own, like the Notches of the world, does that mean I&#x27;ll always be stuck working for someone else?

Everything from theft of the south-west from Mexico (a war the US instigated and started) because &quot;God has given us a &#x27;manifest destiny&#x27;&quot; to the barbaric atrocities we unleashed during the Spanish-American and later Philippine-American wars (the US has tried very hard to whitewash the concentration camps, rape, and wholesale butchering of men, women, and children).<p>America forced Japan to open it&#x27;s borders (because the US wanted to use their lower islands to establish a more efficient trans-Pacific trade route). At that point, Japan realized that the game in Asia and the South Pacific was colonize or be colonized. Had we not invaded Japan for US trade route profits, had we not been demonstrating that colonial imperialism was the way forward, then Japan would have been far less likely to be pressured to behave similarly (the actions of all sides leading to an inevitable war no matter who fired the first shot).<p>I have no rose-colored view of Japan&#x27;s actions (my adoptive grandmother and her parents spent most of the war being terribly mistreated and starved in a Japanese concentration camp). At the end of the war, most of these men were executed for their crimes, but despite all the well-known American war crimes, not even <i>one</i> American soldier was charged for crimes committed and everything was hidden behind the American flag.<p>In &#x27;Grave of the Fireflies&#x27; a war is occurring, but is not the focus. It didn&#x27;t matter to those children who the &#x27;enemy&#x27; was and it didn&#x27;t matter who the &#x27;friendlies&#x27; were (neither side was willing to help them when they were incapable of helping themselves). It didn&#x27;t even matter that the war ended exactly one week before Setsuko died.<p>I agree with the author that it was premeditated murder, but the murderer was not the US or even Japan.

It&#x27;s a modern cultural movement. Similarly, simple good vs evil plot settings are not western. They exist everywhere. They&#x27;re often from propaganda, naturally occurring hero worship, morality tales and depictions of a culture&#x27;s own history. GRRM (mentioned here) is as western as Tolkien and is definitely a modern example western literature.<p>The complicated moral depictions in Game of Thrones are not new, but they are definitely strong in the current zetgeist. It comes and goes and has often reached the point of cliche. Hercules (and his analogues like Samson and Cuchulainn) are often depicted with character flaws, often involving women and madness in some way. We&#x27;ve been through a period when it was out of fashion. I think hollywood film tradition is very largely to blame, their perfect hero classics. The awesome comedic writer like Adams, Pratchet, Joseph Heller or even Franz Kafka earlier on mock this constantly. Humour is great for this kind of thing, satirising the current literary cliches.<p>That brings me to my second point. Today&#x27;s storytelling is taking this stuff to a whole new level. The complex morality tales and decompacting of group decision making dynamics that we see in everything today is really awesome, in my opinion. I think it&#x27;s great art, or at least to my taste. Playing with moral perspective and depicting the complexity of people acting in groups is an awesome thing to explore. There&#x27;s a ton of depth there and a ton of artistic flair required to bite into it. In my opinion, it hits the best notes when you have been wrenched so much that your sheltered sense of morality breaks down. It still exists, but its grim rather than fiery. Evil gets demystified, banal and sad. When a bad guy gets a just end you take on the role of a reluctant but dutiful executioner rather than a hot blooded cheerleader at the gallows.<p>Walter White is awesome because he&#x27;s complex like a real person. His angst isn&#x27;t just a flat &quot;he&#x27;s angsty because X.&quot; That&#x27;s very hard to do. I think the only way to get that stuff across is the moral grey areas and the &quot;shit happens&quot; unfolding of a person. Long format TV series give writers time to do it.<p>This stuff is really fantastic in modern art. TV shows, books...",1439248130

You build up momentum by driving with your legs, and then finish off the stroke with your back and then (at the very, very end) your arms. By the point that you&#x27;re using your back and arms, however, there is enough momentum in the flywheel that you don&#x27;t put much load on them. During the recovery, (when you&#x27;re bending your legs and preparing for the next stroke) the damper slows the flywheel back down. Wash, rinse, repeat. The load is repeatedly taken by the legs, with the back and arms adding a little extra at the end of each stroke.<p>Putting the damper at 10 knocks this all to hell. The damper removes enough of the momentum during the stroke that you&#x27;re putting a significant load on your back at the end of each stroke. At best, this will tire you out early. At worst, it can injure you.<p>You want the damper to be between 4 and 6. I usually row with it halfway between 4 and 5.

And the complement changing the code exposes a compiler bug. And also, new improved compiler results in code that&#x27;s broken.<p>Other issues I run into a fair amount is dealing with hardware/naked interrupts often involves a lot of subtle timing and read/write access issues. Sometimes this happens in code you don&#x27;t own.",1439247675

In bitcoin&#x27;s case, the primary cost is the consensus algorithm, ie the network has to &quot;outpay&quot; any potential attacker.<p>> I thought bitcoin was supposed to be decentralised – doesn’t a group of centralised developers have the ability to change everything about the currency?<p>This is a nuanced topic, we could go in depth about &quot;what does &#x27;decentralized really mean&quot;, or even worse, &quot;what does &#x27;bitcoin&#x27; really mean&quot; but I find this too hard to think about.",1439247601

It would never have occurred to Kant or Marx that anything like the genocides and purges of the 20th century were even possible. They were, if you like, naïve. It was better times.  It was by slow degrees that these things did become possible.  The savagery of the First World War, and the sick character of the Tsarist regime, are together quite enough to explain the blood-curdling aspects of the Bolshevik regime, and its Stalinist development. Any number of 'ideologies' could have filled the vacuum; in Russia, Marxism was the least likely given what it seems to say, but so it was.<p>The suggestion that Kant has blood on his hands in this connection is so completely outrageous and evil -- it puts one in mind of LaRouchites putting everything down to Aristotle and Bertrand Russell and the change in attunement of instruments. This is nonsense which serves to disable the listener's sense of reality. Once one is willing to blame Kant for Russian barbarism, one will stop at nothing.  But the truth is, the same holds for Marx, who held to an entirely conventional moral system, basically that of Aristotle.",1292453997

2010010,comment,2009666,2009816,0,0,spolsky,,,"There are a lot of things you have to know to make sense of a deal like this.<p>(1) You have to know what Twitter's financials look like. You can speculate, but since they're not public, you don't know. It may be the case that based on the financials, the growth, and a few simple spreadsheets, KPCB figured out a valuation that makes them comfortable buying at $3.7b.<p>(2) You have to know what the investor's goal is. Different VCs have different funds with different models. Funds that invest in late stage companies don't expect to make huge returns. They might see a path to a risk-free exit at $5 billion in two years. Investing at $3.7b for an exit in two years at $5b is a great investment for certain types of investors. Other types of investors are investing earlier stage and need 10x or 20x returns to make up for the complete failures in their portfolio.<p>(3) When talking about large companies with user bases the size of Twitter or Facebook, the very size of the user base can make the common stock much more valuable in a public offering. Think about how many dentists and lawyers are going to invest in Facebook on the day of its IPO because ""everybody they know uses Facebook."" Meanwhile, another, much more profitable B2B company that only has 1000 customers can be completely invisible to the public at large so the demand for their stock in an IPO would be weaker.<p>(4) $10b exits may be rare, but Twitter is a rare company. You don't see a lot of companies getting 8% of online Americans in a year or two.<p>(5) There is a very short list of investors with the midas touch. The very fact that they are investing in something makes it more valuable. John Doerr is certainly in this category. He can invest in Brown Paper Bags and make money simply because so many other investors trust him and will buy anything he buys.<p>(6) It might not be a sensible deal. The people investing in it might be idiots.",1292450439

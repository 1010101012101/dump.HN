Another, perhaps bigger caveat is that they Gods have to be perfect logicians.<p>There's a simple version of this puzzle:<p><pre><code>    Two doors are guarded, each by one sentry.
    One sentry always speaks the truth, the
    other always lies.  Behind one door lies

    have one ""Yes-No"" question.  What do you
    ask?

The trick is to ask a double question in one:<p><pre><code>    If I asked you if this is the door to freedom,
    would you answer ""Yes""?

My experience is that most people can't answer that question correctly, even when it's explained carefully in several different ways.  People aren't logic machines, and English (and probably <i>every</i> natural language) is a poor vehicle for such discussions.",1339574060

To that I add follow up on the citations.<p>The advocates don't go into detail about their amazing findings, they just wax poetic about the brilliance of the paper without offering details.<p>Since that's clearly the accepted standard, that's exactly where I'm standing on it as well. Does ""Critical thresholds associated with habitat loss"" refer to planetary scale changes or microenvironments? Does it support a tipping point of 50% altered planet? Read the paper to find out. That's just one reference. There's 100 to follow through on for the most fun.<p>That's also the only way this can be seriously discussed. Otherwise every single damn thing I will point out here will be nitpicked to death by the population purge advocates. If everybody loads up on the facts then that can't happen. So reading the paper and following all the citations is the only way to decide for yourself. Anything advocates or critics say could be bullshit here. People won't know unless they go see for themselves.<p>In this and the other thread discussing this paper, a number of people pointed out that they did not actually have proven models that really showed planetary doom, and it was also questioned whether 43% of the land mass on the planet is really either farm or city. To these responses, advocates attacked them, accused them of not reading the paper, and insisted the paper, and its citations, did support that. None of these advocates were willing to provide details about that.<p>So at this point the only way to know is to read the paper and all the citations and decide if the advocates are right about this or not.<p>I didn't have to read all 100 citations fortunately to find out since the claims are specifically footnoted.",1339573650

Not because it is not a real thing, but because you wanted to determine that it does not exist, and therefore artificially ruled out all the ordinary cases.<p>But this is a game of words because that's not what altruism is.

They are there that invention is worth it. Invention and innovation, in turn, bring about advances for the entire culture that has surrendered these specific rights, because it sees more value in progress than in the rights that are given up for it. I don't know whether a culture without patents would still advance and have as many inventors, but on the surface, this sounds like a reasonable trade-off.<p>I would restrict patent law to force a patent holder to license their patents to whomever for a reasonable price.

If your audience is technically inclined, sometimes it's fun to just quickly describe what went wrong. It could help you connect with your audience better.<p>4. Continue with everything else that can still work, and don't bring up what failed! Unless something critical went down, there's a good chance the rest of your system will work.

I wasn't addressing the ethical part of your claim at all, but since you insist: there can be a moral argument in favor of patents. It goes like this:<p>* Corporations are legal entities that are allowed because they were expected to, and have been shown to, advance our average wellbeing<p>* Corporations more effectively increase our average wellbeing if they are encouraged to heavily invest in innovation. They receive this encouragement by allowing them temporary monopolies on their inventions, thus enabling them to profit from their investment<p>* On average, the population profits: they have more free time, more money, a better health and can engage in 'creating and trading' all they want, except for a few specific instances that have been sacrificed in order to enable them to have these resources and this wellbeing in the first place<p>It's a trade-off our government made for us, in the belief it would be a net benefit. Things seems to have taken a wrong turn somewhere, but the original intent of the patent system was for the public good. That is a valid moral argument.

4104748,comment,4102248,4103787,2,0,btmorex,,,"The issue is that the first $1000 gained is worth more than the second $1000. Similarly, the first $1000 lost hurts more than the second $1000.<p>On the gain side, the different values should be self evident. I think we can all intuitively understand why making $100000 instead of $50000 is bigger deal than $150000 instead of $100000. So let's assign utility to the numbers:<p>first $1000 = 1
second $1000 = .8
third = .6
fourth = .4<p>Option #1 gives us 2.4 whereas option #2 gives us 2.24.<p>I'd argue that we can similarly rank the losses the same:<p>first $1000 lost = -1
second = -.8
etc.<p>which gives us -2.4 vs --2.24 meaning we should obviously take the option #2.<p>Now the interesting question is why we can assign similar yet negative values for the losses. I'll give two examples that might show why this is true.<p>First, consider living paycheck to paycheck. I only have $500 of buffer. In this case, while losing $2000 instead of $1000 is worse, it's not worse by a lot because either way I can't afford rent and I'm evicted.<p>As a second example, consider bankruptcy. If we take losses to high values, eventually each additional loss doesn't subtract anything from my ""happiness"". I've already hit the bankruptcy point and nothing worse can happen.<p>These are of course the two extremes, but I think it's easy to complete the spectrum and show that for any $x the first loss of $x hurts more than the second loss of $x.",1339572770

To take someones life work and market it as your own is simply wrong.</i><p>This appears to be the crux of it: is the technology that SfY 'copied' actually the direct results of decades of effort, or could it have been created by a few designers and developers looking at the problem of assisting disabled children over a few months?<p>If the approach that is used is trivial to think of and/or implement, then maybe it's not really ""marketing someone else's life's work"", but just re-implementing a simple-enough idea. If patents are granted for ideas as simple as that, then clearly patents are broken.<p>>>> <i>We intend to participate in this space (new consumer technology / tablet apps) but will only do so in a way that supports the best possible language outcomes for those clients with severe communications disorders.</i><p>I hope that includes pricing a product well within range of most potential customers, and not at $2,500+ prices.<p>If the entire approach of an app is easily copied, it hardly has the right to expect to not be copied (except when patent protected).

Nowadays it shifted. It seems to me, that there is (by some/a lot) developers a lot of bigotry involved. And on the user part as well.<p>Who didn't buy this or that app giving the evil lord of Apple the 30% cut?

4104688,comment,4104452,4104575,3,0,scarmig,,,"""Looking towards the year 2100, models forecast that pressures on biota will continue to increase. The co-opting of resources and energy use by humans will continue to increase as the global population reaches 9,500,000,000 people (by 2050), and effects will be greatly exacerbated if per capita resource use also increases. Projections for 2100 range from apopulation low of 6,200,000,000 (requiring a substantial decline in fertility rates) to 10,100,000,000 (requiring continued decline of fertility in countries that still have fertility above replacement level) to 27,000,000,000 (if fertility remains at 20052010 levels; this population size is not thought to be supportable; ref. 31). Rapid climate change shows no signs of slowing. Modelling suggests that for ,30% of Earth, the speed at which plant species will have to migrate to keep pace with projected climate change is greater than their dispersal rate when Earth last shifted from a glacial to an interglacial climate, and that dispersal will be thwartedby highly fragmented landscapes. Climates found at present on 1048% of the planet are projected to disappear within a century, and climates that contemporary organisms have never experienced are likely to cover 1239% of Earth. The mean global temperature by 2070 (or possibly a few decades earlier) will be higher than it has been since the human species evolved.""",1339571394

Thiel argues (elsewhere) that college is only worthwhile if you have a good idea of what you hope to get out of it. I completely disagree. For most people, college is the time that you discover your interests and figure out what you want to do with your life.<p>Even for these students, who seem to know exactly what they want to do, college is invaluable. It's not a coincidence that most of the major tech companies of the world (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.) were started while their founders were in college. In many ways, it is the perfect incubator: you have plenty of domain experts readily available to talk to, a good supply of smart tech people, and no requirement that your startup make any money yet.<p>So, IMHO, Thiel is doing a disservice to these students by paying them to drop out.",1339571376

If you want to curtail the out-of-control growth rate, and consensually so, women need to be able to choose birth control; they need to not fear rape; they need to not be viewed as an economic liability (where e.g. parents with a son might stop there but parents with a daughter say ""hey, we need another child so that someone cares for us in our old age"").<p>The places with high birth rates will be the places where birth control is either hard to find or culturally discouraged.<p>To test this, I went to the CIA World Factbook and multiplied their population growth rates (which are sadly from 2002) against populations to find that the situation looks approximately like this:<p><pre><code>     Country        Millions added/yr

The net is 76.46, summing over all countries, so India is 21% of the problem, China is 8.4% of it. One nice thing about this metric is that both Bangladesh and China are reasonably high here -- Bangladesh of course is struggling with some of the highest population density in the world, while China has a low growth rate but their population is absolutely staggering. It's very hard to get them both to appear in a top 10 list of ""where the problem is"".<p>If past history is any indication, China will self-regulate its population by descending into civil war, so the major thing to focus on is India + Pakistan. However, if you could make a dent in the United States somehow, that could also help to reduce our population-deficit.",1339571008

Are there categories of ""stuff"" that I can reject?<p>Answer: 
While 12Society doesnt allow for individual items to be returned or exchanged, we are highly focused on keeping subscribers satisfied and excited about the contents of each box. We do this in two ways:
1. Each box contains a wide variety of premium products. Our Style Board is intent on making the product selection in each box as unique and diverse as possible. While you may like a certain product more than another, every item is vetted and curated and the collection of products is carefully constructed. Each box is guaranteed to retail for $125+, as well, so even if you do prefer some products to others, the great value of the box as a whole makes it a great bargain regardless of individual preferences you have. 
2. Every month, 12Society will learn more about your specific tastes and style preferences, and will begin to customize the box you receive accordingly. Through recurring Style Profile Questionnaires (new subscribers fill one out at sign up, for example) and requested feedback on every item a member receives, the 12Society team will soon customize the product offering in each box to match the preferences of each respective member. You may enjoy technology more than fashion, or identify more closely with either Blake Griffin or Nick Cannon, and we will use this developed knowledge to personalize your 12Society box.<p>In addition, if you are ever unsatisfied with a particular box, we take pride in our hassle-free return policy. No gimmicks or fine print - simply return the box in its entirety to our team and we will provide a full refund and even cover the return shipping.<p>Question:
Will I receive gift-cards in the box?<p>Answer:
12Society is not a gift card company. The style board takes great pride in providing 12Society members with actual products that they themselves find joy in. That said, there may be an occasion where a gift card may provide for an increased level of customization or personal service, and may be worthwhile in those situations. Regardless, you can rest assured that you will never receive a product that doesnt have significant monetary or pragmatic value.<p>Question:
What am I getting by subscribing to receiving their picks?<p>Answer:
The 12Society Style Board is comprised of some of the worlds preeminent athletes, musicians, and Hollywood stars. While some may be young, they unquestionably lead very unique lifestyles, and are all tastemakers and trendsetters within their respective verticals and professions. They will give you not just an inside look into items that they use and love on a day to day basis, but they will actually share that item with you so that you can experience it for yourself.<p>It is an innovative business model, and helps eliminate some of the barriers that separate you from the athletes and artists you admire.<p>In regards to the quality of the products included in the box, as we mentioned earlier, each box is guaranteed to contain at least $125 of retail value. Our Co-Founders (Michael, Tim, Nasir, Blake, Kevin and Nick), are all extremely motivated and excited to create a platform through which they can connect and interact with their fans. They are entrepreneurs in the truest sense, and are the decision makers of the company. In terms of time spent ""evaluating"" and sourcing - these are products that the style board actually uses and enjoys, so there is not necessarily need to spend time evaluating different products as these are already items that our co-founders use.<p>Feel free to shoot any additional questions to info [at] 12society.com!",1339570811

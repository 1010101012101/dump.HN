As long as there are multiple browser vendors with significant market share interpreting/implementing specifications, web development is going to continue to be painful.  As evil as a single-vendor proprietary platform sounds (is?)...it sure would make a lot of things easier.<p>I've started looking into moving an application to flex for two main reasons: #1 to support no javascript.  As more and more ajax features creep in, it gets harder to always provide a noscript fall-back.  #2 to do away with cross browser compatibility issues.<p>Some concerns that I have with Flex so far are #1 no html rendering built in...so there is no way to leverage existing static html/css resources without converting to flex ui (I've read that AIR comes with Webkit, but flash in the browser does not.) #2 there doesn't seem to be good support for printing, especially compared to simple print stylesheets.  Oh, and the other huge concern is how prohibitively expensive flex developer is.",1205650621

138040,comment,137978,137978,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"6 and 5 are closely related. The way it worked for me was to<p><pre><code>  (a) generate and *polish* the idea; 
    (1) make sure it is technically sound
    (2) not trivial, i.e. not easy to copy
    (3) maps well on business opportunities
    (4) does not have IP (patents, licenses, etc) problems

  (b) implement it about 80-90% through, prepare solid beta
  (c) release beta and see how it's does
  (d) if all goes well, evaluate the progress and estimate how long until the first revenue comes in
</code></pre>
Steps (a.2) and (a.3) filter out A LOT of ideas. Step (b) also tends to screw things up as some ideas work out to be hard or even impossible to implement alone or on a modest budget. Steps (c) and (d) are pretty much the last mile before the full-time involvement. If the idea was thought through, the chances of failure on last two steps are not very high.<p>So I'd say 2+5+6 (+8) is the combination I had. Step (a) took about 2 years, (b) - under a year, (c) - 6 months. Your mileage may obviously vary :)",1205648505

138037,comment,137924,137924,0,0,halo,,,"I've been pondering this question for a while and I'm beginning to believe that they will not become particularly widespread, and that it is foolish to solely rely on their success for any venture.<p>What these ""RIA"" toolkits lack is two things:<p>* a common, unified, pleasant look and feel. The web already has this, largely forced by the own limitations and the fact that developers now know what's sane and sensible, whereas these ugly RIAs have neither of those things and seem to be a haven for poorly thought-out applications and ideas. I've seen Microsoft showing muddled pseudo-MDI interfaces, flashy visual effects all over the place and all sorts, but none of these things actually stood out as something I'd /like/ to use. They remind me more of artist portfolio and promotional sites in Flash that no-one actually likes in the first place.<p>* a killer app. I've thought long and hard, but I can't actually think of anything significant (and positive) that these applications allow that the current combination of technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flash) don't already. Yes, Silverlight provides for easier development, but were any revolutions single-handedly brought forward solely through having a more pleasant development environment rather than anything actually better for the end-user? Perhaps if Silverlight provided 3D acceleration for in-browser games it'd be a different story, as it is I'm struggling.<p>Adobe Flex is likely to just continue the success that Flash already has but will not make any great strides forward beyond Flash's current popularity (which I personally expect to wane as computer speeds and browsers continue to improve). Silverlight, despite all the resources that Microsoft are pushing into it, I can't see becoming widespread anytime soon, but equally it's unlikely to be abandoned by MS, so may just be left in limbo.<p>Of course, I probably regret these remarks in 12 months when Silverlight is the next big thing, but only time will tell but for now I remain unconvinced.",1205648429

138029,comment,137850,137850,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I think technical skills are highly over-rated, whether it is programming or mechanical design.  The most important ingredient for a successful startup is an insight into a set of problems experienced by a large enough population of potential customers that are currently unsolved and that they are willing to pay money to relieve the pain, even if it means that they might risk their career buying from an unproven startup.  If they have identify such an opportunity, you can find technical talents which are highly interchangeable.",1205647625

138026,comment,137840,137840,0,0,sonink,,,"I think it might be a good idea to get a  good programmer as an advisor to your startup. 
Give him a small stake like a percent or two and get him to verify your software outsourcing plans. I think the bigger problem here is the doubt that you will not make it incase you dont have programmers as founders. You might or might not , but that will only depend on you trying and figuring things out - it might be the case that for your domain you absolutely need a programmer on board (or not) - but there is no real way to know as such.<p>Getting a programmer on board will help you with figuring out things faster than you would otherwise have done - atleast on the programming part.",1205647260
138025,comment,137840,137860,0,0,staunch,,,"The biggest risk with having <i>some</i> technical knowledge is the knows-enough-to-be-dangerous syndrome. There's a common tendency to interfere and second guess. It can make for a hellish experience for the person doing the actual technical work. Nothing is more pathetic than repeatedly hearing things like ""It will take you 2 weeks?! I could do this in 2 days!"".<p>I think it's far better to have people who are deeply knowledgeable about the field being worked in. They'll be useful in figuring out what to build and less distracted by how it's built.",1205647256

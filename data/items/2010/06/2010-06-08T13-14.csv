By now, programmers kind of feel like pioneers and/or drainers.<p>Think about this for a second. Did Ruby On Rails enable you to venture into new lands, because you are able to program your web application more efficiently? I think so. Does RoR make your daily programmer life easier overall? I think so, too. Thus, <i>someone</i> ventured into a place and built roads and paths for people to come there and to live comfortably.<p>However, did anyone really remember the pioneers in germans marshes, in america? Does anyone see the drainers maintaining the life support systems in the cities? No. Does anyone remember the first person to write a web framework, to write a next generation language, or maintaining libraries which easen your daily life?

Or maybe, we could rename it ""double your design staff.""<p>Some comments here mention media queries, those are folks who are with the times, and care enough about their design to target it for a specific class of devices.<p>A few years ago, one could be either a print designer or a web designer. Web designers have worked hard for standard design systems like CSS for a couple reasons; the first is that we all lived through IE and Microsoft in the late '90s, and it sucked; embrace and extend soaked millions of man-hours out of the economy, and designers are still pissed about it. The second is that it just made sense to use conventions when really all that varied about web use for the first 20 years was bit-depth and resolution.<p>I'm a little bit of an early adopter, but I don't think my web browsing yesterday was totally unusual: I used a 1280x800 laptop, a 1920x1080 monitor, an 800x480 touchscreen  device in portrait and landscape, and a 320x480 touchscreen device.<p>Each of those requires its own design attention; a conscientious design would probably have separate design work for the laptop, the monitor, and the devices. An OCD designer could have more like five.<p>Standards can't legislate away usability, usage needs or user interest in a device's capabilities.<p>All that to say is that :hover works great for some design needs, and frankly, it would be cool to have it on a capacitive touchscreen, but we don't.

The world sucking makes people change their attitudes and err on the side of believing that people who are unfortunate are in their situation due to character flaws (rather than bad luck or bad starting conditions). A more objective evaluation of these individuals should take instead into account these additional features.<p>I've noticed a different dichotomy between people than what you describe. Some really pretend that the world is a meritocracy, and really go to extreme lengths to attempt to explain away differences from this position. They may be personally very compassionate to their close circle of friends and family, but have no ""intellectual compassion"" for third parties in bad situations. They do not contribute to charities, and feel cheated that ""their money"" is being ""stolen"" in tax dollars and redistributed to others.<p>On the other hand, others realise that the world is not a strict meritocracy, and can extend at least ""intellectual compassion"" to third parties in bad situations, recognising that bad luck and unfair starting conditions are the biggest part of how they're in these situations. They're more likely to treat these people as individuals, are more socially progressive, and favour redistributive social policy.<p>This article explains a fundamental bias that many people use in their judgements of others, especially the disadvantaged. As with other biases, if we are at least aware of it we can attempt to use this awareness to recalibrate our thinking slightly on social issues.",1276002358

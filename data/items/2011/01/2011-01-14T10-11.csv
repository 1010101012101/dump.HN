2103139,comment,2102862,2102862,0,0,ZoFreX,,,"Mirrors my worries regarding VP8. Many people don't understand the codec world, but generally there is a standard, and several implementations of that standard. An example - the standard: MPEG4 Part 2. Most people have no idea what that is, but if you tell them ""DivX"", they know. But if you encode a film with the DivX encoder, you will find that the XviD decoder can decode it, because they both implement the same standard.<p>Why is this great? Well, compare an MP3 made by the FHG encoder with one made by LAME at comparable low bitrates. Despite the fact that they both play fine on your MP3 player, phone, pc, et al, the quality per bit is so different you would expect them to be a different codec. Having separation between spec and implementation allows others to make better, faster, more effecient (not necessarily all at the same time) implementations, and if VP8 needs anything right now, it's a better implementation.<p>As it stands, this can't happen, and imo calling VP8 competitive with h.264 is charitable.",1295001776

2103126,comment,2101807,2102327,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"WPI was a major reason SQL Server Express destroyed my boot partition:  I'd never used WPI before, really didn't intend to be using anything like it, and, thus, didn't know WTF it was doing -- your documentation is about the first I've seen.  So, not knowing WTF WPI was doing, I ended up with two different versions of SQL Server installed, something I would NEVER want to have.  Such multiple installed instances are NOT independent and, thus, get terribly confused.<p>Then just to get started, I ran some really simple T-SQL scripts about logons, users, and permissions.  Soon SQL Server got sick and wouldn't query, uninstall, repair, reinstall, or install, and for SQL Server the usual Windows System Restore wouldn't.  Apparently Microsoft has something over 10,000 reports of SQL Server getting sick and then refusing to uninstall.  Then the only solution is to reinstall all the software on the boot partition.<p>Net, such nonsense cost me MONTHS last year.  Pissed?  No, I'm not pissed.  Long ago I was WAY passed just pissed, and I'm MUCH more than pissed now.<p>WebMatrix won't solve such problems but claims to solve problems I don't have:  Visual Basic .NET, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, .NET, and T-SQL have all been fast, fun, and easy to use.  There is NO reason for me struggle with at best poorly documented GUI nonsense and another layer of garbage to cause problems and keep me from knowing what is going on.  WebMatrix looks like an unanesthetized root canal procedure, and I won't submit to it.<p>For progress, Microsoft needs to take all their documentation, throw it out, all of it, and start over.  I mean this quite literally and very seriously.  Then they need to fix SQL Server, e.g., the fact that it won't uninstall, and especially fix the new security model first in the 2005 version which is badly broken and which apparently so far no one inside Microsoft or outside understands -- literally.<p>As it stands, from the information readily available, it appears that no serious computing should have anything at all to do with SQL Server.<p>Ease of use of SQL Server administration and management is less credible than virginity in a dirt cheap whore house.",1295001465

I want my video served in ≥720p with no buffering, as YouTube does currently. To this end, H.264 and WebM both work fine. In fact, so does flash. The only problem I have with flash is my laptop gets really hot and my battery drains rapidly every time I use it for extended periods.<p>Now, as the average end-user, I don't care about which browser supports which format.

I'm not likely to switch browsers because of video issues unless one just plain doesn't work.<p>So what does Google's dropping H.264 mean for the consumer and, by extension, adoption? Not much. The consumer will have to suffer through hot laptops and short battery life, and most won't know why. As Gruber points out, this will not encourage providers to support WebM, rather they'll simply keep serving up flash.<p>I don't see a winning path, here.

They haven’t created any new revenue opportunities, opened any new markets or increased the size of the pie. They’ve just made it more expensive to get your share, all in the highly ethereal pursuit of “open codec technologies.” So, if you do check your wallet, sometime soon, you’ll start to see less money in it, courtesy of Google.</i><p>How very wrong. If you make it cheaper for people to consume your video, that increases the share you can charge for yourself. Cheaper not only meaning royalty free, but also easier, more flexible, available in more places, etc., all things that are helped by an <i>open</i>, royalty free standard.<p>In theory that is. The thing is that licensing H.264 seems to be not much of a hurdle for non-open source appliances. At least I heard no one clamoring about outrageous license fees for that. If that leads to more or less universal spreading of H.264, then there is nothing to win from an open codec for producers or consumers, and only to loose for open source projects. Which in itself might be a good reason to try and hurdle H.264 adaptation.",1294999970

This is is to prevent ""rivers"" and make it clearer where one sentence ends and another begins.<p>I type using two spaces, because a lot of what I type ends up rendered monospace (emails, comments in code, etc.).  The nice thing about HTML, though, is that when I view the source, it's usually monospace, but the document will be rendered with a single space, and usually in a proportional font.  (I know GMail and Google Groups hate monospace, so a lot of source code and diagrams look unbearable.  There were ways to fix this, but I abandoned GMail last year; the Buzz debackle was the last straw in a long line of straws like its lack of threads.  That's a different story, though.)",1294999577

Yes, if you include Smalltalk, LISP, I'm sure there are better alternatives to learn specific concepts. But Java is used a lot in practice, and looks a lot like other languages used in practice (C++, ObjC, C#, and friends), which in my experience makes students more enthusiastic.<p>- I agree the ""generics"" are complex and overly verbose. They almost look like the C++ templated types, which I would go around with a 10 foot pole if I wanted to learn someone programming... IMO, pre-1.5 Java was  best for learning.<p>- Yes, a lot of the verbosity is pointless, I <i>think</i> it helps for learning to specifically mention everything and be a bit repetitive.

The one that looks like an f was only used at the beginning of words, also within compound nouns.
In this example, one would read as &quot;guardroom&quot;, the other as &quot;wax tube&quot;

8911686,comment,8906331,8907293,0,0,pyre,,,"> Python 3 broke backwards compatibility<p>While this is true, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to write a script that will run on both Python2 and Python3, so long as you have that goal in mind. The breaking of backwards compatibility is the breaking of several APIs and assumptions.<p>> to my knowledge everybody is still using Python 2<p>This is mostly because the release of Python 3 didn&#x27;t see everyone stop everything and immediately start coding in Python 3. Conversion has to bubble up from the major libraries (e.g. Django, Flask, SciPy, etc) first, before people are able to convert.<p>Also, switching the default Python on Linux distros takes time because you have to go through all of the packages in the package manager looking for Python scripts and make sure that anything pointed at /usr/bin/python will work with Python 3[1].<p>Another point is that a number of libraries delayed conversion, and didn&#x27;t consider Python3 to be &quot;stable&quot; until around Python 3.3. Some of other libraries (<i>cough</i> Flask <i>cough</i>) delayed support for a long time because the maintainer just didn&#x27;t like Python 3.<p>[1] I know that these aren&#x27;t always working well though. A while back I found out that Comix (installed via Ubuntu) had &quot;/usr/bin/env python&quot; in the shebang line instead. Launching it from a Virtualenv that doesn&#x27;t have PyGTK doesn&#x27;t work so well... :P",1421672351

8911634,comment,8909195,8910162,0,0,sjolsen,,,">One disagreement I have is Lisp is definitely not designed for high performance. Any competent C programmer would find the suggestion laughable.<p>A competent programmer, C programmer or not, would realize that performance is far more a matter of how you write your programs than what language you write them in; as the saying goes, &quot;You can write FORTRAN in any language.&quot;<p>Now, the original LISP was not designed for high performance, to my knowledge. Later vendor-specific Lisps, like those found on the Lisp machines, were, because they had to be. Modern Lisps like Scheme and Common Lisp capitalize on the designs and technologies of those Lisps. For example, SBCL contains a very powerful high-level optimizing compiler that is capable of folding common code patterns down to efficient, often statically-typed machine code; that compiler dates back to the &#x27;eighties when it was part of CMUCL.<p>Anecdotally, I recently ported a C implementation of introsort to Common Lisp. After adding type declarations, SBCL produced code about that took about 50% longer to run than GCC&#x27;s code. The generated machine code used scalar integers, immediate-element arrays, and no runtime generic function dispatch. The comparative slowness was a result of the fact that SBCL&#x27;s assembly-level optimization (or what little it has) is much weaker than GCC&#x27;s, not of the fact that the code was written in Lisp.<p>>less syntax just means messier code<p>Lisp doesn&#x27;t really have less syntax than other languages; it has more <i>regular</i> syntax. Forms like LET still have their own syntaxes beyond the lexical syntax of lists. Now, seventeen levels of infix operator precedence, <i>that</i> makes code messy.<p>>Parentheses everywhere doesn&#x27;t make a language good. Just harder to read<p>Parentheses don&#x27;t make Lisp hard to read. Being unfamiliar with that style of code layout makes Lisp hard to read. Once you&#x27;re accustomed to it, the parentheses become mostly background noise, much like C&#x27;s semicolons or many languages&#x27; &quot;$s.&quot; Indentation is far more important, again just like in C. Lisp has the advantage that properly laid-out code clearly visually reflects the evaluation hierarchy, which is more than can be said for a lot of infix code, especially when dealing with complex arithmetical expressions.<p>>The &quot;macro system&quot; which refers to the ability to perform arbitrary functions on arbitrary data, is not unique to lisp.<p>That is not at all what Lisp&#x27;s macro system does, and while there are other languages which have similar macro systems to Lisp&#x27;s, they&#x27;re at least as niche.<p>>And in general, usually obfuscates code and makes debugging harder.<p>Macros, when used correctly, make code more clear, not less. In fact, I&#x27;ve seen this argument made about a lot of different features in a lot of different languages, and it seems to me that what it usually means is, &quot;I don&#x27;t really understand what that feature is designed for.&quot; It&#x27;s like claiming operator overloading is bad because it lets you define &quot;+&quot; to do division, even though you can just as easily write a function named &quot;add&quot; that does division.<p>>Everything that you can do with macro&#x27;s and Lisps&#x27;s homogeneous syntax is achievable with similar constructs in other languages<p>I can write a Lisp macro named DEFINE-ENUM that essentially does the same as C&#x27;s enum, but also establishes a mapping from enumeration values to names; then, I could do<p><pre><code>    CL-USER> (define-enum color
               (red    7)
               (blue   23)
               (purple 30))
    COLOR
    CL-USER> purple
    30
    CL-USER> (enum-name &#x27;color 30)
    PURPLE
</code></pre>
How would you do that in C? It may be doable, but certainly not both general and easy. You&#x27;re wading into the Turing tar-pit here.<p>>Programming languages where data and functions are delineated by design have clearer structure and organization<p>Lisp delineates functions from other data (on that note, you described Lisp as &quot;untyped.&quot; Lisp is in fact strongly typed). It lets you treat <i>code</i> as data if you like, but again the structure and organization of a program is a matter of how you write it, not what language you use. It&#x27;s true, though, that Lisp <i>lets</i> you use (sometimes radically) different organizational structures than languages like Algol and C, but again those structures are unclear mostly because they&#x27;re unfamiliar, not because they&#x27;re inherently convoluted.<p>>Additionally they allow the compiler or interpreter to optimize by design<p>Lisp gives the compiler more room to optimize than a language like C; the tradeoff is that you don&#x27;t have a human optimizing the difference as a matter of course (e.g., choosing a concrete integer type). This can sometimes be a good thing, and sometimes it isn&#x27;t.<p>>In the rare case it&#x27;s useful to have a function become a data argument, there are usually accommodations in the language to do so<p>It&#x27;s actually very often useful <i>if</i> you have a way of writing generic algorithms; this is why &quot;functors&quot; are common in C++ (especially with the advent of lambda expressions), but not so much in C.",1421671359

Once your processing pipeline is making liberal use of the sort/grep/cut/tee/uniq/tac/awk/join/paste suite of tools, things get slow. The tangle of Unix tools effectively does repeated full-table scans without the benefit of indexes, and is especially bad if you have to re-sort the data at different stages of the pipeline, e.g. on different columns, or need to split and then re-join columns in different stages of the pipeline. In that kind of scenario a database (at least SQLite, haven&#x27;t tried a more &quot;heavyweight&quot; database) ends up being a win even for stream-processing tasks.

This is best in the long term, but obviously sucks for the short term.   The worst is the sanctimonious looks you get from everybody because you&#x27;re letting your children scream it out.<p>3 - punish them.   This is just a variation on #1.  They wanted attention, and now you&#x27;re giving it to them.   The difference is that it&#x27;s much less likely to actually stop the screaming.<p>Of course, the worst of both worlds is starting out with #2 and then giving in to the sanctimonious looks and the screaming and doing #1 or #3.<p>While applying 1, 2, or 3 you should also work to find and ameliorate the root cause.   Are they tired, hungry, bored or over-stimulated?   The last two are particularly hard to tell apart.

Spending the money is a new crime, opening a bank account is a new crime. These expenditures do not have to be in furtherance of the original crime, but my recollection is that here it alleged that they are. In short, throwing in a money laundering allegation is quite common in US federal indictments.&quot;<p>Page Pate, another Atlanta-based defense lawyer who has also worked on international extradition cases, agreed. &quot;It&#x27;s almost automatic to add money laundering charges to any offense whether it&#x27;s drug-related or not,&quot; he said. &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen it that often in criminal copyright cases.

DON&#x27;T TELL THEM HOW MUCH YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING PAID OR GIVE THEM A RANGE.<p>Recruiters always ask this up front and INSIST that they must know.  I have NEVER been denied the opportunity to interview for refusing to give a number upfront.<p>If you&#x27;re applying at a company, it means you&#x27;ve done at least a little research on what they should be expected to pay and you see somewhere around that range as acceptable.  You don&#x27;t have to tell them that you&#x27;ve researched their rates and find them acceptable, because that too would be like giving them a range, instead the research is simply to avoid wasting your time.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to interview for a job that pays the position with compensation worth at most $60k when you&#x27;re already making at least $100k.<p>This way, you have an advantage: you know roughly how much they pay but they have almost no idea how much (i.e. how little) you will accept as compensation.  Best case scenario, they offer you MORE than what your research said they would, and you negotiate a little more on top of it and accept, assuming you actually like the job. Even if they say no to your counter offer, you&#x27;re still ahead.  Worst case scenario, they offer you less, they say no to your counter offers, and you have to decline.  Either your research was wrong or they were lowballing you, either way you&#x27;ve got multiple other interviews in process (right?) so move on.  If you find your research is repeatedly off the mark, find better sources.<p>No matter what, don&#x27;t give them a number.  Make them give you a number first and negotiate from there.",1421669110

If you&#x27;re interested, I recommend you consult the available literature on Nietzsche&#x27;s views on women, like Nesbitt Oppel&#x27;s <i>Nietzsche on Gender,</i> which argues that though his writings often use misogynistic language, his views on women are deeper and don&#x27;t reveal personal misogyny, more the opposite.

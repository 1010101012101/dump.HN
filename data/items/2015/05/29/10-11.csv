The counter-intuitive results need to come from hidden cameras, point-of-sale data, functional MRI scans, etc instead of questionnaires.<p>If the survey is asking about <i>nouns</i> (what they have) instead of <i>verbs</i> (what they think they do), it&#x27;s more reliable.  For example, a survey asking <i>&quot;what&#x27;s your shoe size?&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;how many children do you have?&quot;</i> doesn&#x27;t cause people to give contradictory answers.<p>I&#x27;m also skeptical of websites using &quot;focus groups&quot; asking people &quot;<i>would you pay for X if it had Y?</i>&quot; type of questions.  You may get better answers by just trying different things and parsing server logs to measure actual user engagement.  People don&#x27;t know what they want, or they&#x27;ll tell you what you want to hear.

The team are all seniors and I applied to be a programmer. When I started, I found out that my 3 years experience in Ruby on Rails is not enough for me to match my seniors. So I started as a junior programmer. But I didn&#x27;t start work as what the job that I applied to. First I was sent to work on customer service. Answered tickets, answer calls, learn the product, etc.<p>As I continue on the job I was changed to QA (Quality Assurance) I haven&#x27;t question why I have change roles or responsibility. I remember that it was on the contract but I haven&#x27;t signed it because they forgot to give it and even remind them of it repeatedly. Anyway, after sometime I go on errands checking on the devices that run the app, do some test then report.<p>I wasn&#x27;t happy about what I was doing and the seniors are very busy programming. Although they offered to give me a mentor but it didn&#x27;t happen. It was a pressure to learn programming at the same time when you were exhausted doing work for 12 hours 6 days a week. So I wasn&#x27;t able to really focus on programming as I start to burn out due to the long work hours. Then after a while they found a person that is more suited in QA. Eventually, I was moved to data entry position. At that time I know that it&#x27;s time to quit. Then, Monday morning they asked if when am I leaving.<p>I learned a lot at the startup and also how organized the developers take bugs, feature and enhancement. And then I started to do my startup. It&#x27;s a challenge but because of my learning form the startup, I was able to get an idea to move from programmer to entrepreneur.",1432896751

9623801,comment,9620204,9621738,0,0,jsingleton,,,"Nice article. It certainly works at scale because of the economies. I think this distributed system has potential but there are some issues. There are also some things they could do to make it better if the trial is a success.<p>Using resistive heating (which is what this is) is not very efficient (even if it&#x27;s a by-product). A better way to heat your home is to not waste power and use it instead to run an electric heat pump (which are <i>over</i> 100% efficient). There is a good analysis in the &quot;Mythconceptions&quot; section at the end of chapter I.11 of the excellent &quot;Sustainable Energy — without the hot air&quot; [0] on p71 (p84 of the free PDF).<p>That&#x27;s the downside but there are some interesting applications. They could enable you to host your own personal cloud on the box in your home. So you know where it is.<p>You could vary the operating time of the servers so they only operate (or at least only run at 100%) when heating is needed. This could be based on the season, an external temperature sensor or weather data. Processing could migrate between the hemispheres of the world depending on the season.<p>The load could also be varied based on the local grid demands and power mix. Various real-time data sources are available that report on how green the current energy mix is [1] [2]. You can even just measure the frequency of the electricity to see how well generation is matching consumption. This is known as dynamic demand or demand shaping and you can even be paid by the grid operator for it so it could be a good business model. It would also be nice if they partnered with green power companies that buy their energy from renewable sources.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/download.html</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.earth.org.uk/_gridCarbonIntensityGB.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earth.org.uk/_gridCarbonIntensityGB.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/</a>",1432896714

If you have 16 cores that is 16 requests being processed in parallel. Go hasn&#x27;t even got out of bed by the time it is handling 16 connections. When Go is being used for it&#x27;s intended purpose - handling thousands of concurrent connections, you need to be a lot smarter than just running on all the cores you have.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you wouldn&#x27;t use all cores to maximize utilization - what I am saying if that if you are scaling beyond one core, then you would already be thinking about scaling across multiple servers behind a load balancer - i.e. you are doing ops work on a production scale cluster. And if you are doing production ops work, you are going to be tuning all the processes under your control in detail, not just making rash assumptions about how they may or may not utilization multiple cores.<p>The point I was arguing here is that someone who said &quot;Back when I was learning Go&quot; and who understands the &quot;nature of the claims of the language&quot; is not going to be running into these sorts of scalability issues, and would not be bitterly disappointed to learn of a default threading value of 1. Unless they had some misconstrued understanding of what Go&#x27;s concurrency support was all about, and made an incorrect assumption that it was primarily about parallel computation, rather than it&#x27;s true purpose of having many thousands of lightweight processes handling lots of network I/O.",1432896301

In this scenario, the only solution is to either queue up work and make the client come back later, or scale across many servers behind a load balancer.<p>The point I am making here is that people who are engineering scaled out systems across multiple servers to handle thousands of concurrent requests are usually high-end ops people who are not going to be naively assuming that any process will be doing threading in a particular way - they would have already tested Go in details first and would very quickly have seen you need to set the GOMAXPROCS variable to use more than one core.

In the CAD software I used I had to clone primitive objects to use them in multiple operations. If I wanted to change one dimension I had to update all the clones. Simply the acyclic graph model works better for this than the tree model. (Also some operations were irreversible, that was absolutely inexcusable.)",1432894622

I wrote a simple SCORM implementation for an eLearning software that was mainly for testing content being developed.  This became the LMS for a <i>VERY</i> large aerospace company for about 9 years, not to mention evolving and being included as a base for several products since (over the past 12-13 years).  I didn&#x27;t implement the entire spec, only what was most needed for my own use.  It went over 11 years before a missing piece of the spec was requested to be added.<p>I guess the point is, when you have something that is as relatively easy to implement as JWT, it makes sense to do it yourself, and only implement those pieces that you need.",1432894520

Every listed company is to pay an amount equal to some formula derived from its share price and market value. The money collected every year in the pool is then divided among all shareholders equally.<p>- Mandate all entities to get listed and traded. Otherwise tax at a punishable rate.\n- Simplify reporting obligations so listing is not painful.\n- Reduce corporate tax to a fixed amount under-20 percent and income-tax under-15 percent so companies and individuals have incentive to register and get listed.<p>This would ties the single most important metric of capitalism, share price, to the democracy that makes capitalism possible at first place. Also all derivatives or executive compensation, investor returns are related to share price.<p>The division is periodically reassessed as people join or leave pool.",1432894282

Looking at this jumping-over-obstacles video, it seems like the robot is lacking flexibility. The real life cheetah&#x27;s hind legs go quite a bit underneath in preparation for push off. Contrast this with how the robot&#x27;s hind legs are a little too behind and the robot stutters a bit after every jump.

8071,comment,7993,8001,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Older programmers are more productive than younger programmers.   I think the perception that goes the other way is based on teh confusion of measurements of productivity.<p>Zuckerman measurs productivity as lines of code generated, or worse, new classes generated.   Kapor (I presume) would measure productivity as number and difficulty of new features correctly implemented.<p>It seems that in the late 1990s, and since, the number of ""programmers"" who are not hackers has risen dramatically.  Hackers started programming at 12 because they were technophiles.<p>I have actually worked with a jock ""programmer"" who was proud of the facct that he didn't have a computer at home-- he left all his work at work.  He was an extreme case (And he produced lots of lines of code, but not a lot of functionality)... but the trend seems clearly there.<p>Apparently programming has become a prestigous career- and this has led to the rise of defensive tecniques like unit tests, and otherwise organizing projects around the assumption that your ""engineers"" are idiots. <p>FWIW, all the job adverts that say ""Rockstar"" or ""superstar"" or ""coder"" in them - I immediately filter out because I assume they were written by someone who had no clue what a strong engineer looks like.  No engineer worth their salt wants to be called a ""Coder""- this is a derogatory term.  Hacker is the word that they really should use, but the people who say ""rockstart"" are people who do not know that ""hacker"" means something other than one who breaks security on systems.<p>I see the word ""rockstar"" and I immediately know they are looking for someone with lower skill than I have.   This is not arrogance-- its just experience with HR types.

8068,comment,6668,6668,0,0,jayliew,,,"Not to nitpick or anything, but in the essay:<p>""If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are""<p>I understood what the last line meant, although it may seem ambiguous to some. It could easily have been interpreted to mean that if you think you are stupid, that means you are probably correct that you are stupid, and shouldn't start a startup.<p>But what do I know, I'm no linguistics expert ;P",1175467108
8067,comment,6668,6668,0,0,jayliew,,,"I love the comment about telling an adult from a kid. I'm 25 and many a times I just feel my peers are clueless, or should be more mature than they should. Maybe I'm just thinking too far ahead, but the same goes for dates that I go on. Dumb clueless girls actually turn me off (even if pretty). My friends think I am kidding when I say I am attracted to women a little older than me because they assume I am a gold-digger. But I'm not, I just like their maturity over girls my age.<p>Anyway, for the longest time, I couldn't really describe, I didn't have any solid metrics on how to explain to a friend, why I think a girl is mature/inmature. It's not about the age. <p>I think your point about pulling the ""I'm just a kid"" card totally makes sense. Kids tend to wait for something to happen (reactive) -- wait for their mom/dad/boss to tell them to do something, they need to be prodded, at which they will say ""do I really need to brush my teeth now?"" and groan. Adults are they ones who anticipate the next move, planning the strategy of where to go next, looking out for potential pitfalls and coming up with ideas of mitigating (proactive).<p>I guess I just am attracted to driven people, and dislike pessimists. I've seen plenty of people in college and in corporate who pessimists/downers like that, because they can't come up with new ideas/strategies. So by shooting at ideas of their peers, and bringing their peers down to their level -- they get to maintain the status-quo.

Without knowing too much about RightCart, I'd say go with Auth.net if you want to do it for the long haul and want more control.

8061,comment,7935,8046,0,0,nickb,,,"This past week I listened in on Werner Vogels' ETech 2007 speech and he said, explicitly, that EC2 is not suitable for high performance, large scale, databases. My database is more than 10Gb in size. You can't have that large image on EC2. I guess you could get away by hosting some tables there that:<p>a) don't take up much space,<p>b) don't change much and<p>c) don't have to have the latest data.",1175464927

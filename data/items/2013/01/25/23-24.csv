I write Android apps all day long, but I have yet to find a (legitimate) need to decompile someone else's apps. I suspect all this decompiling, repackaging, and re-signing is designed for people to strip license checks, remove ads, add some other nonsense, and repackage the whole deal for distribution on 3rd-party app stores or websites, without the consent of any of the original developers. I've seen this with my own apps, which are repackaged with different resources, while keeping the code mostly intact. The result is then re-published by someone else. Instead of spending so much energy ripping off other apps, why not create something new? We certainly haven't exhausted what's possible in terms of app breadth and quality.",1359158374

We certainly don't want to go broke!<p>However, we feel very strongly that Watsi should be run like a successful startup, and <i>not</i> like a traditional non-profit.<p>Sustainability is extremely important to us. I'm a terrible fundraiser, and I want nothing more than for us to cover our own overhead.<p>However, it just doesn't make sense to implement revenue generating features (e.g. take a cut of donations, which to be clear we will never do) until we hit scale. Right now, we're entirely focused on improving our product, speaking with donors, and maximizing our impact.<p>However, just like any successful startup, there will (hopefully) come a time when the costs associated with scale begin to outstrip the seed-support we've so generously received from people like pg and Jessica. When that happens, we will implement features that generate revenue for our organization, and we'll have a user base large enough to make those features viable.<p>Without going into too much detail, those features will include things like asking donors for an optional ""tip"" to Watsi when giving to a patient (expected to net 6-8%), cause marketing products (already a few companies interested), white label, etc.<p>We will never abandon the 100% model, and I'm completely confident that for as long as there is demand for the service we're offering, we'll find a way to cover our overhead.",1359158332

5118503,comment,5106767,5106767,1,0,akrymski,,,"Thank you Heather!  I could never be bothered to remember the commands for the swiss knife that is sed to do something as simple as this.  Why I love this:<p>- js syntax for regular expressions is what I'm most familiar with\n- defaultignore is very helpful\n- completely cross-platform\n- can be used directly from my other node projects that need to search and replace files\n- it's something i'd never be bothered to write because looking up sed syntax takes less time - so thank you for taking the time to do it and open source it!<p>Don't get me wrong - sed's great cause it's so powerful.  Bash is powerful too.  But I'm not a fan of either.  Software should make our lives easier, not force as to learn cryptic commands to get simple things done.  Compare ""sed --help"" to ""replace --help"".  What will the future generation prefer when they need to do a basic search/replace task?  The route of least resistance of course.<p>Making simple tasks simple is what real innovation is about.  I don't consider myself a poor developer, I know a handful of languages, I'm just not a linux geek because I believe that interfaces should come first.  I'm a developer / designer and I love simple and elegant solutions to every-day problems.  Your module is exactly that.  The reason some ""experts"" are up in arms is because it challenges the status quo.  You no longer need to be a linux wizard to search and replace files.  Hell - you don't even need linux.  And the simplicity and approach of Node is what makes it possible.  As Steve Klabnik said - this is actually their way of showing how much they hate node.  And hate is a powerful word for ""being afraid"".  And I'd be too if I dedicated a good chunk of my life to becoming a Ruby expert.  ""Ever wanted to make sed or grep worse?"".  Hahaha.  I guess Apple I was also worse than the all-powerful mainframes of its day.  That's probably exactly what the IBM guys said.  Buy a PC that doesn't come with a screen?  That does only a fraction of what IBM PCs do?  Ever wanted to make an IBM PC worse? :)  When the experts are afraid - that's when you know the Node movement is on to something.<p>PS Already almost 400 people have starred your project - I think that's saying something.  Would be interesting to know the number of installs :)",1359158221

I implicitly changed the subject to my own fantasy tangent.<p>My point is that <i>if</i> one is going to build a narrow vertical stack up from specialized hardware, there had better be a 10x advantage over running the application the ordinary way or the experiment becomes a why-bother. Also,  the application had better be valuable enough to justify the effort.<p>This vision of systems design has been alive in the Forth community for a long time  maybe not the ""iterating on hardware as part of application development"" part, but certainly the specialized vertical stack idea, just in a very austere form. They make the tradeoff of dramatically reducing what the software will do in order to make it feasible to develop that way. That's a tradeoff most of us aren't willing to make. But I have a feeling there are more options if one is talking strictly about servers.",1359158174

5118489,comment,5117042,5118440,1,0,youngerdryas,,,"The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to impose environmental policies, or to increase fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving).[7][8] Several points have been raised against this argument. First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant.[6][9][10] Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil.[11] Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a green tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.[3]",1359157987

There's really not much of a difference whether you use identifiers to come up with filenames, or you use filenames to come up with identifiers. If anything, I think filenames are preferable, because the user doesn't have to be aware of the scheme the tool uses to convert identifiers to filenames. The fact that identifiers are just a little bit shorter (e.g. don't have .txt extension or something) does not overweigh the inconvenience of knowing where the files are. The problem with this approach is because figuring out where the files are requires knowledge of the tool inner workings, that can only be acquired from reading the code or documentation.<p>There's another problem with these naming conventions, is that if you use the same code in multiple steps, things can become quite confusing. How will BPipe name them? Or is the only way to handle it is to copy-and-paste the code and create another rule?<p>It seems like not clear enough separation between the code and the filenames can be a source of problems... Please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>When I compare:<p><pre><code>   _ <- contracts.csv\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    evergreens.csv <- _\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>   contracts:\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT.csv\n\n   evergreens:\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT.csv > $OUTPUT.csv\n\n   contracts + evergreens\n</code></pre>\nI strongly prefer the first option, because there's less implicit things going on, and the code is separated clearer from the file naming. Besides, it's even shorter.<p>> Similarly if there are a lot of inputs and you need the one ending with "".txt"" you will write ""$input.txt"", if you want the second input ending with "".txt"" you will write ""$input2.txt"", and so on.<p>This can work for very simple workflows with maybe several cases of multiple inputs and outputs, but it's unmanageable when complexity grows.<p>Imagine a step which takes 3 inputs - one separate, one which is output #2 of a previous step, and one which is output #6 of yet another step. You can't use numbers to resolve that. You will end up coming up with some sort of semantic identifiers, which will almost completely replace BPipe's naming convention. And what's worse, they will be hard-coded in your step's commands, which means you'll have to edit the code if you want to change the filenames, or re-use this step's implementation somewhere else.<p>> When you start having hundreds or thousands of outputs naming them quickly goes from being something you want to do to a chore that drives you completely crazy and you want a tool to help you with.<p>I'm not sure I agree here. Here's how I see it:<p>Instead of naming hundreds of files, you have to name hundreds of methods (commands). Yes, you don't have to repeat the filenames to create dependencies, but you have to repeat the method names (in ""contracts + evergreens""), and in a way which quickly breaches the boundaries of readability.<p>This doesn't work for complicated workflows, and for simple ones, I would prefer positional linking rather than comping up with names, like in the example I provided above.<p>There's nothing that prevents Drake from coming up with filenames from more abstract identifiers. We could come up with some syntax where you'd just give an identifier (say, ""~contracts""), and we'll take care of the file location and name, just like BPipe does. The major difference is not this. The major difference is that we think you need to identify inputs and outputs to build the graph, and the method name is insignificant until you want code re-use, and BPipe seems to take the opposite position - that you need to give method names, and then use a separate expression to build the graph.<p>I think I provided at least a few strong arguments why BPipe is wrong on this one. I would really love to hear your further thoughts.<p>> As I touch on above, it's really not too hard. Bpipe gives you ways to query for inputs in a flexible manner to get the ones you want.<p>I'm sorry I didn't understand neither this nor the example you provided. Could you please elaborate? In the example you provided you identify different outputs by adding a number to their names. Is that how subsequent steps are supposed to refer to them as inputs - by the positional output number from the step that used to generate them?<p>> I'd argue that it's more than syntactic sugar, though - it's a different philosophy about what problems are important and what the tool should be helping you with.<p>I appreciate your opinion. But the way I see it is this:<p>1) As far as different philosophies go, I find BPipe's one to be a bit problematic for complicated cases.<p>2) And for simple cases, it all comes down to syntactic sugar.<p>I understand it's hard to argue an abstract, so I'll tell you what. Give me an example of a BPipe workflow that you particularly like, and I'll put it in Drake. I might need to invent some Drake features on the fly, but it's a good thing. This is what these discussions are for. I'll try to show you that there's no philosophical difference, and Drake has a more flexible approach overall. I am looking forward to this challenge, because your opinion is important to me.<p>Thank you!<p>Artem.",1359155968

Is crowdfunding a sustainable solution for healthcare? It's something we think about a lot as a team.<p>Right now, there are people dying for lack of available and relatively cheap medical treatments, simply because they can't afford them. We think the only moral thing to do is fund their treatments.<p>However, is this sustainable? I'd argue that it is for two reasons.<p>First, the organizations we partner with are all working towards fairly obvious sustainable solutions. Some establish public-private partnerships, others cross-subsidize, and others have a very strong focus on training local doctors (some do all three - we require at least one).<p>Second, and without getting into a really deep discussion here, only about 40 out of 200 countries in the world have a formal healthcare system. And those systems that work best are, for the most part, universal healthcare systems financed by the government (i.e. the costs are crowdfunded via taxes). However, with the world becoming smaller by the second, is it too crazy to think that Watsi might one day be the first truly universal healthcare system?<p>What if instead of a mandatory tax, of which a % is allocated to national healthcare, human compassion was enough to fuel a global healthcare system? For the first time in history, the internet is making this feasible. The only question that remains is whether human compassion is enough to solve one of the world's greatest challenges.",1359155416

Apollo only used Saturn V since there was so little time and so little experience in orbital rendezvous, which turned out to be possible quite easily. There's also a reason why the Saturn V was not flown beyond the Skylab mission or why no more were built. It was just too expensive and only few payloads would justify using it.<p>If american space policy was more rational, it could achieve much more in a shorter period of time.<p>In an industrial sense, the F-1 tests are always interesting and probably don't cost a lot of money. The engine was not that advanced, a normal, if big, gas generator kerosene engine.<p>The same ""ancient artifacts"", could be said from the NK-33 engines, that were built in the seventies in the Soviet Union but are going to fly this year in Orbital Science's brand new Antares rocket to resupply the ISS. The engines are still state of the art high pressure oxidizer rich staged combustion with thrust to weight rates of around 100.<p>In what other field can you reach such levels of technological advance that they stand unsurpassed forty years later?",1359155205

They're a lot like programmers that way; further optimization is often only a step backward.<p>The old, JSM design was an absolutely stunning example of what web design can be. It looked like a magazine. It read really well. Hell even the ads fit like an accessory.<p>It's really hard to improve something so good. And this new design pretty much proves that.<p>Unfortunately, their audience are people more concerned with trends and 'what's new' than those of us that prefer neat and predictable content delivery. I'm sure in their echo chamber, they will overwhelmingly agree that the design is ""fresh"" and ""great"".<p>Let that be a lesson to developers everywhere about spending too much time with our own kind and not enough with the general population.",1359155120

For an MVP, focus development items in terms of days and ( at most ) weeks. Go to a developer and tell them what you are looking to do. Then, ask them what part of it can they implement in one day or one week. If you like what you hear, hire them for that time frame and see how they do.

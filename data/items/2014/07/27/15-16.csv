In aggregate maybe 25-30 branded apps on the iOS store could make 10k per month.  The rest were garbage.<p>The most I ever made was 1m over a year on 7 BREW apps we made. That&#x27;s right, those old dead handsets had only 20-30 apps in their store and we owned about 20% of the market.<p>What made that possible is that the ecosystem was so bad and it was so hard and expensive to get apps reviewed and built for multiple handsets, you could make money as long as you just got on the device.<p>The relative ease of launching has made a plethora of nice but unprofitable apps on the other ecosystems... And it points to what happens in any work economy when the barrier to entry becomes hobbiest-level easy. Happened to photography, writing/publishing, and others.

8093059,comment,8092518,8092518,2,0,Ologn,,,"They analyze the data on a per app basis, which may not be the best way to do it.  Let&#x27;s take the Facebook developers on Android.  The Android Facebook app has been downloaded over 500 million times.  Facebook&#x27;s Android Slingshot app has been downloaded less than half a million times.  With the way Visionmobile/Techcrunch break down the data, on an average per app basis, the existence of the Slingshot app drags the achievements of the flagship Facebook app way down - it halves it, basically.  This doesn&#x27;t really bear any relation to how much success Facebook has had though.<p>HN often contemplates the power law, so it&#x27;s natural a developer might have one app which is very successful (Rovio released 51 apps before releasing Angry Birds), then another app which is half as successful, then a third app half as successful as the second app, and so forth.  This analysis doesn&#x27;t think in those terms though, they are more of the idea that every app released by a company will be more or less as successful as the other ones it releases.<p>Also the report sets the bar fairly high.  It calls people who make $9000 per app per month &quot;strugglers&quot;.  I&#x27;d be happy with one app making $9000 a month, and wouldn&#x27;t be struggling making the resulting six-figure salary.  Even if I had two or three apps making $9000 a month each I&#x27;d be considered a struggler.  This isn&#x27;t really struggling.  Maybe for a firm with venture capital that was expected to grow quickly it would be considered a failure, but not for a bootstrapped developer, or partnership of developers.",1406476339

8093030,comment,8090190,8091355,2,0,peatmoss,,,"The rental option is really compelling. In Seattle, the missus and I use a mix of biking, walking, public transit, Car2go, Zip car, and UberX. Not owning a car, we make a choice each and every time we go somewhere that balances convenience, travel time, and cost. We save heaps of money, and stay in shape by not having a &quot;default drive&quot; option.<p>When people have already bought a car and paid a flat insurance rate, the <i>marginal</i> cost of another car trip is very low. Thus, people who own cars don&#x27;t really make a choice very frequently. Their choice has already been pretty much made once at the outset.<p>Because carsharing services will almost undoubtedly be the first deployments, self-driving cars cannot come quickly enough for me. I think the net effect is that they will drive (har har) more people to adopt carsharing services. Self-driving cars will solve one of the inconveniences of something like Car2go, namely the need to walk some indeterminate distance to a car.<p>If they can get more people into an a la carte transportation usage model, I anticipate public transit and non-motorized transportation options will benefit greatly. Since trip costs will only be marginal, the choice to do something other than drive will come up routinely.<p>As self-driving carsharing fleets replace the >90% idle private vehicles of today, we&#x27;ll need less land for parking. My hope is that on-street land can be given over to wider sidewalks, better quality bicycling infrastructure, and dedicated transit right-of-way, which will make those modes even <i>more</i> competitive.<p>In part because I&#x27;ve been personally touched by the mass slaughter on our roadways, I left a career in information security to retrain / work as an urban planner focussing on transportation. Oddly, the nearishness of self-driving vehicles is pushing me back in the direction of my former career. I&#x27;m bullish enough on the potential of self-driving vehicles to remake the economics and safety of transportation that I&#x27;m now pursuing a PhD researching privacy / security aspects of the &quot;smart city&quot;--including on-demand mobility services.

We struggle to survive from paycheck to paycheck, without million-dollar annual bonuses or second homes. We often work behind the scenes—or counters, getting little of the credit for billions of dollars in company profits.&quot;<p>I feel bad, but why is a mother of four still working a minimum wage job at Mcdonalds?  Minimum wage was never meant to support an entire family (especially a family of four).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what more credit these workers want.  They don&#x27;t have that much responsibility.  Their job is to either put pre-cooked food in the fryer or accept money at the register.  They get a paycheck on time for a job completed.  This should be enough.<p>&quot;and many of those barely pay more than minimum wage.&quot;<p>So Mcdonalds is STILL paying more than minimum wage in many instances, and it&#x27;s not enough?  I like how this is buried in the article..even though the title would make you believe that they only pay minimum wage.<p>&quot;We’ll discuss how to escalate our fight for $15 an hour and a union.&quot;<p>I feel like basic economics has been lost.<p>An increase in only Mcdonalds wages, might work, but Mcdonalds would never do this because the prices would increase and couldn&#x27;t stay competitive anymore.<p>An increase in minimum wage would only decrease the spending power for everyone because goods and services that rely on minimum wage workers (which is pretty much everywhere), would be forced to increase their prices.<p>You can see examples of this in any country with a high minimum wage.  I went to Australia a few months ago and the cost of a combo meal at Mcdonalds was almost $10.  At this point, your spending power doesn&#x27;t really increase that much.",1406475348

8092920,comment,8089711,8091172,2,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;m on the fence about the notion of a profession for software &quot;engineers&quot;.  One thing that worries me is the uncertainty around who would establish credentialing (For instance, I was a math major - would a degree in computer science be required to sit for the exam?)<p>I do see more than a few benefits to it as well, though.  For starters, we&#x27;d be able to start treating each other as professionals.  I&#x27;ve been on both sides of the interview, and I personally don&#x27;t enjoy asking an experience programmer how to do programming exercises that clearly (there&#x27;s no way to spin this) just amount to testing whether the person has minimum competence.  I&#x27;m not questioning the value of knowing how to print a binary tree in order, but I actually think it becomes an almost degrading ritual after a while, and we all participate in it.   Do physicians have to re-study organic chemistry every time the interview for a new job, the way programmers wonder if they are going to need to explain how the JVM works, or explain in detail how a random forest works, or how to find long term probabilities in a markov chain, or answer questions about operating systems?  Personally, I would enjoy not having to re-load all that knowledge into &quot;exam ready&quot; memory in the weeks leading up to an interview (and having to be strategic about it, because I can&#x27;t afford to drop everything at my job and study for nothing but an interview for several weeks).<p>A genuine <i>professional</i> exam might cover the core, and it would (if done well) actually cover the issues that we, as a profession, have decided are critical.  Again, I&#x27;m not sure if this would work, or if it wouldn&#x27;t do more harm than good, it&#x27;s something that I find intriguing.  Suppose there really were a good, rigorous, highly regarded, professional exam (perhaps including an in-person component, as with nursing and medicine).  This might take the exam away from the whim of the employer and return it to the practitioners in the field.  Employers are still free to ask what questions they like, but they&#x27;d acknowledge that they&#x27;re re-examining a candidate on subject matter knowledge that was already validated by a group of professionals, <i>or</i> that they&#x27;ve decided to quiz heavily on subject matter that is outside that realm (in essence, acknowledging that they&#x27;re looking for niche expertise, and that this isn&#x27;t about verifying that someone isn&#x27;t a fraud).<p>I think we should acknowledge in our field just how grueling these &quot;exams&quot; are every time we apply for a new job.  People talk about how tough the bar exam is in California - it&#x27;s 18 total hours of exam over 3 days.  I&#x27;ve had periods of interviewing (at more than one company) that were about that long.  It takes a while to prepare for the bar, of course, but here were some of the topics I was asked about over 3 8+ hour day of interviews (total interview time for two different math oriented programming jobs…)<p>build a binary tree<p>traverse a binary tree<p>add a node<p>remove a node (describe how, answer questions, write a bit of code)<p>how to keep it balanced (some code, probing questions, but not obliged to write full code for red-black)<p>how to find the dual of the primal in linear programming, and explain the relationship<p>code up a singleton<p>identify the lack the strategy and factory patterns in a long if-then bit of code, show how to do it with patterns\nconvert a database table to a bunch of indicators (T/F)… is this strange?<p>find long term state of markov chain<p>model a shipping system as a graph and suggest how to optimize it mathematically<p>detect a cycle in a linked list<p>convert a linear program into something that can be solved with dynamic programming (i.e., it didn&#x27;t need to be an optimization, it could be solved with a greedy algorithm)<p>print all permutations of a string, using recursion<p>swap two integers without creating a third variable (asked over lunch)<p>There were also interviews with management, and so forth.  I can&#x27;t possibly tell you if this was worse than the bar, but it took years of preparation, and I failed to get an offer from either company. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I didn&#x27;t rock the tech interview. I was busy at the time and also had a full time job to do (and a young child to take care of at home).  I&#x27;ve taken exams on everything listed above at one point or another.  People talk about the &quot;low barriers to entry&quot; for programming, as if legal licensing barriers are the only kind.  Barriers to entering programming are pretty heavy, and they can be capricious.",1406473478

675653,comment,675488,675630,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"Part of the problem is that everyone is so certain particularly on the side that man-made global warming is real and a serious threat. This probably the biggest cause I have for doubting it. The philosophy of science is very interesting to me and one thing that's a recurring theme is the discussion of the limits of empiricism. Another thing to consider is the awful track record of prediction from virtually everyone who is deemed to be an expert. I find it difficult to take seriously people who don't make serious room for their margins of error and who rely on computer models of the future to predict.<p>All that being said the people who promote global warming as a serious issue that we need to do something about could be right of course. It could also be that they're missing some key piece of information that they don't even know exists. The unknown unknowns here seem impossible to get your head around for something as difficult to understand as climate change.<p>I'm not sure where you find information that isn't biased one way or another on this topic.

On this storage, you put things like your database and other dynamic content that you expect to persist through a reboot of the box, which reverts back to its base image.<p>You need to configure a couple of boxes at least, one to act as a load balancer, and another to act as the content provider.  For more laden sites than mine, you might also need a separate instance for just the DB.<p>You are going to eat the cost of static IPs for at least a few boxes, but that's pretty cheap.  Configure those IPs to be in your load balancer always.  They'll fail when they're down, but that shouldn't be an issue.<p>At this point, you can have basically as many boxes available as you have previously allocated, and bringing them online is as simple as turning them on.  You could probably use CloudKick to dynamically bring them online, but I haven't really played with it to know.<p>If you need scaling past that allocation, you can bring up more instances (the bottleneck will of course be the DB), and register them with the load balancer as you need.",1246032679

I would argue that the latter is more relevant for ordinary people.

To make the transition easier, the word ""year"" could be deprecated entirely, and the unit of time would simply be called ""kiloday"" or ""k-day"".

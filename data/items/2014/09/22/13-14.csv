Besides, the idea that upgrading to iOS 8 as part of the bug fix cycle is a remnant of the days when OS upgrades were big, expensive and hard. If the lifecycle of the iPad in an Enterprise is three years (a guess), there&#x27;s a documented trend that Apple will release OS updates for three year old hardware. Instead of patching 7 forever, push the latest OS update. End users are happier, which makes leadership happier.",1411394385

8350534,comment,8347269,8348578,1,0,vidarh,,,"Consider that &quot;back then&quot; it&#x27;s popularity was unheard of in the markets where it did well, and markets were very segmented in terms of which products did well where.<p>Nobody in my class in Norway had a game console through most of my primary school years, but a substantial number had a Commodore 64, with a smattering of Spectrums, possibly an Amstrad, and some unlucky soul (because he&#x27;d have a hard time finding software of any kind for it in Norway) with a TRS-80 - popularly nicknamed Trash-80.<p>I&#x27;ve to date never seen an Atari 2600 in real life. Nor, for that matter, have I ever seen a pre-Mac Apple machine in person.<p>The original NES was showcased in my local store, but it was a curiosity that most of us interested in computing looked at with derision, and it was alone in a sea of home computers that we&#x27;d hang around and frustrate the staff by typing in all kinds of program on - some which I&#x27;m sure were appreciated for attracting attention, some less so..<p>The market was also of course vastly smaller at the time, and so millions of units was a huge deal. When the C64 came, we were on a waiting list for weeks to get it. A waiting list of a few hundred people nationwide, and that was considered exceptional even in our relatively small market.<p>Another aspect was that sharing software happened mainly by tapes and floppy, in Europe for much longer than in the US because of a combination of stringent certification requirements for modems in some countries that drove up price, and per-minute charges even for local calls. That made it much more important for purchasing decisions whether or not you got the same computer as your friends - picking the model everyone had became more important than picking the best one available. For years after I got my first Amiga, this social aspect had me going back to my C64 regularly.<p>Game consoles were rarely even covered in the computer magazines I&#x27;d read, and it was first towards the end of the 80&#x27;s that they really started being noticed.<p>It took me many years before I realised how blinkered many sets of us were as home computer users when it came to recognising the other communities for other home computers because they were very often geographically separate from us. It&#x27;s first in recent years I&#x27;ve become aware of the phenomenon around Woz for example, as it is very much a mostly American thing even amongst hackers - Apple did very poorly in Europe until the Mac with a few exceptions. Amusingly, for many Europeans (somewhat dependent on country still), the heroes of the 8-bit and 16-bit age are still Americans, just from Commodore; especially from the Amiga years.<p>The communities were also segregated by time and circumstance. E.g. there was a fairly large Commodore community in Eastern Europe that remained vital years after the 8-bit Commodore computers were falling out of favour in Western Europe, driven by Commodore in one of their brighter moments realising they still had markets there for discounted near-EOL models that Western Europe and the US had moved on from, leading to oddities such as relative popularity of the C16/C116 in Eastern Europe and particularly Hungary despite being a flop almost everywhere else.<p>We&#x27;re starting to see good books about the individual communities - I&#x27;d really love a good book giving an overview and examining the differences.",1411394164

His highest cited academic paper (421 cites, which is a lot in law world) is titled &quot;The fourth amendment and new technologies: constitutional myths and the case for caution&quot;, so this is literally his domain of expertise, so maybe you might want to acknowledge the possibility that he knows what he is talking about.<p>3. He <i>actually changed his mind</i> based on additional evidence that was presented to him in the form of counterarguments. Given how rarely this happens, anybody capable of doing this in a public forum automatically gets +10 Respect points from me.<p>4. He has a technical background, as timsally pointed out, including mechanical engineering degrees. Now if he has such trouble grappling with the subtleties of cryptography and security threat models, maybe that is also partially our fault as security practitioners. We should acknowledge that.<p>5. I am aware that this all sounds like an elaborate appeal to authority, but given the cavalier way people are criticizing the author (as opposed to his arguments), I thought these facts should be stated.",1411394071

Who will know about it? If it&#x27;s HTTP REST and the request times out owing to poor request timeout tuning then you have to cascade that failure up the propagation &quot;chain&quot; to the original caller -- something a lot of projects fail to do properly.<p>Security, as you mentioned, is another bug bear.

First, in practice there are too many packages that don&#x27;t adhere to SemVer, or appear to do so but in reality are not sufficiently tested for SemVer to be of any use. Second, if your code depends on any package, you are ultimately responsible for every potential breakage whether due to upgrades, security flaws, or bugs.

And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting something.<p>I often find that if I&#x27;m not making any progress in a given area I&#x27;m practicing, a change in process helps.  There are at least two components to skill: practice and strategy.  Strategy is what you choose to practice, and skill can&#x27;t be had without both.  If you find your practice ineffective, what&#x27;s probably needed is a change in strategy.<p>If you want to write a book, then perhaps a revision of &quot;don&#x27;t break the chain&quot; is in order:  If your writing wasn&#x27;t coherent, practice making it coherent.  One idea would be to devote each week to writing a different chapter of your book.  That way, you&#x27;re still writing every day, but the focus changes each week, so that if you&#x27;re unhappy with the current week&#x27;s output, you have a higher chance of feeling better about next week.  I realize it&#x27;s hard to write a book in a nonlinear fashion (earlier chapters guide later chapters, almost by definition, so it&#x27;s tempting to try to perfect each chapter before moving onto the next) but the goal is to practice writing a book, not to write a good book on your first try.  Forcing yourself to hammer out a chapter per week will bring coherence, if not quality.  But quality is simply a matter of practice, so keep at it!",1411391102

You dismiss a whole page of text to such a simple argument ? That old stuff was better than the new ? Did you even read the article ?<p>There are measurable ways to look at games, and it&#x27;s actually very clear that while game hardware has been evolving very fast, game design and options left to the player have been decreasing exponentially with time.<p>Why do you think there&#x27;s a retro game movement? No, it&#x27;s not pure nostalgia, there are genuine reasons to prefer older games over the new ones we have in 2014. And in all media there are ups and downs, there are &quot;golden ages&quot; where stuff is discovered, invented, discovered, and darker ages where nothing much happens and it&#x27;s just rehashing the same thing over and over again. You see this kind of things in every form of culture, why would Gaming be any different? Why do you think Games would be linearly progressing towards an ideal state ?",1411391100

This works great with Chromium because you can easily drag multiple tabs between windows to organize things, and the shrinking tab bar encourages you to close things you don&#x27;t need. Doesn&#x27;t work so well in Firefox, where you have to manually drag each tab over one by one, doing so is kinda glitchy, and the scrolling tab bar makes it easier to just fill a window with a ton of unrelated tabs.",1411391085

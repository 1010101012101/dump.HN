He provides hundreds of loosely related anecdotes, reminding me of the Talmud quote that 'when a debaters point is not impressive, he brings forth many arguments.'  I actually agree with a lot of Taleb, such as the intractability of risk because it is endogenous, and I think he's vaguely libertarian, but he says so many inconsistent things that doesn't mean much (when he's right it's probably a good example of the Gettier problem).""<p>Gettier problem = whether being right by accident still counts as being right.<p><a href=""http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/taleb-mishandles-fragility.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/taleb-mishandles-frag...</a>",1354406386

4859489,comment,4858715,4859297,17,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually yes, well actually approaching zero, and I realize it doesn't sound right. The cognitive dissonance comes from the economics of information, they work differently than the economics of goods.<p>Imagine this thought experiment. Imagine there was a 100% fool proof copy protection scheme in China, and the only way to acquire Microsoft Office would be to buy it. Try to imagine how many people, who make $1000 in a year would then cough up the $495 to buy it?<p>Its not hard to imagine because there is no manufactured good in China that commands a 'half annual salary' value proposition that is not critical to a person's survival. And Microsoft Office isn't that item.<p>There is an exemplar that there <i>is</i> a $6M value for Word based on the $2 CDs that sell, so its not 'valueless.' And there are benefits to owning a legitimate copy over a pirated copy. Further, the cost of producing a pirated product (box, CD, getting started guide, etc) is <i>less</i> than $2 so there actually a real-goods sort of economic value analysis possible as well.<p>So all we really know is that the number is >= $2 and < $495. And in information economics this poses an interesting challenge. How do you capture the maximum value for your information? Microsoft later introduced a plan where Office for this market was <i>significantly</i> less expensive than it was for the US and European markets [1]. That increased the value they extracted for office out of those markets tremendously. It was more than 10x that $1.50 price at $29/CD. And they captured a lot of value for it, millions and millions of dollars. But not <i>billions</i> of dollars.<p>Many have argued that much of NetFlix's streaming revenue has come from previous BitTorrent users [2]. Prior to NetFlix you could say BitTorrent was a ""$xB"" problem where $x is the money that has been re-captured by offering an alternative with an acceptable price.<p>But to understand how that works you have to think about what gives information value, its much more market driven that fiat driven. Sony can say ""Its worth $X to own this movie"" but if nobody buys it and it is heavily pirated they guessed wrong. Since the replication cost is nearly $0 they really are guessing at consumer value. Lots of DVDs sell for $9.99 or $4.99. At that price I won't even bother looking for a torrent, I'll just get the DVD. Its a market, it has different mechanisms that drive it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/23/microsoft-china-discount-idUSPEK1362420080923"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/23/microsoft-china-di...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2011/05/17/netflix-p2p-traffic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2011/05/17/netflix-p2p-traffic/</a>",1354406311

Smartphones, computers, things like that will all go inside your head (if you're willing, and most everyone will be).  Soon we will become tired of living in houses with blank walls upon which are projected whatever we want and, because we can do so, will revert back to more ancient styles of architecture and furnishings (with a couple of blank walls or two).<p>Your stove may look like a wood burning stove, and your fridge may look like a 50's model.  Why?  Because when almost EVERYTHING is 3D printed to your specifications, people are free to make things that function in a modern way but look like what <i>they</i> want them to look, rather than how the manufacturer's marketing department deems they should look.<p>I think transport will be dominated by self-driving vehicles, but again: think of individual styles.  I predict quite a few autonomous ""horseless coaches"" driving around our cities.<p>Speaking of cities...<p>My hope is that high speed network access will be everywhere, and population densities will equalize as more and more people prefer to live a rural life even while they do cutting edge professional or academic work.  There will still be slums and there will still be poor people, but I think that the majority of people who live in cities will do so because they really <i>want</i> to.<p>Further out, I can see even things like traditional healthcare completely disappear.  Sure, we may always have emergency trauma centers and doctors, but it's not to hard to fathom a time where a colony of self-replicating bio-robots and ongoing genetic engineering work 24 hours a day inside your body to keep it healthy and let you know of any real trouble before it becomes serious.<p>This is not to say that all these predictions will come true, only that the disappearance of electronic gadgets into the mind and into fabrics, paint, and the air seems inevitable, as does the radical differentiation of physical <i>things</i> like furniture, houses, and vehicles that will certainly come from the 3D printing/replication revolution (if that occurs).",1354405863

In order for Google to actually understand these, the people at Google must manually code for this sort of query, unlike other queries where results are automatically generated. And even then, Google doesn't really ""understand"" them, it just knows what to spit out when the query is a match. Google has some stuff manually coded in like this, but it's almost impossible to include everything, especially when people can say ""places to eat that are open now near my house"" vs. ""restaurants open near here"" vs. hundreds of other possibilities. That's the first layer of difficulty. More difficulty comes with finding the search user's location, determining what stores are actually restaurants (is a lunch deli a restaurant at 8pm?), etc. Then for example, determining which restaurants can deliver that are open now is another difficulty.<p>That said, I'd bet that Google will be able to handle these queries well in 1-3 years.",1354405766

4859433,comment,4859132,4859132,38,0,michaelochurch,,,"First of all, I disagree. The future <i>will</i> be cool, at least in the long term. What it won't be is <i>weird</i>, in the sense of people wearing spacesuits in their living rooms. The bizarre visions people have traditionally had of the future (and which, demonstrably, haven't come true) seemed to focus largely on superficial stuff (clothing fashions, which are highly unpredictable but have a long-term mean-reversion) and to exaggerate. That doesn't mean that the world hasn't changed, and won't change, in profound ways.<p>Yes, the pleasures of life (wine, music, books, sex, spiritual experience) don't change all that much and therefore we use a lot of old technologies in daily life, so it can appear like there's nothing new... but there will be more people able to afford them, and they will be much less impeded by the stupid shit that clogged up peoples' lives in pre-technological times. Just to continue Taleb's example: in the 21st century, a lot of people get to drink wine of (by historical standards) exceedingly high quality. Three millennia ago, wine existed but the vast majority of people never got to drink any.<p><i>Many of the modern applications that have managed to survive today came to disrupt the deleterious effect of the philistinism of modernity, particularly the 20th century: the large multinational bureaucratic corporation with empty suits at the top; the isolated family (nuclear) in a one-way relationship with the television set, even more isolated thanks to car-designed suburban society [...]</i><p>I'm going to stop there with the quote. His point is valid, but I think there's something missed when people rip on suburbia. Yes, it's outmoded and wasteful and somewhat ugly, but the Levittowns were a lot better than the ""company towns"" of early-industrial hell, and those were a lot better than being a serf on a medieval enclosure, in a time when it wasn't uncommon for a peasant to have his head cut off by a knight (knights were more like warlords than the noble paladins of romance). People tend to compare the experiences of average people now against those of an elite in the past and conclude that things were better, but that's not fair. The 1800-era analogue of a bored suburbanite of 50th-percentile social status (only one car!) was not an English baron, but someone who started work at seven in the coal mines.<p>People rip on suburbia now because it's outmoded, but it wasn't always this way. Urban freeways are called ""parkways"" because the vision of Robert Moses (in hindsight we say, ""That fucker!"", but he was very respected in his time) was for them to be park-like roads for an automotive elite. In the 1920s, suburbia was very much <i>in</i>. The suburban lifestyle, with lots of driving, was designed for the rich and handed down, over a couple of decades, to the working classes in a watered-down form. The result now, almost a century later, is that ""suburbia"" is no longer cool because the low-quality suburbs of the poor have killed the image of the concept.<p>Oddly enough, has anyone ever noticed how rich people suburbs aren't called that? The Hamptons isn't ""suburbia"". The Woodbury towns out there are ""charming little towns"" rather than suburbs, because the rich people who live there have enough time to make zoning rules that keep a quaint little street or two alive. These people aren't morally superior for having houses in high-price towns that still have walkable main streets as opposed to ""suburbs"". They're just richer.<p>One thing I find interesting is that Ted Kaczynski (Unabomber) wrote an essay about technology and alienation, while most of his complaints were of the industrial-era society, not the <i>technological</i> society we evolved into. He was miserable because, in spite of his extreme intelligence and adept writing, he had no real influence in a world run by corrupt corporate institutions. So he went out and killed people in order to effectively force the New York Times to publish his rant. If he had waited 15 years and not killed people, he would have had the public access and attention he craved. He might have trolled a bit, but no one would have died. Technology was just about to solve many of the problems that had him so upset-- that he blamed on industrial society.<p>My view of technology and progress is that it's nearly monotonic in ""goodness"", but that the old humanity we're now trying to distance ourselves from is quite tenacious and willing to use technology toward pre-technological purposes, and so the long-term convergence toward democracy that we'd like to see doesn't come nearly as fast as we'd like. For example, one might like to believe that, in an electronic world, old-style industrial pressures like taking orders from managers, showing up in an uninspiring white-box office during certain hours, and writing TPS reports would vanish... but human nature is a certain way and power likes to maintain position, so the transition is actually taking decades rather than the hours that it ""should"". The result of this is that the technological push toward a better world appears to collapse into an unsatisfying half measure and people end up having to use technology in uninspiring ways (e.g. getting to write code, but still having to take orders from non-technical executives or ""product managers""). That's not technology's fault. That's an artifact of humans being slow to improve themselves.",1354404995

Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property."" Thomas Jefferson<p>""The ordinary subjects of property are well known, and easily conceived...

IE9+, or even if you don't use IE, a modern trident for all apps that embed mshtml. The new task manager in Windows 8 is legitimately useful. GetTickCount64() is guaranteed to exist. The wonderful Consolas font.<p>None of which, by themselves, are a particularly compelling reason to upgrade. But Windows 7 is absolutely a worthy successor if you ever do decide to rebuild your system in the future, and with ~3G of ram the performance implications will be negligible (they're negligible on much weaker hardware than yours).",1354403873

Ultimately the heat must be transferred out somehow. In modern reactor designs these systems are usually designed to passively for very long times. With CANDU's it is very likely to be the case too.<p>In nuclear engineering one must always consider also the chance, that not everything is working as designed (like the destroyed diesel generators and external power sources at Fukushima). PRA (Probabilistic Risk Analysis) is used for that. PRA analysis are used for detecting most vulnerable systems in a nuclear power plant and this information is used to design new safer reactor types and to update the old ones little by little to be still safer. Harsh weather, seismic activity etc. is also considered in these analysis, but sadly in Fukushima even detected vulnerabilities didn't lead to improvements in time.<p>Even, if everything is done as well as possible, there is still a chance (although with modern designs almost arbitrarily small) that under certain conditions all the safety systems will fail. An ultimate example of such an event, would be a 100 km meteorite smashing the plant to atoms.",1354403834

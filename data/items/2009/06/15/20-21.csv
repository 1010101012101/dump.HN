If you mean ""I have no active enjoyment or dislike"", you need to go more for a word like ""ambivalent"".<p>I'm not convinced this is an English problem, or even a human problem, though. The problem is the low resolution being used; no matter how fine your stated opinion, if it is being viewed through a low resolution sensing device, it'll get aliased to one of the things the sensing device can actually perceive. (This is also the correct definition of ""bias"", though that would take a bit longer to describe.) It takes cognitive energy to increase resolution, so a lot of times we'll use ""love/hate"" as the only two options pretty casually, because it's easy and we don't have an infinite supply of cognitive energy.<p>(A number of terms in that paragraph are sort of ill-defined but it would take a lot of time to really nail them down.)",1245098527

659042,comment,658221,659031,0,0,foldr,,,"""Rudder reversal"" is just a particular kind of rudder movement. There are many different problems with an aircraft which could lead to rudder reversal occuring.<p>As mentioned in the article, pilot-commanded rudder reversal is relatively easy to obtain on older airbus models because they have very sensitive rudder pedals. This is not an issue on Boeing aircraft. As I said, I think you are recalling the problem that certain Boeing aircraft have with uncommanded rudder reversal, but although this is an equally serious problem, it is not the /same/ problem. In particular, there is no evidence that boeing aircraft have insufficiently strong vertical stabilizers. (In the rudder reversal incidents, the stabilizer remained in tact IIRC, it was the loss of control that was problematic.)",1245098134

Imagine if an industry sprang up that relied on such people, resulting in a dense population of super-geeks. So dense that they started breeding little geeks. If autism is genetic, as it we are starting to believe it is, would this not cause an increase in the cases of people being born with traits from the autistic spectrum?</i><p>This theory was proposed in a paper by Simon Baron-Cohen (ref: <a href=""http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Systemizers-Have-A-Higher-Risk-Of-Children-Suffering-From-Autism-7432-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Systemizers-Have-A...</a>). His study showed that children of ""high-systemizers"" were more likely to be autistic. If this is true, it would explain quite a bit. The rise in autism rates seems to match the growth of the tech industry and the value of ""knowledge workers.""",1245097070

There's no suggestion that an uncommanded rudder reversal occurred in this crash. The suggestion is that pilot-commanded rudder inputs put the rudder beyond its structural limits. Thus, the issue is one of the structural strength of the vertical stabilizer. This was not the primary issue in the Boeing incidents (the stabilizer remained in tact in most cases but the planes were in serious trouble anyway since they were pretty much uncontrollable).<p>In short, while Boeing and Airbus both have rudder-related problems, they are different problems. Boeing have an issue with uncommanded rudder movements, whereas Airbus' older models (if the author is correct) have the problem that it is too easy for pilot-commanded rudder inputs to put the plane beyond its structural limits. This problem can surface on the newer models if the fly-by-wire systems go down.",1245096799

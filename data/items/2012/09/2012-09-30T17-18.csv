I even quoted the relevant numbers.<p>Of the 252 drugs that were approved, 118 were regarded as ""scientifically novel"" (not me-too drugs or minor modifications of existing drugs).  They also did another cut where they looked at FDA ""priority approvals"", which basically means the FDA was willing to fast track the approval because the disease the drug was treating had no effective treatment.<p>As to your second question, over 60% of the scientifically novel therapies were discovered by pharma/biotech.  They would have received no government funding for their research.  The remaining 40% or so were discovered in university labs, of which a certain percentage were discovered via gov't funding (don't forget that industry-academic partnerships also make up a certain percentage of university funding).",1349027985

If they use it to lie and suggest their interests are aligned in ways they aren't or in other deceptive ways then yeah that's creepy but in a way that is actually independent of the so-called ""e-stalking"".  It would still be creepy if they learned the information they used from a friend or whatever other old-school method.<p>If, on the other hand, the person sees on Facebook that you're a huge fan of some hobby and they too are actually a huge fan of some hobby and they mention that, I don't see that as being creepy at all, but again YMMV.",1349027614

If the original 2009 spec had remained, or been better to begin with, we might have had decent adoption among non-IE and mobile browsers.

Rails provides infinitely better tools in a better language than PHP.<p>You're making a highly subjective and unqualified comparison of a language to a framework, and (given past citations in similar discussions) probably using information to do so that's at least five years out of date. This after saying you're a python dev so presumably not especially well versed in either language/framework (do correct me if I'm wrong)<p>Like you say, there's a lot of bad code out there. PHP is notorious for it due to its shallow learning curve and widespread availability on cheap servers. The authors point is that the barrier to entry on ruby/rails appears to be quickly dropping and asks whether it will suffer the same fate.",1349024466

8056821,comment,8054570,8054570,1,0,codeonfire,,,"Before I moved to a tech hub I lived in a flyover state.  Whenever I interviewed at companies there, the developers would be so down.  They seemed almost depressed like they had nowhere to go.  Invariably the management was unsophisticated and not very experienced.  Their thinking about software Dev management was decades behind.  Do you want to know what development was like in the 70s or 80s when programming was a blue collar job? Go work in one of those states.<p>At one point I realized the entire state and region had nothing for me and left.  I still get job leads from that place from 80s era companies and I know following them means booting up dos from a floppy or doing COBOL work while being told what to do by a part time manager, part time truck driver.  What is far worse though is the fear of being sucked into this microcosm of &#x27;this is how we do it here&#x27;. There are no up to date companies out there, only companies that have found a local maxima of expertise that, though they don&#x27;t know it, is five to ten years behind at best.  You tend to get stuck being lectured by the so-called experts on some 10 year old technology that is state of the art in their minds.",1405749589

It has nothing to do with the advancement of technology, technology only increased their power to the point where they couldn&#x27;t be easily ignored anymore. It is the absence of law. Or, at least law as we understand it from a civillian perspective. It is power that comes only from the executive branch and is monitored only by the upper tiers of power, not by typical political oversight.<p>Spies operate in a different moral and legal environment than civilians are used to, which makes it hard to understand when daylight is shone on them.

While it seems about everything that America invents winds-up in the legal system, the idea that D&D could have been an &quot;empire&quot; is just wrong-headed. D&D expanded regardless of TSR&#x27;s smooth moves or missteps because it has always been a very player-driven game, the ultimate user-generated-content-game really. Just as much and for the same reasons, D&D never had that much potential to become that much larger than it did become. Only a certain type of person would play the game and not very much would stop them from playing. Some company might make more or less money from this culture but the size of the culture pretty strictly limits the profits involved.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that D&D 3.5 was released with an &quot;open gaming license&quot; and thus the game was forked by the Paizo company who maintain their Pathfinder system closer the original game than the present D&D 4.0 released by now-Hasbro-owned Wizards Of The Coast, which just reinforces that no single company is likely to create or destroy D&D-like role-playing.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game</a>",1405747988

The period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500 years for Arabic, 2000 years for the Romance languages. Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the Maghreb, a linguistically innovative variety such as Moroccan Arabic is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the Mashriq, much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers.

8056760,comment,8054983,8056715,2,0,kaitai,,,"> I have never been asked to do anything this in a math class.<p>This is a tragic comment. It is also true. American children waste their time and their brains in American math classes for about 8 years each. They learn to multiply and maybe solve a quadratic equation. &quot;Equations are sometimes called theorems,&quot; and that&#x27;s it. And it&#x27;s not getting better; as a culture, we don&#x27;t understand or respect math so we don&#x27;t support it.<p>Modern mathematicians don&#x27;t memorize or drill steps. We don&#x27;t just find a bigger number each day by adding one. We hold our problems, trace them, ask ourselves how the proof should be designed and figure out where the problems in the logic are. If you&#x27;ve got 2n points in a line, how many ways can you draw a curve from one point to another such that you match them all up and none of the curve intersect? What about if they&#x27;re in a circle -- is the answer different? How do you characterize a straight line if you&#x27;re in a non-Euclidean surface? What&#x27;s the right definition of straight -- should straight mean &quot;direction of derivative is in direction of line&quot; or &quot;shortest distance&quot; or what? And if we&#x27;re talking about points on a grid, how should distance be measured anyway? Do we have the right definitions to solve our problem? Distance from streetcorner to streetcorner by cab in Manhattan is different than distance as the crow flies is different than &quot;distance&quot; through time and space; how are the concepts consistent, then?<p>Formulas are just shorthand for relationships. We don&#x27;t teach students the relationships or the thinking in the US. That&#x27;s why my Romanian advisor would ask our graduate algebra class, &quot;You should have learned this in high school, no? No...

That&#x27;s why I think that the specifics of the linked-to proposal won&#x27;t work. But, I think the general idea is worth investigating. It just requires some user research.<p>Also, the fact that browsers support a non-HTTPS mode at all is really the bigger UI issue. Imagine if HTTPS was the only option. The biggest UI security problems would instantly vanish! That&#x27;s a big reason why a lot of people are actively working so hard on finding ways to make HTTPS work for everybody on every site.",1405746385

8056752,comment,8056329,8056329,12,0,mindcrime,,,"OK, raise your hand if the reason you don&#x27;t go to movies is because the screens aren&#x27;t big and bright enough.<p>Right, thought so.<p>This is cool and all, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s going to save the movie theater business, or the movie industry.  I don&#x27;t even <i>have</i> a fancy home theater and I&#x27;d rather watch movies at home, on my shitty laptop screen, than go out to the movies on the majority of occasions.  The thing keeping me from going out is more to do with the cost (of the movie), the overpriced concessions, the 30 minutes of commercials and previews before the movie, the lack of a &quot;pause&quot; button so I can go take a wizz, the talking people in the row in front of me, the idiot behind me who keeps kicking the back of my seat, etc., etc., etc...<p>And note that these guys are looking at this as justification for <i>raising</i> ticket prices.<p>I just don&#x27;t see it.  OK, sure, hardcore cinemaphiles will go and slobber over this, but is the average movie-goer <i>really</i> going to care that the screen is a bit bigger, or that the color depth is a bit better?  My guess is &quot;no&quot;.<p>But hey, more power to them.  But if you want more of my money, you&#x27;re going to have to find a way to deliver a better experience, and bigger and brighter screens aren&#x27;t going to do it.",1405746307
8056751,comment,8054983,8056700,1,0,superuser2,,,"The qualifier was important.<p>If, by arguing that math skills are important to programming, you mean &quot;skills in post-Calculus math&quot; than <i>say so</i>. If you say &quot;math,&quot; people will continue to believe that you mean math in the way that they experienced it, i.e. math ending at or shortly after calculus.<p>Lots of mathematicians freely admit that they&#x27;re terrible at computation. Which is precisely my point - the two represent <i>different skills</i>. Being good at symbol manipulation (i.e. &quot;math&quot; as represented by your high school transcript, SAT, ACT, and college transcript if not a math major) is not a determinant of your aptitude as a programmer.<p>Is it useful to study math beyond calculus? Of course! I know (abstractly) that things like the typed lambda calculus and set theory exist and are the foundation for much of what we do. However, it is ignorant to talk about these things like they&#x27;re related to your aptitude for pre-Analysis math.<p>But what it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> is rational to to use performance in lower math classes to screen (computer science undergrad applicants|interns|programmers), or to encourage people to choose or not choose programming as a career path based on their performance in mathematics classes.<p>Basically, I side with Lockhart&#x27;s Lament. <a href=""https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament....</a>",1405746265

If one want&#x27;s be be even more pedantic you can also point out there are implementations of Ethernet that employ the same technology at a switching level.<p>What really makes the big difference though is the presence of the subnet manager. Which pre-programs the routing information into each switch at fabric bring-up time. This is what causes Infiniband to act like a circuit switched network despite ofcourse being VCT at the PHY layer.",1405746252

I've been running an ad-blocking add-on for Firefox for a long time, and it seems to work pretty well at keeping ads invisible from me. I also do various forms of cookie clean-up periodically to keep my browsing behavior from being tracked by advertisers, and use multiple layers of email spam filtering.<p>Do you like to read advertisements on websites? Do you click through on them from time to time? What ads do you like best? What ads am I missing that I should know about?",1239926210

You can take that argument up with psychologists themselves.<p>Your arguments against correlation are pretty much what I was trying to cover with my parenthetical. You aren't decrying correlation, you're decrying popular misapprehensions about correlation, ones which I don't share. The correlation is present and the statistical analysis is simple; nobody can point at the g factor in one single test, but the statistical tests that show it is there is Statistics 101-type stuff.<p>The science is clear. Take it up with the scientists. You can start by searching for ""g factor"". (I recommend the quotes be included.)",1239926145

566118,comment,565479,565479,0,0,psb217,,,"This is the wrong way to go. I would guess that high-speed trains will only reduce people's reliance on airplanes, which are themselves a form of mass-transit. This particular change should be easy to effect, as many casual travelers will be swayed by the (hopefully) greater convenience of train travel versus the airport hassle.<p>However, many who are over-reliant on their cars will continue to be so, as they are less likely to be the people traveling frequently by plane. Also, people will have no incentive to reduce their car dependence so long as they still have to drive everyday for work/groceries/practically everything, unless they are lucky enough to already live in one of the rare (at least in the USA) cities with public transportation that could be rationally argued as superior to individual cars.<p>So, I would argue that massive investment in intra-city public transport infrastructure would have a more significantly positive long-term effect, as its availability would be relevant to more people, and has a the potential to cause a significantly larger reduction in the number of miles driven per person in the USA.<p>Unfortunately, the negative stigma that seems to linger over public transport in many parts of this country would likely retard these benefits. The real utility of the simple bus systems that would be a reasonable first step, as opposed to metros/subways, would not become apparent until the use of mass-transit reached a critical mass, at which the density of cars on the road would be reduced to a point allowing buses to travel quickly. Though, the importance of reaching this critical mass, which creates a sort of chicken<->egg problem, could be reduced by dedicated bus lanes, as some others have already mentioned.",1239925566

Employment is understood to be a lagging indicator in economic circles, and this principle is well reflected in the graph data.  We now know that the recession started in Q4 07, but you do not see red in the data until '08.<p>Hence, it is perhaps better to read ""X jobs created/lost nationwide since YYYY"" as ""We were creating/losing jobs at a rate of X per year in YYYY"".<p>Why?

When you create a UTM at time t=1 it's only universal at time t=1, because at time t=2 the information content of the universe has increased, and now you have the TM formerly known as universal.<p>At first it struck me as absurd: ""you can't build a computer for functions that don't exist."" Um, right. But that's exactly it. Tomorrow there will exist functions that don't exist today.<p>Or, from the classification/sensor perspective: ""choose any number, I can then add 1 to it and my number will be larger than yours."" Um, yeah. But again the UTM is part of the universe and therefore can't contain more information than the universe. Tomorrow the quantity of information in the universe will have increased and your formerly universal TM will fail.<p>The speed issue is kind of a red herring. If you created the ultimate cisc computer that could compute the entire universe in a single clock cycle it would be constrained by size rather than speed. And tomorrow it would fail.",1239924401

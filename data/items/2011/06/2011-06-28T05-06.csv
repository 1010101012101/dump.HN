2704239,comment,2703564,2704146,8,0,ajkessler,,,"You're pretty much spot on.  After taking several copyright courses in law school, I can definitively say that the whole area of law is a clusterfuck.  Even the seminal cases aren't consistent, let alone those on the periphery.  Sadly, most of the closer cases seem to come down the a single judge's gut feeling.  If either side has deep enough pockets, they can force the case to come down to a panel of judges' gut feelings, but even the Circuit courts hold wildly inconsistent rulings.  I'm not bashing judges here: the law here isn't so much a guideline as it is guide posts.  It's not surprising that there's not much consistency.<p>It's really frustrating for anybody trying to create.  It can even be frustrating for the lawyers trying to practice in the field.  I ran across this insightful, if slightly biased, post by William Patry, a fairly famous copyright lawyer, explaining his decision to shut down his personal copyright-based blog.  He explains the decision as being partly motivated by the landscape of copyright law: <a href=""http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2008/08/end-of-blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2008/08/end-of-blog.html</a>",1309240692

A real programmer is free to optimize and release memory before that, even if the object still has references.<p>In practice, I doubt the difference matters. The primary focus of memory management in C/C++ is avoiding leaks from objects that were never freed and <i>can never be freed</i> because all their references are out-of-scope.

2704185,comment,2704148,2704148,2,0,dcpdx,,,"Hey there.  What I've done in the past is make a long list of words that could be applied to what your company does, how it does it, who it's designed for, etc.  Grab a thesaurus and look up synonyms for words that are particularly applicable. Then, start combining different words and see what you come up with.  Swap some vowels (a's for e's, o's for i's, etc.) and get creative.  Eventually, you'll come up with a list of names that are at least partially relevant to what your company does and hopefully look and sound decent.  You may want to search for words in other languages as well (Latin is a good one) for more variety.  It takes a long time to come up with a great name that you and your team like, that is at the same time not trademarked and also has a domain available relatively cheap.<p>No matter how arbitrary a name sounds, it almost always has direct meaning for the company.  Google was originally called 'Googol', which is a very large number (10 to the hundredth power) and was meant to convey how much information Google indexed.  Twitter is perfect because it implies that the service is about short bursts of information (tweets) much like a bird chirping (would the name Chirpr sound as good? Naw).  You also have to think about how the name sounds when it's spoken, and if people can easily remember how to spell it when they go to type it in the address bar of their browser.<p>Guy Kawasaki wrote a decent article about naming companies a few years ago which you can find here: <a href=""http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_name_game.html#axzz1QXrOUxT9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_name_game.html#axzz1...</a> .  I can't agree with all of the points but there's some good stuff in there.  Whatever you do, don't compromise on a great name.  If you're embarrassed to tell people what your company is called, that's not a place you want to be in.  Take the time to do it right and you'll reap the rewards tenfold down the road.

I suppose it's been a while since I've argued it, so I might as well jump in.  :-)<p>It's incredibly naive to say that crappy code that gets the job done is generally good.  Ok, sure.  Sometimes you just have to roll up your sleeves and write an ugly hack to get the job done.  But if you keep it up, you spend more time maintaining the ugly hacks than you do coding new stuff.<p>So here's my advice:<p>1.  Stop.  <i>Breathe</i>.<p>2.  Think about what you're doing before you do it.<p>3.  Do it.<p>This has worked wonders for me.  It's incredible how easy it is to not write crappy code, and it pays off.  And for the record, I'm one of the biggest instant gratification junkies I know.  I'm not saying one needs to write good code because I don't want to get things done.",1309237981

It's a type of blog search engine with a graphical layout.<p>The most important thing to me was the availability of domain names.  I wanted a dot com, not a .ly .me .whatever else.  My intended audience includes lots of people who aren't necessarily the best with computers, and that audience still thinks dot com is the only thing out there.<p>Now I'll tell you the story.<p>I knew I the product had to do with blogs, so I tried to brainstorm names that had blog in it.  Obvious things like combining two words, e.g. blogcloud or blogstar, were all taken.<p>It suddenly occurred to me that I my product would help people ""circumnavigate the blog-o-sphere"" while I was out sailing with my dad.  This made me think of bloggellan (from Magellan).  This name had the unfortunate side effect of two g's next to each other.  So I brainstormed a bunch of other explorers and settled on Blogumbus (for Columbus).<p>I'm not sure yet how good of a name it is, but it's at least tolerable.",1309237908

4343,comment,4281,4321,0,0,bhb,,,"That's a good point. We don't have a strong network of angels, VCs, and other founders here in Denver. That's definitely a huge plus of the YC experience. I do wonder if we could build a network that would be good enough in the next few months, since we have a few good contacts and Denver/Boulder is pretty good for that type of stuff (admittedly, not as good as Cambridge or the Bay Area).<p>Again, not knocking YC, just weighing our options.",1173941244
4342,comment,4238,4241,0,0,danielha,,,"It's a good realization of ""release early and iterate."" Provide something good for your users and then listen carefully to what they have to say. That's way, way better than hiding in development for an overextended period, hypothesizing -- without foundation -- what new features are needed.",1173941124

4339,comment,3891,3891,0,0,zaidf,,,"For me school is a way to be connected to what is going on in the ""real world"". I entered school thinking it is EITHER school or entrepreneurship. But in last year my views have changed. I really think there is a middle path where you do JUST enough to stay in school all the while trying out new ventures. (May be the Steve Jobs route?)<p>School is an awesome platform to launch your site off and get quick feedback - ESPECIALLY if your venture fits in with the social networking ecosystem.",1173939923

4337,comment,4331,4331,0,0,danielha,,,"I never really thought of praising effort in this way. The examples provided to use in lieu of praise makes normal human interaction seem so deliberate and robotic. The author seems to imply that simply acknowledging someone's talent makes them less likely to make risks or innovate in fear of failing their image, I wonder if the author would also contend that, at the least, the person would continually strive to maintain the ""good"" image. In that case, that's certainly better than inconsistent performance.<p>Here's an audio interview with the author: <a href=""http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1011.html"">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1011.html</a>",1173939826

4335,comment,3891,3927,0,0,zaidf,,,"I gotta agree with you.<p>Though everything in this argument depends on the relativeness of things, in general I do think as ADD'd coders we love to simply code the next thing that comes to our mind. And that has its advantages. But as I've realized, it can be super healthy to explore the other end and instead of simply coding the first idea you get, to do few days of contemplation of making the initial idea better. <p>Get idea - Process idea - Code<p>I think there is too much of ""Get idea - Code it"" going on in this audience.

4329,comment,4281,4303,0,0,brett,,,"No, it's not anything you're missing, just your conclusion from the data given. In my opinion, if we're talking about value here, the negatives listed in that blog entry just don't stack up against the value add YC brings (e.g., as mentioned, connections, exposure, advice...). <p>That's not to say that YC is right for you. There are plenty of potential reasons that YC is not a good fit and obviously plenty of ways to succeed without them. Some of the negative points you bring up have a lot of bearing on your lives as founders and probably should be considered. I'm just skeptical that, were you accepted into the Summer Founders Program tomorrow, it would be a sound business decision to turn YC down. Then again, maybe there is something you know that I don't...",1173939008

There are a couple of ""lost arts"" that, when performed properly, prevent the things that OP calls ""your fault"".

This gives Yahoo an awesome position (at least for short term) with huge multiple benefits,such as #1 it can get best of the best deal possible either from google or MS (doesn't really matter who as far as good money shows up in yahoo's bank account), #2 these negotiations will put a speed breaker on Carl Ichan's bid for getting a new board (remember shareholder meeting is not far away, again it is all about timing) #3 if any deal is announced (whether with google or MS) before shareholder's meeting then yahoo's stock price will go up for sure and the chances are Carl Ichan will soften his position, #4 the deal (with google or ms) will make everyone happy with win win situation for all 3 important yahoo stake-holders (employees, end-users and shareholders) and #5 the biggest of all is if yahoo and google get in to a deal then stock prices will go up and yahoo will be then able to justify why they didn't budge to sell the company to MS - also now if at all MS wants to buy yahoo (even after a year) then they have to bow down to the price that yahoo wants, also remember this deal (between yahoo and google) will also make all 3 stake-holders happy. So by this analysis i think Yang is proving to be in a very strong position and he is smart enough to get the best out of these 2 bidders to make all 3 important stake-holders happy ....",1211204954

I'm still not able to start my own blog due to various reasons but one of the most is (and may be few of you might have already noticed) that my english grammar is not that good - i make silly mistakes and sometime it is really embarrassing, though that doesn't mean that i dont have good/valid ideas or thoughts to share and sometime it makes me uncomfortable because i know i can write on variety of topics from IT to movies to art to culture & society to current trends in business etc. so PLEASE HELP by sharing your views and experience. thanks.",1211204786

I actually have some background in coding, I wrote a couple of smaller projects over the past 2 years, so I am comfortable with php/html, and I think my illustrator/shop skills are coming together now as well. I actually built a version 1 with the yahoo store editor. It's ok, not totally satisfied with the design, but it works, and is clean as I could make it. As I am starting work on version 2.0, I find this editor to be a little frustrating not letting me customize some of the modules, and I want to make some of this database driven instead of a page for each product. I don't like the idea of their custom tables. Does this help with gauging where I am technically?",1211204542

The data suggest (with noted caveats) that developers are putting less relevant emphasis on installed base.<p>The main thing missing from the article is the number of developers developing for the web (exclusively or otherwise).

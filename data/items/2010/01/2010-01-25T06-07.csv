For instance, compare, selling new cars and high-end legal services; they are fundamentally different tasks requiring different skillsets.<p>Hence, you could quit programming and go and get an entry level sales job, stuff it up and end up hating sales and being in a worse position to start a business and make reasonable money.<p>On the other hand, if you build something that you believe in and think is fantastic it will be much easier for you to sell it.  This has two additional advantages:<p>a) Believing in what you're selling will make it easier for you to get over rejection, and<p>b) If what you've built isn't what the marketplace wants then you have the advantage of both direct contact with your market and the ability to directly alter your product so that it's something they'd like.<p>Finally it's easier to hire good sales people as a programmer than vice versa because sales performance is easily measured.",1264402791

The patent holders signed an agreement when creating the standard that <i>requires</i> them to license to you under reasonable terms.  As far as I know, <i>they cannot refuse</i>.  This is how the process is carried out for many international standards: nobody wants to risk one of the patent holders going rogue.<p>This is in contrast to something like FAT, which was created by Microsoft, for Microsoft, and is controlled entirely by Microsoft.<p>Quite honestly, I think many of the companies involved would welcome the end of software patents.  The amount of legal wrangling they go through in order to avoid legal problems is tremendous, and for H.264, the fee is a mere 10 cents per unit for bulk licensing with a relatively low cap.  Hardly enough income for them, IMO, to justify the hassle created by software patents.",1264402434

We feel confident that we are looking at the tablet device for two main reasons, that I can share with you. Also note that, as a company, we have experience tracking new Apple hardware devices in the past.<p>1) If this were an iPhone we were looking at, the hardware would tell us when we ask it (via the software). So we can rule out that this is an iPhone. Also, we already see verified iPhone devices testing OS 4.0 and these leave (Apple's Cupertino, CA) campus, whereas this device does not. This makes sense given the secrecy around the new tablet device as the launch event nears.<p>2) The apps being tested match up to what the devices is supposed to feature (e.g., news, books, etc.). We cannot share further detail here due to Terms of Service agreements we have with customers that use our service, but feel that if you were able to see the data we see, at the level of granularity, it would be clear to you as well.<p>Of course the truth will be revealed on Wednesday, but we wouldn't publish such a report without a high level of confidence.<p>Flurry is not interested in building a business on rumor, but rather authority, credibility and accuracy.</i><p>Point (2) seems less than rock solid, but (1) lends a bit of credence, especially since they've already seen iPhone OS 4.0 devices.

1074571,comment,1074477,1074477,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"<i>proprietary H.264 codec</i><p>Can people at least get their terminology right for once here?  That isn't what proprietary means, and conflating ""patented"" with ""proprietary"" simply serves to confuse people.<p>Many free software programs are covered by at least <i>some</i> patents--most, I would say, simply given the size of the patent minefield--and I wouldn't call them ""proprietary"".  It seems to me that ""proprietary"" has basically become an insult to be applied towards anything ""less free"" than what one wants to advocate.<p>A proprietary format has no standard you can freely read and implement.  At best it requires signing an NDA and/or paying tens of thousands of dollars to look at--at worst it doesn't even exist, with the ""standard"" being ""whatever the official implementation does"" (see Microsoft Word for a great example of this).  There are tons of these in video: RealVideo, for example, along with all of Microsoft's video formats before they finally opened up with VC-1.  Others include On2's video formats (e.g. VP6), Sorenson's (SVQ1, SVQ3), and many others.<p>One of the biggest dangers of this conflation is the understatement of the dangers that proprietary formats can cause.  There has never, ever been a lawsuit over an open source implementation of a ""patented-but-standardized"" file format--as far as I know, the common interpretation seems to be that the sellers and distributors of an application are responsible for any royalties, placing no restrictions whatsoever on the developers.  See LAME, for example.<p>But proprietary formats are different.  The law is very vague and conflicting on whether or not it is legal to even reverse-engineer such formats (it varies between countries as well).  Doing so almost always requires access to the disassembled binary of the original application, which violates the EULA and potentially the DMCA.  Developers can be hit with legal threats <i>merely for releasing source code</i>, as we saw with RTMPdump.<p>Of course, proprietary formats tend to be patented as well, resulting in a ""worst of both worlds"" situation.<p>Don't mix up the terminology, lest people be convinced that RealVideo or another proprietary solution is no more evil than a internationally standardized, albeit patented, option.  The greatest accomplishment in internet video in the past 10 years has been moving away from that horrendous mix of Quicktime, Windows Media, and Real that was used on almost every site on the internet.  Even if it means we've been stuck with Flash for playback until recently, it's better than that ridiculous mix of proprietary garbage.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1074237"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1074237</a> has a great example of what happens when proprietary and patented are conflated: a piece of proprietary crap can be promoted in place of a free software solution.",1264400234

But if the consumer consumes the product without paying because they couldn't afford it in the first place, can you really say that you lost money on that? If they didn't have the money to buy it in the first place, how could they have given you money for it if piracy wasn't an option?<p>The <i>real</i> cause of piracy (other than availability) is the over-saturation of media markets that we have. Example: If I want to buy a new video game for $60, that's maybe 4 or 5 CDs that I can't buy, so I download those CDs instead.<p>I know that some people will call it naive, but we live in a society where we are bombarded by marketing in which everyone tries to shout the loudest or find the best way to subtly convince you that you <i>need</i> their product (i.e. you won't be cool unless you have X). But we are now in a marketplace where the consumer can choose to pay for X and pirate Y instead of just deciding to (exclusively) buy X or Y. So it comes down to this: If everyone is able to convince me that their product is a necessity, then I'll end up acquiring all of those products, but only some of them will be paid for.<p>Note: I'm using a hypothetical 'me/I' in this explantion.",1264399986

I would fully expect to be sued if I did such a thing. Unless the conduct would also meet a jury&#x27;s definition of sexual harassment, and not just violate the internal policy, it&#x27;s a perfect libel case.<p>><i>And as for &quot;the worst kind of sexual predator&quot;, that seems more than a little extreme based on what&#x27;s been said, doesn&#x27;t it?</i><p>In  word: no. That is the impression I was left with based upon the actions they took. If it was worth destroying his reputation, as they did here, then in the absence of additional information we are left to assume the worst.<p>They could have easily not made this statement and just removed his classes from the site, or kept his lectures up and had another professor handle interactions.  They instead chose to publicly tar and feather him. That may or may not be justified, but we don&#x27;t have enough information to make that judgment. If his conduct was on the lower end of the sexual harassment spectrum (an &quot;online learner&quot; thought it was inappropriate that he asked her out, for example) then making this statement was uncalled for.

Still if you had done a search for &#x27;&quot;graduate student&quot; &quot;mental health&quot;&#x27; instead of complaining about anecdotes you would have found a few things more substantive:<p>According to <a href=""http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2014_02_04/caredit.a1400031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previou...</a> :<p>> According to a report from the University of California (UC), nearly half of graduate students said that a mental or emotional problem had interfered with their academic work in the past year. Yet, little is known about the mental health problems that affect graduate students, including those in science.<p>> In one of the few studies on the subject, ...  Nearly 40% of graduate students reported feeling hopeless during the previous year, 78.5% said they had felt overwhelmed, 27.2% said they had felt depressed, and 54.5% said they had felt stress over the past year ranging from “more than average” to “tremendous.”<p>> A 2006 report from UC paints a similar picture. About 60% of graduate students said that they felt overwhelmed, exhausted, hopeless, sad, or depressed nearly all the time. One in 10 said they had contemplated suicide in the previous year.<p>More details about that study are at <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2009/02/23/grad-school-fosters-depression/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2009/02/23/grad-schoo...</a> :<p>> 67 percent of graduate students said they had felt hopeless at least once in the last year; 54 percent felt so depressed they had a hard time functioning; and nearly 10 percent said they had considered suicide, a 2004 survey found. By comparison, an estimated 9.5 percent of American adults suffer from depressive disorders in a given year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.<p>The American Psychological Association, at <a href=""http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2012/01/heal.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2012/01/heal.aspx</a> , says &quot;87 percent of psychology graduate students reported experiencing anxiety, and 68 percent reported symptoms of depression.

It essentially served as a playpen for new OS/systems ideas and research at Bell Labs at the time.<p>A lot of those ideas were pretty influential: union mounts, per-process namespaces, user-space file systems, UTF8, human-readable protocols, rfork(), file-object interface ubiquity, concurrent programming model, etc. You can see how these ideas have pervaded our current systems landscape.<p>The implementation of Plan 9 itself is great, but I don&#x27;t think success of the Plan 9 project should be limited to whether or not its specific implementation stays current and modern. The UX was never designed with the common user in-mind, and it arguably was never the core focus for the system. A greater success would be to see its actual core ideas spread out into other mainstream systems.<p>So instead of making the Plan 9 UX more modern, why not work on getting some of its missing features into Linux instead? Last time I checked, Linux still needs a union-mount implementation.

That&#x27;s enough for a single, unmarried, childless person who is sharing an apartment with one or more roommates.<p>It was laughably low for someone like me, married with three children.  Health care alone in the US was about $1200/month for my family.  Rent was another $1200/month or so.  Food cost us a few hundred a month.<p>Not surprisingly, I ended up doing lots of consulting work during the PhD, something that I had to keep hidden from the program.  My wife&#x27;s earning potential was quite low, so this was the most economical way to do it, if not the most relaxing.<p>An OK salary is very much relative to the person receiving it, as well as the city in which you are living.  We were in Chicago, which is far less expensive than Boston or San Francisco.  I can&#x27;t imagine what we would have done there.",1418122976

I get the whole &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; thing, but it feels like a lot of people here are bending over backward to deny that sexual harassment might have happened.<p>And as for &quot;the worst kind of sexual predator&quot;, that seems more than a little extreme based on what&#x27;s been said, doesn&#x27;t it?

If she finds them sexist for asking her the question (as opposed to not asking), she must think they only asked because she&#x27;s female.  I don&#x27;t see how it can be read otherwise.  However, I don&#x27;t think this makes the lady an OTT feminist.<p>A possible workaround would be to provide a cheat-sheet with a rules summary.  I think one would be less likely to see or assume sexism if there are hard materials on offer to the interviewee - it implies that the same question and materials are used for a number of candidates, and an interviewer is unlikely to withhold the cheat-sheet just because an interviewee is male.",1418122908

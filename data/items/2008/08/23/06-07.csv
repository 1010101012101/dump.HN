284513,comment,284192,284471,0,0,agotterer,,,"Is there anything wrong with marketing? Sure on one hand you could say they ""sold out"". But underneath all the open source and hackers they are a company... a for profit company at that. They are pushing a product that is superior to the current standard and are forcing inovation that might have taken significantly longer had they not become a serious threat. So if a few tactics like setting world records helps spread the word and make the internet better, I'm all for it.<p>I would love to see Firefox become the industry standard. It will force other browsers to start playing by the rules, mainly living up to standards and working harder to make a better product. Competition is what creates better products. When you have a monopoly or are the only major player in an industry you aren't as innovative. You don't need to be. Look at the cell phone market pre iPhone... now everything is touch screen and has internet...",1219473723
284510,comment,283639,284442,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"His example is too incomplete to translate properly (since I don't know the details of other stuff he's referencing), but the basic idea is this:<p>A callable object in Python (e.g., a function or method, though not necessarily limited to these) can take advantage of two special options in declaring its argument signature. One is a feature shared between Python and Ruby: you can prefix the final argument with a single asterisk, which will be interpreted as ""accept any number of additional positional arguments, and store them as a list in a variable of this name"".<p>So, for example:<p><pre><code>    def print_args(*args):\n        for arg in args:\n            print arg\n</code></pre>\nWhich does pretty much what it looks like it should do; you pass any number of arguments, and it echoes them back, each argument printed on a separate line.<p>The other part is something Ruby doesn't really support, because Ruby doesn't have a true analogue of Python's keyword arguments: using a double asterisk says, essentially, ""accept any number of keyword arguments, and store them as a key/value mapping in a variable of this name"".<p>So, for example:<p><pre><code>    def print_keyword_args(**kwargs):\n        for key, value in kwargs.items():\n            print ""%s: %s"" % (key, value)\n</code></pre>\nIf you then did, say, `print_keyword_args(name='Bob', email='bob@example.com')`, you'd get back the output (ordering of items may vary with the Python implementation, but usually you're not concerned with ordering -- that's what positional arguments are for):<p><pre><code>    name: Bob\n    email: bob@example.com\n</code></pre>\nThese can also be combined into a standard idiom for a callable which accepts any combination of any number of named and keyword arguments:<p><pre><code>    def takes_any_arguments(*args, **kwargs):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nThese sorts of idioms are incredibly useful for dynamic programming; for example, I work with (and help develop) the Django web framework, and our object-relational mapper uses the `<i></i>kwargs` idiom to set up query methods which dynamically adapt the arguments they accept to the particular data model you're querying against.",1219473535
284509,comment,283639,284339,0,0,kaens,,,"A python ""lambda expression"" can effectively only be a one-liner - basically the return line of a function minus ""return"".<p>That is why people consider them castrated - in most languages I'm aware of that have a ""lambda"" statement, it can be read as ""create an anonymous function that executes this body of statements"". In python it reads as ""perform a simple transformation or calculation on or with these arguments"", as that's all it's generally good for.",1219473494

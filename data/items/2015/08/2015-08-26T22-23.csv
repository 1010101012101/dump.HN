They assemble those parts as needed to complete designs for themselves and for customers.<p>What people don&#x27;t understand is, Intel does the same. Look at how modern E3s, E5s, E7s, i3/5/7s, modern Atoms, etc, all work: similar designed parts, all paired with what is minimally required for that design to work and perform the way they want.<p>Intel doesn&#x27;t throw designs out, they keep them and periodically make sure they still work on smaller fab sizes and newer fab techs.<p>A more striking example than the Phi is the Intel Quark, featured in the Edison platform, which is Intel&#x27;s equivalent of an ARM Cortex-M series (such as the M4s used in a lot of cell phones as a GPS/motion sub-processor and other things). The Quark really <i>is</i> a modernized P54C (Pentium 1 pre-MMX) core, and more so than the Xeon Phi is (although, obviously, there is shared part design through both of them).<p>I think the thing with Phi is, its rapidly evolving. Larrabee was closer to this design than first gen Phi was, and now they&#x27;re shipping second gen Phi, and it looks more like how some GPUs have been historically designed than just x86 core spam (look at how the bus design is evolving, they&#x27;re getting closer and closer to how AMD and Nvidia design theirs, and also how post-Skylake on-die GPU integration is evolving on multi-socket platforms).<p>So, yeah. I don&#x27;t agree that the Phi can be flat out called a P54C, but I agree they have been reusing modernized parts from that era because it is easier to do that than continually strip down existing designs to look like that.<p>The Quark, however, looks a lot like how embedded family 286 and 486s have been kept alive for the embedded hardware sector, and now they&#x27;re positioning the Quark for the IoT era (which, hey, they have my interest with that product, so they did something right); the Quark is more of a P54C than the Phi is.",1440629537

What if they use Paypal or another payment provider? What do you use to prove source of consumption in that case?<p>Proof of supply well GL on that with how the internet works these days....<p>Say you are a small business that sells Ebooks in Chinese, you are a UK registered companies, the books you sell are serviced from a partner you have in China, you now need to be able to define where your customers are based, register for either the HMRC Union VAT MOSS(As far as i can tell the only country that actually built one) figure out what VAT rates need to be taxed when and adjusted it from your inclusive amounts, which means that your customers will still pay the same price but the VAT portion will vary from customer to customer based on their country.<p>This is the most simple scenario and it&#x27;s not that simple you have to be able to figure out the point of consumption (to a satisfactory level according to the new regulations which isn&#x27;t well defined) then update your software to deal with all those cases and to ensure that it will keep up with VAT and regulation changes, then you need to have to keep records for VAT returns for each state and file them separately for each state you have costumers in if you are a 1-2 man business this isn&#x27;t going to be easy, cheap, or even doable....<p>A 1 man business working with 20 EU members states now has to keep 20 VAT accounts and manage their books according to 20 different VAT regulations at this point even a good and expensive cart won&#x27;t help you that much since the book keeping alone can bring you under so you are left with either switching to a 3rd party market place losing upto 80% revenue, defining a narrow market say UK, France and Germany and geoblocking everyone else or if you are lucky and big enough pay a hefty sum to update your eCommerce platform and get a good accountant....<p>Oh and to top it up if you are a non-EU member company you have now to register in the EU to provide digital goods to EU member states, yep I&#x27;m sure all those small businesses from the developing world are really exited about that....<p>This was probably the most obscene tax mandate the EU has passed so far it does virtually nothing besides put people in a hard place heck they&#x27;ve even managed to some how ads into this since &quot;advertising space on a website&quot; is now digital goods apparently... 
Heck if you supply a bundle of a physical and a digital product now you have to charge VAT differently as digital goods and GL on estimating the amount you have to charge for them since before that it was a bundle this can include stuff like a technical journal with supplementary online content, a DVD with access to online streaming of content or a music CD with digital download.<p>So if i was an artist selling my music on CD&#x27;s and allowing people to also download my songs once they bought a CD well now I have to start charging separate VAT on both, and since the regulation states that i need to charge VAT at each &quot;delivery&quot; well what does it mean that every time you download my music I&#x27;m supposed to charge you VAT(And I&#x27;ve actually asked a couple of accountant friends and they don&#x27;t know either, I&#x27;ve also asked a couple of them what happens if I&#x27;m a German that is buying an Ebook with a German payment card while visiting the UK from a say Danish company where does the VAT goes? well round round and round it goes where does it should no body knows was pretty much the answer i got....)?<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg of insanity and the worse part since the regulation is so poorly defined now one actually can tell you with good enough certainty if you are complying with it or not.",1440629341

The problem has nothing to do with &quot;how can a machine guess the right answer&quot; but instead is all about &quot;how can a machine refine all the options based on the intentions expressed thus far&quot;.<p>Anecdotally, if we&#x27;d ask a real person &quot;where is a good place to eat&quot; the chance we&#x27;d go there without more information is slim. And if we don&#x27;t even trust people, trusting Siri will be a while.<p>What we&#x27;re really doing with these questions is making our hunger known, and starting a conversation. We actually don&#x27;t care that much about other people&#x27;s thoughts, and we may not even have anything in mind yet as far as where to eat. We do care about how people feel if they are someone we care about, but the thinking part we love to do ourselves.<p>So to offer a service that &quot;thinks&quot; is rather misguided, and may even constitute a disservice. We already rejected the talking paperclip in 1996 [0]. It&#x27;s failure wasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s intelligence, but in the value proposition itself.

10126455,comment,10125656,10126344,0,0,kentonv,,,"Yes, absolutely, that sounds like a perfect fit for Sandstorm&#x27;s security model. We are still working on some of the details, but the user will be able to ensure that the app can, say, talk to bankofamerica.com but not any other web site. You could also have each &quot;bank connector plugin&quot; be in a separate grain, so only that grain has outside access, and then a security-paranoid user only needs to review the connector code to make sure it doesn&#x27;t do anything nasty, rather than reviewing the whole app. The core app would only have permission to talk to the connectors.<p>Of course the next question is: will any user actually understand how to set this up? I think with the powerbox UI, it will actually be quite reasonable. It would look like this:<p>- User installs the base app, which initially has no permission to talk to the outside world.<p>- User clicks &quot;add an account&quot;, causing the app to make a powerbox request for an object implementing &quot;BankAccountConnector&quot;.<p>- The user doesn&#x27;t have any of those yet, so Sandstorm would guide the user through finding a matching app on the app market, installing it, and setting it up. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a reasonable UI here: You see a list of matches like &quot;Bank of America Connector&quot;, &quot;Wells Fargo Connector&quot;, etc.<p>- As part of installing an app, the user will be able to see who the author is, look at reviews, and (if they are so inclined) click through to code.<p>- Once installed, the connector app prompts for the user&#x27;s bank credentials and then makes a powerbox request for &quot;access to bankofamerica.com&quot; (or whatever). Sandstorm asks the user if the app may access this site, and the user confirms.<p>- Everything now resolves and the user is returned to the original app, which now is able to pull data from their bank account.<p>This is, of course, still very vaporware right now, but that&#x27;s the vision, and there honestly aren&#x27;t many open questions about how it will work, just code to write.",1440628926

If the Nuremberg trial of the leading Nazis should never have been undertaken, it does not follow that we should not have punished these men. It would have been consistent with our philosophy and our law to have disposed of such of the defendants as were in the ordinary sense murderers by individual, routine, undramatic, military trials. This was the course proposed in the speeches of the Archbishop of York, Viscount Cecil, Lord Wright, and others in the great debate of March 20, 1945, in the House of Lords. In such trials the evidence and the legal issues would have a stark simplicity and the lesson would be inescapable.

10126384,comment,10116086,10116086,0,0,wintry757,,,"I&#x27;ve recently done a survey of job listings, titles, and the skills and experience levels associated with the term “architect” for the North America corporate IT marketplace. I drew the general definition of an IT architect’s roles and responsibilities partly from major Enterprise Architecture frameworks (e.g., TOGAF, FEAF, and DODAF) and partly from the survey of architect job postings on popular employment websites (e.g., Monster, Dice).<p>This material is “enterprise”-y and may not describe some of the more advanced IT businesses out there, like Google or Facebook. But before I did the research and write-up, I was quite ignorant about some of the wider uses of the term, and I did not have much clarity on what separated an architect from (say) a project manager or product representative.<p>Seeing hundreds of job descriptions and trying to map out what companies and recruiters were looking for was quite eye-opening. These descriptions may contribute some useful knowledge or terminology to others in their career planning or job hunting. I would like to think they represent current IT best practices, organized, simplified, and given consistent terminology and definitions. But the title “architect” in IT is not yet usefully standardized, and there’s lots of room for alternative viewpoints.<p><i>IT architect roles, skills, and experience</i><p>The title of “architect” identifies someone with extensive experience in one or more IT knowledge and practice domains (as I define them below). The most junior architect role builds on at least ten years of progressive, non-management design and delivery experience in a basic IT domain. A more senior architect shows similar progressive experience but more of it, and in more than one IT domain.<p>Note: Title inflation may be weakening the concepts of seniority and specialization we used to associate with the IT architect role. Just as a startup with a few dozen employees may end up with numerous staff titled “Vice President”, some smaller IT environments give the title “architect” to several of the IT team without necessarily requiring lengthy experience or depth of knowledge. For example, in many job listings the title “Solution Architect” describes a (junior, three-year) technical sales-support role, not a senior IT architect role as it might be generally understood.<p><i>The IT domains</i><p>For our purposes, there are five core domains of enterprise IT practice and knowledge. Each domain has an equivalent architect role:<p><i>1. Business.</i> A business can be described as processes and groups of processes. Business architects analyze and document these processes and relationships to help optimize them for flexibility, efficiency, and performance.<p><i>2. Data.</i> The data architect deals with the stable, long-term structure of data of interest to the enterprise, and with the technologies that deliver value in data storage and retrieval.<p><i>3. Technology.</i> Applications and data reside on a complex and evolving technical infrastructure, which the technology architects design and implement.<p><i>4. Application.</i> Application architects are the senior representatives of the programming trade, experienced enough to support successful application design, development, integration, and delivery.<p><i>5. Security.</i> A newer entry to enterprise architecture, the security architect designs and oversees the implementation of corporate information security.<p><i>Apprenticeship roles</i><p>Every domain has one or more apprenticeship roles for individuals likely to become architects. For example:<p>1. Business: business analyst --> business architect
2. Data: database administrator  --> data analyst --> data architect
3. Technology: system admin --> infrastructure analyst --> technology architect
4. Application: software developer --> developer-analyst --> application architect
5. Security: network security analyst --> security architect<p>There are many more paths than these, and some of these may become uncommon or obsolete as the roles continue to evolve. Future architects often follow paths in two or more domains, for example, both the data and the application domains for n-tier client-server developers, or application and technology domains for web developers.<p><i>Senior architect roles</i><p>The most senior architects are not tied to specific IT domains. For their work to be valuable, they must have a strong knowledge of all IT domains, and extensive, progressive working experience in two or more domains. The most common titles for these roles are:<p><i>A. Solution Architect:</i> expert in two or more domains, and senior to single-domain architects<p><i>B. Enterprise Architect:</i> senior to all other IT architects in the enterprise<p>Note that the terminology for architects at this level of seniority is not very consistent at present in the industry. In particular, “solution architect” is a synonym for “application architect” in some markets. As well, the term “enterprise architect” is sometimes applied to any IT designer above a certain level of seniority, even if their experience has been in a single domain and they have no claim to senior-level knowledge or skills across the full collection of enterprise IT domains.<p><i>Nature of IT architecture practice</i><p>We don’t use “architecture” in the world of information technology as we do in the design and construction of buildings or other structures, where the term originated. In building physical structures, architecture is the initial step that elicits user (owner) requirements and attempts to meet them with one or more initial designs. A design will contain enough information to support project risk analysis, costing, and local zoning or equivalent review. When the design has been accepted, the architect is generally finished and other professions or trades come to the forefront of project decision-making.<p>IT systems and technology architecture works with extremely malleable but less predictable materials, processes, and staff roles. As a result, IT architects have far more freedom in design, but less certainty in the costs and risks of the resulting product.<p>As a result, the IT architect tends to be involved in a greater number of decisions for an IT project, may have made important decisions even before the project started (e.g., regarding corporate IT standards, development methodology, infrastructure technologies, etc.), and may influence IT development or delivery processes as well as detailed product and service design. The IT architect’s role is broader in scope and longer in duration than common for the architect role in construction.<p>In general, IT architects work with corporate business requirements and major project requirements as input, producing general enterprise IT standards and custom IT designs as output. Good architects are familiar with multiple means of achieving IT goals, including multiple basic computing platforms, multiple development methodologies, multiple product delivery architectures, IT design patterns, design and delivery tools, academic resources, and other contributors to flexible, intelligent decision-making and design.<p>Rather than producing architectural models and sketches to be implemented and then walking away to leave development and project handover to a subsequent team of engineers, IT architects define the overall IT delivery environment, do initial designs, select or define technical standards, and may even take lead engineer roles in one or phases of a delivery project. In short, the IT architect role overlaps with detailed systems engineering. This attention to both concept and detail helps overcome the problems of working with an insubstantial construction material like software, keeping the experienced designers in touch with a project and its technologies until all significant technical risks have been recognized and overcome.<p><i>Differences from other IT roles</i><p>The IT architect roles do not imply supervision or management responsibilities. Like the corporate lawyers or financial investment team, the architects are valued for their knowledge and resulting contributions to corporate goals. They typically do not take supervisory or management roles, as these do not require the specialized technical knowledge and skills for which the architects are retained.<p>Within IT departments, therefore, there exists a line of seniority for management that is separate from the line containing architects. Staff development for IT management generally follows a path from team lead on technical projects, to project management, to portfolio management (overseeing multiple projects, each with its own project manager) for a business unit or other organizational group.<p>IT managers generally keep up with the broad march of progress in the technology domains for which they are responsible, but do not remain active practitioners once they reach middle or senior management. IT architects, by contrast, remain active practitioners to develop and maintain the deep knowledge and skills associated with the title of “architect”.<p>I hope I haven&#x27;t muddied the water too much with these thoughts. I don&#x27;t claim any special insight here, and I think there is space (which is actively under exploration and colonization) for much deeper thought and more rigorous conclusions about the IT architect role, title, and qualifications. I&#x27;d be particularly interested to hear the current state of the art in Europe and Asia, if anyone has knowledge from these areas.",1440627758

This can be very rewarding to be part of a solution to an otherwise unserved or underserved customer.<p>You want to stretch your boundaries - titles in startups are rarely indicative of what you do, often you may participate in marketing, QA, development, business development, sales, project management, operations, and product management just by showing up that week.

You may want to work at a technology company but not sure of what role you want, a startup lets you try many roles. Further when you find one you like you can live it for a while and then move to a larger company in that same type of role.<p>Work with someone you respect - Sometimes you will find a startup where someone you know, either in person or through meetups or other social sites that you respect and feel you could learn from. If they are at a startup you may find it easier to get employed and work with them than you would if they were ensconced in some high office at a large company.<p>Challenging yourself - startups are usually fast paced, stressful, and often have a lot of unknowns flying around.

Being able to &quot;go with the flow&quot; on a project, change directions quickly, and see promising areas of development in the midst of crashing and burning are all things people often experience in startups.

An interesting case was Macks Creek. [0] That link claims that the new law &quot;limited&quot; traffic ticket revenue. It didn&#x27;t, actually, it just said that any revenue over the limit wouldn&#x27;t stay with the municipality, but would be transferred to the local public school district. That got rid of Macks Creek! I suspect that if that law were expanded from traffic tickets to encompass court fees as well, it would do quite a bit to discourage the municipal courts in Ferguson and neighboring towns from victimizing the public as they have. Sadly, I also suspect that racism will prevent this obvious fix from ever being implemented, even though poor whites throughout the state are victimized in similar ways.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m overstating my case.

face regarding qualified teachers, most school and district leaders have yet to make computer science a top priority.  Inequitable access to computer technology and computer  science learning opportunities prevents some students from building a computer science foundation needed for the future.<p>Even if the principals were perfectly aligned with the parents, and with the corporate interests of Google, it would have only a secondary or perhaps even tertiary effect on what goes on in schools.<p>Take away this pointless high-stakes testing, increase teacher funding, and provide more resources, and things may change. It will certainly change more than pointing out that there&#x27;s a difference of opinion between the principals and the parents.<p>[1] And now for a detail-oriented complaint.  The Google report says the BLS &quot;estimates that jobs in computer and mathematical occupations will increase by 18% in the 10 years leading up to 2022, creating more than 1.3 million job openings by 2022.&quot; This essay at vice.com says &quot;computer science related occupations will grow 18 percent by 2020&quot; and links to an entry for &#x27;computer programmers&#x27;. (The vice.com article has a typo by using &#x27;2020&#x27; instead of 2022&#x27;.)<p>But &quot;computer and mathematical occupations&quot; is different than &quot;computer science related&quot;, so these aren&#x27;t talking about the same occupations. Plus, if you follow the vice.com link to the BLS page at <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm#tab-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/c...</a> you&#x27;ll see that the BLS expects that the expected growth of &#x27;computer programmers&#x27; is actually <i>less</i> than &quot;total, all occupations.&quot;<p>The BLS estimates that the <i>broader area of</i> &#x27;Computer occupations&#x27; which will have the 18% growth. And looking at the breakdown by job category, they expect 20% growth in &quot;Computer user support specialists&quot; with 111K new jobs; 25% growth in &quot;Computer Systems Analysts&quot; with 127K new jobs; 37% growth in &quot;Information Security Analysts&quot; with 27K new jobs; and 22% growth in &quot;Software Developers&quot;, with 222,600 jobs.<p>(Note that &#x27;Although writing code is not their first priority, developers must have a strong background in computer programming&#x27;. Instead, software developers &#x27;Create a variety of models and diagrams (such as flowcharts) that instruct programmers how to write the software code&#x27;. Not my definition of a Software Developer. Nor Ballmer&#x27;s, I believe.)<p>The BLS also says that user support specialists often don&#x27;t need a CS degree, and that Computer Systems Analysts often come via a Business/MIS degree, so at least 10% of the growth in computer occupations is not due to a demand for people with specifically computer science training.<p>Anyway, I point this out because the essay title says &quot;Demand for Computer Science&quot; when the BLS numbers aren&#x27;t all about &#x27;Computer Science&#x27; but are more generically &quot;computer occupations&quot;, and include jobs which don&#x27;t require knowing how to program.",1440627329

After all, he had to know and even expect that security researchers would try to reconstruct his conversations after the fact. But this is far more difficult to do when the Twitter user in question never actually participates in threaded conversations. People who engage in this way of tweeting also do not readily reveal the Twitter identities of the people with whom they chat most.<p>I love how Krebs has reframed &quot;subtweeting&quot; as some sort of new security practice as opposed to an annoying passive-aggressive thing everyone does from time to time :-D",1440626971

I think the harm that&#x27;s being caused is not in the existence of a new service, but in the transition to a system where our resources are split: the notion that funding dedicated to general transportation is a zero-sum game and pushing resources towards a private solutions that helps only the wealthy takes away resources from the public, universal service -- hurting them.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting, also, that the public subsidizes services like Uber especially when it gets to the point where private cars are replacing busses and larger public transit: cars on the road generate risk of accidents and injury, pollute, generate wear and tear on the road and transportation system, generate traffic which harms everyone, etc. Having the poor subsidize a private service for the rich so they don&#x27;t have to ride alongside the riff-raff on a bus is pretty unpalatable.<p>We don&#x27;t have to take away resources from public universal solutions and transition them over the private, wealthy-only solutions. So far we haven&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s certainly possible that we won&#x27;t, and this private system will work concurrently alongside the public one in happy concert.

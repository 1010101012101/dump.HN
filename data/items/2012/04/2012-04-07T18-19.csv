So there's really no difference in marking a ""deleted"" flag or purging the data from the production servers: they are not (and should not, and arguably cannot be) able to the data from backups.<p>This is true for all web services.

Certainly it was the one I enjoyed the least (even slightly less than Fortran 90 which was somewhat of an achievement), and I think it wins my ""most hated language"" because of the intersection of awfulness and the nonzero chance that I'd have to program in it. While there are almost certainly worse languages - COBOL certainly appears to be one - there's effectively zero chance that I'll ever write anything in them, hence they're more of an amusing curiosity than something I can hate.

How do you handle email signatures? When someone comments on a task in BaseCamp (via email) the entire email is posted to the thread, including their signature and whatever little images they included (photograph, or Facebook/Twitter icons). Is there anything you can do about that? Gmail seems to be pretty good at detecting the boilerplate part of a message -- possibly only after having seen one message from the user. This would be an important thing to nail.<p>Edit: What if you want to lock a page down so that only you or a select few may email updates? I would probably want that for at least one of the pages. Now that I'm thinking about it, the lack of registration is possibly due to how hard it would be to authenticate a user via easily-spoofed email. You might be able to come up with a sort of ""secret key"" that you add anywhere in the email but I could see that not working out for your average user.",1333824732

3811738,comment,3809829,3810642,1,0,TorKlingberg,,,"Messaging is most useful when you want to communicate between separate servers (or at least processes) and you control both sides. Within a process it is usually overkill. On a public interface with independent implementations you probably want a protocol that can be implemented in any language rather than be tied to a specific messaging library. Between separate parts of one system, messaging can be a convenient and efficient way to send around information. This used to be most common in large complex systems (""enterprise""), but with distributed scaling it is getting more useful for startups and hobbyists.<p>An alternative in the same space is remote procedure call (RPC). RPC is synchronous while messaging is asynchronous.",1333824715
3811737,comment,3808238,3808782,1,0,orijing,,,"Imagine it this way. Your friends are data, you have limited capacity, and you access them with some pattern. Suppose you live in a world without Facebook.<p>Your wife and kids are in your registers. You see them all the time, and generally they're either a room away or (at the most) a phone call away.<p>Your best friends are in your L1 cache. Sometimes they come up to the registers after you've been hanging out with them for a while, but even if not, they're only a phone call or text away in the L1 cache.<p>...<p>Your friend from elementary school you haven't talked to for years is on disk swap. He lives in Japan, and you might want to contact him if you're traveling there.<p>In that world, it's still very cheap to access your most frequently-accessed connections--your wife, kids, best friends. However, as you go down the memory hierarchy it becomes very expensive to access them. And so, you contact them less often.<p>Enter Facebook. Now your friend from Japan is only a post away. You don't have time to have email threads with all of your friends, down to that friend from elementary school. But you can occasionally keep up with that friend by browsing to his timeline, occasionally seeing some major events ""X got engaged"", and maybe sending a light message. Suddenly your disk became an SSD and it became much cheaper to keep in contact.<p>Your registers and L1 caches haven't changed much. Now you can contact them in the medium that's most convenient at the time. You can message them from your phone (fb messenger), or skype them on your computer, but you can also just call them or talk to them. Facebook gives you more options for accessing the most-accessed friends. As a result, it both expands the size of your caches and main memory, but also makes each level faster to access so you can keep in touch with more of them.<p>So I don't think the right approach is to think of friends in a binary fashion: Worth keeping in touch with, and not worth keeping in touch with.<p>Instead, it's a gradient, and communication platforms like Facebook just improve the gradient so it's worthwhile (i.e. possible and easy) to keep in touch with a lot more of your friends.",1333824709

Software in the days you speak of WAS more like free software today. Hackers did share software and patches and such. If you had a problem with a piece of Unix code, whoever the commercial vendor was would often just send you the source. If it stayed like this, there would never be a need for the FSF.<p>#3. Developers can work on whatever they want in their spare time. If a developer feels that it's valuable to donate his or her labor to improve a piece of software that can improve everyone's lives then that's their business. They have the FREEDOM to do what they want with their time and intellectual capacity and if that's in creating software that supports user freedom, then obviously they see a benefit in it.<p>#4. It's shortsighted and wrong to say that free software is anti-commercial. Red Hat is a billion dollar company now. Microsoft was one of the largest contributors of code to the Linux kernel last year.

3811685,comment,3811563,3811661,4,0,Alex3917,,,"The link you are pointing to is a blog post, not a study.<p>Also, if you read the underlying studies you'll see that the ones where they give drivers marijuana under controlled conditions usually don't result in any increased risk at all, whereas with alcohol it's very easy to see a huge increase in risk using the exact same methodology). The second kind of studies they generally use are observational studies, which tend to peg the underlying risk increase from marijuana at around 2x (as compared with alcohol, which gives on average a 3x increase at the legal limit). However, the authors of these observational studies themselves say that this is most likely actually an overestimate of the risk, not an underestimate. Here are the caveats from one recent metastudy:<p>""Although this meta-analysis provides compelling evidence for an association between marijuana use and crash risk, it is impossible to infer causality from these epidemiologic data alone. A more rigorous assessment of the nature of the relation between marijuana use and crash risk is complicated by several factors. Among them are bias from measured and unmeasured confounding and the difficulty posed by polydrug use. Although most of the studies included in this meta-analysis considered some confounding variables in evaluating the association between marijuana use and crash risk, adjustment was usually limited to a few measured covariates, such as age, sex, and alcohol use. Additional variables that may confound the relation between marijuana use and crash risk, such as exposure to driving and risk-taking propensity, are often difficult to mea- sure and thus are not readily available. Other factors confounding the relation between marijuana use and crash risk are divergent definitions and assessments of marijuana use across studies.<p>Different methods of assessing marijuana use (e.g., self- report, urine tests, and blood tests) may have different levels of validity and reliability (39). Most of these screenings determine whether marijuana was used within the past few weeks, whereas acute impairment in driving skills from marijuana use lasts only 34 hours (39). <i>Furthermore, because marijuana is an illicit drug in most countries, it is possible that drivers in the comparison groups might be less likely than those involved in crashes to submit to testing, which could lead to overestimation of the effect of marijuana use on crash risk (43).</i><p>Polydrug use represents another challenge to determining the role of marijuana in motor vehicle crashes. Polydrug use by drivers is common, with up to a quarter of drivers injured in crashes testing positive for 2 or more drugs (including alcohol) (42, 73, 74). Although it is necessary to understand the effect of individual drugs on driving performance, the high prevalence of polydrug use by drivers makes it difficult to do so. On the other hand, assessing interaction effects on driving safety of different drug combinations based on epidemiologic data would require very large study samples, comprehensive drug testing data, and tremendous financial and other resources (4244, 75, 76). One of the studies included in the meta-analysis evaluated the effect of marijuana in combination with alcohol on crash risk and found that the combination of marijuana and alcohol confers an exceptionally heightened risk to driving safety (68). Experimental studies show that cannabis and alcohol affect different cognitive functions that may interact with driving performance (41). Specifically, cannabis seems to impair automatic behaviors, such as tracking, at low doses and impair ability to perform more complex tasks at higher doses, whereas alcohol seems to more readily affect functions requiring cognitive control (41). While both marijuana and alcohol can impair driving performance, there appears to be greater variations in effects of marijuana compared with alcohol (41).""<p>source: Marijuana Use and Motor Vehicle Crashes<p>Mu-Chen Li, Joanne E.

There is, of course, no such thing.  There's subsidized software, but no free software exists.<p>Linux, as an example, is probably the most expensive piece of software ever developed.  Think of all the people employed at universities and businesses who devoted time paid by their employer to develop Linux.  Even if they did the work at home ""on their own time"".  The only reason this was even remotely possible is because they had gainful employment that kept a roof over their heads and paid the bills. The same is true of students who contributed to Linux.  Their parents, or the government (through a loan) provided the financial support to work on Linux.<p>Not one of these people would have been able to work on Linux had their financial needs, need for shelter and generally ""having a life"" needs had not been met through either employment, parental support, loans or grants.<p>Free software is, at best, subsidized, and at worst, not free at all.  I'll be that Linux probably cost more to develop than Windows or OSX.<p>Now, there's free to the end user.  OK.  That's fine.  People will take free food, free beer, free ice-cream and free software.  That's human nature.<p>I don't find reveling against commercial software a particularly intelligent stance.  No offense intended.  Those writing software for sale are simply choosing to earn a living writing software that they sell rather than doing something else to subsidize software to be given away.<p>If I am good at writing software, why should I be a gardener to pay for food and shelter and give away software?<p>Furthermore, all of the software that RMS used as the model for GNU was the result of years of expensive development and none of it was free.  It's a lot easier to, say, study and learn Unix and then go off and develop a ""free"" Unix clone than to have to invest years upon years developing and optimizing Unix in the first place.<p>One of my favorite saying goes something like this:  The second person who saw the wheel thought it was obvious.<p>I don't find waging war against non-free software a particularly honorable stance when you are standing on the shoulders of giants who devoted years and billions of dollars to evolve an industry and, yes, make money with it.<p>I wonder if he refuses medical attention when he goes to the hospital because the software on all of the systems at the hospital do not use free software.

Imagine if I comb through legal archives and present case summaries to help you understand a legal concept. That is an extraordinary task, much MORE difficult than summarizing a case. The same can be said in producing educational material for a neuroscience or psychology class. I am teacher and I believe that publishers are producing complex ""information"" beyond the word order (ie. content order, curriculum) that should be copyrightable.<p>If you disagree, run this issue through the GUCCI KNOCKOFF TEST: would this product have even close to the same value or marketability if it weren't for its close resemblance to the original?<p>If they were to use the same material (in this case reworked Wikipedia articles for the most part) but not use existing layouts/curriculum would it have the same value to university students?<p>In my view, their production costs would rise substantially because they would need to hire curriculum experts and their get to market strategy would disappear as they lost their value to university students.<p>I'm frankly surprised that their investors bought the ""alignment"" argument.",1333822588

I had three research positions, I TA'd, I worked as a tutor through the university, and I was completing an honors thesis in Neuroscience. I was obsessed with getting into a top PhD program, due to feelings of personal inadequacy. There was one semester in particular where I overloaded to 23 credits (12 being full-time) in order to graduate on time. I withdrew from friendships - some people thought that I'd transferred or graduated. I routinely worked 16 hour days, including weekends in the lab, and started having health problems that I didn't have time to properly address. Eventually, the quality of my work badly deteriorated. I somehow defended my thesis, and got interviews from several top-50 PhD programs. After flying out and visiting one program for a weekend, I realized that I needed a break from academia, at the very least.<p>I withdrew from my obligations at university (I had plenty of credits to graduate), and moved to San Francisco. I feel so much more like my old self after a month of programming for fun with friends - my creativity and excitement are back.<p>My advice: be aware of how you feel about your work. You can only loathe it for so long before it begins to take a toll on you. You're a human, not a machine, and you need to take care of yourself. Exercise regularly and spend time socializing with friends and meeting new people :)",1333822418

However, I think that there isn't really a ""happy medium"" in terms of whether direct access to the file system is provided or not, there is either access or there isn't. Rather, one possible solution is to put the onus on the app developer and allow apps to present files that can be ""public"" within the phone and accessible to other applications. Obviously this opens a worms in terms of security, which I think is one of the main reasons that Apple has not done this.",1338929957

I had a fairly large collection of MP3s at the time -- maybe a coupla thousand -- and a bunch of versions of the same song in some cases (an album version, a radio version, live at here, live at there), and it was all neatly categorized in the filesystem, band/album/name, when I switched from Gentoo to OS X.  I freely admit I should have had a backup.<p>When I ""tried"" iTunes, there was an option for it to rename all your files (I don't remember whether it was the default or if I stumbled on it), but what I did NOT expect was that  all my carefully named folders and files would be lumped into ""Unknown Artist""/""Unknown Album""/""Unknown Track NNN"".mp3, while my old files were all carefully removed.<p>My MP3 collection literally never recovered.  I could choose to play the few hundred tracks that had happened to have good ID3 information, but all the tracks I'd ripped myself were essentially randomized.  I also never found an ID3 creator that could successfully differentiate the various versions of songs I had, though I stopped trying around 2006 or 2007, and now I don't bother buying music any more -- I just listen to Pandora.",1338929876

I would  certainly like to try out such a service (I really liked chatroulette at the time it was big), however I don't have anything to show off. the thing with those video chats is that they need a certain amount of anonymity otherwise those meetings might turn awkward. being quickly introduced to numerous people at a party can be strenuous, doing the same to up to 20 people might get you exhausted pretty quickly, if you always try to be at your best in terms of behaviour. chatroulette had this veil of anonymity because every jerk could join and you knew anything that happened there wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. airtime tries to take this to the next level, but I don't think I'll be up for it.",1338929823

4070696,comment,4068594,4068594,9,0,d3throwaway,,,"As both a scientist and avid Diablo 2 player, this blog post is laughable in its superficiality and its claims.<p>TL;DR: Diablo 3 was WoWified: broke itemization and skill builds, and thus replayability.<p>In D3, finding a rare item is ""ID, does it have those stats? Yes: keep, No: salvage"".  Brainless.<p>In D2, finding a rare item is ""ID, weird combination of stats, but I don't think anyone wants this so I'll throw it away, go to d2jsp and find some absurdly rich player wanting that ridiculous combination and kicking yourself for vendoring it"".<p>--<p>Background: thousands of hours manually farming and botting Diablo 2 since vanilla release, equivalent time spent trading/on d2jsp (most of this will refer to 1.09 since that is most fresh in my mind).  Also lvl 60 demon hunter in Diablo 3 Inferno Act 3.<p>Please don't argue that D2 was just as broken on release.  The D3 team had YEARS of experience to look back on.<p>--<p>1) D2 was all about plowing through monsters.  If you were underleveled or undergeared, bosses should be somewhat difficult.  If you were reasonably prepared, bosses should be fairly easy.  If you even had decent gear, bosses should be a joke.<p>D3, on the other hand, treats everything like a WoW raid.  Hours of grinding to prepare for a fight, min-maxing forcing everyone into a single class or build (energy armor wizard or PMS demon hunter?), and even then, the fights are difficult( vs champions/elites).<p>Why is this important?  Because D2 was so ""easy"", many many skill builds were viable.  Wanted to roll a melee sorc? Go ahead.  Fishymancer ( = pet wd in d3)? Works.  Throwing barb?  Surprisingly strong.  Thorns + fire aura pally? Too good.<p>The proliferation of crazy builds is important, as it makes a MUCH larger proportion of items valuable.  This will tie in with the next point.<p>--<p>2) D3 itemization is broken.  First, there are very, very few item stats that are important.  Weapon DPS, main stat, vitality, resist all.  Maybe atk speed, crit, crit dmg, move speed.  Everything else is garbage.  Health globe radius, seriously?<p>What made many D2 builds viable was the much larger variety of item effects, as well as lack of dependence on stats.  Life tap wands made smiters useful, enigma was good for everyone, infinity runeward allowed lightning sorcs and javazons to fight lightning immune, etc.<p>--<p>3) Rare items. The above 2 problems, when taken together, kill the D3 end-game.  D2 was all about making a MF build, getting some money, then making a bunch of crazy characters, either min-maxing MF or PVP or Baal runs or something, but there was a ton of variety in what you could do.  End game economy revolved around rare items.<p>In D3, finding a rare item is ""ID, does it have those stats? Yes: keep, No: salvage"".  Brainless.<p>In D2, finding a rare item is ""ID, weird combination of stats, but I don't think anyone wants this so I'll throw it away, go to d2jsp and find some absurdly rich player wanting that ridiculous combination and kicking yourself for vendoring it"".  This means that botting was difficult, because the really big $$ items are ones you wouldn't even recognize, and stash size was a limitation.<p>--<p>Anyways, that's why I stopped playing D3.  I really don't think they can fix these problems without very large patches, which seems unlikely coming from actiblizzard.",1338928483

4070554,comment,4070257,4070257,81,0,citricsquid,,,"I've tried writing this comment multiple times and I'm struggling to find a way to explain it well. We sold our company[1] and part of the sale terms were we would be retained as the ""managers"" of the products (websites) and I always approached the sale as: ""We take their money, they use their experience and assets to increase the value of the products and we continue to manage the product"" and in theory that's what happened, unfortunately I made one big mistake: I didn't at any point realise how much control (freedom) mattered.<p>The company that acquired us is fine and I have no problems with them in any way and I enjoy my job, but it's just so different to how it was before. I guess a good real world comparison is renting vs. owning, if you own your home you can paint the walls, install a new floor or turn an entire wall into a television. When you're renting you're limited to very insignificant and inconsequential things, you can move around your sofas, have red plates instead of blue and get a new desk, but what sort of control is that? It's all cosmetic.<p>If I ever sell a company again I will absolutely make sure that the sale is the end of my involvement. If I wake up in the morning and have control I can think ""today I'm going to make my company so fucking awesome, yeah!"" because the sky is the limit, but as an employee it's just ""oh, today I'm going to work... my goals are x and I can't change that"" and when the former was previously possible and is no longer an option it's very depressing. I guess depressing is a dramatic word, but that's how it feels. Maybe stifling would be better, or trapped.<p>[1] I say company but the company was just for the sake of legalities, we didn't have an office or any formal structure, we just ran a couple of websites.<p>(I've been thinking about this for a while now and this blog post reminded me how I felt, sorry if the comment is too off-topic)",1338926873

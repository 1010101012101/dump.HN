In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress.""",1211016958
192551,comment,191907,192173,0,0,trekker7,,,"Yeah but even biological computers have to observe the physical laws of nature right? The hardware of my brain is basically a parallel computer with electricity flowing through it. Maybe hardware should be influenced by physics, and software (neural networks, machine learning, etc.) by biology/cognitive science.",1211016746

I don't see this as tainting or complicating the pure, theoretical aspects of Computer Science with messy implementation details that are going to change in 2 years anyway (presumably, hard realities observed through Physics will stick around for a long, long time, until/unless we discover them to be different). Rather, I see this as another place where we can use Nature as a design guide.",1211016234

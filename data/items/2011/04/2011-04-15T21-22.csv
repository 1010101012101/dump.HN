As part of it I sniffed a bunch of people's passwords in coffee shops, as well as other black hatty things that I'm not proud of (though I will say that I learned tremendously from them). While these pattern based passwords work nicely to deter automated systems from grabbing your password after a site compromises your password, they dont stand to the test of human eyes. I had several people's passwords who used similar tactics, it wasn't hard to figure out the pattern. My point here is this: don't rile yourself up about having bulletproof passwords. It's good that you do it, but don't mandate it if you're the head of a company. No password is bulletproof - if someone wants it hard enough, they will get it. Figuring out a pattern based password is only another breadcrumb to follow.",1302904514

Additionally there is little recourse if an instructor has it in for you.<p>When I was 14, I had an ""International trade"" simulation in which each student was a ""country"" trying to make hamburgers. Each country was given a large amount of 2-3 ingredients, but 6 were necessary to make a burger (lettuce, cheese, patty, bread, tomato, mayo). So we had to trade and we'd be graded on how many burgers we could complete. The teacher was left wing and was trying to teach a ""fixed wealth"" version of trade. Some countries were specifically given less resources. Sparking cries of ""unfair!"". I was given less than average, and wasn't content to lose. So I immediately traded everything I had 2:1 to buy up all the patties; cornering the closed market trivially. Once I could roadblock a majority of the market, I asked for a 1:10 rate in return. I got by far the most complete hamburgers, but received an F for the exercise.<p>The teacher had hoped that we'd learn that wealth is pre-determined and trade more favorably with countries that had less. I wasn't participating in the ""spirit"" of the exercise. Thankfully she stopped short of calling it cheating.",1302903885

Anyone who's even glanced at password complexity research will be able to tell you that. To break down the numbers though, a 10 character password using lowercase letters and symbols (spaces) has 30155888444737843000 possible combinations. A six character password has 735091890625 combinations (around 1/4000th of the complexity, assuming a brute force approach). While the author also takes into account the possibilities of using a dictionary attack, you can't really tie a number to the search space for that. It depends on the breadth of what the program will go to. Will it check alternate spellings (color/colour)? Will it check for apostrophes? Foreign languages?

It is hardly a secret that MMORPG items and characters are often bought and sold using real world currency.

In theory players could easily use games such as these for money laundering and tax evasion. I don't think the government will shut down MMORPGs, but I believe that government interference and regulation of game economies is inevitable as they grow.<p>As for Bitcoin, you can research the legal history of various ""digital currencies"" and you will see that there have already been problems in this area. The purpose of Bitcoin, a decentralized and unregulated anonymous medium of exchange is obviously contradictory to the government's aims.

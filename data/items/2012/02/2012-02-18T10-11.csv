Its a step and the OP is slapping the author for celebrating the fact that science fiction THIS RICH is dedicated to A GAME. Not in the form of written text (Planescape / Kotor / Monkey Island) not static responses, not static characters. This fiction is highly integrated to a competent game system with high production values. Its not perfect but its an accomplishment nonetheless. I havent seen any games that have a custom universe this fleshed out and well planned.",1329562215

I'm sure there are tons of developers that can sort arrays like there is no tomorrow, but sometimes I would like to work with people that can create software. People that write tests, are able to set up a sane build process, keep the clutter to a minimum and make nice APIs.<p>What I'm looking for in coders is passion. Ask people for their personal projects and let them talk about it! Ask for a Github account upfront and look at weather they commit fixes to other projects and show initiative, look at their personal toy projects, look at weather or not they're able to work with complete strangers and improve software just because they like doing it.<p>Some people might not have a Github account.

All too often when you choose the reuse path, you end up going around in circles with stuff that may be good, but it doesn't fit your problem very well.<p>Also, humans are builders. It's what we do.<p>If you look at this problem closely, like I have over the past 15 years or so, you can already see evolution and natural selection happening. So I don't really see diversity as a big problem, and I do expect that in a generation or two, there will be a lot more consensus around which tools to use. However, even then, I do expect to see a fair amount of diversity.<p>Even today, where Google dominates search, they are dwarfed by Baidu in China. And in Russia, many people prefer Rambler. Orkut is a big social network in Brasil, Vkontakte in Russia, etc. Programming tools and libraries are the same, i.e. a lot of the choices are made for cultural reasons and that will never go away so some diversity will always be here.<p>Hopefully more people can gain the perspective that many years of experience bring, and can contribute to the process of natural selection (which implies improvement too) in order to get more people choosing and using better tools.",1329561344

3606355,comment,3604680,3604985,2,0,drostie,,,"Well, they might have used the idea, but it's not really something easily tractable even for them.<p>I have to admit, I'm reading Rivest's source code and I don't completely grok the encryption scheme yet, but it seems to me that it works like this. Here's the problem: you've got this very pretty conjecture which says ""give me just 26 cards, there are about 2^88 permutations of them, and choosing one at random produces a much larger set of possibilities than we could guess in the forseeable future with brute-force techniques."" He then provide a cipher which takes a shuffled deck and 26 spots in memory, and uses the red half and the black half to provide a random pathway for the bits through this network, since at each step there is an incoming bit which tells which way you shuffle. (And I gather that also some of the cards may basically be flipped upside down when storing the key, which means ""flip the bit as you transmit it."")<p>It's perfectly valid as an observation, and a nice conjecture, although I'm a little bit concerned in many ways about the design, since it still seems like it only has 2^26 state leaked pretty straightforwardly one bit at a time from two different locations. But maybe he's correct.<p>Still there's something technologically missing. This is a very simple algorithm for modern computers with their array lookups, and I suppose the military had all the budget they needed to build large machines which can actually push around these bits, but that sort of mixing network would have been really difficult to implement mechanically. In a world where computers were too expensive to distribute to every ship's captain, I could see the NSA being much less interested in this sort of physically pushing bits around a complicated network via pathways that won't be known until run-time.",1329560642

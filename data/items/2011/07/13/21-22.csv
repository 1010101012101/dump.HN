There may just be a mismatch between the worth of the shares between different parties.<p>If I bought a house with a friend 10 years ago for $100k, we did some work on it, and it's now worth $200k, my friend may no longer wish to live with me or may want to move on to a different area and sell his share for twice what he paid for it.

She may be more impressed if startup pitches read like research papers and less like, well, startups.<p>However, there are a number of problems with conflating research problems with startup opportunities, one of the first being that the startup field is now a lot smaller than it was.<p>She talks about Stanford and Harvard students as though they're the best of the best and while it's true that  recent graduates may have great potential, what you really want for research-level efforts is domain experts. It usually takes years to become a domain export -- far longer than the typical beginning-phase startup.<p>There are also a number of major problems with funding straight research efforts just from an expected-value point of view. Even Google was mostly working with known quantities (i.e., the exploratory research had already been done) when it started. If the result of a year-long startup effort is ""turns out this is impossible"" that's pretty bad.<p>Basically, there's a sweet spot for startups in a fiscal and informational sense and I think it will always tend to sound a little less impressive given that context.",1310594368

I've hit a TB down in a single month, and have never heard a word from Comcast about it.<p>Do they turn a blind eye because I'm on a more expensive plan, or is it because of lack of network congestion in the Mission, or maybe due to the availability of alternative internet service providers?",1310594217

Investors can then make a return through either dividends over time or by selling their shares to other investors who place a higher value on the company.

You sound like you're at least somewhat familiar with peering agreements, so I'd like to know how that part works.  If your customers are mostly receiving instead of sending, wouldn't those bits be paid for by the ones sending the bits?<p>For that matter, why can I get 200GB/mo at 50mbit/s <i>plus</i> a server for $20 from a VPS provider, and $.15/GB beyond that ($.10 if purchased in advance in the case of Linode)?  Why do consumer ISPs need to charge so much more?<p>Based on your arguments in this and other posts, they have caps because they have to pay for the outgoing bandwidth.  Why not just charge $.15/GB over the cap?  Last mile infrastructure doesn't account for the difference, since it has a mostly fixed cost of construction and operation.

Based on the number of sessions at Google IO this year for GWT (many) and the number of sessions for Closure (one?), I would say they were outwardly pushing GWT much more than Closure.<p>I wish they would come out with more JavaScript tools. I have used GWT for a couple side projects, and while the tools and library are amazing, writing an app the ""GWT Way"" (using all the design patterns) is cumbersome and difficult, especially for a one-man-show.<p>Closure is better in this regard (mostly by virtue of being a JavaScript library instead of a Java library, IMO), but it's still overkill for quick side projects where something like underscore.js would suffice.<p>Why would they use Closure instead of GWT? Closure is just JavaScript. No waiting for the GWT team to build the features you need, no having to build those features yourself. And in my experience, when I need cutting edge with GWT, I end up writing a bunch of wrappers for JavaScript functions, which makes me wonder why I'm not writing everything in JavaScript. (Like I said, the GWT library is very compelling and when planning a large project, Java often feels more comfortable for some.)<p>So no, I doubt they are killing GWT, but it would sure be nice to see them develop some comparable JavaScript tooling (as one of their main points for choosing Java as the language of GWT is because of the quality of the existing Java tools).",1310593656

The main use in my mind would be as PR tools, either sending promotional badges to journalists etc or as novelty items containing already released music to be sold at events.

Given that track skipping isn't possible on a Play Button, you wouldn't have to slice the recording into tracks before release.

2760663,comment,2760233,2760461,6,0,tokenadult,,,"Just for friendly advice to the Khan Academy exercise developers, I'll repost my FAQ about the distinction between ""exercises"" and ""problems"" in mathematics education. It would be great to see more problems on the Khan Academy site.<p>FAQ begins here:<p>PROBLEMS VERSUS EXERCISES<p>I frequently encounter discussions among parents about repetitive school math lessons, so a few years ago I prepared this Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) document about the distinction between math exercises (good in sufficient but not excessive amount) and math problems (always good in any amount).<p>Most books about mathematics have what are called ""exercises"" in them, questions that prompt a learner to practice the concepts discussed in the mathematics book. By reading one mathematics book, and then several more, I learned that some mathematicians draw a distinction between ""exercises"" and ""problems"" (which is the terminology generally used by the mathematicians who draw this distinction). I think this distinction is useful for teachers and learners to consider while selecting materials for studying mathematics, so I'll share the quotations from which I learned this distinction here. I first read about the distinction between exercises and problems in a Taiwan reprint of a book by Howard Eves.<p>""It is perhaps pertinent to make a comment or two here about the problems of the text. There is a distinction between what may be called a PROBLEM and what may be considered an EXERCISE. The latter serves to drill a student in some technique or procedure, and requires little, if any, original thought. Thus, after a student beginning algebra has encountered the quadratic formula, he should undoubtedly be given a set of exercises in the form of specific quadratic equations to be solved by the newly acquired tool. The working of these exercises will help clinch his grasp of the formula and will assure his ability to use the formula. An exercise, then, can always be done with reasonable dispatch and with a minimum of creative thinking. In contrast to an exercise, a problem, if it is a good one for its level, should require thought on the part of the student. The student must devise strategic attacks, some of which may fail, others of which may partially or completely carry him through. He may need to look up some procedure or some associated material in texts, so that he can push his plan through. Having successfully solved a problem, the student should consider it to see if he can devise a different and perhaps better solution. He should look for further deductions, generalizations, applications, and allied results. In short, he should live with the thing for a time, and examine it carefully in all lights. To be suitable, a problem must be such that the student cannot solve it immediately. One does not complain about a problem being too difficult, but rather too easy.<p>""It is impossible to overstate the importance of problems in mathematics. It is by means of problems that mathematics develops and actually lifts itself by its own bootstraps. Every research article, every doctoral thesis, every new discovery in mathematics, results from an attempt to solve some problem. The posing of appropriate problems, then, appears to be a very suitable way to introduce the student to mathematical research. And it is worth noting, the more problems one plays with, the more problems one may be able to pose on one's own. The ability to propose significant problems is one requirement to be a creative mathematician.""<p>Eves, Howard (1963). A Survey of Geometry volume 1. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, page ix.<p>I have since read about this distinction in several other books.<p>""Before going any further, let's digress a minute to discuss different levels of problems that might appear in a book about mathematics:<p>Level 1.

Boston: Addison-Wesley, pages 72-73.<p>This digression becomes the subject of a, um, problem in Exercise 4 of Chapter 3: ""The text describes problems at levels 1 through 5. What is a level 0 problem? (This, by the way, is NOT a level 0 problem.)""<p>""First, what is a PROBLEM? We distinguish between PROBLEMS and EXERCISES. An exercise is a question that you know how to resolve immediately. Whether you get it right or not depends on how expertly you apply specific techniques, but you don't need to puzzle out what techniques to use. In contrast, a problem demands much thought and resourcefulness before the right approach is found. . . .<p>""A good problem is mysterious and interesting. It is mysterious, because at first you don't know how to solve it. If it is not interesting, you won't think about it much. If it is interesting, though, you will want to put a lot of time and effort into understanding it.""<p>Zeitz, Paul (1999). The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. New York: Wiley, pages 3 and 4.<p>"". . . . As Paul Halmos said, 'Problems are the heart of mathematics,' so we should 'emphasize them more and more in the classroom, in seminars, and in the books and articles we write, to train our students to be better problem-posers and problem-solvers than we are.'<p>""The problems we have selected are definitely not exercises. Our definition of an exercise is that you look at it and know immediately how to complete it. It is just a question of doing the work, whereas by a problem, we mean a more intricate question for which at first one has probably no clue to how to approach it, but by perseverance and inspired effort one can transform it into a sequence of exercises.""<p>Andreescu, Titu & Gelca, Razvan (2000), Mathematical Olympiad Challenges. Boston: Birkhuser, page xiii.<p>""It is easier to advance in one topic by going ahead with the more elementary parts of another topic, where the first one is applied. The brain much prefers to work that way, rather than to concentrate on ugly technical formulas which are obviously unrelated to anything except artificial drilling. Of course, some rote drilling is necessary. The problem is how to strike a balance.""<p>Lang, Serge (1988), Basic Mathematics. New York: Springer-Verlag, p. xi.<p>""Learn by Solving Problems<p>""We believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by solving problems. Lots and lots of problems. In fact, we believe the best way to learn mathematics is to try to solve problems that you don't know how to do. When you discover something on your own, you'll understand it much better than if someone just tells it to you.<p>. . . .<p>""If you find the problems are too easy, this means you should try harder problems.

I've stumbled across a handy mental model (in which empathy plays a pivotal role) through research on mindfulness, emotion, and neuroscience, as well as in an emotional intelligence course taught at Google by Chade-Meng Tan. In short:<p>Bodily awareness -> emotional self-awareness -> emotional other-awareness (empathy) -> effective communication -> healthy relationships -> happiness.<p>It turns out that your brain uses the same machinery to model your own emotional state as that which it uses to model the emotional states of others, so the better you are at identifying your own emotional states, the better you will be at identifying them in others, which will allow you to communicate more effectively and so forth.<p>Also relevant: Asana's Jack Stahl touches on the importance of empathy in a post post about peer feedback at work: <a href=""http://asana.com/2011/06/peer-feedback-at-asana/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asana.com/2011/06/peer-feedback-at-asana/</a>",1310590839

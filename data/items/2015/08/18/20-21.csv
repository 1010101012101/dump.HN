I&#x27;ve worked in the commercial networking hardware industry for some years and shelved several consumer ideas due to a lack of interest in security/privacy.<p>I have watched over many years as this &#x27;cloud&#x27; software bonanza has eclipsed the tech industry. It went away from its original intent a long time ago and now is used as the holy-grail method of :<p>> ensuring (rent) is always paid for service(s) people should OWN<p>> vacuuming up and selling people&#x27;s data.<p>I have several projects on my plate. However, I have a solid one for securing people&#x27;s data when it comes to the IoT movement (in hardware)... It revolves around the same hardware/technology that the industry uses to scrape and funnel your data except the home user will now have it at their disposal as well.<p>Users should have 100% control of their data. If someone wants to &#x27;monetize&#x27; it or use it to &#x27;improve&#x27; their platform, the user should be rightfully paid for the opportunity to do so.<p>Disruption? Yeah, I think it&#x27;s time. The foolishness has gotten far too long in the tooth.<p>.. And the backwards thing about it is: there are simple and straight forward ways to secure data (in hardware). It&#x27;s only because everyone in the industry wants to ship your data all over the place and data-mine the snot out of it that things are as insecure as they are.<p>The very (loop-hole) or (door) that is used to funnel/mine/monetize/cloudify data is the very one used as an attack vector. Complicating the crap out of things at that point defeats the whole purpose.... Get rid of the door all together and the home is the least of all places where you should be exposing yourself.",1439931578

Or to try another metaphor, it&#x27;s the equivalent of dumping data on flat free-text files instead of a relational database.<p>Web chat does away with two (at least) properties I have come to appreciate in written communication: being asynchronous and contextual. Although modern web chat systems typically work even when you&#x27;re offline by sending notifications, they&#x27;re primarily a realtime system. There is the implicit or explicit expectation that a chat message (especially a direct one) should be answered asap, unlike an email or a tracker comment. As for context, there is little to none. In more than one company I&#x27;ve seen chat effectively replace the dedicated bug/ticket tracker system, with people polluting one or more channels with intermixed discussions that would be better off as comments on the ticket at hand. It&#x27;s a mess for anything other than transient, throwaway stuff you wouldn&#x27;t mind purging after a few hours or days.<p>Looking forward for a &quot;web chat considered harmful&quot; blog post if there hasn&#x27;t been one already. </rant>",1439930403

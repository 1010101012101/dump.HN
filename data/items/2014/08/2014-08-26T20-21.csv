At this point, Uber and other ride-share companies are still in that danger zone. They&#x27;re operating against the law in many cities (mine included, not that I&#x27;m complaining), and could be fined or forced to close at any moment.<p>Think it won&#x27;t happen? It happened to Aereo. Sure, they didn&#x27;t have as much money and weren&#x27;t in as many locations, but its a similar vibe: if they closed their doors tomorrow, nothing would change. They might be in the process of disrupting the market, but they haven&#x27;t won yet. They could lose everything overnight.",1409086782

I suppose a purely classical system that was entirely reversible couldn&#x27;t contain information in the time dimension because each moment would imply every other moment.

8229478,comment,8227974,8227974,1,0,userbinator,,,"The interaction between native code and JS on the DOM is certainly an area of complexity and plenty of chance for subtle bugs in a browser implementation - I wonder if the observation that native code can only manipulate the DOM in a limited fashion compared to JS could be used to simplify things.<p>For example, the initial DOM tree will be created (by native code) when loading the document, and it needs to be freed as a whole when another (or the same) page is loaded. On the other hand, JS can create/add/remove objects on it, but they must not be freed if some parts of the tree still reference them. This suggests to me that some sort of ownership scheme is appropriate, and in the case of Servo they&#x27;ve decided to make the GC own everything - which certainly makes a lot of things easy - but it might be interesting to think of whether being able to transfer object ownership between GC and something else would have any advantages, e.g. &quot;all objects in the DOM tree of the document are owned by their parent, and objects not in the DOM tree because they&#x27;ve either been removed from it or newly created by JS are owned by the GC.&quot;",1409086458

My impression is that Uber is less subtle about it, and perhaps less ethical / more aggressive, but still, competition is competition. If Lyft were such an underdog, then Uber wouldn&#x27;t be so afraid of them. From a consumer perspective, I hope that competition cools off a bit -- the price drops are great, but if they keep escalating, neither company will be particularly friendly. It would also be terrible if one company were edged out completely, ending the price wars.<p>That said, I always take Lyft -- simply because Uber doesn&#x27;t work for my phone.",1409086400

It would mean Uber believes drivers will stick with them long-term because life for drivers with them is clearly better, and the initial investment pays off in the long run, despite them having a smaller war chest to begin with.<p>Now that Uber has 5 times the funding, the same move looks like Uber is afraid of Lyft beating them in the market, and is trying to kill them early by buying off their drivers and crippling them.

If a pilot of a real plane is flying under 400ft outside of the landing or takeoff pattern in Class B airspace there&#x27;s an issue with that pilot or the plane. Model planes and real planes just don&#x27;t operate in the same airspace very often so it has not been an issue over the last 50+ years.<p>Now the big issue that&#x27;s spooking the FAA is that if you go to YouTube and search for FPV you&#x27;l find people flying their FPV planes at 2000, 3000 or even 5000ft where they become a risk to full size aircraft - even if they are only 2 or 3lbs of foam I could see them causing some damage to a jet engine. (Alt: but so do birds)<p>The small subset of idiots who bust the 400ft rule is making the FAA try to ban all FPV or outside line of sight operation which is a terrible idea as there are a lot of practical applications for model aircraft under 400ft (surveying, agriculture, logistics, Search and rescue etc) The FAA should only have jurisdiction over 500ft and in class B airspace as it has been for the past 80 years. They need to get a framework in place for licensed commercial operation under 400ft rather then just trying to ban it outright - people will do it regardless it&#x27;s better if they are certified and follow some safety rules rather then the under the table hope you don&#x27;t get caught stuff that&#x27;s going on now.",1409086275

Local governments in general don&#x27;t want to allow a lot more house building, because in 5, 10 or 20 years time when the mine closes down, having all those empty houses causes a ghost town effect where the town really will die (the towns almost always existed before the mines, and they want them to exist after the mine leaves too). That means people pay north of $1 million dollars for a fibro shack. Mining companies will hire the local showgrounds long term, so that they can build a tent city for their workers (who use the showground toilet and shower facilities etc). Local house prices will fluctuate by hundreds of thousands of dollars in days, based upon financial news from the mining companies about whether they are liking to build/expand/close the local mining operation.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s weird.<p>As for Sydney specifically, it is actually very space constrained. With the ocean on one side, and the Blue Mountains on the other side, there actually isn&#x27;t a lot of room for expansion.<p>You are correct that in general there is a lot of undeveloped coast line though (inland is basically inhospitable).

In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t write a commercial, production application with anything less than a 2.1. ;-)<p>The cost of supporting these projects early is that you&#x27;re likely to be rebuilding anyway a year from now, but I think that&#x27;s implicit in the version number.<p>In my opinion, the biggest risks of Meteor are this:<p>1. It hitched its wagon for now to mongo, so you&#x27;ll be doing the same. If you happen to believe that schemaless isn&#x27;t all its cracked up to be, that&#x27;s a real problem in production.<p>2. You&#x27;re picking both a client and a server. Sure, you can strip apart DPP or Blaze, but why would you? If you&#x27;re not wanting to benefit from Meteor&#x27;s reactivity, you can just use any server+client combo and, say, a websocket connection or something like React.js for UI components.<p>3. Meteor has a financial incentive to round up as many devs into their own ecosystem (atmosphere?). They want to sell you servers, services, et cetera, like Heroku does. Nothing wrong with that, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of.<p>For all the debate about JavaScript frameworks, I have Backbone code I wrote a relatively long time ago and it&#x27;s still durable and not being refactored. I can&#x27;t say the same for Ember or Angular code in my experience or observation. Backbone as a library is lightweight enough that I create the framework, following good design principles, that&#x27;s best for a given application. Your mileage may vary.<p>It&#x27;s not to say the people at Meteor aren&#x27;t a great bunch of people who really love what they&#x27;re making. Meteor does some interesting things and I think hopes to solve some complex problems. Hope they get there.

I think they would appreciate some designated &quot;refuel&quot; stations where they can pull up, park, pee, get coffee/red bull, and maybe vacuum or clean their cars up.<p>- I would love to be able to pick a fuel efficient car and see Lyft do a green mustache to indicate I&#x27;m making a choice for a hybrid. Maybe hybrids can get bonus payments since they can stay on the road longer per tank.<p>- Several friends have complained recently about how random the route-finding applications were that these drivers used. Some used Apple Maps, the built-in nav on the apps, or Google Maps but it wasn&#x27;t always consistent and some of the routes were TERRIBLE. Seems like an opportunity for either Lyft or Uber to build better path-finding in their largest markets via maybe highly localized traffic information or by paying off the city for access to bus/taxi lanes.",1409085481

Of course the model might not be perfect, but within the scope of each set of packages, it is demonstrably useful, because many of us are using it every day.<p>All of the people contributing packages to centralised package repositories for use with npm and gem and pip and friends are already using version control and they are already adding files to their projects to specify the dependencies for the package manager used to install their project — or in many cases, for multiple package managers, so the project can be installed multiple different ways, which is effectively just duplicated effort for no real benefit.<p>All major operating systems already come with some form of package management, though to me this is the biggest weak point at the moment. There are varying degrees of openness to third parties, and there is essentially no common ground across platforms except where a few related *nix distributions can use the same package format.<p>All major operating systems also support virtualisation to varying degrees, though again there is plenty of scope for improvement. I’ve suggested before that it would be in the interests of those building operating systems to make this kind of isolation routine for other reasons as well. However, even if full virtual machine level isolation if too heavyweight for convenient use today, usually it suffices to install the contents of packages locally within a given location in the file system and to set up any environment accordingly, and again numerous package managers already do these things in their own ways.<p>There is no need for multi-year ISO standardisation processes, and there is no need to have everything in the universe work the same way. We’re talking about tools that walk a simple graph structure, download some files, and put them somewhere on a disk, a process I could have done manually for the project I described before in about 10 minutes. A simple, consolidated version of the best tools we have today would already be sufficient to solve many real world problems, and it would provide a much better foundation for solving any harder problems later, and it would be in the interests of just about everyone to move to such a consolidated, standardised model.",1409084806

8962171,comment,8961551,8961973,0,0,jordwalke,,,"React has, from day one, sought to liberate itself from the underlying low level building blocks of a particular environment. There were always good reasons to so (normalizing browser inconsistencies etc). There is another benefit of the specific way in which we&#x27;ve built this library level layer of abstraction - we&#x27;ve formed a serializable boundary that allows vanilla React to sit on one side, and any set of lower level building blocks on the other. Before today, we simply had the DOM renderers sitting on the other side of that boundary. React Native replaces the DOM  renderers with native renderers which allows people to render platform <View>/<ScrollView>/<NativeWhatever> instead of <div>/<span>. Other than that, you get to use the exact same React API that you already know (even down to the event bubbling). You can bridge to things that are only available on the platform, and can in general make higher performance granular building blocks that cannot be accomplished with web technology (such as <Image> components that decode images more efficiently or with different concurrency models). As with everything, JSX is not required to take advantage of this - and you can use any of the compile-to-js languages that you use with React today.",1422475186

That doesn&#x27;t mean the theory is wrong, but this article gives no evidence in favor of it!<p>For example, it claims that they couldn&#x27;t have surrendered because of the destructive power of the bomb, because there had been worse bombing raids.  First of all, the Japanese could have considered those bombing raids to have been lucky.  It is also possible that the raids that caused more damage were in much larger cities, such as Tokyo.  It is also possible that the psychological effect was greater for nuclear weapons.  The Japanese had no idea how many nuclear weapons we had.  They may have thought that the first two were warnings, and if they didn&#x27;t surrender we would start dropping 30 every hour until they were obliterated.  If, as the article says, bombing raids were carried out by 500 bombers at a time, why didn&#x27;t the Japanese have every reason to believe the next major raid would drop 500 nuclear weapons?<p>The article also contradicts itself.  It says that the bomb couldn&#x27;t have swayed the supreme council, since news only arrived after they had met and the vote to surrender was deadlocked... I mean, what?  Only if they had already surrendered before they got the news would the bomb be proved irrelevant.  They voted and did not surrender, and yet after news of the bomb arrived they in fact met again and then did vote to surrender.<p>There is no doubt that the bomb would have a huge psychological impact beyond merely the measurements of the damage it did.<p>Thought experiment:  A boxer is set to fight the Champ. Which of these situations is more likely to cause the boxer to back out of the match?<p>1. The boxer learns that the Champ once beat another boxer for round after round, and in the 12th round the boxer finally died from his cumulative injuries.<p>2. The boxer learns that the Champ always carries a gun to the ring and shoots his opponent in the face before the fight even starts.<p>In one scenario you may think you are going to lose, but at least you&#x27;ll go down swinging and maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky somehow.  In the other, he is going to murder you with a bullet and all you have is boxing gloves and no shirt.",1422475053

The machine shouldn&#x27;t be able to assume the field is empty. And since it&#x27;s neither brainless nor can it have guards over the cutting implements, the next best thing is an area-of-denial zone around/in front of the tractor; pierce the zone and the tractor halts as fast as possible. And that pretty much leaves you with a vision system to watch for that zone violation.<p>(It&#x27;s easy to thoughtlessly make a minor mistake or forget something for just a second that otherwise appears to be a Darwin Award nomination.

The details of tipping can be difficult as they change based on contextual factors.  This is why tipping is a gentleman’s task.  It takes effort and focus to carry out an appropriate tip.  Slate and TipThePizzaGuy.com note that specifically when tipping delivery workers its fair to receive a minimum tip of $3, while 15 percent tip a common courtesy and for an order that is $50 or more, it’s within reason to tip as low as 10 percent.  MidCurrent Fly Fishing reinforces this bottom end of normal, stating: “figure in 15 percent for an average level of service from an independent fly fishing guide, but not less than 10 percent.” However, when in doubt NYCTourist focuses on standard percentage based tipping as opposed to flat rate tipping.  Taking time to figure out an appropriate tip is challenging.  Tipping can be a way to show a girl that you care about the little things and be what separates a boy from a gentleman.",,1422474941

Microsoft gives regular access to its Windows source code for auditing to Russia, China and other countries.<p>Combine this with recent activity on the US&#x27;s behalf to backdoor services in China, for example giving US Federal agents access to the GMail accounts of Chinese nationals. Projects like this in the United States are not atypical.

We&#x27;ve also learned that the United States CIA created a Twitter-like service under a front corporation, deployed it in Cuba, and used it to attempt to foment a revolution (in 2014). The United States Department of Defense has studied how to propagandize entire countries, in fact entire regions of the world, over Twitter and social media.

Promises are an effective implementation of control flow for ES5 JS, but don&#x27;t really improve program structure.  They are most useful &quot;under-the-hood&quot;, as TameJS/Iced-CS creates when compiling.<p>The overarching solution is to be &quot;flat&quot; by using small, composable functions.  Lazy.js and Highland.js force the user to do this but require learning a specific syntax.  Streams make this technique easier to reason about (easier say, than Transducers or Generators), but the goal is the same: operate on one object at a time with one purpose, and return a result in a standard manner so it&#x27;s easy to consume with the next function.  This is good practice, but leaning on one of these libraries is an excuse to force the practice.<p>Chained callbacks is JS looking from the inside out; looking from the outside in, we see this practice is solved by many other languages [1] -- not just serial calls but parallel also!  C#, Scala, Python, Java, Dart, Spiderjs and more have implementations of Futures [2].<p>Fibers implement Futures but require a native module for V8 -- since they are not portable outside Node they don&#x27;t have great adoption and aren&#x27;t used in almost any node.js modules: only ~100 out of the endless ecosystem [3].<p>Fibers, Async.js, and Highland also aren&#x27;t syntactically an improvement over Promises -- the point of programming, which devs will get tunnel vision and forget -- is to leverage the language to do more work for less keystrokes/manhours [4].  The compiler should create control flow for my code, not the other way around.  There should be no reason to learn a complex API just to get serial/parallel calls, when a simple keyword addition to the language will suffice.<p>Not to mention, await/defer is so readable that new devs can start working with async code right away, without needing to research.  This is not the case with promises/fibers/asyncjs/highland or whatever flavor-of-the-month a shop has picked for control flow.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/KjellSchubert/promise-future-task"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/KjellSchubert/promise-future-task</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises#List_of_implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises#List_of_im...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://blog.teamleadnet.com/2013/08/async-await-in-net-is-not-for.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.teamleadnet.com/2013/08/async-await-in-net-is-no...</a>",1422474455

In general, the law requires that a patient be able to access all the medical data that they generate; it&#x27;s part of their health record, and (with very few exceptions) they have a right to know the contents of it.<p>Unfortunately, as patients begin automatically generating data -- for instance, pacemakers that automatically dump ECG data to a doctor&#x27;s office, or implantable neurostimulators that automatically dump EEG data -- there have been real concerns lately over whether they can access the data in a standardized format (or, in reality, whether they can access it at all!).  Companies have been somewhat reticent to give patients access to what they perceive as proprietary machine learning data that their device has collected.<p>Hugh Campos discusses this in a talk he gave at one point: <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2012/09/28/why-cant-pacemaker-users-rea.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2012/09/28/why-cant-pacemaker-users-re...</a><p>It would be interesting to know if patients have access to implanted EEG data (perhaps they could use it to measure sleep, if they could access it?).

Every night, young guys and girls who work as valets are told by patrons that they would like to show appreciation with a tip, but the patron does not have cash. This situation has become such a problem that the valets have tried to address the issue. Many valets are using mobile card readers, such as Square or Paypal card readers.<p>While mobile card readers are amazing devices, they do not properly address the psychology of gratuity. They create an awkward interchange that requires the valet to make the ask, pull out the device, and run the card. The card readers diminish the self reward tippers experience by making the process seem transactional. TipEasy is beautifully built to support the psychology of gratuity and allow for an indirect experience which both parties get their rewards.<p>Download TipEasy.com mobile app today and sign up to send and/or receive Tips.

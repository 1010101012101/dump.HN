If a small publisher I like publishes new books, my favorite sport team has some important news, etc., I'd like to know about it, and Facebook slowly became the best facilitator of such ""friendships"". I think it is somewhat different from normal advertising, and was slowly transforming the perceptions of the commercial entities themselves.<p>But now, FB has strated breaking that model, differntiating between human friends and the other (paying) kind.",1352836766

A couple months ago someone had mentioned the Holden snowboarding company. We did some research on trademark fair use, and ultimately agreed that because Holden was a geographic area, and because we werent doing outerwear or snowboard gear, and because our clothes wont have any visible logos, thered be no chance a consumer would confuse the brands. A handful of people</i> on HackerNews pointed out that it might be more of a conflict than anticipated.*<p>Holden sells all sorts of clothes, including the type of shirts you would be selling.

4780237,comment,4779844,4779844,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I liked the intro. There is another use for options, which is insuring against lost gain. Allow me to share a couple of anecdotes.<p>In January of '95 I knew my 3rd child was on the way and wanted a 'sedan' type car to take the family out. (we had my sports car and a mini-van at the time) I was working at Sun and had been participating in the Employee stock purchase program forever, and Sun stock had gone up a bit so I sold 1,000 shares at $37/share which after taxes and fees netted me enough cash to buy a Chrysler sedan for cash. No loan, no payments, pink slip on the first day I owned it. That was an <i>awesome</i> feeling. In March of that year Sun announced Java, the stock ended up doubling and splitting 3 times. The car I paid 'cash' for was worth 1.6M$ (at the peak of Sun's stock value). Youch!<p>So my Dad's buddy, a Swiss ex-banker, chastised me for not hedging my bet by buying an 'out of the money' call option, 12 months out. He explained that if the stock never went anywhere it would lower the effective 'gain' from my sale, but if the stock went up a lot it would protect me against having lost out on that value.<p>Flash forward to 2006, I'm heading for Google, I've got a chunk of NetApp stock and I having lived through the dot com crash I want to diversify. So I sell a lot of my NetApp stock at $35, <i>and</i> buy options for the same amount of stock a year out at $40. (so 'out of the money' by $5). NetApp kept going up and up, and I sold the options a month before they were due (NetApp was trading at $55 and I wanted to keep the gain in the the right tax year) and I got a nice 'bonus' payout on what was essentially the same stock I had sold nearly a year earlier.<p>The option was there only to protect against missing out on a large rise in the stock price. (which it did, not as well as if I had kept it all but I didn't miss out completely either).<p>I found that I would keep stocks longer than I should because I was 'worried' about whether or not it was the right time to sell. Options allow you to 'buy insurance' on against that worry, and for me that has made me more willing to make significant changes in my portfolio over the years.",1352836694

We are very rapidly replacing the jobs of tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of people. We are creating jobs elsewhere as a result - but the intersection of these new jobs with the skills of the unemployed is very low, and the nature of these new jobs also means retraining is becoming harder, not easier.",1352836640

But you CAN get high leverage for stock trading, and you CAN restrict yourself to a small part of your capital thus ""deleveraging"" the effect of options on your portfolio. You need to have some experience, but definitely of the calibre of a Fugu chef, to practice these.<p>I think the close proper analogy is the stocks are a sharp household knife, and options are a butcher's knife.",1352836599

It's a place where like minded people accumulate. People who think they can change the world by creating the next big think. All these people could all be delusional and totally wrong for all we know, but the point is they all think that way.<p>It's like a party. Can you just jack up the radio and dance away in the solitude of your room? Sure, you can. But it's better to go to a real discotheque and dance away with others. The chances you meet someone interesting are higher, the chances that your amazing disco steps get noticed are higher etc etc.<p>Continuing the stupid analogy, in the valley there are these page 3 reporters (techcrunch, cough) reporting all sorts of things. These things make you famous and get you $$. See, how things are different when you are hacking away in your room in cape town? Want more developers? There are tons of people who will code for you.

4780087,comment,4779399,4779687,56,0,bokonist,,,"Software is generally a winner-take-all market.  Software has zero marginal cost, so the company with the most revenue can invest the most upfront into making a better product, giving it even more revenue.  Furthermore, in most cases there is little incentive for customers to ever use the second best product in a segment.  So when building software, you not only have to meet the customers needs, you have to meet the customer needs better than any competitor.  If you produce a product that is half as good or improve the product half as quickly, you do not lose just half your revenue, you could lose all of it.<p>The second aspect of software development is that a developer working 40 hours a week is more productive than two developers working 20 hours a week.  With the sole developer, there less communication overhead, less management overhead, and the ratio of productive time to time learning the system and understanding the interlocking parts is higher.  This is the classic mythical man month problem.<p>The third aspect of software development is that directly measuring output and effort of an engineer is very difficult.  So as a proxy, managers look for signs of passion and engagement.   If you are passionate and smart, but are slow to implement some feature, management will believe the feature was simply more difficult than anticipated.  If you generally are not passionate about your work, and are slow to implement some feature, management will think you are slacking and fire you.  Creating an effective company requires creating a culture of passion and hardwork, and having one person only work part-time can decrease the morale of those putting in 40+ hours.  Asking to only work half-time betrays a lack of passion, and could be a bad career move.<p>So the net result of these factors is that a company must work at maximum efficiency, and maximum efficiency comes when all developers are working 40+ hours a week.  It is not in the company's interest to let you work only 20 hours a week, and it could indeed be risky if you bring the idea up with management.<p>I should also note that the above dynamic is not just the case in software, but in virtually all high paying jobs, from professional athlete to corporate lawyer to corporate executive.  Virtually all high paying jobs have some sort of competitive, winner take all dynamic in the market at large (the winners being the ones who get paid well), and within the company, the high paid people are the ones with specialized, hard to replace skills, that have a large ramp up time to learn effectively (learning a large code base, learning a set of legal traditions, learning how to hit a curveball, etc, etc).  Thus in order to earn the high pay you must work long hours, and you must work many productive hours on top of a base of ramping-up hours.",1352835108

You're probably willing to pay $50 for software that solves your problems, because you probably make software yourself, and you know that it costs money to create software; an analogy can be made here. But if a barebones dictionary works for you, then it works for you, and don't worry about it.<p>So what is a good dictionary? Here's a tentative  answer. A good dictionary provides pithy, useful definitions that reflect the words' differing meanings over time and differing contexts. Most good dictionaries also provide style and usage guidelines (e.g., ""When should I use 'lie' and when should I use 'lay'?""), and a good dictionary will also provide a word's etymology.  Many free dictionary apps use data from WordNet, which is an amazing resource, but its focus is on tagging words with taxonomic properties (sorry, a better phrase isn't coming to me right now) and defining the relationships between those words, all of which is very useful for general linguistics and NLP research. The quality of the definitions fall short, and you should be able to confirm this by comparing just about any WordNet definition to a definition from a good dictionary at your library.<p>I was hoping to find a better example, but to give yourself an idea of the research problems that can be solved with a good dictionary, consider reading this brief student's guide to using the OED:<p><a href=""http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/oedguide.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~wcd/oedguide.htm</a>",1352834084

Unfortunately, people don't work this way. Telling people that they haven't measured up to some arbitrary standard is a significant demotivator. If you are measuring your workers on some chart, they'll begin either gaming the chart or comparing against each other, neither of which will motivate them to do better work - it will motivate them to optimize whatever you're measuring. I saw this at my last job and it was blindingly, painfully obvious how bad of an idea it was but management kept it up.<p>Take a support staff for example. What do you measure? How many calls they make? That incentivizes making lots of short calls. How many notes about clients calls they made? That incentivizes leaving lots of minimum length notes. Am I a worse support staff member if I leave longer notes and make longer calls? How do you accurately measure the ""results"" of a support staff? By customer retention? Good luck correlating individual client retention to specific support staff when customers talk to many different employees during a sales or support process.<p>Once you get past people who create objective value for the company, measurements are difficult to impossible.

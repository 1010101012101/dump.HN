That doesn't mean free weights take the place of your other activities such as skiing or mountain climbing.  That doesn't mean that you cut out cardio, that's something else entirely, even though some people work on cardio in the gym along with strength training.<p>Free weights are also great for building the entire structure of your body.  There is nothing which can stress the major muscles of the legs, bones and supporting muscle groups like throwing a huge weight on your shoulders and squatting that weight multiple times.  Swimming, isometrics and all that other stuff won't do it.  Machines also don't do this because you don't have weight to stabilize in both directions.  The power move of the squat is to push upwards with your legs but you still have to lower that huge weight in an orderly down movement to start the exercise.",1299235803

In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan spells it out very well, but I'll just give you my simple definition: Eating healthy is as close to eating dirt without actually eating dirt.

He would spend most of his days eating what grew from the ground and when they finally hunted down meat, they would eat their catch as a group[2]. That doesn't mean you have to do exactly that, but try to keep your eating habits in sync with what it was originally adapted to consume not what hyper stimulates made you believe it wanted to consume[3].<p>Now don't go about forcing yourself to eat stuff you don't enjoy. In the same manner jasonkester engages in something he enjoys that have the ""side effect"" of being healthy (I still think these activities are something we were adapted to engage in the first place), find foods you find delicious but also happen to be something that isn't processed. I can assure you that there is plenty of ""healthy"" or ""natural"" foods out there that you would enjoy[4].<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_bittman_on_what_s_wrong_with_what_we_eat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/mark_bittman_on_what_s_wrong_with_w...</a><p>[1.5]<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=eating-made-simple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=eating-made...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3723678050599653349#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3723678050599653349#</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzN-uIVkfjg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzN-uIVkfjg</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://smittenkitchen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smittenkitchen.com/</a>",1299235258

2287617,comment,2279655,2285112,0,0,v21,,,"No, my point is that disruptive students will drag down all the scores of the entire class. In addition, you have to assume for your corrections that the level of disruption is consistent across subjects and time - ie a disruptive class might collectively be less disruptive when playing PE. Or that the kids change their behaviour over time. Or that there aren't more complex interactions between disruptive behaviour and different teachers (an example might be - kids might be less disruptive just after lunch, because they've just eaten and are sleepy. If you teach ""the bad class"" in a after-lunch slot, you'll appear better than your colleagues.) And - my (UK) experience, up until the age of 11, is that we had a single ""home room"" teacher, who taught the majority of our lessons, regardless of subject. We changed home-room (and hence main teacher) once a year.<p>And we haven't even got into the troublesome part of reducing a student's behaviour to a single number. Or the unfortunate way that useful correlates of underlying behaviour stop being useful correlates once you reward people for meeting them. (I'm sure there's a name for this phenomenon, but I have forgotten it)<p>I support the idea of collecting data. I obviously want to analyse it as rigorously as possible. But there are just too many complex interactions going on when you have 30 people in a room trying to learn for our statistics to produce reliable numbers. At least, that's my intuition. It occurs to me that if you actually collected the data, you could do an ANOVA, and have a reasonable stab at attributing the variation in outcomes to various factors, such as individual students, teachers, subjects, the class they're in, interactions between any combination of the above, and ""other"". You'll need a lot of data, mind. My guess is <10% of the variance would come down to the teacher alone. But this is just a guess - no doubt people have done this before. They've probably done it multiple times, with different answers depending on the different measures they used, whether they adjusted for socioeconomic factors etc. There's probably review articles summarizing those.",1299234534

I think a good way to look at it is that Apple built the iPod because they LOVE music as a company.  I know some people will think it's a marketing gimmick but it's clear that Jobs & Apple are true music fans and to them, the dearth of a player that could hold thousands of songs drove them to think about a solution that could solve that problem.",1299233666

You have to set expectations clearly - if they're not paying for a $3k website, they're not getting a $3k website.  (most people will still expect that quality even if they're paying less, for whatever reason)  Be clear with them about what they're getting.<p>2.  If you have enough work at that price, don't bother.  My guess from you posting this is that you want their business.",1299233622

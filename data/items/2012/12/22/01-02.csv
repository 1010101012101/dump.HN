4955473,comment,4954170,4954170,2,0,bhauer,,,"Analyses that repeat the post PC mantra in its various forms may be correct in doing so, but the mantra is getting threadbare.  Since Ive read this sort of thinking so many times (desktops are dead, Intel is doomed, ARM is the new hotness, etc.), I dont find it terribly interesting to hear the same restated.  Dont get me wrong, I appreciate the detailed analysis provided by the author, but the thesis is unsurprising.<p>Heres what I would like to read if a technology journalist could dig it up: What kind of strategic planning is going on within the halls of Intel, Dell, HP, Lenovo, et al with respect to keeping the desktop PC relevant?  Put another way: I find it astonishing that several years have been allowed to pass since desktop performance became good enough.  The key is disrupting what people think is good enough.<p>The average consumer desktop and business desktop user does consider their desktops performance to be good enough.  But this is an artifact of the manufacturers failing to give consumers anything to lust for.<p>Opinions may vary, but I strongly believe that the major failure for desktop PCs in the past five years has been the display.  I use three monitors--two 30 and one 24--and I want more.  I want a 60 desktop display with 200dpi resolution.  I would pay dearly for such a display.  I want Avatar/Minority Report style UIs (well, a realistic and practical gesture-based UI, but these science-fiction films provided a vision that most people will relate to).<p>I cant even conceive of how frustrating it is to use a desktop PC with a single monitor, especially something small and low-resolution like a 24 inch 1920x1080 monitor.  And yet, most users would consider 24 1920x1080 to be large and high definition, or in other words, good enough.<p>Thats the problem, though.  As long as users continue to conceive of the desktop in such constrained ways, it seems like a dead-end.  You only need so much CPU and GPU horsepower to display 2D Office documents at such a low resolution.\nThere was a great picture CNet had in one of their reports (and I grabbed a copy at my blog [1]) showing a user holding and using a tablet while sitting at a desktop PC.<p>In the photo, the PC has two small monitors and is probably considered good enough to get work done.  But the user finds the tablet more productive.  This user should be excused for the seemingly inefficient use of resources because its probably not actually inefficient at all.  The tablet is probably easier to read (crisper, brighter display) and faster, or at least feels faster than the PC simply because its newer.<p>Had desktop displays innovated for the past decade, the PC would need to be upgraded.  Its CPU, GPU, memory, and most likely disk capacity and network would need to be beefier to drive a large, high-resolution display.\nSo again, what are the PC manufacturers doing to disrupt users notions of good enough, to make users WANT to upgrade their desktops?  I say the display is the key.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/i-see-the-problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/i-see-the-problem</a>",1356141471

I bought it from the Microsoft Store website, because it was $200 cheaper than buying it from Lenovo (even with discount codes from dealnews.com)<p>So, as I was checking out, the store asks me if I would like to pay $80 more for ""Microsoft Signature"" setup. Given that I was going to run Linux, I was already upset at the implicit Windows tax, and declined without even checking what ""Microsoft Signature"" was. Especially since the whole thing was $650, so $80 is almost a 15% increase.<p>Three days later, I get the thing, and the box says ""with Microsoft Signature"". I first looked to see that they did not charge me for it. And then, just before calling to shout at them for installing crapware I didn't ask for, I checked what ""Microsoft Signature"" really means. Lo and behold, it means ""Lack of manufacturer crapware"".<p>Microsoft was offering to charge me $80 more so that I would only get Microsoft software out of the box.<p>(The Intel Inside and Win7 stickers were still there, however)",1356141422

4955437,comment,4954170,4954468,2,0,twotwotwo,,,"I don't know that X86 can't grow over time (servers) but I think you're spot on that dirt cheap chips, and big companies that want to keep them dirt cheap, are in some sense Intel's deeper problem. Intel could make up any given technical gap eventually, but it's hard for them to shut down competition when other, very well-funded players want to maintain it.<p>But on the flipside, ARM right now is very, very low-end -- the fancy new Cortex-A15s only match up against Atoms in single-thread CPU performance, and Atom < ULV < LV < desktop/server. You get away with it in mobile because of lower user expectations and heavy use of the GPU. When you look a little further out (Cortex-A53/57 on newer processes) you can picture ARM in actual client computers, or at least in super-zippy mobile gadgets that some people will happily replace their computers with. (Consumer software will probably adapt to an ARMy world too--use the GPU well, adapt to slower cores, use UI tricks to hide some CPU-caused delays.)<p>But I can't see an ARM chip that acts exactly like a Xeon within the next few years. I bet ARM finds some niches in the datacenter, where servers today have far more CPU than they need, or applications adapt well to a sea of tiny slow cores, or both. (For instance, Facebook uses AMD memcached boxes; they could just as well use ARM, and are looking at it. Intel will make cheap slow cores for those use cases, too.) And I bet ARM will put some price pressure on Intel. But all the things a top-of-the-line Intel chip does to maximize instruction-level parallelism will be really hard for anyone to copy for a very long time.",1356140726
4955436,comment,4953479,4955128,6,0,electromagnetic,,,"> The second question is whether the TSA's more onerous policies, like use of full-body scanners and bans on liquids, prevent fatal bombings of airliners (not hijackings).<p>The thing most people don't know is that the reaction of Acetone and Hydrogen Peroxide produces nothing but heat. If mixed in the bathroom out of the smell of anybody, it can be left in a bottle and looking like pure water. It will slowly crystallize acetone peroxide as the reaction occurs. Given enough time - like a 7 hour flight - you could have sufficient quantities of highly reactive acetone peroxide crystals that would likely go off at the slightest movement even while still in a liquid. So screw the bathroom, it's under any seat in any backpack.<p>Most people think of the anarchist cookbook method that uses an acid to form it, which works in creating DADP or TATP which are the more stable variants. However they require a lot of ice, and still take a lot of time anyway.<p>Even a water bottle full of the mixture would produce a sizeable amount of explosive (assuming using 30% hydrogen peroxide). The fucked up thing being I can grab a can of acetone and a can of hydrogen peroxide (wood stain remover) at home depot for under $20.<p>The only question is how do you get it in? Boil a bottle of water and you can pop the lid off it without breaking the seal, keep that in boiling water, refill the bottle with what you want, take the lid out and push it back over, when its cooled it looks like new.

Right after they introduce Bill Gates' high tech toilet.  In all seriousness, the sad truth is some projects will not be driven to completion by market forces.  They require ""brute force"" (personal wealth and force of will) to make them happen.  Gates' push for a malaria vaccine was one.  Glaxo, as a ""rational actor"", would not have finished that project if not for all the free Gates Foundation funding.  Truly an amazing achievement.  However, his former CTO appears to be cut from a different cloth.  His brute forced idea is IV.  Not, e.g., a device to kill malaria carrying parasites with lasers, or any other such noble invention (they have plenty of examples to feed the press I'm sure), but a company to _license_ that invention, for a _price_... _if_ it can find a _suitable_ licensee.  Big difference.  Back in the real world...<p>Finding suitable entrepreneurs to take great ideas covered by someone else's patents forward is not how IV makes money.  (Nor is it usually how great ideas reach the market.  Theoretically of course it sounds great.)

There was a long-running achievement called ""What a Strange Long Journey it has Been"", which took at least a year in real-time to complete, and you had to actively play during each of the ten or so in-game festivals and holidays, and do some quests and tasks during each. If you missed a festival, you had to wait another year to do it again, so if you were aiming for the achievement, you really wanted to do it in one go.<p>During their version of Valentine's, each player got a bag of heart-shaped candy, and the task you had to complete was to pull out at least one each of the eight different heart candies. But you could only pull a piece of candy once every hour or so, each time you pulled a piece you had a 1/8 chance to get a certain piece, but the holiday was time-limited, so you had about two weeks to complete it.<p>Sounds easy and fair, right? 1/8 chance, get all eight pieces, two whole weeks, easy! Except that there was one piece that I just never got. The piece that said ""I LOVE YOU!"". And as the time went by, I got more and more frantic, logged in more often so as not to miss any opportunity to pull a piece of candy, but no luck.<p>So, I did a quick bit of math. You can pull one piece every hour for two weeks, but sleeping, not playing, missing days etc, meant that I effectively pulled ~100 pieces. The chance of missing a certain piece is 7/8, so missing a certain piece 100 times in a row is (7/8)^100, which is roughly a little bit more than one in a million.<p>With ten million players all doing the same thing, there's going to be a number of them that will hit that ""one in a million"" chance, which means that whoever designed that part of the achievement didn't do their homework, didn't do the math. Because intuition tells you that 1/8 chance is plenty! Hundreds of tries, of course everyone will get all pieces! Except proper math tells you otherwise, and I was one of the ""lucky"" outliers.<p>(Later, they apologized and retroactively removed that part of the achievement, so I got my purple nether-drake mount without having to wait a year extra.)",1356139020

Also, I feel it would be better to be able to tinker in real-time to see what functions / flows / works the best.<p>So, is there a special job title I can seek out for such a person?

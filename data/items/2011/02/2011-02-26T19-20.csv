Now Universal Pictures takes a loss on the movie by moving all of the profits to Universal DVD Distribution or some other company under the ""Universal"" umbrella. So that other corp has record profits, while the one you hold the contract with reports a loss.

This is more or less like the old money days when moneyed people didn't have to work, and people who have no money could not find work.<p>Bitcoins also doesn't solve the problem of derivative bitcoins, e.g. futures and debts.

2266305,comment,2266083,2266083,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"By way of contrast: a friend of mine was once working on a contract job in Visual Basic.  One day he edited an ""if"" statement which basically said (I don't know VB syntax, but this will give you the idea):<p><pre><code>  (0) if foo() then do_something() else do_something_else()
</code></pre>
It turned out that it was unnecessary to do anything in the ""then"" branch:<p><pre><code>  (1) if foo() then no_op else do_something_else()
</code></pre>
My friend, quite naturally, changed that to this:<p><pre><code>  (2) if not foo() then do_something_else()
</code></pre>
After several hours of frustration, my friend finally realized that the transformation from (1) to (2) is not valid in Visual Basic.  How can this be?  As I recall, there is some false value in VB such that its negation is also false.<p>This is the kind of hell languages create when they try to be helpful by having lots of different false values (0, the empty string, the empty list, and of course ""false"") and at the same time have lots of implicit conversions.<p>So, be glad that Clojure has only two ""falsey"" values.",1298748854

But here's my take anyway. :D<p>You can always find something that is not right.<p>> Adam and Eve were perfect. Then they chose not to be perfect.<p>According to the bible, they didn't know exactly what will happen if they eat from the tree, hence they didn't chose, they were tricked. If they were perfect they should have asked God before they tasted it. The story kind of makes me feel that humans were created to be fools according to the bible.<p>The story condemns curiosity which is one of the best human traits, without it, we'd be still in the stone age. And of course a hood 'nerd' has to be curious.<p>> God wanted people to have the ability to love Him of their own free will.<p>Why not just create love, it would save a lot of time, I know love is not a substance to us... but someone almighty could surely create it.<p>> Because Satan still serves a purpose. I'm not entirely sure of all of it, but the main purpose seems to be to provide an obvious choice for us. God or Satan, who do you want to serve?<p>This sounds like God is playing a game with Satan, a very cruel game if you ask me and pointless too, because God knows how it will end anyway. And it also seems that he doesn't kill Satan because then he'd be bored.<p>About the free will thing:<p>Let's say you create robots and program them slightly differently. And let then interact with each other. In their view they have free will, in your context however you know exactly what they gonna do, you could calculate it all in advance. So in the end we may not even have free will, we are just complicated.<p>Se my other comments here, I am not saying that God does not exist, I am saying that the Christian religion is probably wrong about it, it can't be that way.",1298748843

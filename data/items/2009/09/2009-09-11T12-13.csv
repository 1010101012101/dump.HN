This is true, except that in the case of artists it's incredibly difficult to assume personal responsibility for their own success. Let's say some struggling writer's day job is a programmer (a not uncommon situation). If this person dedicates a good amount of time towards programming, enjoys it and sticks with it, honing their craft day by day then it's a pretty sure thing that those choices will pay off in the form of a decent job and comfortable salary.<p>There is nothing he can do to guarantee that his writing will pay off no matter what career and life choices he makes.<p>Now here's my main point: there is no fundamental difference between the process required to become a good programmer and the process required to become a good writer. The personal choices, decisions and personal(* ) rewards required to stick with and become capable at both are almost identical.<p>Why on earth is this woman trying to maintain that 'Art' is some esoteric special case that should be treated any differently from so many other identical processes?<p>(* ) By 'personal rewards' I mean that the level of self worth and enjoyment for engaging in any classically 'artistic' process is often exactly the same as that enjoyed by scientists thinking about new theories, architects thinking about beautiful design, programmers having a eureka moment with code or any number of similar experiences across any number of professions.<p>EDIT: I'll also just take a second to respond to this part of your comment:
<i>Just like if someone wanted to work 2 or 3 days a week to spend more time with their kids, or take 6 month holidays every year to wander in the Andes.</i><p>The comparison between taking a holiday or spending time with the kids and engaging in some artistic process - as if 'doing art' is the same as taking a holiday is exactly what I think this woman is promoting and it's exactly what I think is so moronic about the article.

I think he's saying that it's a mistake to take one theory, with one notation, and imagine that just because it is correct and covers all the cases, it is the one ""truth"". It sounds like solipsism: wanting a predicable  and self-contained world that is safe and controlled.
But there are a few strange things about different notations that mean the same thing:<p>- notations have usability. Each one makes it easier or harder to do certain things. One notation might be good at one task, and poor at another; whereas another notation vice versa, even though both are equally ""true"". Notations also make it harder or easier to think/reason about certain things, in the way that language tends to shape our thoughts (not determine them, Dr. Whorf).<p>- notations are similar or different to related concepts and notations, making some connections easier to see, and some harder.<p>- notations generalize differently, having different suggestions for the ""obvious"" next step.<p>A particular notation is then just a shadow of the truth - a one dimensional projection, capturing only a plane of the unseen reality. It seems that mathematicians and scientists routinely invent new notations for new domains (not necessarily good ones). The advantages of different notations is what Alan Kay was talking about when he said that ""point of view is worth 80 IQ points"". Notation is a form of point of view.<p><i>It was based on a few things from the past like how smart you had to be in Roman times to multiply two numbers together; only geniuses did it. We haven't gotten any smarter, we've just changed our representation system.

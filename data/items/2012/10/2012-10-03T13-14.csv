They're used in theorem proving - verification, dependent typing, contracts - scheduling, planning, and for understanding/modelling cell regulatory networks in biology.<p>Satisfiability stuff is interesting because it shows that just because something is NP-complete doesn't mean that it is unapproachable or 'hard' (just as linear programming shows just cause something is in P doesn't mean it is 'easy' - for large values of easy). To ground the concept you can roughly categorize it with logic programming, answer set programming, constraint satisfaction and integer programming. I've made use of answer set programming for certain planning problems as a kind of better prolog but SMT is a 'bit' more flexible.",1349272695

It seems entirely reasonable that they should be able to choose their own terms, and, similarly, if employee candidates don't like those terms, they don't take the job.<p>What you've done here is subtly shifted the frame of the discussion. You make it sound like if she didn't sign the contract, she'd be <i>fired</i>. That's not at all what happened, is it?. As a prospective hire at one of the most ""prestigious"" VC firms in the country, this person no doubt had many options for where to work next. Kleiner extended her an offer and with it an employment contract, right? If she didn't think she could keep the promises in that contract, she should have gone somewhere else.<p>I'm also not sure what their being a ""VC firm"" has to do with who pays legal fees. The rules aren't different for ""rich"" firms and ""poor"" firms. People make frivolous claims to both kinds of companies, and larger companies shouldn't have to shoulder the legal costs of fending off bogus claims simply because they're larger. Obviously, if KPCB is wrong about what happened, it's they who will be paying the legal fees. What matters is who's right and who's wrong, not which side of the conflict is easier to caricature.<p>I have no opinion about the sexual harassment charge itself, nor do I think that ""non-disparagement"" clauses should (or even can) prevent someone from litigating a sexual harassment or discrimination charge, or even from making a case to the public about them. No doubt KPCB's lawyers want that clause to shut down the drama, but there's a public interest issue involved in firms forcing employees out due to sexual discrimination or harassment.<p>The reality here is probably that you don't know anything about what happened with Ellen Pao and Kleiner Perkins, but that this is a message board and so you feel it's appropriate to litigate the issue with cartoons. I wish you'd not do that. It makes us all dumber.<p><i>Late edit: 5 minutes of Google research suggests that non-disparagement clauses are not enforceable in matters of discrimination and, broadly, in public interest cases of all stripes; similarly (you may have already known this), where non-compete agreements are valid, they are still not enforceable when they directly harm the public interest.</i>",1349271960

I usually recommend people added mockjax to existing projects, but if it is a new project recommend using amplify.request. The amplify.request piece enables you to do some things you can't easily with mockjax. For example, amplify.request allows you to change the caching strategy in the define statements and not where the request is being made. Also if the data from the server changes you can add a decoder to the define statement to map the data to what your code expects. Or if the data going out changes you can add a dataMap to the define statement to so your main application code doesn't have to change. You can also create a custom request type other than jQuery AJAX (think maybe websockets or Dojo's ajax). I sometimes use mockjax also in a jsFiddle or demo code where I don't want to get into amplify.request and just want to use out of the box jQuery.ajax. Thanks for your comment.",1349271836

This can be described as an emotional left/right that may or may not correlate with economics. (Many libertarians are emotionally leftist-- they despise centralized power-- but economically toward the right. They just happen to see governments as more of an enemy than corporations... and I disagree with them, but that's another story.) This whole mess is probably the result of a failed negotiation and we have no way of knowing who failed, miscommunicated, or did wrong.<p>If there isn't much hard evidence (and in this case, there's not) then people will tend to side with power if they're emotionally rightist and against power if they're emotional leftists. (I'm an emotional leftist, as you can probably tell.)<p>What you discover when you become a whistleblower is that about 70 percent of people are on the emotional right. They think they're in the center because they don't reject the whistleblower out of hand (instead, they complain that ""she may be right, but she didn't use proper channels and <i>I</i> certainly want nothing to do with this matter."") That's not always a bad thing; the powerful entity is known, and the whistleblower is a total unknown, and people tend to be afraid of unknowns. It does, however, make it very difficult to be an effective whistleblower. Worse yet, an even larger percentage of people in positions of power (such as future employers) are on the emotional right.<p>White-collar employment culture is emotionally rightist in the extreme; if your ex-company says you weren't a leader and you say you were, they're often taken to be right and you're wrong. It's extremely unfortunate and wrong that it's this way, but I don't see how it could be any different (surprise: high-ranking people in powerful institutions tend to side with power) but it is something one needs to be aware of.",1349269844

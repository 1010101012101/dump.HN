(on not having access to your passwords). iPhone with them helps. (yes, i have to unlock that db with my hashing password). But in reality, I prefer that I can't get access to my email/facebook/whatever without having my machine. If i'm at work, I should be working... but it's the same machine anyhow ;)<p>b. true about stealing my machine. But again, my passwords are locked by my one key control password (which i don't easily remember either... yay for muscle memory ;)). Yes, it's a SPoF.<p>c. I clarified with Little Snitch. I don't really care that much. Because you're right: if one company screws you over and unveils your passwords, then having a scenario where people could then log into your email or bank means end of identity and a life of credit hell.<p>I just think that having a predictable password scheme is about the same as having <i>the same</i> password. If it's easy to guess, then you may as well have the same. IMHO, the only way to guarantee against any problems if one of your passwords is exposed is to go random. :)",1256093403

And, decades later, no matter how hard I work at the social stuff, I routinely run into crapola from other people who are just waiting to pounce on the chance to blame me (or some other bright person) for something going wrong in their life.  If I share helpful tips at work, it gets interpreted as me ""bragging"" rather than trying to help.  And I have repeatedly been in educational settings, both related to my job and in college settings, where the instructor was all too willing to hold me up as an ""example"" in the worst possible way for me personally and to blame me as the reason they couldn't curve the grade more.<p>In one case, I quietly pulled my professor aside and asked her to not crow about me making 107 on the test while everyone is groaning about their own score as all it does it cause huge social backlash for me.  On a later test, she threw out my score as an outlier when curving the grade.  When the entire class pointed (accusingly) to me as obviously the person who got the 94 that she geared the test to, she and I were both able to say honestly ""nope"".  In another instance (different class, different instructor), I was able to point out that two of the questions on the test either had never been covered in class or were unanswerable because of the way they were structured.<p>Yet in both cases, the entire class was quick to be angry with or blaming towards me rather than the professor for how the grading system worked.  Why?  Because they have been told that since they were five years old:  'Don't blame me.  I would love to curve the grade more but I can't because of Mr./Ms. Smartypants over there.""  So I think there are huge inherent problems in making students responsible for the outcomes of other students in the class while adults not only shirk their own responsibilities but scapegoat one of their students.<p>On the other hand, I find that fostering an environment where everyone's contribution is genuinely valued and all individuals are genuinely treated with respect can help create a vigorous environment of open intellectual exchange that helps raise the bar for all involved, in part by setting aside pecking order, chest-beating and other ills of typical social interactions.  Perhaps that is akin to what the classes in Finland are achieving.

I don't care what DNS server people are using (we also support PowerDNS, and we also get questions about djbdns, even though we don't support it).  These are the mistakes people make, regardless...and it's due to fundamental misunderstandings of how DNS does what it does, and rarely has anything to do with syntax (most of the people I interact with are using Webmin, which hides the configuration file entirely, and so the semi-colons and dots are irrelevant because Webmin always gets them right; and Webmin can also automatically manage PTRs).",1256091406

There's just not that much demand from OEMs for swappable commodity phone hardware. So in a situation where hardware doesn't matter as much, Apple wins by controlling the entire platform and user experience. I think this will probably change, as we are starting to see, now that phone manufacturers can get a smartphone operating system for free.",1256091273

One particular example was a user who had over a million files in one directory. This caused all our backup software to fail.

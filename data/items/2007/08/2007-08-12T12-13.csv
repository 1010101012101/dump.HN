41662,comment,41565,41643,0,0,lkozma,,,"What you say is true for comments, I agree that every contribution should be judged on its own merit. For filtering/ordering submissions though, such as on the reco-page on reddit, a web of trust is quite natural. Since we have limited time, we can't possibly read everything, so we might as well prefer content from people we trust. Same thing in real life, when you read the next book of your favorite author, instead of one by a complete stranger. If the scores are distributed, the authority figures aren't necessarily the same for everyone.",1186922775

This information is used in order to decrease the weight of votes in the system for this <i>bad users</i>.<p>Our experience is that while this works very well against spam it does not stop the quality degradation that happens every time the community gets larger because the most active users tend to become friends and stop voting the news just for their quality.",1186922111

I read about it all the time, but that's because I read slashdot, digg, reddit and other sites that most people don't read. <p>Even people studying computer science don't know about Gmail and has to be told that there is an alternative mail service. I bet that most of Facebook's users don't use Gmail or don't see the point when they have Hotmail.",1186921967
41659,comment,41595,41619,0,0,ks,,,"I agree. The ""threat"" from Google is highly overrated. Gmail didn't kill their competitors. Nerds use it, but most users still uses Hotmail or Yahoo mail. <p>The same can be said for ""Froogle"". This is a search engine from the world's most popular search engine company, but their competitors are still very much alive (and provides a better product).<p>Youtube was far more popular Google's alternative video service, so they forced Google to buy them<p>If you have an idea you shouldn't worry about Google. The real threat comes when Google buys one of your better competitors, then you might begin to worry.",1186921422

I am more than willing to look into competing products and chose them over Google if they are better.<p>A lot of people will choose the competition simply because the competition to Google is the underdog, and people often sympathize with the underdog.",1186920745

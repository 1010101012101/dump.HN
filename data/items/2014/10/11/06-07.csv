I assumed you are smart and I said so.<p>I didn&#x27;t come up with &quot;blood running down the streets&quot; politicians were actually saying such things back then to try to justify their position against raising the speed limit from 55 to 65.  I don&#x27;t know the true motivation behind them making such claims.  My best guess is that the Federal Government exerted pressure by means of threatening to remove funding or some such thing.  Pure conjecture on my part at this point.<p>My point is that plenty of people are mercilessly voting my comments down yet nobody is taking the time to learn a little history and research what I am saying.  I don&#x27;t need to because I was there and remember the idiocy of the entire thing.  For about a year or so media outlets tried their best to push the &quot;speed kills&quot; and &quot;65 is bad&quot; agenda but reality somehow chose to defy them.  Blood did not run dow the highway as politicians predicted.  Not even close. And so after about a year or so they all stopped talking about it because everyone realized what the politicians were pushing was nonsense.  We actually had less accidents with the increase in speed limit.<p>Anyhow, as i said elsewhere, HN is a cargo cult club.  If i had come here fully aligned with the crowd and proclaimed how 10 foot wide lanes would save lives I&#x27;d collect a bunch of little votes and make all of you happy.  Instead an asshole who dares to not be in line with y&#x27;all and for that I am personna non gratta.  And that&#x27;s sad.  This isn&#x27;t a place where opposing points of view are welcome at all.<p>I get it.  I haven&#x27;t been reading HN for probably a year.  Now I remmber why I stopped.",1413010796

It mattered not even if the enemy was still alive, so long as you were alive at the conclusion. So in the Eighth Tournament, someone came up with the screwball idea that maybe they shouldn&#x27;t bother even fighting at all unless they came under attack from their enemy. Either it was amazing coincidence or there was an active conspiracy of communication going on that I was unaware of to build these horrible things, because a few more of these guys showed up at once than coincidence would seem to warrant in the Eighth Tournament.</i><p><i>&quot;I refer to this bunch as the Alliance because that&#x27;s essentially what it is. The robots agree not to fight each other so that each gets full credit for all of their battles. When Allied Pacifist Scum are in battle with each other, both get 100% points for their battles. If they fought it out, each would get 50% if they were equally matched, and both might well get less than that, since a double kill doesn&#x27;t benefit either one of them.&quot;</i>",1413010206

8441492,comment,8438063,8441476,0,0,rxin,,,"Yes absolutely. If I can get a single machine with 200TB of SSDs, that&#x27;d have been great :)<p>But as soon as we have more than 1 node, then having more nodes is better. We can actually demonstrate this quantitatively. We are required to replicate the output, which means 100 TB of data would generate 100 TB of network for replication, and 100 * (N-1)/N TB of network for shuffle, where N = num nodes. That is the overall 200 - 100/N in network. Assuming each node has 1GB/s network, then you&#x27;d need (200 - 100/N) / N seconds just to transfer the data across network, i.e. the optimal number of nodes is the one that gives you the lowest (200/N - 100/N^2).<p>The problem is with last year&#x27;s MR run was that it wasn&#x27;t saturating the network at all. It had roughly 1.5GB/s/node HDDs, and the overall network throughput was probably around 20MB/s/node when they were using 10Gbps network (I&#x27;m assuming only half of the time is doing network. If they were doing network the full time, then network throughput was at ~10MB/s/node).<p>Had we been using the same HDDs last year&#x27;s entry had, our map phase would slow down by about 2x, and the reduce phase shouldn&#x27;t change. This would mean a total run time of less than 30 mins on ~200 nodes. Still way better.",1413009886

Care about creating a safer car driving environment, but care even much more about your loved ones surviving traffic in good health.<p>In addition to lowering mortality/car-distance, one can reduce traffic mortality/population in two significant ways: shifting traffic from car to safer means of transport, and lowering total car-distance. This holds true both on individual and society level.<p>I&#x27;m going to deliberately provocate now by comparing to a very sensitive number. Just hoping it will wake up at least someone.<p>Improve road infrastructure safety to Dutch standards? Prevent over four 9/11&#x27;s per year (12850 deaths).<p>Improve transportation culture to Dutch standards?

8441452,comment,8439977,8441321,0,0,Ma8ee,,,"The problem with the expanded freeways is that they create traffic. People that previously used public transportation now take the car because it&#x27;s just faster. Then other people take that job on the other side of the city, or buy the house further out in the suburbs because the new lanes makes driving faster (for a while).<p>Of course it is good for the economy that people can commute effectively. But by building more lanes we are choosing spread out cities dominated by highways where no one wants to live and instead drive to work from the suburbs.<p>And there are alternatives. We can choose more densely populated cities where the streets are dominated by pedestrians and people commute shorter distances mostly by public transport. Much better for the environment, and most importantly, better for people.<p>And we are making that choice whenever we chose between using the land for new roads or using the land for new pedestrian buildings and railways.",1413008079

The problem is that the legal argument that the server was protected under the 4th was made poorly by the defense, and their arguments against the Feds. haven&#x27;t been very strong.  Perhaps there will be more time for the Feds. to ...clarify... their story of how they managed to get the IP, and if it&#x27;s shown that they used illegal means then that evidence should be dismissed.  So far the defense has looked as amateur as Ulricht&#x27;s PHP programming, but we&#x27;ll see.  Their claim that since Ulricht wasn&#x27;t actually engaging in the transactions personally, that he wasn&#x27;t involved in a conspiracy made them look like they were, um, morons.  There&#x27;s even a chance that the Feds. can convict with the many other pieces evidence that they have that isn&#x27;t hit by the Fruit of the poisonous tree (esp. in the pending case filed against Ulbricht in Maryland).<p>I&#x27;d like to see justice served on all fronts, with the Feds. nailed for their wrongdoings, and people like Ulbricht nailed as well.",1413007294

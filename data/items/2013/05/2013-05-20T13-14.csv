5737724,comment,5734480,5734953,5,0,benjamincburns,,,"> This is enough to put a smile on my face. There is something wonderful about skepticism and cynicism being proven wrong, especially when the skepticism is my own.<p>Mathematicians have always amused me with their weird way of turning their craft upon themselves. There's an astonishing amount of work done (I assume by procrastinating PhD candidates) on the statistics of performance in mathematics. Mathematics is supposed to be such a ""pure"" science, but this work seems to be motivated by insecurity and a base of other negative emotions. The skepticism it breeds isn't at all useful or beneficial for the field; if anything it's destructive, but yet it seems to persist.<p>Malcolm Gladwell wrote a great piece for The New Yorker [1] on late vs early bloomers in the art world. Gladwell writes that early bloomers are often driven by a sort of internal energy, and since they haven't taken time to refine their process they tend to be more abstract or conceptual. Late bloomers, he suggests, tend to take years or decades honing their craft. They're extreme perfectionists who, instead of working on building a piece, tend to work on refining the skills they need to build a piece.<p>In Gladwell's model for genius, Zhang is obviously the latter.  I think as a society we'd benefit from celebrating the successes (and even the failures) of ""late-bloomers"" like Zhang a lot more. Maybe it would promote the kinds of intrinsic motivation which would encourage more brilliant people to continue their struggle.<p>All of that said, the thing that brings a smile to <i>my</i> face is the fact that Zhang didn't come from one of the MITs, Harvards, Stanfords, or Cornells of the world. He came from a ""lowly"" state school. Here's hoping he stays there.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/20/081020fa_fact_gladwell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/20/081020fa_fact_...</a>",1369058397

Current exchange technology is not scalable past something like 50 operations per second, because of blocking issues. Using something like LMAX (which is used by betfair), you're probably able to get something like 1,000 operations per second. It's still in beta, but it can be out of beta if you can dig into coffeescript.<p>LMAX seems ideal because if something goes wrong, you can switch machines, load up the transaction history, and get going again in minutes.<p>Current stock exchanges may not be a great place to look, as they track thousands of individual stocks. A bitcoin exchange is different, as it's more akin to a stock exchange where there's only 1 stock and multiple currencies.<p><a href=""http://buttercoin.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buttercoin.net/</a><p><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html</a>",1369058382

I believe he is suggesting there are other methods which are more effective, less costly, and meet current societal goals. Remember that prison is partly about punishment, but to society, we just want productive people who do stuff that falls into the category of pro-social behaviors.<p>>The suggestion that the threat of imprisonment does not act as a deterrent to criminal activity is absurd.
I think that this point cannot really be proven anyway, so I will let it lie.<p>>Do you really not see ""I'm here because I screwed up. I probably should try to not screw up in the future."" going through the mind of prisoners as they sit in their cells?
Maybe? Who cares? The actual thing I am interested in is recidivism, and according to pew:<p>About 43 percent of prisoners who were let out in 2004 were sent back to prison by 2007, either for a new crime or violating the conditions of their release, the study found. That number was down from 45 percent during a similar period beginning in 1999.<p>So we are sitting at 43% re-offend AFTER going to prison... looks like our system works!",1369058326

The only acceptable things in my opinion are:<p>* using clean urls, for ease of typing/reading/sharing<p>* using proper semantic html tags to structure content. I don't really know if search engines look for them but having content neatly structured will help people get the most of a website (especially people with disabilities; screen readers and other accessibility enhancing software)<p>2. Penguin update... what about other search engines? Shouldn't a SEO ""guru"" tackle other search engines as well? What if google ""dies"" tomorrow? I know it's very unlikely, but as programmers we strive to cover all possible issues/scenarios/errors.. why don't SEO ""gurus"" do the same?<p>I'm sorry if I come across as offensive but I really don't understand this hype regarding SEO, and more importantly why clients chuck their money towards something that in my opinion is superfluous.<p>Also, how would you quantify the success of a SEO campaign, how do you differentiate from traffic/sales/success generated by the content of your website and the one generated by a SEO campaign?

Just because there's a new CEO doesn't mean the kind of change that needs to happen will happen (and conversely, it's wrong to lay all the blame at Meyer's feet if things don't turn out well).<p>Case in point, look at how badly JCPenney fared after Apple retail exec, Ron Johnson, became CEO for just 17 months:
<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/business/ron-johnson-out-as-jc-penney-chief.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/business/ron-johnson-out-a...</a><p>The fact that Yahoo can lay down $1.1 billion in cash is a show of how <i>big</i> the company is. That is both an asset and a liability, when it comes to the existing corporate power struggle.<p>edit: I'll give an example of which I'm familiar with, as a user: Flickr. I joined Flickr after Yahoo acquired it and have been a happy, <i>paying</i> user for nearly 4 years. However, I'd be at a loss to count all the new drastic feature additions that have come in all that time:<p>1. A new mobile app (which I don't use)<p>2. a nicer horizontal-masonry-like gallery layout...which, flabbergastingly, only applies to some collections of photos and not others<p>3. HTML5 uploader<p>And yet still, I count myself as a happy Flickr user, which means that prior to Yahoo's acquisition, Flickr was a great service to begin with. From what I can tell, as a data-minded person, Yahoo has done very little with all the interesting data that comes in these voluntarily organized and submitted photos. I don't get much help with auto-tagging or auto-grouping of collections. The Flickr logged-in homepage is nothing but a short list of the last few people who ""favorited"" a photo...there's been almost nothing  done in <i>four years</i> to get me to engage more with the Flickr network.<p>And Flickr's domain covers items of a very discrete nature...easier to do interesting analysis and data-operations on than I feel one could do with Tumblr.<p>So while Flickr's relative stagnation is not Meyer's fault...the fact that we can say, ""Well, it's not her fault that Flickr is meh five years in a row"" goes to show you how massive a company Yahoo is and how hard it is for everything to move/change even when a new CEO comes in.",1369057112

The issue isn't that people are keeping it quiet; it is that no one who can do anything about it cares or has the political will to change it.  Essentially, everyone knows and no one cares.  The fact that prison rape jokes are common and acceptable fodder for comedians in the US shows our society's lack of any form of empathy for prisoners.<p>The complaints that Weev has are the same complaints that prisoners in the federal system have had for decades. Prisoner treatment in the US has been litigated to death with no significant reform.  Courts have made explicitly clear that current law effectively allows for barbaric treatment of inmates.  Given the virtual impossibility of changing the status quo in the US political system, it is doubtful that our laws will be changed to upgrade the experience of criminals (which is how the cynical US public views such proposals).<p>So, when it comes to our unyielding government, I suppose every US citizen is an abused child.  It is a bully that will not ever go away, and can and does abuse anyone it wants to without consequence.

In Haskell, AFAIK, that's hard.  In Scala, it just requires copying your code over and over again, but it's possible and you can even share some of the code.<p>The other solution I'm thinking of in Scala (that doesn't involve Option[T].get, I mean) is to treat the properties I want ""proven"" as a set of methods over the data, built as a separate object or trait similar to how Scala represents type-class dictionaries.  I can then write <i>one</i> data-structure that quantifies over the type of the proof-witness dictionary it stores as part of itself.<p>So when, for example, I want a fully-instantiated AST with no remaining ""holes"" to be filled in by static checking, I could write a function that only works on AST[FullyInstantiated].  Functions that don't care about the proof-witness are quantified over it.<p>It then takes a bunch of extra typing to <i>construct</i> the proof-witness instances, but when I'm doing that construction I will have the compiler statically checking that all types relied on by the witness are correct.",1369055844

A week ? Fat chance. Would such an attack stop the cyber attack ? Probably not. Disconnect from the internet ? Not an option for any trade-based nation, plus also unlikely to stop the cyber attacks.<p>First lesson in international law - there is no international law, because the actors involved are sovereign and only prolonged warfare can -sometimes- dislodge them, at massive cost. So open violations of international treaties, even on large scale, are let go without consequences. Say, for example, something between legal discrimination (at minimum denial of religious freedom, article 2 UNHR) and religious genocide is happening in most/all muslim countries (with countries like Morocco and Turkey ""merely"" discriminating and Sudan, Pakistan and Bangladesh regularly being accused of large-scale state-sponsored religious genocide). And it's not like most of those countries are even a real military threat.<p>For China the question may be simpler, of course. It is certainly, shall we say, ""absorbing"" a few of it's neighbors. Again, what are you going to do ?",1369055055

It's in an early beta stage but I think that the focus of the site will cater to your needs. The way the reputation system works is that everyone starts from zero and builds up proficiency scores for each of their skills (e.g Node.js, Python but also Translation, Proofreading, Graphic Design, etc) based on the feedback they get for their work on relevant gigs. The site then proposes users to gig posters based on their proficiency levels and the poster's budget.  You can start work on low-paying gigs working for entrepreneurs or individuals and work your way up to better-paying gigs for larger clients. If you get average/poor ratings in the beginning (along with constructive feedback) but keep improving and get better ratings gradually, the more recent ratings will carry more weight in your proficiency scores so you won't be penalized for using your first low-paying gigs to try your hand at new technologies. I'm talking to the first clients at the moment but I am hoping to ramp up pretty fast. It would be great to get your feedback if you have time to check it out!",1369054956

Yahoo is mostly a pretty stagnant company that needs new ideas and ways of thinking and doing business. Tumblr offers that opportunity - making the central point of interaction a user-defined dashboard rather than an overly-programmed portal that fewer and fewer people visit out of inertia.<p>Sure, let Tumblr be Tumblr so you don't scare off its audience. But unless Yahoo itself becomes more like Tumblr, what's the use of spending $1.1 billion?",1369054912

For better or for worse, the fate of the company is tied directly to the actions of Marissa Mayer now, this is no longer 1999 and Yahoo is no longer the same company.<p>They have this image (which they rightly deserve) of being a big, bumbling ancient Behemoth of a company which provides no real use or purpose to the internet, but this could well be part of a bigger revitalization.<p>Cutting off the fat of the company, bringing in new properties <i>with the intention of keeping them alive</i>, changing the company dynamics to make it a better place to work, bringing in more talent and having a much more youthful outlook on things... These are all good things.<p>It remains to be seen whether or not Yahoo can perform this transition but things look good for them, if they stick to their guns and simply improve Tumblr without lowering its value to the community, I can see a real future for Yahoo, one where it isn't just irrelevant, but where it makes it's <i>own</i> products and creates <i>new and exciting</i> applications.<p>What I really want to see, is whether Yahoo is capable of making the move to generation XI and what it brings to the table now it's finally left the time warp it was stuck in.",1369054896

They differ with the person and they differ with the personal situation at the time. This notion that there is <i>The One True Sleep Pattern</i> and that everybody should adhere to it is not tenable in my opinion. It's a strategy that sells books on how to become ""normal"", nothing else.<p>I'm a night person, I viscerally hate mornings, and when I can I ""oversleep"" until 10 or even 11 in the morning. I go to bed when I'm tired, I usually sleep well and wake up rested in the morning. Sometimes I get tired during the day and when I can I respond to that by napping for a little while. In the absence of outside disruption, this works fine. I feel great and productive. On average I sleep 7-8 hours total, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's still possible to do a standard 7-to-5 workday, but after a while of doing that I simply become less productive and I start hating my day.<p>I've been told, directly and indirectly through ""sleep experts"" in the media, that my natural pattern is unhealthy and I <i>must</i> take steps to align myself with the same standardized day that is working so well for everybody else. Waking up feeling like you just got steamrolled, traffic jams, morning grumpiness, and being in the office before the boss arrives. Fuck that.",1367953197

5670016,comment,5667911,5669159,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The conclusions are based on the idea that higher speeds create external costs to third parties which aren't required to be internalized by the driver, making the driver more likely to choose a higher speed than would otherwise be optimal.<p>Which means the conclusion is wrong. The solution is not to have a lower speed limit, it's to require the internalization of externalized costs: Impose a fuel tax that accounts for the full cost of the pollution created to society. Require drivers whose speed has caused a collision to pay higher insurance premiums. Then drivers will have to weigh the cost to others in their decisions and the identified problem goes away.",1367953167

5670014,comment,5668567,5668567,2,0,dvt,,,"This comment may get a significant number of downvotes, but here I go. I think there has been an increasing number of these types of posts on HN -- especially in the past couple of years (for some reason). Having a good attitude when faced with rejection is great. I'm not a fatalist in the sense that I would encourage anyone to jump off a bridge if they get rejected by YC.<p>HOWEVER, it's important to understand the role that rejection plays. And it's also important to understand the baggage that rejection carries with it. Sort of blowing off rejection - to me - seems utterly stupid. Especially if it's something you <i>want</i>. The point of founding a start-up is to be successful (whether that's an exit strategy, positive growth, getting into YC, etc. is irrelevant). Failure/rejection loses all of its beneficial characteristics if all you do is blow it off (""oh it's just another notch""). You need to ask yourself:<p>1. Why did I fail?<p>2. What can I do to not fail again?<p>In some cases (1) will simply be bad luck. Consider an athlete that slips and tears his achilles or consider me asking a pretty girl out that happens to have a boyfriend. Oh well -- that's just bad luck. However, if the athlete in question failed to train hard or I made a bad joke that completely irked a girl I'm interested in, that's something <i>completely</i> different. I truly believe that the start-up world is, in many ways, a lottery. By that I mean that not only do you need to be in tip-top shape, but you also need to get pretty damn lucky to end up like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.<p>Blowing off failure prevents any positive improvements (hey maybe I should've trained harder, maybe that was a bad joke, etc.) and encourages a kind of isolated entrepreneurship where you think you know best and you're convinced you're doing your best (even though you may not be).<p>Also, lets face it: failure sucks. Being rejected by a cute girl/guy sucks. Not being accepted into YC sucks. Not getting into your school of choice sucks. I think that downplaying the suckiness of these events is not the way to go. Instead, figure out how to get what you want next time. It's a careful balancing act. On one hand, you don't want to be a fatalist that gives up after the first failure; but on the other, you don't want to be a hard-headed and obnoxious positivist that doesn't acknowledge failure when it's staring them in the face.",1367953136

5670009,comment,5669474,5669474,3,0,crayola,,,"PhD in economics here from a top 15 uni, completed a couple of years ago. No regrets, even though I realized, after a few years, that I would probably not enjoy a career as an economist (in academia or policy). I successfully 'converted' into data science. Most of my cohort found jobs they love. Some, though, had to settle for post-docs (sometimes for terrible pay) and are still in academic limbo.<p>There is always the question of the opportunity cost, of the road not taken. What would I have done of those 5/6 years? Perhaps I would have learned more, perhaps not. Many PhD students who end up outside of academia may have made better use of those years. I think the bottomline is, for every PhD, that you should only start it if you are passionate about the field and would like to work as a researcher (in academia or, say, IMF / World Bank). That may no longer be the case at the end of the PhD, but it probably should be at the start.",1367953114

I feel very sorry for my poor roommate, but I don't know any other way to wake up.  Luckily, I'll have my own room next year.<p>In fact, when I'm on break I tend to gravitate to a very weird sleep schedule where I stay up until about 7am and sleep until 3-5pm.<p>It seems to stem from the fact that when I go to bed at night around 11pm/midnight, I'm never tired.  I just seem to be pulled toward staying up late and sleeping throughout the day.  This used to keep me from getting much sleep at all, and it was drastically affecting my day to day mood and life.  Melatonin has become a life-saver in this respect, but I worry about if it has any side effects or if I depend on it too much.  It does allow me to be tired and fall asleep when I want to, which is WAY nicer than the alternative.  I used to just lie in bed for hours before falling asleep.  I wasn't on my phone or reading or doing anything productive with this time.  I was just agonizingly waiting to get some sleep.",1367952984

5669984,comment,5669474,5669917,6,0,zissou,,,"The underlying reason I think most DSGE models are absolute hogwash is that they do economics backwards. Economics is supposed to test theories against data. Instead, in the world of calibration in macroeconomic models, the creator of the model is now testing data against theory by tuning parameters to values they think are good. It is completely backwards.<p>While I appreciate the attempt to make macroeconomics more computational, I believe DSGE goes about it in the wrong direction. In an ideal world, I'd like to see models like the Leontief Input/Output model come back to fruition. In Leontief's model (which is often given as an example in many undergrad linear algebra classes), the economy is divided into many sectors. Data is organized on each sector to estimate its influence on other sectors. In an age where data is so vast, I just don't understand how one can decide that building deeper macro theories is a good idea. We need better empirical models, not better theoretical models (we have enough of those).",1367952877

Not sort-by-name or sort-by-time, but sort-by-what-I-want.<p>For context, I drive to work, around 45 minutes each way. There's no-one in the passenger seat and there are very few places I could safely pull-over. Pushing buttons on the display while I'm driving is right out.<p>With Google Listen, new episodes start at the back of the queue. Often, there's one episode I want to move to the head of the queue. Sometimes, I won't be in the mood for the next episode in line so I'll shuffle something else ahead. Google Listen does this by showing a menu for each episode with a 'Move to the top of queue' option.<p>Once I'm happy with the next hour or so worth of stuff at the top of the queue, I hit play and drive off. As the first show finishes, its taken off the queue and the next episode I had queued up starts playing, all without any interaction.<p>The few alternative apps I downloaded did not offer this.<p>Some people reading this, I'm sure, are thinking ""He wants a playlist manager"". No. Create Playlist. Add episode to playlist. Play Playlist. Delete Playlist. No. Take those away.<p>All I want is a button on each episode labelled 'Move to the top of the queue'. That's it. If I have to perform some ritual every day to create a new playlist or whatever before I can get that button, I'm not going to be happy. Life is too short for pointless ritual.<p>So, follow-HN-peeps. Does anyone know of a good podcast catcher that works this way please?",1367952727

""Develop"" has this connotation in my mind of a slow, meandering, possibly goal-free path. You ""develop"" skills over time - are they ever fully developed? Also, you ""develop"" film (and its prints) which certainly takes time, but is also kind of a curated, artistic process. Although I do feel that, at times, I sculpt, craft and <i>develop</i> a bit of software, I do this with ideas that are not quite formed; goals which are unknown; a kind of ""I'll know it when I see it"" project.<p>I do ""architect"" systems. I have to decide on a backing store and the shape of the data in the store: RDBMS? KV Store? binary blob on disk? I have to decide on a communication method between the app and the data store: local, native API? Network socket using the store's client libs? HTTP CRUD? I have to consider the ways the user will use this app: touch? mouse? keyboard? does it need new gestures? ""hot keys"" or ""chording""? I'll admit the user interaction is a bit more art, but there's usually some kind of specification for it.<p>I do ""engineer"" systems. This feels more like implementation to me: I implement that data design; I implement the communication code (APIs don't plug themselves in to my project); I work around pitfalls and shortcomings continuously ...<p>I am an artist, a sculptor; I am an architect and engineer; I am a handy-person and problem solver.

Runkeeper claims 0.71 miles in 11:18 (I walk fast)  The banners/billboards and signs are back up for the spring.  70 degrees, light wind, sunny, near ideal weather.  The city picnic tables are out and about 20 people eating (maybe two per table and maybe 10 occupied tables) and maybe 10 in line across all the trucks.  Local time is just after lunch rush hour.\n1) Korean BBQ is dead, we went from like 4 trucks at the same time last fall to Zero.  Called it!  Hyper narrowcasting competition killed ALL of them off simultaneously, which is too bad because I like KBBQ when I make it at home.  A general lack of Asian food which is too bad, I really like that kind of stuff.\n2) Prices are now a bit lower, almost as low as brick -n- mortar locally.\n3) Cajun, meatballs, pitas, pizza by the slice (come on, that's the best you can do?), several southern style BBQ (the new KBBQ fad?), a burger place, a wings place, perhaps some I can't remember.  I believe there was one plain ole sandwich place.\n4) The themes seem to revolve around given a substance pick a container (meatballs) or given a container (pita, pizza slice dough, wings) pick a substance to put in/on it.\nSome anecdotes:\nEverything at the cajun place was $8 but don't know portion sizes which is probably why they were the only place without a line.  The wings place is slightly more expensive than BW3 two blocks away.  The burger place was priced about like Culvers.  The meatball place sold out and was closing up which I guess is good revenue news.  Generally speaking you could ""eat well"" for about $10.  Lots of ""our entree is only $8"" or so in big letters but a coke or some side dish is $2.  The local food selections remind me strongly of the local mall food court except somewhat fewer choices.  I found the roar and smell of multiple 2 KW gas electric generators to be remarkably unappealing, if there's one thing the city .gov could do, it would be provide electrical hookups.  No one sells snacks and dessert is rare.  Food Truck Tuesday is currently operating at about quarter capacity.  Only about half of one side of the road was occupied all in a bunch.  Lots of traffic from the office buildings to the trucks and back, so actual sales are probably higher than picnic table occupation would imply.<p>I believe a lot of fads and prices are driven by the food network food truck series.",1367952122

""Chattel"" is a widely used legal term for personal property; its used as an adjective with ""slavery"" to specify a particular kind of slavery (the one in which slaves are legally treated as chattel, which while its probably the most familiar kind to most people is not the only thing considered ""slavery""), but the term ""chattel"" itself isn't particularly associated with the slave trade.<p>More relevant, ""chattel currency"" is a term for things used as currency that are not legal tender (its not exactly <i>commonly</i> used because there isn't a lot of need to discuss that particular class of things.)<p>However, there is one place its pretty commonly used, and that's among the kind of conspiracy theorists (often goldbugs) who think (for example) that Federal Reserve banknotes aren't legal tender and are a scam to get you to surrender your ""real"" money (which these conspiracy theorists seem to think is still real legal tender) for ""chattel currency"".<p>Given that a not-insignificant number of those conspiracy theorists seem to have flipped from being goldbugs to ""bitbugs"", I wouldn't  be surprised if it was the use of the term ""chattel currency"" was <i>calculated</i>, but it certainly wasn't a slave trade reference.<p>> Some stats from Google search<p>Counting search results isn't a substitute for knowing what you are talking about. I'm actually surprised that ""chattel property"" (which is a redundancy) has that many results, but that doesn't change that ""chattel"" <i>means</i> personal property, and that its use to refer to that is the most common use.<p>It is also true that ""slavery"" is a common context in which ""chattel"" is used as a modifier, and that use -- because specific discussion of that form of slavery as a class is much more common than specific discussion of non-legal-tender currency as a class -- is vastly more common than reference to chattel slavery.<p>But that doesn't mean that ""chattel currency"" is a reference to chattel slavery, any more than the fact that ""green"" is far more frequently used as an adjective to modify ""eyes"" (""green eyes"" -> ""about 500,000,000 hits"") than ""grocer"" (""green grocer"" -> ""about 1,840,000 hits"") means that the phrase ""green grocer"" is a reference to ""green eyes"".",1367951746

Over time I've come up with ways to ensure I actually get up early enough for important events and don't sleep through alarms - not even 'i hit the snooze button' problems but just alarms literally not waking me up - whether it's by making alarms louder, setting 6 alarms spaced out 15 minutes apart (yes, really), or going without sleep if I have to wake up too soon (in practice I found that getting 3-4 hours of sleep consistently is impossible; I always sleep through the alarms).<p>Even with all that though, nothing really changed. If I go a week or so without setting alarms and just let my body wake up naturally after a night's sleep, I will naturally drift from waking up at say 6am to waking up at 11am. Sometimes I drift backwards, and find myself waking up in the dead of night at 4am and being completely awake. It's extremely valuable to be in a work environment where you can at least mitigate this by going in to work early some days and late others.<p>I also find that forcing yourself to adhere to a sleep schedule that doesn't feel natural can result in more fatigue, and I wonder if other people have the same experience. I tried doing an 'early' schedule at work a few times, waking up at about 6am and heading in to work early, and always found that I was completely exhausted by 5pm. Moving my waking time forward a few hours almost always alleviated the problem. Maybe it's something you get used to only after doing it for months at a time?",1367951684

I know there used to tons of cushy analyst jobs and world bank/IMF/UN positions that hired Econ PhDs. Not sure if the world has changed in this regard.<p>3) One of the things that make life easy for Econ PhDs is the lack of a publishing treadmill. In CS, if you don't get 3 [magic number alert!] papers at a decent conference, few respectable advisors let you graduate. In Econ, my understanding is that exceedingly few people publish a journal paper by the time they graduate (please don't argue about Econ grads that write conference papers ... Econ Journal papers are equivalent to CS Conference paper when it comes to metrics like credit). Many people can write a hundred pages that their advisor+committee is happy with. It takes an order of magnitude more effort to get 100 pages that make your advisor+committee happy and also three random reviewers in your field.<p>An important, ending thought: the reason I didn't pursue a career in Economics was that I didn't get to build stuff. This is how I get my kicks in life. A CS PhD isn't designed to make you a better builder but it often does! Frankly, my biggest problem is that I need to stop building and get into the higher-level business of managing others to build, and higher value algorithmic stuff.

Don't want or can't get an academic job? No problem, there are plenty of consulting/industry/government jobs to go around for economics PhDs.<p>I'm an economics PhD dropout (after 2nd year) from a top ~40 program. Unlike the authors school, my former PhD program did not have the prestige of his top 10-20 school. I left my program because I didn't have a research match with my professors. Now I'm a computer programmer at a top ~1-5 ranked school and I'm infinitely happier than I was in graduate school. I may eventually go back for a PhD, but it will most likely be in a business school rather than an economics department because I enjoy applied work more than theory.<p>The main ridiculousness in the current coursework taught in most economics PhD programs is the macro course (e.g. freshwater/Minnesota macro). DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) is just stupid. For the uninitiated, here is why DSGE exists and what it means: A while back there was this thing called the Lucas critique, which was the observation that the models used in microeconomics and macroeconomics are very dissimilar -- that is, micro models say 1 agent will make a certain decision, so why isn't it that all agents will make that decision? Macro theorists took this criticism way too seriously and decided that their models needed to have micro foundations, hence giving rise to the macro modeling technique known as DSGE. How does the typical/introductory DSGE model work? It goes something like this: at the beginning of time, everyone in the world meets in a parking lot. At the meeting, they decide on the price of all K goods in the economy at all T periods of time by assigning a present value to each good at each period of time. Once all the prices have been decided, the world starts. That is the gist of this model, but if you want to read more about how silly it is, look up the idea of a representative agent DSGE model.<p>Anyways, my point here is that depending on what you want to do with an economics PhD, it may or may not be a waste of time. For example, if you study micro and econometrics and emphasize in industrial organization + game theory + experimental, you will make a great candidate for a cushy research scientist job at one of the big tech companies. If you study macro, well, you'll make a good candidate for a job.... doing macroeconomics?<p>TL;DR If you're going to do economics, don't do macro.",1367951382

Slots are programmed, and I believe they are programmed to give the near-misses that the article talks about.<p>One pattern I noticed once is that after a few plays (5-20), I would often get a small win, sometimes more than what I'd played already. If I stayed on the machine, the next small win would be after I'd played those profits and a few more plays--I was losing money. But if I got up and switched machines after the small win (usually, but not always, with a small profit), I could get another small win on a different machine much quicker. Once I made about $20 on 25cent slots this way. Another time, I lost $5 trying and gave up. These 2 data points happened 5-10 years ago, I don't go to casinos often enough to claim to know anything.

(Not that there's anything wrong with that, as CEO <i>[corrective edit: as Executive Chairman]</i> part of his job is to promote the profitable interests of the corporation he heads.)<p>His stated agenda is to have real id mandated on the internet and eliminate anonymity. This benefits him which enables Google to make more money selling targeted ads where the target is known and identification is reliable, as well as reliably tracking people's private and personal interests and preferences, which is very valuable information which those in marketing, insurance claims, and security will all pay good money to have access to. It is an asset which can be sold and profited from, of interest to his business.<p>One problem that has been brought up with having mandated identification on the internet, the ""internet drivers license"" proposal, is that it can ruin kids lives since they may say a lot of dumb things.<p>So Schmidt heads this off with a proposal to have a global delete protocol, likely mandated by law that it be respected by various sites.<p>For delete to work though with a single button press, real id is necessity. No problem, everyone will have to have their net drivers license, all net accesses, views and posts tied into  unique personal identifier such as social insurance numbers, so it is a simple matter to allow for a one-time delete of all records associated with a given globally unique personal identifier upon receiving a request from a central authority, or required daily checking of a central delete authority.<p>Of course the current solution, of using anonymous aliases, makes a delete button unnecessary.

Both have strengths and weaknesses with very similar feature sets, although I personally prefer DRF, backed up by my choice to use it over Tastypie when starting a new project 2 months ago.<p>Tastypie has a rather monolithic structure (most of the logic is wrapped in a single resource object) that passes responsibility from function to function.  I find the code hard to read and mentally compartmentalize the various components.  It does a great job providing basic functionality out of the box, but as soon as you start to do anything complex you will find yourself repeatedly digging through Tastypie source code to track down behavior.  Tastypie approach to URLs is also rather limiting.<p>DRF uses Django class based views and generally follows Django's design patterns.  I find the code much easier to understand and more inline with the direction Django is heading.  The module class structure makes it much easier to build reusable components.  One downside with DRF is their permissions system, it has a rather large oversight for multiple object permissions.   DRF completely excludes the queryset from the permission decision which leads to some terrible workarounds (I'm not sure how you can make an informed permission decision on a set of objects without access to the set of objects themselves).<p>The documentation and community on both is rather strong, although there is more information on Tastypie as they've been around longer.  As a point of reference, Tastypie has ~750 questions on stackoverflow vs 153 for django-rest-framework.  Both are actively maintained, but Tastypie's design architecture handcuffs it's ability to move forward.<p>tl;dr; My $0.02 - Tastypie was the standard, DRF is becoming the standard.

But unless the process is very loosely tuned, such selections are rarely <i>driven</i> by those biases, When I started at Sun the 'top' of the engineering ladder was the title 'Distinguished Engineer' and I wanted to be one, and so to know what it took to be promoted to that role. Some of the best advice I got was that, that was the wrong question. The question was simply whether or not I <i>was</i> a Distinguished Engineer.<p>The subtle difference in phrasing aligns with whether or not the organization <i>recognizes</i> Distinguished Engineers or <i>appoints</i> Distinguished Engineers. Sun was very much the former and not the latter. It changed my whole perspective from trying to do something which got me promoted, to doing stuff that I was proud of, with the understanding that if that was something Sun considered worthy they would promote me, if not <i>it didn't matter.</i> I know, hard to believe it wouldn't matter but the place you have to be is you're true to your path and in some groups that will be recognized as awesome and in other groups it won't, but that is the group's problem, not your problem.<p>So in the YC selection process, perhaps it is more about recognizing teams that are building YC companies, than it is picking teams to be YC companies. I've never sat in on the discussion so I can't say but from what I've seen of the demo day presentations there is certainly some homogeneity in the ""vibe"" these companies give off.",1367950728

Yes some ideas and concepts are overly simplified - but one has to make shortcuts to reason. Mainstream economics provides reasoning, and the means to test if it works against real life data (econometrics) - that's much more than most social sciences.<p>I am saying that as someone who is deeply interested in the ""logical"" underpinnings for racism and sexism. I love complex things - mainly to understand how they works.<p>Here, if these behaviours were illogical and had a negative payoff in all cases, they may not have existed in the first place- or persisted. But they do. Why?<p>To the best of my current understanding, they are related to tribalism (as in parochialism). If you prefer, there is a nash equilibrium with cooperative and non cooperative behaviour.<p>The external characteristics of the agent are used by the other agents to guess whichever is more likely - being cooperative or not - and to play accordingly.<p>Basically, in both cases the external characteristic of an agent are used in a ""best guess"" function, which becomes self reinforcing, yet there seems to be more than self reinforcement, or these ideas would not be so prevalent. (So  the interesting theories about say how agriculture helped the development of modern sexism are then developed, and tested in regressions)<p>I find that very cool - at a ""theory of knowledge"" coolness level. Different paradigm coexist (because there are more than one explanation) so you can pick up your ""school"" (Chicago, Austrian) and see how well it works, ie test it against new concepts in an experimental way - like bitcoin and check its predictive power. That's challenging, especially when it is counterintuitive in your personal biais (ex: I'm so surprised Keynesian theory works well)<p>Anyway, should you care about avoiding taboo (omg the n word! run!) or should you understand why and how it works?<p>EDIT: They are not mutually exclusive, but when you study a concept, the taboo associated with it quickly goes away. Yet it remains in other persons, which makes it funny and interesting",1367949867

My suggestion for anyone wanting to learn economics is to learn it in undergrad and mix it with another discipline.<p>I am surprised Abnormal Returns picked up this link.",1367949791

Tell me why I'm wrong."", and they declined to do so (pleading the 5th). According to Popehat's coverage, that seems to leave him pretty free to stick with the initial inferences.<p>IANAL and all that.",1367949771

Thus, causing me login just to search old messages.<p>My only problem so far was the fact that I use Two-Factor Auth. Once I remembered this, there was no problem, haha. I just went and generated a new app specific password. But, I forgot, and failed three or four times trying to use my regular password. So no problem with the app. Maybe just adding a reminder to your support docs, or display a tip in the app after several failed attempts to help forgetful users like me. =)",1367949766

5669649,comment,5669504,5669504,27,0,Udo,,,"I worry that an initiative like this could potentially extend to laws where only large companies such as Google are allowed to store any public user data because only they can demonstrate reasonable compliance with deletion orders.<p>The complication here is non-obvious but real: Google has been pushing a hard link between online and offline personas to the point of absurdity sometimes. They are in a unique position to profit from a law that requires this kind of link. Compare that to, say, HN or even very small websites where no such policy exists and no such policy would even be realistically enforceable. How could HN verify the authenticity of a deletion order?<p>I don't think Google is as altruistic as Schmidt pretends here. They are in a great position to leverage their ToS in a way that would effectively outlaw smaller competitors. He is obviously not pushing a technological idea here, so it follows he must be lobbying for a legislative one.",1367949730

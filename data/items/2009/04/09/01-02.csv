553747,comment,553703,553703,0,0,mahmud,,,"I just skimmed through their manual[1], which by their admission is ""under redaction"" [2]. Here is what I read from the manual and the tutorial[3]:<p>The language looks like C++ in syntax, which means it should be readable to Java, JS and ActionScript programmers. This is specially true of the class-based OOP they implement, where a class definition lexically encloses all instance variables, except maybe for methods.<p>Nice seems to implement generic-function polymorphism, or multi-methods. Methods can be defined outside the class they act upon, but unlike C++ it doesn't use a scope resolution operator but dispatches on the argument type. [my suspicion is confirmed upon further reading].<p>It has parametric classes with the same exact ugly syntax of C++ templates.<p>It is strongly and _statically_ typed; the later making it less-nice for people like me.<p>Nice is apparently embedded in Java. But unlike Clojure, it doesn't target the JVM with its own compiler, but seems like a source-to-source translator to actual java code. You can cut and paste java code into the bodies of Nice methods!<p>It has enumerated types, aka enums.<p>They completely don't understand what ""variable argument functions"" mean. They confuse variable argument length, with optional arguments, with arguments with default values. (at this point I would have thought brushing against Lisp would be a prerequisite for designing programming languages; they betray the Alan Perlis quote in the opening of their manual.)<p>They have some assertion and design-by-contract constructs. The manual says their assertions are just like java's, and give a trite example of displaying an error message when an assertion fails (no hint of first-class conditions here, a la Common Lisp's.) On further reading, their asserts and contract stuff is strictly for ""dying""; no means to recover from conditions or how to return to a handling point up the call chain.<p>Their implementation of tuples just looks so horrible; again, would have thought a language designer would know at least one ML dialect, and see how tuples should be done.<p>The arrays are your usual algol arrays. Nothing about adjustable array with fill pointers, a la Common Lisp. Nothing about a type hierarchy that points to arrays being of a sequence type, for example, so you could use sequence operations like LENGTH, INDEX/NTH, SORT, FIND, etc. on various datatypes with the same interface (lists, tuples, arrays, vectors, etc. all satisfy a common denominator of sequence operations; they should be layered.)<p>Look, a masochist can only hurt himself for so long before reading the Nice Manual becomes unbearable. I might have reached my threshold :-P<p>[1] <a href=""http://nice.sourceforge.net/manual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nice.sourceforge.net/manual.html</a><p>[2] ibid<p>[3] <a href=""http://nice.sourceforge.net/language.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nice.sourceforge.net/language.html</a>",1239241024

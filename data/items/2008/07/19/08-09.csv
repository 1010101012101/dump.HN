No-one will buy my old ones at the price I want to sell, or either I want to keep them around as spares.<p>That number should go down over time though. Apple's lost me as a customer over this whole iPhone mess. Back to the PC I go if I can sell this Mac Pro (but I'll always keep an iMac ;-)) - as an aside, if anyone in the UK fancies buying an early 2008 Mac Pro with 30"" ACD, I'm all ears.",1216457603

250572,comment,250353,250353,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"They gave wins to gmail in some categories (like spam filtering) because it's better than out of the box Outlook. Fair, but irrelevant. You don't use Outlook out of the box.<p>I'll take Outlook with a Barracuda spam box over Gmail for spam filtering. It's Outlook's ability to be so customized that makes it worth it for me. (Plus mobile is very important, and until Android hits it has a huge lead there.)<p>They should have at least made extensibility a category.",1216457134
250571,comment,249908,250089,0,0,petercooper,,,"Your page is selling features, not benefits. Are you specifically aiming at a technical sort of user who understands exactly what a wiki is, or do you want to reach people who want to make decisions full-stop?<p>This is hardly a full rewrite since I really don't know what your product is. But just as a taster, your two key paragraphs could be simplified and made a lot punchier, like so:<p><i>Making group decisions is hard, with many opinions and choices to consider. With everyone talking at once, how can you make a decision?</i><p><i>Decisionero makes group decision making easy. A simple framework is provided within which to structure information and opinions, ensuring that your group acts with more insight than any one person. With a central store for information and opinions, misunderstandings can become a thing of the past.</i><p>I'd strongly suggest, however, putting together a list of both product features and benefits and then distil them into an easily scannable bullet-point list for your front page.<p>Oh, and you totally need a screenshot on there. Even a bad one beats nothing.",1216457111

250561,comment,249120,249448,0,0,petercooper,,,"I find it weird that they didn't edit the guy's note either. It's almost Borat-like in the way it lacks words like ""a"" in front of noun phrases or possessive pronouns. The guy probably does write like that, but it seems crude to just paste it up without editing when you know it'll sound weird. Or, has it been written in such a way as to make it /sound/ Eastern European and thus elicit sympathy?<p>Well, whatever, I hope it all works out for them, but please, MySQL, get some editors.",1216455539

250559,comment,250013,250136,0,0,tjmojo,,,"My experience with PyDev+Extensions/Eclipse: [1] got (great?) interactive debugging, [2] fairly smart code completion (works for most Django stuff, see below), [3] plus all the other Eclipse niceties: a decent HTML/CSS editor (with WST), SVN integration, Mylyn with trac integration (manage trac tickets from inside Eclipse: nice), etc.<p>I configured the Django source as another project in Eclipse and make it a dependency in all my Django-based PyDev projects. This makes it possible to click on a class or function name and directly jump to its definition/declaration/source. That's better than any documentation.<p>Maybe the reason this works for me is that I also got the PyDev extensions? Even if it's just to support the PyDev developer with some cash, there are a few additional features in the extension that definitely improve productivity; see <a href=""http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/</a>. I configured the integration with PyLint, which helps a lot with coding style, especially since I am--for all intents and purposes--a novice to Python (4+ months of working with it).<p>Here's my take on the whole <i>debugging Django</i> issue:<p>a) In my experience, only a small fraction of development time is spent debugging. With the proper code structure/patterns/unit testing, little debugging should be necessary. This may be a controversial statement, but that's how I see it. For all the normal development use cases, just running the Django development server with default settings is fine and one can still edit inside Eclipse and get automatic reload. I have used debugging mostly to discover the framework (and Python) itself and found it extremely insightful, but did not need the reload feature then. Discovery can also be done in the interactive console, though.<p>b) If there is indeed a need to have a rapid change-debug cycle, the keyboard shortcuts to start a debug configuration in Eclipse allow a quick stop/restart of the development server with the --noreload option. The request can be made with the test client provided by Django; see <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/testing/#the-test-client"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/testing/#the-test...</a>, so one keyboard shortcut gets you to your first break point, without even using the browser.<p>I know Eclipse is a bit on the heavy side. A few gigs of RAM and a dual-core CPU help. I also do a fair amount of cross-language development and like the Eclipse platform for the breath of available language and tool support. In the past, I've used it extensively for PHP development and of course Java.",1216455427

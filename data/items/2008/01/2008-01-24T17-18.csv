103610,comment,103500,103500,0,0,kcl,,,"This is a very long article, and it's founded on a false premise.<p>Compilers is not an important topic because there's nothing universal you can take out of it. Machine code as we know it is a pretty arbitrary construction. Register machines themselves are pretty arbitrary---they're just one way to make use of transistor circuitry. The conversion from C to machine code is not really worth remembering. It's true that this system forms the basis for all our computing, but like the nanoscale physics of semiconductors, it's not required knowledge for programmers. It's just a bag of rules...it's not even a bag of tricks.<p>If you work at Intel optimizing compilers, then maybe you need to know this stuff. If you never hunch down and program inline assembly, why do you care? You're too far from the bytecode to leverage compiler knowledge against performance, and in fact you'd probably be wasting your time to do so. Its workings operate below the required level of abstraction. Understand what's going on, but leave the details to someone else. I don't need to know how Firefox implements an HTML parser to render my webpage. I just need to know that it does so in a consistent way.<p>Compiler implementations are pretty arbitrary, and oftentimes they're filled with a lot of goofy stuff. We shouldn't still be carrying cruft like Please-Excuse-My-Dear-Aunt-Sally around in our languages---and this is half of what a compiler does. If there's anything beautiful to take out of a compilers class, it's that a compiler can compile itself. There---I've spoiled the ending, skip the course and take a theory class instead.",1201197559

If I thought a 3 month head start was the major competitive advantage for my team, I'd go find a day job.<p>If you think the stuff you write on that application (did someone call it a ""BLUEPRINT""?!) has anything but the most tenuous connection to what your software/strategy will look like in 3-6 months, you're smoking something.<p>The problem with secret ideas is that they are secret to your users, too.  We literally got onto TechCrunch with three speculative jpg mockups and barely a line of code...  We were buried with amazing feedback and ideas and fairly quickly became very smart about the market we were playing in.  We got offers to help.  The level of interest was incredibly motivating.<p>Startup geeks are passionate about THEIR ideas.  Not yours.  The risk that a great team is sitting around waiting for an idea is absolutely minuscule compared to the reward of exploring the market.",1201197277

103605,comment,103592,103592,0,0,cratuki,,,"I suspect Gates doesn't really understand what capitalism is. All of his fortune has been built on the back of legislative protection. And - specific to charity - I have several times noticed Microsoft gaining positive media for the 'charity' of giving away free software that costs it nothing to give, and which only has value in that form due to an arbitrary ruling from the relevant government.<p>Here are some good starting points for helping the world's poor:<p>1) End the practice of propping up corrupt foreign governments with aid<p>2) Stop subsidising first world farmers and thereby killing the markets for the second and third world (including flow-on effects coming from ludicrous things like ethanol subsidy)<p>3) Governments cease support for rent-seeking measures like copyright and patents.<p>4) Abolish government-enforced wage floors which subsidise the low income earners at the expense of the genuinely poor by preventing business from finding employment for them.<p>5) Don't make environmental policy until recorded facts genuinely point to a need for it.<p>Everywhere around us the invisible hand of the state is interfering in our lives through pork-barrelling schemes that benefit those close to power at the expense of the rest. The big lie is in the claim that we have now is capitalism. Even in the United States, what we first world countries have now is better referred to as 'mixed economies'. They have elements of capitalism but are some distance from actual capitalism.",1201197084

I once called up a friend around May and congratulated her for graduating.  She said, thanks, but proceeded to inform me that she graduated last year.  And that I had called last year to congratulate her too.<p>I was far too ambitious when trying to build it.  I wanted it to import my inbox and tell me things about friends without me having to explicitly write it down.  In addition, it'd be able to let me know who I was neglecting and compare it to who was doing the same to be based on their frequency of reply and timeliness of reply.  When doing PIM (personal info management) stuff, it's always far too easy to want to do too many things.  So hopefully, you guys don't go down that path and keep things tight.<p>Anyway, this thing isn't for everyone, and it depends on what your social network looks like and what your attitude towards relationships to people are.<p>If your social network is comparatively small (within dunbar's number), then it's easy to keep track of people you care about.  Our brains can personally keep track of the purported 150 people or so.<p>If your social network consists of mostly people that know each other, then you also wouldn't need it, since you'd get what's going on with your friends through hearsay and gossip.  And you can act on that information if need be (however inaccurate it might be).<p>However, if you know a large number of people who don't know each other, ie. lots of little groups of friends that don't know each other, then you'd have a use for something like this.  In addition, if the nature of your job/life requires you to have lots of little loose confederations, this is the sort of thing you might use.<p>whacked is right that people MAKE time for what/who's important in their lives.  However, I think the value of a CRM for your personal life is not for the people who's really important you that you'd remember with your brain, or for the people you meet once and don't really care about.  It's for the people that you like, but they are not in your daily lives that you wish to keep in better touch with.  In a way, it's trying to be a tool to expand the upper limit of the dunbar number for users.<p>Anyway, I found it a tough sell, as most people only have 2 minutes to spare at parties, and not half an hour.  I also did everything wrong from not releasing early to not simplifying and focusing the system.  I eventually moved on to work on another thing.  So good luck to ya'll and keep us updated on your progress.  Chaos, feel free to email me if you want to bounce stuff off of someone.",1201195316

I actually do disagree with your model of the world; I don&#x27;t think groups have interests as such, but that individuals have interests, many of which overlap <i>to some degree</i> with similarly situated people who could be said to be part of the same class.<p>The problem with the Marxist approach to theory (which arguably the fault of Marx&#x27;s followers as much as himself) is that it over-emphasizes class membership to the point of abrogating individuality. In theoretical discussions,t he experience of people whose experience is more nuanced or at odds with their apparent class status are often dismissed with the claim that the individual has a &#x27;false consciousness&#x27; of his or her own situation; While capitalistic (and implicitly, patriarchal) social models do aim to be self-sustaining by promulgating ideology about &#x27;the way things are&#x27; and domesticating or even commodifying dissent, the Marxist ideological system can be just as much of a straitjacket, which is one reason for the relatively recent rise of intersectionality theory, with women, ethnic minority groups, sexual minorities and so forth asserting their separate and distinct identities. This is a big reason that left politics seem so fragmented, because each new identity group often plays out similar social dynamics to the one that gave rise to it; so you could say that Marx identified working, middle, and upper economic classes, and that feminists later sought a distinct identity because Marxist theory described some of their issues but ignored a lot of others; in turn black feminists, lesbian feminists, and so on had to carve out their own identities because the main trunk of feminism seemed to be constructed out of white and heteronormative assumptions which ignored distinctly different aspects of their experiences, and so on. Intersectionality theory comes at things from the perspective that people can have membership in multiple classes and that the interests, assumptions, or structures of those classes don&#x27;t necessarily align neatly.In the context of this discussion, I&#x27;m saying that sex work is a lot more complex than just something that negatively affects women as a class, and to to simplify it into such is to marginalize quite a lot of people within the class of sex workers by saying that their experiences and perspectives are irrelevant and should be ignored.<p>I can&#x27;t tell whether you mean to reference blackface as just an example of a class issue or to draw an analogy with sex work. If the latter, I think it fails because blackface was about excluding capable performers from the white economic market for entertainment despite the demand for their output, whereas class-based objections to prostitution rest on the argument that any kind of commercial relations involving sexuality are fundamentally exploitative/oppressive and should be forbidden.",1425664233

I think most of my customers would be ok with some kind of commercial license that also provides them rights over the source itself. If GPL is a risk, I&#x27;d ditch it.

The PR benefit of hosting Snowden is short-lived; his profile will fade over time if he keeps his mouth shut. Eventually, when Russia wants to improve relations with the US, they will likely use Snowden as a bargaining chip. He&#x27;s not worth much to Russia, but the US wants him really bad. So they can use Snowden to extract something they want from the US (reduction in sanctions, for example) for relatively little cost to themselves. But there was always very little downside to Russia here, and a significant amount of upside: right now, the upside is in holding Snowden up as an example of US hypocrisy, but later that upside might be that he can be traded for something more valuable.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to single out Russia as a bad actor here -- the US behaved in a very similar fashion with Soviet spies and dissidents in the 70s and 80s.

9158270,comment,9156348,9157266,0,0,netcan,,,"To date, there are 2 and a quarter business models for TV. One and a half is ads. half is paid subscription and the remaining quarter is split between DVD sales, PPV, product placement and such. People are just not going to pay enough in large enough number to compete with advertising. The stuff they do pay for is generally better quality, so I don&#x27;t want to knock it, but it isn&#x27;t enough to cover the 23.5 hours per day that we consume.<p>Paid/subscription has the internet going for. Hulu/Netflix/etc. can operate without (much) infrastructure. But there are (IMO) real pathologies in the economy that we are seeing play out. A nice UI is a plus, but not a long term strategic advantage. The long term strategic advantage is exclusive content. That&#x27;s great in the sense that it competitively promotes high quality shows. But, it also turns services into silos. People subscribed to Netflix, Premier League and BlubbyTV still don&#x27;t get Game of Thrones&#x27; newest season because HBO.TV need an 8 month exclusion period to sell <i>their</i> $7.99 subscription.<p>Exclusivity is a waste. TV shows are noncompetitive goods. In the age of torrents, it&#x27;s also a cause of instability.<p>Back to ads… A lot of what is bad about TV advertising is based on the old FMCG advertising model. Since they&#x27;re shown to everyone in a region, they can only sell tampons, cereal, cars, bank accounts, washing powder… products that everyone uses. Products most people care about very little. Branding for mature products where all options are near identical is that dull repetition thing. It takes 100s of views per uninterested person to make sure people remember that Coca Cola is THE real coke.<p>OTOH, ultra-targeted ads while worrying and creepy from the privacy perspective, are much more relevant. Relevant usually means less annoying. More importantly, it doesn&#x27;t require that much repetition or overall airtime to do the work. With ideal targeting, a 10 second preroll ad (ad plays before the show starts), banners on pause and other minimal ads can achieve more than 4 X 3 minute ad breaks on regular TV.<p>This ties into the competitive environment that Netflix-like service compete in. Ads suck and people will switch to itunes, DVDs or torrents. That will help keep them honest and minimize the space/time they can have. Internet streaming has more room for competition. Services will compete on user friendliness and that means there will be a lot of pressure not to annoy people with ads. In fact, minimizing obtrusiveness and maximizing revenues will be the main competitive pressure. Too little revenue and the shows will opt out of your service, too much and subscribers will switch to another service. 10X better than the pathological cable market.<p>On the business model/economics side of things, ad revenue is better than subscription at distributing the loot. Shows can get a portion of ad revenue for <i>their</i> views, hopefully the lion&#x27;s share. This gives shows an incentive to increase viewership across all platforms. Exclusivity can go away. All content can be available everywhere. just make the best show to win.<p>Shows won&#x27;t need to go around trying to cut exclusive deals. It will be in their interest to be on all platforms. For a platform to buy exclusivity, they will need to beat the potential ad revenue earned on all the other platforms, a high bar for any show worth pursuing.<p>Overall, I think that an ad-based TV economy will have the best effect on the complex as a whole. Ads will reward shows that are successful across all on-demand platforms and that will encourage the types of high quality binge-watchable shows that I think are finally rivaling novels from a story, character and art perspective.<p>Outliers will still have the option of purchasing shows on itunes and stuff like that. If they are really a decent market, some of the streaming services might offer ad free options at a higher price. But, I think sufficient competition (no reason there shouldn&#x27;t be) will arrive at a result with more revenue, less overhead and a lot less airtime dedicated to ads.<p>^The giant mammoth in the living room is privacy. I think it&#x27;ll be 10 years before we&#x27;ve worked this one out. I haven&#x27;t gone into it because I don&#x27;t know what I think.",1425663275

They might not actually know the rules, he added, but they think they do, which amounts to the same thing. As a &quot;business guy,&quot; he said, he is always trying to simplify the &quot;pitch&quot; - the GPL tells everyone &quot;what we&#x27;re about,&quot; so it has the greatest impact.</i><p>[0] We did this when we wanted to publish a royalty-free patent license tied to certain code, and wanted to be sure it would not keep people from using that code in GPLv3 projects.

Without knowing much about your particular situation, in general I would encourage you to find a way to do so, particularly if your major is in a field with &quot;hard&quot; employability benefits (i.e. not &quot;studies&quot;). Of course there are exceptions where brilliant people didn&#x27;t complete their education and achieved great success in business, but it&#x27;s a huge gamble. Essentially the situation looks like trading long-term benefits for short-term ones. My advice would be for you to talk to your family and friends about this to reach a decision. They probably can help you in unexpected ways.",1425661734

True, not all large resources are as innocent, and there is no real way around encrypting and not caching everything if you don&#x27;t want devices on the network to tell the difference... but the result is just so pathological.

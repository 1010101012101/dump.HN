6665751,comment,6665182,6665682,3,0,mkramlich,,,"Also I&#x27;ve seen a pretty high correlation (not 100%, but high) with clients that push down on pay... but ALSO have very high expectations on quality and time-to-market. It seems paradoxical, but life doesn&#x27;t prevent paradoxical idiocy from existing.<p>Speaking in general terms, the clients that offer/agree to higher pay tend to be less demanding, more flexible, more realistic, more appreciative and with more repeating/recurring business (rather than one-off speculative &quot;I have this great idea, just need a duh-veloper!&quot; situations)<p>I&#x27;m getting very close to a point where I might start &quot;shit testing&quot; or filtering potential clients by asking for, say, $1000 upfront, just to have an exploratory talk with me on the phone. Figuring that if they cannot even do that, physically, or are not willing to do that, then they are probably not the kind of client I want to take on anyway, either because they don&#x27;t have the budget, or, are not sophisticated enough. (They don&#x27;t understand market conditions, the risks involved to developers, the money cost of time, the time cost of money, the nature of reciprocity, or what their alternative cost would be if they had to hire a software engineer as a FT/direct employee, pay full benefits, paid time off, insurance, etc.)",1383523180

But I bid to a very specific spec, and what can seem like a tiny change often goes against the grain of assumptions built into the code and is anything but tiny.  To a person, clients agree then whine down the road when guess what, that change is a price increase.  Sigh.

A lot of things you will do on Ubuntu are specific to Ubuntu systems, and even more so with distros like RHEL and Gentoo.  Then you have oddities like GoboLinux.<p>It&#x27;s one of the oldest sayings in the community that &quot;if you know Slackware, you know Linux&quot;.

Slackware is as &quot;raw Linux&quot; as it gets, but due to frustrations with recent versions, I switched to Arch and haven&#x27;t looked back for my Linux systems.  It makes administration much simpler without having to do much that&#x27;s specific to the distro and different from what you should expect in Linux.<p>That isn&#x27;t something even remotely true about Ubuntu -- and apparently getting less so as time goes on.<p>tl;dr: what I&#x27;m trying to say here is that there are users and there are administrators.

If there isn&#x27;t a cmdlet, then you can usually get the job done but you need to roll up your sleeves and do some coding (or searching/downloading).<p>This is not that different than Unix BUT because so much of Unix is done using ASCII text files, the coding is really manipulating text files which can be done easily by admins.  Windows is an API-oriented OS (vs a document-oriented one) which means that the coding looks much more like programming than in Unix.<p>The solution is to have the cmdlets you need.  We are making great progress on that front but the reality is that Unix has about a 30 year head start so it will take us a while.  In  V2 we had ~240 cmdlets and in V3 we had ~2,400 cmdlets.  (Sadly, ZIP/UNZIP are not among them).  We added more in V4 and are extending our focus (from IT pros) to devops with features like Desired State Configuration.  That is very much of a minimal viable product but I think we got it basically right and there is a lot of energy around this.<p>I appreciate the criticisms  and encourage you do continue making them and don&#x27;t hold back - we really do read these and use them to make the product better.  Politeness is optional but we would really appreciate specificity (like you provided here).<p>Please let us know other things that we should be adding, doing differently or stop doing.<p>Thanks!<p>Jeffrey Snover [MSFT]\nDistinguished Engineer and Lead Architect for Windows Server and System Center",1383521159

My great-great grandfather carved wonderful sculptures during winter time.<p>2) healthy food is bullshit. Only valid number under that conditions is energy content. The more fat the better.

Forget it, your family would loose significant part of income.<p>Lovely part is taxation. If I would send invoice for webdesign for 1000 euro, I would only make 280 euro profit. VAT, income tax, and compulsory social and health insurance would eat most of it.<p>And the absolute worst part is that everyone has to pay social and health insurance (60euro per month).

In the case of the Booth paper, I really should state I do not mean to attack him. The idea of using the KMP preprocess to solve the problem is a wonderful approach and works very well despite the actual implementation being technically incorrect. If I recall, the bug had to do with the termination condition; the algorithm had to run twice as long to terminate correctly. I will say my understanding of the algorithm improved as a result of debugging it!",1383519828

But you should not fill your life with just one activity.<p>You should be networking, talking, going out, learning, traveling and filling your life with a wide variety of things. Yet the start up programmer lifestyle is programming 24/7. It&#x27;s not healthy. I can guarantee you a lot of start up founders, don&#x27;t work the hours their programmers do.",1383519805

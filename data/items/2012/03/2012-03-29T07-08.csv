1) Install in App Store 
2) Still not actually installed, start it, that finished the installation 
3) You still don't have what you need, find where they've moved ""install command line tools"" to and install that
4)The compiler you have isn't the right one as Lion no longer has GCC as its default compiler and you want to use RVM 
5) ......<p>Once you've done it a few times it's not that hard and you get used to knowing where to look for problems but the first few times it can easily be half a day lost just trying to get the environment working.",1333007935

In any case, if you're looking for an open platform try a Symbian or MeeGo. The Nokia N9 is one of the best smartphones ever made and, if you can get it, you will have a real user experience. Also, if you're a mobile developer who is not into BDSM you will be happy to hear that you don't have to write your programs in Java, although if you really want to you probably can.<p>Symbian and MeeGo are also getting constant OS updates although Nokia's official direction has shifted away to Windows Phone, and will continue like that for several years.

3770170,comment,3769533,3769698,3,0,frio,,,"I strongly agree.  I've been averse to owning a tablet for a while; generally, I prefer to have a laptop: if I want to do work on it, I can.  I've recently tried a different approach: use the laptop (/tablet, now) for all my entertainment needs, and my desktop for work (in order to encourage myself to do more/better work on my desktop).<p>So, to facilitate that, I grabbed a cheap HP TouchPad, and flashed the (admittedly still reasonably raw) CM9 ICS build onto it.  ICS itself is pleasant: the notifications system is great, the multitasking is easily on par with WebOS, and the action bar is a good step forward.  The screen wasn't so great, but I knew that going in; most of the ""real"" Android tablets have beautiful hardware.<p>The state of the apps, however, is shocking.  Even Facebook and Twitter haven't bothered to build tablet apps.  I believe Google is somewhat stuck between a rock and a hard place here, however, and it boils down to an argument I've often thought entirely facetious - fragmentation.  While they introduced decent APIs in ICS for making apps that work well on both phones and tablets, the <i>vast</i> majority of phone hardware out there is still running Gingerbread or older.  Meaning that developers can't use those new ICS APIs, because their apps will no longer run on most user's devices.<p>I don't know how Google can address that easily, but I'd wager it proves to be a significant impediment to those trying to target Android tablets: either they do the whole thing manually in Gingerbread, or fork their codebase into an ICS version, and a Gingerbread version.  Neither is an overly pleasant solution.<p>(for the record, I ended up drooling over/buying an iPad 3.  The apps are much better)",1333006978

How many ""average"" customers are entirely satisfied with the smallest amount of customization the system allows?<p>I'm returning my new iPad this week because 1) My Macbook Air is light and more useful, I have no drawing ability, and I don't read much; the iPad is no more than a toy and waste of money in my ecosystem, and 2) The app store ecosystem is dreadfully boring on iOS. On Android I feel like I'm actually rewarding the good developers by buying their Pro versions of apps and such... on iOS everyone wants your money, regardless of how shitty the product is.  On Android, I see so many developers experimenting across so many categories just for the fun of it. 3) High-resolution has hardly benefitted anything that I do on the device. The majority of content that I see (images and video) are low-res. Plus, very few apps that I use have been upgraded to 'retina' quality. ALSO, retina doesn't just mean scaling everything up... why is nobody making their content more detailed? Orthogonal lines don't render that differently in higher resolution.",1333006605

I was thinking more like the dev can pay a fee to get his app reviewed (UI, performance, ...etc) and when ""approved"", it gets a symbol (check mark, star, whatever) and put on a category of ""approved"" apps.

I am assuming that the numbers do have meaning here.<p>Marketing names may or may not be intended to be short-lived. Sometimes, they just become short-lived, either because of how they behave in the market (see: Edsel), of internal politics (a new brand manager steps in; (s)he cannot claim the previous manager did a fine job, so something must change), or due to short-term profit hunting (""device named 'X' sells well! Let's make a low-budget one and sell even more!""-""But we would have to cut quality to make it cheaper""-""Yeah so?"")<p>There also seems to be this notion ""if consumers are confused, they will pick a brand at random. The more brands there are, the easier they get confused. I will make lots of brands, so that they will get confused, and pick a random brand. Since I have so many brands, chances are they will pick mine."". That approach leads to short-lived brand names.<p>As to that DX-3095 naming scheme: chances are that it was taken directly from the manufacturer's internal tracking system.

I've heard some stories about hrackers storing piles of cash under the couch [this case was in Ukraine], made from cracking banks/ATMs. Definitely, black activities are much more profitable. But I do not think that [in real life] those that crack get most of the money, with few exceptions. Biggest pile usually goes to those who organize or cover (underworld Board/CEO equivalent).<p>However, the start-up fever, which started in Russia appr. 1-1.5 years ago, is getting traction, as well as tech industry. This provides more opportunities and better risk/reward ratio and shall result in that more and more people will be moving to bright side.<p>And yep, the smart brain has no nationality.",1333004946

3770063,comment,3765717,3768042,1,0,batista,,,"><i>As an example, from their first post, they suggest that it's not legitimate to worry about this sort of problem because larger problems exist. This form of argument is not only blindly hypocritical (that is, if the arguer believed it, they would not be engaging in the subdebate but rather be working to resolve the larger problem)</i><p>Which I am. I have a somewhat popular blog in my language on the ""larger problems"", and am member of several political groups on those issues. I also comment on HN on larger issues, when the topic warrants it.<p>What strikes me as idiotic is seeing people blogging about the ""horrible problem of sexism"" (what's more with examples like some programming convention where some presenter has a scantily clad girl in the slides, or the ""that's what she said"" jokes, or some poster on some hackathon that mentioned pretty waitresses --i.e bs--), whereas the same people and blogs never seem to mention any problem of more importance.<p>><i>but intrinsically ridiculous -- it supposes that it's not legitimate to discuss any issue while ""worse"" problems persist.</i><p>If your house was on fire, it would be ridiculous to discuss the fading color of the fence or that you have to mow the lawn. Without priorities, discussing problems by itself is idiotic. This very notion of yours gave rise to the concept of ""first world problem"", I concept with which I fully agree.<p>><i>They then literally compare their own downvoting to the Salem witch trials (the irony of which is beyond belief, and further calls into question their sincerity)</i><p>I fail to see the irony. Is it because the victims of the witch trials were women, and I (according to your reading) said something against women? I thought the message from the Salem witch trials was: ""do not burn/beat/abuse/downvote people about how they conduct themselves and think"" (""[the first accused] <i>was described as not living a puritan lifestyle for she wore black clothing and odd costumes which was against the puritan code</i>"").<p>><i>and additionally claim that proportion of women in tech is ""not a serious issue in its manifestation or it's consequences at all""</i><p>Am I not allowed to think that? Or is it only that I'm not allowed to make that claim?<p>What are the serious repercussions of less women in tech? Are there also serious repercussions of less women in the myriads of jobs there are less women? Or of less men in the myriads of jobs where there are less men?<p>Most women are not fascinated with shiny blinking gadgets and Star Trek, so they don't tend to choose a career path with the same criteria as men. Women took the smart path and chose biology --where the future big money are--, instead of sweating it coding mongo clients in node.js for 14 hours a day to maybe win the startup lottery.<p>I'd be much more worried about people who WANT and CANT be in tech (like the homeless, the poor, etc), rather than people that have the option and chose not to.<p>You have this a-priory theory based on ideals (and not empirical evidence) that women must necessarily be equally inclined to select an IT BSc, so you have to blow things like ""sexism in IT"" out of proportion to justify it not being so. As if, men and women in high school applying for college already know how it is working in an IT shop or in a startup, and that it includes sexism.<p><i>>They also fall into a really standard ""I'm just expressing my opinion"" backtrack, which is particularly ironic given that their initial complaint was that people were expressing their opinion on this topic rather than doing something more worthwhile.</i><p>Now, my initial complaint was that people were expressing their opinion on this topic rather than EXPRESSING THEIR OPINION on something more worthwhile. But even if it was what you mention, I still fail to see the irony.<p>You could be right or wrong in doing so, but there's absolutely no irony in trying to get people to stop complaining about what you consider a non-issue and doing something more worthwhile instead. For, as you see it:<p>Complaining about non issue: no benefit to society.
Complaining about people complaining about non issue: the benefit of getting people back to real issues.<p><i>>Regardless of their viewpoint, they're not participating in reasonable intellectual discourse. We're not obligated to argue with someone who's plainly not interested in having an actual argument, and the up/down-voting is working as it should in this instance (I'm certainly not saying it works as it should in all instances, but this is pretty clear).</i><p>Actually you're just taking the easy way out and misread my arguments with prejudice. On top, it's you who are not interested in conversation. Noticed how ALL of your arguments are about my argumentation as argumentation (i.e meta) and NONE OF THEM is about my argumentation as substance? I.e you nitpick my argumentation style, but you never add a counter-claim. Probably because you already think what you believe on the matter to be some sort of immutable physical law.<p>That is, I gave several arguments, talked about nurture, statistical preferences for other fields, how (any) sexism in the workplace is not known to those applying for college IT, and still women are less there, etc. What have YOU counter-argued on the matter?",1333004805

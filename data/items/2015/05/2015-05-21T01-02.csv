Tools like the one presented here are content to invent detail that looks pleasing to the eye, but if you tried to do something like this for photographs you wouldn&#x27;t get anything that would hold up as evidence.

Using a different/easy-to-learn tool doesn&#x27;t reduce the complexity at hand. You will ultimately end up reinventing all the features in the easier tool, what was available out of the box in the original one.<p>This is precisely the problem with languages that make things easier for novices, once you are beyond that stage you will see yourself doing a lot of work to accomplish simple tasks. This is the reason I switched to Perl, from Python. Python was good for a month, once I started running into more complicated tasks, Perl starting emerging as the clear winner.",1432173529

9580558,comment,9579409,9579409,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"It was an interesting and different kind of article. I particularly loved his attack on companies&#x27; claims to democratize some function. I know there&#x27;s two meanings to the word but we&#x27;re better off using (verbally and as consumers) the more important one. They&#x27;re just cheapening the concept for profit.<p>The other thing I liked was how the author took ownership of the situation while expecting less at the same time. I had this experience using little-known and semi-custom OS&#x27;s for high security setups. The secure system lacked access to so much stuff. Yet, it had enough stuff on it to be useful and content-proxies were easy enough to build. I occasionally wanted a certain program, Youtube video, or whatever. Yet, my system did exactly what I designed it to do, nothing more and nothing less. And, like the author, I was happy with it rather than disappointed. It&#x27;s a strange, good feeling which I&#x27;m not sure most people experience while using their computers.<p>Of course, with KVM switch, I could always go right back to a full Windows/Linux system if I couldn&#x27;t resist the urge or needed to do something modern.

If cars are empty or people inside are engaged in a dopaminergic activity (working, texting, having sex, etc...) it will become less of an issue. Especially with electric cars as idling of the engine becomes non-issue. Add to that that currently amount of time my car on the road is limited by my time (and thus i plan/optimize when/where to go, like getting into store on the way from work, etc...), the self-driving car can go to store for pickup or deliver some papers, etc... while i&#x27;m doing something else. I.e.  the total sum of time of me getting quickly home from work and the car going to store on its own will be larger than one optimized trip - i.e. my time in the car would be lesser while car&#x27;s time on the road would be higher if everything else was equal. Though it willn&#x27;t be and thus- i&#x27;m looking forward for many productive hours stuck in &quot;smart & autonomous&quot; traffic trying to get home as quickly as possible and sending the car on whatever errands before and after - hope it will enjoy being stuck in traffic among the sames.",1432172840

A machine has pre-chewed and pre-digested your food into a neat package. Now the energy required to extract the maximum amount of value has been lowered significantly, so you wind up with more energy than you need. But it gets worse...<p>Glycaemic Index. When sugars/carbohydrates are slowly extracted from a thick matrix of cellulose, they&#x27;re delivered slowly but surely to your system. Highly processed foods have done away with most of the cellulose or at the very least broken it down significantly. Eating these processed foods you get what&#x27;s generally called a sugar <i>rush</i>. Your blood sugar spikes, insulin is released to deal with this incredible spike however the spike only lasts for a short period - now you&#x27;re having a sugar <i>crash</i>.<p>You lose your temper easily, you can&#x27;t think straight...you reach for another soda, burger or fries.

For example:<p>* Police are investigating a crime and have not made all details of the crime publicly known. Under questioning, a suspect independently corroborates these details, which he would not have known unless he was the perpetrator. The prosecution now has a stronger case.<p>* Three high-ranking members of ISIS are in fact CIA informants. They meet their CIA contact biweekly in a falafel shop in Mosul. The identities of the informants, their contact, and the falafel shop are all state secrets.<p>* A defense contractor is building a secret weapon that is decades ahead of competing powers. The design and specifications of this weapon are state secrets.<p>* The government maintains a health insurance system for the disabled, poor, and elderly.<p>* The military is performing operations somewhere in the world. Their exact order of battle and battle plan are secret.<p>* The military is planning an amphibious assault on Beachhead B. Using a ruse, they convince the enemy that they are instead landing at Beachhead A.<p>There are reasonable and good-intentioned debates to be had about state secrets, but to say there is never a legitimate purpose for them is the practical equivalent of anarchism.",1432170859

Speaking of functions, I prefer not to do argument arity checking on every single function I write(I'm looking at you too, perl!), or accidentally assigning global variables through a simple misspelling.

I know firefox still doesn't have it. Does v8 yet?<p>From what I've read, other Prototype-based languages treat Javascript as their ugly step cousin, and I would overall consider it a much inferior OO system to that found in Python, Ruby, CLOS, Perl's Moose, and PLT-Scheme, to name a few.<p>You can easily get rapid redeployment in any dynamic language. You can even get it on the JVM with Java, as the Play framework is showing us.

Technical thinking is lauded in a society where production is the dominant measurement of value. This contributes to bias towards a certain type of cerebral intelligence.<p>I actually just watched a TED talk on a related note, in which Ken Robinson discusses intelligence bias: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/ken_robinson_says_schools_...</a>",1275334597

Yes, there is some high initial investment in understanding poetry (in spoken language or programming language). And in return, you get a higher level of expressiveness. People look at the high level of investment, and say that the poetry isn't worth it, because they mistakenly think that it will require that level of investment every time. But like any language construct, once you really learn it, it becomes natural to you and doesn't require that high investment each time.<p>I wrote a Turing machine generator in arc once. To me, that was the prime example of the power and pitfalls of poetic language. At the time, I was practicing lisp like languages a lot, so it just flowed out off me. It was short and very powerful, and I could read through the dozen or so lines and see the equivalent logic expanding in my head. It would've taken many more lines of C++ or Python to get that logic working. Now that I'm out of practice, going back and reading it makes the whole thing seem completely inscrutable.

The main reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing. Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have people working on something like the natural history of computers-- studying the behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And then at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It's as if mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same department.</i><p>> <i>Sometimes what the hackers do is called 'software engineering,' but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.</i><p>I guess what I'd like to see exist is a ""Programming Arts"" degree. Or just a ""Hacking"" degree.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html</a>",1275332543

This was sort of encouraging, because it suggested that a lot of the urge was psychological, which seemed better than a relentless chemistry-driven compulsion I might never beat.<p>That's not to deny the physical addiction part, but to note that appreciating that it's not <i>all</i> physical addiction makes it seem less impossible to beat.<p>(I also noticed that the urge to smoke in the morning was greater after I had that first one.  I then started throwing any remaining cigs down the toilet before going to sleep.  <i>That</i> took will power. :) Sure, I would buy smokes on the way to work, or at lunch time, but it helped me cut down.  I must say, addiction sucks.)",1275332508

A coping mechanism, if you will, to live with relapses and so forth.<p>I know at least one Alcoholic who is totally dry now (and will not touch a drink because he is scared of slipping back) and yet another who is a normal drinker again. In the first case the guy is pretty like those in the AA - but his coping mechanism is to have scared himself from drinking (again, no issue there - if it works...). The final example, though, suggests that alcoholism is entirely fixable in at least some cases.<p>(note: I've had problems with slightly excessive/impulsive/habitual drinking in the fairly recent past, so some of this is from experience)",1275332489

1393187,comment,1392140,1393029,0,0,tumult,,,"Well, within your few sentences lies the method through which AA is able to remain a meme (in the original Dawkins sense). The core tenant is that alcoholism is a permanent 'spiritual' disease, that cannot be cured, and can only be treated through perpetual use of the 12-step program for the rest of their lives.<p>None of this, in reality, is based on science or facts. It is something that the original progenitors made up.<p>Because most people in their normal lives will not develop an addiction firsthand, and because most people are honest and basically believe what they are told (expecting other people to tell them the truth), this continues to propagate.<p>One way to tell if something propagates mostly as a meme rather than by functional merit is to cross cultural boundaries and look for it elsewhere. If it were something that had merit, there is a better chance for it to have grown within other cultures independently. AA's own self-published census shows that it is overwhelmingly an American and Canadian phenomenon, with some small sprinkling in the UK. It basically exists nowhere else in the world, except for expatriates from the US.<p>There is also a correlation between alcohol addiction and AA penetration. Places with more problems with alcohol addiction have more AA meetings. At first this seems to make sense -- more alcoholics, more AA members and meetings to help them. But if you go to places where AA does not exist at all, you'll find the same numbers you'd expect from America if there was no correlation with AA. In other words, places without AA have the same numbers you would get in America if you took the AA slider widget and turned it back down to 0.<p>My own conclusion is that AA and alcoholism is mostly a cultural artifact, not a physical (or 'spiritual') disease manifesting itself in people's bodies. I encourage you to dig up numbers (which AA openly provides from their own surveys, and are not flattering to themselves) and draw your own conclusions.",1275332421

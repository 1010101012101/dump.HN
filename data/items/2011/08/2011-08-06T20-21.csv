Needless to say, getting used to the workflow and proper way to do things when collaborating on a much larger scale is a bit difficult.  Is there anything out there that teaches you how to go about using git properly like an interactive tutorial?  I've been shuffling through the git book, but I learn much better by doing and I feel like if there isn't an interactive tutorial posing situations and teaching you the proper way to checkout, pull, rebase, commit, merge, etc then someone should work on creating it!

Creativity is essentially combining different ideas, and technology puts at your dispisal a constant stream of new ideas.  You can follow in great depth the ones that tickle you.<p>The majority of people will always passively consume.  That's nothing new; it's possibly a lot more visible now with a lot of content-free blogs/twitter/etc.<p>But for those so inclined, technology helps a lot.  For one example, look at how many free programming languages are available for use now -- things that you can build billion dollar businesses on.  It wasn't like that in 1985.

2854880,comment,2854680,2854680,10,0,georgieporgie,,,"I'm not too sure I agree with the specific notion that availability of distraction destroys creativity.  Here's my (off the top of my head) take on creativity:<p>Problems 1:  You come up with an idea, and tell yourself, ""that's a good idea, I should remember that!"" and then you <i>don't</i> remember, or you tell yourself that you need to focus on fixing these bugs at work, or on whatever other task is at hand.<p>Problem 2:  Your mental energy is sapped by whatever you're currently doing.  It's like the classic Stephen King quote about how working simple manual labor (laundry) was fantastic for creativity and writing.<p>The solution to problem one is to always have a means of taking notes, one which you will <i>definitely</i> revisit.  This frees you from wanting to focus off-task when you need to be on-task, and it allows you to revisit and refine your thoughts.  Problem two is tougher.  Find a job doing exactly what stimulates your creativity.  Let's face it, though, that's not as easy as blogs and Dice make it out to be.  The only advice I can give is to quit your job and do <i>exactly</i> what you feel like doing until you've found a problem you want to solve, but that's not a very constructive path.<p>I've found that by simply doing whatever I want each day, I'm exposed to way more interesting problems that I <i>want</i> to solve.  I listen to things like podcast while performing tedious, manual labor (cycling, weight lifting, cleaning, wrenching, etc), and I feel like it's both easier to get the tasks done, and I'm left with a feeling of better variety of mental exposure.  I'm currently experiencing a much more creative/inventive period in my life than I have in years.",1312663721

2854812,comment,2854187,2854187,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Tough question to answer, since economists don't fully understand economics yet either, and still get it wrong (how many professional economists besides Roubini foresaw and warned of the financial crisis again?).<p>Some of the most important bits of foundational knowledge I've accumulated over the years:<p>1.  The Industrial Revolution demonstrated to humanity that wealth could be created from thin air, on a large scale, and hence civilizations had an alternative to stealing it from each other.  There are basically two ways of creating wealth:<p>-1) Harvest raw materials, apply labor, capital, and innovation to convert them into finished products worth more than the sum of their parts.  The diff between what it cost to make the product and what you sell it for is the wealth you've created out of thin air (more commonly known as profit).  It's why manufacturing is important.<p>We used to take hundreds of dollars worth of wood and iron and turn it into thousands of dollars worth of sailing ships.  Now we take hundreds of millions of dollars worth of sand, aluminum, and copper and turn it billions of dollars worth of microchips.<p>-2) Provide a service that saves other people time and/or money.  Time & money = wealth.  With the time/money saved, they can either do more of #1 or #2, invest it, spend it in leisure, or whatever else is of value.  More commonly known as specialization.<p>Most things are combinations of the two - products that save time or money (web apps, cars, etc.), or services that reduce the cost of #1 or increase its final value.<p>2.  In a fiat currency system, the underlying of everything is interest rates, and the underlying of interest rates is the risk-free rate of return.  If you only watch one single data point, the risk-free rate is the most important.  When it moves, everything moves (since all other interest rates are indexed off of it).  Normally the risk-free rate is considered to be US Treasuries, but over the past few years there's been thought amongst some actuaries, economists, traders, etc. whether it's not something else, like a composite of US Treasuries and LIBOR, or something else.  But just be aware that there is a concept of a baseline interest rate upon which all other interest rates in the economy are indexed on, and even tiny movements in the baseline rate have major ramifications for the entire rest of the economy.<p>3.  Incentives matter.  One of the things that all economists across all schools of thought agree on.  One good article:  <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/what-weve-learned-incentives-still-matter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/what-weve-learn...</a>.  Plenty more if you google the phrase.<p>4.  Fractional reserve banking.  Many people misunderstand how this works, so I'll preface by saying that individual banks <i>cannot</i> create money.  Eg, an individual bank cannot loan out more than it has in deposits.  If a bank has $100 in deposits, and the Federal Reserve sets the reserve ratio at 10%, the bank must keep 10% in reserve, eg it cannot loan out more than $90 of its $100.  But, the banking <i>system</i> can essentially create money, or multiply it, based on the fractional reserve ratio and the money multiplier.  Wikipedia has a good table that demonstrates how this works:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier#Table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier#Table</a><p>4.  On a meta level, don't subscribe to one economic school or another, rather learn and understand them all, where and why they disagree, but don't get emotionally invested in any one of them.  I see lots of Austrians in this thread and a Keynesian or two.  Listen and understand, don't believe.  Economics is the study of one of the most complex, dynamic, and intractable systems we know of, and no school has it completely right yet, all are subject to further revision.<p>5.  In that vein, read Benoit Mandelbrot's <i>The (Mis)Behavior of Markets</i> for a good discourse on why economics is so difficult and intractable.  <a href=""http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/misbehavior_of_markets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/misbehavior_of_markets.html</a><p>6.  Also read Charlie Munger's Harvard Commencement speech, <i>""On the Psychology of Human Misjudgement""</i>, for a reminder of why not to get emotionally invested in one school of econ, or worldview, or religion for that matter.  <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=munger%20psychology%20of%20human%20misjudgment&kh=1&kg=p&kp=-1&kb=d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=munger%20psychology%20of%20human%2...</a><p>I can think of more, but that's enough for now, hope it helps a little.",1312661541

Social Security in theory funds itself, although Social Security's funds have been raided to fund other programs which now jeopardize its future.<p>Politicians will not address medical entitlements, because they will lose too many votes in doing so. Ultimately it's these medical entitlements that will bankrupt our country, and in the process, cause the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the U.S. - not from the rich to the poor, but from the young, to the old.<p>Most people who support medical entitlements do so for ""selfish"" reasons, in that they want those entitlements to be available for themselves, their family, and/or their friends. They say things like ""health care is a right,"" although it obviously is not a right. Health care is essentially the result of man's labor, and to say you have a right to health care, is to say you have a right to impose your needs on another man. Which of course is silly and inconsistent with the American constitution.<p>Still - people will assert their right to medical entitlements, and politicians will oblige, which in the long-run will pull money away from business investment (not all businesses are rich with billions in cash). The added financial burden will either stifle entrepreneurship and innovation, or it will send it oversees.<p>Of course, anyone who stands up against medical entitlements, like Paul Ryan, will be referred to as a villain who wants to murder old people.

There might be some value to what is essentially a form of dancing dressed up as combat, but take it into a ring, a cage or a pub brawl and the best you can hope for is that it is useless - most traditional arts are <i>actively harmful</i>.",1312661043

But, the rate he is charging other people is too high to us. He deserves that rate though. I know he would comprise and charge us a discounted rate, but I just feel a little bit bad that I could not pay a fair rate for him, and for other team members who have worked so hard for MinuteBox",1312661018

Something like this is implied to be happening towards the end of Stross's <i>Accelerando</i>, which I highly recommend (there's a free ebook edition).<p>However, note my use of the term ""god-like"". Anything capable of doing this is so close to being a god that it makes very little difference from our point of view. There's also the theory that our universe is a simulation run by such an entity - the argument is something like ""if it is possible to run a simulation of the universe, it is statistically far more likely that we're in such a simulation."" Sort of makes sense, if you have the right mind-set or tilt your head and squint.",1312660923

residents that Ronnie Callahan, who now owns the Fox store, was
hauling in large amounts of pseudofedrine from Mexico.He has log

supplying meth cookers, don't know if he was cooking the stuff
himself. No idea if he is doing this anymore, but is involved in all
kinds of underhanded dealings. <i>He constantly harasses, in very subtle
ways, one of his neighbors...builds fences to block off land that
isn't his. In the past no law enforcement would do anything about it
when she filed complaints.</i> He is worth watching at least.

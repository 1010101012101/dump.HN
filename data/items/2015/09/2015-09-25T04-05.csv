Currently the state of the art for such a battery is about 4.7 MJ/kg and the theoretical maximum is as high as 28.8 MJ/kg, at which point the mass of the turbopumps and other fuel handling parts might make up the difference.<p>Of course there are issues, primarily the fact that they&#x27;re not rechargeable and have to be chemically recycled. It&#x27;s currently too expensive to do that now, but once we can do it economically, each airport will just have to have a stock of batteries and a robot to swap them on the jet and we&#x27;ll have electric flight.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium–air_battery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium–air_battery</a>",1443157129

If Apple served the same encrypted blob to everyone, then the encryption would be completely useless as everyone could decrypt it.</i><p>I used to think this as well. However, (my memory is fuzzy on this so take it with a grain of salt) a year ago I downloaded the same app from two different iTunes accounts. Both encrypted apps were identical, and had the same encrypted blob. So it seems Apple is not distributing a unique encrypted blob to each user, at least as far as apps are concerned.",1443157052

Anyone know how feasible it will be to control it?<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/glowforge-series-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/glowforge-series-a/</a><p><i>How defensible is Glowforge’s laser cutting tech? Shapiro says the key innovation the team has come up with is moving a large number of functions out of the hardware itself and into the cloud. “We have ripped out huge amounts of hardware from the machine — from a typical laser design, and replaced those with software that we run in cloud servers instead of running locally,” he explains.<p>One example is the motion controller board used on many traditional laser cutters to translate whatever line the person wants cutting or engraving into a series of electrical pulses that choreograph the motor. Instead of using that type of component, which Shapiro says starts at $400, or even using a cheaper alternative controller like an Arduino, the Glowforge uses cloud software to do the grunt work. “We simply send down the ones and zeros for the motor to the machine over the internet which reduces the cost by a factor of 100,” he notes.<p>“The thing that’s relatively easy to clone is the hardware, although we have some interesting innovations and patents there, but the place where we think we can really add a great deal of value is in the software,” he adds.</i>",1443156938

If there are internet outages, or the company goes out of business, the device will no longer function as a laser cutter.<p>The firmware is a very small piece of the puzzle.  The cloud service is being portrayed as doing all of the heavy lifting.  That&#x27;s image processing, CAM, toolpath creation, and motion optimization/lookahead.  Once the motion is optimized so that the motion system will move as fast as possible within its acceleration limits, the result is a list of explicit instructions for the motion system and laser.  Accelerate at rate A for T seconds.  After X steps, pulse the laser at a power level of P.<p>Thus, the firmware simply processes these instructions, and actuates the motors and lasers.  That&#x27;s not to say the firmware is trivial.  But in comparison to the overall codebase, it is a very small chunk of the complete CNC system.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that Glowforge is under any obligation to open source anything.  But this is a fairly small concession that does not address the main concern that most people have voiced, the inability to run the complete system on your local machine.",1443156762

10276402,comment,10275963,10275963,0,0,jeffeharper,,,"This synopsis of Michael Wolff&#x27;s book is so far off the mark, it seems Mr. Weisberg missed the point.  I found the book to be far more nuanced, intelligent and provocative than the Mr. Weisberg would have you believe.  And I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s heavily invested in the idea that the eponymous Internet, in terms of the battle royale mentioned in the headline of this post, will win.  Of course, when it&#x27;s put that way, I think Michael Wolff would agree.<p>The &quot;Television&quot; Wolff refers to is the business, not the device.  Or as Wolff states:<p>&quot;TV the business model derives revenue from content pushed through a distribution network also called &#x27;TV.&#x27; The health of the distribution channel is a vastly different issue from the health of the businesses using it.<p>&quot;Of all the bets to make, perhaps the least safe one--and the bet underpinning digital&#x27;s hopes of grabbing a meaningful piece of television&#x27;s revenues--is that people will stop watching TV, even if they stop watching THE TV.&quot;<p>What Wolff is addressing is the argument that YouTube and Facebook could kill the industry creating &quot;professionally made, scripted narratives.&quot;  His argument is that YouTube and Facebook&#x27;s business models are essentially selling advertising and nothing attracts advertising dollars nearly as well as high quality, professionally produced content.  User generated content, on the other hand, will never have the same value to advertisers in large part because there is just too much of it.  If YouTube and Facebook want to grab a piece of TV&#x27;s revenues, then they need to get in the Television business--or more precisely, in the business of creating exclusive professional, scripted narrative content.  In doing so, they&#x27;ll help fund the existing institution consisting of writers, directors, producers and actors that are currently in the Television business.<p>Michael Wolff sees cord-cutters dropping cable television in favor of Netflix as proof rather than an anomaly.  &quot;Digital Convergence,&quot; Wolff states, &quot;turns out not so much to be about bringing computing to your television but about bringing more television to your television.&quot;  After all, when Netflix needed a break-through television series in a competitive landscape that was becoming increasingly commoditized, they turned to well known and well established Hollywood talent in the form of David Fincher and Kevin Spacey.  Netflix, a tech company, became a traditional stodgy television company.<p>Wolff&#x27;s ideas around bundling are incredibly provocative and worthy of discussion.  To him, the current iteration of cable bundling is inevitably doomed.  And what will replace it?  Different, more efficient, more transparent bundles.  After all, aren&#x27;t Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO Go and Sling their own forms of a bundle?<p>Regarding the cable companies, they of course own the high speed connections necessary to receive the new form of Television.  It turns out that they will be just fine as well.<p>Bottom line, Television is the New Television is a challenging read.  You&#x27;d be wrong to dismiss it for being the same old story where the horse has already left the barn.  If you can digest the nuance and complexity of his argument, I think you&#x27;d agree it&#x27;s a little ahead of it&#x27;s time even if it sounds at first like anything but.",1443156334

I have nothing but praise for the latest software and this is coming from someone who couldn&#x27;t use his Rift since around November last year when the AMD drivers and the Rift&#x27;s extended mode stopped working together.<p>Basically now the Rift is considered a proper HMD as a category of its&#x27; own and not a bastardized monitor.  There is no more extended mode.  Everything compiled with Oculus SDK 0.6.0.0 and above now works in Direct Mode only.  The latency is noticeably better.  With the latest AMD/Nvidia drivers, you just plug the headset in and there&#x27;s no monitor-type configuration at all.<p>Note this is with Windows 10; I don&#x27;t have first-hand experience with 8.1 but think it&#x27;d be much the same.  It really is that much better.<p>Also, if you haven&#x27;t checked out the latest VR Desktop (<a href=""http://www.vrdesktop.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vrdesktop.net</a>), you need to do this too.  In addition to giving you a giant screen to see your desktop on, you can now play full-screen games in it, watch YouTube 360 videos properly in it and watch 3D movies encoded in side-by-side or top/bottom encoding.  It&#x27;s really really awesome :)",1443154077

1286606,comment,1284266,1285473,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Indeed. and you make a good point about cars, that being that if one actively shows the thing off in public one is inviting scrutiny. I would have no problem at all with a story along the lines of 'Man spotted in bar photographing self with iPhone - new model must have front-facing camera'. For that matter I'd be OK with 'iPhone prototype found? Man finds functional iPhone, but exterior case looks fake (obvious exterior facts)'.<p>But suppose, to stick with the car example, the driver of a prototype car parked in a public lot and then dropped the keys, or was careless enough to leave them in the ignition. Would it be legitimate for someone to drive away and then sell it to a car fansite so they could pop the hood and partially disassemble it? There's a <i>large</i> qualitative difference between passive observation and active taking into possession. And I don't think opening the case is a proper means of evaluating a lost item, especially not when one has already ascertained the identity of the owner (by recognizing him from his facebook page, where he was easily contactable).<p>Thanks for taking the time to flesh out your argument. I was hoping you'd refer me to the statute for industrial espionage, by the way, because I think you might be surprised at its scope and specificity. Would you like to, or shall I?",1271973559

While I am happy to edit my xorg.conf file because ubuntu doesn't recognize certain graphics card/monitor combinations, my mother would not.\nMy office laptop was recently upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7.  The background colors and overall theme changed.  After a few days, I didn't notice it any more, nor was there a HN post about the color scheme change.\nWhat I did notice was that offline folders worked a lot better than with XP.

It seems like clicks don't quite register, etc.  I do not have an iPhone though so I may just have to get used to it.<p>- The soft texture of the touch screen is disconcerting, but I may end up getting used to this too.<p>- Verizon 3G should be much faster and more reliable than my TMobile 2.5G.<p>The Bad:<p>- It's not a Nexus One.  I'm sort of over this but not quite.<p>- Even though I signed in with google, there are two email apps, two calendar apps, etc... One is the google app and one is the ""standard"" one.  How can I delete the non google ones?<p>- The droid form factor is a bit clunky, about 2x as clunky as my blackberry 8900 and in spite of this the phone feels fragile.<p>- UI is slightly sluggish compared to an iPhone 3G or Nexus One.<p>The Test:<p>1) Will I give up my $60 per month unlimited voice/data service with T-Mobile and switch to Verizon and continue using this phone after the 30 day free trial?<p>2) Will I find the phone so compelling that I build an app for it?  So far my experience with the android SDK has been shock at how long it takes the simulator to boot (which I think needs to be done every time you want to test a fresh build of your app).  Fortunately the phone itself boots much faster.",1271970370

Although he didn't use cheats, SC3000 was the best cuz it had a cheat where you could place a specific building and have it be there permanently--without any worry of abandonment. SimCity 4 is much harder because there are a lot more variables to deal with, including the fact that you can run multiple cities in a region.",1271970311

The details of the optimization are often surprising.  Even the specific choice of factors to optimize for are interesting.  In SimCity, one player shoots for maximum population; another might go for the quickest time to reach a particular population level; yet another might seek to maximize industrial production.  I like seeing how they work within the rules to reach those different goals.",1271970298

Someone in the position you describe seems to be at a point where their own perception of their qualification, based on the fact that they did somehow get a degree, is inflated compared to their qualifications as perceived by potential employers.<p>""Overqualification"" is a strange term anyway. It's not that a potential employer wouldn't want someone better than strictly necessary for a job.

The temptation to roll over existing changes when inheriting a new codebase can be overwhelming at times, and the only sensible way that I've found to deal with it is to consider the impact to the schedule and how that ties into the overarching business need for whatever it is that you're working on.

Memory architecture matters a LOT, and much of CPU area is devoted to cache and memory infrastructure. In a GPU, my understanding is every ~32 cores share a small cache and MMU, which makes some SIMD operations / algorithms more challenging to implement. Good for some algorithms, not so great for others.<p>I think the whole focus on ""cores"" misses lots of issues. Memory infrastructure is only one. Instruction-level parallelism (superscalar & out-of-order) execution is another - even single-core processors like ye olde Pentium can execute multiple instructions per cycle. It's very easy and tempting to look at the number of cores and use that as a rough estimate of system performance. But this approach will land you WAY off of real-world figures. It's akin to using the number of cylinders in a car's engine to determine how fast it is - sure, to the first order, cylinder count is correlated with engine output and hence car speed, but it's only a very rough correlation.",1354376251

Capital costs are high but, like renewables, amortized over a long lifetime with low operational costs. Your wiki link puts nuclear cheaper than solar or offshore wind, and barely more expensive than onshore wind.<p>Moving to small modular reactors, as many outfits are trying to do, will lower the required investment and time to production. Liquid thorium or fast uranium would largely eliminate long-term storage problem...in fact, we'd eliminate the long-lived wastes we have right now. (In the meantime we should keep wastes in a form we can use for fuel later.)<p>Renewables are great as far as they go, but there are only so many places you can build a good dam, and wind needs either a large oversupply, an economical energy storage system (which, other than the limited hydro, doesn't exist), a drastically souped-up and expensive power grid, or possibly all three. You don't have to worry about that if you're just adding power on the margins, but you do if you want to run civilization carbon-free. Taking all that into account, it's questionable whether wind would really be cheaper, especially as we're forced to expand into less suitable locations.",1354376082

He made a prediction-- that the amount of hardware parallelism we'd have would be between 16 and 256-- and it didn't really turn out to be true.  I would say that we now have something like between 8 and 12 way parallelism on most systems.  If you take a 6-core i7 with hyperthreading, that's 12-way parallelism.<p>Talking about specialty hardware like the Xeon Phi HPC accelerator (which most developers have never heard of, let alone programmed for), just doesn't make sense.  Similarly, GPUs may be ubiquitous, but how many programmers have actually written for them?  Very few.<p>The reality is that CPU architects have done everything they possibly can to keep down the amount of parallelism.  When you get transistors, you can use them for things like L1 cache, instead of adding more execution units.<p>The bottom line is that it's hard to predict the future.  We can read stuff from the past, like mailing list posts about how Linux is irrelevant because ""we'll all be using Sparcs in a few years,"" but the lesson that it's hard to make predictions never really seems to sink in.<p>I hope that we'll see more manycore chips in the future for developers to play with.

It turns out that only about 2% of the people killed in Pakistan by drones are high-level terrorists, and collateral damage including women and children is a extremely common. Furthermore, ""double-strike"" standard operating procedure specifically targets first responders by hitting a target a second time minutes or hours after the first strike. The whole thing is pretty sick and based on the accounts in the report, drone activities terrorize the population as simply being near a terrorist (or someone profiled as a terrorist based on their behavior) can get you killed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://livingunderdrones.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livingunderdrones.org/</a>",1354375671

Wind and hydro power are already cheaper, for example. On top of that, whilst any new nuclear power plant will take many years to produce, costs for renewables continue to fall, and, it obviously has a huge number of risks (not just 'meltdown' but costs, security, long-term storage etc). Off the top of my head i think a wind farm is also more energy dense than a nuclear power plant, given all the space required around it.<p>That is not to say it is 'baaad' because it does have some uses; eg it can provide a baseline power. Basically, we need many different sources, but there are (more?) informed people who oppose nuclear for very good reasons.<p>OTOH thorium could be great, but it has not been proven commercially yet.

The idea is micropayments, but the twist is that you pay after you accumulate 5, rather than paying into a 'wallet' up front.<p>We have a couple of positions open for python developers, and as we are still very small, those positions have a lot of scope for responsibility and choosing your own focus. We have a lot of Django work, so there's also a possibility to join as a Django specialist, especially if you also grok HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Other technologies we use include Tornado, Cassandra, Redis, and our code lives on github. Experience with these is a bonus but not necessary!<p>If you are interested, drop us an email with a resume and some code to look at - jobs@laterpay.net",1354374442

4857789,comment,4857463,4857463,1,0,jokull,,,"Right on. This is related to ""the big rewrite"" that kills a lot of projects. Time and usage makes code value go up. Even if its written in an old framework that you wouldnt use today, uses urllib instead of requests. Just ignore the urge and move on (for now).<p>Ive recently worked on an old project (www.oath.is), dusted it and launched it as an app. It was a Django project and my urge was to rewrite the whole thing so I could use SQLAlchemy and Flask which I had picked up in the meantime. On the frontend I immediately wanted to rewrite everything in CoffeeScript and Backbone.js. But I resisted it and managed to spend my time adding features, a new design and unit tests and launched in like a week. After launching I had some extra time to rewrite the jQuery-spagetthi, which paved the way for some more advanced client side features without becoming a horrible mess. So I guess you have to make that decision multiple times over the lifetime of a project. But yes, holding off the urge is a good practise.",1354374110

That mail will be scanned by Google - applying the technology they honed from scanning books, and possibly also the technology they purchased with re-captcha.  So now you've got mail in digital form, which they'll make available to you online for review - with the option to have things you want handled in-person to either your actual mailbox, or to your buffer-box.<p>The problem is - people have no experiencing with Google related to mail - so they may be reluctant to trust them to be part of this equation.  So they start with packages - offering a service to help out with package delivery, and acclimating people to Google being part of the mail-delivery equation.  When people are ready, they offer the scanning service.",1354374039

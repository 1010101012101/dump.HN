Also there is still a big difference between cultures who cultivate fruits and cultures who cultivate grains and legumes.<p>If they adopt grains/legumes their population will increase and their lifespans will decline. But as long as they stick to fruit and animal meat, and avoid modern diseases, they will be healthier than our society.<p>It's NOT a foregone conclusion that they experience suffering/misery.<p>It's certainly possible but in order to claim this you need to provide evidence of their suffering/misery.<p>Most likely, it's quite the opposite.

2182027,comment,2181315,2181881,0,0,forensic,,,"They go into various statistics yes.<p>But on a more qualitative note, tribal societies gain little from total war. ""Total war"" is the modern concept that every war is a struggle for existence and every avenue must be utilized to destroy the enemy culture/civilization.<p>In tribal societies most violent conflict was settled symbolically - Keegan goes into this in one of his books I forget which one.<p>For instance the tribes will line up against each other like in typical war and then attack each other, but due to various spiritual taboos against certain war practices, it's really more like a sport than what we consider war. There will be few casualties and most of the combat will be decided more like wrestling or, in some cases, even more like a dance competition. This is not a joke.<p>Obviously the particular superstitions and rituals differed among tribes, but hunter-gatherer warfare in general did not lead to even fractions of the amount of suffering that agricultural warfare leads to.<p>Having said all this, it's essentially impossible for hunter-gatherers to compete with agricultural civilization. It's a sort of prisoner's dilemma - whichever tribe ""decides"" to become agricultural will worse lives individually, but the collective is so powerful and efficient that it replicates itself.<p>Agriculture is better for our genes - we multiply far more.

You also know how to commit what you've staged, and how to view what you're about to commit.<p>So if you've started to stage some work and you're ready to stage a different commit, just commit the stuff you've already staged. e.g., let's say (for simplicity) you've edited foo and bar and want to make those changes separate commits:<p><pre><code>   $ git add foo\n   $ git diff --cached (confirm it's what you expect to commit)\n   $ git commit -m ""add fn() to foo""\n   $ git add bar\n   $ git diff --cached (confirm it's what you expect to commit)\n   $ git commit -m ""fix bug in x()""\n</code></pre>\nIn between making those two commits, you may wish to test the first commit. You could do that like this:<p><pre><code>   $ git add foo\n   $ git diff --cached (confirm it's what you expect to commit)\n   $ git commit -m ""add fn() to foo""\n   $ git stash save ""temporarily set aside work so I can test foo""\n </code></pre>\nAt this point, your unstaged/uncommitted work has been set aside and your working tree matches (with respect to the files git is tracking) the commit you just made. Here's where you can perform testing, potentially amending foo (git add, git commit --amend). Okay, you're ready to continue:<p><pre><code>   $ git stash pop\n   $ git add bar\n   $ git diff --cached (confirm it's what you expect to commit)\n   $ git commit -m ""fix bug in x()""\n\n</code></pre>\nI hope this helps. The key thing (IMO) is really to understand what git is doing under-the-hood. The git UI and (especially the) documentation are all over the place. Don't be afraid to start with a test repo and peek inside .git to see what it's doing as you execute commands.<p>Good luck!",1296865598

The agricultural knowledge passed on, the result of generations of careful observation and experimentation by Native Americans, was immense. Beyond agricultural technology and an enlightened, observational ecology, it's not even clear that the average European knew you could take a damned bath with water regularly as a healthful practice before immigrants gaped at Native Americans doing just that.  More importantly, as Ian Frazier notes in the first chapter of ""On the Rez"" which I invite all the cultural imperialists here to read, at the time of Columbus there were probably about ""eleven people in all of Europe who could do what they wanted."" Amerigo Vespucci had brought back news that in the New World, ""every one is his own master.""

I remember sites like this when I was in high school, and I graduated in 2003. Maybe you've built a better mousetrap, and maybe the world is just ready for this sort of thing now, but I'd bet there's a reason there isn't already a dominant site in this area given how long the idea has been around.<p>I remember from the high school version of this that it was horribly abused. It's a great attack vector for certain types of bullies and misguided prankster friends, and it <i>will</i> be used as such.<p>I should also point out that people can have multiple email addresses, and not all of your friends and acquaintances will know you by multiple addresses. What if I send the message from the wrong address, and my crush only knows me by something else? If she does like me, she'll have to send her own ""first message"" to my other address. If I suddenly receive another ""someone's crushin' on you"" message, wouldn't I first assume that it's someone else, since if it was my crush was mutual, I would have got a confirmation, not a request, right?<p>So let's assume that the crush is mutual. The only way the crushee to find out who I am is to put herself out there as well. It's sort of a large jump to ask someone, especially a shy someone, to make. Also, what if the crushee knows you by a couple email addresses? Which should she send a request/confirmation to? She could send it to both, but then she's using at least two out of her three freebies. If she likes two people, and knows both of them by two emails, then one of those two people can't receive a confirmation on both accounts unless the crushee decides to shell out two Euros (Around $2.70 in American/Canadian currencies). I sincerely doubt someone would do that.<p>One major problem is what I'll call ""balls."" Do women really want a guy who's too fucking timid to just come right out and say they like them? No.<p>I'll give you an example:<p>My hotmail address (used for likely-to-spam signups and as an MSN moniker) was created solely to send a ""crush"" email to a girl I liked in high school. This was back when hotmail had a directory you could use to email people you didn't have a proper address for.<p>So, I sent her a message saying basically, ""hey, we've got a couple classes together and I noticed you, etc. etc."" When I got a response back, is was just ""You've piqued my interest. Spill, who are you?"" with instructions to just man up and approach her in class. Women tend to like confident men, and men who hide behind internet filters tend not to be the confident type.<p>Finally, I just want to note that there's also a question of legality here. I can't cite a source off the top of my head, but I know there is legislation in Canada and possibly in the States that classifies ""Tell-a-Friend"" type email functionality as spam. These emails are therefore subject to fines. I don't know if they enforce it for things like this, but it's definitely something to consider.",1296865101

It lets us look at some of these issues without (perhaps) so much emotional heat.<p>So let's assume that in the 1950s, aliens contacted the president of the United States -- a theme which recurs over and over again in sci-fi. The president decided that we were too primitive and paranoid to handle contact with a galactic civilization, so he told them to leave us alone.<p>What I'm saying is that whatever the nature of the leader, whether they are the president, or prime minister, or head of NATO, or head of the UN, or whoever else, it doesn't matter. They don't have the moral authority to be making decisions like that for me. No part of the social contract allows leaders to make decisions of such huge import and keep them secret.<p>So while I support any individual's right to be left alone and live however they like, I do not support people who are presumed leaders keeping information of that magnitude from others.<p>Just to speculate a bit, if you're the chief of a tribe, or part of the power structure, it probably sounds pretty good to be left alone. After all, who wants change? However if you're a mother who just watched her 5-year-old kid die from something that was easily prevented? You might have different ideas. Keeping the mother uniformed so that you can continue exercising your power over her is immoral and I do not support it.<p>As you point out, in the real world, these kinds of things are murky at best, with lots of little conditions and details you want to consider. All I'm saying is that it's not acceptable to simply throw your hands up and give up. From what little I know, I think the idea of repeated gentle contact -- as much as it can be done without annoying them too much -- is probably the wisest course of action. This would allow us to be sure we have made a reasonable and polite effort to inform them of the outside world, as well as trying to catch the newer members of the tribe as they are born and grow up. After all, even if you're left alone, it is reasonable to expect that you still have some kind of relationship to your neighbors.",1296864568

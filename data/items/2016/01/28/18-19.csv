Read it yourself (more at the link) and reach your own conclusions, but:<p>> I was followed to the Save Mart Shopping center at Blackstone and Clinton by what I believe to be Fresno Sheriff personnel. As I was at the meat counter, a fast walking person talking on a cell phone came into the store and abruptly stopped at the main opening of the grocery store. He did a complete 360 as if he was searching for someone. I noticed him right away because of his behavior. He didn’t appear to be a typical shopper. As we made eye contact, he appeared startled that I had noticed him. I was at the meat counter which is near the entrance of the store. As I left the store with my groceries I couldn’t find him anywhere. But, as I made my way to the parking lot and started to unlock my trunk, he came out of the store, still talking on the phone. He walked past me without making eye contact and entered a late model green Chevy or GMC Step-Side truck with custom chrome rims. As I entered my car and pulled out, I drove slowly past the rear of his vehicle in an attempt to read his license plate. However I couldn’t remember the license plate number, because, as I left the store I was interrupted by a phone call. About two blocks away from the store I received a call from a person who sarcastically said my full name, then proceeded to ask me questions about a boat repair. The Number was: [...]. I’ve never had a customer address me by my first and last name before, especially someone I hadn’t talked to before. I’m confident this number and caller is connected to this SaveMart incident. I believe this person and others is related to something more complicated and devious than simple harassment. This type of “close proximity” tracking can only mean one thing. I believe this person and others are tacking and monitoring my minute by minute incremental movements so they can direct another party to illegally enter my residence for the purpose of gaining “intel” or planting evidence.<p>> Eli Rodriguez is the Fresno Sheriff personnel who was going to set me up on the Jet Ski emission scam. He dropped of a 2 stroke Evinrude motor on at my shop on 3-02-2015. His plan was to drop off the motor, then at a later time enter my property with the assistance of George and Maxine Ramirez my neighbors who were placed there by Fresno Law Enforcement personnel, plant evidence, then pick up the engine at a later time and lie and say I was trying to sell him fake emission stickers, then he would falsely arrest me. I knew something was amiss on these “emission stickers” because I was receiving a ridiculous amount of calls on them.",1454007525

10990340,comment,10989767,10989767,0,0,kelseyhightower,,,"I don&#x27;t think looking for <i>better</i> is the right way to go about this. There are many things that are different in Go which you might find a nice fit for a specific use case. Also, nothing wrong with learning another language to increase the number of tools in your toolbox.<p>I&#x27;ll list a few use-cases where I found Go to be a great fit for me.<p>Building command line tools:<p>Both Go and Python are great for building command line tools. One place where Go is different is that it&#x27;s super easy to produce statically linked, self-contained, binaries. The result is less dependancies to manage at install time. Many users find tools distributed in a self-contained binary easier to get started with -- no need to have the right runtime (python 2.x) installed.<p>Example: <a href=""https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd</a><p>Building web services:<p>I&#x27;m always building small services to solve a problem and this is one area where Go really shines for me. Out of the box Go ships with a &quot;high performance&quot; web server. Just import the &quot;net/http&quot; package and off you go. While the built-in web server is not a full replacement for something like Nginx (rate limiting, rewrite rules, etc), it does allow you to go really far without the need of an external web server for performance.<p>Example: <a href=""https://github.com/kelseyhightower/coreos-ipxe-server"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kelseyhightower/coreos-ipxe-server</a><p>There are other benefits to Go like performance gains if you are willing to trade in the flexibility you get from a dynamic language like Python and migrate to a strongly typed language that must be compiled before running your code. While Go is strongly typed it does not get in the way of getting things done. The Go compiler is fast and stays out of the way.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your background is, but I did a talk a few years ago at GopherCon 2014, &quot;Go for Sysadmins&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRbHhHFZh8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyRbHhHFZh8</a>), that provides a nice introduction into why I like Go and some live demos to drive key points home. Hope this helps.",1454007487

I&#x27;ve been through the pain of trying to find a job with no &quot;education&quot; as the system currently is. Making things more difficult doesn&#x27;t help. Companies don&#x27;t know how to judge critical thinking, that&#x27;s why they rely on degrees. It&#x27;s a cultural problem. I got lucky because someone was willing to take a gamble on me and it worked out for both of us. Not everyone with my &quot;intelligence and will to learn&quot; get so lucky as me no matter how capable they are.<p>Tech seems to be a strange exception to the rule.

10990336,comment,10982340,10985331,0,0,Mz,,,"In response to your first point, I am going to quote one of my other replies in this discussion:<p><i>One of the points you are missing is that there are two kinds of poverty: absolute and relative. Even if you could eliminate absolute poverty, there is no means to eliminate relative poverty. The minute you have a UBI, anyone who only has that is de fact poor relative to others.<p>Many years ago, I saw a study that asked people in different countries to define poverty in terms of things like how many meals per day a person ate, what kind of shelter they had, etc. The study concluded that less than 0.5 percent of Americans were poor by the standards of people in India at the time the study was conducted. Meanwhile, Americans routinely conclude that 12% to 14% of us are living below the poverty level.<p>As a homeless American, I have regular access to electricity via a public library. I have access to public toilets. I have access to cheap goods. My quality of life is likely higher than that of many people in the world who live in countries without consistent supply of electricity and other basic infrastructure that I take for granted. There are countries where women are fairly routinely raped and sometimes murdered while attempting to relieve their bowel or bladder in an open field because there is insufficient infrastructure.<p>My quality of life is likely higher than that of kings of old, who had no electricity or Internet or antibiotics etc.</i><p>As for your second point, the information being lost has to do with what choices and behaviors are problematic and which ones are of real value.<p>I agree with you that the main purpose of money is to facilitate trade. So, I find myself baffled as to why you are pro basic income. What are people trading for basic income? It makes no sense to me to create a world of consumers.<p>I worry that we are destroying the health of the system.<p>At the moment, I do not have time to discuss this further. So, I am not going to try to elaborate on that last point. Given the reception I am getting here, this is probably a waste of time anyway.<p>Take care.",1454007467

Think like the aftermath of a full nuclear war between two large super powers, or an electromagnetic storm hitting earth, or a man made virus that wipes out half the population and has the other half hiding indoors scared to go outside - borders closed and massive quarantines.<p>None of these things is particularly likely to happen IMO. But if they did happen, you suddenly have a large portion of people not being fed. When people aren&#x27;t being fed, you get uprisings, wars, and desperate people joining the roving bands of marauders that the article talks about.<p>But man, the Earth currently produces so much food. It&#x27;s incredible really how much we can do with so few humans, with modern agriculture.

This is an area where people&#x27;s moral compass overrides their shrewdness.  Notice that Anthem is still in business despite the worst possible breach, for example.<p>It&#x27;s worth trying to improve security, if possible. But it takes one of two things:  (a) leverage, or (b) patience.  One of the main reasons that companies get a security audit is because a different company forces them to.  They get an audit in order to obtain a CFD (client facing document) saying that they are secure.  Without this, the other company will not do business with them, which is the sole reason why the security audit happens.<p>The other way -- patiently pointing out ways of improving the situation, and explaining the business merits of allocating time to this pursuit -- does not usually result in meaningful security improvements.  This is an unfortunate fact of the industry, partly because security breaches do not usually put a company out of business. There are exceptions to this, but that is the common case.",1454004059

It&#x27;s telling that I learned more in three weeks of being ill and choosing to passively read books on mathematics (While coughing my guts up, of course), than I did actively participating in a course. (The only reason I am participating in the course is because I need a bit of paper that says I can do foo. A few people working in foo field have said I am at their level, it&#x27;s just mindless inane hoop-jumping.)<p>> Most people are passive. They want a teacher to lead them and guide them through the learning process.<p>Exactly, but IMO that is the fault of the schooling system itself. They&#x27;ve never had to <i>learn</i> anything themselves, because everything they know has been spoon-fed to them by their teachers. If we had a better (Differently structured) education system, then this would not be necessary.<p>Although I do not see much hope for this happening, both Russell <i>and</i> Whitehead made attempts to improve the learning systems in the UK, neither prevailed.<p>Apologies if this came across as a rant.",1454004045
10989898,comment,10988953,10988953,0,0,lutusp,,,"A classic tale of engineering gone wrong. Apropos, I designed high-efficiency 20 KHz inverters for the Space Shuttle crew quarters, flight hardware that ended up working flawlessly. But during the design phase, the primary Shuttle contractor revealed that my inverters would be exposed to much higher voltages than they had originally supposed.<p>When I saw this, I realized we would have to start over and choose different components able to tolerate the higher voltages. My managers disagreed, arguing that if we caused problems, we would be denied a follow-on contract for similar inverters to be deployed in the payload bay. The managers composed a reply to NASA in which there was no problem, things were fine, let&#x27;s forge ahead.<p>I was a mere engineer, I had no management authority, and I hadn&#x27;t been consulted about the reply. When I heard about it, I sat down and wrote a letter of resignation and pushed my letter into more hands than was absolutely necessary. I made some comparisons that at the time might have seemed over the top (like the Apollo file that killed three astronauts, a disaster resulting from lax oversight).<p>In my case, because of my having distributed the letter farther than was absolutely necessary, my managers were forced to reverse themselves, I was able to redesign my inverters in a safe way, and we got the follow-on contract in spite of not being seen as &quot;team players&quot;.<p>Many years later, at the time of the Challenger disaster, it finally dawned on me that, had I disregarded the overvoltage issue as my managers had wanted me to, and if something had gone wrong, I would have been held personally responsible, because I was the only person with the level of technical knowledge required to make the call, and my managers could disavow any responsibility. At the time, I made the right decision, but for reasons that I hadn&#x27;t fully thought out -- if my equipment had failed in-flight, I would have been held responsible, and that would have been a perfectly just outcome.",1454004041

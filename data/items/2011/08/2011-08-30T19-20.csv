2942993,comment,2941886,2942913,3,0,dcaldwell,,,"Well, to be honest, no we don't know if it'll be profitable yet.  Mostly because we just launched and don't have enough data.  We very well may introduce a monthly fee that allows nonprofits to only pay the percentag (3.5%) transaction costs that WePay charges.  We're certainly not into taking advantage of nonprofits.  Most nonprofits have under $25,000/year in revenue.  If you make $12,000/year in revenue, it's hard to even justify paying $15 or $30 per month for something that you don't know if it works.  We think with this model it will hopefully reduce the barriers to entry for small nonprofits so that they can get online quickly and easily and actually accept online donations.  The majority of nonprofit websites don't even have an online giving option.<p>Also, if we do get a sizable number of nonprofits on the system, there are other services that we'd like to offer to them down the road for an affordable price (like $5 - $15/month).  That may be a donor management database that's easy to use and stripped down for small nonprofits, a stripped down email marketing service, etc.<p>We looked into referral fees from WePay but they don't offer that for apps that use their API.  That's really fine for us though.  We kind of like the fact that we aren't telling nonprofits to use WePay with an ulterior motive of us making a little extra money.  We use WePay because it is bar none the best marketplace payment processor that we know of... and that's with them having just released their marketplace API about a month ago.",1314734313

You wouldn't use a spreadsheet to design a web page so by the same token a table is just as unsuitable.<p>CSS support is a lot better and more consistent across browsers now than it was even just a year ago, and there are CSS 'frameworks' that make grid based design a trivial task without cluttering your page with table markup where it's not required.<p>There are even plenty HTML5 'frameworks' (or templates if you prefer) that take backwards compatibility and such like into account so you don't have to faff about with all that yourself.<p><a href=""http://www.blueprintcss.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blueprintcss.org/</a>

If Justin.tv makes a good deal, it will naturally be a good deal for investors.<p>An example might clarify it. Let's say Justin.tv thinks SocialCam is worth $1 million.

But the company is worth $500K more, or $1.5 million. $1.5 million / 150 shares = $10K per share, the original price).<p>- Grant options with a $10K strike price.

(Note how I phrased that in energy terms this time, that's an important point.) You can't actually subsidize something of that size to profitability, because the energy industry is on of the <i>bases</i> of the economy; if oil is a net loss, the whole edifice comes crumbling down regardless of what you do. You can't subsidize the oil industry into net energy profitability with wealth taxed away from dry cleaners and accountants, and it doesn't matter what games you play with dollars if you aren't making a true net energy profit at the base of the economic structure.<p>Wind and solar both generally barely break even or barely above if you take a full accounting of their energy inputs and costs, biofuels are often a net loss (depends on the crop, but I think the balance of the argument has corn ethanol as a net loss, cane sugar seems to be a net gain, but...), and the problem is they're competing with things that easily get tens of times of returns on energy expended with the fossil fuels and nuclear power.<p>One of the things you rarely see correctly computed is what it would truly take to power our entire society with renewable energy, <i>including</i> the sudden new energy expenditures necessary to keep our purely-renewable infrastructure maintained with replacement gear. As the net energy benefit of the average piece of gear approaches 1x, the necessary expenditures approach infinity. Replacing 10-25x sources with 1.5-3x sources requires yet again far more resources than the naive multiplications and divisions would imply, if you don't make the mistake of assuming free infrastructure that never decays, or one-time-cost infrastructure that never decays.<p>(Incidentally, this is why cheap solar, in the sense of truly cheaper without government subsidy solar, is exciting. A solar panel that can make back 5-10x the expenditure to make and install it, and isn't a massive expenditure of metal and glass and silicon is a big deal, it makes things practical that weren't before. Or a solar installation consisting of lots of cheap reflectors concentrating the energy on a centralized station. I still think we might be able to go both net positive and practical on solar. Wind I'm less optimistic about, it's difficult to see what we can cut out of our wind generators and still have wind generators the way we can cut down on the mass/energy footprint of a solar installation with clever engineering. In the limiting case, a reflector is a sheet of foil and an amortized central station; a wind generator is an entire wind generator.)",1314730884

</code></pre>
(where the caret stands for exponentiation, of course).  This is called a <i>quadratic</i> function.  Here are some example values:<p><pre><code>  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  0  1  4  9 16 25 36 49 64 81
</code></pre>
This is the kind of relationship you have described: when x is doubled, f(x) is quadrupled.<p>Now consider this function:<p><pre><code>  f(x) = 2 ^ x
</code></pre>
This is an example of a function that is properly called <i>exponential</i>.  Here are some example values:<p><pre><code>  0  1  2  3  4  5  6   7   8   9
  1  2  4  8 16 32 64 128 256 512

Here, every time x <i>increases by 1</i>, the value is <i>doubled</i>.  See how much faster it grows?<p>In very practical terms, the difference between a ""power law"", as functions of the form x ^ k are called, and an exponential, of the form k ^ x, is massive.

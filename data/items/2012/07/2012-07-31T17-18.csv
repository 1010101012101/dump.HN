The various features of FB events make them ""stickier"" (or whatever the buzzword is) than regular advertising...the feedback options, with prospective attendees asking questions and seeing how you respond to them, is also likely to boost interest. It's not quite fair to say ""Oh, this is the same as Craigslist ad postings, except you paid"" just as it would be silly to ignore Airbnb because it seems just like paid Craigslist ad postings.<p>That said, given the nature of the niche market here (though you probably know better than anyone), it's not clear that the success would easily apply to other kinds of businesses...or phases (i.e. a startup trying to get attention vs. a business having a out-of-business clearance sale).",1343757534

4318692,comment,4318290,4318290,9,0,kennon,,,"I don't think this is news to anyone who's familiar with the rising popularity of social games. During the facebook gaming boom, ""pink"" games far outpaced ""blue"" ones in popularity and profit. I worked at a zynga competitor around 2008-10 and it was very clear that female audiences were less demanding, less prone to cheating, and more willing to regularly spend money (in the aggregate) than their male counterparts. In other words: lower maintenance, easier profits. We would release the exact same feature in two games-- one pink and one blue-- and the pink game's revenues would spike while the blue's flatlined. Definitely not a scientific approach, but one that repeated itself on multiple occasions.<p>All of this transitioned nicely into mobile social games, where we are today. There is some risky gender stereotyping that can arise in tandem with these kinds of discussions, but from my experience the revenues make it pretty clear which audience to target.",1343757484

The three column format is identical; it is mainly cleaner because it removes useful features: inline email text preview, a prominent search box, navigation to other frequently used services, e.g. drive. On first glance sparse designs look better, but for frequently used software people tend to like the greater data density in practice. I also image that they will introduce l their own navigation bar to other services at some point, so that minor distinction would be temporary. On the hand it is far better than Microsoft's existing offering, and being able to integrate with third party social services rather than g+ is a substantial difference they should continue to run with.",1343757227

If you want that, go hire some social science people to study it.<p>However my personal, anecdotal experience is that peer coworkers that I've had who did not have college degrees have, on average, been better than ones who did.  By ""peer coworker"" I mean ""working with me, with a job title similar to or better than mine"".  By ""better"" I mean ""impressed me more"".  My measure of being impressed is what I thought of the quality and quantity of work that I saw them doing.<p>I have no idea what their salaries were like.  There were some that I <i>know</i> were making less than coworkers with degrees, even though I thought that their work was better.  Most I never had a discussion about salaries with.<p>That said, on the whole I would wager that discriminated against workers get a worse salary even if their productivity is equivalent or better.  Why?  Because salary is the result of a negotiation, one of whose inputs is what your alternate options are.  People are not paid what they are worth to the company.  They are paid what the company thinks it needs to pay them to keep them happy, and the difference between that and their worth is kept by the company as profit.  (Companies that do not act this way soon find that they are not able to make a profit and some time later find themselves out of business...)  If some employees have a hard time being paid more elsewhere, then they will often be satisfied with less from you.<p>This phenomena is presumably why the paper that I pointed you to measured productivity on the basis of company growth and profitability, and not on paid salary.",1343757130

I understand your point that candidates that succeed despite not having a degree are probably better than a lot of people with degrees.  But you are making a stronger claim than that; you're saying that discriminated groups that succeed in getting hired are probably better than others that also got in.  Now, you did provide a link to a study that was true of women but I would want to see evidence specific to people with degrees versus those without.  The problem with generalizing the way you seem to be is that the people you hire without a degree may not have been competing against the people you hired with degrees.<p>For example, suppose you have two positions to fill that are basically the same.  You fill one position with person A that doesn't have a degree and you fill another position with person B that has a degree.  Person A may have gotten the position because they beat people with and without degrees that were also applying to the position.  The same applies to person B.  On one hand, you're saying that person B will get some level of preferential treatment because he/is has a degree.  But on the other hand, you're saying that person A is probably better than person B in a manner that isn't reflected in the basic competency tests that were used to hire them in the first place.  However, at this point you're comparing apples to oranges because they weren't hired from the pool of candidates.<p>Moreover, I don't know what you mean by ""better"".  You might say that someone that succeeds despite lacking a degree is probably more passionate than an equally hireable person that had a degree.  He/she may have more job experience.  He/she may have passed with an A+ from the school of hard knocks.  It seems to me that the only way to quantify this and aggregate over individual differences would be to compare the long-term salaries of people with degrees versus those without.  Pay may seem like a coarse measure of whether an employee is better or not (I should know because I left a job in which I was underpaid for years despite being productive) but it is at least a simple measure of how much a company actually values an employee.",1343755932

Delayed::Job lets you assign tasks a priority and lets you assign queue workers to priority levels it is allowed to look at.  By convention, priority 0 (highest) is interactive tasks in my applications (a user is at their keyboard waiting for an answer) and priority 10 (least priority) is, well, Mixpanel.  Not because I don't love them, just because if Mixpanel blocks for an entire month my rent still gets paid and that isn't true of any other priority level.<p>Queue worker A only works on priorities 0 through 9.  Queue worker B works on 0 through 10.  This ensures that even if Mixpanel (or Kissmetrics, also on 10) perpetually times out the higher-priority levels will never be totally blocked.<p>Delayed::Job worker processes are monitored by god, which resets them if they fail, become bloated, etc.  They're also separately monitored by Scout monitoring's DJ plugin, which fires a yellow alert if a job is ever older than an hour (shouldn't happen but can in event of e.g. an API outage) or a red alert if there's ever more than X jobs in the queue (high probability that this represents a crash god can't recover from).<p>Because even that setup was letting through about one outage every six months to a year, I have one other ace-in-the-hole: my ajax polling actions which check whether particular jobs are complete will, if they fail Y times in a row, a) instantiate a queue worker within the web server process (this degrades request processing but can't totally break the site) and b) fire off an independent-from-everything-else phone call to my cell phone saying ""Your first, second, and third line of defense have failed.

And, if you are a programmer, you can go to town writing your own customizations with VBA.<p>I use Yahoo Mail online for most of my personal stuff.  Out of all the online email offerings out there I have found it to be the most ""polished"" (if I can use that term) and outlook-like.  I tried Gmail a couple of years back and just didn't do it for me.  As an example, the lack of a real time preview pane was a huge deal breaker for me.  Both Outlook and Yahoo Mail have this.  Maybe Gmail has this now, I don't know.<p>The other thing about Gmail that scared the crap out of me was to watch as one of our clients had their Gmail account evaporate because their AdSense account got shut down.  They were new to the platform and made a couple of dumb and innocent mistakes off the line.  Google bots summarily shut-down the account with no recourse or anyone to contact.  As their account got suspended so went Gmail.  I'll let you venture a guess as to whether or not these people are using any Google products now.<p>Here's a feature I wish email clients would implement:  Tabbed accounts.<p>I run more than one company and regularly monitor a dozen email accounts.  Outlook and Yahoo Mail allow you to setup rules to deliver email from specific accounts into designated folders.  With Outlook you can also choose to store the email in separate files. That's all well and fine, but the whole thing has the risk of becoming cluttered and difficult to use after a while.<p>There's an Outlook hack that allows you to launch multiple Outlook instances.  This works very well as I can launch one instance that opens the email addresses corresponding to one business and another instance with a separate business.  Having multiple monitors makes this even handier.<p>What would be even better is if I could do the same thing with tabs. I want one tab per business --or a user-designated category.  Each tab would receive and send email from one or many email addresses.  They would all be independent while having relevant sharing capabilities (copy and past, drag and drop, etc.).<p>It's about context switching.<p>With something like that I could have a single email client handle all of my business email as well as personal within one application window.  That would be slick.",1343754958

4318388,comment,4317524,4317524,1,0,lambda,,,"Myth 1 is completely false. While companies will be careful about what they have summer interns write, they are absolutely expecting to get real value out of the intern's work. They are spending both money, and the time of the mentor(s) on the intern; do you think they are doing that for charity? Yes, you need to plan for the case that the intern doesn't successfully complete their project; that's why you have things like revision control and code review, to ensure that they don't do more harm than good, and you don't give them a project that absolutely needs to be completed by the end of the summer. Though at most places I've been, there has been more than enough urgent, mission-critical work that the existing developers couldn't possibly finish, so some of it does go to interns as it's not like the existing developers would have gotten to it in that time anyhow. I am mentoring several interns right now, and their code is shipping to customers already, in a core, mission-critical component of our stack.<p>Myth 2 is something that I'm sure that no one believes. Sure, people try to pick out reasonably scoped and specced projects for interns to work on, just as they do for anyone to work on, but that doesn't mean that they succeed, and I can't imagine that anyone would expect perfection. Furthermore, dealing with ambiguity, changing specs, scope creep, and the like is part of the value of the internship; you're going to have to learn how to deal with that eventually.<p>Myth 3 is about the only good point of advice here. It is difficult for a mentor to provide enough time for their interns. They usually have a variety of other things to do. But the interns won't be very effective if they sit around stuck waiting for help. Being assertive, and asking for help when you're stuck, will allow you to get a lot more out of an internship than just sitting around waiting for someone to mentor you.",1343754667

4318376,comment,4317242,4317659,46,0,Terretta,,,"> <i>A piano that has not been regularly tuned will lose its ability to stay tuned</i><p>Having tuned pianos for about six years, I think this is a misconception.  An piano left untuned for many years will certainly lose its ability to be retuned in a single tuning.  Owners who try to bring it back into tune with a single tuning will fail, and think it can't be retuned.  That's completely normal.  What's more, retuning it correctly (evenly distributed tension) may be beyond the casual neighborhood tuner.  But the absolute inability to be retuned is rare.<p>On the other hand, if the strings need replacing (sound dead, tinny, or thin, after as many as 50 years for good strings or as few as 10 for poor ones) or the tuning pins don't hold (long term lack of climate control), the piano probably needs restringing, which is labor and skill intensive and maybe not worth the time and money (from one to several grand) compared to purchasing a new piano (Costco has surprisingly good prices!) unless it has sentimental or collector value.  But if you don't mind the expense, even with bad strings and tuning pins, the piano can be fixed and tuned.<p>Provided the tuning pins hold and the strings aren't ruined, a piano can generally be retuned in a patient series of 3 - 5 tuning sessions to <i>gradually</i> (with ample settling time between sessions) bring the whole (strings, soundboard, plate, bridges) back into well balanced tension.",1343754555

But if you only have search, then surely the search itself implies that you have a way to classify the data!<p>Personally, I think this is enough to stop the spread (if not the storage) of horror.

4318334,comment,4317313,4317720,3,0,smacktoward,,,"<i>The desktop really doesn't need reinventing</i><p>The problem is that the devices where the traditional WIMP interface make the most sense (desktop & laptop PCs) are on track to become a small niche in the overall computing landscape, thanks to the wild growth in mobile and tablet computing. While desktops and laptops aren't going to disappear anytime soon, they're not where the action is.<p>So if you're a maker of an operating environment, you can stick with an interface that's highly optimized for desktops and laptops, but that severely reduces the relevance of your work.<p>It's like choosing to make an operating environment today that only runs on IBM mainframes. Those mainframes exist, they're still out there, and you can still make money selling software for them; but that choice makes your product irrelevant to the vast majority of computer users today. And when you slot yourself into a niche, you can never grow larger than the niche you've slotted yourself into. If you want to be an industry leader, you have to be playing in the same space where the users are; you can't get any further back in the parade than the middle.<p>All the significant commercial developers of traditional WIMP environments today (which means Microsoft, Apple, and Canonical) are struggling with how to make this transition -- to stay relevant on the desktop while also extending themselves into the tablet/mobile realm. It's a big challenge, and it's not clear at this point that any of them have figured out how to do it yet. But they have to do it to stay viable as mass-market vendors.<p>I would imagine the pressure to make that transition is even greater on open-source projects like GNOME. If you're a commercial player stuck in a niche, that's not necessarily a bad outcome if the niche is at least profitable. But open-source development is driven more by developer ambition. Developers want to work on hot new projects that lots of people will use, not old stable projects for niche audiences. In a commercial environment you can salve their disappointment at being stuck with the boring old projects somewhat with cash and perks. That's less true in FOSS development. So the talent flees your ecosystem to go work on things that are more fun, and you slowly die by inches.",1343754165

Before the proprietary app was created, <i>it didn't exist</i>.  By any practical measure, the distinction between a software developer not creating an app at all, and creating it but only being willing to share it under terms that are unacceptable to a given person is nil.  Regardless of how you get there, not having the app is not having the app.<p>Proprietary software licensing is just a type of contract.  And like any other contract, it only applies to people who voluntarily choose to enter into it.  And the ability of individuals to freely enter into agreements whereby they exchange goods and services, perhaps subject to additional conditions, is an essential feature of free society.  If nobody's forcing you to enter into the contract, then your freedom is intact.<p>On the other hand, pressuring those to whom the contract is acceptable to avoid entering it suggests a lack of respect for the freedoms of those who disagree with oneself.  Just as assuming that someone who doesn't agree with you just doesn't understand your position suggests a more general lack of respect for those who disagree with oneself.",1343754084

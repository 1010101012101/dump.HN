25051,comment,24938,24975,0,0,spez,,,"-- ""almost everything"" is a bit of an overstatement, I think.<p>Well the rest of the Internet disagrees with you.<p>--would be more accurate.<p>Yet you continue to claim reddit doesn't ""validate input in any text boxes on the site.""<p>--creator of reddit found the same exact exploit months ago<p>No. The exploit on YC news was an XSS exploit in link submissions that allowed me to run javascript on any YC user's client.<p>--textbook XSS exploit.<p>Hardly. There was no hidden JS, which is the defining characteristic of an XSS exploit. Certainly we shouldn't allow JS links, but making the claims you have are nothing more than a bogus stretch for attention.<p>Congrats on receiving it...<p>",1180362126

And who is writing a ""self-less"" blog anyway? My guess is: nobody. So let's just discard the myth of the holy blogger.<p>Another thought: whose review of a product is likely to be more neutral, the one from a blogger who bought it with his own money, or the one from the blogger who got the product in the mail for free? My guess is the one who got it for free might actually be more ""objective"", because otherwise there is that psychological effect that people estimate things higher that they paid for, so that they don't feel stupid.

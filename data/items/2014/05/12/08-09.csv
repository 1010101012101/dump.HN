And that this is wrong:<p>> By committing to using ECL logic (read: cost is basically no object)<p>because cost is hardly the only challenge when working with ECL. And that this is not only a truism, but also unenlightening from a historical perspective:<p>> If he&#x27;d been confined to CMOS (or to a somewhat lesser extent bipolar) logic, he&#x27;d have had a very different set of trade-offs to get the performance he needed.<p>First, ECL <i>is</i> bipolar logic, like anything built with BJTs.

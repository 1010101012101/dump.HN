3716011,comment,3715894,3715894,8,0,psychotik,,,"Apple's done a couple of <i>really</i> bad things here:<p>1) Developers who build without XCode 4.3.1 and iOS 5.1 SDK cannot leverage the retina display, even if they embed hi-res images in their app.<p>2) In order to use XCode 4.3.1 and iOS 5.1 SDK, you MUST be running OSX Lion. You can not install it on Snow Leopard. This is bad - Apple has always supported ""up to two versions back"" but now, for a minor version release, has abandoned support for an OS that is still 'current'. Mountain Lion isn't released yet, and hence Lion and Snow Leopard and the last two versions.<p>What this means is developers who need to update their apps have to first buy OSX Lion (many have been legitimately holding off because it's pretty crappy, overall). This is specially worse for developers who build OSX and iOS apps - upgrading an OS and expecting your apps to ""just work"" isn't practical. I was just waiting to skip to Mountain Lion directly, but this forces me to pay Apple, test on and use Lion for a few months even though I don't want to.<p>Forcing developers to upgrade their OS just to support a .1 SDK update is a cheap, non-classy move by Apple.",1331945963

3715970,comment,3715171,3715574,5,0,drostie,,,"To raise something to the 3rd power in modular math is done by computing:<p><pre><code>    x = x  x
    x = x  x
</code></pre>
In other words, two modular multiplications. I have grouped them like this because, to raise something to the 17th power in modular math is done by computing:<p><pre><code>    x = x  x
    x = x  x
    x = x  x
    x = x  x
    x = x  x
</code></pre>
So that's 5 multiplications. If the exponent is 2^m + 1, we can generalize to say that it requires m + 1 multiplications; 17 is 2^4 + 1 and thus requires 4 + 1.<p>Of course, we're a long way from that, even. To raise something to the 2 + 1 = 65537 power requires 17 multiplications. When you see these times of 10.6 s and 23.9 s for these respectively, this means that the multiplication isn't really the bottleneck yet. Let us imagine that the multiplication needs to be initialized in a constant time, then we could say that:<p><pre><code>    10.6 = 2 t + C
    23.9 = 17 t + C
</code></pre>
Solving, I get that the constant overhead is 8.8 s while the time t for a multiplication is just 0.9 s or so. So the constant time is about 10 multiplications worth! We can then test this for the next case, e=2^32 + 1, which is listed as 42.7 s, the linear fit above suggests 0.9*33 + 8.8 = 38.5, which is not too bad of an estimate. (I suspect that it starts to use the general exponentiation algorithm, which requires that you do some bitwise operations to figure out whether you multiply an accumulating variable; that control logic might make up the missing 4 s.)<p>All of these have the same number of 1 bits. It runs in time proportional to the number of total bits in the binary representation of e, not just the 1 bits. Other than that you're mostly right -- in the real world there are evidently constants and perhaps some curvature when nonstandard exponents are used.",1331944797

If you had <i>any</i> other phone you had to wait a long time to even get confirmation that your current flagship device would even get ICS. Most enthusiasts run ICS on their Nexus S and have done so for months. And google never announces when to roll out updates since it isn't rolled out for everyone at once.<p>And don't blame google for the messed up market in the US. Best of all is that you are not locked in some vendor version of android. Even if some carrier managed to install bejeweled on your device (again, sucks to be in the US?) that's it, you don't get a vendor specific phone-application etc. etc.<p>Nexus devices are getting updates sooner, they get longer support, they don't get ruined by bloatware (you might still argue that they don't get enough support, or get updates soon enough but you can't get anything better in the android world). You've tried but you seriously can't point to a single exception to that (surprised it took samsung so long to get ICS out for SGSII, it took HTC what, two weeks to roll out Froyo for the Desire?).

Since I created that arrangement, since that arrangement is the fruit of my labor, by natural law I have property rights to it.<p>And since it's quite literally impossible for you to be deprived of that particular arrangement of words, images, etc., it's physically impossible for your right to be violated.<p>But you're not claiming just that limited property right; you're saying that you ought to be entitled to restrict others from independently creating their own replica of that arrangement of words, images, etc. which goes far beyond the scope of property rights.<p>> Property rights extend beyond private enjoyment. Asked and answered.<p>Into what other areas, then?  I'm construing 'private enjoyment' here as the ability to direct the disposition of the associated property without restraint; but how does this extend to directing the disposition of other people's replicas of your property?  How does it apply to inherently intangible and non-rival goods?<p>> I never said there was a ""positive right to a market return""; that was the entire point of the house example.<p>The house example was a non-sequitur.  In your example, the state seized your house from you and rented it back to you; they took something that was physically owned by you, and imposed their own constraints on its use and disposition.  This is a clear violation of your rights.  Again, I'm not seeing how it at all compares to other people independently creating a replica of something you own without imposing any constraints on you.<p>The only effect third-party copying can have on you is the alteration of external market conditions, potentially reducing the financial return you can obtain from selling copies of the work yourself; but again, you never had any right to guaranteed financial returns, so no right of yours is actually being violated here.<p>> All property rights require some legal mechanism to be enforceable.<p>Absolutely false.  Physical property is inherently tangible and rival, meaning that only a finite number of individuals can control its disposition at any one time; it's therefore impossible for physical property to exist without <i>someone</i> establishing decisive control over it (or it being abandoned, in which case you might say it's not 'property' at all).<p>Now, people may seek to embody the process by which people establish decisive control over physical property in some sort of deliberative or judicial context, in order to reduce the possibility of disruption of their social groups arising from property disputes, but it would be inaccurate to suggest that without such a system, the concept of property would simply not exist.<p>> Without deeds and titles I couldn't even own my house.<p>No.  Deeds and titles are post-hoc formalizations that <i>recognize</i> property rights; they aren't the primordial <i>source</i> of property rights.",1331943395

It's a question of continuing to learn and make progress towards your goal over a long period of time (in this case, how to build a successful startup). Malcolm Gladwell calls it ""deliberate practice"".<p>For whatever reason most people can't do it, and that's okay, startups are not for everyone. But if you want to be a Pinterest type success, then that's what it will take.",1331942790

And I believe that many newer Firefox extensions do not expose any chrome: URIs, so this technique might not work for all Firefox extensions.",1331942786

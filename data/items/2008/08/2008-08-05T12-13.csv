267405,comment,267170,267388,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Yep sure.<p>For example, ""3,000 pentamillionaires to discuss their path to success. Perhaps not surprisingly, none of them had a cushy union job down at the DMV. The vast majority — 80% — either started their own business or worked for a small company that saw explosive growth. And almost all of them made their fortune in a big lump sum after many years of effort.""<p>I'm sure Nasim would have laughed at this. Firstly, selecting a group of successful people and asking what made them successful makes u fall into a trap of believing that these factors led them to success and hence whoever adopts these factors will be as successful as them. Secondly, for each millionaire there would be many other normal people who did what the millionaire did but didn't see their bank account swelling. For a study to be insightful, the participants should have as many losers (if not more) as winners.<p>Moreover, article confuses correlation with causality.<p>The article is like: Google, Yahoo, Amazon, etc. have one thing in common: Silicon Valley hence being in Silicon Valley will get you to that status. Tell me how many startups actually become Google-like?",1217940822

Of course posting here didn't really lead to repeat users, since our site is aimed primarily at students, but it was nonetheless encouraging.

Whether it is actually beautiful is debatable, but I think it is, and that buzz keeps me going.<p>I get sad when I make a toy and no one plays with it. Is that what you're feeling?

No one wants to sign-up for an email address that will go away if they ever decide to stop using the rest of the service. And, no one wants to pay full price for something if they're not going to use all the features. Make the email free (me.com is a pretty cool email) and people will start to whip out their annual Benjamins for the rest of the service!<p>Maybe Eddy Cue, the new head of MobileMe, reads HN.

Of course you can see no ""redemming value"" right now.  If you just planted seeds in your garden out back, you wouldn't see any results there either, <i>today</i>.<p>But just as the seeds in your garden will deliver results in a few months (provided you care for them), the seeds you just planted in your little ""hairbrained"" project, will also reap dividends.  You just don't know when or what.<p>Sometime in the future when you least expect it, the lightbulb will go on and you'll figure out a cool solution to some other problem.  What you don't know now (and probably won't even realize then) was that what you did today stirred a few neurons to enable that light bulb to go on in the future.<p>As hackers, <i>everything</i> we do is either planting seeds or reaping harvest.  If you didn't see a harvest today, that's because you were planting seeds.  Just keep on working and trust the process; that's how we all get better at what we do.",1217937711

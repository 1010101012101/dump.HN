That's one of the reasons I lost motivation and shut down the site, it is extraordinarily difficult for coupons/discounts to add value to businesses across the spectrum of business. Some businesses it works great for, many it doesn't. It was when I had that realization that I decided to end it.<p>I did spend time (sorry, probably not ""much time"") brainstorming business ideas that actually would add value to the businesses I knew, and I think some of those ideas are good, but just not feasible for me to do alone, so I'm not even pursuing them either.<p>I have a friend that has spent _years_ and tons of his own money working on his startup, and it's still struggling to succeed. I learned a lot from him as he was my mentor through this process. I hope his endeavor takes off, but it's a long road, and he has worked incredibly hard. I can connect the two of you if you actually want to talk to someone like that.",1315767567

In some or even many cases, this will be below the ""the absolute minimum pay market rate for the level of talent ... require[d].""<p>If you view that as a sign of disrespect, then you should probably only ever work for 1)bootstrapped businesses that are pretty far along the bootstrap curve or 2) venture-funded businesses that have significant funding.

2984405,comment,2983639,2983639,7,0,Terretta,,,"This headline (by the author or editor) is completely misrepresenting the article.<p>HDMI cables are different.  Badly made ones, and ones rated differently, can fail in unpredictable ways.  The article describes failure modes, and alludes to but brushes over technical differences.<p>Coincidentally, I personally spent 16+ hours on the better part of this past Thursday and Friday nights trying to get a Cablevision set top box (OptimumTV) to cooperate with an Onkyo receiver over HDMI.<p>I'd been using the receiver with a variety of equipment, and with a long run to a wall mounted TV, for several years.  I swapped in a new TV, and added the set top box, and suddenly all HDMI related functions of the receiver started failing randomly, 90% of the time.<p>I eventually attributed this to HDMI negotiation between receiver and Cablevision's box.  With STB plugged in, Boxee and DVD player would fail too.  Without STB, the others would work.<p>With eight cables I had on hand, all ""known good"", the receiver HDMI indicator would either fail to light, with no picture and no sound on the TV, or blink rapidly, and the picture and sound would come and go rapidly.  (To me, this suggests a flawed implementation of HDCP by the Optimium box, likely failing the receiver handshake as it acts as a repeater between STB and the TV, and this Onkyo has a hardware upscaler. An HDCP cable failure is alluded to in the CNET article, but all eight types I had on hand failed in the same way.)<p>Cable brands that failed:  Monoprice, Amazon Essentials, Radio Shack, Firedog (Best Buy), and Monster. Also, these were all cables purchased before 2010.<p>I was not in the mood to buy a new receiver just to work with Cablevision's box, so I decided to try the Home Depot ""installer"" aisle, and selected ""GE Ultra Pro HDMI with Ethernet"" in a two pack of 6' lengths, and a 15' foot ""in wall"" installer kit as well.<p><a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202742223/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202742223/h_d2/Produ...</a><p>These are labeled as supporting audio return channel, 3D, and Ethernet, and are rated for 4K video (not mentioned in the linked article).  The Cablevision OptimumTV set top box does not use any of these features.<p>When I used this new HDMI cable, the whole system worked flawlessly.  Dumbfounded, I repeatedly swapped in my other cables, but they all failed, while these worked.  I had both a 15' and two 6' ones from this brand, and all three worked.<p>So no, not all HDMI cables are the same.  I cannot attribute this particular behavior to ""bad cables"" or even ""cheap cables"", it has to be some feature of the cable design.<p><i>// Disclaimer: I dislike cable TV for its ""bundling"" practices, and hope Google wins their custom Hulu bid to force the studios to keep content online for non cable subscribers longer.

I couldn't agree more with the recommendation of picking an old-school game and setting out to copy it. When it comes down to it, I pretty much learned to program games by, uh, programming games. Crappy ones, initially, but eventually pretty good ones. Then, an ""A+"" title at Naughty Dog.<p>I remember ""discovering"" double-buffering in high school when my friends and I were creating an Archon clone for the Atari ST (a 68000-based machine). My sprite was tearing and flickering all over the place; I then realized <i>that's</i> what double buffering was for. Sort of in the spirit of the modern (and massively overhyped) hackathons like the one that's going on in NYC this weekend, we'd stay up for 48 hours straight coding. Snow days were the best: you might get 4-5 whole days of hacking in! Man, we learned a lot coding clones of old games.<p>We made a PacMan clone with 100 levels. Sure, it was just a PacMan clone, but we had incredible fun making it, and it ended up being not only a great lesson for me in game programming, but an early lesson in how to structure a ""big"" program. (""Big"" in quotes because it was only big relative to other stuff I'd written.)<p>And lest you think this kind of thing went out with the 16-bit era, I met a 13-year-old earlier this year who made a very convincing Pole Position clone in Flash. I'm totally hiring this kid when he's old enough for me to legally do so... unless PG funds his first startup when he's 15. :)<p>So, yeah -- if you want to learn how to code games, start coding a 2D sprite classic from the 70s or 80s and, most importantly, <i>finish it</i>. It might take you a year or more, but by the end you will have learned <i>a lot</i>. Then do the same thing with a more modern 3D game (a Doom-style POV game, for example).

Let such a person make that bad decision if this is their inclination is a libertarian attitude. But millions of people make a similarly bad decision affects us all.""<p>I assumed you were describing a recent real-world scenario where exactly this occurred. What did you have in mind, if not the recent US mortgage crisis? It seems, to me, that real examples are more useful than imagined ones. If we are using imaginary problems, we can come up with all sorts of interesting solutions, but they don't necessarily carry over to real world problems.<p>Thought experiments can be useful tools, but when the results conflict with reality, you have to be willing to adjust and accommodate new data.<p>""Especially in the presence of cartels or monopolies.""<p>Which cartels and monopolies do you have in mind? The biggest monopolies and cartels I can think of in the US are those that have government support to protect their monopoly. Phone, cable, power, water, are the most firmly held monopolies (occasionally duopolies) in the US, for instance, and all are protected by government. Toll roads in the northeast are another good example of government-endorsed monopolies (I'm not saying the toll roads are necessarily a bad thing, just that they are solidly a monopoly; you can't really drive from NYC to anywhere without travelling on those toll roads, and they are, by far, the most expensive toll roads I've ever driven on, and I travel full-time in a motorhome, so I've seen a lot of toll roads).<p>Microsoft was frequently called a monopoly for several years, but the market eventually removed those monopolistic powers. Anti-trust actions barely put a dent in their power, and targeted quite small, quite unimportant elements. The market is where the real change came from. Heck, many of the remaining strongholds for Microsoft are in governments, which are unable to move as fast as private organizations. And, a not insignificant amount of Microsoft's power came from having a stranglehold on government schools, offices, etc.<p>I can't think of many other good monopoly examples that aren't government-backed, though I'm sure there are some examples. I'm willing to believe that anti-trust legislation has a place; but I'm also very suspicious of the argument that all government is good government because monopolies and cartels are dangerous, which seems to be the root of your bias against libertarianism or reduced government.",1315764796

Just compare and contrast the organization over time.<p>From the systems standpoint, Google is great. People continue to think that <i>if we just got the right people</i> -- smart, college-educated, libertarians, whatever -- that systems wouldn't ossify. But until you've seen a group of brilliant people self-create themselves a living hell, and realize that each person was acting in a reasonable, intelligent fashion, it's tough to really grok that. We naturally want to assign blame. It prevents us from doing the meta thinking necessary. One of the reasons democracies work so well is that we can easily assign personal blame to a politician, then peacefully get rid of him and bring somebody else in. There's a tremendously useful social mechanism at work.<p>I think there's a separate discussion about what you want government to do for you. I've gotten to the point where after listening to so many idealists on both the left and right I just gave up: whatever your social goals, that's fine. I just want an acknowledgement that you are aware of he trade-offs you are creating. I prefer lots of little, agile, self-optimizing systems. I think over time people could probably reach many of the social goals they have. But to do so you need to have the right tools. You'll never get from point A to point B trying to use a screwdriver as a hammer.<p>As an example a lot of us can relate to, there are a lot of technology teams with a huge amount of personal freedom that have all sorts of benefits and create vast amounts of value. We got that way by millions of little failures from which we harvest some generic best practices that then we pick up, try, and adapt one bit at a time for that particular situation. But there are even more folks, hundreds of thousands of people, living a death march because they tried to create huge systems with lots of little rules and processes. These huge systems never spring forth fully-formed from the head of Zeus. When you really start looking at them, it's a story of incrementalism and tough trade-offs. Everybody has a little architecture astronaut inside of them. Maybe not a lot, but enough to cumulatively screw things up given enough scale and time. If anything, smart people are the worst at this. They can even understand my points and try as hard as they can not to do it -- and still do it. Hominids are funny creatures.",1315764498

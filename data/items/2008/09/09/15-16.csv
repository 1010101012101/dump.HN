I have about 70 before I got tired of looking.<p>What would you think of something like this applied to slinkset sites?

299503,comment,299072,299437,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"He may be suggesting that you buy some Dohar Cattle Feed Company stock (that's what I get when I search Google Finance for 'DCF'), but it's probably a reference to discounted cash flow, a very useful tool for evaluating certain business.<p>The idea of DCF is to split up the value of an investment into chunks of future cash flow, and ask yourself how much you'd pay for each chunk. For a simple example, if you have a business that's sure to pay you $100, once, a year from now, you ask yourself: how much would I have to put in the bank, now, to get $100 on that date? That amount is the present value of that cash flow.<p>Now consider a business that will pay that same certain $100, but after <i>two</i> years. The principle is the same -- how much would you put into a bank account now to get that same $100 on the same date?<p>To further complicate things, imagine that you're betting on a coin flip: two years from now, you will get either $100 (heads) or $0 (tails). To figure out the net present value, you'd first determine the average outcome ($50), then decide how much you'd have to put in a risk-free account now to get that amount in two years.*<p>Put these together, and you can understand the DCF framework. Let's say you have a business that earned $100 last year, and that you expect to earn about 5% more each year thereafter. <i>But</i> in any given year, there's a 10% chance that the business will go under. The discounted future value is that same procedure, repeated for each year: the price you should pay is how much you'd invest in a bank account now for a 90% chance of $105 in a year, <i>plus</i> an 81% chance of $110.25 in two years, etc., or sum(100 * 1.05^n * .9^n * [1 - risk-free interest rate]^n).<p>So now all you have to do is 1) figure out what the business will earn every year from now until the end of time, and 2) figure out the intrinsic value of a given sum of money to be delivered at a given future date. These are both, of course, impossible. But rough estimates get you pretty close to where you need to be, and it provides a good way to compare two stable-growth businesses in the same industry (how much should you pay for a soft drink company growing at 3% each year, versus an otherwise identical company growing at  5% each year, for example?).<p>* This assumes you have an infinite tolerance for risk. But a one in a billion chance of one billion dollars is probably not worth a dollar -- or, rather, it's worth more than a dollar if you enjoy gambling, and less than a dollar if you intend to retire on it.<p><i>Edit: replaced a second '$105' with the correct number, $110.25.</i>",1220975179

It was a way to create great cross-platform interfaces and, heck, when you look at Firefox you can see that it looks more native than most toolkits.  But, my hopes for an independent xulrunner have simply been dashed.<p>So, the question is, would it be easier to create native interfaces around WebKit and code on that than the combination of coding on Gecko and having ""free"" cross-platform interfaces.  I'd say it probably is still worth it, but we'll see as open source programmers will generally flock to whatever is nice to program in - and with Google's interest, I wouldn't be surprised if an independent WebKit based browser project popped up from some enterprising individual.<p>Personally, both seem to fit web standards nicely (not perfect, but as someone who has been around a while, I'm happy by comparison to what used to be) and so the competition seems like a good thing - especially since open source can offer a cooperative competition insofar as any WebKit programmer can look at the Gecko code and vice-versa.<p>To an extent, I think a good bit of this is the ""Java is crap and ugly"", ""Ruby is slow and unscalable"" argument where people just like one and so they disparage the other.",1220974441

We threw together the site in a weekend and have been slowly tweaking it over time but recently have run into some growth issues.  If you have funding or investors and have growth issues, you can just throw more hardware at the problem and ta-da!  You're fast again.  However, for those of us who don't have money being thrown at us, we have to be a little more creative and start to look at optimization.<p>I've got a couple of old machines and an 8-drive SCSI RAID in my basement that I'm using for our search engine to crawl the web and process the data that we index for our search engine.  My machines are not quad-core and don't have 64GB of ram in them.  They're old and tiny.<p>When we first put http://mediawombat.com together, we threw it all together just to get it to work.  We did everything as quick and dirty as we could.  We used perl and mysql for the back-end.  The crawler was straight-forward, single-threaded, slow, clunky, but it worked.  After about 4 months of collecting data, we started to see some growth issues.  Searches were becoming slow.<p>We were using a live search through all of our indexed data.  First step to optimization - caching of course.  This was a pretty easy no-brainer.  We recorded all of the searches that people did on our site and we pre-cached the search results for the top-2000 of the most-popular searches.  This way, when someone does a search for a popular search phrase, they get (almost) immediate results.  Not too bad of a solution.<p>Just a few weeks ago, I noticed that our crawler has become the slowest part of our back-end process.  We had crawled most of our initial sites and gotten some good data back, but now, the crawler is just crawling lots of uninteresting urls and not getting anything of any value back.  We overflowed onto other sites with no flash and were now crawling sites that didn't return any useful data back.  We were wasting resources.<p>So, I was at my mother-in-law's place last weekend and she doesn't have any internet connectivity.  I was bored and needed some time away from the family to geek-out.  I thought to myself how I could make the back-end crawler and database more optimized ...  I re-wrote the crawler in C and made it multi-threadded.  And instead of reading and writing to a database, I used flat files.  I also pre-processed everything outside of the database using the old-style unix text utilities (grep, sort, uniq, sed, awk, ...).  One of those cartoonish lightbulb-over-the-head moments happened to me.<p>The unix text utilities were written in the 60's and 70's when computers were 33mhz and had 5MB of ram.  Of course these utilities are going to be lean and mean!  Perl was a memory hog and if I multi-threadded it, ate up most of my available ram on my machine if I spawned > 5 threads.<p>I read the man pages on all of the unix text utils that I could find.  I even found some new ones that I didn't even know about before (and I've been using unix (linux) as my primary OS since 1990).  I managed to replace about 90% of my crawler that was previously written in perl, to a bunch of unix utilities, a few shell scripts and my multi-threadded crawler in C.  I did my crawling operations in bulk and processed them in the background while the crawler was doing it's thing.<p>I was super-proud that I had optimized the code as much as I had.  I went from about 30k urls a day to about 60k urls crawled an hour!  To me, that was a huge speedup!  Anyway, to make a long story short, I'm still looking for ways to optimize things and I've got a long list of things to do if/when the time becomes available and I've got more time than money at this point so it's worth the effort, and it's really rewarding!",1220972465

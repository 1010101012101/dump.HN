Maybe the 2nd amendment is wrong, or a bad idea, or a 200 year old proclamation that is no longer relevant in modern times? People's attachment to this clause is just... fundamentalist.<p>And why do people insist on equating gun ownership with freedom? You're not allowed to own bombs or missiles, does that also mean I am not free?<p>There's lots of things we're not free to do which actually makes us freer: not to steal, or house break, or kill people. I for one am glad my freedom is curtailed in this manner. It means i can live in a (largely) peaceful and safe society, and am free to go about my business with minimum threat to my existence or assets. And further adding to my sense of security is the knowledge that I am very unlikely to ever be threatened, injured or killed by a gun as almost no one owns one here - because they are illegal.<p>Everybody in Europe manages just fine without owning guns, what makes american's so special? why do you need to own a gun? (yeah sure, self defence, but if no one had them in the first place that wouldn't be necessary)",1358377183

Technical people do stuff like MAC spoofing all the time, as in the article.<p>I run Tor because I can always reach my SSH server as a hidden service, even through firewalls. I strip my HTTP headers with an HTTP proxy because I don't like having to constantly configure all my browsers to throw out adnet cookies. I set curl and wget to spoof a more common user agent, because some things simply don't work otherwise. This sort of remedial stuff literally scares non-tech people, and having to constantly explain and justify such network magic to anyone who doesn't know how technology and networks work just to make them feel better is tantamount to bending over for a TSA screening because you're brown (OK, not quite that bad). It's increasingly demoralizing, and doesn't feel like freedom in a supposedly free country (Canada). I have nothing to hide; I'm still not willing to bend over like that. No one should. It's the new McCarthyism. Lawmakers and non-techs are afraid of us, and so we're treated differently, and it's becoming scarier (just because SOPA was stopped in one country doesn't mean there won't be more). I don't want to work to help people who fear my knowledge rather than celebrate it and, while I hardly think ""web apps"" represent anything like the future of the Internet, I'm a little afraid to work on much else if I intended to release it.

That source of neutrons, it's usually assumed, will be Uranium.<p>LFTR designs breed U233 (as opposed to the U235 used in conventional ""thermal"" reactors).  The people trying to revive liquid-fueled reactor development say that U233 is by far the most practical ""starter"" to provide the neutrons to start a reactor going.

While we recognize that Redis may have an impedance mismatch with the benchmark, we were hesitant to create our own lest we inadvertently introduce bias toward our system. Thus the numbers reported are accurate, but the generic nature of the YCSB benchmark may not be exploiting all that Redis offers. We'd love to work with the Redis team on a standardized benchmark we both can get behind but that has not yet happened (and may never happen).<p>In the grander scheme of things, the two systems are very different. In my opinion, Redis is very well suited for inter-process communication where extremely low latency is necessary and data is ephemeral. HyperDex, on the other hand, is great at storing persistent data.

5069580,comment,5069227,5069434,15,0,rayiner,,,"The basic problem that nuclear faces is that it's too dangerous to allow private companies to develop. Normally, having private companies engage in dangerous activity is not itself a problem. Since the legal system (theoretically) forces the company to bear the cost of any harms, the company has an incentive to take precautionary measures proportional to the risk-weighted potential harm.<p>When you get to situations like Fukushima or BP, this breaks down. The real economic cost of a nuclear disaster can stretch into the trillion dollar range when you factor in not just cleanup and direct compensation, but disruption of life.[1] A private company could never compensate the public for such costs, and as a result a private company has no incentive to exercise caution proportional to the risk weighted cost, but rather only an incentive to exercise care proportional to the risk weighted expected payout.<p>Of course the flip side of this is that the potential cost of disaster being so high blinds people to the fact that the probability of disaster is low. So the regulation tends towards more stifling than warranted.<p>[1] What's the real cost of something like Fukushima? Is it just the cost of cleanup? The cost of paying for destroyed houses? The cost of paying the families of people killed? It is partly that, but it's a lot more in fact. Consider: what would I have to pay you to get you to live in an emergency shelter for six months?

That is pretty far outside the ""VC"" range of funding since their funds want to be 'done' in 10 years, not just ""almost approved for considering to build.""<p>And the thorium folks, much as I love them, do themselves a disservice by not addressing the fuel cycle problem. If a uranium 'water' reactor leaks the radio-isotopes in the water decay rapidly, and are easily blocked by modest shielding. So that steam that escapes into the big containment dome? Well its radioactive initially but a couple of days later its not. This is not true is U233, a necessary byproduct of a thorium reactor fuel cell and present in the molten sodium leaks out. As sodium reacts violently with water, and molten sodium leak will cause an explosion and disperse highly dangerous, and difficult to shield U233 contaminated with U233 [1]<p>So when a thorium reactor does have a problem, it will be very serious very quickly.

If Clustrix has distributed the rows/tables across different machines, how long is this going to take, compared to a single-machine solution?<p>2) How do transactions work on a single table? If four people are doing INSERT's with an AUTOINCREMENT on the same table, but on four different machines (because it's distributed), how is this going to wind up being faster than on a single server? How are the four new ID's not going to collide?

One list can have a set of transformations that we have learned may apply to a certain category of pattern; the cortex will apply this same list of possible changes to another pattern. That is how we understand such language phenomena as metaphors and similes.<p>How are these transformations encoded, how do they process other patterns?<p>One of Kurzweil's examples on this model of combining two lists follows:<p>[...] certain phonemes may be missing in spoken speech (for example, goin). If we then learn a new spoken word (for example, driving), we will be able to recognize that word if one of its phonemes is missing even if we have never experienced that word in that form before.""<p>How does this help us understand metaphors and similes? Here is my own example: The guitar was made of air. Here is a possible interpretation using Ray's model:<p>- list1 is a pattern encoding a transformation which converts a pattern into one of its defining characteristics, ie. list1(air) = lightness, list1(whale)=big, etc.
- list2 here is a pattern representing air<p>list1(list2) = lightness<p>In other words, the source of the metaphor is air and the target is X in The guitar was made of X. Through this metaphor, information is transferred from the source to the target.<p>All of this is hand-waving without an understanding of exactly how, in the examples given by Kurzweil, list1 makes its transformations in list2, within the PRTM.<p>Your thoughts are welcome!

Why we assume this is normal?<p>The problem is that we don't have good enough anti monopolistic laws that would prohibit facebook to not allow to friend fb users from other networks like Diaspora.<p>So we could choose service provider, or set up our own, like we can do in case of email servers.<p>Oh, I forgot - email was designed by scientists, not capitalists.

Certainly, there are it might be a <i>political</i> solution in search of a problem, but there are technical problems around waste, proliferation, and safety that MSRs at least attempt to address, and they also don't produce greenhouse gases the way fossil-fuel-driven generators do, and have fewer outstanding technical question-marks than renewables (at least as baseload power, a role for which huge technical challenges will need to be solved before they can be considered viable).  That still may not be good enough, but there are clearly problems in current energy production that will need to be solved somehow.<p>Also, aside: that guardian article isn't terrible, but the author gets half-lives backwards the way lots of authors seem to, implying that elements with long half-lives are bad, I suppose because we'll need to bury them for longer.  It's the elements with short half-lives that are scary; they decay really fast and give people radiation poisoning/cancer/whatever.

There is also the fact that the proposed gun control laws all talk about assault rifles. That's fine, go after assault rifles but don't overlook handguns too. Last year in Chicago, more people were killed by handguns than the totalnumber of those killed in all of the mass shootings over the last decade. How can those proposing gun control ignore that?

Thorium looks good on paper, but there are bound to be a bunch of practical issues that come up that raise the expense and mitigate the advantages.

5069335,comment,5068413,5068413,46,0,tokenadult,,,"It's very easy to decry company hiring procedures. That happens all the time here on HN, and for a very good reason--most company hiring procedures are not based on research and are demonstrably suboptimal for hiring the best people. We discuss this a lot on Hacker News because many of us have been looking for jobs or looking for people to hire some time in our adult lives. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again). This should remind you to use a general mental ability (GMA) test in combination with an integrity test, a structured interview, a work sample test, and/or a conscientiousness measure.""<p><a href=""http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/preprint_j.1468_2389.2010.00485.x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2012/8532/pdf/prepri...</a><p>But the 2010 article notes, looking at actual practice of companies around the world, ""However, this idea does not seem to capture what is actually happening in organizations, as practitioners worldwide often use procedures with low predictive validity and regularly ignore procedures that are more valid (e.g., Di Milia, 2004; Lievens & De Paepe, 2004; Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999; Scholarios & Lockyer, 1999; Schuler, Hell, Trapmann, Schaar, & Boramir, 2007; Taylor, Keelty, & McDonnell, 2002). For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""<p>Integrity tests have limited validity standing alone, but appear to have significant incremental validity when added to a general mental ability test or work-sample test.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing</a><p><a href=""http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1</a><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF</a><p><a href=""http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/abstract-14602.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports...</a>",1358373980

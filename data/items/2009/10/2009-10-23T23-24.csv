They require you to take a (8 or 12 week, I don't remember) course that goes through every aspect of starting a business.  One thing to note about this is that it's not specifically tech oriented.  Each class is taught by a different (and usually quite successful) entrepreneur except for the part about raising money (which was taught by a local banker).  At the end you have to pitch the class and make your presentation.<p><a href=""http://www.incubator.ucf.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.incubator.ucf.edu/</a>",1256341416

It's nice when a commodity company, like Acer, makes something that seems brilliant, like a good netbook.  And it's nice when a company holds a streak of brilliance for many years, like Apple has.<p>What makes the HP example sad is that it's a company that has recently been running on the vapors of it brilliant ideas, and is now stuck competing in commoditized markets, where you can really only compete on price.  That's not to say HP couldn't survive, or even become more profitable; but for hackers who cherish the creation of brilliant things, it is a painful thing to witness.<p>On the other hand, this is progress.

IE does not honor the value attribute of the button tag, rather it submits the button html content as the value.<p>2. IE6 passes ALL button elements to the action page of the form, not just the one clicked.<p>There are javascript onsubmit hacks to work around both of these issues but it is just really annoying to have to do so, and easy to over look.

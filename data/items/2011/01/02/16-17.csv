If you think you solve problems because you are smart, then come across a problem that seems too difficult you are more likely to give up than if you think you solve problems by working through them.  You can't just make yourself smarter but you can work harder.<p>Along the same lines, I think I have some control over procrastinating.  Not so much over being lazy.",1293987579

Google up to understand what you are missing :)<p>Sync - I can upload my photos to Picasa, install and configure apps, create contacts right on my phone without going anywhere the computer - but that's not the difference. The difference comes when I need to switch phones or restore after an update - piece of cake in case of Android. All of the above is automagically installed after I sign in to the phone - even the apps and their settings. Can you do anything with iOS if there was no computer/iTunes involved? Can you wirelessly sync music/videos/photos - is there AirSync for iOS available?<p>I can look around for iPhone users and find many of them running the same version of the iOS the device was shipped with. Not so with Android's OTA mechanism. Android is light years ahead of iOS when it comes to always connected devices that require least use of the computer.<p>I stopped using iOS devices since I sold my iPod touch which ran iOS 4. I was referring to Autocorrect and predictive text options on the virtual keyboard itself - on Android as I type 'Ha' for example - I get Happy | Hat | Hay as the options to tap on the top to complete the word. If I then misspell it to say 'Haty' I then get autocorrect to 'Bath' in the center. As far as I know the iOS keyboard doesn't work like this and it really felt a backward step when I tried. Plus I got Swype Bud! (pun intended).<p>Ability to Voice Input everywhere is yet another thing I missed on iOS. Also the way back button works on Android. Also the multitasking is real and full-throttle on Android with no silly limitations. iOS really does feel like a step or two backwards to me in most departments.",1293987029

What other term would you suggest?<p>>>you claim chomsky could have saved 1000s of lives if he discussed sudan. i have no idea where you came up with these numbers.<p>You do know, you're trolling. Your still haven't written anything relevant to the original simple point:<p><i>A) 5:45, where he explained why he criticizes Israel more than all the other places which are much worse. ""He can influence more"", because he is American.<p>That is just not true. It doesn't explain his lack of attention on Sudan, which lacked attention from the international community, when murder/rape by the millions were taking place. If someone with Chomsky's weight had started to make speeches, it would have added needed attention. And probably saved, at a minimum, thousands of lives.</i><p>>>where did chomsky discuss sadat and the plo in the vid? can you give me a rough time in the vid? i watched at the 1:00 mark and didn't see that mentioned. i'm unsure about what i'm disagreeing with chomsky.<p>You have still not addressed my second point:<p><i>B) At one minute, Chomsky explains that there is no need to consider the existential threat, because Israel ignored a peace offer from Egypt in 1971... (Despite that Israel has peace with Egypt since a few decades, anyway!)</i><p>I'll go over this a THIRD time:<p>At one minute, the journalist talks about the literal threat to existence -- start listening at 45 seconds if you really don't get it. When discussing the threat to existence of Israel, the interviewer says: ""If you listen to what [Hamas, etc] say, there is an immediate threat to Israel"".<p>Chomsky doesn't touch that or the history of wars trying to eradicate Israel etc -- he starts talking about an Egypt peace offer in 1971!!<p>(That is both damn long ago to judge a present time -- and also ignoring that none of us know how serious that peace offer was thought to be. Which is a side point.)<p>My point is that Chomsky didn't touch the status of being under an existential threat. Then I discussed what that means:<p><i>Democracies tend to go insane over terrorism and throw out human rights (GB, USA, Germany, Israel, etc) -- with Israel we talk about an existential threat…</i> [Edit: Which is obviously factors of ten worse than terrorism. Just to be clear]<p><i>Israel is the only present democracy with [an existential threat], but look at different internment camps for civilians in the second world war (including Sweden, which threw lots of communists in jail because they took order from Moscow -- and Sweden wasn't even in the war!).</i><p>To be absolute clear: When discussing a country's behaviour, you really should consider the situation(!).

2060250,comment,2059984,2059984,0,0,some1else,,,"Years ago when I was in helping an ad-agency turn digital, myself and another hacker kept persuading management to add value in form of complementary web services (small apps that help the consumer automate or introduce information technology in the product's domain). They ran back to old school marketing during the recession, but we managed to make a few highly successful web applications that still nurture the user-brand relationship to this day.<p>The problem with some people in marketing is, that they view the emotional branding paradigm as an excuse for slacking on delivering real value. Their idea is, that you can completely disconnect the content from the image, and just paint pictures or write stories however poor the product design or actual communication with the user is (sometimes there's almost no communication, just top-down bombardment).<p>In highly successful examples this leads to focusing on joy instead of flavor (drinks), image instead of performance (cars), healthy lifestyle instead of product utility (sports apparel). However, often the product actually lacks in some way and nothing is done to compensate for it. Instead, marketers try to drive the consumption by shifting the focus from the actual product to some vaguely related subject or a fairy-tale that strikes a chord with the target audience.<p>To tell you the truth, I lost faith in marketing as a separate service. I just felt that products should be superbly designed, so as to market themselves or allow marketing to focus on the actual features of the product. In software, that's stupid-simple. The product _is_ the useful set of features. No need to add value in form of vaguely related useful attachments. I think Evernote is doing a great job at this.<p>I do understand that some product categories just can't innovate any further (most of Dannon's portfolio), so they must resort to emotional branding and adding value in form of additional useful features, collectibles, or god have mercy on their poor souls, gamification. I'm just glad software doesn't have that problem. We can just keep innovating and improving our product in tact with all the new disruptive technologies and methodologies, adding value with product design at the core, not by adding flourishes and perks.",1293984657

Little is known about whether similar increases in obesity have occurred in animals inhabiting human-influenced environments. We examined samples collectively consisting of over 20 000 animals from 24 populations (12 divided separately into males and females) of animals representing eight species living with or around humans in industrialized societies. In all populations, the estimated coefficient for the trend of body weight over time was positive (i.e. increasing). The probability of all trends being in the same direction by chance is 1.2 × 10−7. Surprisingly, we find that over the past several decades, average mid-life body weights have risen among primates and rodents living in research colonies, as well as among feral rodents and domestic dogs and cats. The consistency of these findings among animals living in varying environments, suggests the intriguing possibility that the aetiology of increasing body weight may involve several as-of-yet unidentified and/or poorly understood factors (e.g. viral pathogens, epigenetic factors). This finding may eventually enhance the discovery and fuller elucidation of other factors that have contributed to the recent rise in obesity rates.""<p>My own guess is that some of the obesity epidemic can be explained by bacteria. This would either be a new strain of bacteria, or (more likely) an old one that has mutated due to the abundant supply of food that humans have been exposed to over the last 150 years. Likely this is a bacteria that has lived in the guts of mammals for a very long time, possibly millions of years.<p>It is interesting to consider that, while a good deal of research has been done into how mammals react to famine, no research that I know of has been done into how the bacteria in our gut responds to our experience of famine. Or prolonged abundance.<p>Of course, there are many novel factors in the environment today. Some chemical that effect our metabolism is also a possible explanation.",1293984213

The design of the case meant that the DVI plug, when inserted into the socket, would exert sufficient force on the socket to permanently damage it after a few months (which is what happened to me).<p>On the 2nd Yamakasi, my father and I manually cut a channel for the cable into the plastic to prevent the 2nd screen becoming unusable in the same way as the first.<p>In the meantime Yamakasi stopped making that model (I guess 6 months is a long time) and I was forced to buy a different brand. Guess what? Same poorly designed case! Plus the electronics are different and, having very cheap components, it has since burnt out some small components, rendering that screen inoperable. I emailed the seller asking if a replacement PCB could be purchased. No answer.<p>For those keeping score: I have bought 3 Korean 30&quot; screens. Of which 1 is still working after 6 months. And that one only still works because of modifications made to it.<p>At the time, the other Jacques active on HN (Mattheij) gently remonstrated me for gambling on the huge discount I was getting vs Dells or HPs.

Faith, by definition, transcends evidence. If that&#x27;s not OK with you that&#x27;s fine, but I also doubt that every word you&#x27;ve ever uttered was the complete and total truth. Also if you can causally link those statistics, I&#x27;d love to read it. But from where I&#x27;m sitting, I see only correlation.<p>The fact that religion has been used to cover atrocities does not mean either that they were caused by religion nor that they would not have happened without religion. As evidence I point to atrocities divorced of religion.<p>I am not fit to debate the problem of evil, but my point again is that this isn&#x27;t a silver bullet for atheism. There are faiths or interpretations of faith that circumvent the issue entirely, so I don&#x27;t view it as an overly effective argument.<p>I can&#x27;t debate the aspects of the qur&#x27;an because I, you know, respect others&#x27; beliefs, but for the Biblical aspect I&#x27;ll quote something that another commenter on hn brought up:<p>>Joseph Campbell: &quot;These bits of information from ancient times [myths], which have to do with the themes that have supported man&#x27;s life, built civilizations, informed religions over the millennia, have to do with deep inner problems, inner mysteries, inner thresholds of passage.

To pretend that they do is the essence of strawmanning.<p>>I get the feeling that the author feels it&#x27;s ok to reject the scientific account\nN-no? Why would I think that. I don&#x27;t defend people who deny scientific fact. But again, it&#x27;s fallacious to think that that represents the whole, or even the majority, of religious folk.<p>>Unlike Jesus, I don&#x27;t think we should enact thought-crime legislation\nTipping your hand a little bit there. I don&#x27;t ever remember Jesus saying &quot;Let&#x27;s not let others have freedom of thought.&quot;<p>Again, I DO NOT advocate ignoring science for the sake of religion. I never said that, and your and others&#x27; persistent insinuation that I am saying this is exactly the sort of behaviour that motivated me to write that in the first place.",1383270754

6651289,comment,6649628,6649628,2,0,divinedefault,,,"Part I:  The value offered by religion has absolutely no bearing on the truthfulness of the religion.  Charitable acts or creating a sense of community by Mormons, Scientologists, or Christians do not mean that Joseph Smith found those gold plates, the character Xenu ever existed, or that Jesus was the son of God.  It is possible to have communities without worshiping invisible beings who may or may not answer prayers.  In big bold letters, the author states that &quot;God makes people happier by providing answers.&quot;  If we look at the happiest countries in the world (<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/09/business/earth-institute-world-happiness-rankings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/09/business/earth-institute-world...</a>), we see countries with large atheist populations at the top of the list...every single year.  He references a &quot;shitload of evidence&quot;, but I wonder if he&#x27;s ever taken a look at crime statistics around the world.  Even if he looks at just the United States, he would find higher rates of crime in states where religiosity is highest.  Religion does not seem to be a barrier to immoral actions nor is it a panacea for happiness. Perhaps we have different meanings for &quot;shitload of evidence.&quot;<p>Part II: This is the classic strawman section.  I actually agree with the author that many of the examples given in most debates are evidence of the evil of men, but he fails to recognize that religion has historically provided cover for those actions.  Slavery has historically enjoyed such cover.  Misogony and homophobia have luxuriated and continue to luxuriate under such religious cover.<p>I&#x27;m quite familiar with the problem of evil and the author did absolutely nothing to negate this.  If God knows that evil is happening every minute of the day, He either can do nothing to prevent it or doesn&#x27;t care to.  As Sam Harris points out, God is therefore either impotent or evil.  Every day I hear from religious people who claim that God helped them in some manner.  They regularly give Him praise for things that He does on their behalf.  I find this to be narcissistic, callous, and completely immoral when I consider that at least a dozen children under the age of 5 will have died during the course of you reading my remarks here.  They and their parents will beseech Heaven for food and water and this same God who answers frivolous prayers somehow finds these starving children unworthy.  There is nothing humble about this line of thinking.<p>I fail to see how the fact that our holy texts (regardless of how they have been translated or cobbled together) have frequently been shown to be incorrect is a flawed argument.  An omniscient being should be able to explain in unambiguous terms what it expects.  No holy book fits that description.  Whether it is stopping the planetary motion of either our sun or our planet for 24 hours to allow Joshua to finish his battle (Bible - Joshua 10:13) or Muhammad splitting the moon (Qur&#x27;an - 54:1-2), these are cosmological claims being made by our religions.  I fail to see how my inability to read it in Arabic somehow makes this scientifically possible.<p>If there is a conflict between religion and science, I get the feeling that the author feels it&#x27;s ok to reject the scientific account.  The problem I have with this is that unlike religion, science is not subjective.  It has been the most consistently reliable way for us to determine fact from fiction.  When a religious person disputes evolution in favor of creationism or asserts the historicity of a prophet flying to Heaven on a winged horse, those are anti-scientific views.  Plain and simple.<p>Part III: This section basically deals with the author&#x27;s desire to treat other peoples&#x27; beliefs as sacred.  As H. L. Mencken said, &quot;We must respect the other fellow&#x27;s religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart.&quot;  What the author fails to understand is that beliefs directly influence our actions.  If the creator of the universe commands us to kill people for imaginary crimes like witchcraft, should we respect that belief (FYI - witch burnings still happen in places like Kenya)?  If someone wants a religious belief like creationism taught alongside evolution in our classrooms, is the appropriate response one of tolerance?  Unlike Jesus, I don&#x27;t think we should enact thought-crime legislation, but if religious people cannot keep their unsubstantiated beliefs in check, we must oblige them to.",1383269723

This is something that the NSA constantly tells itself.  They have various controls and procedures to minimize the data of US persons.  They go to meetings about how not to spy on US persons.<p>I am not saying that these controls are effective.  I am just saying that they exist, and they are very visible to NSA personnel.

What you do in wars is things that aren&#x27;t very nice.  Since they are all adversaries, they act adversarially.  So it is A-OK to spy on Germany or whatever, since everybody spies on everybody.

Now we have apparent &#x27;automatic fallback&#x27; via the plugin but... boss wants it to display the image for confirmation in newer browsers, shit... Does the plugin support this? Yes? No? Let&#x27;s say no now you&#x27;re looking for another off the shelf or a roll your own.<p>Now you can say what you want about &#x27;it should just work bler bler it&#x27;s easy&#x27; but if you extract this attitude out to all areas of a software project you end up with the inmates running the asylum pretty much overnight. Like it or not, but the team or individual you are working with all have varied skill sets and you have to make work with what you have. The trick isn&#x27;t &#x27;just make it work with javascript off&#x27;, it&#x27;s &#x27;deliverer something in the timeframe and on budget with the resources available&#x27; and those are different every time you embark on something.",1383267936

Sexual tension between male professors and <i>male</i> students has over two thousand years of history behind it, and an 18th century scandal at Wadham College, Oxford led to the following poetry:<p><pre><code>    There once was a Warden of Wadham\n    Who approved the folkways of Sodom,\n    For a man might, he said,\n    Have a very poor head\n    But be a fine Fellow at bottom.\n</code></pre>\nI write this not to excuse the behaviour of the cited professors, but rather to point out that it&#x27;s a professor/student issue, not necessarily a male/female issue.",1383267888

I&#x27;m assuming you don&#x27;t like cells because of edge cases where two people could be near each other but in different cells? If the cells were carefully selected it might not be too big of a problem. For example, you could put each college campus in its own cell. But that could take a while and you&#x27;d have to drop the one-mile guarantee. I&#x27;ll let you know if I think of anything else.

Details here:<p><a href=""http://www.tommyteaches.com/special-education.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tommyteaches.com/special-education.php</a><p>(Yes, taking the opportunity to also get a little attention on HN.  Sorry, this is important.)<p>Analytics tells us that LinkedIn, in particular didn&#x27;t have good engagement.  A few strategic posts on CraigsList probably did ten times better LinkedIn.<p>The best results we got have been due to friends, family, neighbors and local teachers making a push to reach to their immediate connections (their friends, family and co-workers) to have them engage.  Also some blogs produced results here and there.<p>In general terms building an audience for just about anything on the internet is really hard these days.  Luck can be a factor, but more and more it seems to require a lot of hard work and &quot;street smarts&quot;.  For example, I contacted every host at a local TV station with slightly different versions of the same story in order to see if anyone would be interested.  Call it A/B testing.  One was, and that helped a bit (just a bit).<p>Good luck with your app.  It looks interesting.",1383267643

8231074,comment,8230534,8230534,3,0,wesleyy,,,"I wonder if firefox purposely chose to adopt a developer-first strategy with its mobile OS, similar to Stripe. I know that this strategy works, at least somewhat, on me, as I recently needed a payment processor for a hackathon and, knowing nothing about payment processors and after some quick googling for the most developer friendly payment API, I went with Stripe. Though, it&#x27;s probably going to be a lot tougher for Mozilla to use this strategy effectively in such a consumer facing product, especially when the mobile OS market is already so saturated with mature ecosystems.",1409122627

This is a method that could have never arisen in statistics, because at this point in time it has no (well, very little) supporting theory. But it works! Given a decade or so we&#x27;ll likely have a good theory but we shouldn&#x27;t let lack theory hinder development of applications, and in machine learning we generally don&#x27;t.<p>The classic Brieman &quot;Two Cultures&quot; paper is very relevant here.",1409121329
8231045,comment,8230063,8230189,2,0,ProblemFactory,,,"There&#x27;s something better than a free market: a <i>competitive</i> market. Multiple roughly equal providers competing on price, features, quality and so on benefit consumers more than the philosophical free market. But it&#x27;s not in a company&#x27;s benefit to compete and drive its profit margins towards zero, so sometimes regulations (restrictions on freedom) help to ensure competition.<p>The best example is phone number portability. By legally forcing all mobile carriers to offer phone number portability, users can switch between carriers without losing their existing phone number. This reduces lock-in to providers, and encourages them to compete on price and service instead. No sane carrier would offer phone number portability without being required to, since it only helps customers who move away.<p>FTC has decided that Google isn&#x27;t unfairly using its popular products to prop up unpopular ones so far, and I think Bing Maps and Apple Maps are close enough substitutes to not consider Google Maps a monopoly. Also, ridesharing seems to be booked mostly via custom apps, not from general map apps. But if Google Maps really was the only serious option for looking up rides, then I would see the benefit to consumers to requiring Google to integrate all major ridesharing services.",1409121322

She&#x27;s started taking the online CS50X course (https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.U_10LGSwJuM). I&#x27;m not huge fan of it as it isn&#x27;t how I learned to program, particularly I think C makes learning basic things more complicated than needed. I&#x27;m curious what everyones favorite online classes are for people completely new to programming? Needs to be free (or near free), online, and probably self-directed.<p>Also a huge thanks to the people who make online courses available for free. Despite its shortcomings the Harvard CS50X course is infinitely better than what was available when I went to school.",1409119899

Failure to send one within this interval would create an otherwise easily avoided network partition.<p>Consider someone adapting this system to operate across a restricted network which <i>only</i> permits traffic on privileged ports to traverse its border. Suddenly idle connections can be purged well under that previously safe two minute window. Instant partition.<p>Whether Linux implements the conditional to distinguish between privileged and unprivileged ports is irrelevant. Any serious systems designer must consider the timeout interval to be 30 seconds.",1409119890
8231014,comment,8227198,8228464,4,0,nindalf,,,"The downvotes might be because you&#x27;re slightly mistaken about the level of control that Google possesses. While the code base of Android itself is open source, that means little because Google apps such as the Gmail, Maps and the all important Play Store are not part of AOSP code base. If a manufacturer wants to include those (and lets face it, they have to) they need to agree to several onerous terms and conditions that Google stipulates.<p>An example of such a condition is that if a manufacturer makes any phone that includes Google apps, they must not manufacture a phone that runs without it. This is why Amazon had such a hard time finding a manufacturer for their Fire tablet/phone. As for skinning, Samsung can only do that because Google explicitly allows it.<p>Lastly, I feel that someone should have pointed this out instead of downvoting you.",1409119868

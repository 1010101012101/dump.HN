7703601,comment,7698403,7703115,1,0,ludwigvan,,,"Don&#x27;t forget inclusion_tags. They are really poorly named though, they would have been much more popular had they been called &quot;components&quot;.<p>The primary difference between an inclusion_tag and an include is that with an inclusion_tag, you can define the interface of your component with much more granularity. By default, each inclusion_tag is passed an empty context, whereas an include accesses all the data in the current context. This way, an inclusion_tag provides a much better isolation.<p>One other advantage is, this way, if you need to include some Python logic, you don&#x27;t need to do all in a single view function. So, assume that your view function responds with a page with 5 components in it. If you follow the include path, all the data preparation goes into the view. With inclusion_tag, you can basically drop to Python at any level. For example, let&#x27;s say you are viewing a list of questions and answers. Views do not allow you to attach Python code at the question or answer level. You can do it, but you have to traverse inside the data for the whole feed. With an inclusion tag, you can &quot;attach&quot; to the processing at the question or answer level.<p>For Angular folks, an inclusion_tag is very much similar to an angular controller. The primary difference there is again by default, Angular components inherit all the scope (similar to JS scope or Django&#x27;s include scope), whereas react by default does not pass any variables, you need to pass them <i>explicitly</i> as props to the children (in angular, you need to add some information at the &quot;directive&quot; level to achieve this level of isolation).<p>One alternative for keeping the scope clean while using include is to use the &quot;only&quot; flag though, so if you are not going to do any data processing, that is easier.<p>That said, the use of inclusion_tags is a bit cumbersome, and I&#x27;m not making much use of it lately since I have switched to react.js and basically building my components in JS instead.",1399372064

I can understand mixing for helicopters but not much else.<p>Mixing is needed for pretty much anything and it sure as hell beats mechanical setup. For anything of even medium complexity it&#x27;s a must. For example in a simple three channel glider (aileron, rudder, elevator) it&#x27;s so much easier to just have 4 servos (1 on each aileron in each wing) and then do the aileron mixing in software. Otherwise you&#x27;ll have to arrange the linkage geometry to get differential travel in the ailerons (for aerodynamic reasons you want more up travel than down travel) and then make sure the end points and central trim are all correct. Much easier to just stick the servos in the wing, set the linkage roughly and then trim it from a software interface. In the old days you&#x27;d have crazy stuff like left and right servos to reverse the direction of travel, now it&#x27;s a software setting away.<p>And that&#x27;s a simple example. Still in gliders a competition F3F glider will need much more mixing. You&#x27;re basically doing laps between two pylons 100m apart. The world record is below 30s, so that&#x27;s 120km/h of average speed including 9 full U turns. To actually be able to do those fast turns those gliders will actually move all 6 surfaces (2 ailerons, 2 flaps, 2 V-tails) at once, dropping the ailerons and flaps to increase the lift of the wing during the turn and using the V-tails as elevators. Then to land the plane you&#x27;ll put it in &quot;butterfly mode&quot; moving the flaps way down and both ailerons up to get it nice and slow for landing.<p>R/C airplanes are actually very advanced stuff. The jets and scale stuff will have complex sequencing for landing gear retract, the gliders will do insane stuff like do over 800km/h dynamic soaring, so you need to have exponential mapping between controls and outputs to have precision in the center of the sticks. So radios have evolved to match those capabilities. Radios have been mixing for decades now, and have had replaceable firmware for a long time. It used to be that to get a really flexible radio you&#x27;d need to spend 1000$. Now you can get a cheap Chinese made radio for 100-200$ and put an extremely flexible open-source firmware on it that will do all the things the high-end radios do and more. Software is eating the world indeed.",1399371589

Some PoC games mainly.<p>So the fact that it beats V8 on something:<p>a) V8 does not implement, \n b) requires specifically written (actually &quot;compiled&quot; from things like emscripten) JS code, \n c) is irrelevant at the moment for JS performance on the web,<p>makes it pretty irrelevant itself.",1399371109

We have a big emotional attachment to cars evidenced by the fact that the annual cost of taking taxis everywhere is probably cheaper than the annual costs of owning a car if you live in a city. NYC habitants have probably made this transition already.<p>SO if we end up with self driving taxis then this form of transport will become ridiculously cheap as the driver&#x27;s salary is now eliminated. The rationale to own a car will become harder to justify.<p>Also I read recently that our actual usage of cars is very low over a year. This means huge inefficiency. There is plenty of spare capacity per car to do alot more journeys. If we all start taking self driving taxis that run 24x7 in a few years time where does that leave the car companies. One assumes with far fewer car sales. Are they shooting themselves in the foot?",1399370585

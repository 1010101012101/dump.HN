What is there about a function declaration that provides more control over its dependencies on its enclosing environment?<p>You are correct, it doesn&#x27;t. I realise now that in my head I was not strictly comparing function declarations to function expressions, but rather top-level function declarations (like in C) versus function expressions defined at some inner scope.<p>Using function declarations at any other scope than the top-level is something I would consider an anti-pattern (if I had to use that word), since it&#x27;s very confusing to programmers from other C-like languages.<p>> With respect to accidental/unintended closures, can you elaborate on this? Perhaps provide an example showing why a function assigned as an expression creates an accidental closure but a function that is declared does not?<p>So, as I said above I was referring to function expressions versus top-level function declarations, which probably makes this question obsolete. I should perhaps have said unnecessary closures, since if you capture 10 variables but only use one then perhaps you should rethink your design. Closures are super useful but they tend be abused (yay access to everything!) which leads to bad design (low separation of concerns and overall spaghetti code).<p>I suspect from your questions you already know all of this. I should have been more clear that I was not talking about any semantic differences between function declarations and function expresses, since you are correct in that there are none, but rather the design choice of using a function expression (and thereby capturing the variables in scope) versus breaking it out as a top-level function declaration thus making it necessary to explicitly state all input as arguments.",1388652445

Do we really already know?<p>I study food, fragrance, software and other types of product preferences. In the studies I&#x27;ve done, often people&#x27;s very subjective preferences (or so we assume) turn out to be highly clustered into just one or two clusters of highly similarly-preferenced people.

Admittedly, I don&#x27;t know why he would use the word in 2001 if he didn&#x27;t know what it meant in 2008. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true.

The parent said that when he identified as a libertarian, the jargon file said that hackers tended to be libertarian (which it didn&#x27;t); and that when he identified as a neoconservative (which he never has) it changed to say that hackers tended to be neoconservative (which it doesn&#x27;t).<p>If ESR is actually doing bad things to the jargon file, we should be able to point at them instead of telling falsehoods. Maybe the &quot;liberal-moderate&quot; to &quot;moderate-neoconservative&quot; change was in fact a bad one. I do consider it plausible that it was a politically-motivated change with no basis in reality. But if so, we should say things like &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence that hacker politics actually changed in the relevant time period&quot;, or better yet, &quot;I have evidence that they didn&#x27;t&quot;. Instead we have things like &quot;ESR decided he was a neocon and updated the jargon file to say hackers tend to be neocons&quot;, which is a great soundbite if you want to make him look bad, but it&#x27;s not true.<p>(I&#x27;m not defending &quot;fisk&quot; and &quot;idiotarian&quot;. But the parent didn&#x27;t mention them. The parent made one specific accusation about ESR, which was not true, and I pointed out that it was not true.

I agree that Western Union was a bit shortsighted in turning down this patent, but one could hardly blame them for thinking that universal telephone service wasn&#x27;t economically possible. That&#x27;s like selling a business idea today that relies on everyone having a 10 terabit fiber cable run to their home. Yeah, it&#x27;s possible, and I have no doubt someone will make fun of me in a decade or two for naysaying it in any way, but would you invest $2bn in a related patent today?</i>&quot;<p>I disagree - Multiplexing didn&#x27;t play a significant role in the local loop until the 1980&#x27;s.

Lesser journalists wouldn&#x27;t have known what to do, or who to consult to figure out what to do, how to word and interpret things precise enough, and one bad step could have led to disaster, whether in terms of the story, or of Snowden&#x27;s/their own safety. People can point out potential imperfections in their methods, but today they have this editorial (on top of everything else, including the federal judge rulings) to show for themselves.<p>They convinced the &quot;Paper of Record,&quot; one with a history of party-blind fealty to power, to put out something like this. What has any of us done?",1388649710

It&#x27;s not an easy task, but so often someone is waiting for a fix, or waiting for a feature, and then gets upset or something gets overlooked because they didn&#x27;t know the feature/bug was deployed.<p>Something simple, with an app-store style approach to customization could be really handy.",1454950789

And building you own issue tracker is the very height of yak-shaving. That being said, there&#x27;s always room for new ideas. I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> a new tool but I&#x27;m building one nonetheless because the solutions that exist now, IMHO, miss out on some really neat ideas. So my side project is more of an experiment, trying to tease out some new UX ideas, rather than a utility to aid in building other projects.<p>If you need to build some other thing, just use existing tools. Focus on the real work, not the &quot;meta-work.&quot; If you think you can make headway into the crowded arena of existing solutions with some out-of-the-box idea, go for it. But don&#x27;t mix up the two, cause you&#x27;ll never get anything done... which is the opposite effect a Project Management tool should cause.<p>TL;DR I&#x27;m always looking for new tools.

They both compete for the same food sources (insects, worms, etc), and occupy the same territory (hedgerows, bordering open farmland), and badgers have the means to kill a hedgehog (strong powerful claws). But badgers don&#x27;t seek out hedgehogs. In areas where food or habitat is scare, they will eat hedgehogs. Why not? You get to take out an ecological competitor AND have a meal! Win-win for the badger. But there&#x27;s also countless examples of badgers ignoring hedgehogs, or feeding alongside each other both in the wild and urban gardens.<p>So perhaps the question should be: when <i>don&#x27;t</i> badgers eat hedgehogs? It appears there&#x27;s no problem when food is plentiful. Perhaps we should be encouraging hedgerow preservation and reducing pesticide use (i.e., the problem) instead of calling for a cull of badgers (the symptom).<p>It would be worth referencing the Peoples Trust for Endangered Species statement on Hedgehogs vs Badgers: <a href=""https://ptes.org/campaigns/hedgehogs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ptes.org/campaigns/hedgehogs/</a><p>Largely, this plight of the hedgehog against the dastardly badger is a means of using a well-loved animal to support a cull of badgers aimed at reducing TB in livestock. &quot;Won&#x27;t somebody please think of the hedgehogs&quot; is now their rallying cry.",1454949868

Newspapers can censor articles. TV can only air what they wanna air. You can chose to listen to whichever radio station you wanna listen to. Until the ISPs promise you to not block any website, they have a right to block any website or deprioritize it for that matter.<p>When ISPs sell you an internet package, a &#x27;feature&#x27; in non-NN world they would wanna provide you is: &#x27;No blocked sites&#x27; in addition to Fiber, fast speeds, low prices, etc.<p>Any internet package which has blocked content on it, and blocking wouldn&#x27;t be done proactively or blacklist-based, but rather like Free Basics was. Only a certain whitelisted sites were allowed. Any such package would be priced lower than a no-blocked sites package. Why? Because fewer people would want it. Discrimination of data also allows investment into the internet infrastructure. It&#x27;s like Facebook ads are paying for the internet for the poor people.<p>Imagine this, you find out that people in New York love Mangoes, but there is nobody supplying them with Mangoes(and only super rich people are able to afford Mangoes). You find out that the city of Chicago has a LOT of Mangoes and available for very cheap. So you take your savings, buy a truck, drive to Chicago and bring a truck full of Mangoes to NYC. The question arises, since everybody from rich to the poor want Mangoes, at what price do you sell them?<p>If you auction the Mangoes to the highest bidder, then only the super rich will be able to afford it, if you sell it at a minimal profit(since lets say you&#x27;re not in it for making profit) then while everybody will be able to afford it, only a few people will be able to acquire them until you bring back the next batch.<p>If you want to be able to provide Mangoes to maximum number of people, the smartest strategy is to sell them to the highest bidder, and then use the extra money you&#x27;re getting to buy more trucks and make frequent trips.<p>This is exactly what Net Neutrality prevents from happening. When discriminatory services are provided, it allows for more services to everyone. You think that Microsoft will be able to pay to block GMail, where as what will happen will be more like UPS&#x27;s regular mail vs overnight delivery.

This part, at least, is a natural part of the mechanism of price finding in the market.<p>It is an interesting question why the sellers are mispricing their homes by as much as 30%, but if you know anything about the Vancouver real estate market, it is perhaps not that surprising: numbers move very fast, a lot of inexperienced non-investors own property (that they have usually owned for a very long time) and have perhaps never been involved in a deal of such scale.<p>If I were the <i>buyer</i> in the first transaction, however, I&#x27;d be very upset with my real estate agent though: his job was to advise me, not to be my adversary in an internal negotiation.

The 10-year old has tons of friends over all the time from her school and dance class. They compete to see who can do the best on their math/STEM homework.<p>I&#x27;m also an employer at a technology company where we didn&#x27;t have any women full-time until employee 20 or so (save a temp or two). Now we have 8 women, three in technical positions. They fit in great.<p>Anyway, the best thing I&#x27;ve found is to just give them the same opportunities and to challenge them. For example, we throw math and science trivia games up on the Apple TV and play as a family or with friends. They have fun and it&#x27;s helped a ton with their math skills.<p>Also, I volunteer as a Lego Mindstorms coach. My girls don&#x27;t participate yet but about half the team of 8 are girls. They all love it. A couple were shy at first but it helps that the other coach is a woman. We&#x27;ve had one or two girls that were really shy and didn&#x27;t want to participate in the formal Lego matches. I casually talked to their parents one-on-one about how we could help those individual girls and we decided to just have them come &quot;watch.&quot; Within like 10 minutes those girls joined right in and did great at the matches. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re some of the smartest on our team.<p>Same thing with the ladies at work. Two of them have become leaders and two of the others are working their way there.<p>It&#x27;s been a matter of finding their talents and letting them go down that path exploring tech and supporting them by giving them CBT Nuggets or Plural Sight subscriptions. They go home at night an learn, explore, and practice.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve really noticed is that if a woman tries to &quot;put her foot down&quot; they can be seen as brash (or worse) especially by male engineers. Where if a man does it he&#x27;s seen as a leader.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to handle that yet, but a smile goes a super long way.<p>EDIT: Typos...",1454949463

If you think of logging that way, you log everything, but keep only a time-bound window of log data. Around two weeks is plenty because most of the times you need to access the detailed log information is same or next day. I think careful attention should be paid to annotating log messages in various parts of the stack with some piece of data that can be used to correlate messages that are important to your use case.

You do, of course, have choices in the cloud as well.  However, they all have a lower friction path that would naturally consolidate the current broad array of choices down to fewer solutions.<p>The hard bit is trying to visualize if the majority of non-cloud solutions are eventually going to move to the cloud, or will there always be a significantly large non-cloud solution set out there?

There are many ways to make a profit, and in fact, I have no ethical quandary with Facebook doing this (I choose not to use Facebook because I am a discerning consumer. If you want to not be discerning in your internet use, I think that&#x27;s your right.)<p>However, my _moral_ quandary with this premise is enormous. Of all the great ways to make a profit, why choose this cynical and disturbing model? Most great products help people, but Facebook does not make life easier or more enjoyable for its users. It&#x27;s really just a blogging and chat platform riddled with &quot;features&quot; that exploit its users at every turn. I do not wish to engage in such activities myself, but I won&#x27;t tell others not to do it. Ultimately, it is the consumer who needs to individually realize that these products are bullshit, not the companies making them. The only reason Facebook is successful is because its users are foolish enough to adopt it. If people didn&#x27;t agree to these travesties, Facebook would not exist in its current form.<p>The &quot;old&quot; internet made up of hackers, academics, and government types, was far too discerning to allow something like Facebook to just happen.",1454948296

11058828,comment,11055741,11056762,0,0,anu7df,,,"I think most people commenting here on India and arranged marriages have no clue what they are talking about. While some of it is generally true, but not any more truer than if I make a statement like &quot;Cops in the US are wife beaters&quot; (Translation: Long stressful job with association with violence seems to increase the likely hood of domestic violence compared to general population.) \nArranged marriages may have started off as ways to solidify clan associations.. may be.. in the long lost past and more recently for a very select few. By and large arranged marriages in India now a days is just a matter of convenience. Mostly parents, bride, groom all reaching some sort of a consensus as to whether the marriage is likely to succeed. Why does this matter? Generally because unlike (again generalization) in the western society, this is truly two families coming together. It is easier for every one if there is a bit of compatibility between families too in addition to the bride and groom. \nAs to the &quot;messed up&quot; factor in this, usually these marriages do not happen overnight. Engagement is followed by many months (to many years) of time &quot;together&quot; (not necessarily in a live in sort of way) after which the wedding happens. In many many cases the engagement gets broken off for one reason or another. There is a certain amount of taboo associated with this, so it is not easily said and done. On the other hand, this is good practice ground for resolving conflict among each other. \nContrast this to ( what appears to me, an Indian) the usual dating ritual in the US.. Mostly starts of with both parties in various degrees of inebriation, followed by some awkward dates where one pretends to be smarter, funnier and what not, followed by a few sexual encounters, after which reality may dawn and the relationship is broken  off. Fast forward many years and relationships and at some point the people involved realize that well, no body is perfect, lets make this work, we have some similar interests and lets face it, we are getting old. They decide to make it work and get married.  \nI do not generally see how this has any chance of working any better. If one could see the magic list of all the people (past present future) one could potentially get married to, with all the qualities listed, sure, one can pick the perfect partner. But till then, it is like predicting the best time to buy a stock. Who knows if something better is in the horizon. But more importantly should one care?",1454947577

11058803,comment,11056700,11058776,0,0,rocketcity,,,"There are pros and cons to both. At my previous job I had an office and felt that it took a lot of extra inertia to get a technical conversation going between people as you felt like you were invading their private space in order to talk. While this barrier to entry has been removed with the open floor plan I think it can easily swing too far in the other direction if safeguards are not added. I can no longer get 30 minutes to actually concentrate on coding without getting an interruption from others on my team.",1454947334
11058802,comment,11057976,11058611,0,0,akeating,,,"There is a strong case for transpiling if you have a node backend. Presently we use ES2015 features on the backend that wont work in the front-end code without a transpiler. It&#x27;s not really inconvenient, but it would be nice to use many of the ES2015 features in both places. Shared libraries in particular can be built using ES2015 features instead of settling for the lowest-common-denominator. We also use make in our build tooling.",1454947316
11058801,comment,11055305,11058681,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"This is a very underappreciated point. For example, in pharmaceutical drug discovery, what often matters most is the ability to play around with different modeling assumptions, and to do large-scale &quot;search engine&quot; work on different compound properties and how they might affect desired overall properties of the final product.<p>I wonder if one reason why this highly specific computational architecture is only deployed in two places (as far as I can tell) is because it&#x27;s actually <i>not</i> very applicable to mainstream molecular dynamics use cases? A lot of the business around pharma drug discovery seems to be pushing for more cloud computing solutions that offer better analytics APIs for engineers, rather than beefing up hardware for larger-scale simulations.",1454947285

My approach is to have those build-excluding lines in .gitignore file present in development branches and to comment them out in production/staging branches. So far it works well, but it&#x27;s sometimes quite confusing to other people on the team.",1454947281

It&#x27;s a fact of life that some things are less popular than others, which says nothing about the usefulness of the tool.<p>> I meanbeside BS like &quot;keeps the amateurs away?&quot;, which judging by the abundance of amateur Lisp code one sees, is not an actual advantage of Lisp...<p>It&#x27;s just that not every programmer has the intellectual capability to understand, master and use Lisp. That&#x27;s a fact. I&#x27;ve seen that myself countless times at university in beginner&#x27;s courses. Also many programmers don&#x27;t need the features Lisp offers and are happy with other approaches. For them Lisp is too complex, too flexible, etc.<p>Lots of people can learn some basic Lisp or simple Lisp dialects. But once they use actual features of Lisp, which allows every user to radically change the language, the things get tough... in the industry stuff like that is not liked. They want tools and developers which are more predictable.<p>I think you should get over this &#x27;popularity&#x27; BS.",1410130798

[0] The thing is, at present they are paid by every cable subscriber, not just the ones who actually watch the channel.

At present they only really have a handful of customers [1] - the cable companies - so it&#x27;s really easy for them to deal with that side of things.

The point is that Google users are sticky and valuable because Google keeps them engaged, and <i>knows more</i> about the users, and so the ads can be <i>more targeted</i> and thus <i>more relevant</i> to the user. In other words, ads shown to Google users by way of Google&#x27;s ad service are (theoretically) <i>more likely</i> to be acted upon. That the users stick around using the Google services for long enough to potentially see the ads is icing on the cake, and Google&#x27;s services being as ubiquitous as they are doesn&#x27;t hurt either. Whether there exist other services in the same position as Google&#x27;s has no bearing on the intrinsic value of the user base.<p>On the other hand, your argument that Schmidt&#x27;s post is &quot;b.s.&quot; hinges on the assumption that catering to users is a completely separate business model distinct from catering to their direct revenue sources (e.g. ad publishers).

And if you don&#x27;t know close enough to even quantize reliably, you&#x27;re stuck.<p>Next, the latency between &quot;user clicks a note&quot; and &quot;audio plays selected note&quot; needs to be pretty small -- think of the user above playing along with the beat... and so they click the screen, timed exactly when when the sense the next beat will fall.  If the actual audio can&#x27;t be triggered for another 200ms, it just sounds terrible.<p>The latency I notice in the OP app is particularly bad because it seems to vary a lot -- I can click a key in a very steady rhythm, and it captures a very unsteady beat.<p>Quantization can&#x27;t really fix this problem; the delays seem to be uneven enough (and serious enough) that even if it barely managed to figure out &quot;8th notes&quot;, mixing in some triplets or grace notes wouldn&#x27;t go well.<p>phon2 -- cool, I&#x27;ll give it a try when I have a bit of free time.<p>WRT WebMidi -- that&#x27;s awesome, I hadn&#x27;t seen the spec appear; I can&#x27;t rely on it until there&#x27;s better browser support (it looks like Firefox has only just started initial work on this, for example), but it&#x27;s certainly also prove another motivator for fixing up audio timing issues all over.",1410129488

Contractors, tree removal companies, landscape installers, grading/excavation firms, etc. can charge that much for work and, I&#x27;m told by my SF peninsula neighbors who have had work done, often offer cash discounts. (Which means, of course, both the homeowner and the contractor would be transporting large cash amounts sequentially.)<p>* I suspect that governments would, to a first approximation, prefer that their own citizens engage only in traceable, trackable, non-anonymous electronic transactions with closely regulated financial firms. This is already happening: cash now represents only 14% of dollar payments by value.

I don&#x27;t think these are broken, so what are you fixing?</i><p>First, it&#x27;s not just about something not working. It&#x27;s about creating tools that are extensible and understandable and hackable. Open Source is not just about &quot;working&quot;, it&#x27;s about being modifiable by the end user. All this cruft (a mess of 200 obsolete architectures, dead code and deprecated library support that nobody used since 1988) works against that goal.<p>Second, there are things that would be essential for some people, like international users (e.g proper multibyte support) that cannot be added due to dependancy of some custom methods of handling encodings. That&#x27;s not some wishy washy magical unicorn feature request, it&#x27;s essential for the main operation of what less does for those that have to deal with these encodings.<p>Third, there&#x27;s nothing wrong in taking pride and crafting finely your tools. UNIX is supposed to be made of things that &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;. Less having its own utf-8 support breaks this division of responsibility. We have libaries for that. Same for getopts vs it&#x27;s custom options parsing.",1410128142

That said I think <i>both</i> Apple and Microsoft have not found the optimal solution but instead seem to be stuck in local maxima.<p>I actually tend to use the shell for almost all file management tasks.  But it seems to me to be an exercise in futility to try and make a file manager app that pleases both users who just ""want to find their files"" and those who want to be able to organize them in a specific way or for other reasons need more direct visualization of the underlying filesystem.",1315238313

It's obviously important to the author, and unimportant to you, since you didn't even mention it once.  That's why you didn't find any worth to the article.<p>I happen to agree with the author.  I think that it's very important that all ""platform"" portions of the web are open source, and disqus is becoming a very important part of the web platform.   But it's not so easy to create an open source disqus.   The software is one thing -- but disqus is about the service as much as it is about the platform.",1315238285

People respond to incentives.<p>Right now, many people view regulatory agencies as a career springboard to higher paying positions within the large investment banks. If the pay at the regulatory industries was more in line with what an individual with a similar background would earn elsewhere, then that would dramatically decrease this effect.<p>While we are talking about fixes, one more possible fix would be to dramatically restrict the creation of derivatives, because their complexity exceeds their usefulness as financial instruments at this point in time.<p>These are the types of things that would be useful to talk about.

I can understand why, since it's what keeps them alive, but it also forces unnatural behavior, like embedding IE into the OS, and prevent natural innovation, which is what Windows is suffering from currently.<p>Now their focus appears to be changing things so that people will upgrade their OS.  This is also unnatural behavior, because frankly nothing really needs to be changed anymore, except adding more device drivers and making the OS faster.  Changing things around for no particular reason will likely annoy a lot of long-time Windows users (like me).  They are providing the exact same functionality, but are just moving things around, to give the illusion of change and value.<p>However, I think one strategy they are doing is that by using the ""Ribbon"" experience, they are trying to keep newer Windows users from being able to migrate seamlessly to Linux or MacOS.  Right now, everything across all the OSes is menu based, so there's little friction in migrating.  If a new generation of users are used to the Ribbon, then moving over to Mac or Linux will be ""annoying"" to them.<p>So I think the article is misunderstanding Microsoft.  Microsoft isn't making changes because they want to improve the user experience.  They are trying to <i>change</i> the user experience in order to preserve their desktop monopoly by leveraging their new users and preventing a barrier of entry to other OSes.  Which makes sense from their perspective because they have the money to do the research, and they manpower and resources to make these sweeping changes.",1315236443

I'm saying that ""celebrities"" become celebrated in part because whatever it is they do is to some degree baffling to most people and yet wonderful.  That which is baffling is more commonly offensive to people.  Baffling but wonderful leads to a sense of mystique.  If what Steve did could be replicated by just studying his track record, I don't think Apple would have brought him back.  That's a rather unusual turn of events.  Firing the Big Boss most often leads to deep wounds of a sort that won't close unless hell freezes over.<p>I will note I am not suggesting anyone run off and find a guru.  I'm a big believer in ""if you meet the buddha on the road, kill him"".  People have to learn to think for themselves.  That's where the magic of life happens.  That's what leads to the best decisions.<p>Thanks for your reply.  Pleasant conversation is always a good thing.<p>Peace.",1315235375

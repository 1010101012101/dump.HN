The fact you're on Hacker news / have the 2nd highest karma means that you are definitely in tune :-).<p>I think our biggest flaw is: we're not explaining this in common terms that the everyday person can understand.  It's too focused on the technical vision with the organizing and sharing.  I think we can solve it in two ways:<p>a) Get rid of the organize + share mission statement jargon. Put together something people really understand.<p>b) Show a demo of the software in action.  Once you see the software and/or start playing around with it, it's a no brainer that this is going to change the way you work.<p>Thank you for the feedback and kind words.  Feel free to drop me an email jason [at] publictivity dot com if you want to check out the product more in depth (we're beta releasing it soon, but I can send out an invite a bit sooner).<p>-jlb",1211943379

Because your video is so well done, I'll make an exception now...<p>I don't get it.<p>You talk about the problem, the pain, and your offering, but I can't recall a single thing you say about your customer/user.  Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I sure would feel a lot more comfortable with a story or two about someone's specific problem and how they solved it with Publicitivity.  Maybe I'm a little old school, but I'd really rather hear about them first, not you.<p>You say all the right things: pain (get rid of the soccer pic, ouch!), problem, product, but I don't ""feel"" the problem or pain.  I just think that a good example or two would paint a much better picture.  The more common the example, the more people you'll reach.<p>The good news:  Great start.

We're nowheres near perfect, and what the criticism rather than a simple ""oh that's great, definitely send me an invite"" response you usually get.<p>- This pitch was meant to be longer, but my goal is to really make the problem the first priority.  Quicker is definitely better. The one liner needs to be improved significantly.<p>-Normally we'd sub in the screenshots for an actual demo of the product if it were a live pitch.  We're thinking of cutting down on the pictures in the problem part showing the investor, entrepreneurs, support agent,etc.  in order to get to the product a lot faster.<p>-See my response below to TitleWave.  I hate the organize + share information line we use, and want to find something that really evokes exactly what we do.  There's a few ideas bouncing around.  No lies, this part keeps me up at night.<p>-I sense the same problems, and that's why we make our pitches available publicly.  This lets us get the feedback we need.  We know we suck in certain areas, and want to get rid of that.<p>-Glad I came across enthusiastic.  I'm passionate about the product we're building, and think it's going to change the way entrepreneurs work. We're product driven for sure.  Would love to send you an invite when we're ready.<p>Thanks!<p>-jlb",1211942356

Whenever the browser downloads a script, it computes the hash and caches the script. For any further requests that specify that hash, the browser can used the cached copy instead of downloading a new one. The main benefit here is that everyone can continue hosting their own scripts, yet still take advantage of caching.<p>Brendan Eich (creator of JS) proposes a different solution:<p><a href=""http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2008/04/popularity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2008/04/popu...</a><p>In your script tags, you would specify both a local version (using the src attribute) and a canonical version (using a 'shared' attribute).<p>Brendan's concern about the hash solution is the poisoned message attack (<a href=""http://th.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/People/lucks/HashCollisions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://th.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/People/lucks/HashCollis...</a>).

The major industrial titans that made their fortunes here in decades past (Carnegie, Mellon, Heinz, etc.) have left behind many cultural institutions like libraries, museums, universities, parks, hospitals, etc. that are still well funded and high quality.<p>You'll find some of that in NYC (even from some of the same benefactors) but Pittsburgh I think has a higher cultural dollars/resident ratio.  This is a wonderful thing in terms of raising children.  My kids think hanging out at the zoo, library, conservatory, kids' museum, etc. is a perfectly common thing to do.  I think in NYC (and other cities?) you could find many of the same things, but it would not be possible to enjoy them in a leisurely manner, or afford family yearly membership passes.",1211940004

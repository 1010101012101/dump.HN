The issue is the <i>exercise</i> date, not option-vs-RSU. Lots of public companies (Amazon, Google, etc give at RSUs). the issue, as 	\njpdoctor  mentions in this thread, is that you pay income tax on the value of stock (minus option price, if any) on the day you exercise, which is some time between vest date and sell date (option/stock-holder's choice).<p>RSUs are only expensive if they vest when the stock is expensive, <i>exactly the same as with options</i>.<p>In either case, the earlier they vest, the lower taxes are (due to capital gains tax rates)<p>The only way I can imagine the article making sense is if Facebook gave employees <i>delayed vesting schedules</i> beyond the usual 25%/yr, and so stock grants vested later (at higher market price) than they would otherwise.<p>Yes?",1328662722

You can also tell them it's in <i>their</i> interest for you to make a well-informed decision - they want someone who chose to work there for the right reasons and will be a long-term, productive employee.

3564440,comment,3562149,3563564,3,0,otakucode,,,"Yes, I was not speaking in terms of Etsy, but in terms of Stripe.  For Etsy, yes, their cost does definitely increase as transaction cost gets larger, but only because the payment processor they are forced to use (there are no other options) charges a percentage of each transaction.  It is on the payment processors side where there is no justification for taking a larger chunk simply because a number is larger.<p>One of the advantages of digital systems is that per-transaction costs bottom out very quickly.  Even if you are doing something complex (which payment processing is not), the actual cost is usually so small as to be very difficult to measure.  I work in an environment which, by law, HAS to measure their per-transaction costs in minute detail.  They quantify through statistical analysis the mean amount of CPU time, the mean amount of human-intervention time necessary, the amortized cost of support contracts affecting the software and hardware, power usage by the equipment, EVERYTHING.  And they are doing something which is many orders of magnitude more complex than payment processing.  And the result is that per-transaction the cost is almost negligible.  The same service would have cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and taken weeks 20 years ago.  Today, there's a guaranteed response time of under 30 seconds for most transactions and they cost less than $10 (with almost all of that price made up of the small fraction of transactions which do require human intervention).  These exact same cost-reduction effects of hardware and software growth have affected banking heavily.  But none of those advances have resulted in lowered fees, in fact processing costs and transaction fees have only gone up.<p>I think that it is great that Etsy is moving to accept credit cards directly.  Personally I believe the future of our economy (and this might be a 50-year or longer dream mind you) will be moving away from centralized organizations entirely.  The benefits companies offered (aggregation of workers geographically, management of distribution chains, aggregation of work itself geographically) no longer exist.  The purpose they served can be filled by modern communication technologies and software.  For that to even have a chance of happening, however, requires a couple things.  Internet access needs to be defined as a public utility or some other steps taken to severely restrict the ability of ISPs to charge higher rates to users which make money via their Internet connection, and payment processing has to evolve to the point where an individual person can accept payment from anywhere for as close to zero cost as possible.  If either of those things do not happen, the companies providing the infrastructure service will choke to death any individuals trying to make their living via the Internet.  Over the past 30-40 years, thanks to computers and automation technologies, the productivity of a single person has absolutely exploded.  The profit most companies make on a per-employee basis is astronomical compared to rates at any other point in history.  When that is widely realized, and people recognize that instead of making $35k/yr for an employer they can make $350k/yr as an independent worker (a conservative estimate, it is very difficult to overestimate just how much money is wasted oiling the supremely inefficient machine that is the modern corporation) while working far reduced hours, the need for that infrastructure will be strong.",1328662042

3564356,comment,3563700,3563700,40,0,jonnathanson,,,"As an introvert repeatedly flummoxed and exhausted by office politics in the earliest stages of my career, I very nearly resigned myself to always being overlooked. I didn't have the emotional energy to be schmoozing, wheeling, and dealing; I'd much rather have invested that same time and energy in learning, growing, and producing great work. Consciously, I realized that I was taking the sucker's bet -- that the schmoozers and bullshitters would always rise to the top, and that I'd be stuck in second gear. And so I came to adopt a mentality of learned helplessness: an overreliance on the hope that, someday, somehow, my ship would come in. I'd be recognized. My great work would produce outsized results, and all of my quiet toiling would be vindicated.<p>That day never came. What came, instead, was an eye-opening reversal. I had a very candid conversation with my boss about why I wasn't on track for promotion, despite a long string of big wins, and a consistent track record well above the expectations of my pay grade. And he told me that ""Nobody outside of our group knows what you're working on."" Note that he <i>didn't</i> tell me that I wasn't bullshitting or schmoozing hard enough. Rather, he told me that I was basically invisible to a large portion of the company. Maybe it's just the way I'm wired, but this was a nonobvious and nontrivial revelation to me. I suspect it may be for a lot of introverts.<p>To overcome this barrier, I adopted the ""win a few key allies"" strategy, as loosely advocated in the interview. I knew I wasn't going to be a world-class bullshitter. So, rather than try to bullshit clumsily and more frequently, I opted to find people in positions of power who were known to have similarly low tolerances for bullshit. And I volunteered to help these people. I made it my mission to knock it out of the park for them -- and, in so doing, to become known as the ""no bullshit"" guy who really delivered.<p>To this day, it's not all blue skies and roses. Even as a known commodity at your firm, you're still going to get lapped by the extroverts. But as an introvert, you really <i>do</i> have to step outside of your comfort zone if you want to advance your career. You don't have to out-BS the BSers, but you have to consciously devote time to getting noticed <i>and</i> staying noticed. Never assume that good work will get noticed on its own. If a tree falls in the woods, and no one's around to hear it, <i>it doesn't matter</i> if it makes a sound.",1328660323

It seems to cultivate the mindset that introverts are somehow disabled or lesser than extroverts in social situations, which obviously isn't true: otherwise, how could we have had any introverted presidents? (I'd argue to be the president, you have to have quite a bit of social finesse.) The reality is that introverts are not incapable of dealing with social situations and don't really need advice on how to ""tackle"" group situations, as one of the questions implies. As an aside, that question is what inspired me to write this response, because I found it very offending that an introvert would need 'tips' on how to tackle a group situation.<p>For instance, I am extremely introverted. When I am in a group situation (especially in a position of leadership), it's not that I balk at the contact with others or have difficulty interacting socially. Instead, I am very quiet and much less chatty than the rest of the group because I am listening very intently and analyzing what they are saying. The net effect is that when I do actually start to speak up, everyone else listens because they have a pretty good idea that what I'm going to say is going to be relevant and/or interesting, at least hopefully.<p>What this boils down to is a different style of management. I'm only in college, but my experience so far is that extroverted 'leaders' tend to guide discussion through conversation and heavy interaction. As an introvert, my approach is quite a bit different: I try to let the discussion happen organically and guide it through questioning/assent if it's absolutely necessary. And if I hear an idea I really like but feel like the person explaining it hasn't done it justice, I'll agree with it and try to add some more reasons. In other words, I only intervene when I feel like it's <i>actually necessary</i>, and that means that when I do talk, people tend to listen more, as a general rule.<p>I don't really know what method is better, and like I said, I'm only in college so I don't claim to be some manager with a few decades of experiences by any means.<p>Beyond the manager scenario, typical social interactions aren't much different for me. The real difference that I prefer downtime between big social events, whereas it seems to me that extroverts don't like that downtime. But most of that is based on my trying to classify my friends as introverted/extroverted and looking at their behavior; i.e., this reply is mostly anecdotal.<p>(I'm also not sure introversion/extroversion is so black and white, which most people tend to treat it as.)",1328659291

If Apple wanted to ""keep development and apps locked in that platform"", they could do so with their app store and still show Flash content on the browser, in theory, to keep the end user happy. The meta-argument here is twofold, really: 1) Does Apple have the ""right"", as a business, to ban cross-compilers, which can be very efficient for developers and not necessary lower coding standards, and 2) Does this represent a reckoning for Flash, which has always been CPU-intensive at its own peril, when the GPU was the proper place for its vector calculations, and will Flash/Adobe lose marketshare and CS5 purchases as a result?",1271098014

That's why Apple doesn't want to deal with Flash - they don't want to rely on a company that doesn't care about Apple or its users, and they don't want to be beholden to Adobe's schedule of 'we'll support that next year when users are hurting for it'.<p>When Apple announced location support in iPhoneOS 2.0, for example, including GPS for the iPhone 3G, would Adobe have had it ready for launch day?

She just realized that she spent the fruits of her own decades of toil to cure a stranger's suffering, and that because of the monk's irresponsibility, the wisdom gained will die with him, and do nothing to ease humanity's suffering.<p>Even if she intended spend her money to help just one person, the money would be better spent on someone who is still capable of suffering.<p>And if the old monk hasn't actually attained enlightenment yet, then the money would be better spent on a less experienced monk much further from enlightenment, if he shows the signs of compassion that indicate that the wisdom he gains will be used to help mankind.<p><i>Why doesn't she ""take it lightly"", in a Zen sort of way?...</i><p>Zen isn't about taking things lightly.  It's about figuring out what's important, and what's not worth worrying about. (Among other things).<p>Because of its roots in Mahayana Buddhism, helping everyone attain enlightenment and free themselves from suffering is <i>very</i> important.<p>And because Zen is largely agnostic towards the supernatural, including reincarnation, there is the idea that you probably only have one lifetime to (a) achieve enlightenment, and (b) help others to achieve enlightenment or at least mitigate their suffering.<p>So helping everyone attain enlightenment is not to save them from mythical torment in the Naraka hells, nor from the cycle of reincarnation, but rather to stop the recurring cycles of human suffering on Earth—to eventually make enlightenment available to every living person.<p>Story 6 is also an allusion to the parable of the burning house, which is about a father (an adult, representing someone who is enlightened) figuring out how to get his small children to drop their games and come running outside before the house burns down.<p>This is especially poignant in Zen, because if you attain enlightenment but do nothing to help ease the suffering of others, or at least transmit your understanding to someone who can, <i>you have wasted your life</i>, every minute of which is precious and irrecoverable.  And hoarding enlightenment for yourself is very much like dying peacefully in your sleep while letting others burn to death.<p>In story 6, the monk has escaped the figurative burning house (overcoming his own suffering by attaining enlightenment in his lifetime), but has not done anything to rescue the children inside (ordinary laypeople who still suffer).<p>The old woman takes revenge by reversing the situation, in a more literal sense.  Don't assume that the monk was outside the hut when it burned. >:)",1271095388

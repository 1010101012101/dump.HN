7613426,comment,7613230,7613230,3,0,hibikir,,,"Sure, adding features that hurt your stability and your chances of growth is a terrible idea. Many a company has made that mistake before, and ended up with an unworkable product.<p>We do have to make sure that, with the features we have, the product is actually viable though. There&#x27;s also many projects out there that just won&#x27;t get anywhere because there is no compelling reason to use them over the alternatives.<p>For instance, I know of a small data visualization project that happens to have far better performance than KineticJS and D3: It was built precisely because those two libraries were tried, but just didn&#x27;t provide the right frame rates for what a team was trying to do. The problem is that the current implementation&#x27;s only interactive features are pan and zoom: Not even an event on mouseover. Want to highlight something based on a search? No dice. This makes the library so narrow in its applications that the project just can&#x27;t capture users.<p>an MVP should be minimum, but we can&#x27;t forget it must also be viable.",1397915922

The OP didn&#x27;t go into any details about why they courted and how attracted they are to each other now, so it&#x27;s hard to judge the OP definitively as you did.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that maybe the OP would benefit from separating and moving on to pursue the live he wants to live.<p>I say this because I&#x27;m in a similar situation myself. I like my gf very much. She&#x27;s one of my best friends. However we&#x27;ve grown apart since we met 2 years ago and I can relate to all the sentiments of the OP. We just don&#x27;t have enough in common for a long long relationship of decades, and we&#x27;d both be happier apart, though I&#x27;m not sure she recognizes that yet. My intent is to move on, but I&#x27;m sticking around until she gets through a big stressful life change that should be resolved in 1-2 months.<p>At the end of the day, I would imagine the the OP is not struggling with her not being as intellectual as her, but that she simply doesn&#x27;t share the same values. He sounds driven, curious and autodidactic and she sounds like she is seeking comfort, acceptance of the status quo and wanting to settle down. If they don&#x27;t share the same values or at least are not at the same place in their lives, should they even be considering raising a kid together? Although I feel the same as the OP, I realized that all those sentiments ultimately derived from fundamental differences in personal values that as far as I can see are irreconcilable. I don&#x27;t yet know when I want to raise a child, but I do know how I want to raise a child and what kinds of values I want to teach them and those are not aligned with the values of my gf.<p>Remember, it&#x27;s also entirely possible that there is more to life than trying to salvage the project that is &quot;your wife, your marriage, and your relationship&quot;. I helped keep my parents marriage together for 16 years and I regret the last 7 years of doing that.

7613349,comment,7612952,7613265,2,0,asolove,,,"Ok now let&#x27;s try to write a Todo List app. We&#x27;ll have a TodoListView that shows a set of TodoViews. The TodoListView will need to initialize instances of TodoView for each item in the list, and react to model change events to know when to create or destroy new child views, so somewhere we&#x27;ll need a map from model id to TodoItem view to do the book-keeping and cleanup. The child views will be displayed in order based on one of the model attributes, so whenever that attribute changes on a model, we&#x27;ll need to find the relevant views and manually reorder them in the dom. And what happens when something in the todo item changes: do we re-render the whole thing (don&#x27;t double-attach event listeners!) or selectively change individual parts of the dom?<p>If you&#x27;ve built large-ish things manually or with Backbone, as I have, this kind of thing is about 80% of your code. Just doing bookkeeping and manually futzing around to keep the dom in sync with your data.<p>Now compare with React, Angular, or Ember. Your list view just says: take all my todos, order them, and display each one in this way. It&#x27;s the framework&#x27;s job to deal with creating and destroying, reordering, and updating those views in order to keep the DOM in sync. This ends up cutting out lots of code while producing better results, since the framework is written by smart people and thoroughly tested, whereas ad-hoc list view implementations are generally either buggy or have memory leaks.",1397913219

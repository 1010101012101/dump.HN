498226,comment,498194,498194,0,0,godDLL,,,"What's intriguing to me is that they started with less features.  I'll explain.  \nWhen some new thing comes onto the scene, like IRC or KaZaA or whatever, it is usually very shaped, the creators have a specific use patten in mind.  And so they stock up on all the features that <i>they think you're going to want</i>.  Twitter seems different (not using it myself).  It comes with <i>less features</i>.  \nAnd now, having listened to that talk, I can see that originally it came with no ""features"" whatsoever beyond the starter ""hunch"", a sort of an objectified idea.<p>That is what's worth a ponder, IMO.",1235835083

Developers create apps/modules that run on top of the platform.)<p>I was hired in large part because I have built a healthy developer community around my open source project, the Nitrogen Web Framework for Erlang (http://nitrogenproject.com).<p>Some lessons I've learned are:<p>- Focus on providing organization and growing leaders, you can't do everything\n - Success is when a community starts answering its own questions\n - Help to publicize anybody who blogs or tweets about you. This leads to more blogs or tweets\n - If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a screencast is worth a thousand blog articles\n - If all else fails, go to your newsgroup and answer one question at a time<p>Do you have experience in building tech communities?

498218,comment,493712,494701,0,0,10ren,,,"""You can't build a UI builder with a UI builder"". :-)<p>I like your point about users ""reacting"" to an limited range of choices, explicitly stated (and surely using domain specific terminology). It's a grammar you don't have to internalize, with libraries you don't have to know about, or know the search terms to find term. It's very ""discoverable"", and the limited and clear range of choices minimizes the information content (increasing the probability of obtaining the desired outcome). I'm sure it would also prune the tree by omitting choice combinations that don't make sense.<p>I think people don't like the system guessing for you, like Office's Clippy. Maybe it's OK if the user asks for the guess - like getting a list of search results; or vim/bash completion; or suggestions (google, Stackoverflow)",1235833699

1) In visible light, you can pretty easily deduce the masses of the stars if you correct for their light shifting to red as it passes through interstellar material. As the star spectra often peak in optical wavelength, the optical image is the &quot;realest&quot; for the star mass
2) When the stars have just been formed, they are still obscured by what we call dust - tiny micron-sized carbon-core particles that are annoyingly good at absorbing optical light. The best tracer for this mass regime would be infrared light, since the dust allows for some transmission.
3) Before the stars are formed, their mass resides in a diffuse (more so than any vacuum in our science labs) yet massive (10^3-10^7 solar masses) molecular clouds. They are typically very cold (~20 K) and their emission peaks at far-infrared light.",1444556705

edit:<p>The idea that penalties trump rewards probably explains why I&#x27;ve always liked roguelike games (and Touhou-style shooters).

Robotron/SmashTV style extra-fast action, that where you can never make a mistake (a single hit can end the game).<p>Also, Nuclear Throne demonstrates an important implementation detail in something that uses such a strong punishment-based motivator: never put anything in the way of the player <i>restarting</i> after their mistakes. In NT, once the death animation has played (only a few frames, at most 200-300ms), you can hit &quot;R&quot; to restart the game at the first level. No delay whatsoever.

The friction that exists around firing in many countries seems to be part of why they have less effective business innovation and investment. Companies can&#x27;t hire someone without significant risk, because firing them will be difficult if they don&#x27;t work out, and so they&#x27;re averse to hiring. Meanwhile, poor performers stir dissatisfaction among other employees, especially effective ones. This makes it harder to start new companies and grow.<p>It&#x27;s preferable for both employee and employer have the right of free association. If it&#x27;s not working for either side, just end it. See &quot;‘Give Away Your Legos’ and Other Commandments for Scaling Startups&quot; for a recent examination of this in startup hiring.<p>As organizations tend to grow larger, they tend to accumulate less effective people over time, since people tend to hire those who are less effective than themselves, rather than more effective. A counter-balance is necessary to preserve organizational effectiveness, which includes making it possible to fire genuinely ineffective people without a lot of hassle and drama. Some countries have truly ridiculous firing processes that involve a committee of one&#x27;s peers, and the whole nearby office gets dragged into one person&#x27;s poor performance.<p>Employers and employees don&#x27;t owe each other an obligation to keep providing compensation or labor. If a company is unfair in its management practices, and undervalues effective workers, then that company will flounder in the market compared to companies that value them appropriately. The problem will fix itself over time, without simultaneously saddling down fair and appropriate companies with the baggage of making it hard for them to fire their bad people.",1444555887

Marketing usually wants to concentrate everything on that one single launch event. Demand on launch day and the 2..3 days after can easily be 100x to 1000x higher than in the second week. You now have the decision to somehow spin up many times the backend infrastructure that you normally need, with the associated cost (theoretically achievable with a cloud service, but see below), even if it is technically possible to smoothly scale up against millions of players wanting to login simultaneously somebody needs to take the cost hit, this is usually when the finger-pointing between management and tech begins. Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to &#x27;wait it out&#x27;, since the storm will be over after a few hours.<p>As for cloud services: Most game-servers have soft-realtime requirements which many cloud providers can&#x27;t provide (at least with the cheap cost plans). For a web server running at a cloud provider it isn&#x27;t much of a problem if you have 250ms load spikes or delays from time to time, for an action game it is catastrophic.<p>And finally: players that can&#x27;t login will spend the time raging on the internet.

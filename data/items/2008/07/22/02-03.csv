These are the timings the author of the article considered terrible for heap allocation.  If you have to trace through some tables, then allocating objects in a loop is not O(N), but rather some much more complex big-O, which would have to take into account things like how many objects have been allocated elsewhere and the time complexity of traversing the tables or whatever.  Granted, he was wrong about the complexity here, but that is my entire point, he makes up all sorts of wrong facts.",1216695531

252930,comment,252683,252902,0,0,Bjoern,,,"Correct. That screen utilizes eInk (ePaper, whatever currently the hype word is for it). The main idea behind this technology is readability and minimal energy consumption. Next generation of this technology will probably be OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) with which it will be possible to have thin and colorful displays. Sony has developed interesting prototypes which you can see e.g. here.

Accounting for many years of hard times, that means the company did okay without the current CEO for 100 years, at least.<p>Meanwhile, Apple has <i>never</i> had a good year unless Jobs was at the helm.  He's not just the CEO appointed 100 years after the company got started, he is the <i>founder</i>.  Given the track record of the multiple CEOs the company had during his absence, it's easy to make the case that nobody can run Apple but Jobs.  Apple is <i>made</i> from Steve Jobs' DNA.<p>So, sorry, but I think it's <i>you</i> who don't seem to know the facts correctly.",1216692523

Junior-level banking averages 70-80 hours[1] per week and spikes to 100+. I lived in a ""banker dorm"" building during 2007 and saw many, many wraith-like analysts coming into the building at 2:30 am after a day's work.<p>[1] The reason for this is multifaceted, but one of the problems with banking is that it holds the expectation that analysts (a title that has nothing to do with analysis; it just means ""junior peon"") arrive at 9:00 am, but work travels down the ranks throughout the day and almost always has a next-day deadline. The result of this is that junior-level bankers don't get started on actual work until 3-5 in the afternoon.

Sure, there are some things it doesn't do. It doesn't teach you how to cook, or do your shopping, or do your homework...<p>But for what it is, I love it. A recipe is two parts - the ingredients (in what proportions), and how to use them. This completely separates the ""how"" from the ""what"" and that's great. Sometimes, I know how to make something, but I need suggestions on what the proportions should be. I like that I can add my own ingredients and find out proportions, or that new ingredients are suggested below. In fact, coupled with the recipes on the side, I can find out how to make it, and immediately vary to my taste. A normal recipe doesn't do that, and unless I've made something many times, I might not have the proportions down pat.<p>Complaining that this product isn't a different product doesn't make sense to me. If you are completely uncreative when cooking and require exact recipes then don't use this. Or if you already know how to cook something, then why do you care, for example, that ""duck"" is listed instead of ""fat"" and ""duck legs""? For anyone in between, I think you can use this to easily and successfully adjust a recipe you already sort of know. And that's cool.",1321936439

3264078,comment,3263767,3263767,10,0,WayneDB,,,"I learned to meditate by reading and listening to Krishnamurti (among many others). ""Meditation is not different from daily life"" he says. ""It can be done all day."" It's exactly like being in <i>the zone</i> that you get into when you code, play video games, run, exercise, etc.<p>You can do it better and without needing a crutch activity by consciously shaping your thought/energy patterns; by constantly focus your mind on pure observance and acceptance of all that exists in the current moment without allowing ""I/me/mine/he said/she said"" ego thoughts to take over (by simply realizing and reaffirming that those thoughts are devoid of value). The ego driven thoughts go away after consistent practice, as does the suffering associated with such thoughts.<p>Seriously, if you are sensitive to ""what so-and-so said about you on Facebook, or what your rivals, boss, friends, etc think"" or if your brain just races and races away into the night and you can't seem to shut it down...meditation is the best way to fix all that. Get in the non-ego zone and just stay there all day. And do some exercise, preferably Yoga which is all about <i>balance</i>, which is what life and your mind and consciousness are all about. Don't think about it or ""try"" or plan or obsess over how it's going to change your life or what people will think about it. Just say this is what I'm doing now and go ahead and do it without ego. It is a huge relief.<p><a href=""http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-daily-quote/20091119.php?t=Meditation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-dai...</a><p><a href=""http://www.krishnamurtiaustralia.org/articles/meditation%201.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.krishnamurtiaustralia.org/articles/meditation%201...</a>",1321936047

YOu are assailed by the smell of your neighbors new hog farm in their frontyard and the vision of them having sex in full view of your porch (they didn't agree with the vulgar display laws).  As you walk down the street that is littered in garbage thrown out by passing motorists you almost fall into a sinkhole caused by another neighbor digging their own tunnel between their house and their meth lab across the street.  Just then you notice that the end of the street is blocked off and the mailbox has been torn from its base and lying in the middle of the road on fire surrounded by a group you've never seen before.  I guess you won't be getting your mail today.<p>This would never happen under your 'everybody comes to their own individual agreements' system because the human condition would not advance so far as to have things like houses with frames, sidewalks and farms.

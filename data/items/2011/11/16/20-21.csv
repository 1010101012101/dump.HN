For example, some folks have multiple roles, covered by different unions, with different rules.  Those rules are applied to different parts of their ""total wage"".  I suspect that some wages don't count for 401(k).  And so on.<p>None of these things necessarily have simple definitions and they interact in complex ways.

It's been at least 5 years, probably more.<p>Flash was designed to compensate for the deficiencies of the web. That's great. Now that web technologies are finally catching up, Flash is no longer as necessary as it once was. That's great.<p>So now we find ourselves in a transitionary period where HTML5 and friends are able to replace Flash in almost all situations. That's great. And for those remaining use cases where only Flash will do, well, it's available on all major desktop platforms. That's great. If you want to do something on mobile that HTML5 and friends don't support but Flash does, well, you're SOL thanks mostly to Steve. That's not so great. That's less innovative apps due to functionality denied.<p>So where does this leave us? Flash is a mature technology that has served its purpose well over the years, and has started to gradually fade into the twilight as open protocols fill the same gaps it was designed to fill. Go ahead and use HTML5 if it works for you; that's what it's designed for. But why all the hating on Flash?",1321477081

It is perfectly sufficient to disable just the affected item.<p>> ... <i>creating responsive applications should not be at the expense of the user's understanding of what is happening.</i><p>In this case you are bound to repeat the Microsoft's Distributed COM fiasco. They tried to blur the line between accessing in-process, in-machine and over-the-network services behind an abstract API. It was nice in theory, but practically it was a disaster. It is really hard to write a meaningful app - even an asynchronous one - when an API call can take between few ms and several seconds to complete.<p>In case if the parallel is not clear - their idea was the same as yours - ""devs need not to know what's happening"". This does not work. Devs need to know, as do users in your case. Perception is indeed an important part of the UX, no arguing there, but the UI needs to be designed in a way to preclude them from making false assumptions that would prove frustrating and disastrous should the backend go kaput.

I've been fortunate enough to have worked in some really cool roles in the corporate world since I was 15 years old (I'm currently 24). My first job was at Majesco Entertainment, where I was a bug tester for games they released on XBOX, PS2 and Gamecube. Anyone ever play Bloodrayne, Advent Rising, or Psychonauts? These (very breakable) games were my summers.<p>A couple of licensing and marketing roles later, during my Junior year of college, I was accepted to participate in an executive run mentorship program and case competition at The Martin Agency (ad firm for GEICO) in Virginia. Wow. What an experience. Almost every employee there was a brilliant, genius individual. There's a reason why their campaigns are the most well known. This was one of the defining events in my young life.<p>At the time, I was interested in pursuing a career in advertising. By the end of the program, my mind was made up. The answer was no. I saw the flaw in the way traditional marketing (I call it 'interruption marketing' - others call it this too) handles today's world of consumers. I didn't know what the solution was, yet, but I began thinking about it and it never left my mind. I was set to see it through.<p>Today, 2 years out of college, I live in a humble section of Prospect Park, Brooklyn. I've been doing some freelance marketing consulting to pay the bills, and in the meantime, developing a tech startup that I truly believe is the 21st century marketing solution. Please understand me. I truly believe this. If you could see my face now, I'd be speaking wide-eyed and passionte. Okay, enough with creeping you out.<p>I've been working on the venture with two brilliant individuals who graduated from NYU, also non-technical (don't fret here from the thought of another two non-techies - these men are brilliant). It's an iPhone application. We've been working on the venture for about a year. Nailing down the concept, how it works, creating the mockups, revising and refining each iteration, speaking with potential business partners and reaching out to investors.<p>My partners and I have mockups of the application built, as well as angel investors (friends & family round) who are legitimately interested in providing us with the seed money to develop a working prototype, sign up businesses, gather customers and take the venture to the next step.<p>I won't list endless technologies.<p>We're looking for a hacker - cofounder or freelancer - who can help us build our iPhone application. It consists of a mobile client application for consumers and a web management system for businesses. If you can possibly be of help, I'm sure you know it. We can discuss the kinks of technologies, what you think is best and more personally. It's a reason to chat, if anything.<p>Please break through the ice and don't be shy.

(Minus explosives perhaps which would probably set off some deafening alert sound or so I would assume.)<p>This is how it went down...<p>I purchased a full manicure kit in Shanghai, China. Lots of sharp, pointed, stainless steel objects in an easily accessible case. A huge no-no on any flight I have ever been on since 911, and I knew it.<p>I would never normally pack that in my carry on, but my loving girlfriend decided to do the honors for me and by accident she must have placed the manicure kit in the carry on.<p>We get to Shanghai airport and immediately upon going through the metal detector, I am asked if there is anything sharp in my bag.<p>I innocently say no, because as far as I knew I didn't. After 5-10 minutes of looking through my carry on. There it was, the manicure set, shit.<p>I don't know why but I pleaded with them and they let me keep it surprisingly. So that's how I got it onto the first plane. In China. A dumb look and some national pride let me keep my ""weapons"".<p>Next stop, London. But not before I grab some booze at the duty free!<p>Unbeknownst to me, if you are changing planes or stopping over on your trip and you buy a bottle of alcohol on your first plane, make sure that bottle is sealed with red/identifiable duty free tape, otherwise it will cause a shit storm at your next destination.<p>So I show up in London, carrying my manicure set and bottles of liquor... am about to go through the metal detector again... when to my astonishment, they start asking me questions about the liquor, not what's in my bags.<p>This turns into a situation where literally everybody working behind the xray scanners is looking at me now, with their fingers on their radios, because I am the idiot who has two bottles of potential explosives in his hand.<p>After another minute or two of explaining my situation, they seal the alcohol in their own duty free bags and just tell me to be more attentive next time.<p>Meanwhile, my manicure set has slipped clean through the xray scanner, and I am on my way to boarding another plan, in London of all places.<p>a) Why did the Shanghai airport not automatically inform Heathrow that I was carrying a potential weapon?<p>b) Why are people watching xray screens permitted to be distracted whatsoever? They should be working on a lazy boy toilet fitted recliner in a quiet room.<p>TL;DR Causing a distraction at the xray booth, allows numerous carry on bags to get through without being checked.",1321474051

This was the first demonstration of a single processing chip capable of achieving such a performance level.""<p>Does it mean much? It means something to me, and is a great first step for those of us running compute intensive codes. They really wouldn't get far if they designed the chip only around being able to do this.<p>As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the article text is incorrect. The chip we're discussing is Knights Corner not Knights Ferry. The latter has been in early user hands for quite some time now and I've spent plenty of time hacking on it. Knights Corner is the new chip that is working it's way to production via the usual process with ship for revenue in 2012.<p>The 2018 target is for an exascale machine, not shipment of initial MIC devices. TACC have already announced they'll be building out a 10 petaflop MIC based system next year to go operational by 2013.<p>Yes, I'm comparing a chip that has not shipped, but given the perf advantage, given the tools and productivity advantage, given the multiyear process advantage Intel is sustaining, this is not a chip to be ignored. Knights Corner is shipping on 22nm. Other vendors have notoriously had difficultly on previous processes, depend on fabs like TSMC who are doing 28nm for them, and will be later to 14nm etc.",1321474032

I'd also add that there's a difference between a Mac and Windows over those 5 years (I haven't used Linux very long so I can't speak for that OS). Windows becomes so slow that it might as well just be a brick whereas my Macs stay peppy throughout the entire 5 years. The Mac does slow a tad but it's really not much to complain about. My most recent one came with Leopard and I've gone from 10.5 to 10.6 to 10.7 Lion now and she still purrs. All I use is Onyx for occasional maintenance.<p>I really don't want to start a Mac v.

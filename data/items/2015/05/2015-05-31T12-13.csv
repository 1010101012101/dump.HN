There are few production-level servers available yet, and some of the big potential performance wins due to the multiplexing, prioritisation and server push aspects -- the things that in theory could render those spriting and concatenation techniques obsolete -- are barely even mentioned right now outside of the standards documentation and related announcements. I just spent a few minutes searching to see how you&#x27;d actually configure a web server to implement customised server push for maximum performance, and I literally didn&#x27;t find a single explanation, nor for that matter a single server even advertising the capability.",1433077102

But ALL THREE pressures would be lower than air pressure on the ground.<p>> Without the hole and with perfect seal if the pressurization fails for some reason you&#x27;d have maximum pressure gradient on both panes. The redundancy of the second pane would be lost.<p>The air in between the panes would provide some &quot;padding&quot; so the outer pane would receive less pressure than the inner pane, but there&#x27;s not much air between the panes so the padding, and difference in pressure, would likely be small, so yes, redundancy would be lost.",1433076794

Social standards are changing but laws, once enacted, almost never do - they tend to freeze an arbitrary set of moral judgements in place and prevent people exploring any alternatives. As you note, would Minecraft exist in Notch had lived in the USA and a friend had helpfully informed him about COPPA early on? Perhaps the risk of letting people build anything with no age verification would have seemed too risky, yet the cost and overhead of age verification + subsequent retarded user based growth would have seemed to make the project not worthwhile.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to see any real evidence based studies that show COPPA solves any real problem.

The first couple of ranking decisions made are going to reflect those snap judgments. The neat thing about the ranking process is that it forces you to think beyond the snap judgments and consider the relative morality of <i>all</i> the characters. It asks you to do this while your guard is down, i.e. if they just asked you the relevant questions about your moral leanings, you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily give the ones you are really operating on subconsciously.<p>The other neat thing is the ambiguity of the situation given. You don&#x27;t know the character&#x27;s histories, you don&#x27;t know why the sheriff locked them up, the whole thing is set up so you read those details into the situation.

And you know where Rohingyas people actually live in Myanmar? It is at the very start of the two Chinese pipelines and the province is called Rakhine State in Myanmar.[2] So the US is pressuring Myanmar very very hard on this case. [3]<p>Two things can happen from this.
1) If Myanmar resists US pressure and doing the same things just as they are treating these people now, US can just say, &quot;hey buds, we&#x27;ve told you. Human rights to these people or they will human rights you&quot;. So any violence that might arise from this can be justified. Actually Myanmar government has been exceptionally stupid in handling Rohingya case. This mess has now become an international case. Thats their fault.<p>2) Myanmar succumbs to US pressure and grant some human rights to Rohingya(eg. giving them ethnic status, grant citizenship and that shit). Rohingya may rises and clashes with ethnic Rakhine group there to take the revenge. The region will be destabilised and this will give Chinese a huge headache for their hardcore investments.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrmeyer/2015/02/09/oil-and-gas-china-takes-a-shortcut/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrmeyer/2015/02/09/oil-and-ga...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.no/maps/place/Rakhine,+Burma/@19.4183961,93.5491945,5z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x30b0c1a60a38ad3b:0x2ef2881316474753"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.no/maps/place/Rakhine,+Burma/@19.4183961,...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/state-department-rohingya-refugee-crisis-emergency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/state-department-rohingya-refugee...</a>",1433075539

But there is actually currently much less demand than some lobbyist claim and salaries are so low that mostly this is only attractive to 2nd class 3rd world immigrants. The very good ones go to the US, UK,CA or Australia immediately. Easier, much more pay.<p>Germany had immigrant waves from countries like Iran or Afghanistan some decades ago. But this were very highly educated people that fled due to the circumstances and were able AND WILLING to adapt.<p>The current African/Middle Eastern immigrants are not willing and probably not even able to adapt. &quot;Harassment&quot; was a polite correct way to speak of all the violence, rapes and sometimes murders that are committed.<p>Do you know the country with the highest cases of rapes? It is Sweden! Guess why? Yes, must be terrible people this tall blond Swedish Vikings raping their women....<p>Australia solved her immigration problem by just sending the people in the boats back home. Europe can not solve the problems of the world by accepting everyone that comes. In Germany, one of the most dense populated countries, alone 300.000-400.000 a year.<p>You can&#x27;t have both. Free, unlimited immigration and social welfare. The people in Europe will have to make a decision about this.<p>Worse, this people are not solving their problems at home when they come but they import their problems into Europe.",1433073995

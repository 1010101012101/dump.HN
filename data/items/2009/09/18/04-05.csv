Ad-hominem posts should be discouraged.<p>The author thinks start-ups should change the world.  She's mistaken.  Start-ups are businesses, they're meant to support the owners, provide services or goods, and feed families.  If the owners manage to sell for some multiple of what they would have made working during that same time frame, Great.  That's all that is needed.<p>Her call for start-ups to be swinging for the fences is as well founded as I would be in calling for her, as a journalist, to go report on something that really ""matters"", something that could cause a ""positive"" change, something with at least as much impact as jgrahamc's petition (edit: just reread this, I am not knocking the petition, just setting a bar. I was impressed.).  It's she who chose start-ups, they're just business men, engineers, and programmers, they don't owe TC.  And besides, how does the following work exactly?  TC chose the attendees, and now they pass the blame.<p><i>I don’t say this to knock the conference or the selections we made. But the truth is I heard it too consistently backstage to ignore it.

This isn't really well-discussed on the internet in English. Best I could find at short notice was these papers (first one free, second one not):\n<a href=""http://www.kfunigraz.ac.at/sor/Downloads/SS2009/ExpVerfahren/Paper1/Literatur%20Exp.%20Verfahren/Comerton_Rydge.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kfunigraz.ac.at/sor/Downloads/SS2009/ExpVerfahren...</a>\n<a href=""http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/116327547/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/116327547/abstrac...</a><p>Basically, instead of having continuous trading (which could mean huge amounts of market data every second), they just do 30-second auctions all day long. You get an order book update, send in your orders, and they figure out who matched whom 30 seconds later. At which point they send out the next order book update, consisting of all the orders which didn't match in the last auction. Time priority still applies within the 30-second chunks. So if you have a trading algorithm, it only has to wake up once every 30 seconds ... but when it does, it has to be fast.<p>(However, time priority doesn't apply in the opening auction --- the priority for orders at any given price is randomised and has nothing to do with who got their orders in first.)<p>Of course the little local brokers loved this mechanism, and the big foreign banks all hated it (and probably lobbied against it behind the scenes). Maybe they lobbied so hard that they don't have this mechanism anymore; I've been out of the industry for a few years now so I'm way behind the times ...",1253249618

829667,comment,828992,829384,0,0,netsp,,,"To illustrate the last point, a lot of journalists love the explanation that what is happening now is a result of the change in ownership that happened 15-25 years ago away from families. They wanted to increase margins by reducing costs (journalists, etc.). The lower quality has finally caught up with these. For example:<p><i>It was a time of “greed is good” in American capitalism, and newspapers were still profitable in those decades. The old family owners were bought out by chains that sought returns of 10 to 15 percent a year, far more than the former owners had ever expected. The new owners’ first priority was to keep the share prices up, so they had to keep the profits high, so they started cutting costs–and the biggest cost in running a newspaper is the journalists.<p>There are few newspapers in the United States that employ even half as many journalists as they had 15 years ago. Yet news-gathering was and remains a highly labour-intensive business.<p>In effect, the new owners and managers gutted the content in order to maintain their high profit margins. Now, most of them are out on golf courses, and the newspapers they ran are on the rocks.</i><p>The normally insightful Gwynne Dyer: <a href=""http://www.straight.com/node/246627"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straight.com/node/246627</a><p>I have heard variations of this reasoning a few time in the last month or so.",1253248897

This is what the author thinks is happening, but it is not analogous.<p>If I open a factory for making boxes, and I sit in the front office and monitor my factory, and hire great staff and motivate them to make boxes, and figure out methods and practices that help workers stay alert, motivated and uninjured, and I keep costs way below industry norms, I will have a very profitable box factory.  Now, BigBoxMaker wants to buy my factory, since it is so much more efficient than theirs.  They pay me $$$$$.  I move to ${sunny_place}.  They run the factory, but they aren't me, and they shit the place up.  All they did was drive me out of the market, and in a few years another industrious soul will come in and they will have to buy their factory too, otherwise, eventually, they will be out of business.<p>Now, the key is eventually.  They can afford to pay me what I would profit from running my awesome factory for 15 years, except it only took me 3 years.  They require me to stay at BigBoxCompany for 2 years, but I just have to meet benchmarks, which is super easy since I already have the factory working at the level the benchmarks specify.  So 2 years of dicking around at BigBoxCompany, doing whatever I feel like, plus a check for the amount I would make if I worked my heart out for the next 10 years, or 10 years sitting in a factory, looking at factory people, dealing with factory problems.  Plus, my factory might not be successful in the long run, there is inherent risk of lawsuits, natural disaster, political shinanigans (BigBoxCompany gets your factory rezoned as an old folks home by bribing the governor, or you get EPA inspections every 10 minutes, or they bribe an employee to sabotage your equipment).<p>Finally, you don't have to sit around after you take the check.  Perhaps you should open a bag factory (you probably agreed not to compete in Boxes), and you turn that around even faster, since you will of course take all your talented workers with you in 2 years once you are free of BigBoxCompany.<p>If the check is larger than (expected profit without selling out) * (risk factor) - (estimated value of your time doing other things) you <i>MUST</i> take it unless you don't care about maximizing profits, in which case why are you running such a great factory?<p>Obviously the loser is the consumer, but this is always the case.  On their way up, companies are models of efficiency (that is why they are moving up, so this is a tautology).  At some point they are able to use market position and branding to get customers, and so they can let efficiency slip a little, so of course it does slip.  If you were guessing what an executive would do when presented with 2 options, and one option requires 60 hours a week of hard work for 6 months, and one requires a phone call and dicking around and playing golf, and both have the same outcome, which would you expect the executive to make?  So of course established companies just advertise and give out free schwag and sponsor events instead of buckling down and making a better product and more cheaply, the executive only cares about profit for the period which effects his compensation, and both methods are identical if that is your only metric.",1253248451

758211,comment,757907,757907,0,0,bhousel,,,"Based on my own experience with running, this doesn't surprise me.  I've been a runner for about 5 years and am currently running about 40 miles a week.  I actually find that I'm in better health now (e.g. fewer injuries, better mood, don't get sick) than before I started running.<p>As long as you do are disciplined with your training, your body can adapt to handle the stresses of running:<p>- Increase your mileage gradually.  Most experts agree no more than 10% increase per week.<p>- Get adequate nutrition, hydration, sleep.  Runners need a little extra calcium and iron than non-runners.  Also, you can expect to burn about 100-125 calories per mile, so you want to make sure you are eating enough.<p>- Wear shoes that fit. Your feet actually swell a little bit as you run, so you generally need to buy running shoes that are one size bigger than your normal shoes.  Your shoes should feel comfortable - it's ok to be picky and try on a lot of pairs before you find ones you like.  Also some people need to buy gel insoles or arch supports to get a better fit. If you're not sure, you can go to a running store and ask for help.<p>- Run with proper form.  The way I describe it to new runners is that proper foot strike feels a lot like jumping rope.  You want to be light on your feet, hit the ground mid foot and be springy (not stiff) in your legs, and kick back.  If you're not sure, try running barefoot somewhere safe like on a grass soccer field - this will force you to run properly.<p>- Allow for some rest days in your schedule, and take a few days off if you find yourself having pain that doesn't go away, or if you have pain that affects your running form.  Don't run if you have a chest cold or fever.  Be smart and go easy if you have other conditions like asthma or allergies.  If you're not sure, see a doctor.<p>Many people now believe that humans are specifically evolved for distance running:  <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/health_and_science/20090720_Baring_his_sole.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philly.com/philly/health_and_science/20090720_Bar...</a>",1250088861

758208,comment,756407,757565,0,0,jerf,,,"You said that when you were 15, school was a good place for you. But you are talking about your 15-year-old self who had just spent 10-ish years in school; at this point I'm assuming that if that weren't entirely true you would have said. Since the discussion is about the hypothesis that school is an infantalizing place to be, saying that when you were 15 school was the right place to be is begging the question. If you had been in a hypothetical better environment, your 15-year-old self might have been much more capable of dealing with real challenges.<p>You don't ""say"" it. The idea that school is the only way a childhood can be is so deeply ingrained in your argument you can't even <i>perceive</i> it. It's such a given that you consider it a logical axiom, and you end up arguing circularly without even realizing it, you and about half the other posters in this discussion.<p>Your last sentence would seem to me to reinforce the point. Maybe school can be ""improved"", but the idea that it is potentially fundamentally flawed doesn't seem to be thinkable. Mind you, I'm not saying that you (and others) think the idea, then reject it (which if done properly would be perfectly valid); people don't seem to be even capable of <i>thinking</i> the idea.<p>Your picture of maturity is shaped by the system under question.<p>Again, I'm not actually attacking or defending the schools here.

I would not call their new system streamlined, and as I have been told from time to time that their database is down I am curious how it could be using XML on the backend.  Is XML over HTTP part of their patent?  If the patent is for XML in Word, well, Word is not even in that web-based workflow.  Further, and this is just a nit-pick I realize that the guy may have misspoken.

In some ways it's less disconcerting to see a guy drinking a Coke than drinking Unspecified-Beverage-In-A-Vaguely-Red-Can-With-Electrical-Tape. I also have a hard time imagining that even a quite popular show could survive having the characters in the show repeatedly directly shill for a product, long before we even approach the level of ads television or radio used to carry directly. While I've used television terminology, I think this carries across all media.<p>Any sort of recurring program (TV-like video, blog, newspaper, etc) spend credibility when they do that, unless they are very carefully ensuring that they only talk about products they care about personally, which only works for things that <i>are</i> personal productions.

Therefore, I feel as if flagging is an action whereas starring is favoriting/liking an item.<p>Other sites, like digg, are just community dumping grounds in which moderation is necessary. There, flagging is a notification to an admin and starring would be more appropriate for a positive response (for action, favoriting, etc).<p>I guess, what I am trying to say is - if moderation is necessary, if there is the need for a negative connotation, then the flag feels that way. But, if there is no need for a negative connotation (like my email or Twitter, which don't require moderation) then a flag doesn't feel bad at all, it just feels important.",1250088193

Quite where I have suggested any form of backwardness (???) is a bit of a mystery - you've made an assumption I think (my fault: I was too objective in the original statement). I also call bull shit. There are lots of ""backwards"" people in the world irrespective of culture. No more or no less in Eastern countries. I cant believe you would suggest as much!<p>There actually is an important difference: but not the one you identified. It is to do with Stigma. In Europe especially there is a HUGE stigma about suicide. In 1910 it was even more so. There was almost certainly terror but the suicide rate was lower (if not almost non-existant) because doing so was bad.<p>I've noticed that stigma is less apparent (but not, note, non-existent) in some parts of Asia. This I would suggest identifes<p>> A lot of people live in slums, and these are more likely to catch the virus once it has spread.<p>You make a superb point and I agree. I havent seen ""on the ground"" but it would be interesting to see the reactions of those living in slums compared to, say, middle class business men. From previous observations I would suspect that a more ""hysterical"" reaction would be in the business persons with the others taking a more liberal view.<p>And note we are talking about panic: which is a bad thing in these circumstances. If it is, as you say, confined to those coming from abroad then mass panic seems overkill.

A lot of the media hype has met with cynicism. There was some hoarding of Tammiflu but that died off very quickly when people weren't really dying of it.

That's dodgy at best - telling doctors what a drug does seems like a very good thing.  Telling consumers that there's a drug that might help with a problem that they have seems like a good thing.  (They may not be talking to a doctor about it.)<p>However, let's go with ""it just increases the numbers of people using it"".  If you're someone who needs that drug, increasing the number of people means that other people are helping to pay for the fixed costs.  Since the ""good"" fixed costs are rather high, that's a good thing for you.<p>> They abuse the patent system left, right and center in order to extend the income from so called 'blockbuster' drugs at the expense of doing something innovative for a smaller group of people.<p>(1) There's no such connection.
(2) What's stopping you from producing said ""innovation""?<p>A lot of people are quite fond of criticising other people for not doing some ""easy"" good, yet the critics don't bother to provide said good.<p>This is interesting, because the domain is almost always one where ""good"" comes with fairly large financial rewards.  If the critics are correct, they're not doing an easy good that would both provide them with considerable money (which they could use to do more good) and drive bad people out of biz.",1250085848

This is largely incompatible with the notion of covering a large amount of material which you need to regurgitate near-verbatim in an exam.  That kind of environment essentially reduces any subject to a memory recall game.  I decided I wanted to come away with a very rich understanding of fewer things, and my exam grades mattered less to me.<p>So, it's not like I didn't go to <i>any</i> classes.  I just didn't go to any which didn't really increase my understanding.  If it was the sort of thing I could just read out of the text book and memorise, then I would do that instead of wasting my  time sitting in a lecture.  Instead, I worked on projects (both credit and non-credit varieties).  I went and sat in the computer science tea room with a stack of papers and I just read them.  I asked academics about things that I read and didn't understand.  The most common answer was usually ""Hrm.  That <i>is</i> interesting.  I don't know the answer to that, but there's a paper by so-and-so that might explain it!"" - result!  Print another paper and head back to the tea room.<p>After two or so years of this, I had a pretty darned good foundation in my sub-field of computer science.  Enough that I managed to work on some novel projects, which I wrote up and published in my fourth year.  By my third year I had managed to convince the department to drop a bunch of course requirements in favour of letting me do a project worth an equivalent number of credits.  I actually did all of this <i>in the lecture time slots</i>.<p>The alternative would have been sitting through introduction to {programming, algorithms, self-harm} for years, getting bored, and probably just dropping out to go earn real money cutting code.<p>So really, who got the better deal?  My classmates who digested the material at exactly the rate it was delivered?  I think I got the better deal, because I actually made full use of being in a university environment.<p>And as I said, I believe <i>that</i> was what got me into a very good PhD programme.  I got my money's worth.<p>So, skipping classes is fine as long as you are willing to take responsibility for your own education.",1250085745

While 325k people here might die of malaria every year, nobody in my friend of friends and in their extended family has died of malaria in recent times.  All of them know exactly what to do if they caught malaria and how to avoid getting it in the first place.  Right now, none of them would know what to do if they caught swine flu.  Also, in this sample, statistically speaking, everyone probably has more of a chance of dying of swine flu rather than malaria (even though both the chances are pretty much negligible).<p>All I am saying is that that comparison to malaria was a bit misleading.",1250085702

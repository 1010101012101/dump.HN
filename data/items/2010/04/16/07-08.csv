1270019,comment,1269689,1269841,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You are correct, but the basis of the rejection is fundamentally flawed. Simply reusing the likeness or identity of a public figure (eg in a sliding tile game) is potentially an infringement on the person's right to publicity, as well as possibly the originator of the image if it involves commercial photography. Partaking in any profits from such an app would expose Apple to liability and is justifiably avoided.<p>However, the parodic nature of cartooning, and especially political cartooning (of figures who hold public office), is very strongly protected by the first amendment and masses of legal precedent, or newspapers would be getting sued right and left. Liability is not an issue here, as evinced by the ability of editorial cartoonists to freely ply their trade in newspapers (many examples of which, from large publishers, exist on the iPxx).",1271403806

I take part in one large political internet forum (for reasons that are increasingly unclear to me...) where this kind of up/down system was tried, albeit with uncapped totals.<p>Prior to that users could only recommend posts, and the mechanism was transparent enough that members of a faction would cross-promote each others' posts and employ many other 'turf war'-like tactics to maintain mindshare. After up/down voting was introduced about a year ago, a majority of members prefer it while 25% or so complained bitterly about censorship and all the usual cliches. Flamebait or outright stupidity is now downvoted fairly quickly, but turf wars persist and a negative response to a new thread is frequently seized on as an excuse to start a mini-thread about 'downvoting trolls' and use said 'discussion' to keep the thread alive despite its poor reception by a majority.<p>Anecdotal to be sure, but with about 2m monthlies and a year's worth of observation (plus umpteen meta-polls, since every community enjoys gazing at its own navel) the trend is pretty obvious.

What Apple has created with the iPhone and iPad is actually perfect for ""regular users"". For my mom, for my grandmother. Even for my dad, who is just too busy these days to configure computers and phones, who easily has the knowledge and skill to do so. The ability of these people to do powerful things without having to spend time working on it is actually quite interesting.<p>I am completely turned off by the direction computing is taking, but people who think this is just a fad are wrong, and aren't looking at the big picture. People buy Apple products because it gives them what they want. Yes, Linux is much superior to OS X and Windows, but the majority of users don't not use it because of some FUD, its because they don't have the time or skill to work with it. Apple is taking that concept to the next level, where <i>anyone</i> can accomplish things in a much easier way.<p>This won't go away. Apple is being extremely successful, and I see  many other companies who are going to jump on the bandwagon. But for us power users, there will always be the hardware that we are used to buying available. Linux is not going to go away. There is just going to be a bigger divide between what your nontechy family and friends use, and what you use. I don't know whether or not this will destroy the next generation of programmers, who won't have had the ability to tinker. I can see that happening. But really, this is not going to be a negotiable thing. This isn't something you can fight against. This is the way technology is moving. We have to adapt to it, not the other way around.",1271402850

It's not an open market, and is not intended to be.<p>I'm hoping that once people get this, the moral outrage (and all of the articles about the moral outrage) will die down.<p>Applications that are in violation of the TOS are going to be rejected by the App Store.  That means they have to be written in the language that Apple specifies, and meeting the content standards that Apple specifies.  If there's content that in ""Apple’s reasonable judgment may be found objectionable"", you're out of luck.<p>And, of course, it's well within Apple's rights to keep the leash so tight, just as Disney can tightly control which goods and services are offered within the confines of their theme parks.

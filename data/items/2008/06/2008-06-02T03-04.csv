206423,comment,206304,206374,0,0,flashgordon,,,"Totally agree.  Case in point.  Up until highschool I was very good at math.  Mainly because I would actively seek out books and try to solve problems where ever I could find them.  As soon as I started Uni, my interest dwindled (was replaced by love for all things CS).  People who I had dominated back in highschool were now getting a good 10-20% higher than me.  All in practise I think.",1212378836
206421,comment,206107,206249,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Avi, you guys are seriously going to open up the stuff that's above the VM?  I had been thinking about again picking up my own project to put Ruby on top of Smalltalk.  I'm envious of your approach with working with the VM hackers to get custom bytecodes.  This would be great for getting Ruby to run fast.<p>What of parallel projects on other Smalltalk VMs?  It would be good for the Ruby community to have options.  Gemstone might want to keep some sort of competitive advantage, however.  (Email this userid at yahoo.com.  Linkedin is not letting me send you a message, and so fulfilling their policy of keeping out riff-raf.)",1212378613

206417,comment,205937,205937,0,0,jexe,,,"Definitely check the TOS of the sites you plan to scrape.    Some data, in particular factual data, isn't copyrightable, but that doesn't necessarily give you the rights to automatically collect it from any place you can find it. Businesses spend a lot of money and time collecting and hosting data, so they can  get pretty particular about how you're allowed to use their service.<p>Here's an excerpt from the yellowpages.com TOS.  Without it, their company names, addresses, and phone numbers would be more or less fair game for any competitor:<p>""You are prohibited from data mining, scraping, crawling, or using any process or processes that send automated queries to the YELLOWPAGES.COM Web site. You may not use the YELLOWPAGES.COM Web sites to compile a collection of listings, including a competing listing product or service.""",1212378172

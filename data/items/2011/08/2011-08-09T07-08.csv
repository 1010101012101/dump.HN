And that's for something as tangible as a car, listed on the market with easily searched prices. This is a simple example, but I recall that some types of assets (land?) are valued at their original purchase price, which is far deflated from the current market value.<p>I think of accounting similar to benchmark tools for software -- it's all about what you want to measure, and depending on assumptions you have some wiggle room.",1312876657

If you're reading from a file with mmap(), the page cache just appears in your address-space, no copying necessary.<p>On the other hand, I was curious why the default had changed from ""use mmap"" to ""don't use mmap"".

2863270,comment,2861277,2863162,1,0,TheSkeptic,,,"AirBnB's guarantee doesn't affect this at all. Here's an example:<p>You rent an apartment and have a standard lease that forbids subletting. You travel a lot on business and decide to rent out your apartment for $150/night five days a month anyway. That's $750/month, or $9,000/year, in your pocket pre-tax. Not bad, but....<p>One day, you rent to an individual who happens to be a heavy drug user with a criminal record. You don't know this because you didn't perform any due diligence.<p>When your guest is confronted by one of your neighbors about a noise issue, he brutally assaults your neighbor. During the assault, your neighbor suffers major head trauma and is rushed to the hospital, where he undergoes emergency surgery in an attempt to save his life. Following the surgery, he is comatose and if he recovers at all, will require months if not years of rehabilitation. In the best case scenario, the doctors believe he will likely have some permanent brain damage that may prevent him from living a full, productive life.<p>When it comes to light that you were violating the terms of your lease and renting your apartment to complete strangers in exchange for money without doing any real due diligence on your guests, it's very likely you'll be sued by the victim's family. Needless to say, given the amount of damages you may owe if you're not successful in defending yourself, you're going to need a great lawyer. They don't come cheap. AirBnB's $50,000 guarantee? That only applies to damage due to vandalism or theft, but even if it applied to everything, won't even cover the cost of the victim's initial surgery.<p>Obviously, this is an extreme example, but it's well within the realm of possibility. There are plenty of other scenarios, less extreme, under which an individual could conceivably be personally liable for damages far in excess of what they will ever make using AirBnB, and far in excess of what AirBnB says it will cover.<p>By the way, AirBnB's guarantee is almost certainly not an insurance policy, even though the company (intentionally or unintentionally) is going to confuse people who don't understand the difference between a guarantee and an insurance policy.<p>As far as I know, AirBnB is not registered as an insurance company in any state, and I doubt very much that a legitimate insurance company would sell a policy for most AirBnB rentals without, at the very minimum, proof that the host has the authority to sublet and that he or she is not violating any local ordinances that apply to rentals and hotels.",1312875219

Perhaps not a bad thing? Except they are probably just poor individuals who were too lazy to think about finances for themselves. The first thing I learned about investing is ""don't invest in anything you don't understand"", which pretty much excludes complicated investments constructs, and is not that hard to digest.<p>But what would be the solution? Forbidding ""gambling"" to individuals would possibly result in communism, as it would imply the state would have to dictate the investments.",1312875051

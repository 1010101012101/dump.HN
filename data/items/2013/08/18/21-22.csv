6234434,comment,6233528,6234319,0,0,winter_blue,,,"> <i>Learning Hindi would mean learning a totally new language for the majority of Indians. Many would rather learn English as a second language.</i><p>For most North Indians (speakers of Indo-Aryan languages), Hindi would probably be a lot easier to pick up than English. On top of that, they get to interact with a large population of fluent Hindi speakers, and get really good at it, to the point of it (potentially) being a language spoken at home.<p>I&#x27;ve been in Bangalore, and the English of the majority of programmers I&#x27;ve met here is utterly atrocious. They butcher sentences and are incapable of constructing a single grammatical sentence. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t criticize them if this hadn&#x27;t been coupled with appallingly bad coding skills.<p>One solid reason to promote Hindi is this. They can <i>actually</i> get good at the language. Hindi is also much more likely to transition into becoming their home language than English.",1376863186
6234433,comment,6233133,6234306,4,0,VLM,,,"I would imagine the doppler effects of beaming a couple watts at a low freq thru a ceiling fan would be humorous.<p>Another interesting one is phase noise and distortion and crossover distortion (if you use a simple class-B amp) means you can send a sine wave into a high power amp, but the amplified noise level at audible range might be icky.  As a personal anecdote I&#x27;ve noticed this with commercial ultrasonic cleaners.  Sure... noise level might be 30 dB down at audible range, but pump a 100 watts at 40 KHz into it and I&#x27;m listening to 0.1 watts of noise at audible freqs which is quite loud indeed.  Theoretically ultrasonic cleaners should be inaudible, but high powered ones are not.  Much as intermod distortion is hilarious with high power RF, noisy/corroded/semi-faulty ultrasound could be loud as heck acoustically thru no fault of the generator, amp, or transducer.",1376863182

There they confute all opinions, and boldly they may do it, for as much as no liberty of reply or vindication in public is allowed to any, though never so much scandalized by them.

It&#x27;s easy, useful and satisfying (if you have a userbase).<p>An example. I love checking the EXIF data of the pictures on the internet to know more about how they were shot. I use Jeffry Friedl&#x27;s Exif Viewer (<a href=""http://regex.info/exif.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://regex.info/exif.cgi</a>). The process was: right click on the image, open in new tab, click a bookmarklet, new tab opens with the exif. Then, I decided to create a super simple Chrome extension that adds an option to the context menu of all images that opens the image in the exif viewer.<p>You can check the (minimal) code here <a href=""https://github.com/JoseTomasTocino/send-to-exif-viewer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/JoseTomasTocino/send-to-exif-viewer</a>, as well as the link to the chrome web store <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-jeffreys-exif-vie/gogiienhpamfmodmlnhdljokkjiapfck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-jeffreys-e...</a>",1376859900

6234228,comment,6232073,6233824,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"I always recommend people use PostGIS and used it myself for many years but it was behind Oracle in significant ways even though Oracle is not that great. In recent versions of PostGIS, most users won&#x27;t notice the differences. Oracle still scales marginally better.<p>Most importantly, Oracle has always had a better geometry engine that PostGIS, though that gap has closed significantly. It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that proper geodetic models were not supported at all. And last I knew the current PostGIS does not do pure geodetic for all operations (or so I&#x27;ve heard from the guys who wrote the geodetic geometry engine for my company). Oracle also supports a variety of related data types, operations, and indexes that are useful.<p>The only platform that currently offers scalability and throughput for geospatial data models is SpaceCurve, of which I am the founder. Among other things, it supports continuous online indexing at a rate of millions of geodetic polygons per second concurrent with queries on petabyte-scale data models. The technology was originally developed for building real-time sensor-fused models of the planet, though it is much more general now.",1376859771

But there&#x27;s a lot of differences in incentives, capabilities, tradeoffs, calculations and so on between them all.  If you are really interested in understanding the world, rather than making the point that THE GUBERMENT IS EEEVIL, thinking about some of these differences would behoove you.<p>So: are you genuinely so poorly informed that you see no difference, or are you completely blinded by your libertarian propaganda as to not see any difference?<p>I live in Italy, and like many people, I intensely dislike Berlusconi.

That message is stunning propaganda.<p>Sure, I could give someone a dollar and that person could use it to buy a small portion of their last hit of heroin which finally ends up killing that person.<p>This message is saying that I am responsible (at least partially) for that person&#x27;s death.<p>The bigger causes of that person&#x27;s death is that this person is a heroin addict, and something caused this person to be a heroin addict, and that someone is selling heroin, and that someone is making heroin, and so on and so on....<p>When you account for all the causal factors that led to that person&#x27;s death, this one dollar is just the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back.

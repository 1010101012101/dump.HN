7697706,comment,7696941,7697530,7,0,DavidWoof,,,"First, you don&#x27;t get to choose your signalling.  Anyone can double their prices and put a sign in the door, why would the public trust that?  More importantly, if you raise prices to lower demand, the public will <i>accurately</i> see that as lowered demand.  If you&#x27;re nothing special at a doubled price, then you&#x27;re nothing special.<p>I&#x27;ll admit though, I think Becker is mostly wrong here.  One reason restaurants don&#x27;t triple their prices to clear excess is fear that the public would call it &quot;gouging&quot; and react extremely negatively, thus eliminating any chance of long-term success.  Also, there&#x27;s a huge difference between a hot new restaurant and the restaurant that has lines out the door every day for years, a difference Becker ignores.<p>I find a lot of &quot;popular&quot; Becker is like this, especially the famed work on discrimination.  Brilliant math, genuine insights, but skips over essential variables when reaching his conclusions, making the final result dubious.",1399283718

7697697,comment,7694612,7695744,1,0,userbinator,,,"A modern PC actually has several clock crystals; there&#x27;s usually at least a high-frequency one that generates the main CPU/chipset clock, and a much lower frequency one (32.768KHz) for the realtime/battery-backed clock. On the motherboard I&#x27;m currently using I see two more, one for the Ethernet chip and another on the audio codec. They would all drift somewhat with temperature, but I think for this system at least, using the RTC clock for coarse timing would probably have the least temperature variance as it&#x27;s far away in a corner of the board and at the bottom, away from any heat-producing components.<p>I suppose you could also use some sort of GPS-disciplined oscillator too.",1399283567

7697630,comment,7697132,7697435,2,0,jgraham,,,"There is Opera Critic [1], which was originally developed for working on the Opera web browser and subsequently open-sourced. I have used it (with a few patches) in conjunction with GitHub to fix many of the issues that are mentioned in the article. In particular it has the following features:<p>* Works with git. There isn&#x27;t any VCS abstraction so if you want to use it with mercurial or whatever you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>* The review tool (typically) owns the repository that code is pushed to (obviously this is a bit different when integrated with GitHub). Starting a review is typically something like &quot;git push critic branch:r/branch&quot;.<p>* Because reviews are just branches you get all the features that the VCS implicity provides but patch based systems have to replicate (e.g. interdiffs) for free.<p>* Because reviews are just branches, multiple people can push to the same review so if you want e.g. a database expert to make the database changes for a particular change that is otherwise mostly written by a UI expert, that&#x27;s possible.<p>* Assignment to reviewers is based on filters i.e. the tool picks the right reviewer for each change. There may be more than one reviewer for different parts of a single review request (e.g. where you have different owners for the database and ui code and a patch touches both those parts will be reviewed by different people). Reviews can be assigned to specific individuals when required.<p>* Review progress is tracked per commit and per file, so you can do long reviews in pieces rather than all at once.<p>* When issues are raised on particular lines of code it optimistically assumes that any subsequent push that touches those lines addresses the issue. If it wasn&#x27;t addressed the reviewer reopens the issue. This works surprisingly well in practice.<p>* Rebases of the review branch are handled through &quot;equivalent merge commits&quot;, which means that you retain all comments and progress from before the rebase.<p>* the UI is generally very &quot;engineer designed&quot; and won&#x27;t win any beauty contests. But it has essential features that some other tools inexplicably lack, such as side-by-side diffs and syntax highlighting.<p>[1] <a href=""https://critic-review.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://critic-review.org</a>",1399281706

7697588,comment,7696200,7696913,6,0,mantrax5,,,"Well Siri isn&#x27;t female (and &quot;Siri&quot; as a name isn&#x27;t a girl or boy name per se), its voice gender varies depending on the country. Apple uses the highest quality voice they have as the default. If you ask Siri what&#x27;s its gender, it famously replies &quot;I haven&#x27;t been assigned a gender&quot;.<p>Even then though, female voice usually wins for phone voice services. Why?<p>Turns out males voices are more &quot;lossy&quot; over plain-old-telephone-service and over tiny tinny speakers (like on the iPhone).<p>The frequency range of a female voice maps to less loss in this speaker/service range compared to a deep male voice, where the lower frequencies get lost. So female voices are easier to understand in such circumstances.<p>This explains in part why OSX has a male voice, because a Mac comes by default with much better speakers than a phone does. Even then deeper voices are still not preferred. The &quot;in a time...&quot; movie trailer voice isn&#x27;t coming to an AI assistant any time soon.<p>As for Cortana, the basically nude Halo AI bimbo, you have a point there, awkward choice for a commercial product, but that&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s problem. They&#x27;ve always had awkward marketing/branding choices, so this fits in.<p>As for Betty, &quot;Betty the secretary&quot; reference is quite obvious, but as a personal project, I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s forgiven.",1399280853

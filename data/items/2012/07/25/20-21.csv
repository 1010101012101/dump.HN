Really? I think those claims would need better substantiation. Looking back we have a 20/20 hindsight and maybe can say where we took the wrong turn. But can you point out to other budding and promising theories that Chomsky somehow squashed because of, I don't know, his great power or character.<p>As for politics. Can you explain better and provide some more information. So far it seems, this is just you disagreeing with his politics and then attacking his influence on linguistics as an obvious extension of his political views.<p>>  I think it's time to retire and the ""old guard""!<p>No. You retire, theories that have been proven wrong and bring about theories that explain the reality in a better, more complete, or universal way. You don't retire the ""old guard"" because you disagree with their food tastes or politics (which seems to be in this case)",1343249924

You combined prior experiences, refined them, and over time solidified them into new constructs which you then used to repeat the process for higher level concepts. Visual light and dark blobs become coherent shapes which get associated with meaning and eventually those meanings get associated with names like 'chair' or 'rabbit.'<p>Content access: A top down (and sideways) lookup.<p>In many cases we know what we want without bothering to think of the name. Being thirsty may mean you think 'glass','faucet','stream','bubbles', and 'water.' But you don't have to think any of those words to get a glass of water and take a drink.<p>Unfortunately in much of IT there is a textual interface so you first have to pick a starting word and then use that to find what you're looking for. Any time you think of a word it is physically connected to many other notions, memories, experiences, and other words built over a lifetime of experience.<p>When we try to describe what something <i>is</i> we access the hierarchy we have learned. A chair is a piece of furniture, which is a solid object, which is something I can touch. We may even use this description to create a hierarchical description.<p>The tension here is that how we describe things is at best a very limited subset of how our brain connects to information about that thing. These mappings differ from person to person and change over time. One system of hierarchical categorization cannot be intuitive to all people and probably won't be to the same person after 10 years.<p>IMNSHO The only interface which will 'just work' for organizing labeled objects is one that <i>knows you</i>. The best example of this is Google's one box which searches my computer, builds associations between content that are not directly related to the search terms I use, and modifies itself over time based on my behavior.",1343249585

Remove your listing, and then buy from the lowest priced source.  The downside is if perchance someone were to try and purchase your non-existant copy.  You'd have to cancel that order.  But since there is no transaction, the buyer can't give you negative feedback.  Of course Amazon doesn't like you canceling orders, so they'll cancel you account if you have a cancellation rate greater than 5%.

(The specs on e-bay say S-IPS, but it's certainly a lie.)<p>For those who don't differentiate between the different variants of IPS, e-IPS is a relatively new thing introduced around 2 years ago (by LG, I believe) and it's a simplified and much cheaper to manufacture version of IPS. Its characteristics are somewhere between TN and IPS.<p>Apart from the display itself, a monitor's quality is also very much dependent on its electronics. For this kind of money it's obvious they've put the absolute minimum into this thing.<p>(For a little comparison: I have an old, med-quality 19'' NEC 1990FX monitor and a cheap 23'' HP 2310ti touch monitor. The NEC weighs 9kg, the HP 8kg. How can a smaller monitor be heavier? It's all electronics.)<p>Same applies to other aspects: you can have no confidence in the monitor's electromagnetic emissions or reliability. And if the power supply fries for some reason in 3 months, don't count on your warranty.<p>I mean, you didn't believe for a second that a no-name brand that sells in the US purely thru e-bay will honor any kind of warranty, did you?",1343248488

However, this is largely seen as a security problem things like RFC 4941 [1] have argued against this idea.  If you think having your iPhone keep a track of which cell phone towers you've been to is bad, think about the consequences of being globally reachable by the same IP address at all times, which means you can be tracked to where that devices is and has been based on the routing rules.<p>As well, ethernet is not IP.  They are different layers of the OSI model.  Just because you're on ethernet (wired/wireless) doesn't mean you're using IP, and vice versa.  Some devices don't have MAC addresses.  Frame relay uses DLCI's for instance. Historically there were lots of other technologies using IP that weren't ethernet - FDDI, token ring, ATM, etc.  Ethernet has replaced nearly all of those, but not all.<p>Routing scalability - another huge problem. But this will rear it's head in IPv6 with the exponentially large amount of possible routes.  Right now the routing tables are around 350k-400k routes.  Compare that to the billions of devices that connect to the internet simultaneously.<p>MAC addresses are locally assigned addresses.  There would be no way to prevent duplicates.  In most networks, your IP address will specify the way you are routed through the network and your security level. If that isn't centrally managed you have no security or IP addressing schemes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4941</a>",1343246740

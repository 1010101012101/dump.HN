She has been as critical as many NGO interventions - ""The types of aid that I’m talking about, I’m not talking about humanitarian or emergency aid, sort of the aid that goes for tsunami, for example. Nor am I talking about NGO or charitable aid which is relatively small beer. I myself sit on the board of a number of charities. But I think it’s important where charities are concerned to understand what they can and cannot do. So they can provide Band-Aid solutions. So we can send a girl to school for example, but they cannot deliver long-term economic development growth and growth or alleviate poverty on the level that we want to see across the continent.""

They picked the wrong platform for the right reason (lot's of Java devs) and they hoped Sun would continue to be nice about it. Sun is gone now and all bets are off.<p>As developers, if we want our apps to have futures or to at least have some control over our own future, then we must use entirely free foundational tools (ISO standard programming languages with public domain/GPL/BSD/ licensed compilers and libraries) or be willing to face the consequences.<p>Nothing compares to the rug being jerked out from under you.

1605632,story,,,12,6,tripplez,"Ask HN: How to get started in web programming?",,"Hi all,<p>A little bit of introduction: I'm a programmer, with appr. 8 years of experience writing desktop application (CAD, in C++), and game programming in the last 3 years. The working experience regarding the programming languages is just bare C, some assembler, and C++ (in C-with-classes mode mainly).<p>Since I and my partner decided to go for a web startup (the application idea is still quite vague as expected), I've decided to do a research about how to get started in web programming as a beginner (in web programming) but as an experienced developer as a whole.\nHere is my current plan as a result from my research for learning of the necessary languages and technologies in order to make a prototype for out web application while still holding my day job:<p>Front-end development: my research concluded that for the beginning front-end development HTML, CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript are the classic bunch of technologies to learn. These are the books that I plan to read:<p>* ""Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML"" (O'Reilly) (Alternative: ""Web Design in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference"" (O'Reilly))<p>* ""Head First JavaScript"" (O'Reilly)<p>Back-end development: here I don't have a clue how to get started. I've familiarized with most of the current (I hope) widely used languages and frameworks, but just the names. I'm still searching for a book that clearly conveys the message that it is whole package for back-end development and at the same time showing the big picture. Maybe the multitude of technologies make the research and the choice quite hard, maybe just the inexperience, maybe both, but I'm struggling to decide with which programming language + framework combo to start, and which first book on the subject to buy and read. My personal preferences are towards Python since I've read 2 of most recommended introductory books and I've wrote some simple examples, so generally I've liked it, but this is quite biased and subjective...it's the only programming language from the common back-end choices to which I've been exposed.<p>Thanks in advance",1281897883

You are correct.<p>My philosophy recently has been that you do not want to create a new language.  Haskell makes it easy to make a custom DSL.  Unfortunately, that means a preponderance of new languages and mini-languages that you need to learn to get your work done.  More importantly, these mini-languages invariably are missing features that you are used to in your powerful language: imports, decorators, debuggers, etc. Django templates did not even have variable assignments for years.<p>My recent philosophy is Pythonic: don't make DSLs but make domain-specific libraries.  I have gone through many iterations to get this as minimal as possible while still being explicit and resisting putting in any magic.  The results are still surprisingly readable after a little practice.",1281896205

Also, there's a number of things on my wish list that compelled me to write my own lisp implementation (there are other JavaScript lisp implementations):<p>* only requirement is node.js and the lisp source distribution, no other dependencies.\n* ability to debug lisp code from the browser.\n* immutable data structures.<p>I feel I can implement a lisp that can run the examples in <i>Let Over Lambda</i> in a couple of weeks. The lisp won't be as stable as Parenscript but that's ok. Only at that point can the real work start of building the web framework that is lisp.js. I think the most important bit for me is to have a base that I can modify as the needs arise. I'm already trying to include as many lisp concepts in the test source as I can find to make sure lisp.js is a general purpose lisp. In that respect I'm setting several goals: get lisp-in-lisp working, get Let Over Lambda examples working, ... any other useful lisp constructs that I come across.

1605556,comment,1605119,1605271,0,0,Aegean,,,"I tried to build one from scratch based on my own L4 microkernel. Given the bloated nature of monolithic kernels and their irrelevance to embedded space, I had the thought that if I wrote something small and neat it could gain traction for embedded systems. For that I took the BSD virtual memory design, and implemented a complete VM system from scratch. Then I wrote a VFS layer but that one was partially complete. I had demand paging implemented and supporting calls like fork() execve() etc. It was challenging and fun - but an incomplete project, also my biggest error from a startup/making money point of view. Basically having a new kernel is a hard sell nowadays, no matter how neat it is. It was more of an intellectual challenge for me rather than a startup - but still I was in the expectation that it could be a success.<p>About exactly a year ago, I changed my direction to virtualization. I ditched about %60 of the software that includes all that VM layer and VFS for which I put loads of effort (many man months...). I realized I was out of focus, so I changed my focus to enhancing only the microkernel itself. I decided upon three specific goals: 1) Adding multi-core support for latest ARM cores (e.g. the ones that will be on most high-end mobile phones and devices) 2) Adding fine-grain security and control based on capabilities. (in short, having control over system calls) 3) Adding virtualization support for the linux kernel. Right now I am done with the first two, and about to get done with the 3rd one.<p>My interest has always been to create something new in the OS/kernel space. After doing much research I decided that L4 microkernel design represents the most promising work in this field. This is because a) monolithic kernels are mature and good for what they are doing b) microkernels can solve certain new problems like virtualization.<p>Eventually I was convinced that embedded virtualization would be the most interesting problem I could solve. In my opinion there is still room for systems-level work particularly in Virtualization. The APIs are not set in stone. Not many people know how virtualization works, let alone design an interface for it from scratch.<p>I think new areas like this will come up but its quite important to spot an unsolved problem because if you dive in to write a kernel its an expensive journey.",1281895299

They put all these passwords through their favorite one-way function, stuff the hashes in a newline-delimited text file, and hope it fits in a few gigabytes.

8727486,comment,8726056,8727315,0,0,mikeash,,,"Is there a real fundamental difference between the two approaches? It seems to me that it&#x27;s all about API, not underlying concepts. A filesystem may organize things hierarchically, such that the full path to a file is composed of the names of the various folders that contain it plus the name of the file itself, glued together with a path separator. Or a filesystem may organize things as a pure key-value store, where the file&#x27;s name is the full path. Code that uses the filesystem could then treat it either way. You can address files purely by full path on a hierarchical system, and you can pick a &quot;path separator&quot; and treat it like there were directories on a pure key-value store.<p>Applied to code, it&#x27;s really a matter of how you look up names. Prefixing is just the situation where there&#x27;s no language assistance in looking up names. Namespacing is just prefixes plus some automatic help in looking up partial names.",1418181133

Local traders are offering incentives, such as discounts if you pay in L£.<p>It doesn't force anyone to spend their money locally, because you can always trade your L£ for sterling.  It's more like a constant reminder and a helpful system for keeping money in the local economy.<p>Income in L£ is counted as sterling as far as the tax man is concerned.  Stewart Wallis of the NEF mentioned a local currency scheme in Australia where the taxes could be paid in local currency.  Of course when it came time to spend it it could only be spent locally. So they re-roofed the community centre.<p>There's a web site here: <a href=""http://www.thelewespound.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelewespound.org/</a>",1221036170

It is not a ""premature optimization"" for someone who really gets unix/linux.\nI have built <a href=""http://shellshadow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com</a> with C and have been very happy with the decision to get ""closer to the metal"" from the beginning.  My server processes are lean and mean.  They don't crash for inexplicable reasons.  When I have a bug, there are not many layers of technology to slug through.",1221034956

Once you get down to really dim (i.e. low photon count) flashes, you're in the realm of Poisson statistics.  So, on average, a flash of light might have 4 photons in it, but it could easily have 1 or 7.

This isn't for outlook, so it obviously isn't targeted to enterprise. Will the unwashed masses pay for a mail client when so many free options are available? If not... advertising on a desktop app?<p>It might be the best thing since sliced bread, but picking desktop mail clients as a place to innovate seems dangerous to me.",1221033620

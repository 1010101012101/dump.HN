The TURN server will produce the same server reflex candidate as your STUN server.<p>What port(s) were you using on your TURN server endpoint?

I think the DMCA should be updated with harsher penalties for improper takedown requests (&quot;copyfraud&quot;). Still, the policy Dropbox has seems pretty reasonable. And you can always choose to encrypt your files locally or even not use Dropbox. After all, it&#x27;s a company competing in a relatively free market.

See: eBay, Craigslist. Closer to AirBnB&#x27;s niche (since I see AirBnB as essentially &quot;Couchsurfing for money&quot;), Couchsurfing has also persisted despite taking the initial community organization private, which resulted in much of its initial active community leaving, and not really improving the site much since then... because it&#x27;s Couchsurfing, the site identified with a verb that refers to a particular kind of travel. (Large parts of the initial community founded BeWelcome, fwiw, which is a less-successful fork, though it has moderate traction.)<p>It&#x27;s possible to lose a big lead (see: MySpace), but a company that is popularly identified with a particular niche can coast for a really long time without doing much to deserve it.",1396216521

The insidious component to me in this whole equation is the one where people are led into a rather unquestioning belief that human potential -- be it in medical science and wherever -- would not exist or progress if it weren&#x27;t for a framework that allows temporary market dominion of capital (and the monopolies that arise from this). It&#x27;s nonsense. You&#x27;ve stated broad sweeping claims though. These claims very much do beg questions -- far more, to me, than any questions that result out of society having to cope in the absence of (punitive, violent) market constraints. My own presumption is in believing that, while answers that bridge a transition aren&#x27;t definitive, at least the path should strive toward an ethical horizon. Personally, to me, a republic that uses collective force to inhibit [people from researching, selling, and building upon concepts and therapies] -- a society with patents -- is a shining example of insidious, unethical, corrupt behavior. The SCOTUS had a tiny bit of sense to revoke some of the patents on genes, at least, if we&#x27;re to talk baby steps.",1396216424

I&#x27;ve found lots of <i>interfaces</i>, though.<p>A lot of the time, you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re defining a superclass when you start writing things like &quot;Square IS-A Shape; Rectangle IS-A Shape&quot;. But Shape will turn out to not define any common behavior, just a category you want to restrict your inputs and outputs to; and you&#x27;ll want to be able to assert that anything is, in addition to whatever else it is, a Shape. So shape is an interface.<p>A lot of the time, you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re defining a superclass when you start writing things like &quot;User IS-A Person; ProjectOwner IS-A User&quot;. But it&#x27;ll turn out that you want to keep People around even when they stop being Users, and to keep Users around even when they stop being ProjectOwners. So you&#x27;ll rearrange things and find that you&#x27;re now asserting &quot;User IS-A Role; ProjectOwner IS-A Role; Person HAS-MANY Roles.&quot; And Role turns out to be, again, an interface.<p>The only example I can think of that <i>does</i> fit single-inheritance is when modelling objects that directly express a genealogy. For example, GithubForkOfProjectA IS-A ProjectA, or Ubuntu IS-A Debian. But these aren&#x27;t typically things you&#x27;d express as <i>types</i>; they&#x27;re just <i>instances</i> (of, respectively, GithubProject and LinuxDistribution.) Each instance HAS-A clonal-parent-instance.<p>I guess there&#x27;s one <i>possibly</i>-practical use of inheritance which I&#x27;ve nearly implemented myself: if you force your database schema migrations to always follow the Open-Closed Principle, and you want to migrate the rows of a table as you encounter them to avoid taking the DB offline, then you <i>could</i> have two separate models for a Foo table, FooV2 and FooV3, where &quot;FooV3 IS-A FooV2&quot;. Each row has a version column, and is materialized as the model corresponding to that version. Your code that expected FooV2s would then be satisfied if it was passed a FooV3.<p>Does anyone actually do this, though? I don&#x27;t just mean &quot;row-by-row migrations&quot;, I mean the &quot;with two models, one version inheriting from the other&quot; part. And, if so, what do you do when you make a change to a model that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> obey the Open-Closed Principle: where FooV3s break the FooV2 contract?",1396215830

(Or, even worse, in many cases it boils down to &quot;could I reproduce this patented system totally by accident without ever even knowing someone else patented this simple system&quot;).<p>A good canonical example of this is Apple&#x27;s much maligned &quot;bounce scroll&quot; or slide-to-unlock patents (though Apple is hardly alone when it comes to this nonsense).<p>Any decent software developer could see either of those in action, having never read Apple&#x27;s patent and never seen Apple&#x27;s source code and whip up his or her own implementation in less than an hour.   That alone should invalidate these patents.<p>Some will argue that Apple&#x27;s original idea was unique at the time, so they should have a patent on those grounds, but that&#x27;s not what patents are supposed to protect (though massive amounts of money being funneled into lobbying and the legal system have served to obscure this in the past couple of decades).<p>Patents don&#x27;t exist to protect ideas, they are supposed to protect unique and novel implementations of inventions, not ideas.  There&#x27;s really not a true legal IP mechanism for the protection of ideas (even copyright is protection of expression, which is closer to ideas, but not quite the same).",1396214996

Not just to enable expensive investment, but to create an incentive structure that encourages scientific research that remains in the public domain. This is a critical point that people often miss in these arguments.<p>In computerland, we don&#x27;t come up with new computer science every time we program an application. In pharmaceutical land, you literally have to come up with new science to make a new drug.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that, as software developers, our perspective and opinions on patents are not fungible across all domains.<p>The patent system in the pharmaceutical industry <i>enables</i> a healthy drug research and design market with proper incentive structures. Abolishing patents in the pharmaceutical industry would retard research, skew incentives, and encourage trade secrets.<p>A patent free system would most likely result in a system of trade secrecy. Companies would not share their results, they would keep the secret formula to themselves. It would result in perpetual proprietary lockdowns.<p>After all, why make public the concept that you just spent billions of dollars and years of opportunity cost on? So that competitors can manufacture the drug at essentially zero cost? Nah, we&#x27;ll just keep that to ourselves, thank you very much.<p>Trade secrets are a threat to science.<p>You cannot build a foundation of science on a platform eaten away by trade secrecy. Trade secrecy will deprive humanity of the positive externalities of a significant chunk of pharmaceutical research.<p>As developers, we see patents as a threat. A sharp implement of the greedy. In the pharmaceutical world, patents are a necessary rung in the ladder of human advancement. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t always feel good to climb this ladder (consumer drug prices) but without it- there would just be a scrum of companies scrambling to climb up the research pole, each trampling each other&#x27;s investment returns (incentive) to zero. They&#x27;d get bruised and go find easier poles to climb up.<p>Yes, the patent system in the pharmaceutical industry has flaws. But it is <i>the best thing we have</i> given the alternatives.<p>If you are interested, please see see my other comment: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7497872"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7497872</a>",1396214186

Trying to develop secure and anonymous email",,"http://securmail.launchrock.com/<p>Hi guys, I have a problem and I need your help: me and a couple of my friends decided to create a web service for free anonymous and secure mail after hearing about the NSA debacle(Lavabit closing his doors). We created a launch page to get email for people to try out the service as beta tester. Just go check it out and if your are interested, signup.<p>If you have suggestions, don&#x27;t hesitate. We are working hard to build something great and useful for everyone. If you could share the service to help us out too, it would be awesome. Thanks<p>Really, it all comes down to how you want to protect your data. Now that we know Google&#x27;s been working with the NSA and other email services. There aren&#x27;t many options left for secure email.<p>Ever since news of PRISM broke, there&#x27;s been a lot of confusion and denial about exactly how the NSA is getting the data from the companies that have been collecting it. Now Google&#x27;s fessed up to the details, and it&#x27;s unsurprisingly simple: by FTP or even by hand.<p>With what we are building, it would be basically impossible to do. Built on AES-256 Encryption and Host Proof Hosting, ensuring that your sensitive data is never accessible to anyone but you. We never have your un-encrypted data. Even if our servers were hacked your emails would be safe and when you delete an email, it is not recoverable(US DOD, 7 passes). We do not log any traffic or session data. For this reason, we’re unable to identify any user of our service.<p>Here is the launch page: http://securmail.launchrock.com/",1396214179

Biotech firms have a very long lead time before getting FDA approval and can start making money.  Therefore, it shouldn&#x27;t be unusual that they are showing a loss each year.  You can&#x27;t create a MVP for a drug and starting selling it.<p>Second, the value of biotechs is firmly linked with IP.  If the drug works, no one else can sell it until the patent runs out (usually 8-10 years after FDA approval).  The valuations you see are not based on current revenue/profit, but rather potential revenue/profit once approval happens.  Tech companies don&#x27;t really have the benefit of IP that biotech companies have (someone can make an AirBnB knock-off and there is nothing AirBnB can do about it).<p>That said, I think the biotech stocks are getting really high valuations lately.  There is a TON of risk in biotech stocks.  If you&#x27;re drug has bad side effects, you might not get approval and future revenue = $0.

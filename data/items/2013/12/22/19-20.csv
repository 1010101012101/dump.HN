6951474,comment,6944118,6946342,2,0,smsm42,,,"Define &quot;threat to the world&quot;. Can Iran destroy the whole world? Fortunately, not. Can Iran destabilize, hurt and incite violence? Not only can, it is doing it right now.<p>>>>  basing threat levels on previous actions?<p>That would be stupid because it means that only the second action can be countered. Given how first action can cause devastating consequences, limiting oneself to only reacting to a second one would be terminally stupid. American administration, for example, was justly criticized for sleeping through 9/11, and acting unprepared when it happened. Generals like to prepare for the past wars, it is much easier, but there&#x27;s no reason to condone such behavior.<p>>>> who invades countries most often?<p>Invasions can differ. If Nazi Germany invaded Poland once, and Britain invaded Nazi Germany once, they are not equal.<p>>>> who&#x27;s military kills the most people?<p>Again, depends on the people. If Al-Qaida kills 3000 Americans in 9/11, and then Americans kill 10000 Al-Qaida fighters after that, I&#x27;d say good job, they only should have done it earlier, so we would have 3000 less victims.<p>>>> That saga ended with almost everyone looking bad.<p>It looks bad to you because you take an impossible position that fighting evil should be done without hurting anyone. It would be nice if there was a nice, fluffy, unicorn-land evil that you could fight by issuing a strongly-worded declaration  of condemnation and maybe refuse to send them a Christmas card next time. Unfortunately, real evil is much harder and messier to fight.",1387742380

A few big problems cropped up (dodgy insurance companies, regional government dealing with unsafe land, overwhelmed fire service etc), and things are far from sorted, however I am deeply impressed by what systems were in place. Funds existed to rebuild despite massive devastation, the emergency response was incredible and mostly well organized. There has been little corruption, mostly transparent processes and despite the most obnoxious bunch of cabinet ministers I can remember, the process has gone far better than I could have imagined.",1387742347

6951466,comment,6950492,6950772,1,0,clavalle,,,"So, I did some more detailed calculations on a $500,000 home with closing costs included.  I left out property taxes because I assumed anybody renting would recoup property taxes through increased rent.  So, assuming rent + taxes == mortgage + taxes on a $500,000 property with $100,000 down payment where the value of the property stays the same over the life of the mortgage:<p>$500,000  30yrs at 4.25%<p>20% down  $100,000<p>$1967.76  monthly payment<p>$22,644 closing costs<p>By year four you are in the black compared to renting by $6132  You&#x27;d need an investment on your $100,000 that returns 1.49% compounded annually to make up the difference if you rented and invested the $100K that would have been spent on the down payment.<p>By year five you are in the black by 14,122  You&#x27;d need 2.645%<p>By year six you are in the black by 22459 You&#x27;d need 3.382%<p>7 31157 3.881%<p>8 40233 4.234%<p>9 49701 4.5%<p>10 4.683%<p>30 5.222%<p>Here is the amortization chart:  <a href=\"http://www.myamortizationchart.com/30-year/400000-dollars/4_25-percent/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.myamortizationchart.com/30-year/400000-dollars/4_...</a><p>Here is the closing costs calculator I used:  <a href=\"http://michaelbluejay.com/house/closingcosts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://michaelbluejay.com/house/closingcosts.html</a><p>In short, you have a pretty good shot at breaking even between renting and buying if you invest the down payment.  If you have less than a 20% down payment (3% I think is what you need for a FHA loan) then you reach covering the closing costs faster with accumulated principal payments but your monthly payment can be significantly more (up to 20% more a month).<p>IOW a huge amount depends on what you can rent the same house for.  If rent == mortgage + tax these calculations hold.  If  rent is less than it is almost always going to be better to rent.  If rent is more you are looking at a better situation buying if you are staying more than a few years.  Also, interest rates would play a huge part.",1387742289

If it&#x27;s true that I share more DNA with these people than I do with a chimpanzee, it&#x27;s strictly a fluke of evolution.<p>(Edit: To be fair, some Googling suggests there are some more tangible environmental concerns with geothermal energy in Hawaii, but propitiating Pele appears to be a very real part of their argument as well.

I’ve had black girlfriends and might not implausibly have ended up married to one of them,<p>> my hindbrain thought it was surrounded by alien shit zombies. My forebrain, meanwhile, was all like “What is up with you, hindbrain?” Apparently my human-recognition template needed some updating.<p>> The pressure on me eased a bit when I realized that what I was experiencing was a really severe case of Uncanny Valley reaction, and that more exposure to minority X might well stretch my template to the point where they didn’t seem so creepily repulsive any more.<p>So basically, you took him out of context, and selected choice quotes from your citation in order to make ESR look as bad as possible.

6951412,comment,6949474,6950630,2,0,Piromancer,,,"I&#x27;m outside the SF startup bubble, and I interview a lot of mostly recent college grads. I like to ask theoretical questions, especially of college grads. It&#x27;s not because I expect that they&#x27;ll need hard CS skills, but it&#x27;s because I want to know the following things:<p>Can they effectively break down a hard problem into sub-problems?\nCan they compare the difficulty of sub-problems and prioritize?\nCan they, while working on one sub-problem, think about the effects that their solution will have on the other parts of the problem?\nCan they keep track of the big picture of what they&#x27;re trying to solve while working on a small part of it?\nCan they translate their ideas into code fluently?\nCan they adapt to change and fix their system cleanly?\nAre they interested in computing? Have they spent their own time on learning?<p>These are not theoretical results - these are the qualities that make or break an entry-level engineer. I ask formal CS questions because formal CS is a context that the candidates should be comfortable in, and thus I can ask a hard question quickly. However, I&#x27;m far more interested in the meta-questions than if they can get through the solution to Problem X.<p>I try to avoid measuring a candidate with a single question: if I&#x27;m doing a phone interview, I&#x27;ll try to hit many areas (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re familiar with Steve Yegge&#x27;s post on phone screens), so the formal CS part is rarely more than 20 minutes. On the other hand, for an on-site interview, we tend to each focus on specific areas, so I can happily spend an entire hour on one or two hard theoretical questions (if I get to cover the algorithms/data structures section).<p>So - your mileage may vary, and given that you have a significant track record, I don&#x27;t think that hard theoretical questions would be the best way to measure your ability. But for some categories of candidate (mostly recent college grads), I think that formal CS questions are a good meterstick.<p>(Edited for formatting)",1387741409

XML probably is the simplest recursive grammar around, which is the cause of the woes of people who try to treat it with Regex, and Java almost treat XML like an actual extension of itself, and most languages offer decent libraries to read, create and generally mangle XML trees.<p>So why isn&#x27;t XHTML created by building XML trees?<p>Why isn&#x27;t it mainstream to do stuff like this?

I use Simple, they do the former. One nice feature about Simple is you can disable the debit card directly from within the app, and then re-enable it if you need to (for example, if you lose your wallet temporarily).<p>Simple also sent me a new debit card automatically without prompting, their systems having noticed I&#x27;d shopped at Target last week.<p>The problem with the two factor system as you describe is that while it works for &#x27;cardholder not present&#x27; transactions (and there already exist standard two-factor methods for such payments, not that many banks use them), it would make retail POS payments incredibly slow. You&#x27;d have to wait for a text/push, you might not have any reception, then you&#x27;ve got to reply, etc. This is one reason why EMV is, for all its failings, more attractive than mag-stripe: it is considerably harder and more expensive to clone EMV cards.",1387739744

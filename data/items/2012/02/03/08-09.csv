I've never seen anything like this in a physical store.</i><p>But at a store you can simply look the item, and if it looks like it should fit try it on to see if it actually does fit.  The actual size printed on the item isn't that important in those cases.<p>The other aspect is that stuff like stitching, button holes, collar construction, and general feel and quality of the material used is incredibly hard to judge online, while trivial to judge in person.

I love the Arch community and I enjoy using the forum system more than Ubuntu's. Also, I hang out in the #archlinux channel and people are super friendly and helpful!<p>Ubuntu tends to be recommended for novices coming from Windows or Mac who are also unsure of the command line. My brother installed it after he purchased a cheap laptop. He came from Mac OS X and fell in love. After learning more, he installed Mint and really enjoys it. He is programming now! Obviously Ubuntu is for advanced users also. It just so happens that it is accessible to beginners as well which is great!<p>When switching distros, say from Debian to Arch, you should embrace the idea that fundamentals are completely different. Package management, for instance, must be re-learned. And the way daemons and modules are initialized and configured is different and plenty of other things! You are going to lose context and that can be the most frustrating part of switching. If you can overcome that and succeed at the new tools, you will have gained more skills.<p>The great thing about Linux is that it is free software. I love to experiment with Virtualbox and lots of distros for fun. I would encourage you to try a few, a couple non debian based, and see if you enjoy them more.",1328259262

Good for you for trying to look at the bigger patterns in your life and really be deliberate about approaching things the right way.<p>But I don't believe the answer is to disconnect the inner and outer world and be happy no matter what.  The whole point of living is to be a part of things.  The right approach is to improve or change your environment until you can live well inside it.<p>Since we're quoting books, I recently found a passage that says this well.  From The Timeless Way of Building by Alexander:<p>This state cannot be reached merely by inner work.<p>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need do only inner work, in order to be alive like this; that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself. This teaching has some value, since it is so easy for a man to imagine that his problems are caused by ""others"". But it is a one-sided and mistaken view which also maintains the arrogance of the belief that the individual is self-sufficient, and not dependent in any essential way on his surroundings.  The fact is, a person is so far formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings.",1328258980

The objc language has some interesting features like being able to signal a nil (the objc null). You can chain operations without having to care about fails in the middle, and check the final result for nil. This is the equivalent, saving the distance, to the java null pointer assignments, which is perhaps one of the most common errors.<p>The tricky issue about objetiveC and iphone is memory usage.  Memory that is not correctly managed, like free twice, it is going to fail crashing the app (the EXC_BAD_ACCESS error). Getting this right takes a considerable amount of time and effort. Tools to make this easier are the SDK memory monitor, static code analyzers like clang, or the automatic reference counting (ARC) which lets the compile handle <i>release</i> and <i>retain</i> operations for you.",1328258792

The author clearly is unfamiliar with the way we use the term ""hacker"" or even that it has another definition and, therefore, when Zuckerberg says that the term ""has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers,"" he doesn't realize Zuckerberg is trying to say that the term has an entirely different meaning from breaking into computers.  He clearly thinks Zuckerberg is saying that hackers (which he reads as ""people who break into computers"") are unfairly portrayed as people who break into computers to do bad, when in reality they sometimes break into computers for constructive reasons.  He doesn't realize Zuckerberg is literally saying that the media mistakenly interprets ""hackers"" as ""people who break into computers, period.""  Zuckerberg's use of ""connotation"" instead of ""denotation"" makes it sound like he's defending cracking philosophically as opposed to saying that hacking has a totally different meaning to people in the tech industry.<p>I've reprinted his quote of Zuckerberg with parenthetical glosses showing how the author and anyone not innoculated by knowledge of hacker culture would probably interpret it.<p>""In reality, hacking (breaking into computers) just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things, it (breaking into computers) can be used for good (to fight what you perceive as unjustice) or bad (personal gain or schadenfreude), but the vast majority of hackers I've met tend to be idealistic people (hippies who hate corporations) who want to have a positive impact on the world (by getting rid of capitalism).""<p>With that reading, I think most of us too would be disappointed or even furious with Zuckerberg.  I'm glad that wealth and fame haven't compromized Zuckerberg's view of himself as a hacker in our sense of the word, but I think he did a really bad job explaining to the media that the word is used completely differently by techies.  That is unfortunate since he is one of the few people with enough influence to get the public to understand and adopt our usage of the word.",1328258055

It's pretty simply and I have personally broke into my own File Vault partitions after forgetting the password. You don't even need to spent $995, it's trivial to do with almost no skills. Anyone can do it themselves, which should convince them that File Vault is useless and its CPU load a pointless price to pay for zero security gain. This has all been dead obvious from day one too, the cited article is not even news, it's an advertisement for a company selling junk to clueless law enforcement incapable of doing basic research.<p>edit: OK, I'm wrong on some technical details:<p>1. Apple uses SHA-1 hashing not MD5.<p>2. I either need admin access in any account to access the /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/ folder and pull the plist with the hash from the account I am interested in, or I need to boot in Firewire mode which allows raw disk access to the unencrypted partition with that folder. (I haven't paid $995 for the referenced program but that would seem possible that's what it is really doing, not reading memory through FireWire looking for the plaintext password stored in the open in memory, which is also possible: <a href=""http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-firewire-dma-part-1-overview-and-mitigation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/physical-memory-attacks-via-f...</a> - this also helpfully notes that ""sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOFireWireFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleFWOHCI.kext"" deletes the relevant kernel extension to kill FW - I happen to already have this removed for other reasons.)<p>Still just as vulnerable to rainbow tables, but shoot maybe it does scan memory.",1328257518

3546329,comment,3545008,3545716,2,0,exDM69,,,"The reason I'm <i>not</i> using Clojure is that it's based on the Java platform. I keep hearing that JVM is nice because there are good libraries, but I haven't figured out what the good libraries are. Sure, there are some nice platform independent abstractions for common operating system interfaces like file and network I/O, but it still lacks lots of stuff.<p>The problem with Java libraries w.r.t. modern high level languages is that Java libraries are built on Java abstractions. It doesn't matter how high level the new language is, but when interfacing with Java libs, you have to stick to single dispatch object oriented programming. So in the end, there are many cases where you use the Java library through some wrapper layer written in Clojure or your Clojure code ends up looking a lot like Java.<p>Once you add a wrapper layer shim between your preferred language and the platform, it doesn't matter what's underneath. That's why I like to stick to languages that are built on native code and libraries, C and Posix and Unix API's with some Linux and/or BSD additions. Of course, if you want to run on Windows, all the code has to be duplicated since Win API's are different.",1328257148

If you have many small objects, the reference count itself may become a significant memory overhead.  Furthermore, GC means that memory allocation can be done by allocating at the top of the heap instead of a more expensive malloc, and freeing garbage may be literally free depending on the algorithm used.  When an object falls out of scope in a reference counted world, it is typically immediately freed - if this is a handle into a large recursive data structure, for example, it can definitely suck up cycles.  Counterintuitive as it may seem, GC can be the cheapest solution in some circumstances, unless your program eschews malloc entirely.",1328256663

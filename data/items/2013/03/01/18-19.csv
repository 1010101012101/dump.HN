Watsi is proving that truly transparent peer-to-peer giving is better than traditional ""Donate Now"" forms of giving, and we're ecstatic that our partners are adopting the model. In fact, down the line, we'd like to white label our platform so that partners can feature patients on their sites as easily as they can feature them on Watsi (CURE being the one exception, since they've done a great job of p2p giving or a while now).",1362164382

5306178,comment,5304873,5305880,5,0,andolanra,,,"Haskell and languages in the ML family have a lot of opportunities for elaborate static analysis, which often allows the resulting programs to be quite clever about optimizing the resulting programs. As one example, the GHC Haskell compiler uses loop fusion to combine multiple passes over a list into a single pass with no intermediate copies of the list produced. Consequently, Haskell code like<p><pre><code>    map f (map g (map h someList))\n</code></pre>\nis going to involve allocating exactly one list of the same size as someList, while a direct translation into Python<p><pre><code>    map(f, map(g, map(h, someList)))\n</code></pre>\nis going to involve the creation of several intermediate lists.",1362164281

If Facebook bans certain expression of thought or certain types of media/pictures, then that decision has pretty widespread effects. Even worse, when exposed to this kind of thinking, other countries will slowly start to adopt it.<p>On the other hand, other countries would enforce a different kind of morals more (like censorship related to racism and religion).<p>I love it when some sites make exceptions, like Tumblr (or Reddit in the past).",1362163774

Same with some Lisp variants as well--there was even a research whole-program optimizing compiler for Scheme that apparently sometimes beat hand-optimized C (Stalin Scheme).<p>So one way to improve performance is simply by having a good compiler. And GHC, at least, is a <i>very</i> good compiler.<p>Also, Haskell support for direct memory control is not that bad. In fact, in some ways, it's better than even Java--you can have your own unboxed data types which essentially act like structs, for example. This also means that you can have unboxed arrays of more than just primitive types.<p>Haskell also does some very clever things with both the heap and the stack, but I'm not familiar enough with its internals to comment. My understanding is that Haskell makes heap allocation much cheaper and has a GC optimized for handling lots of small allocations (as you would expect for a functional language).<p>Ultimately, the point is that the question is fairly nuanced and you won't be able to pin down a single language or implementation feature that uniquely determines performance.",1362163754

If you consider strings as just lists of characters, then it's basically a deforestation problem: the goal is to eliminate all the intermediate lists of lists that are constructed. (It's something of a peculiar case though, because in order to transform into the C code you need to not only observe that indexing an rvalue via [1] and throwing the rest away means that the list doesn't have to be constructed at all, but you also need to allow strings to share underlying buffer spacethe latter optimization isn't deforestation per se.)<p>I don't know if there's been much effort into deforestation optimizations for dynamic languages, but perhaps this is an area that compilers and research should be focusing on more.<p>On another minor note, I do think that the deck is a little too quick to dismiss garbage collection as an irrelevant problem.

The CFAA is overly broad and can be used to prosecute almost anyone -- but it was not until Aaron's death that anyone cared.

The move of sensitive information from the desktop to the browser is leading to a ""sandbox"" everything approach, which may not be safer, but should at least mitigate the damage done. Nowadays if you compromise the machine of an individual, you own everything they use and everything they do. With some sort of sandboxing between tabs and between privileged user resources (contacts, messages, email, calendaring), the amount of resources an attacker can control is reduced. The problem on the desktop is that the default M.O. has always been to trust the user entirely with respect to everything, but machine administrative (root) actions. With sandboxing and new security models around the user's own data, the M.O. now becomes only trust the user within one area of their life, but not between areas of their life (so a PDF document can't affect their email without explicit user action)<p>Sandbox all the things.",1362162842

Look at Objective C (mentally wipe off all the object goo), particular NSMutableString and NSMutableArray and NSMutableData, for examples of what I'm thinking about.<p>The C syntax we're stuck with. But how big a deal is that syntax?<p>Segfaults are mitigated if you don't expose pointers, except to the extent that C programmers have to think about memory lifecycle (like I said, I think this is indisputably a win for high level languages). Look at NSMutableString for an example of a C-style idiom that removes whole classes of pointer operations.<p>I dispute that JITs abstract away details about storage; they may allow you to not think about those details for code that doesn't need to be performant, and they can help the language get out of the way when you need to care about the storage details, but the question I'm asking is limited to performant code. There is no question that nonperformant Python code is way easier to write than any kind of C code!<p>There are better APIs available in Python than are commonly available to C or even ObjC, but that's a solvable problem. Let's stipulate better APIs, to the limit of what the language would allow (in other words, it's totally fair to say that the design of C/C++ would prohibit certain kinds of easy APIs).<p>Development and deployment are easier in some cases for Python (for instance, building on OS X and deploying on Linux), but far easier for C in others (for instance, building code that will run in a kernel or as a plugin in the address space of another process).<p>I dispute that the barrier to optimization is lower in Python for obvious reasons: C programmers can optimize without working around the exposed wires and ductwork of the language runtime. C programmers generally have an easier time optimizing than Python programmers; that is probably the #1 reason any Python programmer ever writes C.<p>As a current Golang programmer I agree strongly with the commenter below that when you take this idea and apply it to a new language you wind up with something that looks a lot like Go, which does work great.

Bitcoin is only a few years old.  It is not nearly well-studied enough to claim that there is any good evidence that double spending is costly.  Keep in mind that in the first few years of RSA, people thought that 128 bit public keys would be sufficient for centuries.  Bitcoin has not received anything close to the attention RSA received from the research community, or even that attention given newer ciphers like AES.<p>""Also it doesn't really matter if there is some obscure method to cheaply double spend""<p>That is kind of like saying, ""It does not really matter if there is some obscure method to crack RSA quickly.""<p>""since because of its obscurity it would only affect a small number of transactions (and presumably once it is used it will be detected and made public, at which point it can be fixed).""<p>Or it might turn out that there is no fix and that the attack would work no matter what you did to Bitcoin.  Maybe not confirming transactions is an inherently insecure way to do business.  It is equally possible that cheap double spending attacks are impossible due to some property of Bitcoin.  Right now there is no clear answer; you just have to shrug and hope for the best if you neglect to wait for confirmations.",1362162360

This is not a good thing.<p>For example, moving around by using the search feature (at least a well-designed incremental search like Vim or Emacs) <i>is</i> more efficient for longer distance moves (e.g. more than a couple of lines)--it's faster and, more importantly, takes less thought and context switching.<p>When you have to move to a distinct part of your text file, chances are you know what the content there is. With a command like /, you directly turn that knowledge into efficient movement. With the arrow keys, you have to leave the home row and do a bunch of movements to get where you're going. You have to figure out how to turn the word you want to go to into a bunch of arrow actions. It's even more difficult of your target is off-screen.<p>Ultimately, a rich set of movement commands you can access without moving your hand is going to be more efficient than using the standard arrow keys. This is particularly true for somewhat semantic commands like moving by block or expression or moving to a word (the command in question here).<p>Ideally, you want to move around faster with less context switching. Keyboard-oriented editors like Vim and Emacs are much better at this than any other editor I've seen, as long as you learned how to use them properly. This really makes the learning curve more than with it.",1362161747

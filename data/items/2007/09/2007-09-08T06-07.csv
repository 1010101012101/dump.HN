52105,comment,51979,51979,0,0,elad,,,"Can you persuade potential investors that you have a concrete advantage over competitors? Something that they can't (or won't) copy easily?
As for the size of the market, IMHO there's no such thing as ""large enough for all of the competitors to co-exist"" on the internet. That works maybe when you can carve yourself a geographic niche (e.g. grocery stores, banks, and there's consolidation going on lately in both markets). When online markets mature, only a handful of competitors survive (e.g. search).
You may want to try and redefine your market - as a subset of the large market you see now. Try to show how there are customers whose needs were overlooked by all other competitors, but you're going to serve their needs and thus come to dominate this niche.",1189233507

Just turn the site on and see what happens. Shared hosting can also get you surprisingly far, MediaTemple offers 1 TB of transfer for $17/month. They kind of suck other than the massive amount of bandwidth offered. And it'll be much more expensive if you need a VPS for lower level functions.<p>Before you write the business plan, I'd fill out a Y Combinator application, whether you plan on applying or not. It asks really good questions, some of which you may have not already asked yourself. From there, if you want to write a business plan, go for it. <p>A business plan take whatever format you want to. There are certain things that will always need to be there, but the order varies a whole lot. You can find a bunch of different templates if you just google for business plan template, pick one you like. Don't write the whole thing at once, start with a two page executive summary and then slowly expand it.<p>Also, I have some decent business plan resources, including PaloAlto's business plan software and some .pdfs. Email me and I'd be happy to share.",1189233163

""Kolsky"" means ""of Kola"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula</a>), and there are several ways of transliterating it into English. ""Research Institute"", too, could be one of several things, and each could have a different English translation. It would take a while to try all possible combinations in Google and see if something comes up, but that nothing comes up for ""Kolsky Research Institute"" means nothing.",1189232006

He certainly looks like he'll make it to 81, but you can't expect a whole lot more, even with ten cups of green tea a day, so it seems like a personal goal to him.  You can do it, Ray!<p>By the way, the first paragraph of that bio should be credited as being identical to the one on Ray Kurzweil's own site, which is considerably less plain than Jaron Lanier's (not that it means anything, in my opinion...):<p><a href=""http://www.kurzweiltech.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kurzweiltech.com/</a>",1189231732

He has founded nine businesses in the fields of OCR, music synthesis, speech recognition, reading technology, virtual reality, financial investment, medical simulation, and cybernetic art.<p>The inventor attributes his success in marketing technology products to being able to predict the arrival date of competitively priced components and match it to rollout of his designs, for example, the hand-held book reader built into a digital camera.[1]<p>Kurzweil was inducted in 2002 into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. He received the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize, the United States' largest award in invention and innovation, and the 1999 National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest honor in technology.<p>He has also received scores of other awards, including the 1994 Dickson Prize (Carnegie Mellon University's top science prize), Engineer of the Year from Design News, Inventor of the Year from MIT in 1998, the Association of American Publishers' award for the Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990, and the Grace Murray Hopper Award from the Association for Computing Machinery and he received the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in 2000. He has received thirteen honorary doctorates, a 14th scheduled in 2007, and honors from three U.S. presidents. He has been described as ""the restless genius"" by the Wall Street Journal, and ""the ultimate thinking machine"" by Forbes. Inc. magazine ranked him #8 among entrepreneurs in the United States, calling him the ""rightful heir to Thomas Edison,"" and PBS included Ray as one of sixteen ""revolutionaries who made America"", along with other inventors of the past two centuries.[3]""

Then by some funny coincidence, OSX gets based on UNIX so now any government hacker anywhere can hack into your Mac with the greatest of ease.  Why would you want to rock that boat if you were the government?  You wouldn't.

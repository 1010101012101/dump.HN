So assuming they do 8 hours of interview every day, that is 3x8x3 = 72 teams. This is not including those teams which are local and have been moved to the weekdays. So all in all, those who are selected, don't be too happy yet, there's still only about 1/7 chance of getting into the final 10. ",1176281603

11782,comment,11777,11777,0,0,felipe,,,"We've been using plain paper & pen to create mock-ups, but it's kind of hard to collaborate online (many interactions of scan-email-comment).<p>So far I liked this one: <a href=""http://www.mockupscreens.com"">http://www.mockupscreens.com</a> . There's another one called Axure, but it's quite expensive: <a href=""http://www.axure.com"">http://www.axure.com</a> . I tried Denim a while back (<a href=""http://dub.washington.edu/denim/"">http://dub.washington.edu/denim/</a> ), but it's a pain to use with a mouse (Denim was designed for tablet-pcs). Drawing tools are ok, but they do not have ready-to-use UI components like buttons, drop-downs, etc... Visio has UI components, but it's expensive.<p>Are you using any tools for web app mock-ups?",1176281115

11780,comment,11780,9770,0,0,test,,,"As a younger (20's) half reader who also happens to be a pro photographer, I think the hyperbole of ""all apps on the web!"" is silly. Tell me, when will my upload speed equal the speed of my 10,000 RPM Raptor HD's? My Core 2 Duo? Man, I can't sit around and wait while 75MB RAW files are uploaded to someone else's computer (that's all a server is, after all).  This is the day and age of the personal super computer.  Outsourcing apps to the web and cheering their stripped down interfaces isn't progress to me.  It's like watching your neighbor's HD TV through the window with binoculars.

I met you and Robby a month ago when I visited YC the day after demo night -- you guys had just settled on the name ""Zenter.""  I'll admit my skepticism regarding the usefulness of current web-based productivity apps, yet all it took to convince me was your demo, especially the Google Images and ""webcasting"" features.<p>Very excited to see what the future holds for you guys!",1176280919

11773,comment,11285,11650,0,0,casta,,,"Thanks for the advice!<p>The only thing that makes us feel bad is the impression that we developed it without interest. We built novlet in our spare time while graduating, so we couldn't spend the time we would have liked to, however we were very interested in the project and it's a pity that it doesn't seem so.<p>The site was initially meant mainly as a proof that we could work togheter, but it would be great to work on it full time, but apparently they didn't even look at it.<p>We are not discouraged, it would have been a fantastic experience.
We'll keep on working.",1176280145

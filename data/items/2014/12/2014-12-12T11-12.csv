When I talk about Watson here I mean the Question Answering (QA) system.<p>At a very high level DeepDive consists of a Knowledge Graph construction tool, and a probabilistic querying tool. Compared to Watson it is missing a natural language question parsing tool, and any way of dealing with questions that aren&#x27;t in the KG.<p>Watson has (very strong) natural language understanding for multi-claused questions, and the Jeopardy version can do things like understand puns. Deepdive doesn&#x27;t have anything comparable. In the open source space, the closest thing I&#x27;m aware of is SEMPRE[1][2].<p>Watson also has a evidence scoring module, and my understanding is that this can work against unstructured data. Deepdive doesn&#x27;t have this, and instead relies on probabilistic inference. This is an excellent approach, but relies on doing content extraction first (ie, extract entities and relationships from text and/or other sources).

My biggest problem with Graphite was that it managed to grind an expensive large RAID array into the ground with a relatively small number (in my eyes) of metrics. We had the realisation that we&#x27;d waste a tremendous amount of hardware or have to cut down drastically on our data collection if we were to roll out Graphite across the board.<p>(And yes, we had crashes too)<p>The reason for the disk grinding was simple: The whisper storage system is <i>ridiculously</i> inefficient as it does tiny writes all over the places, and an excessive number of system calls to boot.<p>In our case, I decided we don&#x27;t care if we lose some data if a metric server crashes - if it becomes an issue we&#x27;ll run two or more vms on separate hardware and feed half our samples into each -, so the first step was to write a simple statsd replacement that shovels 10 second intervals of data into Redis with disk snapshots turned off, coupled with a small daemon that rolls up (I&#x27;ve hardcoded roll-up intervals as it made it easy to use naming of the keys to use &quot;keys <timestamp for start of each interval to roll up>-<postfix for type of period e.g. we use 10 second then 5 minutes, then hourly>-*&quot; to retrieve the keys of the objects to process each step).<p>We could&#x27;ve easily beat Carbon/Graphite on the same system just by doing more efficient disk writes, but since we were first going to replace it I figured I might as well keep things in memory.<p>Then a tiny replacement for the subset of the Graphite HTTP API we used for our graphing (if we&#x27;d relied on Graphite itself for our dashboards I&#x27;d have thought twice about this...).<p>Lastly a tiny process that archives a final roll-up of data past 48 hours (currently) to CouchDB for if/when we need to do longer term historical trending.<p>I keep wanting to talk to our commercial director about letting me release some of this code, though a lot of it is probably too specific to our needs to be all that useful to others (e.g. as mentioned, we only support a tiny subset of the functionality of the Graphite HTTP API, as I&#x27;ve only cared about being able to do the averaging and filtering etc. that we actually use).

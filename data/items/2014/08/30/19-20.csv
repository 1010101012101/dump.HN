8247400,comment,8246760,8246760,4,0,mikeleeorg,,,"Many friends of mine are doctors and they&#x27;ve expressed the same feelings. There are days when they absolutely love what they do, but as an outsider, I see them experiencing more low days than high days.<p>Just as an anecdote, part of it is the expectations of the patient population in the Bay Area - and I&#x27;m only referring to the high income neighborhoods here; the situation differs significantly in low income neighborhoods.<p>Patients from high income backgrounds tend to be much more demanding than patients from low income backgrounds. At Stanford, the doctors in the emergency department are (informally) expected to stop what they&#x27;re doing and sing Happy Birthday to certain high income individuals.<p>A lot of doctors translate this to a lack of respect, which echoes the quoted statement in the article.<p>Here&#x27;s another anecdote. While sites like WebMD are fantastic for educating the general public about health issues, it also makes some people falsely believe they know more than the doctors treating them. And I don&#x27;t mean they simply question their doctors - that is a good practice and everyone should be as educated as they can about their own health. But apparently many people argue and flat out ignore their doctors, even when their own knowledge is tragically incorrect. As one doctor put it, &quot;Why did they come and see me at all, if they are already convinced of what they have? Just to waste their own time and money, not to mention my time?&quot;<p>Again, there are times when one should definitely question their doctor and be as educated as they can. Second, third, and additional opinions can be very useful. But I&#x27;m sure many doctors would appreciate less arrogance and animosity in their attitudes.<p>One more note. Apparently a very high number (between 75-99%) of all doctors will have faced a malpractice claim at least once in their career. Most of these claims are frivolous, but going through something like this is extremely demoralizing. A couple of doctors I know came close to leaving the profession because of it, even after they were cleared of all wrongdoing.<p>I once described the job of a project manager to a doctor friend as a &quot;thankless profession,&quot; and he immediately said, &quot;that sounds like my job too!&quot;",1409428586

8247397,comment,8246760,8247332,2,0,jrapdx3,,,"Of course, talking about the US health care &quot;system&quot; is hazardous given the enormous diversity of systems within it.<p>No doubt there are instances whereby particular &quot;industrial&quot; implementations function well.  But there are also many that function poorly.  &quot;Industrialization&quot; is a term that can be applied to mean numerous and distinctly different things.<p>I was referring to situations I&#x27;ve observed where doctors are restricted from taking time when necessary to evaluate complex cases.  Facing a patient with several serious conditions interacting and combining is far different than dealing with a patient having one condition.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to do the job well when &quot;bean-counters&quot; insist on scheduling tightly and emphasis is on &quot;production&quot;.  This is particularly problematic in primary care settings.<p>Having been involved in quality assurance activities for many years, I fully understand the value of consistency, adherence to rational protocols, etc.  But the ability to deal with &quot;outliers&quot;, especially when the exception is the rule, is where &quot;industrialization&quot; is at risk of failing.",1409428531

8247393,comment,8246760,8247174,8,0,alexqgb,,,"It&#x27;s not true to say that the US, in general, ignores these systems when in fact, a significant portion of the US population pays very close attention to them and would like nothing more than to seem them implemented here.<p>There is, however, a significant minority of really horrible, angry, violent, and generally racist people who feel deeply and ideologically threatened by the social contract on which these systems rest. And because of some unfortunate quirks in the American electoral system, they wield a level of political power that vastly exceeds their numbers. In a properly representational system, they&#x27;d be just as aggressive, ignorant, and self-defeating as they are right now. However, the body politic would be largely insulated from their rage, allowing us to safely get on with the design and development of a decent, cost-effective system.<p>In other words, we&#x27;re being plagued by a really nasty infestation of trolls, and it&#x27;s making progress in general pretty damn difficult. The good news is that this, too, shall pass. In demographic terms, this problematic political outlook is the rooted in the reactionary portion of the generation that came of age during the Civil Rights era. Their bigotry translated into a life-long political identity that has done everything it can to resist, if not reverse the &quot;loss&quot; they suffered in the wake of Jim Crow ending.<p>The Drug War is probably the best example of their continued effort to put a boot on the necks of black people. It&#x27;s worth noting that the militarization of US police forces, combined with an exploding private prison industry, took root in the former Confederate states before spreading outwards to damage the rest of the nation. And of course, opposition to any kind of drug legalization remains strongest in places with the deepest histories of institutionalized racism.<p>The same perspective that says the state should be used as a weapon to harm black people also says the state should <i>not</i> be used to protect or help them in any way. Thus, the vitriolic opposition to any kind of welfare program than benefits black people. Keeping them out of the health care system was part and parcel of this larger push for institutionalized white supremacy.<p>But again, all this is a generational reaction to the 1960s, a particularly divisive and transformative time in American politics. When the generation that dedicated itself to obstructing the movement for greater equality finally passes from the stage, there won&#x27;t be another one with either the size or the depth of hatred to maintain the current levels of opposition. So even in an electoral system as warped as ours, the certifiably batshit-insane won&#x27;t be able to maintain their dominance. That&#x27;s bad news for everyone with a stake in Fox News, great news for everyone else on planet Earth.<p>At that stage, with the right wing of the baby boom dead and buried, America will be able get on with the long-delayed work of creating a more-perfect union. Given how much pent-up demand there is for policies that reflect intelligence, fairness, humanity, and decency, I suspect demand for change - and the consensus to support it - will appear quite swiftly. So it&#x27;s nice to know that there are already well-developed models we can refer to when the time comes.",1409428455

See also the GE Flight Quest: <a href=""https://www.gequest.com/c/flight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gequest.com/c/flight</a> Those winners used industry-standard machine learning, optimization techniques, but also creative insights and hunches, like tweaking the target labels:<p>&quot;A next step is to ask, “What should I actually be predicting?”. This is an important step that is often missed by many – they just throw the raw dependent variable into their favorite algorithm and hope for the best. But sometimes you want to create a derived dependent variable. I’ll use the GE Flight Quest as an example: you don&#x27;t want to predict the actual time the airplane will land; you want to predict the length of the flight; and maybe the best way to do that is to use the ratio of how long the flight actually was to how long it was originally estimated to be and then multiply that times the original estimate.&quot; - Steve Donoho - <a href=""http://blog.kaggle.com/2014/08/01/learning-from-the-best/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kaggle.com/2014/08/01/learning-from-the-best/</a><p>Furthermore, it is entirely clear to everyone that data science in a business setting and in a competitive sport setting is different. To say they are equal, would be to say something like: paintball is equal to being in the military. But to say that Kaggle is not machine learning is to say: paintball requires no marksmanship.<p>There are some very messy, unwieldy datasets on Kaggle right now. For example the Seizure Detection challenge has many GBs of raw sensor data, from just a few patients. This would require a competitor to clean, understand problem domain, understand evaluation metrics, measure cross validation and put your model in production on your laptop in the evening hours.<p>The author of that blogpost is invited to team up, with me or others.

No one in medicine is a &quot;miracle worker&quot;, though many of us work hard to the job responsibly.<p>You are wrong.  We do &quot;save lives&quot;, and not just in the ED.  Every day, if not as dramatically, immediately or even noticeably, our incremental toil helps patients progress bit-by-bit toward better health.  Managing chronic, debilitating conditions really does enable patients to live longer and more fully.<p>You are also wrong regarding income.  Doctors in the US are getting paid less and less, while expenses of practice go ever higher.  My own income is probably less than most of the people I know in other professions.<p>The &quot;mess&quot; of the health care system (to the extent it is even systematic) is the result of the constant assault of corporations and governments at all cost to &quot;reduce costs&quot;, but the result has been the degradation you and others notice.<p>The most conspicuous evil has been perpetrated by the insurance industry.  For example, amazingly short-sighted insistence on paying for a &quot;generic&quot; medication $3/mo cheaper than the drug already working is an every day challenge.  If patients don&#x27;t get what is really needed, they wind up getting sicker, need more care, the result is more money spent, not saved.<p>The problem is that the industrialization of medicine makes it increasingly difficult to be helpful.  People are not neat little uniform units produced in factories.  People are enormously complex organisms that defy all rules we invent to &quot;explain&quot; illness and treatment.  People are unique entities that require individual attention and customized approaches if true &quot;health care&quot; is going to be provided.<p>If doctors are given the resources, time and respect to do their work, I believe almost all will strive to do it right.",1409425634

Most investors think that the minimum amount needed for a potentially (still very low chance) successful Semi startup is $100 million, which is nonsense carried over from the last century. I recently talked with a name partner at a very large (universally known) VC in the valley, and they thought that for a 5-10% chance at success, a fabless semi startup needed $100 million minimum, and to increase that to 30% you needed $250 million and hundreds of engineers. The only reason these ideas are prevalent throughout the venture world is because the market incumbents (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, etc) want the rest of the world to think that they are the only viable companies so that new competitors do not form. Over the past 10 years the semiconductor IP (and standard cell) ecosystem has made huge progress, saving significant time and money on the design and implementation of parts of a chip that are not the startup&#x27;s &quot;secret sauce&quot;... FPGAs and their tools have only gotten better, allowing anyone to test a new chip/component design with little more than a laptop and a relatively inexpensive FPGA. The fact that the foundries of the world have been able to lower the cost of multiproject wafer fabrication runs, making test of 50-100 chips of real silicon cost as little as $500,000 using a ~4 year old process to $2,500,000 for the latest (20nm) process. The fact that these fabs want to be producing at capacity means that the cost for getting to a full fabrication run (tens to hundreds of thousands of chips) can cost as little as $5,000,000 and goes up to about $15,000,000 depending on the fab and the process.<p>Realistically, a small startup of ~3 people should be able to prove something on an FPGA (and show good simulations for a produced chip) for ~$100,000-$250,000. ~5-10 people and $2 to $5 million should be able to produce actual chips, and depending on the process node, be able to produce a couple thousand chips and have revenue. No modern fabless semi startup that should exist that has the right team should need more than $15 million to be able to get to revenue and hopefully profitability. I&#x27;ve always believed and thought that it was a silicon valley idea that innovation happens with small teams with what are thought of as crazy ideas... and if they aren&#x27;t able to do it with 1/10th of the capital and 1/10th of the number of people, and the potential to make something 10x better, then it is not a worthy startup.",1409425404

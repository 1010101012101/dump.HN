I'd just like to find something useful to do with it (for beginning, I just wanted to practice soldering and did not even care much about the resulting gadget).",1245430774

665479,comment,664954,665166,0,0,mseebach,,,"> Joel talks about this on the Stackoverflow podcast when they discuss using a lawyer to review the FogCreek office rental agreement.<p>This is not a rental contract, that the ability of 100 (?) employees to their job rests on. If Joel gets to the Fog Creek office one morning and finds the locks changed, he looses thousands of dollars a day - and not just his own money, that's money that he already owes in wages and so on. Absolutely, get a lawyer.<p>These two guys are doing some contracting on the side. There are no investments and no liabilities. Their worst case scenario is walking away, not talking to each other, maybe disputing a few $1000. Doing ten rounds with a lawyer (there's really no boiler contract that can cover every conflict two friends working together might encounter) easily costs that, AND then you'll still have to go to court to enforce the contract.<p>Spend an afternoon writing down a page of bullet points of the rules that should govern this cooperation.<p>> You should have a lawyer look at most contracts you sign.<p>No, you should familiarize yourself with basic contract law and be able to estimate the worst case scenario, and decide if that's a risk you want to take.",1245430765

But the problem would then be that people can then use any of a number of proxies, etc, to get around that - Mibbit certainly does not have any incentive to block proxies, it's interested only in ad views. So it seems there would be a conflict of interest between Mibbit, interested in maximising users, and freenode, interested in maximising quality. Anyway, obviously freenode couldn't easily get around it, otherwise this news item wouldn't exist, right?<p>Funnily enough, I'm currently writing my own (toy) IRC server too, though I doubt it will (or could) ever serve the numbers you're talking about!

We compared \nArdilla’s ability to ﬁnd ﬁrst-order XSS attacks to that of \na black-box fuzzer for ﬁnding XSS attacks: Burp Intruder\n(listed in the 10 most popular Web-vulnerability scanners). \nWe conﬁgured the fuzzer according to its documentation. \nThe fuzzer requires manual setting up of HTTP request pat- \nterns to send to the Web application (and requires manual \nindication of variables to mutate). We ran the fuzzer using \nthe same attack pattern library that Ardilla uses, and on the same subject programs. (We have not been able to success- fully conﬁgure webchess to run with the fuzzer.) We ran the fuzzer until completion (up to 8 hours). The fuzzer found 1 ﬁrst-order XSS vulnerability in schoolmate, 3 ﬁrst-order in faqforge, 0 in EVE, and 0 in geccbblite. We examined all vulnerabilities reported by the fuzzer and determined that they were a subset of those discovered by Ardilla.</i><p>Ardilla looks like awesome work, but this is a specious metric. Burp Intruder isn't a fire-and-forget platform for finding XSS and SQLI; it's a tool to accelerate manual testing.

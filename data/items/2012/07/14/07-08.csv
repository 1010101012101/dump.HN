There's a handful of commands which let you do a lot of stuff.<p>The hard part in SQL is optimization which requires really understanding how the underlying database engine optimizes and executes the query.<p>Optimizing complex queries is no joke. It's one of the reasons noSQL seems nice at glance. You can do the optimizations by adding lots of indexes or using application logic. In reality, it's a tradeoff for other problems.",1342252738

Sure they were contrived, but they support the idea that theoretically any JIT runtime should be faster than ahead-of-time compilation.  It makes sense to me, since the JIT runtime has more information with which to optimize the code - pypy knows what's going on with the code while it's executing, whereas the hiphop compiler only has information about the code itself.<p>In addition, an implementation in pypy should be able to support eval, which is impossible (or perhaps extremely difficult) with hiphop.",1342252422

(I'm not sure whether to be surprised this made it into the New York Times or not.)<p>> Thanks to the explosion of GPS technology and smartphone apps, these devices are also taking note of what we buy, where and when we buy it, how much money we have in the bank, whom we text and e-mail, what Web sites we visit, how and where we travel, what time we go to sleep and wake up  and more. Much of that data is shared with companies that use it to offer us services they think we want.<p>I have never heard of purchase history, bank balance, alarm clock settings (??? perhaps it refers to carriers supposedly tracking waking hours based on usage? that would make more sense, but is no different from dumb phones), or website history being tracked by anyone through a smartphone.  ""Whom we text"" is tracked, but ""whom we email"" is worth highlighting as an item that <i>cannot</i> be tracked by a carrier without installing malware onto your phone, assuming you use encrypted email.  (The credit card company is tracking your purchases, and email providers may be tracking your email, depending on privacy policy, whether you're using a smartphone or not, but that's irrelevant.  I guess if you count Gmail's algorithms reading email to offer services ""they think we want""... I don't.)<p>> Scholars have called them minicomputers and robots. Everyone is struggling to find the right tag, because cellphone and smartphone are inadequate.<p>That ""phone"" doesn't adequately describe modern smartphones is a valid point, but has literally nothing to do with tracking.<p>> Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia University, argues that they are robots for which we  the proud owners  are merely the hands and feet. They see everything, theyre aware of our position, our relationship to other human beings and other robots, they mediate an information stream around us, he has said.<p>Colorful, but ridiculously vague.  There are many different types of information and they are all stored differently.  With the possible exception of Facebook, there is no entity that sits up high reading all your stuff without a court order, and if you want to have completely secure conversations through email or other means it's easy to do so.<p>> A recent survey by O2, a British cell carrier, showed that making calls is the fifth-most-popular activity for smartphones; more popular uses are Web browsing, checking social networks, playing games and listening to music. Smartphones are taking over the functions that laptops, cameras, credit cards and watches once performed for us.<p>Also irrelevant to tracking.<p>> Turning it off when youre not using it will also help, because it will cease pinging your location to the cell company, but are you really going to do that? Shutting it down does not even guarantee its off  malware can keep it on without your realizing it. The only way to be sure is to take out the battery. Guess what? If you have an iPhone, you will need a tiny screwdriver to remove the back cover. Doing that will void your warranty.<p>If you are really concerned about malware preventing you from turning off your iPhone, you can hold down the home and power buttons to turn it off without going through software.<p>> Dont have a cellphone or just accept that youre living in the Panopticon.<p>A third alternative is to wear a tinfoil hat which will stop all the tracking???<p>> There is another option. People could call them trackers.<p>Okay but if hackers start hijacking peoples' sessions can we start calling them tracker-jackers?<p>Edit: Or more to the point - this is like calling all passerby ""government agents"" because they can be required to testify in court.",1342251572

IVF Lab provides a wide variety of services to the fertility clinic and its patients. In todays time fertility clinic without an ivf lab is unimaginable. Since the birth of the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) or test tube baby in 1978, the field of IVF has been transformed with several technological discoveries and has made the dreams of many infertile couples come true of conceiving their own baby.<p>The embryology laboratory, where embryos are produced, grown and nourished during an IVF cycle, is one of the key components of a fertility center. While patients dont necessarily know what happens behind the scenes during an IVF cycle or how their embryos are produced, having a state-of-the-art embryology laboratory is what separates an average from an excellent fertility center.<p>The embryology laboratory, is a place where embryos are produced, grown and nourished during an IVF cycle and is one of the key components of a fertility center. While patients dont necessarily know what happens behind the scenes during an IVF cycle or how their embryos are produced, having a state-of-the-art embryology laboratory is what separates an average ivf center from an excellent ivf fertility center. In vitro fertilisation treatment takes place in a container in a laboratory. In short the IVF laboratory is the place where the eggs, sperm and embryos are handled and IVF is performed. It is an extremely important part of the IVF process.<p>The question arises is why is an IVF Laboratory needed or it is important for any fertility center?<p>1]\nState of the ART IVF Laboratory\nThe IVF laboratory contains the newest and most advanced equipment for the production of healthy embryos. Incubators are capable of producing a reduced oxygen environment for culturing embryos to the blastocyst stage. Additional laboratory techniques may be performed including extended culturing to the blastocyst stage, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection - ICSI, assisted hatching, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and embryo cryopreservation.<p>2]\nCustomised Video Processing\nAll modern equipments comes with all provision of image processing which is very well utilized by Combination of hardware camera selection and software selection. Multiple Camera inputs can be synthesised in one system to have better recording and processing.<p>3]\nAir Quality evaluation and improvement\nThe environment where the embryos grow is of paramount importance. It has been shown that the air of the laboratory itself can alter the quality of the embryos produced. Embryos are sensitive to microbes, particles and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air. IVF Lab is equipped with most advanced HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) systems to overcome this problem. This system can supply constant temperature and controlled humidity despite climate and seasonal variation to provide a stable environment in order to achieve the maximum performance of all the delicate laboratory equipment. IVF Lab evaluates Air quality on existing Lab and recommend appropriate steps to improve the same. It varies from HVAC inspection to microbial air sampling.<p>4]\nClean Room Laboratory Isolation\nThe laboratory is also isolated from the outside environment by having tightly sealed walls, ceilings, light fixtures utility connections and airtight doors making it impermeable to contaminant agents, microbes and airborne toxins from leaking in. The embryology laboratory is held pressurized above the adjacent procedure rooms so that air moves from the embryology lab to the procedure room and out. This would prevent any contaminant or toxin in the air from coming into the lab through the doors. Laboratories that are poorly designed can lead to decreased pregnancy rates due to embryo toxic materials in the air. Failure to isolate the sensitive and delicate embryo from these materials can lead to increase stress on the developing embryo resulting in decreased pregnancy rates.<p>5]\nEmbryology Services\nIVF Lab provides assistance in providing complete embryology services from Ovum Pick-up to embryo transfer. Qualified and experienced team of clinicians and embryologists carry out these services.<p>Hence it is advisable for fertility clinic to have their own IVF lab or embryology laboratory. The fertility clinic should design the embryology laboratory with one aim of helping their patients to provide the best services and to take home their baby.  Setting up of new laboratory requires contacting designers, architects, sellers, resellers, vendors, suppliers, agents, distributors to initiate slow, long and laborious process of discussing dates and negotiating rates. This, you will agree, will further eat into your most precious commodity ""Time"".<p>There the need arises of a professional person like Shivani Scientific Industries (P) Ltd.

The internet also has privileged nodes which could be used to monitor and control the network or individual nodes.<p>""Tracker"" simply ignores all the service aspects of the device and focuses on a single use for one of the parties involved (costumer, carrier, manufacturer).

Sure if I don't know either of Vimscript or Python, I will see learning Python as more beneficial. But the main reason vim chose vimscript(or emacs chose elisp) is you have a interpreter built in the editor itself. If all your extensions are vimscript, all you need to configure vim on a new box is to copy your .vimrc and .vim folder and everything will work - no package installation, no external dependencies.<p>If you already  know vim and some programming, you can start writing basic vimscript in an hour or two. The more complicated ones(the ones Time Pope writes) are going to take a lot of time, irrespective of your language choice.<p>Also, vim extensions can be written in Python as well, but it requires that your vim has python support.

4243442,comment,4243232,4243232,112,0,kijin,,,"Every time a ""problem"" like this makes the news, the real problem always seems to be overzealous deletionists with their ridiculously strict notability requirement. Gender imbalance might be a problem, but it's not a problem to the same extent as notability-based deletionism is. Notability is an extremely vague standard, a perfect recipe for abuse and selective enforcement. A fair and efficient editorial process should strive to replace vague rules with clearer counterparts whenever possible.<p>Honestly, I cannot think of a good reason to delete <i>any</i> article at all, unless it's obviously fraudulent, marketing-oriented, illegal, or obscene according to a widely accepted definition of obscenity. All of these standards can be applied fairly strictly, and with much less vagueness than notability.<p>- It's not like Wikipedia is short of disk space to store a few million extra text articles.<p>- The argument that it would be too difficult to maintain lots of extra articles is also weak, because not every article needs to be regularly edited, and more articles on niche topics might actually attract more editors.<p>- No, we won't end up with a page for every John Doe and his cat. That's just alarmism. Besides, if something like that ever becomes a problem, a better response would be a prohibition on self-promotion or some other clear guideline, rather than a vague requirement of notability.<p>- If these deletionists are just being OCD and wanting everything to be tidy and clean and under their editorial control, I would say that they need to take a break. In fact, it's possible that people with certain psychological traits self-select for Wikipedia editorship. But the kind of intolerance and self-centered narrow-mindedness that overzealous deletionists exhibit doesn't suit the spirit of a collaborative online project. Keep your OCD to your own home/office and away from public spaces, thank you very much.<p>Right now, I get the impression that it's too easy to flag something for deletion and too difficult to counter the deletionist argument, especially since the deletionists are so familiar with editorial procedures. This inequality needs to change. <i>The burden of proof should be on people who want to remove information from the Web, not on those who want to keep it.</i> Isn't that the same principle that we fought tooth and nail to uphold against the onslaught of SOPA, ACTA, etc?",1342249756

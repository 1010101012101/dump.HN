3603747,comment,3603047,3603537,4,0,hackermom,,,"This isn't just about computational performance. It's just as much about power consumption. Diamondville sits at about 2.5 watts per core, while the A9 sits at under 300 mW per core, totalling to some orders of magnitude better performance per watt. Should we say that the comparison is unfair because of this as well? We could maintain that stance up until the point where we compare two CPUs with identical processing power and power consumption, but somehow that would defeat the purpose of comparing at all. And for the record, they could just as well have brought the Pineview and Cedar Trail cores into the picture, as fresh as the A9, which might've been more ""fair"", but very little still would've changed in computational performance.<p>These tests are really about showing exactly how much you can get out of under a watt of power when opting out of x86.",1329494355

3603745,comment,3603095,3603638,3,0,rdl,,,"The exception is when you're operating in difficult environments, where the cost of putting people there is huge (life support costs, hazard pay, losses, etc.).<p>Space is the obvious example (manned spaceflight might be a good thing politically, or for inspiring people, but no one contests that robots are far more efficient for almost any mission).<p>A closer to home example is commercial diving.  They used to pay people $100-500k/yr to do saturation diving, fairly frequently, at deep sites.  Maybe 3-6 weeks of prep, a ship, a transfer chamber, on-deck chamber, a team of support staff, a team of divers, and lots of equipment.  Instead, now, they send down a ROV (usually operated from the ship above, but conceivably these could be centrally teleoperated someday too, or autonomous).  Commercial divers are still used for smaller tasks, especially where they're not doing saturation diving, but the saturation diving industry in general has been increasingly restricted to shallower jobs or jobs requiring a large amount of work at a single site (involving lots of manual fitting).  For the very deepest dives, ROVs and atmospheric diving suits (basically single-person submarines) have basically taken over -- the deep dive record was set in 1992 and no one has tried to match it.<p>There's also the EOD market (iRobot's packbot), hazmat environments, war zones, etc., where teleoperated equipment will get more and more popular.",1329494340

3603728,comment,3602762,3603496,1,0,Jun8,,,"I was referring to the ""rule"" given in the parent comment about not using the word <i>girl</i> in professional contexts (also implied that it shouldn't be used in other contexts, as well). My point is that stating (or making up) such rules without context is not useful. As an example consider the rule ""Man must wear ties in a professional setting"". Well, there are many of cases where this rule applies, but many other ones where it seems stuck up to wear a tie, you just have to adjust to the context you're in.<p>As to why the article does not use the word <i>boy</i>:<p>1. As I said, such terms are usually used as endearment, for the group you belong to. Phrases like ""Us girls can program, too"", or ""Boys, let's go get this YC interview"" are common and you cannot replace <i>women</i> and <i>men</i> in these contexts. I think the OP was using <i>girl</i> in this sense in her post.<p>2. The correct counterpart to the use of <i>girl</i> seems to be <i>guy</i> (although there are phrases like ""old boy's network"", etc.) mainly, I think, because of alliteration. Some opponents to sexist language are offended by <i>guy</i>, too.<p>To reiterate my point, as hackers let us think about and then act rather than regurgitate rules that may be dictated by others. Let us not do simple string matching for offensive words but set our regular expressions wide to check the context that words are being used.<p>P.S. An interesting parallel to this discussion would be the debate on the use of the N-word, which is considered taboo by many but used by others freely.",1329494046
3603727,comment,3603273,3603273,13,0,Wilduck,,,"I've taught around 20 non-technical people LaTeX. I would say that these are all good tips. But really, the only thing a non-technical person needs to learn LaTeX is to have someone sit down with them and teach them 1 on 1. I have a fairly refined lesson at this point, and can successfully teach anyone LaTeX in 45 minutes to an hour and a half, depending on  how quickly they get it.<p>I've taught mostly undergraduates (while I was one), studying Biology, Chemistry, Linguistics, Psychology, Economics, English, Classics, and Architecture, so I'd like to try to answer the question ""Why?""<p>LaTeX is worth learning if you're regularly writing papers of any length. In all of the disciplines above there's at least one problem with using word that makes composing a paper longer than five pages a huge pain. More often than not LaTeX is able to relieve some of the pain of that process. For example, in Linguistics, sentence trees are fairly easy to create using LaTeX[1], or for a classics paper, being able to switch between typing in Greek or English with a single command is a huge win.[2]<p>Besides the field specific features, there are a lot of other benefits to LaTeX. It's true that just about every person that I've taught LaTeX to has been a little skeptical at first as to what exactly it could provide. The thing that I tell them is that it is incredibly helpful in structuring their document. They end up loving being able to do an outline with section headers, and fill in the body paragraphs. They like having automatic reference and bibliography insertion, and they love being able to comment out sections of their document.<p>I think there's also a reason why it isn't hard to teach a non-technical person LaTeX. When teaching someone a programming language, the student will need to learn or already know a fair amount about how a computer works, and what programming can accomplish. With LaTeX, students generally already know how to write a paper, and will be able to easily map that process in to their learning process.<p>I'm a huge LaTeX evangelist. If you don't already know it, find someone who does, and have them sit down with you for an hour. Ask them to go through the steps of creating a document that has: Sections, subsections, tables, lists, figures, floats, references, and math. By the time you're done, you'll have a good enough knowledge to google for anything you can't reference in the document you just produced. You'll be amazed at how easy it was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ling.upenn.edu/advice/latex/qtree/qtreenotes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ling.upenn.edu/advice/latex/qtree/qtreenotes.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/generic/babel/greek-usage.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/gene...</a>",1329494045

3603693,comment,3603536,3603536,3,0,kls,,,"There is no standard, but what technologies are you planning on using? Personally I would consider using one of the Lisp dialects because they are so easy at writing DSL's you can even write it so that you have a simple DSL that can drop back to full Lisp as people grow in their ability to write rules. What platform are you targeting, if you are targeting the JVM then Clojure would be a good choice, if it is the .net platform then you may have to look at IronScheme are another variant, but they are not as well supported as Clojure. If you have a very specific platform then you could look at using Common Lisp.<p>The reason I would chose a Lisp is due to the ability to rapidly write a DSL, so you can build a tailored language for the rules engine further you can rapidly build variants for industry specific verticals, that conform to the jargon of that industry.<p>My secondary choices would be many of the scripting languages with JavaScript being the top second choice. JavaScript is a good candidate because it is simple to pick up and has a lot of material geared towards the non-programmer.<p>For me personally I would shy away from any languadge that enforces OO, not because I think OO is bad, I am actually a proponent of OO for certain cases, but rather because OO brings a lot of baggage with it that creates barriers for individuals that are not programming as a primary job role.<p>Finally, the idea of Rules engines have been great on paper, the promise of turning the power of decision trees over to business annalist but the reality has not been so favorably to rules engines. Most of the time the responsibility of actually writing the rules is pushed right back to the programmer. So the big thing you have to ask yourself is how is my idea different. I am not trying to be the rotten apple in your pie. I just want to highlight that the promise of rules engines has thus far been marred with failure.

Getting the first page of results from MongoDB or from Redis will yield similar results. However, the greater the offset the worse the performance. In Redis, whether you get the 1st of the 1000000 page, the performance is constant. So, if you are doing paging with large offsets, at scale, a Redis sorted set is almost a must. It's a pretty specific use case, but I think that's what you asked for :). YMMV on the exact #...you should test it..but if, like 95% of all apps,only the first 5 pages are important, it's really a non-issue.<p>Redis sets are great for follows..and you can do some nice set operations on them (which you can't in MongoDB)...so something like which of my friends, and which of your friends, are following the same people. However, if you want to go more than 1 level deep (a graph), Redis isn't great (nor is Mongo for that matter, but it's probably better).<p>Low hanging fruit for Redis would be analytics...both can handle basic analytics, but Redis will handle it faster. For more complex analytics, the two differ substantially...MongoDB will invovled writing Map Reduce...Redis will require that you do the transformation for reports in code. Still, for simple counters...Redis. In fact, maybe this will inspire you:

It's complex; you have to type ridiculous things like ""\textbf"" to get bold text, and ""\begin{enumerate}"" to make a simple list. It's complicated; you have to look up what header argument to make to simply change the margins.

Well, you could analyse your server logs to see which stories you really did click on and which you skipped over (You'll probably want to only consider pages that have at least one click for the edge case of ""I didn't even look at that page"".

HN is only a small fraction of the news I consume, so it wouldn't matter that much to me even if it were a bubble chamber, and
2.

It's the same with big-name authors ditching their publishers to self-publish on Amazon: Sure, they make a mint, more than they would have at a traditional publisher, but they wouldn't have been able to do it were it not for the fan base they built up with their traditionally published works.<p>Everyone loves to bash publisher/distributors in all areas of creative endevour, and often with good reason.  But at their heart these companies are accumulations of capital and expertise that allow risky investment in creative works that might fail.  Everyone who succeeds in the traditional world to the extent that they don't need the publishers anymore got there because that capital took a risk on them; now they don't want to let part of their profits go back into that capital pool.  The question is, if the old system blows up, who takes that risk for unknowns?<p>I'm certainly not saying its impossible.

So, you would need to look at charging $50 / hour for freelance work to hit 50K per year.<p>From my experience, that's about right for freelancing and that's about where you should be charging if you are decent with Wordpress.  I know of other developers who charge at least $50 / hour and don't know a lot of PHP or even JS.  All these developers do all day is configure WP sites.<p>That said, charge what you think you can charge.  The difference between $50 / hour and $80 / hour might simply be what you ask for.<p>Realistically, the size of your digital Rolodex and your ability to sell is what's going to allow you to hit your target rate.  Start networking like crazy and saving as much as possible right now.  Hit Twitter, LinkedIn, Wordpress forums and any other networking channels you can find to see the conversations and hook up the jobs.  As a digital nomad you would be at somewhat of a disadvantage because you wouldn't be able to establish yourself in one location.  That's not to say that you need to work with local clients, but it only helps if you can do it.<p>You could also hit sites like Odesk and Elance but you have a lot of competition there with Wordpress.  You will need something which will allow you to stand out.  The more niche and the more you can stand out the better.  If you can stand out, then good potential client won't even look at the competition offering to work at $15 / hour.<p>So, aside from networking, you need to do whatever you can to try to establish yourself as an authority.  Create a site, write articles and contribute to the community.  Work to make a voice which other WP developers will take seriously.  Continue to learn WP and read as much as you can to find out what people are doing to push the envelope with it.<p>You could branch out into other areas aside from WP, but you should start with your strengths.  You could focus on HTML / CSS but combining that with Wordpress will give you a more niche target.<p>Try to save up at least six months living expenses before you hit the freelance circuit.<p>Hold off on travel until you have had a chance to get solidly into the flow of bringing in work.  Also, freelancing while on the road is difficult.  You might benefit from moving somewhere with cheap living expenses though.",1329491078

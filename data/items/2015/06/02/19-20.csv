Both original houses were around 800 sqft, and eventually expanded to around 1600 sqft over the course of decades.  According to the US census bureau [0] the median new home constructed in the US is around 2100 sqft.  If you dig deeper into the data [1] you&#x27;ll find that the characteristics of housing in the US have changed drastically since the days of mostly single-income households -- homes are much larger, with more amenities.  The average dwelling for someone <i>below the poverty line</i> right now is bigger and has better amenities than the average dwelling <i>for Americans as a whole</i> in 1970.<p>One pair of my grandparents is still living, in the same house.  Houses that have sold on their block in the last few months were all around 800 sqft and went for an average of $95,000 -- which is an affordable 3.2 times the median income in the neighborhood (it&#x27;s a poor neighborhood.)  A single earner <i>can</i> provide a house, provided it&#x27;s a house similar to what single earners could provide decades ago -- but there aren&#x27;t many of those on the market.  We keep building bigger houses and then wonder why the poor can&#x27;t afford to keep up.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/const/C25Ann/sftotalmedavgsqft.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html</a>",1433275174

For people who are still inclined to worry about standardized tests, I will mention that this preparation course will undoubtedly provide useful cross-training for the ACT college admission test and for many other standardized tests. If you are still worried after all that, I have one more tip about standardized tests, a tip that has worked to make all such tests easy for me and for my children.<p>READ, READ<p>To learn how to score well on a standardized test reading section, the number one piece of advice is READ, READ, READ, and READ. Read about what you like to know more about. Read things that are fun for you. Find books and magazines about interesting topics and read them. Turn off the TV and read. Put away the video game controller and read. Read hard things, and read easy things. Read a lot.<p>For years, I wondered why it came so readily to mind to write &quot;READ, READ, READ&quot; in all capital letters like that when I give advice on this subject, as I have frequent occasion to do. Recently, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). Yes, that works for Chinese, and it works for English too. By practicing reading, you gain reading comprehension and reading speed, and speedy reading with good comprehension gives you time to complete standardized test sections with time to spare. That reduces the pressure and lets you relax and think while you take the test. Try it. You may like it, and anyway reading is fun.",1433275170

You sit at your editor, think about what changes you want to make, and then key in a set of precision commands in vim-editing-language and it happens.<p>>This way v replaces viw, vaw, vi&quot;, va&quot;, vi(, va(, vi[, va[, vi{, va{, vip, vap, vit, vat, ... you get the idea.<p>I kind of like the precision of having all of those different things, and of course the option of using them for more than just visual select but also change, delete, and so on. Although I suppose this doesn&#x27;t remove any of those keymappings, I must protest remapping Ctrl+v: I can&#x27;t even use an editor without block select.<p>I imagine there&#x27;s a plugin (or even builtin feature) that at least generalises &quot;s, (s , [s, tags and things of that sort though.<p>>Stop that stupid window from popping up:\n>map q: :q<p>I know it&#x27;s a weird and irritating thing to have that window pop up when you meant to quit, but it&#x27;s actually a very neat interface: a whole vim buffer for recomposing commands and your command history for later execution (almost acme-like). Give the poor guy a chance.<p>As a counterpoint to what I&#x27;ve pointed out above, I&#x27;d like to recommend Drew Neil&#x27;s [<i>Practical Vim</i>](<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Progra...</a>) to anyone who hasn&#x27;t read it already. It&#x27;s got a lot of great content, and really goes a long way to explain vim&#x27;s quirks and methods of doing things.<p>One of the useful tips I learnt from that was the ex command &quot;normal&quot;, which allows you to execute a string of normal mode commands over a range of lines. So, for example, you can append a semicolon to each line in a visual selection by entering<p><pre><code>    :&#x27;<,&#x27;>%normal A;\n</code></pre>\nA small thing, but one that I&#x27;ve used a lot since learning about it.",1433275159

While Thunderbolt has in theory always been able of supporting external graphics (it’s just a PCIe bus), the biggest hold-up has always been handling what to do about GPU hot-plugging and the so-called “surprise removal” scenario. Intel tells us that they have since solved that problem, and are now able to move forward with external graphics. The company is initially partnering with AMD on this endeavor – though nothing excludes NVIDIA in the long-run – with concepts being floated for both a full power external Thunderbolt card chassis, and a smaller “graphics dock” which contains a smaller, cooler (but still more powerful than an iGPU) mobile discrete GPU.",1433275022

All text is anchored to integer multiples of a basic vertical distance unit, which (If I remember correctly) is the distance between the baselines of the smallest font-size that to be used.<p>&quot;baseline&quot; => The line the text &#x27;sits&#x27; on, which defines the &quot;origin&quot; of the letters vertically. (at least in the greater Latin-based family of languages). The lowercase letters generally span the distance (of one &quot;x-height&quot; or &quot;ex&quot; in CSS) between the &quot;baseline&quot; and the &quot;median&quot;. Some letters (including most capitals) extend higher to a hight higher than the median, and some letters have &quot;descenders&quot; that extend below the baseline. The point is that the baseline is the fixed point of reference we use when drawing the letters (i.e. cursive handwriting, which usually returns to the baseline between letter.<p>The idea of using these concepts in page layout is based on the idea that the pattern-matching our brain does to parse our vision is always trying to find signal <i>everywhere</i>. Therefor, if we help it a bit by putting <i>EVERYTHING</i> - as measured from the anchors the brain uses - into a simple pattern, it will be recognized faster. To accomplish this you have make it so interval between the baselines of the normal body-text <i>continues</i> (perhaps as a multiple of that interval) into the h[1-6], li, custom divs, everything. You should be able to lay hypothetical ruled paper over the page and have <i>all</i> the text sit nicely on the paper&#x27;s lines.<p>This is kind of hard to do in CSS, as you have use the line-height/margin/padding/border to fill the remainder of the baseline interval height and the current tag&#x27;s font size. It can get <i>really</i> messy if you have a lot of different tag-to-tag situations or strange margins. There are tools (e.g. SASS/SCSS libraries) to assist, but you really have to include this idea from the beginning of the project or face the possibility of needing &quot;minor corrections&quot; everywhere.<p>I doubt there is much of a measurable benefit from these techniques - it&#x27;s not going to make everybody read your pages twice as fast. On the other hand, I would agree with you that it can kind look really nice. Just paying attention to typography and layout <i>at all</i> can make all the difference between a readable page and a noisy mess.<p>A few pages that describe this in further detail:<p><a href=""http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm</a><p><a href=""http://alistapart.com/article/settingtypeontheweb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/article/settingtypeontheweb</a><p><a href=""https://medium.com/written-in-code/aligning-type-to-baseline-the-right-way-using-sass-e258fce47a9b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/written-in-code/aligning-type-to-baseline...</a>",1433275005

I interned at Microsoft last summer and everything was great. I loved the work I was doing, they loved me and I was offered a full-time position after I graduated (I was supposed to graduate in May). In the job offer that I accepted, they had me set a start date and I picked August 10th.<p>Here&#x27;s where things get messy. Over the last two semesters, I have been struggling both with depression as well as with motivation in my classes. Because of everything, I failed some classes and would need the fall semester to finish my Bachelor&#x27;s Degree. I have been seeking help from a medical professional at my university and I&#x27;m taking summer classes, but as I&#x27;m picking up the pieces I feel incredibly overwhelmed.<p>So, my question is what should I do? Would Microsoft push my start date back to allow me to graduate? Should I just not tell them and hope they don&#x27;t notice? (finish my degree in a couple years) Am I totally screwed?

For months now, we&#x27;ve heard appalling testimony from women who escaped Isis&#x27;s clutches, many of whom endured rape and other hideous acts of violence.&quot;<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s a chilling excerpt: &quot;After attacking a village, [the Islamic State] splits women from men and executes boys and men aged 14 and over. The women and mothers are separated; girls are stripped naked, tested for virginity and examined for breast size and prettiness. The youngest, and those considered the prettiest virgins fetch higher prices and are sent to Raqqa, the IS stronghold.&quot;<p>&quot;We heard about one girl who was traded 22 times, and another, who had escaped, told us that the sheikh who had captured her wrote his name on the back of her hand to show that she was his &#x27;property&#x27;.&quot;<p>&quot;Estimates vary, but there are believed to be somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 women enslaved by the Islamic State. Many are Yazidis, a persecuted minority sect that the extremist Islamic State considers to be apostate &quot;devil-worshippers,&quot; in part because of the Yazidis&#x27; ancient connection to the region&#x27;s pre-Islamic past. The jihadists&#x27; treatment of Yazidi women, in particular, has been marked out by its contempt and savagery.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s Bangura again: &quot;They commit rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and other acts of extreme brutality. We heard one case of a 20-year-old girl who was burned alive because she refused to perform an extreme sex act. We learned of many other sadistic sexual acts. We struggled to understand the mentality of people who commit such crimes.&quot;",1433273231

You are again apparently endorsing it, but only for your own labor.<p>All that pain and all that sacrifice are worth exactly zero.  You have ownership of the company because your name is on the incorporation papers, and your investors haven&#x27;t diluted you too much yet.  There is no moral justification there.  You deserve the money because you have some combination of luck, money, and business acumen that got you to the right place fastest.  You don&#x27;t deserve it because you have a sad-sack sob-story about how hard it was for you to get it.  Just be happy it&#x27;s yours and not your closest competitor&#x27;s, and try not to pat yourself on the back too hard.  You&#x27;re not a better person, you just got there first.<p>I am not disputing that you are legally entitled to all the fruits of your business.  I am disputing that there is any moral justification whatsoever for you to be an asshole to the other people that helped it grow.  You can rationalize it to yourself all you like.  The money is yours because your name is on the paperwork, period.  That&#x27;s the way it has to be, because otherwise all the 7 billion idiots, each with different ideas about how ownership and valuation should work, would add too much friction to business.<p>Your justifying arguments sound to me like Divine Right of Kings or Manifest Destiny.  It&#x27;s the crap you feed to the proles to keep them from getting mad at you.  You&#x27;re not the boss because you work harder or you are more skilled.  You&#x27;re the boss because your name is on all the documents.  You don&#x27;t actually <i>need</i> to work harder or better or longer to justify your ownership.  Your name is still on the paper.  You do all that to justify your <i>market share</i>.<p>It&#x27;s nice that you can afford to go six months with no paycheck.  But you&#x27;re not, really.  You&#x27;re not wasting your time; you&#x27;re investing it in something you own in the hope that you will earn a return on it.  The typical employee won&#x27;t work for free, because they have no actual equity in the business, and they still have living expenses to pay.  You&#x27;re not stupid, and neither are they.<p>There is no moral principle in play here.  No matter how much or how little an employee feels justified in wanting a percentage instead of a constant, the owner decides who gets what, because their name is on the paper, and the compromises we have made as a society in building up trade law have determined that is the important factor.<p>So if you sold out, you too could take the cash and walk out without saying goodbye.  It would be completely legal.  Your employees (and much of the rest of the world) would still be free to think you are a morally bankrupt prick.  Scratch that.  A <i>rich</i>, morally bankrupt prick, who might yet start a new business and hire them again.  So they won&#x27;t burn any bridges with you.  But you won&#x27;t make any friends that way either.<p>Compare Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.  Jobs got stinking rich, and everybody thought he was an insufferable pantload.  Wozniak got less in cash, and far more in respect.  Jobs was better at the names-on-papers game.  Woz is better at the human empathy game.<p>In the end, your moral calculus will always have your own personal perspectives as a factor.  Just forget about that.  You&#x27;re not a better person, you just have your name on more papers.  And above all, stop trying to bullshit us into believing that the people who own morally deserve to get all that they take.  You get what you get because our system would break in unpredictable and probably horrible ways if you didn&#x27;t.<p>It isn&#x27;t because you&#x27;re awesome.

Let&#x27;s just go ahead and print their recruiting posters too, while we&#x27;re at it.<p>This is long, but it&#x27;s well worth the read.

I think IS and what they&#x27;re doing are heinous and disgusting. But to <i>react</i> to what they&#x27;re doing and try to stop them with force of arms will be massively counter-productive. Sometimes, blowing shit up just makes it worse. I mean, IS <i>wouldn&#x27;t even be a thing</i> if the US hadn&#x27;t blown up Iraq. How, exactly, is doubling down a good idea, again?<p>In the days immediately after 9/11, I said in an online forum to some friends that I <i>really</i> didn&#x27;t want the US to spend the next several decades playing Whack-a-Mole with the jihad-inclined parts of Islam. Guess what we&#x27;ve done, and what you seem to be calling for doing...",1433271766

Still ok?<p>Americans are ok with surveillance technology as long as its use is limited. The American system for limiting it has always been focused on the exclusion of evidence. If the state violated the 4th Amendment (like parking a listening van without a warrant), the evidence could be excluded from trial and the surveilled person is less likely to convicted.<p>The government is now pivoting to the concept of national security to get around all these limitations. If the FBI is not investigating a crime, it does not care about the 4th Amendment. Terrorism is defined as an act of war--not a crime--so as long as the FBI is doing &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; it can just collect all information about whatever it wants, whenever it wants, with no limitations.

Frankly I never believed it and (IMHO) you have to be pretty ignorant of Apple to think the rumours had any credence whatsoever.<p>The upgrade cycles are simply too long for TVs.<p>But more importantly, Apple&#x27;s whole model is to treat things like this as just &quot;dumb complements&quot;. Your mobile device is, from the carrier&#x27;s perspective, is increasingly becoming an a dumb Internet pipe (first with the App Store, later with the likes of iMessages and how LTE works, etc).<p>The TV for Apple is simply a dumb display to stick an Apple TV into. A sub-$100 device you can replace every other year if need be. A $3000 TV is replaced a whole lot less often.<p>Why would Apple want to be in the business of (eventually) supporting 5+ year old TVs for such a low-margin business? Or what makes you think users would pay for the Apple brand and/or upgrade more often to make it worthwhile?<p>So as far as IoT goes, I have trouble seeing a future where someone says &quot;I need to buy new lightbulbs because mine don&#x27;t get firmware updates anymore&quot; or &quot;I need to buy a new fridge because it can&#x27;t talk to my new phone&quot;.",1433271608

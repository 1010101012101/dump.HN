He liked living in Paris, and really wanted more of his team there, but the regulations around hiring employees were a big issue for him. If I recall rightly, it wasn&#x27;t so much the paperwork or the benefits, but the extra burdens around firing. So he was hiring all his new people in CA.<p>Here in California, most employment is at will, meaning that either party can end the relationship immediately. I can quit without notice; I can be fired without notice. (In practice, notice is generally given, but that&#x27;s custom, not a legal right.

California tried something similar but then got swept up in the Mexican-American War. Even West Florida was &quot;independent&quot; for a few months before being annexed by the US, and of course the rest of Florida was Spanish but neglected by Madrid.<p>So it is not that hard to imagine a Florida army going to war in Afghanistan, while Texas invaded Mexico and California remained neutral. If they had not been annexed by the US, they would likely either ally the US or have animosity with their southern neighbors due to strained relations from their independence wars.<p>Also, theoretically a governor can refuse to deploy the state&#x27;s National Guard. I could find one instance where in California, Governor Schwarzenegger declined the President&#x27;s request to send National Guard troops to the border with Mexico.

However, being mostly a userspace solution its latency and throughput are not ideal. A full transaction consisting of method call and method reply requires 10 (!) copy operations for the messages passed. It is only useful for transfer of control messages, and not capable of streaming larger amounts of data.

So yeah he tried to sell performance as the big thing for his version of dbus IPC. I&#x27;m guessing he (and group) spent more time with dbus than linus and failed to find the actual  cause of the performance issue or tried to hide it give more credence to kdbus. In both cases it makes it that much harder to trust their reasoning and conclusions.<p>I never said kdbus is ONLY about performance. But from what I&#x27;m reading they are not performance people but they think they are. The most dangerous people are those who don&#x27;t know their own limitation or weakness.

Imagine he says to the owner, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m going to pay you €418 to drive one of your cars back and forth between your stores for two days. You do all the paperwork as if I&#x27;m renting the car 36 times. And then you buy €3000 worth of air miles and give them to me. How about it?&quot;<p>No rational business owner would do that. They only reason Avis did that is that they are so large that they can&#x27;t run it sensibly; instead, like programmers, they try to construct systems of rules that approximate a sane business. This guy found a bug in the system, forcing Avis to do something that is definitely not in their best interests.<p>It&#x27;s a smart and well-constructed scam, but it&#x27;s definitely a scam. And the guy knows it. He carefully tests Avis rules. He works around Avis&#x27;s safeguards. He knew not to push it too far, which is why he limited it to two days. And I&#x27;ll lay good money right now that there&#x27;s already some programmer at Avis who is writing code to look for reservations like this and automatically consolidate them, as well as a lawyer who&#x27;s wondering how to change the T&Cs to prevent this.<p>As to the latter bit, that is true of any scammer.

Pick up a new programming skill, unrelated to games.

Put together a couple rudimentary prototypes within this discipline; open source them to GitHub, apply with those.<p>Less Intelligent Paths:<p>3. Try to form an Indie studio -now.

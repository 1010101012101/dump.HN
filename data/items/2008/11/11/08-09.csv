Seeing some potential, I had bought a <i>very</i> nice domain and started a news website on Joomla. Although I have never promoted it, search engines have picked it up and its captured some very fine keywords. \nHowever, I am facing some specific roadblocks in this project where your suggestions will be of immense help:<p>1) CMS - Joomla is OK, but I am not too excited about it. I looked around the net but did not came upon any news-specific CMS. What CMS + addons will you recommend for the site?<p>2) Humans. I single handedly can only contribute to a limit. I am considering getting some more people in. Is it a better idea to get a copywriter who can reproduce articles based on my idea or someone with knowledge about the subject matter (who may not be be well versed with the fine art of web copywriting). Also, where do you get to recruit good people?<p>3) If you have run a news site, any other tips you may have.<p>Thanks everyone.",1226392810

Some insect, weather pattern or bacteria or something that just wrecks the entire crop for a few years.<p>There almost was sometime around 1990.  A killer strain of some corn disease was going around and there was serious concern that corn would go extinct.  Then someone found a resistant strain somewhere in Mexico and hybridization did the rest.<p>A friend of mine who happens to be allergic to corn was one of the people tracking the spread of the disease.

You're done a fundamentally good thing, in my opinion.<p>To catch a thief: I think it's very revealing that the person who was able to recognize this was somebody who has spoofed accounts themselves, and who has insulted other people ""a lot"" on HN and therefore knew the normal response.<p>I kind of hope that the perpetrator also has an opportunity to redeem themselves - and who perhaps, one day, might be enabled to do something similarly good as a direct result.",1226391797

I try to name my heavy-lifting methods so that they do not look like simple accessors, but sometimes it is inevitable.<p>For instance, a large dataset may have a method to get the length of the dataset.  If the dataset does not maintain a member variable that has that value, then you have to calculate it.  Later, for performance, you might implement an ivar that is updated whenever the dataset changes, thus making the method a simple accessor.",1226391400

My previous building only had TWC.<p>The problem with having a monopoly over providing retail Internet access is, well, that you have a monopoly. This is what infuriates me about the position of cable companies demanding Netflix pay to &quot;push&quot; bytes onto their networks.<p>No one is pushing anything. The customers of cable companies are _paying_ for Internet access and using that bandwidth to access services on the Internet that include Netflix.<p>The only reason cable companies even care is because Netflix provides competition to cable TV.<p>This situation can only exist because there are regional monopolies and for some reason the US just loves pretending regional monopolies are somehow &quot;competition&quot;. Look at the Baby Bell situation as an earlier example.<p>In Australia, most people have only 1 physical option for fixed-line broadband, being Telstra, which was the government telco but has since been privatized. A few places also have cable Internet, typically over HFC, from Foxtel (owned by Telstra) or Optus.<p>I say &quot;physical option&quot; because the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission; think of it like the FTC/FCC but without quite so much regulatory capture) some years ago forced Telstra to provide space in exchanges for rivals to put DSLAMs to provide ADSL service. Telstra receives income from this and tries their damndest to undermine this situation but the fact is you can get Internet from a bunch of providers because of it.<p>10+ years ago ADSL2+ was pretty decent. Now it&#x27;s a tad archaic. Many people don&#x27;t have >2Mbps due to distance from the exchange.<p>The US solution is to encourage overbuilds. This is not a good solution. For one, it&#x27;s a waste to deploy so many networks. For another, providers will cherry pick areas leaving many with still a single provider.<p>What you need is forced separation of retail and wholesale. I think the Australian example provides good evidence for this.<p>Wholesalers need to be denied the ability to sell to retail customers and they need to provide the same terms to all retailers.<p>The previous government in Australia brought in the NBN (Next generation Broadband Network), which was to be FTTH for the vast majority of Australians. Deployment was slow and only a few areas got hooked up. Despite what anyone says, the cost was going to be way more than the government quoted (A$42B originally). The new government has essentially decided on a mix of technologies, being FTTH, HFC and FTTN.<p>FTTN is fiber to a box in the street and then copper cable the rest of the way. With VDSL2, you can probably get to 100Mbps this way. Recent trials of G.Fast have I think raised this to 1Gbps. So it&#x27;s not a terrible solution. It&#x27;s certainly not FTTH however.<p>There is antitrust precedent for forced separation of services, like the Hollywood Antitrust case of 1948 [1]. This separated studios, distributors and theaters.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Title II is the answer here either. US regulation has been pretty terrible (eg the breakup of AT&T into the Baby Bells).<p>Still, most people do have one electricity provider and utility rules do prevent them from price gouging since electricity, gas and water are essential services. I believe that Internet access will be---or arguably already is--an essential service in much the same way.<p>Whatever the case, building more networks is a pretty terrible solution to the problem.<p>[1] US vs Paramount Pictures Inc.

Problem solved!&quot; &quot;Sad? Cheer up! Thats what I do!&quot;<p>However, on the opposite side, sometimes you do just have to grit your teeth and get started.<p>Anecdotally, a few years ago I was in a outdoor shopping center and noticed a boxing gym tucked away behind some other store-fronts. And in that moment, I said &quot;fuck it, I&#x27;m going to learn to box&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t particularly in shape, nor is &quot;fighting&quot; really in my social demeanor; I&#x27;m kinda of a pacifist. It was awkward, difficult, and at times painful.

At the time Chrome was released, it was the only browser with this design, because it&#x27;s much easier to do when starting from scratch. Chrome benefited greatly simply from observing the design decisions of Firefox, IE, etc. that had had several years to play out by that point.<p>In ten years (assuming Chrome is still around then), it will also have similarly antiquated design decisions that make sense to us now, but will be frustrating and obsolescent a decade from now. It doesn&#x27;t mean that Chrome won&#x27;t be able to keep up at all with these changes eventually; it just means that it&#x27;s not great to compare a brand-new browser with one that&#x27;s been around (and used!)[0] for a long time.<p>Electrolysis (the name for the project) took much longer in Firefox because they had to essentially retrofit an existing browser that hadn&#x27;t been designed this way from the start.<p>[0] If Firefox hadn&#x27;t had significant market share, it could have made this change much more rapidly without fear of breaking things for existing users. But of course, making sure the browser remains stable for its millions of users is a top priority as well, alongside developing these new features.",1423852777

Naive Bayes is called Naive because it assumes that all regressors (x_j) are independent given the target variable (let&#x27;s call it y and assume it is binary). In other words, the conditional log odds of y=1 given the x_j variables is equal to the sum of the log density ratios, where the log density ratio for variable x_j is ln(f(x_j|y=1)/f(x_j|y=0)).<p>On the other hand, in the price elasticity example described in post we want to infuse outside knowledge into the model because we don&#x27;t believe what it says on its own. This is a situation where interpretation and believability is an important part of the objective function because we will be running future pricing scenarios from the model.<p>If you are building, say, a churn model to predict who is going to cancel their accounts, you probably wouldn&#x27;t infuse your model with outside knowledge since cross validation accuracy is your main goal. You might regularize your model, however, which can be done in a number of ways (Bayesian or non-Bayesian).

We are more likely to report being stalked and harassed on the Internet—of the 3,787 people who reported harassing incidents from 2000 to 2012 to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent were female. Sometimes, the abuse can get physical: A Pew survey reported that five percent of women who used the Internet said “something happened online” that led them into “physical danger.” And it starts young: Teenage girls are significantly more likely to be cyberbullied than boys. Just appearing as a woman online, it seems, can be enough to inspire abuse. In 2006, researchers from the University of Maryland set up a bunch of fake online accounts and then dispatched them into chat rooms.<p>> Accounts with feminine usernames incurred an average of 100 sexually explicit or threatening messages a day. Masculine names received 3.7.<p><a href=""http://time.com/3305466/male-female-harassment-online/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/3305466/male-female-harassment-online/</a><p>> [W]omen’s harassment is more likely to be gender-based and that has specific, discriminatory harms rooted in our history. The study pointed out that the harassment targeted at men is not because they are men, as is clearly more frequently the case with women. It’s defining because a lot of harassment is an effort to put women, because they are women, back in their “place.”",1423852321

It doesn&#x27;t say anything about how efficiently it can do it. For example, a conventional computer and a quantum computer can both do integer factorization.

The problem is that I have a family that naturally consumes a lot of my time. That means I don&#x27;t control when I&#x27;m available to communicate. I get a decent amount of total time, but it&#x27;s in bits and pieces spread throughout the day (mostly early morning or at night).<p>That&#x27;s perfectly fine for asynchronous communication like email, SO, here, etc. But it doesn&#x27;t work for synchronous things like IRC.<p>So, using &quot;are they on IRC&quot; as a hiring signal, I believe, effectively punishes people who have families, busy work schedules, or otherwise complex lives. In other words, I think it ends up favoring affluent young people. That&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d personally be keen on biasing for in my hiring process given how much of an advantage that group already has in technical jobs.",1423851970

One can certainly take a mature pointer analysis and use the results to determine escape sets and do the same optimizations of course, which I think is what you&#x27;re saying.

9045895,comment,9044719,9045181,0,0,rayiner,,,"> I live in Virginia and have access to ZERO wired providers and zero wireless -- all we have is satellite. That&#x27;s because the state allowed Verizon and others to chomp up the lucrative northern Virginia market with FIOS without requiring that they upgrade the rest of their wired switching equipment in less-populated areas. So Verizon makes money on the nicest part of the market -- and the rest of us get nothing. And this is from a company using eminent domain to provide their service.<p>The eminent domain thing is a red herring. Most places in northern VA, fiber is routed along utility poles owned by the power company, or in underground conduits owned by the power company. In any case, being allowed to run some cables <i>at their own cost</i> in no way justifies forcing them to build miles and miles of fiber in the middle of nowhere.<p>The Virginia market is actually a great example of how telecom should work. There are relatively fewer regulatory barriers, so companies build infrastructure in places it makes sense to do so. My parents have 150 mbps cable or 75 mbps fiber because they live in a close-in suburb where people can afford to pay enough to justify that investment.<p>In contrast, the dense, wealthy neighborhood next door to where I live in Baltimore has no fiber service, even though Verizon has fiber in several buildings mere blocks away. Why? Because the city&#x27;s quid pro quo for allowing Verizon to wire up anyone with fiber was wiring up the vast swaths of the city where it makes no economic sense to do so. And the end result is that nobody gets fiber.",1423850898

During the daytime, my speed is usually around the advertised 6mb down/0.75 up. But in the evenings and on weekends, I frequently see it drop to 0.5/0.1 or less. During the past year I&#x27;ve had a dozen or more outages, including two that lasted for a day or more.<p>When I want to download something quickly (or just open a web page some evenings), I tether to my cellphone which thankfully has unlimited LTE service because I&#x27;ve refused to sign a new contract. (Speeds are around ~18/5 if I put the phone in my front window.)<p>A guy working at Time Warner (which provides 50mb service about 0.5 miles from my house) said it would cost around $22k for them to wire up my neighborhood and that was too much for them.<p>After that, I&#x27;ve started looking into what it would take to run my own fiber lines to my neighborhood. It looks like it&#x27;d cost me that much or more, which is not an insurmountable amount, but it is significant. And I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any way I could ever hope to make it profitable.<p>Edit: Oh, and I forgot to mention: my price has gone up twice during the past year - I&#x27;m now paying ~$65/month.<p>Second edit: I just realized that my service doesn&#x27;t qualify as &quot;broadband&quot;, even under the FCC&#x27;s <i>old</i> definition.

So your home would monitor what you do and try to replicate it. I&#x27;m not confident - take an application like Word, they are still irritating after decades of intellisense and a somewhat controlled and restricted environment.<p>The only one that could work I think would be an Apple bludgeon approach. Your front door and lights and heater work all together nicely following 1 strict scenario.

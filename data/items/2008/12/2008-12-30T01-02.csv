413780,comment,413656,413656,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'd get out.<p>There will always be disagreements in a startup.  But you should never feel like you dread seeing your cofounder.  If it's seriously making you stressed and depressed, give it up.  Startups should at least make you feel energized and enthusiastic, even if they aren't exactly ""fun"".  If you can't muster that sort of passion, you're probably already doomed.<p>The successful teams I've worked on had plenty of disagreements and ""we're doomed"" moments.  But then we'd work things out, come to an agreement, and everything would be great again.  The unsuccessful teams were the ones where we just didn't respect the people we were working with.  When things went wrong, it was their fault, and they never made rational decisions, and why were we working together anyway?<p>BTW, there's a lot to be said for quitting <i>before</i> you're broke.  It gives you negotiating leverage when you apply for your next job, and can increase your options as far as possible jobs.  (For example, I'm moving across the country for my next job, and finding that if I did not have a lot of cash reserves saved up, I'd run into serious cash-flow problems.  Good companies will help pay for your move, but you usually need the money before you officially start with them.)",1230601204

So unless someone is writing hundreds of words in each sample, they're unlikely to be distinguishable from the crowd. That, to me, rules out typical comments on threads. Lots of little samples seem to be just too noisy with too much overlap among authors to allow for unique information-based fingerprints.<p>However, if the data is sufficiently large - in number and length (say, lots of essay-type blog posts) I'd expect some classifier-based machine learning techniques could match authors. That is, take a sample of 100 bloggers, split their data in half, train the classifiers on one half then test to match up the other half of the data. Under those conditions you could probably get 90-95% accuracy.<p>The question, I think, is how small you could push the training set in terms of the fewest words and the fewest posts.",1230600814

413771,comment,413242,413338,0,0,stcredzero,,,"As someone who has taught music to adults, I can corroborate:<p>There is definitely a change in the brain that happens if you are heavily exposed to playing an instrument or otherwise making music at and before 11 to 12 years of age.  Adults who do not have this are handicapped like they are missing some sort of sense.  The difference is like the difference between an immigrant's adopted language and that same language as spoken by their children.<p>The former can work really, really hard and speak quite fluently and have the grammar and most of the accent tamed as to speak very elegantly and understandably, but they almost never get rid of the last vestiges of that accent.<p>If you want your children to truly learn music, then hang out with and have fun with people who do music effortlessly and for the sheer fun of it.  This means that you go to jam sessions at private houses.  Anything that remotely smells like a performance won't work the same way.  Expose them to music done purely for the fun of it.<p>If you want to learn music as an adult, you have to learn how to hear again.  The immigrant in the first example can think he's speaking perfectly, even though native speakers clearly hear that he is not.  You have to learn how to hear again.  You have to become directly aware sound stimulus, unfiltered through the higher-level notions you've developed about it.  Then you have to correlate that with what happens when you manipulate your instrument.  Keep doing that for 3 to 5 years.<p>I should add that, while I was <i>exposed</i> to music at an early age, I didn't really take joy in it until I discovered Irish Traditional music at the age of 19.  I knew back then, that it would be impossible for me to accomplish much.  I just thought if I could learn just this one tune.  Then I learned a second tune.  Then I went through a period of time when I was feverishly listening to tapes of myself and comparing what I heard myself play to recordings of masters for 8 hours a day sometimes.  Eventually, I got good enough to teach at a school for Irish Music in the US and even qualified to compete at the Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann, which is basically the world competition.<p>My journey was two decades.

Since he is really the one funding this and I simply need to support myself, I bit onto it. My passion was building a company that was great to work at. That passion, however is almost gone, as I don't like my 'job' anymore. Maybe I am incapable of creating that environment with this partner/project? Maybe that environment just comes about organically? I really feel like much of what have been done so far has been forced. The problem is I dont know what the successful startup guys feel like in this situation. I dont know how I am supposed to know when it is 'right' because I have never started a successful company. Do they force it? Or does it fall into place? Is it supposed to feel like trudging through 5 feet of snow everyday? Or is that when it goes wrong? Is it normal to burn out on the project and dealing with trying to patch the partnership after only 6 months?<p>I think it really comes down to this ""I cant fail"" mentality I have. I want out, but that is failing. That is giving up. I don't give up.<p>I used to be sooo optimistic.<p>I appreciate the discussion. And I hope my end does not just come off as a rant.",1230600098

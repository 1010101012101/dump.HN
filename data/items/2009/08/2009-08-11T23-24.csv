This attitude is especially prevalent on sites like this. Unfortunately, much like our own estimation of our own driving ability in comparison to our view of the driving abilities of everyone else it is easy to see a strong degree of cognative bias in our answers.<p>The reason that no one cares too much about an age line like this is that it hits everyone equally and eventually you will age past it. During the years immediately following this event you will see it as as unjust but you demographic insignificance will prevent any real change. Only when you can look back with the benefit of a decade or more of life-experience and hard-won wisdom will you be able to really make an objective judgement; restrictions that were unjust or ill advised from this perspective might change, but I would not expect much to appear unwise...",1250034926
756830,comment,756407,756529,0,0,hedgehog,,,"The data doesn't support high school working out for 95% of students.<p>Fewer than 70% of US high school students graduate with their class. Few districts do better than 80%. About 3% or so homeschool, so that leaves you with about 67% who graduate in the system.<p>The 2005 data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that 34% of 12th graders rated ""proficient"" reading abilities.<p>Not exactly a glowing success.<p>There are good options if you're looking for alternatives. I know a bit about the situation in Seattle because I opted out of high school there. The school district there has a ""school"" set up where home schoolers can register, do some non-home friendly classes (science & theater mostly IIRC), and benefit from government education funding. Many cities have programs that let high schoolers get credit for taking college classes and some universities are set up to do early admission (I did the UW program). Before all that I did an apprenticeship at a small electronics company (age 13). Pretty much you need to do the legwork though, you may find that the school district isn't interested in helping students leave the system (taking their funding with them).",1250034901

756821,comment,756407,756407,0,0,lionhearted,,,"It's not a terribly good use of time for people who actually like to learn. I dropped out of two high schools, including a gifted and talented program - who the hell knows how I got into that one, but I dropped it as well. It really seemed like obedience school to me - capricious, arbitrary, with a focus on discipline and not on learning. A number of times, I would fail a class where I was in the top five most talented people in it. I didn't see much point in doing what they prescribed - I'd rather go explore the world or play around on a computer or read books or go make some money.<p>I left home at 16, and eventually wound up graduating high school by going into an adult learning center at age 17 or so. I said, ""I am fully emancipated, and living as an adult. I would like to complete the adult program."" After some talking with a very nice fellow and being politely evasive, he agreed. I took a series of competency exams, completed the silliest multiple choice packet of American history I've ever seen, and I was awarded a diploma. I went and took the standardized tests and got into university. They were kind enough to loan or grant me almost my full tuition, though I dropped out of university once as well. Same reasons.<p>Anywho, with a quick perusal of history, it's pretty obvious that maturity does not come from age, it comes from having unique experiences and learning from them. If you see someone who is forced to become ""head of household"" at a young age due to parents illness and cares for his/her siblings, they are very mature and adultlike even in their mid-teens. Likewise, people dragged into a war move differently, with less naivete - characteristics you'd usually see in someone in their 40's. There's kids in their mid-20's with that look.<p>At least, that's the hypothesis I made: Unique experiences and learning from them = maturity. So I set out to have a lot of unique experiences, and I think I did rather a good job. I've had an interesting, enjoyable life. The only part I regret is wasting my age 13/14/15/16 years in middle school and high school. I had some fun with extracurricular activities and friends, but I could have done something so much more interesting during the actual classtime. Yuck.<p>One in particular that made me wake up when I read it was Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was third of Japan's great unifiers. In the 1600's, he founded the Tokugawa Shogunate - his family ruined in almost complete peace for 250 years after one of the most lawless and brutal times in Japanese history. Ieyasu married for the first time at age 13 or 14, and was Captain of a small division of troops around the 14/15 years. He did a pretty admirable job of it, grew up fast, and the rest is history.<p>But I think the flipside is true, too - if you don't let someone have responsibility, if you treat them like a child, they'll stay childlike and immature. Being an American who has traveled, I see people who are age 26-28 who are barely capable of functioning in the world, and I sometimes see people age 14-18 doing amazing things. This could be the norm, if we wanted it to.<p>I had a 17 year old fellow apply to work for me - he was half-generation American, if I've got the terminology right - he immigrated here with his parents around age 10 or so. I didn't wind up hiring him, but I became a mentor to him. We'd go get tea or coffee every couple weeks and I'd give him some generally no-BS advise. A very good guy, he's done some really impressive things in a short period of time - all he had to do was shake off the reigns and shackles, but  that is harder than it sounds to do. At least in the average American school, they punish you swiftly, thoroughly, and publicly if you try to abstain or dare to question them. There's the occasional good teacher - I had maybe a dozen excellent professional teachers in my life, which I count myself quite lucky to have had. But the rest? Well, I guess we shouldn't be too hard on them. They're just doing what they were taught, too.",1250034671

But I got involved in a bunch of clubs & activities, just hung out and chilled with my housemates a lot at like 4 AM, got to know hundreds of friends through the Internet, studied abroad, learned Lisp and functional programming, took on a major software rewrite for a popular website, went to a few parties (enough so I felt like I didn't miss out anything), had lots of quasi-intellectual discussions with friends, read lots of books, visited local attractions, and took courses at other colleges in the area.  I feel like this is an opportunity cost that I'd regret missing a lot more than the class-time and homework assignments than I skipped.<p>The irony is that it doesn't seem to have harmed my career at all.

  Adding support for more software
  Adding support for more operating systems
  Testing against other hosting providers (this is a cloud!)
  A management console<p>The management console will allow you to save 'recipes', so you can have a custom deploy package.<p>I also have the ability for making the system interactive (ie, a user is prompted for input via the web and their response is relayed to the server).

Kthx.<p>Seriously though, I don't have a problem with people <i>willing</i> to do spec work at all - I see it as a symptom of a systematic problem that is encouraged by people <i>abusing</i> the spec work model.<p>As I've said before, the concept of spec work originally is so that the client can ""try before they buy"" - given that designers have such a high variance, and the product is hardly a commodity. You do a bit of leg work, show off your chops, and the rest of a sizable job is yours.<p>The problem here is when people start soliciting <i>complete work</i> for <i>commercial</i> purposes. This is not a try-before-you-buy, this is just give-me-stuff-for-free.<p>Material benefits (and lack thereof) aside, I think this model reeks of disrespect for the design community (disclosure: I am a coder, not a designer). I've issued these design contests myself in the past, and I no longer do so - and every single time I did, I felt like a jackass, since clearly I was trying to get something for nothing. I was trying to gain ownership for a volume of work that is worth far more than what I paid for it (in cash, ""exposure"", etc). This is not an equitable trade, and I knew it the entire time - and I think a reasonably smart guy like Ferriss knows this too.<p>By the way, since I saw a post somewhere in this thread... I issued the contests because I was too poor to pay for real design work - but that's a justification to myself and myself only, and does nothing to change the fact that I the trade was still not equitable.",1250032342

Believe it or not, what designers are feeling and how they're acting is nothing all that special or unique - it's happened to many different fields over the course of history. When a new, cheaper way of doing things comes around, buyers celebrate, and sellers get really, really upset.<p>Do you know the term ""Luddite"", meaning someone that's technologically backwards? It came from loomweavers who protested and actually broke mechanized looms that made weaving (and thus clothing) much cheaper. Not too long ago, people bought or made a new shirt every year or two. One shirt. You wore it all year, and patched it up if it tore. It was expensive! It all hand-weaved.<p>When mechanized looms came in, it sped weaving up - clothes got a lot cheaper, but less weavers were needed. Many weavers didn't like that. Some actually took to breaking looms.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite</a> -<p>""The Luddites were a social movement of British textile artisans in the early nineteenth century who protested—often by destroying mechanized looms—against the changes produced by the Industrial Revolution, which they felt were leaving them without work and changing their entire way of life.""<p>Horse drivers protested cars once they started catching on too. This is how it goes. It's not a glamorous passing of the torch with dignity or anything like that. Design used to cost a hell of a lot, and now it doesn't necessarily.<p>But I sympathize. It happened to web designers too. The first website I had commissioned cost something like $13,000 and it wasn't all that long ago. (It was late and over budget - but the features were really good for the era. We had <i>a scrolling news bar</i> - I can't even begin to explain how cutting edge that was for the time)<p>Paul Graham sold Viaweb for $45 million. I had something with more power and fuctionality put together only a few years later for $13,000. Now you could get similar quality for $500-$1000 professionally, or hack around with a CMS and do it for a couple hundred bucks yourself.<p>But I imagine a lot of website designers and coders lost their jobs, or changed the way they did business. It was a gravy train for a while - now, not so much. I can imagine that there's a designer somewhere throwing darts at a picture of Matt Mullenweg, saying, ""Curse you and your Wordpress! Curse you! Curse you to hell!""<p>For tangible products, I still pay for design I know is good with someone that can capture emotion very well. But if it's just a project I'm slapping up and come what may, I'll Elance that sucker and get 10 potential, slapped together designs for $50. I'll spend another $20 to $50 to iterate on that and it'll work to start. Actually, forget Elance these days - 99designs.com looks like the future. Fellow Hacker Newser bobz turned me onto the site - it looks pretty amazing for getting a passable design done on a budget.<p>But I do sympathize. Progress is all the consumers of society, but it can be painful for the people who produced the old way. You can look at the legacy airlines or United Auto Workers or farriering (horseshoeing) or swordssmiths or ""workstation"" style superpowered computers, or any number of things. People had to radically change how they did their work, or change their work, or not work.<p>I sympathize. A good designer is worth a hell of a lot, and the proven, world class designers will continue to be paid well for highly leveraged projects.<p>The price pressure for the bottom is here to stay though - people in rural parts of developing countries, high school kids and maybe even middle school kids, people just casually screwing around who don't care about the craft... and, maybe even, some people who work fast and can put out a first iteration in 20-30 minutes, and revise it in another 20-30 minutes, and win a $200 contest 1/4th of the time they enter. That'd be $50/hour in money and they'd have a huge portfolio that they can use to revise on as templates for jobs or sell as stock design afterwards.<p>The old way is gone. The new way will work once we all adjust. But we ought to sympathize with the plight of people who are forced to change through no fault of their own - change is typically hard and unpleasant, and you and I will curse the next time our fields change as well.",1250032332

I think a lot of feeling ""mature"" is actually having responsibility for yourself. If teenagers had responsibility for themselves, and didn't have the artificial environment of high school to pressure them in the wrong direction, I believe nearly all of them could be fully functioning adults.<p>I don't think mature brain connections correlates with mature decision making. People become adults when they're finally faced with adult decisions and have to deal with the consequences.<p>All one needs to make mature decisions is a sense of the consequences of actions and an ability to delay gratification to reach later goals. Both of which is fully within the grasp of teenagers, if they're taught properly growing up.",1250032276

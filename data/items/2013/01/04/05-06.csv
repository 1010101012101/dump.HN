Difficult to comment on astronomy because I not sufficiently familiar with the topic.<p>Maybe my point is more that when people think of biology/medicine/psych they will often put it in a context of people,animals,plants which is more stereotypical ""women stuff"". Whereas physics/chemistry/CS is more often thought of in the context of ""things"" like buildings,bombs,cars,computers etc which is stereotypical ""guy stuff"".<p>Mathematics is difficult to generalise because it has such a wide range of applications.",1357279101

Our grand kids in 50 years will wonder how we did foolishly let (almost) everyone drive so dangerous a killing machine.<p>But I am not ok with most other directions Google seem to be looking at:<p>- Voice control: Voice control maybe useful to do some hand-less complex configuration but it will always be awkward for normal operations of electronic tools. To push the comparison to its limits: one would not talk to one's screwdriver (""on the left, on the left, stop! on the right! get inside, turn right, euh no! I mean LEFT, counterclockwise...""), one will always prefer tools with direct interaction and feedback. Moreover, in most situations, using voice or sound to communicate is just adding noise to already noisy envs (eg on a plane, train, during meetings. etc).<p>A factory robot or a plane cockpit have full-fledged interfaces, with knobs and screens and all, but none will use voice control or even sound feedback except for the most urgent and intrusive warning notifications. Even the navigation voice telling me to ""turn left in 100 meters"" is too intrusive, because maybe at the same time I am talking with someone in the car. A soft ""bzzz"" on the wheel to remind me to check the navigation screen should be enough.<p>As anyone has experienced, the voice robot ""press one for x, press two for y"" is a very good subject for jokes, because it is borderline unbearable: both too slow and too fast, both too rigid and not solid enough. With touchscreens in everyone pocket, I bet these usability nightmares will be replaced with apps or websites.<p>So, in all, voice control, Siri and Google Now seem to be technological dead-ends. It will probably be similar to alchemy however: it is wrong to try to make gold out of mud, but it was the seed of Chemistry.<p>- Guess my wishes: I think the ""Fairy Godmother"" better stay fairy tale. Human beings have shown enough they do not like to be catered like a crowd of sheep. History books are full of revolutions against entities willing to ""guess the wishes"", from the Catholic Church, to communism, to feudalism. Always in the name of Freedom, and freedom is best felt when you have ""unguessable wishes"". If Google buys me plane tickets to Sri Lanka because it has detected it was the most suitable destination for my tastes, I probably will cancel the tickets and turn off Google Travel Prescience, because I want this choice to be mine.<p>I know I am getting a bit too far, but I don't think most people really want their wishes to be guessed. Everyone hopes to be unique, and choose one's life, and decide one's fate. This is the feeling of one's freedom and guessing wishes would just kill it.<p>Or, the ""suggestions"" must be very careful in suggesting things and must be psychological enough to let you think that you did find the idea yourself. Just like a careful mother will transparently suggest to a kid something to do or not to do and at the same time will not hinder the kids' feeling of ""free-will"".",1357277598

5006408,comment,5005690,5006279,1,0,acabal,,,"The way I understand it, a nation's economic standing as a borrower is based basically on trust.  A lender nation trusts that the borrower nation can eventually repay its debt.  That trust isn't so much related to the raw number of the current debt, but rather how the lender believes the borrower will behave and evolve in the coming years.  Today nobody has a reason to believe the US will do anything but continue to grow (in the long run).<p>If in a hypothetical alternate universe the US had a civil war tomorrow, it could have a massive budget <i>surplus</i> and yet it'd probably find that nobody would be willing to lend to it regardless, because the climate of repayment would be so uncertain.<p>In today's real world, the US has the power to print its own money.  In very real terms it can define the very term ""debt"" as whatever it pleases.  That, combined with its status as a massive buyer of foreign goods, history of entrepreneurship and growth, history of corrective action by the Fed, insanely powerful military, and so on, means that it could owe 100x times as much as it does today, and nations would probably still happily lend.<p>A nation is not a household.  It doesn't reach some magic number ""lending ceiling"" where everyone else says, ""you owe 100 trillion and 1 dollars, we're not gonna lend any more"" like might happen to a regular person with a credit card.  A ""AAA"" rating is just some label that some private company makes up.<p>So the issue isn't some dollar amount drawn out of an economist's hat, but rather the real trust inferred from a nation's geopolitical position.<p>Any real students of economics please do correct me, as I have no doubt my reasoning is flawed somewhere.  But this is how I currently understand it.",1357277578

So please, don't read this thinking I'm making specific claims about AR. I'm just responding to one part of the above claim.<p>Anyhow...<p>Parameterized queries do not ""fix the SQL injection problem altogether"". They solve the most common issue where someone is simply building up a full SQL statement and passing user inputs as part of the string (not as parameters). I call that ""Class 1"" SQL injection problem. You find this a lot in hand-rolled web apps (especially PHP apps since the legacy MySQL library hasn't been snipped out yet and most tutorials explicitly tell you to do this, even though PHP has long supported parametric SQL).<p>However, many DB access libraries and ORMs offer facilities that generally revolve around the desire to allow the client application to customize or optimize the generated SQL created by the library (or bypass the SQL generation but leverage the library managed connection state). The API typically just trusts that you know what you are doing, blindly accepts the SQL you give it and injects it into (or replaces) whatever it generated on its own. These are the source of what I call those Class 2 injection vulnerabilities. That is, SQL gets injected in what cannot otherwise be parameterized. These can be mitigated by running a sanity check on the full SQL before it goes to the server (for example, searching it for comment strings and raising and exception or returning an error if they are detected). They can also be detected by scanning your query logs for the same things. Also, this is typically caused by a bug in your code, not the library, since it was trusting you to give it clean SQL.",1357276731

Docket Gold. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/63950-Docket-Letter-Canary-Sheets/dp/B00008ZPKT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/63950-Docket-Letter-Canary-Sheets/dp/B...</a> Heavier paper feels kind of like writing on parchment.

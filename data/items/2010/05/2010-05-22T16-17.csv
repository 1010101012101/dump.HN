Anyone who says differently is selling something.""<p>Enthusiasm, like optimism, is a choice rather something that just happens to you. It requires a lot of forethought (what do I <i>really</i> care about?) and continual maintenance. You need to spend time discovering and remembering the fascinating parts of whatever you're doing, and the end-results you're shooting for.<p>I was stuck in an awful job stocking a supermarket, with no alternatives I could find. I realized I had a choice about how I approached it, I could either mope around all day or find something I liked about it. I discovered my OCD side really appreciated looking down a whole aisle and seeing every can perfectly stacked with the labels aligned. It still makes me smile thinking about it, and left me enthusiastic enough to stick with that job for years, get through college and move onto other goals.",1274547219

It gets me out the door to run (I've never worked out before), it helps me pick up the statistics books I have (course I failed in college) and and it reminds me to do my best at work everyday. It's quickly becoming my mantra and maybe it will help you but you might also find it to be extremely trite so take this for what it is.<p>CONSISTENCY
By George H. Allen (Only NFL coach to never have a losing season)<p>Consistency is the truest measure of performance. Almost anyone can have a great day, or even a good year, but true success is the ability to perform day in and day out, year after year, under all kinds of conditions. Inconsistency will win some of the time; consistency will win most of the time.<p>Consistency requires concentration, determination, and repetition.<p>To be at your best all the time, you must:
Take nothing for granted. If you aren’t “up” every day, some thing, or someone, will knock you down.
Take pride in what you do. The things you do well are the things you enjoy doing.
Take setbacks in stride. Don’t brood over reverses; learn from them.
Take calculated chances. To win something, you must risk something.
Take work home. To get ahead, plan ahead.
Take the extra lap. Condition yourself for the long run. The tested can always take it.
Don’t take “no” for an answer.
You can do what you believe you can do.<p>PS…Celebrate after the victory!",1274547212

""J1"" is what people call these girls and the story goes like this:<p>They come here on work sponsorships which are almost never really there (they often dont know that). Then one of three things happens -- or all. They end up working in the restaurant business as hostesses, bus ""boy"" positions, eventually waitresses. They start sleeping with some guy who takes them around, pays for everything, and possibly provides a place to live. If they want to make real money, they start dancing (strip or go-go). At the end of the summer their Visa expires and I'd say about 70% leave and 30% stay.<p>So... it probably wouldn't have been sex trafficking, this is all way too dramatized. The J1 girls who come here are often offered to dance to make more money. And they either refuse and struggle to find a job in some crappy lounge or restaurant or they go dance and make pretty decent money. I'm not saying that this is a wonderful situation, it makes me hate living in this city, but its so common and a far cry from being locked in a room to be sex slaves.<p>I known some of these girls that are still here and still dance, and know a few that are still here and still work at lounges. Last year, a friend of mine was walking her dog and met two J1 students on the board walk at Brighton Beach sitting on their luggage. They had to make the same trip from somewhere to New York for a job. Of course the job wasn't really there. My friend let the couple stay in her living room for most of the summer and they eventually found a job at a restaurant.<p>Living in Brooklyn, this is a fact of live. Its nice that these particular girls have gotten some help, but starting this week ""the J1s are coming"" and this sort of thing is going to happen a thousand times over in the next couple of weeks to a month. Non of it was surprising to read... which, I guess, is pretty depressing considering that I live in the middle of it.",1274546754

1370570,comment,1367157,1367157,0,0,pbh,,,"I asked a very similar question to this on MetaFilter a few weeks ago.  To summarize, I think you're actually conflating three things: design, graphic design, and graphic design for the web.<p>As far as I can tell as a non-designer, there seem to be (essentially) two phases to graphic design for the web: wireframes and final design.  The first phase is sort of a high volatility phase where one tries out many different approaches, mocking them up with extremely basic wireframes (in something like Balsamiq or even on paper for the best designers), figuring out what the client really wants (they don't know) and figuring out what you want.  The second phase is making something nice looking based on the wireframes and other details from the first phase.<p>These two phases are completely different.  They can, and often are, done by completely different people.  To be good at either, you need to have spent years developing a good sense of design.  However, other than that the skills seem quite different.  For the first phase, one might need layout and communication skills.  For the second, one might need to know about typography and color theory, maybe be able to draw proficiently, and so on.  Often, the second phase includes turning the design into HTML and CSS, but this is rarely a good use of the designer's time, and can be delegated to specialty providers like psd2html.<p>Without more knowledge about what your background is, and why you want to study graphic design for the web, I think it is difficult for anyone to suggest what you need to study first.  However, given how little of the above was really specific to web design, I think you might be better served by a more general design program, which might also be easier to find.",1274545892

You could say I'm trying to form my projects in such a way that the completion of it doesn't completely rely on my own enthusiasm.",1274545632

Price comparisons are relatively safe.""<p>As someone intimately familiar w/3rd party seller feedback on Amazon, I can tell you that the feedback there is taken very seriously by 3rd party sellers, by customers, and by Amazon. If a seller drops below a rating threshold, they are warned, and if the poor ratings persist, they're given the kiss of death: their ""Featured Merchant"" status is revoked.<p>I've never heard any suggestion of these ratings treading ""dangerously close to defamation.""<p>IMO, online feedback / reputations are very successful at rewarding good sellers and punishing bad ones.

E.g. you <i>malloc</i> a byte array and gain a reference to the (byte[] rep.) memory object in heap. The life-cycle of a memory object in heap is explicitly controlled by OS (and sometimes the language e.g. C/Obj-C/etc via <i>freeing</i> the heap memory object).  Languages with garbage collectors do this implicitly.<p>The ""stack"" is the dynamic structure -- its a stack :) -- that maintains the nested call/method/function <i>frames</i> from the initial entry point (e.g. <i>main(..)</i> in C family) so it maintains the path traversing the invocation/call graph to the current executing call/method/function.  The 'objects' in a stack are call/function/method parameters, various metadata (e.g. obj ptr in some oo langauges). The life cycle of objects in stack is scoped by the call/function/method itself.  Further, typically attempts are made to store (current) stack objects in CPU registers so as to avoid incurring memory access latencies.",1325007513

As idiotic as this mentality has always seemed to me, as I get older (and hopefully a bit wiser) I've come to understand there is some merit to it.<p>I travel overseas frequently. One of my favorite airports is Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport. I like it because I can sit in a cafe waiting for my plane to New York, and I can listen to the PA make announcements for flights to Nairobi, Dubai, Singapore, Moscow, Pairs, and Sao Paulo. Istanbul literally connects to the entire world. And yet, there is only one gate in the entire terminal that has ""secondary screening"", the one for the New York flight. The thought that somehow the threat of terrorism is greater in the United States than anywhere else in the world is laughable to anyone who pays the slightest bit of attention to world events. Yet, it is only the United States that feels the need to have extra security precautions.<p>I wonder how many Americans see the TSA, the Patriot Act, etc. as evidence of the greatness of America. ""Our country must be the greatest in the world if it requires so much effort to protect,"" I imagine them thinking. ""Why would so many people be against us if it were not the case?"" In reality, the rest of the world sees a frightened bully, and they're not falling for it any more. They go to places like Istanbul's airport, or any of the hundreds of other airports around the world that have extra screening set up exclusively for US bound flights, and they see weakness.<p>What's really almost funny about all of this, is that the 4th amendment is uniquely American. It is not at all uncommon in other countries for police (or the Gendarme) to be authorized to stop pedestrians and perform a search without cause. The mere existence of the 4th amendment has, traditionally, been a sign of strength. As if to say: ""We're so confident of our security and the resolve of our justice system that we will give our citizens this extra right.""<p>By reducing 4th amendment rights, the US is not gaining security, it is showing weakness...and that can be dangerous to the long term health of a country.",1325006754

This benefits them greatly in heavily populated urban centers.\n5-You can have regenerative breaking and recover some of the lost energy. However small, this is something gas engines cannot do.\n6-Several components are not needed. Electric engines do not have the same lubrication requirements of internal combustion engines. So no oil, no heat sinks and water pumps (except in some implementations, to cool batteries while charging), electric generator (unless hybrid), exhaust pipes, fuel catalysts, spark plugs (and no high-voltage coils), fuel pumps.. the list goes on and on.

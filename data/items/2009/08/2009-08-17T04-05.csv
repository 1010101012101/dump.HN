We can watch which parts of the brain light up when doing morality (eg google brain fairness). Even monkeys have a sense of fairness (google). If birds could talk they'd tell you it's a ""moral fact"" that birds should protect their young. Morality is clearly hardwired through evolution[1].<p>To see how frustrating this is, imagine you're arguing with people who are sure CPUs work because of ""machine spirits.""

767378,comment,766312,766312,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"This is an interesting post but the topic has drifted off the main question and into questions revolving around what you should do with your life.  I won't presume to tell you what to do with your life because I don't know you... but I do have some tips related to keeping sharp.<p>1) Find your ""sweet spot"" of how many hours of sleep you need and make sure you get it. My sweet spot is right around 7hrs. If I go long or short of this for long periods I lose my edge.  Apparently the number of hours required will fall as you age and if you have kids, well unfortunately you will be pulling short hours for a while.<p>2) Start each day with a regular routine. I use the Franklin Planner but the idea is sit down with cup of coffee without interruptions and decide what you want to get done today -- its called dayplanning in the Franklin system. Should only take about 20 minutes. Anything that needs to be done tomorrow or later that week forget about it, let it go and fully concentrate on the tasks for TODAY. (Yes, you need some kind of system to track things not necessarily the Franklin system but I like it and I recommend it.)<p>3) As an adjunct to dayplanning I do the daily crossword in the paper to get my mind going in the morning. You'd be surprised not just how that gets the morning cob webs out but also its a form of measurement of how sharp my mind is. Often I can tell from that if I'm coming down with a cold or subconsciously distracted by something that I need to deal with -- either can undermine sharpness.<p>4) I love coffee but too much is bad (esp in the afternoon) so watch the consumption of drugs... caffeine, alcohol, even  OTC drugs like tylenol, advil, etc.  Alcohol dulls my edge for 2 days if I drink more than a glass of wine or a beer with a meal.<p>5) Write a daily journal or diary. Its good to get all the ideas and emotions floating around in your head down on paper in black and white. You might be surprised at things you discover about yourself and others that you were just peripherally aware of until you write. Look for and correct any contradictions in your ideas and values since implicit contradictions interfere with integration and smooth operation of your mind.<p>6) Get regular exercise but don't over do it.  Consider going low-carb. The brain operates equally well on ketones or glucose but many (including my self) find that low carb diet gives me more focus.  Read Gary Taubes book ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" for the real deal on the science behind low carb and the lack of science behind the modern diet offered by current medicine/nutritionist.<p>7) Make a distinction between a job and a career. A job pays the bills but does not challenge you intellectually. I currently have a job in IT that I like but its not something that fully engages my mind.  Ideally you want a career but not everyone can get that.  A career should be an open-ended field (i.e. lifelong challenges) that is commensurate with your abilities.  If you have a job like me then you need to have other outside activities that challenges your mind. If you don't do this your mind will atrophy.<p>8) Read books and articles outside you main areas of interest and pickup other hobbies that force you out of your comfort zone such as learning a musical instrument or dance, etc.  I meet new people in my job and I always like to ask them what do they do for a living, most people are happy to talk about themselves and I am always amazed at the things I learn from others.<p>9) Sadly, I must warn you that once you hit your late 30's or early 40's you mind just won't be as sharp. So all you youngsters out there do your hard thinking when you are young.<p>10) Make time for family, girlfriend, wife, etc but set clear boundaries so they don't interrupt or interfere with your thinking time. This is hard to do ;-)<p>Edit: Added #10",1250484397

Do post there, though, you'll get some great feedback.<p>Usefultools gave me a tiny little bit of a review, but mostly just regurgitated my copy. They yielded a good bit of traffic, though.<p>My best review thus far was from a random blogger who had reviewed a competitor.  I sent him a personal email saying ""Hi, I'm impressed with your candor and feedback, would you please review my site?  Here's a promotional premium account.""<p>Also, hang around Launchly or HN for a while (I see you just signed up for HN) and give other people feedback.  Both have reputation systems.  You might even have luck giving other people serious feedback and tacking onto the bottom ""if you have a moment to spare, could you give me some feedback on three-year-project.com""<p>However, in terms of long-term recurring members, I can't say any of those paths have yielded much.

767375,comment,766435,766435,0,0,sherrod,,,"This thread is really fascinating, ranging from the hilarious to the intelligent. I agree that touching isn't THAT big of a deal that you need to get all worked up. However, there are legitimate reasons for not touching people's screens. I have a screen with a matte display -- that's without the extremely glossy and reflective glass covering. If someone has even the shortest of short fingernails -- and most people do -- they're going to do some kind of damage to the rather sensitive, uncovered screen. I'm not about to go get a mirror -- other people call them glossy screens -- just to protect my screen from your projectile fingers. If I do touch a screen, which happens because like some person said, you don't always think about it, I make sure to touch with the pad of my finger and not the nail. And pens are a complete nofuckingway no matter what kind of screen it is. They will ruin any screen. You ever try to get ink out of a tiny indentation in a glass screen? Because you can't. It's happened to me.<p>So in conclusion, if your screen isn't glass-covered and they're coming at it like an ICBM, definitely say something polite (Excuse me..., Please don't..., Umm...). But if your screen is protected and they're not using a pen/knife to point...let it go. Most screens are so bright you can't even see smudges.",1250484283

This is not the case with just HN but almost any online forum, be it USENET, slashdot, reddit, etc. The initial and early populations tend to have a lot in common, are significantly self-selecting, etc, etc. This produces 'interesting' content, which in turn fuels growth which fuels further growth and the eventual dilution of the 'community' and the quality of the content.

How would a complete simulation of the brain tell us how a chemical reaction could cause a feeling? That seems quite a lot to hope for!<p>There is also a question-begging element here. What you consider a ""complete"" simulation of the brain will differ depending on whether or not you are a materialist in the first place. (I.e., will the simulation include feelings as part of its model? If it doesn't, aren't you begging the question in favor of physicalism?)<p>>as we haven't yet found any other process which doesn't [obey the laws of physics].<p>Isn't this basically true by definition? If we find something that doesn't obey the laws of current physics, we just modify the laws. We certainly found processes which didn't obey the currently accepted laws of physics at a number of points in the history of physics.",1250482096

I take it as an statement of ""what they think the world needs/wants/would-pay-for right now.""  Having a sense for markets seems a bit like being able to predict the weather based on the way an old injury aches, and young entrepreneurs with a whole lot of energy don't usually have that sense.  As one of them, I have to say it's nice to see suggestions of unsaturated/needy markets.  It's icing that the advice is coming from someone who also can help bring proposed solutions to market.<p>As a side note, I'd really love if someone similarly informed did this with a philanthropic eye.  Think ""things the world could really use right about now,"" since those who feel the pains rarely are the ones with the ability to fix them on a replicable scale.  Like a giant to-do list for humanity, maintained by people with a great degree of perspective.  But I also have a hankering for a philanthropic equivalent of YC that funds and supports non-loss startups.",1250481921

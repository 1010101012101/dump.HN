Also you're forgetting about the assembly cost which is the Chinese advantage.<p>Really I don't think it will change even the prototype industry much, maybe for first runs but for production models I like to select the finish, shine, paint, etc and a 3D printer just can't do that at the same cost. Even comparing turnaround time, I can get a prototype rushed from order to me in 24 hours for less than a $1000.

It would all be so easy, it seems.<p>But the more I play with Apple devices (my wife owns a Mac and an iPhone and we have iPod Touches and a ATV2), the more I realize that I want computers, not computing appliances. And it seems like the future of Apple, even Macs, is in appliances.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think some appliances are great for some applications, and I think most people don't need more than that, and Apple is obviously doing very well and is going to continue to do so, but it's not what I want.<p>And there's another component, too: Apple's control over their devices comes with a weird moral component in the form of quality control. Which is fine for some, I guess. Disneyland is a fun place for lots of people to visit, too, I understand.

Either way whatever damage might be done to Android via the user's own bad choices is done and in any case that's a caveat emptor situation that Google can't and shouldn't try to control.<p>I'm not sure what the actual reasons are behind this but IMO the consequences are all pretty negative.  This move makes Andy Rubin look like a bit of a hypocrite in light of his public twitter-spat with Steve Jobs, it generates ill will for them among the open source community, it mildly kneecaps one of the important things that make a subset of tech-trendsetters favor Android over iOS, etc, and for what purpose exactly?  No good one that is visible from the outside looking in.<p>Ultimately Android is Google's thing and they can take their ball and go home for any reason, but if they are going to do so they should really give a better explaination of why they are doing it because the one they seem to be going with rings hollow.",1301072254

Now I'm 22 years old working full time (40-50 hrs/week) as a web developer at a small consulting company. I make $19,200 per year, which I know is well below the average salary for a developer, even at this early stage in my career. I don't have benefits either (no employer 401k, no health insurance, etc.).<p>I'm also in college part-time, working on a BS in Computer Science. I live on my own, have zero debt, and my bills are low, but after paying tuition, I am unable to save anything.<p>They offered me the job in August 2010 at the end of my 6-month part-time (unpaid) internship with the company (which I got by calling them and asking). I took the job because it was an opportunity to do what I love full-time, and frankly, it was more than I was making previously.<p>But now I really feel stuck making so little money, and my financial goals are unattainable. I like my job for the most part, but I have only partial schooling and little professional experience under my belt. It is certainly a frustrating predicament.<p>TL;DR\nI want to ask for a significant raise when I hit my 12th or 18th month of paid employment here, but I feel like I can't justify it to myself or my employer without having yet completed my degree, and with no higher-paying offers on the table.

(Scottish law is radically different -- based on defamation rather than libel/slander -- and oddly enough, Scotland isn't a libel shopping destination.)<p>2. The English libel law (which is what's up for reform this year) was pushed through in the 18th century as an alternative to the dueling field for blue-bloods with swords to defend their honour. It succeeded admirably in reducing the death rate, but the challenge/defense model implicit in a mediated replacement for dueling between peers doesn't transfer well to a situation where we have corporations using it as a vehicle for SLAPPs.<p>I'd really like to see, as a principle of law, the axiom that corporations do not have a personal reputation that can be impugned-- that reputation only applies to living human beings. As an example of why, consider the McLibel Case: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/McLibel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/McLibel</a>",1301071479

People can sit for about 55 minutes.  Two sessions = 110 minutes. 43 startups presenting means slots are at most 110/43 minutes.<p>The solution will be to move to 3 sessions.  That was inevitable anyway, as the number of startups per cycle increases.

So there are some valuable domains, but the majority are worth $0 in my opinion. <i>(Note: I don't mean to sound insulting when I say they're worthless - indeed, I literally mean it that their valuation is $0)</i>.<p>It's also worth noting that the domain industry got hit a fair bit by the recession, and it's possible that some of the above domains would sell for slightly higher than the rough range I've given (espeically the two 4 figure domains I quote, which could go for low 5 figures in the right circumstances).<p>It's quite common to see people (as the blog post says) regging domains on a whim since they look good, but usually such domains regged on a whim are worthless. And unfortunately it does seem to be the case here.<p>Anywhoo, I'll send my semi-informed appraisals along to the blog author now. I've been a domainer since I was 16/17 (am 20; 21 next month), so whilst I'm not an expert or anything, I have a fair bit of domaining experience and hope my appraisals are somewhat useful.<p>And I'd possibly advise that he looks at DNForum.com and NamePros.com (the two big domaining forums; the former is paid-only though) a little bit to get a general feel of domain prices.",1301068995

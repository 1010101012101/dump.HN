Do we really think Apple can make a far better map solution in basically three months?<p>http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ios-6-maps-screwup-2012-6<p>www.gizmodo.com/5918176/google-maps-vs-apple-maps-a-side-by-side-comparison<p>The Maps are bad.<p>Really bad.<p>Beta isn't used to LABEL OCEANS.<p>Is the app randomly crashing? Yes, lets fix that.<p>But a map that shows 1/2 of a massive body of water like a local bay? Just unacceptable.<p>Who tested this thing?<p>Google has had 10 years to get this right and Apple knows that they should have something CLOSE to that before they really try to supplement their own option. Having turn-by-turn means nothing if the maps lack readability or clarity.<p>This makes me also think...has Apple really ever given the sort of care and attention to something that maps require?<p>Google has shown the work what it takes to make premier mapping services and has gone through great lengths to preserve that sort of leverage. I also think having a desktop browser version helps since it offers a vast array of customizations and configurations.<p>Consider even the search logic used. Google's resources and ability to interpret even vague queries really makes you appreciate their map product even more.<p>Maps are a CORE part of smart phone experiences. Apple better not give us more FlyOver demos and thinks that this cuts it.<p>I really think they're making a graven error here.<p>I'm an iPhone user but I would greatly consider paying for a Google turn-by-turn option if they made one.",1339642797

Age plays into this, and if the 50+ founder doesn't have a strong history in compsci/startups/whatever, the assumptions generally attached to 50+-year-old sales people will stick. As such, the founder will need to recognize that he needs to establish credibility with the audience before he can successfully sell them on his ultra-hip location-aware social tweeter app. Generalizations and stereotypes are a reality that founders must shape to their advantage.",1339642690

It's important to work on things that are inspiring.  In my experience and in the experience of many I have worked with inspiration can overcome all sorts of obstacles.<p>But on planning, I am a huge fan of planning.  I think one should plan extensively and in detail but then shelve the plan and not even look at it during execution.  The real danger with plans is that they are inflexible and cannot take into account unforeseen developments.  However, the time spent thinking through the plan places one in a position to do so.

In fact, I work with some of them, and I respect them greatly.<p>I don't have any hard data, but I can say, anecdotally, most 50+ are not ""techies"" and they don't know their way around a computer system. I believe this belief is rather common.<p>I think some 50+ year olds would make exceptional startup founders. However, an older person who may be founding a ""social, local, mobile"" startup because he's looking for a career change is going to have a credibility gap because of the general impression that older people are not technically minded. If the pitcher doesn't have a strong compsci background or history to counteract that notion, he'll have to make up for it in the presentation.<p>We are all free to pontificate on whether this is a fair generalization or not, but I think it is clearly that it is commonly held and something an older founder will have to face and address if he wants to succeed.",1339642416

Tribes is an interesting example of a ""hack"" that completely re-invents the game (in most people's opinions, for the better).<p>For those not familiar, a bit of gaming history:\nTribes is a FPS where the players have jetpacks and can fly around in the air. The jetpacks have limited energy, so players ended up having to spend a lot of time on the ground too. One particularly innovative aspects of Tribes was it's expansive maps.  It was like a Battlefield game, but 5 years earlier. By only running and jetting, it could take minutes to get across a map, which is important considering the primary objective of the game was to move the opposing team's flag from side of the map to your team's side.<p>The hack was: players discovered that jumping at the instant the player lands on downhill surface caused them to accelerate in the downhill direction.  Mashing repeatedly on the jump key going down a large hill would cause the player to accelerate all the way down the hill, as if there was no friction with the ground (hence ""skiing"").  Someone wrote a script that automated this act so all a player had to do was hold down the jump button instead of pressing it repeatedly.<p>This bug completely re-invented the game into something no one imagined it would be. Many players embraced it, I am sure some did not. It added a layer of complexity and made the game addictively fast paced (with skill you could now get across a map in seconds).  The competitive community embraced the new style of play and the developers had no choice but to not patch the bug.  This bug arguably became the defining gameplay aspect of Tribes.<p>The lesson? As mentioned here many times, the users are what make your product special. Sometimes they will invent uses for it you never imagined :)",1339639930

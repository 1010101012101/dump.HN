3279845,comment,3279612,3279612,2,0,eerpini,,,"Well my friend, here are a few things you should know:
1. If you are interested in research, you should approach professors/find out what they are doing etc, even at the worst of schools, there is always someone doing something worthwhile.
2. As it looks like you are already following hacker news, keeping up to the posts on the front page itself should give you a lot of ideas and things to tinker around with.
3. Believe me, undergrad education is useless, everyone does it to get a degree. What really matters is the environment around. The people around you will help you learn more at school than the course itself does.
4. Ask yourself these simple questions, if the answer is a ""no"", try working towards making it a ""yes"" : 
              Do you have a GITHUB Account ?
              Have you tried getting your hands dirty with any OSS project ? (not necessarily code, configuration ? testing ?)
              Do you follow journals in your area of Interest ? 
              Which courses do you love at school ? Have you supplemented the course with some extra reading ?<p>These are just a few questions that can get you started, for example, the course for algorithms/data structures at most schools in india sucks big time, why not follow it up with a reading of AOCP or the MIT algorithms book. 
And yes as someone already mentioned, concentrating on work rather than cribbing about the system will take you better places.
BTW, I did my undergrad from a so called ""reputed private university"" in India too.",1322319057

""Don't waste hours, days or weeks researching server-side JavaScript, cloud providers and NoSQL, and then compiling, configuring and deploying the systems from scratch. Get a preconfigured virtual server with a running sample application powered by Express.JS.""<p>Primarily the first sentence was a huge turn-off for me.  Researching your technology and understanding it is never a waste of time.  And Server-Side JavaScript is not some magic bullet where you need to know nothing but can write amazing applications.  It is a tricky environment with some great power and massive 'gotchas'.<p>Personally I think you should either remove reference to research or fully embrace the word.  A sales point could be more along the lines of: ""Popular server-side JavaScript frameworks already connected and configured to allow you to jump directly into a working example.  Great for bootstrapping your research project or spinning up servers for your already written application!""  But, I have no silver-tongue so take my wording advice with caution. ;)",1322316722

The power supply is about 25W, but judging by the heat coming off the frame I doubt it uses half that. The main power draw is probably the screen. I removed the hard drive and replaced it with a CF card (basically no power draw), and the fans have been replaced with a large heat sink.<p>For my photo frame, I used cron and set various times for it to turn off the screen.<p>Obviously it's a luxury in terms of power usage, but given that it pulls about as much power as a bright energy saving lightbulb, it's not really a huge issue. In terms of cost, 25W continuous costs about 6c a day, so I'd imagine the whole frame costs less than half that once you take into account the screen-off time and the reduced power draw anyway.",1322316686

Antiviral medicines that treat cases of the flu tend to be in short supply in every flu season, but some governments have taken care to stockpile those in ways that ensure that essential services would go on in those countries even during a severe flu pandemic. Further research on broad-spectrum flu vaccines, including a possible universal vaccine, is warranted to prevent natural strains of the flu and is ongoing. Further research, development, and production of antiviral medicines to treat people who catch the flu is also warranted and ongoing.<p>A new pandemic, from whatever source, would be extremely disruptive, but as an astute previous comment pointed out, people can do things like self-quarantine, and such simple forms of self-protection were very effective in stopping the SARS epidemic in 2003.

It stopped being so due to bad management at three companies and bad government at the national level (Wagner Act, CAFE).  It was (and maybe still is) a good place to design them, but that requires good management (e.g. look at Toyota's sharp (for them) decline in quality, mostly due to design errors).<p>California has worse government, which has killed the manufacturing part of Silicon Valley (e.g. are there <i>any</i> production fab lines still operating there?), but I'm not sure its government can kill off the design part of things.  To do that it would have to make a middle class existence impossible.

I wonder why it's not possible to introduce a new type of object reference that exempts referenced objects from being garbage collected.<p>Then multiple Python interpreters could be started in separate threads, each with its own unmodified GIL, and the only thing they could access would be their own thread local data and those special shared objects.<p>What this amounts to is basically an implementation of a multi process architecture on top of a multi threaded architecture. The crucial difference is that the memory shared among the interpreters could hold pointers and thus proper in memory data structures and not just a BLOB into which everything has to be serialized as in the case of conventional shared memory.<p>Of course the shared objects would have to be manually deleted.<p>One issue I see is that when such a special object is created, all the objects it creates recursively would also have to be allocated in that pool of special objects. But I think it should be possible to use some kind of global flag to special case the allocator.<p>Well, there is probably a huge number of issues with this kind of trickery and it's definately not a long term solution. But I'd love to use Python much more than I do and the GIL issue is what prevents that for me at the moment.",1263767707

1059021,comment,1057991,1058486,0,0,DaniFong,,,"If I understood Lubos correctly, the observational data says that increased temperature is correlated with increased outgoing radiation. This is not at all inconsistent with the greenhouse effect: for example if you had an actual greenhouse and you ran a space heater you'd find more radiation leaking out than if you hadn't heated it. This is because the greenhouse is not entirely opaque to infrared: it still diffuses out, like light through frosted glass, or like light from the center of the sun to its surface. The Earth's greenhouse is not complete. Of course, to make this demonstration I had to use a device: the space heater, whereas in real life the Sun's radiation is measured as relatively constant, as compared to the degree of the heating.<p>The wildcard is in the heat capacity of the varying components of the earth, and convective heat transfer between them. While the greenhouse effect is likely to work in the steady state (e.g. as confirmed by much of planetary science) over the short term temperature increases may be driven more by openings in cloud cover than the residual planetary greenhouse effect. Cloud cover, being a function of water vapor, also a greenhouse gas, will increase reflection and cut heating to the surface, while simultaneously reducing infrared outgoing radiation. However, since CO2 doesn't form clouds, it will have the primary effect of cutting outgoing radiation.",1263765972

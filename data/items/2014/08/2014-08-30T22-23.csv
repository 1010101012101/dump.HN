My guess is that those people will be doctors, even if directly caring for patients isn&#x27;t how they make their money. From what I&#x27;ve gathered by reading about this over the years:<p>* More than half of doctors are self employed, meaning that their salaries don&#x27;t tell the whole story about their incomes.<p>* Doctors are heavily invested as stockholders in provider businesses (insurance, HMO&#x27;s, etc.), and the malpractice insurance industry. Until recently, my employer-provided health care was delivered by a large organization that was entirely doctor-owned.<p>Sorry, no links or evidence for either of these, and I think the gathering of that evidence may be difficult due to the complex financial relationships involved. But it makes me skeptical when I read about doctors struggling against &quot;the system.&quot; Who owns the system? It may very well be that medical care costs less overseas simply due to a simpler system where costs can actually be tracked. Medicine might become a better profession in the US if med school were free, doctors worked for a salary, and everything else was owned by the government.<p>To be fair, it may be doctors exploiting doctors, and your career prospects upon finishing medical school may have a lot to do with how much investment money (e.g., inheritance) you have at your disposal to buy into the portion of the business that ultimately profits.",1409438532

Enough that I think I have a handle on the question.<p>The Emacs APIs for window management, buffers, and other various &quot;chrome&quot; so to speak are pretty good and easy enough to grasp, once you get over the Lisp hump. But the Emacs APIs for managing text in buffers is difficult to wrap one&#x27;s brain around, because it takes a very different approach to text management than most Unix tools. Basically, you write out the editor commands necessary to do the manipulation you desire. That sounds straightforward enough, but it takes some getting used to.<p>What Emacs really excels at, though, and what makes it stand out from other customizable editors is the fact that you can literally change the beast from the inside. Since Emacs is basically a Lisp environment, with some large portion of the code written in Lisp, it&#x27;s very easy to pop functionality in and out to test it out, or to make changes on the fly. In a Lisp buffer, you can just hit Ctrl-J to evaluate the expression immediately preceding the cursor and print the result into the buffer (or use Ctrl-X Ctrl-E to run it without printing the result). Or hit Meta-: from anywhere to run some Lisp interactively from the minibuffer, affecting your environment in real time. This ability to toy around with the running editor itself is a feature unmatched by pretty much any plugin editor. The built-in devtools with Javascript console in Chrome are a close analog in a web browser, but that is limited to the document you are viewing, and you can&#x27;t control the entire browser experience from that console. With Emacs, you can.<p>So yes, I&#x27;d love to see Emacs add modes that move beyond text editing and allow rich buffers and embeddable videos, audio, and widgets of all sorts. There exists a very rudimentary capability for this sort of thing in Emacs now, but it is extremely limited.",1409437895

Others appear to have been abandoned.<p>The differences:<p>NASM: Is written in C and generates object files. Requires a linker to produce executables. Slow, inefficient compilation. Has some syntax quirks. May be more flexible in some cases due to the multiple object formats available.<p>FASM: Written in FASM. Very fast compilation. Cleaner syntax, better debugging tools. Produces executables directly without a linker. Possibly limited due to smaller number of output formats, but likely good enough for most projects that would be written in pure asm anyway.<p>FASM looks like the best option to learn first and then move to NASM for any specific requirement that FASM cannot meet.

Person you would call sniper actually does much more running, crawling, waiting and hiding than shooting.

Some already had fixes submitted months ago but got stuck on different stages of their process of accepting patches. One is not even reported yet (although I admit this one is not about directives but $ q).<p>As for composability they did not seriously thought this through. One bug I found out, the one that got fixed, showed up for anone who created two directives with isolated scope and transclusion, one used in template of the other. Basically isolated scope of outer directive got transcluded into inner one instead scope outer in relation to outside directive.<p>Scopes suffer from the same flaws that with() statement in js suffers mainly that when you assign inside it will be assigned not where you at first expect (current leaf scope not the scope of closest controller). When you add to this the fact that humble ng-model assigns you have a huge hole that nearly all newbies fall into at least once.<p>Another gripe is that angular doesn&#x27;t eat it&#x27;s own dogfood. For example ng-required is not a directive. It&#x27;s just attribute parsed internally by input directive.<p>AngularUI router is worthless if you need to have multiple tabs inside your web app as it allows you to have just one branch of views tree shown at any given time. There are suggestions about implementing parallel subviews but last time I checked it was too hard for them.<p>Angular is set of legos with lots of weird pieces. React is blueprint how to make your own bricks so they fit together and won&#x27;t turn into tower of ugly chaos when assembled.<p>I was distrustful towards virtual dom at first. But that&#x27;s just a way of batching and saving dom changes. The architecture that&#x27;s enabled by it is all about composability and maintaining control over your project.",1409436317

Which is about enough space for about 20 NTSC channels and the FM band. I can assure you that there&#x27;s basically no HFC/CATV provider in the world, never mind the US, with 600 MHz unused just sitting there.",1409436215

It really doesn&#x27;t make much sense to have a highly trained cardiac surgeon spend half an hour stitching up a patient after a surgery.<p>Our National Health Service benefits from substantial levels of integration, allowing for Fordist division of labour. The per-capita budget is much lower than in the US, but we can use that budget very efficiently.<p>Another example is the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which develops evidence-based care pathways and makes key decisions on drug prescribing and purchasing. Because our drug buying is done centrally (giving the NHS considerable negotiating power), and because NICE are prepared to reject a drug on the basis of an inadequate cost-benefit ratio, we pay far less than most industrialised nations for medicines. It is my understanding that competition legislation would prevent insurers and HMOs from implementing such a system in the US.",1409436159

Or, here's another one: this industry has long been dominated by giants: IBM, Microsoft, Google, and so on.  Will we see the end of that?<p>(And just to be clear, I think what pg has done is fantastic, and he/them are quite praiseworthy, etc... I'm just pushing back a bit on the idea.

This is a net win for everyone in that failure happens faster, thus allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently -- it also allows high performing individuals and teams to be accurately compensated for their success, vs. the strict seniority or internal-politics systems in larger organizations.<p>There's an argument for internal communications costs vs. external communications costs (Coase's thing) -- if it's more efficient to communicate within a trusted firm vs. between firms, you end up with huge firms.  Things like tight-knit social networks outside of the firm (college alumni, things like YC, sites like hn, various ethnic diaspora in history, ...) would create some kind of hybrid, too, where a lot of interconnected small firms would work, so each firm could be smaller than otherwise.

The lack thereof legitimizes social norms of sharing.<p>DRM is a tangible embodiment of the the tragedy of the commons. DRM is analogous to a series of electric fences partitioning off the commons so that only some cows from some individuals can graze in certain places, but no other cows can graze there. People will invent electric fences for use in chipping away at the commons, but it would be a disaster for society to standardize the electric fences so that anyone can chip away at the commons effortlessly.<p>I'm of the opinion that if some entity wants to cripple their content with DRM, that is their prerogative, but they shouldn't get help from W3C and other bodies creating open standards.<p>On top of all that, as a developer, DRM is one more layer of bullish*t to deal with. I'm perfectly happy paying for APIs based on usage. I connect, you measure, you charge. Last thing I want to encounter are APIs which require me to implement a cumbersome layer of DRM to use content.<p>Lastly, I can only see the presence of DRM reducing accessibility of content for special needs users, such as the blind, because any form of DRM is likely to reduce how you can manipulate content. What if the DRM prevents close-captioning? text-to-speech? Addition of semantic data? etc.<p>DRM is wrong. It doesn't not produce a better environment for the consumer because it reduces competition.<p>DRM introduces friction. Friction reduces ""liquidity"". Lower liquidity results in a smaller market with fewer options.<p>REST vs SOAP is a perfect example of unnecessary friction in a ""technological market"".

When they are confident that their pipeline is running as expected they run the experiment, put the data through their pipeline and publish the result, no matter how unexpected it is.<p>As the OPERA result showed, it has the problem that if you don't understand everything in your experiment perfectly (which is difficult to do in a very large, complicated experiment) you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by making some obvious-in-retrospect mistake and publishing an obviously absurd result.

Wait, wrong guy...<p>In all seriousness though, while the technology factors certainly enable some 'shrinkage' of the firm, human factors change less, which to me indicates that YC like agglomerations will not replace the corporation in many circumstances.  In other words, it's easier to find people these days, but as contractors, are they really still going to slog it out for a company day in and day out for years?  Most people out there are not like YC founders, would be my bet, and are reasonably happy with their 9/5 jobs, and with not having to hustle to find the next gig.  On the positive side, these people will also retain the tacit knowledge inherent in many human activities, and provide a sense of continuity that a shifting network might have trouble fostering outside a small core.  Apple, for instance, has 60,000+ employees, according to the web page - that's not what I'd consider a small core + network, even though they certainly outsource a lot.  So... trend, yes, but fairly slow once the low-hanging fruit that tech can provide has been integrated.<p>The other big question I have in this vein is whether it will remain so cheap to create a company, or if it's an anomaly, and in the future more capital will be required for anything serious.  My guess is that the long term <i>is</i> towards cheaper, but who knows what may happen.<p>BTW, Wikipedia says it's just an article, and here's the summary for those interested:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm</a>",1329946623

As a developer this isn't a problem so far, I still play games every day.<p>What about social isolation, and losing friends and family until you're alone? I've always been a bit of a curmudgeon, so this is one I need to watch out for. I have to make sure to maintain a healthy group of friends as I get older. So far, so good. It helps that I have a lot of younger siblings, and it's unlikely they'll all die before me.<p>How about getting out of touch with modern society, arts and music? I don't like Lady Gaga or Nicki Minaj, but there's still new bands and new albums coming out that I do enjoy, and I stay aware of even the things I don't like and can understand why other people do.

I keep abreast of new technology and am ready to move to new platforms, languages, etc. when something better comes along.

Elements of a corporation should be almost completely independent and the only reason they are part of one entity is because of synergies and cooperation.<p>To give a toy example, McDonalds might grow and slaughter their own cows because they can better place them near their distribution facilities. Buying from a third party might create unnecessary overhead.<p>I'm sorta oversimplifying things, but I'd recommend reading<p>""Re-Creating the Corporation"" by the late Russell Ackoff to appreciate why corporations exist (and why sometimes they shouldn't)<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Re-Creating-Corporation-Design-Organizations-Century/dp/0195123875/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1329944656&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Re-Creating-Corporation-Design-Organiz...</a>",1329944789

[1]<p>In a nutshell, we know that science more or less progresses from one theory to another after the existing theory has been falsified (Popper), <i>but</i> this transition does not happen overnight, even after a falsifying result has been put forth. That is because science is really structured with a ""hard core"" hypothesis (say, in physics, that nothing moves faster than c), and various ""auxiliary hypotheses"" that <i>bear the brunt of criticism</i> before the core belief is attacked (say those that posit the integrity of the measurement instrument, for example). And that is all that is going on here. There are many, many theories that are going to be dismantled before physics transitions to something post-relativity. It's just the way the assumptions are structured.<p>While this may seem trivial, we see this playing out in the battle of classical against behavioral economics. Are the results of experimental psychology admissible in the criticism of certain economic models? Models don't claim to be perfect, after all...<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos#Research_programmes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos#Research_programme...</a>",1329944469

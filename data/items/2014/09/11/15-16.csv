You also need to consider the differences within LIDAR systems. The velodyne system is for 360 degree field of view. Other automotive LIDAR systems (See continental, Valeo, Ibeo, etc) with lower FOV and functionality (forward collision warning, blindspot detection,etc) are much lower cost > 10x ....",1410451188

For health care products, the calculation of value is inherently inaccurate because an individual places a much higher value on his/her own life than the market would.<p>I do agree that this is an example of misguided government regulation. The problem is that the government tried to use a capitalist solution to a societal value problem (i.e. the orphan drug laws). This created additional arbitrage opportunities. What I&#x27;m saying is that we need a serious discussion at a national level about the goals of our health care system, and the optimal means for achieving those goals.<p>We don&#x27;t need new government regulation of health care; we need an entirely new systemic approach to health care.

8303216,comment,8300432,8301673,2,0,ssmoot,,,"tl;dr: The only competition (IMO) is the LG G3, and IOS makes the difference (IMO).<p>I&#x27;ve owned a Nexus One, Samsung Galaxy S2, Moto X and LG G2.<p>Only the G2&#x27;s camera was decent, but it seems a fairly broad opinion that the iPhone 5&#x27;s camera is the better of the two.<p>Aside from the original iPhone&#x27;s lack of video recording, I&#x27;ve found iPhone cameras to consistently be best of breed.<p>As far as MicroSD: I rarely felt a pinch at 64GB. With higher resolution video (and bigger apps/games over time) I think 128GB will probably serve pretty well.<p>It used to be that the MicroSD expansion on Androids was pretty limited. I&#x27;ve been told that&#x27;s changed, but I wouldn&#x27;t know since my last Android didn&#x27;t have it.<p>As far as battery goes: I much prefer an all-day battery over swapping. I found the iPhone 5&#x27;s battery to last quite a bit longer than the Moto X or G2 with similar usage patterns. It&#x27;s also smaller and much quicker to charge. Sort of like trickle-charging a Tesla vs a Leaf I guess. Bigger isn&#x27;t necessarily always better. If your battery is twice the size, but your phone consumes twice the power under active use, then all things being equal you&#x27;re going to double your charge time.<p>All things aren&#x27;t equal though as the 12w charger will take an iPhone from empty to 80% in what... 30 minutes? The G2 might recover 30% of it&#x27;s charge in that time if I&#x27;m lucky.<p>And no swappable battery.<p>So what does have a swappable battery, a really good camera, has 128GB of storage (or can be expanded to it), and runs Android? That&#x27;s a very short list I think.<p>The Moto X had a terrible camera at launch. After patching it was much improved, but still feel far short of the iPhone. The X+1 only has 32GB of storage (that I can figure out) and no MicroSD.<p>No Nexus device qualifies. Terrible cameras, no SD, no battery replacement.<p>Off the top of my head that leaves the G3, HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5 (might as well throw in the Note 3/4 as well?).<p>Personal tastes and all, and I&#x27;m definitely in the vast majority of opinion on this, but I think the HTC is one of the uglier phones I&#x27;ve seen. Just don&#x27;t care for it at all.<p>The S5&#x27;s shots in the camera reviews I could find seem pretty consistently over saturated and blow out detail, especially in faces. It&#x27;s admittedly one of the best Android cameras I&#x27;ve seen. The 5S camera OTOH does seem less exposed in shaded shots. Maybe it&#x27;s just personal preference, but I feel like I&#x27;d rather preserve the detail and let Google Plus Photos Automagic Enhancement, or iPhoto Enhancement make a photo more punchy if necessary, than losing detail.<p>Plus I don&#x27;t take my kids to a lot of bars. So it&#x27;s important that under sunlight at the zoo the shots aren&#x27;t blown out. Under normal interior lighting conditions the iPhone seems to take the best pictures of people by far from the reviews I could find.<p>The G3 comes closest to meeting the requirements and earning the bonus of &quot;best out-of-box experience/least crapware&quot;. Maybe that&#x27;s moving the goal-post a bit, but it&#x27;s still important to me in the same way it&#x27;s important to Nexus users. The Samsung... meh.<p>My biggest frustration with the G2 was slow charging and that <i>STUPID F</i>CKING MENU BUTTON*. I think the G3 is a definite improvement on both counts.<p>That&#x27;s my trouble with Android phones I guess. Lots of them have compelling features. But very few offer the whole package. It&#x27;s not so much Android vs iPhone at this point. It&#x27;s an LG G3 vs iPhone 6.<p>In that case, I think an iPhone 6 Plus with IOS8 wins on everything but price (it&#x27;s easily $300+ more expensive). For me. Simpler interface. Similar storage. Faster. Longer battery life. Quicker charging.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the G3 seems like a great value, and a legit alternative IMO. But I think the iPhone is the better package overall. I definitely prefer IOS&#x27;s navigation over the app-drawer/menu in Android, I can count on 1 hand the number of times I found Google Now relevant or compelling over just using a Weather widget (I use Yelp, not Google, Passbook is better for Airlines IMO, but Google Now had the occasional suggestion for parks/museums for the kids on the weekend, which was a nice surprise a few times).<p>This is just me. I&#x27;m a flip-flopper. ;-) But I figure others like myself might find talkin&#x27; it out useful. Or at least consider the LG G3. Which seems like the most Nexus-like device with the most complete package that I&#x27;ve seen on the Android side of the fence.<p>I also like the Day-1 software updates for iPhones though. They age much better IMO, and they&#x27;re supported much better. If you&#x27;re an off-contract user like myself, it might also be nice to know that the $300 price differential probably goes away when it&#x27;s time to trade it in. I just sold a G2 for $160 last night. That&#x27;s a 12 month old phone. I can sell my temporary backup iPhone 4S for the same price. A phone three times it&#x27;s age! Crazy.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Leaf, and now Mazda 3. The iPhone Bluetooth or USB always works flawlessly with them. I&#x27;m lucky to get any Android phone I&#x27;ve used to connect 50% of the time. It feels like I have to reboot the phone more often than not.<p>Apparently this isn&#x27;t a problem for some people. But across different vehicles and different Androids I&#x27;ve found Bluetooth connections to be very flaky. So much that I don&#x27;t bother half the time unless I know I want to make a call on the drive home when I get in the car. Once a connection is established I&#x27;ve never had it disconnect that I can recall. It&#x27;s just that it won&#x27;t make the initial connection without a reboot. Turning on/off Bluetooth or Airplane mode seems to have no effect. This is with a Moto X and LG G2.<p>Oh, but one thing I mentioned previously: iMessage. It&#x27;s hard to overstate how superior an experience it is forwarding the video you just recorded to another iPhone user. Hangouts is clunkier than iMessage and while I have a couple Android users in my family, getting them to figure out Hangouts so I can initiate a conversation with the right protocol so I can actually forward a video is something I haven&#x27;t been successful at yet. So I have to upload to Youtube instead and forward them a link. Which takes a minute or two instead of a few seconds.

I could be called an Apple Fanboy, and I myself stopped using iPhones in favor of an Android phone (I really wanted a Windows phone, but my carrier didn&#x27;t have any available when I upgraded).<p>After a little bit of self-analysis, I realized that from iOS&#x27; gigantic app ecosystem, most of the stuff I was buying and installing was throwaway stuff. Most of my activities revolve around the core apps of the phone - e-mail, calendar, browser. My main non-core apps are basically RSS and Read Later apps.<p>Given that most of my stuff is in the cloud (but not the iCloud), it really doesn&#x27;t matter what OS I have on my phone. And I&#x27;m not very interested in buying the latest and greatest when nothing I do really needs the horsepower. So I basically bought the cheapest phone that could do what I need it to (1st gen moto G). I don&#x27;t worry about it getting stolen or broken, because my investment is so small.<p>In the end, the thing that really drove me away from iOS was how each software upgrade gradually crippled the usability of the device. I didn&#x27;t mind paying the Apple premium for my 3G and 4, but that was because Android and WP didn&#x27;t have parity (my opinion, not necessarily fact).

In true free market capitalism, this would never happen because if the original company could make a profit at $1.50, then the new company&#x27;s $30 price would be immediately undercut by other companies who see that they can make a profit at, say, $20, and the price will naturally fall back to something around the costs of production.

The main Marxist-influenced things that have been influenced are:<p>1) Systems deriving, through Leninism, from the both Marxism and what&#x27;s often called &quot;Russian Marxism&quot; (which, while influenced by actual Marxism, didn&#x27;t so much follow it as arise roughly contemporaneously and interact with Marxism), which reject Marx&#x27;s preconditions in favor of vanguardism and are implemented in societies which don&#x27;t meet Marx&#x27;s preconditions -- that is, Soviet Communism and its Maoist, etc., descendants<p>2) Systems which build from Marx&#x27;s preconditions in societies which meet them, and apply large portions of the program Marx and Engels lay out in the Communist Manifesto (but omit other key portions of it), which -- because they are implemented in democratic societies where there is no absolute conformity among the decision-making parties -- are full of compromises, lack a strong coherent ideological commitment either in terms of goals or mechanisms (even if <i>part</i> of the society is explicitly Marxist), and which retain the broad outline of the capitalism (though the resulting system is very different from the thing 19th Century socialists branded &quot;capitalism&quot; because of the elements of socialism, including elements specifically drawn from Marxism, implemented) -- that is, the mixed economies of the modern West.<p>Neither of these is purely Marxist. The former pays more lip service to Marxism. The latter likes to call the former &quot;Marxism&quot; and distinguish itself as the opposition to Marxism, but actually more closely follows Marx&#x27;s model than the former.<p>> Marx believed in class struggle and had a favored side in that struggle. That&#x27;s quite enough.<p>That&#x27;s a rather cartoonish description which has no utility beyond &quot;rah! rah!&quot; cheerleading for the not-Marxist team in a dualistic worldview that, like the more extreme interpretations of Marxism (as seen in &quot;Marxist criticism&quot;, and very much akin to extreme &quot;feminist criticism&quot;) sees all the world divided between two warring camps but, instead of social class, views them as polar Marxist and not-Marxist ideologies.",1410449430

It&#x27;s a necessary evil of capitalism, and unfortunately, our government has decided that free market capitalism is an appropriate system to use for health care.<p>Arbitrage can be explained as thus: you have an opportunity to buy $1 for $0.75. How many dollars do you buy? The correct answer is &quot;all of them&quot;. In this case, a drug had a sale price of $3 and a market value of $150 per pill (established by its competitor), so an investor basically purchased &quot;all of them&quot; and resold them at a higher price.<p>If your goal is maximum economic efficiency, arbitrage is necessary. It allows companies to make decisions with the goal of maximizing profit (i.e. maximum economic efficiency) in moral hazard situations: if something is legal but morally dubious, if they don&#x27;t do it, someone else will force them to. This is necessary because every individual has a slightly different idea of what is &quot;right&quot; and what is &quot;wrong&quot;.  Businesses don&#x27;t have morals because they&#x27;re not people. They are amoral, and arbitrage is the means by which that amorality is maintained. If a person wishes to exercise their moral calculus, they are free to do so when making investment decisions.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that to be the case with healthcare. In my opinion, healthcare is a sector that really shouldn&#x27;t operate along capitalist principles because the goal of a national healthcare system should not be to maximize economic efficiency: it should be to maximize the health and well-being of its citizens. I know that&#x27;s hard to quantify, but it&#x27;s certainly not quantified by the dollars spent on health care. IMO government price controls on healthcare are the only solution to the problem.

Not because it&#x27;s a premature optimization, but because indexes make the queries execute faster. When a software architect creates a schema he doesn&#x27;t know what the queries will look like.</i><p>In my opinion, a critical part of creating a schema is designing it to work well with the expected access patterns. If a software architect is just dictating a rough schema without thinking about the queries that will be issued and the expected nature of the data in the database, the architecture simply isn&#x27;t complete. I&#x27;m all for iterative design and whatnot, but that means that the architect needs to stick around and help out throughout the system&#x27;s lifecycle.<p>Sounds like the original author is working with some pretty checked-out architects.",1410447647

Why do the two (almost) not mix, even after centuries?<p>During my student year in the US, I was friends with students of all colors - culturally they were really the same. So what is it? Peer pressure?<p>Most young black women I see (over here) are incredibly beautiful, but then in my country they&#x27;re mostly fresh immigrants - the cultural difference would be much stronger than a couple of White and Black Americans.<p>From watching TV my impressions are that there&#x27;s especially a taboo for white guys to date black women, and the prejudice that &quot;vanilla&quot; just isn&#x27;t cool. Can anyone enlighten me?",1410447632

4215866,comment,4213217,4214979,4,0,paulsutter,,,"Data scientists have big opportunities in tech startups. Data scientists create that magic spark to give a fragile startup a strong competitive advantage, and share in the upside. Many many startups are trying to learn how to build a data science team.<p>Trevor Hastie at Stanford told me that Google revolutionized the outlook for stats PhDs. Prior to Google, statistics was an important field but jobs were scarce, and at places like research labs. But since Google taught the world where the magic lies, Stanford stats grads are inundated with offers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo - and most importantly - countless startups.<p>Many of the best data scientists I have met studied physics. After the dry complex problems they have faced, commercial applications are human, exciting, straightforward, and a way to make an impact. (yes all our basic advances came from physicists doing physics. Im just saying Data Science could be a great alternative for some people).<p>I know that I'm biased, so take this with a grain of salt, but tech startups can be an exciting place for a data scientist, where you can make a major impact on the financial success of the business and share in that success.<p>Happy to give anyone specific suggestions via email.",1341784754

The monthly conference calls (about an hour long) will allow the startups to monitor each other's traction and hold one another accountable for meeting individual goals/milestones. We want the sessions to be results-oriented and constructive. We will handle the annoying bits like matching startups and scheduling sessions.

The submitter of the article to HN has no affiliation with Postmasculine as far as I know, nor did we request them to post it here. We're very grateful for them doing so however!<p>2. While the author of the site was involved in the pickup industry for a while, he chose to no longer identify with that scene over two years ago, and specifically moved his content away from its perspective, even going so far as to systemically deconstruct the flaws and failures of Pickup theory and the community it created. So we don't feel that 'pickup' really represents what the site has to say about dating. Although we definitely do talk about meeting women. A lot. :)<p>3. While we're dedicated internet marketing students, we're far from experts on the subject. We're putting a lot of time and effort into improving the site's marketing, but our number one focus will always be on providing high quality content that is as no BS and realistic as possible.

4215842,comment,4214480,4215709,22,0,srean,,,"This will need a longer debate, which I might join later tonight given the time I have. I agree that the median is bad, but disagree that it is as bad as the original post made it out to be, some amount of exaggeration is fine as a rhetoric device but overdone at the least it misinforms.<p>EDIT: Given the downvotes I must have rubbed someone the wrong way.<p>When you compare you do need to take into account all the axes, I would be interested in knowing a train system that carries as many commuters for comparable price and profitably (as far as I recall the train system is indeed profitable, dont know if they receive subsidies or  not). You cannot isolate services from who are going to use it and their buying power.<p>I will also posit that that your perception of the median is very different from mine. I speak from personal experience living in several cities/towns in India. Now I have learned enough not to extrapolate. The other thing that we disagree on is that you brush aside the variance saying India is large and variance is natural. I think (a) the mainstream western audience is not familiar with this level of variance and (b) the variance is grossly un-reported.<p>So my post was mostly a way of caution not a rebuttal of the original. Your link illustrates my point well. I doubt that even after accounting for its size that people will expect such a variance in sex ratio.<p>Oh and make no mistake, it has nothing to do with being busy or crowded. Delhi is busy and crowded too, but for a girl that does not prevent one from getting groped. Forget pedestrians, when my sister drives in Delhi/Kolkata other drivers will be trying to harass her by driving aggressively, the traffic cop will try to take advantage. Absolutely none of that happens in Chennai.<p>I cannot speak about your compulsions, but all I can say is that I have obtained a drivers license, a passport and renewed them with not a single paisa paid in bribe. In fact I had to think really hard to remember when did I bribe anyone at all, that was to load a crate in a train (and it wasnt even against the law or something). Main point is that in parts of the country you can do just fine without bribes, whereas in others its a part of life.<p>I havent been there in 3 years, but in my usual haunts in Kolkata garbage does get cleaned up. But again it will vary in the city as well. Yes there are open dumpsters, but no household filth accmulating on the side of the residential streets, going outside of Kolkata this actually surprised me. Compare that to say Kanpur a prominent city in one of the larger states. Its not uncommon to find open animal cadavers, excrement of all possible kind: cow, camel, pig, elephant you name it, in your day to day travel. Yeah I would run into shitting elephants stuck in a traffic jam ! Thats the variance I am talking about.<p>And I think you completely missed the point of comparison of corruption in India and US. And by no means I am justifying the corruption in India. It bothers me deeply that now it has become so acceptable. It is the acceptance of corruption that worries me more than the corruption itself. But, how is installation of backscatter machines not corruption. The semantics are different, the means are different, but the effect is the same. I still have not been able to decide that dollar for dollar per capita which is more corrupt USA or India. I have argued countless times that India is by far the more corrupt one, but now I am not so sure. In India it is in your face all the time, in the US its a background daemon.",1341784023

Is it a good thing that ratings agencies make money from the companies selling the products they rate? Wow, you know what? That's an interesting point!

It seems commercial airlines usually operate in a mode where it is impossible to stall -- pulling back all the way just ascends as fast as the plane can. But, the plane reverted to another mode of operation and the pilot did not understand this. Additionally, the Airbus control system has no physical feedback between the two pilot inputs and just merges the data. So if one pilot is pulling back, the other has no way of knowing. From the transcription, it seems that the pilots were confused as to why they were falling, until they realised the junior pilot was stalling the plane, and by then it was too late to fix.",1341783324

Morals can come from religion or philosophy (or both), and they should be used to guide design decisions rather than those design decisions being made in isolation. Design decisions made without a moral foundation focus on effectiveness alone, which is not a useful indicator for the good's true worth (again, assuming your life is not amoral, in which case none of that would matter), and what I mean by ""true worth"" is how that good benefits society and man in light of your moral framework.",1341782989

4215739,comment,4213162,4214978,1,0,danparsonson,,,"> Having words for different things is useful. It makes language more efficient and reduces the need for clarification :)<p>Well that's my point precisely - the fact that you see gay marriage as being different to heterosexual marriage simply because of who is involved illustrates the flaw in your reasoning. If you think you would feel awkward entering into a conversation with someone who may or may not be gay, may I suggest you refer to their 'partner' or their 'other half' until it becomes clear what gender the person is that you're talking about? Or just be direct and say 'your... wife? husband?'. Most reasonable people really won't mind.<p>But let's be honest - your delicately-phrased attempt to pour logic onto the question does not disguise the fact that your concerns run beyond linguistic convenience. It's a very weak argument.<p>> Similarly, being able to tell the sex of the people involved in a union, is useful information. It means you don't have to ask for clarification, and reduces the chances of faux pas.<p>It's really not that useful - if you need to know, ask, but the chances are that you don't - and as I'm sure you realise, 'mere' language is a powerful tool for enforcing segregation and bigotry. It makes a real difference to the people actually involved, and, if you're honest with yourself, not a jot of difference to you. If you think about it, carving the world up based on sexual preference would be hilarious in its stupidity if it didn't cause so much pain. I mean, honestly, how does anyone's choice of lover alter your life? Millions of people are in happy homosexual relationships RIGHT NOW and I bet you hadn't noticed.<p>> To compare it to a persons colour is silly. Sex matters... That's why our language is full of words like son/daughter, waiter/waitress. Colour does not matter, which is why our language doesn't have specific words for say a black waiter. It's irrelevant.<p>Actually, likening the redefinition of 'marriage' to the redefinition of 'man', as you did in the parent comment, is silly. The parallel I was drawing was between predjudice that existed (and in places still does) based on racial differences and the predjudice that you are demonstrating, whether you realise it or not, against homosexuality.",1341781995

4215709,comment,4214480,4215220,21,0,ashishgandhi,,,"SHORT REPLY<p>Your theme throughout had been that there's variance in India. Of course! With any big country you would expect good amount of variance. I couldn't help but point out that although there is variance whatever the orignal blog post said was a very good reflection of the meidan. By citing the high variance you are making it sound like the OP has only seen the bad parts of India. That's not true. The OP has a very gentle (yes!) summarization of the median. That's how life is in India.<p>LONGER POINT-BY-POINT REPLY<p>> One thing that I do want to mention is that India is a very high variance country. For almost any statement one makes, there will be a un-ignorable part of the country where the statement is not true. To get a truer picture of India, always keep that in mind.<p>It is very high variance indeed. But for every mile of good road there are millions of miles of crappy road. Variance yes. But the median is pretty sucky.<p>> Depending on the time you choose to travel, your impression of Mumbai's city train system can be poles apart.<p>How is it different? During rush hours it's unsafe, super-over-crowded, uncomfortable, dirty, etc. When it isn't rush hour it is not super-over-crowded yes. But it still is unsafe (no closing doors, etc.), uncomfortable (plank seats which broken planks, etc.), dirty (very very dirty), etc.<p>> On the other hand visit Chennai, Mumbai, Pune (by no means an exhaustive list) nobody will give it a second thought if an unattended girl has to travel in the wee hours of the night, even if wearing a mini fortune in jewelery.<p>Well, I can talk about Mumbai, and I disagree that nobody will give a second thought. But girls being out late (around until 11:00 PM) alone (""unattended"") in Mumbai is not that bad because the city is still busy and crowded. In Gujarat things are much safer. But we used to still accompany our female friends back home.<p>> In certain regions of India, you will find bribes to be business as usual. In the south, (barring Karnataka) that is certainly not the norm.<p>I have no first hand experience but that's very very hard to believe. Especially given how elections are conducted. Whenever there's an election in Tamil Nadu (of which Chennai is the capital) you free television sets being given out by the ruling part to votes who vote for them. Fairly educated people working in other parts of India like Mumbai would go back home to get their free TVs. Ton of universities are owned and operated by current or former politicians in South India. Admission criteria is how much money can a student's family ""donate"".<p>> Some cities are poster-children of bad traffic, some are pretty decent compared to Indian average.<p>That's just saying some are very horrible while other are not as bad (Indian average) but still not comparable to anywhere else on the planet?<p>> In some cities the form of the garbage disposal is that you throw it on the street, whereas in others you will have regular system that collects it off the dumpsters and empties it on the landfills.<p>I think all cities have a regular system that collects garbage and uses landfills. But these garbage collectors don't collect all the garbage and there's 10x fallen on the sides, overflown and just laying there around such dumpsters. They'll collect a bag or two that is <i>inside</i> the dumpster AND easy to grab. I agree there would be certain parts (and again, these exists; variance; but are in minority, very small minority; median) that are decently run. But would love to hear about examples of cities where you could say the city is clean and is cleaned.<p>> In the northern and western states girl child foeticide is rampant, not so in the other states.<p>Only two states have more females than males (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_and_territories_ranking_by_sex_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_and_territories_r...</a>). Since females are expected to live 3 years longer than males in India (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expec...</a>) all states should have more women than men. Just because Tamil Nadu (say) has 995 females per male doesn't mean that's going very well. In fact, it's still pretty bad. Maybe not as bad as other states but is no way justifiable. Lastly, variance, yes. Median, still horrible.<p>> Lastly: Corruption is practiced differently in India and US. In US there is this revolving door between corporations and the govt that legitimizes corruption, whereas in India it is closer to cash under the table. Not claiming that one is better or worse than the other, just making an observation about how it is practiced.<p>If a cop stops me for not having a driver's license, not wearing a helmet on a two-wheeler, talking on the phone, etc. I pay the cop Rs. 50 instead of the Rs. 100 fine and not ask for the receipt. Job done. If in Mumbai I apply for a passport and that calls for police verification of address you have to actually go to the police station (they don't come to you) and bribe(?) them with Rs. 100 to do their job. They never verified your address and if you didn't pay up they would report that you don't live at your place. I could go on and on with this but essentially this is how the country is run. If you are saying that's the same as US then I don't know what to say.",1341781434

Go ahead, learn algebraic topology so that you can understand category theory properly, then when you encounter it in CS you'll know what people are talking about.<p>I think there is a point of diminishing returns.<p>Baby Rudin I'm dubious about.  But Royden and big Rudin (both of which you recommended) I have certainty about.  There are good reasons that I never saw CS students in my real analysis classes.  I don't think it is particularly valuable for CS either then or now, to acquire a deep understanding of real analysis.<p>And yes, I know about measure theory.  I know how it applies to probability.  But I went the other way.  I learned measure theory.  Then I learned probability.  Then I began having to do probability stuff in the real world.  And not once has my measure theory background been particularly relevant.<p>As for Hilbert and Banach spaces, they are key pieces of mathematics.  In fields from wavelets to optimization theory, they come up over and over again.  But I would wager that most computer science professors do not need to know what Hilbert and Banach spaces are.  I'd even bet that most have not heard of the Hahn-Banach theorem.  Again, if you find yourself going that way, learn it later.<p>On combinatorics and graph theory, you claim that people will learn enough of that material elsewhere.  Maybe, maybe not.  But it is clear that programming problems routinely get turned into graph theory problems, many of the most important programming algorithms are about graph theory (start with the traveling salesman problem and work your way through the list of NP-complete problems), and at its heart, analyzing an algorithm's run-time is a combinatorics problem.  Acquiring the necessary concepts and vocabulary for those is necessary, whether you classify the book you're learning from as a math text or a CS text.",1341781345

It stops representing the public interests and begins defending the incumbents from market forces that motivate those incumbents to compete fairly, offer reasonably current services or even innovate new ones as a means to compete.<p>In short, they represent corporate interests while ostensibly being the people's governing body. This is imho, corruption.  I don't know how exactly you regulate this away - perhaps mandate a percentage of the regulators specifically be from outside the industry.<p>Edit: for completion of sentence/thought",1341781336

2208734,comment,2199901,2201497,0,0,collypops,,,"The point made (below) by @dspillet is correct, and important for one very good reason:<p>You will almost definitely have scripts that you have included after these two that depend on the jQuery object existing (otherwise what's the point in having jQuery at all). So imagine this trick wasn't used, and you just served up a local (or CDN hosted) copy of jQuery, then started using it in later scripts. It's reasonable at that point to assume that jQuery exists - which is because each script blocks, or if it doesn't, the browser itself will still make sure they execute in order. So it's perfectly safe to use this script without worrying about the order of things.<p>This is exactly why I (and many others) suggest that you put all of your <script> tags at the bottom of the <body> element. They block page rendering, so if they're in the <head>, or dotted around the <body>, they're going to delay the presentation of the page to the visitor.",1297468755

2208731,comment,2207978,2208651,0,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I agree with the gist of your response. I think we just disagree on the semantics of software in this case. Software being ""instructions"" that control the operation of hardware doesn't apply to a biological brain because the instructions are a combination of the state of each neuron and the connections each neuron makes with its neighbors, which themselves change over time. There may be higher level abstractions that can exist independent of a neural network as its basis, but I wouldn't label that the software in the case of a biological brain.<p>Even if there are higher level abstractions yet to be discovered, neural nets can open the door to them by allowing us to create more life-like simulations and then run experiments on it. I can imagine this is rather difficult in an actual biological entity.",1297468739
2208730,comment,2208476,2208704,0,0,johnwatson11218,,,"OK, that is good to know. I had talked to somebody about this problem several years ago and I had thought that you could start with some kind of metric space and see which songs were 'close' to each other. The guy I was talking to seemed to view the problem as a kind of Bayes Theorem problem. The example being that if you had some obscure Beatles album then you most likely had 'Abbey Road' but the inverse probably wasn't true and that is where a software service could step in ... to recommend the obscure album as one you would probably like.<p>One thing that I really like about the service is finding artists that seem to lead to lots of other great songs. It isn't always who I think it is. For example on a lark I put in ""New Radicals"" because I liked one of their songs and I was so impressed with how well that defined a particular sound. When I put in big names like the Beatles or Rolling Stones I don't think I left those stations defined for very long. I wonder is there is some kind of structure to the what Pandora has calculated that could show which bands or songs seem to be most influential.",1297468708

With enough care they'll constrain any future government, protect fundamental freedoms and kill two birds with one stone by easing Western fears about the Muslim Brotherhood assuming power.<p>They would do well to learn from South Africa's example in this. I honestly believe that if it was not for the phased departure of apartheid from 1990 to 1994, combined with the constitutional convention and the preservation of the national police and the military, South Africa's transition would have ended in disaster. In the end the security forces played a massive role in creating a stable enough environment for the vital negotiations to take place and without the work of the military behind the scenes it's doubtful that the 1994 election would have happened at all.<p>So the biggest mistake now would be to rush this.

""Not work related"" gives you an incomplete picture (not related to who's work?).  That it is not related to your work is not enough.  It must not be related to the employer's line of work, or anticipated line of work.  Even if one person in the company is working on a related item, the your work may belong to the company.  Even if one person in the company is anticipating the same, you have a potential issue.  (See item 3 below for a related issue.)<p>2.  The normal meaning of ""related"" also should not be taken at face value.  If you are making burgers for MacDonald's while making a software side project, you are likely to be OK (and I am guessing that McDonald's would make you sign an employment agreement for these issues also).  If you are in sales for a technical company and are making a software, they can easily be considered to be ""related"" by your company or the court.<p>3.  Keep in mind that in any case the onus of proving is on you, so you the legal costs of proving you are clean would fall on you.  That also means that in case of trouble, the court may initially side the employer and wait for you to prove you are clean to turn to your side.",1297467338

If you look at the numbers (image in the article) The $328k loss also includes some exceptional charges, they made an operating profit of $1.15M in the period.<p>Their revenues in the same 9 months of last year were $31m, so they have tripled their revenues year on year.

The greater legitimacy of a government as a member of the international community of states might be influenced by whether it's democratic or not but is determined mostly by that governments actions and stated intentions.

The truth is that encouraging rapid democratic change in all cases would be foolish and irresponsible, because it could lead to far worse outcomes than the status quo.

2208608,comment,2208548,2208548,0,0,Jun8,,,"Well, exact same thing applies to Motorola, they always got the hardware correct but didn't do too well on software, in fact the saying that ""We are not a software company"" was (and even now, sometimes is) frequently heard in company discussions. However, Motorola had a deeper problem, which I think Nokia shares, and leads to the above: the culture.<p>Both of these companies had strong engineering (not software) cultures that served them very well in their domains. Up until very recently, that domain was closed off, and had a well-understood status quo. There were some smartass companies in the Valley, like Google etc. but no one paid attention to them.<p>But suddenly, WHAM!, everything became one, suddenly Google is both Motorola's ally and enemy (Android and Google TV), Apple, who used to make cure computers only, is a big competitor. You know the rest. These Titanics had no time to change.<p><i>This</i> is what killed Motorola and is killing Nokia now. Problem is, this cannot be fixed by firing N managers, M engineers and hiring ""better"" ones, because the culture is built into their DNA. You should fire <i>all</i> management and rebuild the culture. Jha is trying to do that with Motorola Mobility (evidently, with limited success, as seen from XOOM pricing and tethering to Verizon).",1297466180

The new standard is intended to achieve substantially better compression performance than that offered by MPEG-2 and possibly comparable to that offered by the AVC Baseline Profile.

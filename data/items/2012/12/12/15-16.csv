The professor does not understand how the world spins around nowadays. \nHe caught that guy,but there is no guarantee nobody else was cheating. Personally,as a non-English student attending a university in the UK I could easily ask questions in a language the professor could not understand, on forums he doesn't know exist. My point being - if somebody wants to get away with it,they will - as many people pointed out,it would be enough if he posted that question under a fake name.<p>So if the professor cannot guarantee that no-one is cheating,then any marks obtained for that exam/homework/whatever are completely meaningless.",1355327979

One of the best ways to distribute these applications is the web using JavaScript. If, for some reason, this distribution channel were removed (let's say it was removed by law) the demand would still be there, and the 'older' channel still remains - native apps.

For all the contents, videos, interviews, samples, one can imagine how much effort being allocated for this. Being famous doesn't entitle someone to be able to charge expensively. Likewise, nothing is stopping anyone out there (""nobody"" or not) to charge the price he or she wanted to. This is what we call internet, it's completely free market. No government or regulatory body is going to say ""Hey Nathan! You are nobody, stop charging people a bloody $200 notes for a piece advice."" Let's put some angles of perspective in, if he successfully sells 1000 copies at $200. He will make $200k revenue. Deduct that with the cost of his labor, his lost opportunity to work on his apps, marketing fee and the support time cost. He will probably pocket 30-40k pure profit. What if he has to follow what people say to price it lower at $20. Selling 1000 copies will barely cover his cost. And where are you going to find 1000 people who will believe this $20 crap going to give you top notch advice on delivering amazing web apps UX and design. Charge premium is a good start. Keep improving the content is a sure way to gain you the loyalty of customers.<p>Back to the odd marketing strategy. Why show it here? Why HN, really? Most will simply want something quick and simple to show the idea behind their hacks to the community. We are frequently being shown unfurnished prototype (indeed twitter bootstrap half the time). Anyone really serious about building well designed and engineered UX web applications will probably have a well funded startup with specialist UX designer onboard. Or someone must have been a long time practitioner of UX to be bothered about putting much focus on UX. It's not as simple as reading a book, listen to an interview, you become great in UX. It's only through years of experience, going through iteration after iteration of UX design tweaks, you will have a basic idea where to lead the good UX direction. A long the way, there are still huge chances to make UX mistakes here and there. Too simplified, or too complicated. Too plain, lack of creative input. Too much boring UX treating every users as dummy as they can. I am sure it will be hard for the community here to start bothering UX before getting their hacks done.

You've mentioned issues with this, and can be bypassed via VPN or using another network. EC2 is attractive because it's so cheap (with spot instances, starts at 0.3 cents per hour), but it's not the only option.<p>2) Timing. Normal traffic isn't rapid fire. Many scrapers, however, fire off their scripts as quickly as possible. Block traffic that doesn't have enough meaningful pauses.<p>3) Report addresses to Amazon. I really don't know if they'd take action.<p>4) Reverse lookup, or whitelist addresses. I know if it's a legitimate source (like Flipboard) they'd probably work with you at least a little bit. Reverse lookup might not be successful, but maybe that can help you whitelist any legit sources that map their AWS IP to a legit DNS name. Most scrapers use the AWS external domain name. Also, I imagine legit sources give you a distinctive user agent, so that can help you let traffic through.<p>However, if you have a public resource, this is simply an issue you have to deal with. \nAnayltics: I'd just filter out traffic scraped traffic from your analytics. Content duping:  blocking scrapers won't stop this. If someone stealing your content can't scrape at 0.5 cents per hour, they'll pay someone 5 cents an hour to copy/paste.

I had to scroll down pretty far past the $200 to see that just the individual book was available (and I'd guess that a ton of people are going to just buy the book, since it's a lot of great content at a really great price!) so rather than lose a lot of buyers at the $200 price point, why not gain them at a lower price point by visually positioning all the bundles together so people can choose?",1355324434

If it's empty, I move some things from the tomorrow list in. Then I fill up the tomorrow list with things from the future work lists.<p>This means I have a list of all the work I need to do, but I don't explicitly plan more than a couple of days ahead - things are too variable for that.<p>Once tasks (in the today list) are done, they get moved to a 'done' list that I can review later.<p>It's simple, and seems to work fairly well for me.",1355324405

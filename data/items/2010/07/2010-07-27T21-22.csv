Unless we know why the user quit using DynDNS, there's no real way to determine whether an appeal like this effective or even appropriate.<p>For example, I used to use DynDNS all the time because I was running a small personal site off my home broadband connection.  Then, thanks to an improvement in fortunes, I was able to afford a hosting service and a ""real"" DNS.  So I switched.  If DynDNS sent me an e-mail like this, it wouldn't really matter, because I've already got everything set up, and I'm not really looking to change.",1280267965

1552805,comment,1550827,1552448,0,0,Tichy,,,"Here's hoping I won't embarrass myself too much...<p>Since presumably your teacher already wrote the solution onto the board, I'll just talk about how I would arrive at a solution.<p>So first of all, it is a very common problem. We must have solved countless polynomial problems at school. So usually, seeing this kind of problem should already ring several bells.<p>So what I associate with polynomials (from school day) is<p>- zero points<p>- factorization<p>- quadratic equation<p>- ""curve discussion"" (don't know the english name for it, determining minima and maxima by calculating differentials)<p>Did you have the same associations? If not, then that is simply a matter of experience that would come with practice. Without that experience, naturally arriving at a solution would be hard.<p>It should be immediately obvious that we can factorize this polynomial without problems: simply because we know that we can factorize every second degree polynomial, thanks to the quadratic equation. This knowledge is basically ""rote learning"", except that you'll probably pick it up without decidedly doing rote learning. The polynomial presented here is already factorized into two second degree polynomials, so no problem there - do you agree so far? (Bonus points for seeing immediately that (x^2-a^2) = (x+a)(x-a) - this is a really common and basic formula that you should probably just ""know"". However, in principle you can also derive it from the quadratic equation, knowing this formula is just a shortcut).<p>So, are these zero points of use after all? Yes!!! We can simply check some values of the function between the zero points and determine if they are greater or less than zero. Since the function can only ""switch sides"" at the zero points, we then know it has to have the same sign (negative or positive) everywhere between those zero points (and same for outside of all the zero points).<p>Do you agree so far? If not, where is that you were stuck?<p>With that idea, let's just determine the zero points. From the (x+a)(x-a) part we already know that a and -a are zero points.<p>Using the quadratic formula on x^2 - 2x + a^|a| I get -1-sqrt(1-2^|a|) and -1+sqrt(1-2^|a|) - just ask if that is too fast, also be aware that I am <i>very</i> prone to make errors in such calculations.<p>From there on, I admit it is not much fun. We have to somehow order the zero points, so that we now when the sign could change. So we have to make case distinctions.<p>In fact, I haven't yet thought further than this, and now I am looking for ways to make it easier (I hate case distinctions). Laziness is the main motivator for maths, therefore I am not that much in favor of the rote learning approach...<p>So one step back: we have a products of two polynomials, poly1*poly2 with poly2 = x^2-a^2. That product is > 0 if poly1 > 0 and poly2 > 0 or poly1 < 0 and poly2 < 0 (if this is not obvious, please ask).<p>It is clear that poly2 < 0 for |x| < |a| and > 0 for |x| > |a|.<p>So let's look at poly1 = (x+1-sqrt(1-2^|a|))(x+1+sqrt(1-2^|a|)) (if my calculation was correct).<p>Since 1-sqrt(1-2^|a|) < 1+sqrt(1-2^|a|) we get<p>poly1 < 0 for -(1+sqrt(1-2^|a|)) < x < -(1-sqrt(1-2^|a|)) and > 0 for x < -(1+sqrt(1-2^|a|)) or x > -(1-sqrt(1-2^|a|))<p>So alltogether, the (intermediate) solution is<p>(-(1+sqrt(1-2^|a|)) < x < -(1-sqrt(1-2^|a|)) and |x| < |a|)
or (x < -(1+sqrt(1-2^|a|)) or x > -(1-sqrt(1-2^|a|))) and |x| > |a|<p>I have a feeling this should be simplified further, but I'll post it like this because it becomes a little bit intractable in the small comment box of HN. Maybe I'll find time to finish later.<p>Anyway, I probably made mistakes, and overlooked some much easier approach. The main point is that most of the steps are very common approaches, and I think/hope I demonstrated dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.<p>One advice I would give for maths is to not be intimidated - you need a little bit of faith... If you fear the equations, you'll be too paralyzed to find a solution.<p>Also, I used to cheat a little bit on the problems in school: usually chances are high that the problem at hand has something to do with a recent thing the teacher has taught us. So it pays to look for ways to use the knowledge from the latest lessons.<p>Also, this problem seems comparatively ugly.<p>Sorry that this got rather complicated. Let me know how I can help better. I'll try to create a shorter summary of the steps involved. (Meanwhile, please post the shorter solution if there is one and you find it).",1280266314

Say you ban cash, and also introduce a 1984-style police state, and lastly pay for education and health care for all citizens. Crime drops versus the rest of the country. Is it because you're living in a police state, or is it because people are well educated and healthy? This difficulty seems especially problematic when some top level entity is a priori choosing what the new policies will be, versus choosing them as reality indicates.<p>A better system might be to have a number of startup countries, let the people in them choose what laws they will or will not have, and also allow people to move easily between countries, so if the policies enacted in one turn out to suck, people can vote with their feet.

It's common for a proportion of a professor's salary to be ""soft money"" that they have to pay themselves out of grants--- at the very least summer salary (i.e. 25% of full-year pay) is almost always paid out of grants, and increasingly a portion of 9-month salary is as well. So a professor is constantly selling their work not to tenure committees, but to grant agencies, and if they stop doing so, their pay gets a huge chop. They might also end up with more teaching load, depending on the university, since some universities assign more courses per semester to professors deemed ""not research-active"" (and if they really want them out, will start doing things like giving them shitty committee assignments, withholding annual cost-of-living pay adjustments, moving them to bad offices, etc.).<p>More to the point, if we were to abolish tenure, I think we'd also have to reform how academics are evaluated. The current methods focus almost exclusively on some combination of publication count and citation count, driving a strong ""publish or perish"" CV-line-counting culture. A main advantage of tenure is that it opens up some breathing space for more senior academics to take risks on longer-term projects that may or may not pan out, and won't be producing the usual flurry of papers in the early stages.",1280266113

At the moment, I feel a sense of kinship with others who have made this discovery relatively late in life (as opposed to in childhood).<p>In that light, I'll share that my first 6 hours on medication (ie. as of this writing) have been an absolute revelation. I did a few chores around the house, the kind of thing that would usually take three times as long as it should, throw me into a bad mood, be interrupted by three or four stops at the computer to see whether anyone's responded to me on HN, and then end up being done with less than great attention to quality. Instead of that, I felt like I was in flow--for the first time in a LONG time. That usual static in my brain and in my attitude was almost entirely turned off, and instead, I was able to focus my attention and energy on efficiently and effectively solving the problems and accomplishing the tasks that were part of the job.<p>One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises was that I generally didn't misplace any of my tools while I was working. Usually, I spend several irritating chucks of thirty seconds or more trying to track down the pliers or the sand block. That didn't happen at all this time.<p>Also, and I'm sure this sounds pathetic to those who can't relate, I would often be faced with the most trivial of decisions, the most minor of challenges, and that would throw me off entirely, compounding all of those negatives I described above. This time, when a challenge was before me or a choice had to be made, it seemed like the most natural and normal thing in the world for me to quickly assess the situation, the options, and immediately settle on a likely solution and put it to the test without delay. All without duress and without effort.<p>I see what you mean about becoming a bit of an evangelist for this.

A 6 pack of crummy beer is $14 across the street from my office, and a studio in Harlem is still $2,000/mo.  Realistically, $100k/year in NYC is like $60k/year elsewhere.  I know quite a few people making six figures that live 2 hours outside of the city because they can't afford it and I've read that you shouldn't even consider having kids in Manhattan until your household income is over $200k/yr.<p>Second, IME a lot of startups in NYC have deep pockets.  I believe this is because most of the startups in NYC are funded by big companies with NYC HQs.  Otherwise, they'd start up elsewhere because everything about running a biz is expensive in NYC (employee wages, taxes, rent, etc).<p>Third, there's a talent drought in NYC.  <i>If</i> a tech savvy type of guy wants to be on the east coast, they usually end up Boston/Cambridge.<p>High cost of living + startups w/ lots of coin + talent shortage = $$$$ for devs.<p>Also, I made some broad generalizations.  There are plenty of self-funded startups in NYC too.",1280264497

PEP 380 provides a syntax for having sub-generators which can potentially be used to factor your code into smaller, reusable components.<p>PEP 380 is about providing better support for nested generators including the scaffolding with try/finally, g.send(), g.next(), g.throw(), and g.close().<p>In short, PEP 380 lets you nest, and nesting lets you factor your code.",1280264458

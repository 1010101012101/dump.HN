So, yeah, I could go HiDPI and lose all the screen real-estate, but that seems like a poor tradeoff. I&#x27;d have to get a larger, more limited, device like the X1 (really, the only other option) to enjoy HiDPI without having a small desktop.<p>And, all things considered, I don&#x27;t think hidpi is ready yet. ThinkPads already overheat and have shitty battery life. Having to handle 4x the pixels seems like it&#x27;ll only hurt things.

The cars were at best several hundreds of horsepowers more powerful than current wrc cars, with much inferior handling. Most cars, if any, didn&#x27;t even have power steering back then.<p>Also the races were much longer taking place over about 5 days compared to the 3 day events nowadays. One event had about 40-50 special stages back then when now there are about 15-25 and most of those are just the same stages repeated. In addition they used to drive both day and night while while getting only a few hours of sleep per night. I&#x27;m sure current rally races are still pretty grueling events, but those drivers in the 80s must have been superhuman.<p>I&#x27;m still glad that things have changed. If they hadn&#x27;t cancelled Group B the fatality count would have just increased. The cars were getting totally out of hand. Some rumors say that some prototype cars already built for the 87 season had close to 1000 horsepowers.",1427786912

As long as your loops are predictable I&#x27;d suggest not worrying about them.  Correctly predicted branches are very close to free, and fitting the entire loop in the decoded µop cache is more important.  There are still cases where it helps, but there are also cases where where the instruction mix works out so that there is zero overhead.  Not just low, but zero. So until you&#x27;ve measured, keep your loops short and simple.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d suggest that if you want to write really high performance code, you need to be thinking in assembly regardless of the language you are writing the actual code in.  Look at the code that&#x27;s actually executing, either by disassembling the compiled object or profiling with something like &#x27;perf&#x27; on Linux.[1]  Then, you need to be aware of how the processor handles that assembly, in terms of latencies and execution ports.

    The sky, lazily disdaining to pursue
       The setting sun, too indolent to hold
       A lengthened tournament for flashing gold,   
    Passively darkens for night’s barbecue,

    A feast of moon and men and barking hounds,   
       An orgy for some genius of the South
       With blood-hot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth,   
    Surprised in making folk-songs from soul sounds.

    The sawmill blows its whistle, buzz-saws stop,
       And silence breaks the bud of knoll and hill,
       Soft settling pollen where plowed lands fulfill   
    Their early promise of a bumper crop.

    Smoke from the pyramidal sawdust pile
       Curls up, blue ghosts of trees, tarrying low   
       Where only chips and stumps are left to show   
    The solid proof of former domicile.

    Meanwhile, the men, with vestiges of pomp,   
       Race memories of king and caravan,
       High-priests, an ostrich, and a juju-man,
    Go singing through the footpaths of the swamp.

    Their voices rise . . the pine trees are guitars,   
       Strumming, pine-needles fall like sheets of rain . .   
       Their voices rise . . the chorus of the cane
    Is caroling a vesper to the stars . .

    O singers, resinous and soft your songs
       Above the sacred whisper of the pines,
       Give virgin lips to cornfield concubines,
    Bring dreams of Christ to dusky cane-lipped throngs.</code></pre>",1427786248

It&#x27;s interesting to see that many seem to have fallen in love with poetry that&#x27;s been translated to English. While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with translation, I do think it is a little curious that some seem to prefer translated poetry, to native language authors (Much as it&#x27;d be a bit curious to hold up Blake as one&#x27;s favourite poet in Spanish).

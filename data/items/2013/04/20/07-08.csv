Lack of focus on ""just <i>making</i> (cool) stuff"" (compare it with ""Dive Into Python"" and other Python or Perl tutorials) - it didn't feel ""hacker/maker spirit"" at all<p>2. Too many words, too little code - I think in code, pictures and occasionally equations: words are ok too, but not when their only purpose is making ""opinionated"" jokes. And the illustrations literally hurt my brain - I expect nicely crafted images that explain concepts, not weird jokes that have nothing to do with them!<p>3. Not many interesting concepts - I'm ok with not focusing on making ""coll stuff"" with a piece of technology you're just learning and with not being ""hacker spirited"", but if you don't do it this way, at least present interesting mind-opening concepts to the reader (just compare it with ""Practical Common Lisp"" or a Haskell tutorial - they give you so much tasty mindfood that the style doesn't even matter anymore, they could've been written in the style of a medical research article and still be enjoyable to read). Ruby didn't bring any interesting new concepts to me - it was Smalltalky OOP and the coolness of blocks that could've been just lambdas anyway...<p>4. Lots of stupid jokes that I didn't find funny at all, and made me feel stupid that maybe there was something I didn't understand but was supposed to, and cultural references that were very ""WTF"" (I'm European, but I've been pretty well exposed to US culture and I like ""american style humor"" but this felt like totally from a different planet).<p>5. This one is subjective don't mean to offend, just to be honest: I hate the whole gay (not necessarily in a sexual way), touchy, feely, friendly way of presenting technical things - I'm more of a ""cold British humor"", occasional ""mildly offensive jokes"" and a touch of ""mental testosterone"" kind of guy (this is the king of attitude that, for example, appeals to me in an aesthetic way: <a href=""http://programming-motherfucker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming-motherfucker.com/</a> )<p>6. Despite being clear that learning resources like WPGR were opinionated and would only appear to people whose minds work in a certain way, they were recommended to <i>all newbies</i>. I like a culture that doesn't shove opinionated stuff in the face of new guys - first let them find ""their own way"", then show them the ""opinionated ways"".<p>7. There was a ""split personality"" thing that annoyed me: Ruby as a language appealed to the ""hacker spirited"" a lot, but the community was pulling in different direction that I couldn't really comprehend - a weird lust for a code-aesthetic-nirvana or something...",1366444408

They became comfortable in their baby boomer audience (every pledge drive featuring Joan Baez being the giveaway) and they haven't really groomed a younger audience coming up.  A certain smugness and belief that they were just naturally a superior option to the mainstream garbage meant they didn't put the effort in to innovate and improve their product.  Where they did innovate is in sponsorships which are no different to ads nowadays - often npr-washing unsavory companies through extended ""brought to you by..."" then a bunch of copy worse than any ad, stated unchallenged.<p>I stopped listening partly because I was getting really offended by some of that stuff, and as stated above this brain science stuff really got on my wick.  But also because the quality of the news in the morning was garbage.  Firstly very little news, way too much human interest story.  Secondly the reportage was pretty shoddy.  Thirdly the analysis was facile, ill-informed and wrong way too often.  Certainly not as bad as something like CNN, Fox etc. but not the quality they boast about.  And when you can now get the BBC news anywhere in the world you can easily see what a poor product the NPR news has become.<p>I guess finally the talking heads are just so outdated.  They represent a washington-insider-y worldview that has little or no bearing on reality.  They're an aging media corps which still thinks things run the way they do at their cozy DC cocktail parties, genteel disagreements but we all get along.  They have little to say that matches the bitter corrupt partisan nature of things in the US today.  It's not that I want them to perpetuate that, but denying it exists helps no-one.

Other optimizations get tripped up by type guards, and cant do much useful work). Not to mention that LLVM is huge, and it can be a painful dependancy (especially given the above)<p>Another problem for LLVM as a portable platform is that LLVM bytecode is, well, not portable.

There is added insulation between each cell to prevent a short-circuit within the lithium-ion cells from cascading to others.<p>Even if the battery does fail and overheat, Boeing officials said, its new sealed steel enclosure system, with cooling and venting, will prevent a fire and contain the problem to the battery itself, protecting the rest of the aircraft. As part of testing, propane was used to create a small explosion inside the enclosure, which was successfully kept contained within it. Boeing claims that the enclosure will not only isolate a possible battery failure from the rest of the aircraft's components, but that passengers won't even notice if a failure occurs.<p>There are some unanswered questions that remain. Boeing was never able to replicate the failure that caused the Japan Air Lines 787 to catch fire in its tests of the old design. And considering that the original reason Boeing selected lithium-ion batteries for the 787 was their relatively low weight, the additional provisions would seem to cancel out much of the benefit of the technology.<p></quote>",1366442247

LLVM provides a framework for compile time code generation plugins.

The difference primarily lies in the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection  thus the plugins.<p>[...]\nOn the plus side, this means that you should be able to integrate LLVM with an existing runtime.

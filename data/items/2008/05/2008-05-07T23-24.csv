As far as I am concerned, reducing it to 0% is wholly acceptable.<p>At the very least have the lawyer send her a letter stating that the work she was to perform and which she was paid to do, was not completed and was not up to acceptable standards.  This can form the basis of denying the equity stake later.",1210204372

Do you really think some 20-something upstart needs to see business cards? We've got e-mail, text messaging, and iPhones for that!

They run an On Demand Entertainment business (music, movies, games and sport) where the content is 'unmetered' (when downloaded it does not get attributed to your Usage Allowance). They also have exclusive rights to online AFL content (national league of Australian rules football), so you can't watch AFL matches, press conferences and various other things online unless you use Telstra as your internet provider.<p>FYI, you can see their exorbitantly priced plans here:

I had never realised that these kinds of thing were not net neutral. If these features were revoked, my internet bills would increase by 25%, which I obviously would not be too pleased about. Gah, now I am troubled; I'll be thinking about this all day.<p>EDIT: It appears these kinds of things are net neutral, because they don't restrict other people's packets.",1210202263

It can mean your wife / significant other, your kids, and your family. It can be ""about"" them and not the ""other"" people.<p>In a subtle way I guess I've been like you, neglected social aspects and focused on my business to the point where I only have a few firm friends. Life is still not, however, ""about"" them. Life is about doing what I want to do, but ultimately my wife, my (forthcoming) kid, and to a lesser extent, my parents.<p>The trick in life, I'm finding, is to still have respect for people, try hard, and be able to support yourself while you nurture the things you appreciate most. For me, that'll be my ambitions and my family. Friends will be a bonus. For you, perhaps, it's programming for now, and family later. Go with what feels ""nice.""",1210202078

183970,comment,183846,183846,0,0,randomhack,,,"Well everything ""social"" certainly has a very large mindshare and buzzshare nowadays. This is due to very nature of social apps and also due to the fact ""social"" apps are relatively new. The buzz of social apps is also much greater in the developer community since the basic ideas are something that everyone understands. Not every developer will be able to talk about hospital software for example but every Joe can talk about ""chat widgets"".<p>But it certainly does not have an equivalent revenue share. Put the PROJECTED revenue in 2009 of all ""social"" apps/platforms together and still you would still be at far less than $10bn.<p>You certainly can make a lot of money by building useful non-social software.

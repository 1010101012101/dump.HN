There are of course grammatical and regional variations on this expression but the implication and import are always one and the same: that the company in question will not get funded. Among investors discussing a deal, the mere whiff of this hirsute quality will often suffice to end a discussion of the company's merits and shortcomings. In this post, however, I intend to delve into exactly what the range of characteristics exhibited by a company and/or its founders are that embody this dreaded state of 'hairiness'.",1271623963

1275465,comment,1275035,1275323,0,0,wortiz,,,"I'm going to chime in from experience and say that your college algebra students are the bottom of the barrel in regards to math students.  With that respects there can be many reasons why they are there: they didn't care about math, they never really understood math, and/or they never really tried to get math.<p>If you are judging the ability of finishing word problems in the textbook, I'm assuming for homework assignments, and they really don't understand the actual math I think your problem is probably that most are using a solutions manual or spending what would seem too much time solving the homework problems.<p>As for solving word problems or practical problems I believe that this is exactly what math should be for especially at the college algebra level.  To be serious most students entering college who want or are going to pursue a degree in mathematics are going to start off closer to the calculus level and maybe trigonometry depending on underlying circumstances.  What people in college algebra are going for is a degree where math has to be practical and the more diverse applications they see the better.  To give a simple example take logarithms: if you were to teach logarithms on the sole basis of algebraic symbols and expressions when it comes time that these students need to apply logarithms to real world problems (like say compound interest) there is going to be a good chance that they didn't really comprehend logs when they were taught them and won't be able to use them properly.<p>Which brings me to another point for word problems: word problems exist because they make students think and relate math to the real world it is fundamental to learning for many students to apply mathematical concepts in a multitude of ways in order to actual grasp a concept and one of the easiest ways to do this is to place that concept into word problems.",1271623462

There are (sometimes surprising) interactions between various elements, and it is their arrangement that the game is based upon.  The layout of various levels is subtly expressive; there's a sense in which the player is getting inside the level designer's head by playing their level (this is, IMO, an overlooked aspect of many video games.  Level design is an expression of the designer's thoughts!)<p>There are some definitions of ""art"" this would not meet, and others that it would.

Taking the hot dog stand for example they're going to spend most of their money on merchandise and rent which aren't assets that can be repossessed.  For those few assets that can be repossessed a bank has to go through petitioning a court to give them permission to repossess, then they have to pay someone to repossess the merchandise and then they have to pay to auction off the merchandise.  That's a lot of money to spend for what amounts to some tables and a grill.<p>The same is true of most new businesses.

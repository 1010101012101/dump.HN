4896118,comment,4895372,4895372,4,0,anonymous,,,"I'll be interested to see if Valve will release a Linux-only or a Linux/Windows hybrid box. It is possible today to have a system where you keep two VMs suspended - a linux vm and a windows vm and thaw one to run the program you need, with pci pass-through to give it full control of the video card. This is quite feasible if they go with ATI hardware that has open documentation.<p>Save system state, boot windows vm, launch game (somehow passing the information to the steam instance in the windows vm, but that's the least of your worries), once game finishes, freeze vm, restore system state and show regular steam-on-linux interface.<p>I've had before the idea of building a system built on a hypervisor that lets you dynamically switch vms, but the high cost of hardware with an iommu and the pretty astronomical cost of this for a hobby project (i.e. my lazyness) have kept me from doing it.",1355086774

You end up taking the average of several very different societies segregated along racial/economic lines.<p>Take Chicago for example. You'd think it'd be a very diverse city, given that it's about 1/3 white, 1/3 black, 1/3 hispanic. Except it's not. I was walking down Michigan Ave the other day (where the high-end retailers are) and literally 99% of the people around me were white. Chicago is actually a collection of racially segregated neighborhoods, each internally quite homogenous and with dramatically different access to healthy food, nutritional education, etc.",1355086761

Taking responsibility of ones actions - sure, but taking the blame even for random events is useless. \nWhy does it matter whose fault it was, as long as you can learn from it? You don't need to feel guilty in order to spot the errors. It looks like making me feel worse about myself without any good reason. Guilt is a powerful mechanism and abusing it like that might lead bad consequences.",1355086638

Whatever a ""vanilla"" kernel is, it doesn't make sense to compare it directly to a ""vanilla"" operating system.<p>> I think you are misinformed. Both rpm/deb ARE binaries. You (and poster) might have meant ""executables"", which I didn't really pay attention to because it's a strawman.<p>You won't run into any problems if you have EITHER:<p>1. A properly compiled static binary\n2. The compileable source code<p>Because of Debian's policies regarding open-source software, in practice #2 will be satisfied for any .deb package you care about.<p>It doesn't make sense to complain about <i>improperly</i> built packages or build files, because I can easily create a build process that will fail on some BSD systems and not others too - there are many ways you can either accidentally or intentionally hardcode system-specific attributes into a script; the filesystem layout is only one small portion of compatibility.<p>> It's been a while, but a few years ago, you might get a script that hashbangs ""/usr/bin/perl"" where your system only supports ""/bin/perl"". It's easy to fix, either in the script or by making perl available in the other place<p>There are more elegant ways of fixing this too. In practice, though, it's not a problem. Not only are there tools that will automate this process, but very few scripts are written this badly nowadays anyway. I run a distribution that doesn't use one of the common package formats, and I can't remember a single time in the last two years I had a problem binary portability because of <i>distribution</i>-specific issues.",1355086596

A properly compiled binary or a compatible source file should run on any distro - not just any modern distro, but any older one as well (assuming that it has the correct dependencies installed, etc.).<p>Yes, if you feel like spending two hours compiling some code and twice that to debug some issues with the bug system on your repo. Fortunately this does not happen a lot, but it happens. Most of the things that are not in the package repositories for your distro is going to give you a hard time (6h install time might be reserved for extreme cases tough, if you are a seasoned linux veteran).<p>Btw, I suppose the problem is the same between the different BSDs.",1355086543

4896104,comment,4895335,4895335,29,0,bpatrianakos,,,"This is not a good thing. In the context of the article it seems more like a defense mechanism than anything else. Yes, it's good to take responsibility and people don't do it as often as they should but to take on the mentality that everything is your fault is unhealthy. In this context it looks like it stems from a need to be powerful and in control all the time.<p>The truth is, we can only control efforts, not outcomes. Sometimes things aren't your fault, you are the victim and while believing its your fault may shield you from feeling bad about it, it ultimately sets you up for failure. When you believe everything is within your control you're in for a rude awakening because a lot of bad random shit will end up happening. Once enough bad things pile up and you're still thinking its your fault, those feelings you're trying avoid by pretending you're all powerful will begin to bubble up and then you think ""not only is everything my fault, but no matter how much I learn I just can't get most things right. So now I'm in control and suck at it"".<p>This is classic avoidance. A defense mechanism. A more healthy attitude would be to identify what is in your control as well as realize and admit the things that are out of your control and cope with them as they come. By all means, take responsibility and he in control of your life because lord know most people aren't but also remember that there's no shame in admitting some bullshit happened that was out of your control and subsequently feeling bad about it.<p>What happens if there's a natural disaster? It's your fault you didn't predict it and lived or worked in a certain place? What about a key figure in your business dying suddenly? Are you at fault for not keeping good enough watch? The example of someone being rude right in the article is a great one! Of course it isn't your fault if someone is rude (at least not always)! Sometimes people have shitty days or attitudes and it has nothing to do with you! Besides being a defense mechanism you could argue that this attitude may stem from egomania.",1355086509

One point about our trash - is it ""simply thrown on a big pile"", or is it ""strategically centralized so that future people can effectively recycle it when it becomes economically feasible""?  In a post apocalyptic wasteland, you will find me making runs to the ""grocery store"" that is the trash dump.<p>I think it appealed too much to ""the masses"" to be enjoyed by ""sophisticated"" people.  And I think that the satire bits were much too sparing to really be absorbed by ""unsophisticated"" watchers.  No one under the age of 18 that I talked with has any idea that this movie is a ""withering criticism of where we are"".  Here's why:<p>I do agree with you that the movie had satiric elements, and I agree that it pointed out the specific issues that you say it pointed out.  But if you watch the movie, these issues are only briefly mentioned, they are not explored or analyzed.  If the film was pared down to the satire bits, it would be about 7 minutes long.  The plot of the film was Luke Wilson the time traveler saving the world, the serious satire elements were the setting.  Well if the plot doesn't get the message through, we can use the characters, right?  Unfortunately, the low IQ people in the film were incapable of talking about their problems in a sympathetic way that most people can understand.  Few people recognized that the characters were actually caricatures, because they were so dumb and happy about their lot in life.  When you watch Schindler's List, do you relate to the characters that are unsympathetic oppressors or to the characters that are sympathetic and oppressed?<p>My friends and family were effected much more by the satire in Planet of the Apes, which is very similar movie to Idiocracy.  The main thrust of both plots is ""a hero saves the day,"" and the satire elements are mostly setting.  PotA works as satire because some of the ape and human characters had problems that they were struggling with, just like you and I!  None of the lower IQ people in Idiocracy was struggling with anything; the ""dystopia"" was NOT a nightmare for them, because they had IQs too low to express any anguish and garner any sympathy.<p>I think the movie would have made an excellent short film, and I think Luke Wilson would have been brilliant in it.  It would have made a fantastic Family Guy episode for those that enjoy Family Guy.  It failed as a feature length film which is disappointing from such an effective artist as Mike Judge.",1355085380

Both rpm/deb ARE binaries. You (and poster) might have meant ""executables"", which I didn't really pay attention to because it's a strawman. ""Well, you can run a staticly linked executable!"". Duh. It's likely output will be ""can't find /var/share/blahblah"" because there are very few standalone binaries these days. Once you have 2 files (even if they are statically linked binaries), there are assumptions that must be made about where files other than the binary can be found - is it /etc like LSB, or /package like djb or whatever GoboLinux is using, or whatever NixOs is using. Practically, anything you want to run is going to need some setup - a setup which package managers provide.<p>Furthermore, even textual executables cause problems: It's been a while, but a few years ago, you might get a script that hashbangs ""/usr/bin/perl"" where your system only supports ""/bin/perl"". It's easy to fix, either in the script or by making perl available in the other place - but, as I mentioned before, it is only easy if you know a lot about how the system works.",1355085174

In satellite design, where repair is, of course, impossible; the rule is to never use a solder joint as a mechanical connection.

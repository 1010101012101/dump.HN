The browsers would have to create an alternate parallel scene graph based interface for content. It&#x27;s possible that may eventually happen.

Some of the transitions in Luminosity were built by one of the teams that participated in our private beta, so I reckon that&#x27;s why you may have gotten that impression.<p>Between us and developers that participated in our private beta, many of the iOS transitions found on <a href=""http://capptivate.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://capptivate.co/</a> have been implemented and we&#x27;re challenging Famo.us developers to try an build them all. IMHO, almost all if not all the iOS and Android apps showcased on Capptivate can be implemented with Famo.us. Those demos built so far were built by developers with a wide range of skills from junior to senior. Are all the demos perfect, nope. But do they all demonstrate that you can accomplish with the web pretty much anything you can accomplish in native without jumping through hoops and resorting to hideous hackery.",1400562907

AdSense is very effective at fulfilling the role it was designed for, which is algorithmically filling your least valuable advertising slots.  It is not good at getting top dollar for brand advertising, in fact, it is optimized in entirely the other direction.  Brand advertisers <i>sneeze</i> out numbers which pay for the entire salary bill in a month.<p>This is <i>particularly</i> true if you have an anomalously strong community or an audience which is more valuable than &quot;a generic Internet user in your company.&quot;<p>Even if you&#x27;re not a massive B2C company, there are plenty of niche publishers who quietly receive $500 to $X,000 a month for each of ~6 ad placements rather than taking $125 in &quot;webmaster welfare&quot; from Google.  At that level you don&#x27;t even need a sales force -- just &quot;your ad could be here&quot; leading to a contact page works.",1400562878

7771294,comment,7768900,7770676,4,0,malandrew,,,"Completely agree. I think meteor worked for quite some time secretly before they actually announced what they were doing. It&#x27;s hard to say which was a better approach. Obviously on HN, a community in which I communicate a lot, it hasn&#x27;t been received well, but in other circles that are far removed from the cognoscenti, it takes hype to break through to people far removed from our reality.<p>I have many friends from my home country (Brazil) far removed from San Francisco and the Bay Area that know about what I&#x27;m working on without me telling them. The fact that they know about what Famo.us is working and we don&#x27;t have the luxury of having the visibility of a Google or Apple, is a testament that this approach may have value.<p>Many of us are entrepreneurs here. Having a great technical solution is half the battle. Awareness is the other half. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a long time, and I think there&#x27;s gobs of merit in our solution despite the rough edges. I also know there&#x27;s gobs of skepticism of our approach. If how we&#x27;ve communicated has been less than ideal, but succeeded in getting people to at least try to framework out that either would have dismissed it out of hand or sat on the sidelines waiting for others to test it first, then it might have been worth it.<p>What I do know is that despite some of our foibles, that when someone who is knowledgeable actually takes the time to sit down and build something, they come back a believer in the approach we&#x27;re taking. A few months ago, I replied calmy to one of the first naysayers I encountered early on on reddit who was about to dismiss us. He gave it a shot and he&#x27;s now become one of our biggest supporters.<p>Lastly, to you and everyone else, if the criticism you&#x27;re giving us comes deep down from your values (and is not just a kneejerk reaction and bandwagon haterism), please tell us. It&#x27;s a learning experience. We&#x27;re a pretty motley crew here as Famo.us and not all of us come from an Open Source background, thus not all of us have the same experience upon which to draw when making decisions on how to handle an issue that might be controversial. Some open source ideas are controversial among people with a different business background, just as some good business decisions may be controversial among us that work on open source. Oftentimes the solution that produces the most good is somewhere in the middle. Furthermore, just because someone doesn&#x27;t have the same experience as you or I, it doesn&#x27;t make their decision necessarily invalid, since they may be operating based on experience which we lack and informs them to the contrary to the conclusions we&#x27;d come to. I know that I myself joined Famo.us with far less experience on how to generate attention for the important work I may be working on. I learned a ton about the value of that skill. Sometimes the difference between succeeding or failing with a good solution is generating publicity that increases willingness to experiement with your solution. Howard Aiken once said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about people stealing an idea. If it&#x27;s original, you will have to ram it down their throats.&quot;. The lesson I&#x27;ve learned is that if you&#x27;ve got a good idea and you&#x27;re worried about ramming it down their throats, you&#x27;re probably selling it wrong.<p>Thanks for your thoughtful, balanced comments.",1400562038

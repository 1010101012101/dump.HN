Ubiquitous Millimeter-wave radar is one obvious application, but IR-frequency amplifiers and sampling aren't out of the question.

If you're a radio station and want to allow your listeners to choose each song (in effect what you're saying), what would be the cost per song listened? In the classic model it's very small, but this is only because the radio station pays per song bought, not per song listened. In the new model, the number of used songs would be much greater. How much exactly? This would probably depend on how many songs are chosen from the long tail.<p>Anyways, what is clear is that the difference between a bought song (20-100c) and a listened song (0.0???c) is only a difference in freedom to choose. Sooner or later the two must come to a compromise.",1242305640

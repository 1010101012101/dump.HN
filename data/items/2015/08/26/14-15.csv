Neither has yet really resorted to corporate bribes.<p>That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re seeing them do so well with their own respective bases. While it is undeniable that the general public doesn&#x27;t care about corporate bribery within politics, it is clear that enough people do to seriously bump the limited candidates that fight against it up in the polls.<p>Do I think either can win? I think, in theory, both could win their respective primary. But I also think that if either did win their respective primary then their &quot;message&quot; would be considered too extreme by the moderates which have the biggest swing vote in American elections, Republicans always vote Republican, Democrats always vote Democrat, it is the moderates that are the kingmakers.<p>So ultimately what I think will happen is that both will continue gaining in popularity, but when it comes right down to it, someone more &quot;electable&quot; will win the primary since neither party can afford to actually lose the presidency completely.

Hacker News, r/firefox, and others are very vocal minorities compared to our greater userbase. Sometimes we really need to listen more and change our plans and be more open than we have been, but sometimes the people doomsaying everything we do might have a different opinion if they had all the details and metrics and info (knowing how to navigate Mozilla to find info about something is a skill in itself).<p>> I&#x27;ve also heard that it&#x27;s possible that Pocket could be moved to an extension.<p>I dunno if we&#x27;ve specifically made that decision yet, but it is certainly one of the primary candidates for Go Faster: <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Go_Faster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Go_Faster</a>",1440600920

Also in other countries, private companies own competing rail networks, competing directly against the local government.  (Tokyo is an example, compare Tokyo Metro and Toei.  JR was once the government, but was privatized.  Keio, Tobu, Seibu, Tokyu, etc. were always private companies.)<p>Meanwhile, the government-funded model of public transportation seems to be failing in the US.  The MTA spent billions of dollars buying new trains and resignalling entire lines to run trains every 1 minute 30 seconds.  But didn&#x27;t actually schedule service that frequently, resulting in trains that are un-boardable during rush hours.  (In fact, unresignalled lines have higher levels of service.  The Flushing line runs at 33 trains per hour.  The upgraded Canarsie line only runs 26 tph.)<p>Off-peak service is similarly abysmal, with trains running every 20 minutes as early as 11:00pm, that are often as packed as rush hour trains.  They can&#x27;t afford three more trains per hour to run them at 10 minute headways?<p>With more people using public transportation than ever before, it&#x27;s a sad time for the government to be unable to justify expanding service to meet the needs of the new commuters.  But they are doing a great job of being inept, so it would be great to see the private sector come in and fix things.  I don&#x27;t care who I pay to get to work, I just want to get there quickly and hassle-free.",1440600898

Clojure has an opinionated idea of how state should change over time and that opinion does not include two-way bound attributes. The reason the cljs community is virtually all React is because dom diffing makes the UI effectively a projection from state and that is epochal-time compatible.<p>> How do You make sure that after changing it everything works - even the most obscure option that only one user uses?<p>Depends how your app is designed. In the general case where, say, you&#x27;re doing the equivalent replacing Angular with Ember you just have to do it and lean on tests/QA. I have just recently finished such a refactor and it&#x27;s about as fun as you&#x27;re implying.<p>With the refactor, I have a better plan going forward! We&#x27;re now on the re-frame model. All state is now in the global atom (instead of mostly being in the atom but some being component-local), dataflow is unidirectional, and we&#x27;re capturing all non-determinant actions as event params. Together, it means serializing the state atom and a sequence of events allows playback on the changed code. At least in theory. I wound up having to ship rewrite delayed features and haven&#x27;t taken the time to build recording/playback support.",1440600050

My guess is that this was the problem in your case, particularly if this was your first significant C project.<p>It is possible to run Cooja in an emulation mode too (but only for the MSP430 microcontroller) where the user and OS code is completely isolated from the simulator process - much more reliable and easier to find bugs that break the user code, but much, much slower.",1440599138

The left claims to want a more European style governance model but fail to accept that the EU does not have one healthcare system, does not have one schooling system, and does not have one college system.<p>When you concentrate all power into a small point it makes manipulating that power much easier for the elites. No longer do they have to bribe politicians in each state, just the ones in Washington DC. The founding fathers knew this (they experienced this with the British Monarchy) and that&#x27;s why they intended on having a very limited federal government that had little control over social programs and whose main purpose was to see that states take it upon themselves to enforce rights provided by the constitution.<p>Remember when we integrated schools? The left would like you to believe the DOE is some kind of federal schooling system when in fact all it really does is issue pell grants. The federal government did not take over the schooling sector. The only thing the federal government did was step in when a state refused to integrate.<p>I urge leftists to reconsider their position. I&#x27;m in favor of social programs like single payer healthcare, but having the federal government do it is just asinine. The federal government needs to pass a bill that makes healthcare a right, then leave it up to the states to implement free healthcare. Those that don&#x27;t will be forced to, just like we did when some schools refused to integrate.<p>If you hate too big to fail companies, then why allow one entity to monopolize a whole sector of the economy? As soon as one of these huge social programs fails, down goes the whole economy. It happened in the USSR and it could happen here. Just let the states handle it like they do in the EU. That way, when one states social programs fail it doesn&#x27;t bring down the whole economy. Notice that this is a compromise. The left still gets it&#x27;s healthcare while the right still gets a small federal government. It&#x27;s a win-win. Unfortunately both the left and right would like you to believe that any compromise is giving into the other side, they must perpetuate the idea that you only have one right choice and that if you&#x27;re not with them you&#x27;re completely against them.<p>Bernie&#x27;s biggest problem is the tax code. I don&#x27;t see any plan to reform it or make it simpler, big businesses are already evading taxes through tax loopholes because it&#x27;s so easy to manipulate our centralized tax code. Even if he raises taxes on billionaires he has no way to prevent tax loopholes without complete tax reform.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to compare the US to socialized countries like individual European nations because most European nations aren&#x27;t world powers policing the globe and have much more economic and political stability. Most socialized European nations aren&#x27;t experiencing social unrest or widespread disagreement about social policies.<p>The US on the other hand has much more disagreement. The USSR consisted of many countries dominated by the Soviets who didn&#x27;t agree with many policies of the government. While the US isn&#x27;t taking over other countries and making more US states, the states are already similar to small countries.<p>As we concentrate power more and more at a federal level we take away sovereignty from the individual states. This, in my opinion is very similar to what lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They spread themselves thin and forced everyone to assimilate under one political ideology. This only works when a large portion of the country agrees with said policies.<p>While the US will probably never suffer the same fate as the USSR, I could easily see us spreading our selves too thin across the globe, mismanaging money, and pissing everyone off, thus leading to economic decline and loss of faith in the political system as a whole (this is already happening).<p>America won&#x27;t be able to handle monolithic socialism.

However, it requires you to read right-to-left3 and inside-out. This is counterintuitive to most of us, and takes some getting over. It is a very real barrier to entry for Lisps.</i><p>Author still doesn&#x27;t get it. Lisp must, in fact, be read from the outside in, left to right --- in the same obvious direction in which it is evaluated. It is not very different from a nested f(x, y, ...) notation, except that the commas are gone, and the f (  exchange position to the ( f arrangement.<p>As a trivial example of why outside-in is wrong, is that if you follow that order, you might believe that (b c) is a function call in (defclass a () (b c)).  The most important fact is that this is a class definition (in ANSI Common Lisp). The leftmost symbol in the outermost form, defclass, is the what McCarthy called the &quot;main connective&quot;. It determines the entire meaning of the interior of the form and all of its subforms, so it behooves us to visit that first. When we recognize that, we then know that (b c) are slots, and not operator b applied to argument c.<p>The right-to-left part is completely bizarre. Why, as a matter of course, would you read the arguments of a form before the main connective symbol? If that, you want, languages for you, there are: Forth, PostScript.",1440598724

When everyone has a cellphone, and we can have tons of sensors on vehicles that communicate in real time (and might eventually be self driving), the old model for transit (fixed routes, pickups at fixed times, etc.) doesn&#x27;t make sense anymore.<p>Many socially disadvantaged people would especially benefit from such a modern form of public transportation: if a single mom working a minimum wage job can go to her workplace in 20 minutes rather than 1h30 for the same price, her quality of life would dramatically improve.<p>If you subscribe to the view that the government should provide a set of basic services to all of its population (eg basic food, shelter, education, healthcare, transportation), then what should really happen is that the local public transportation agencies (SFMTA, NYMTA, etc.) should be the ones experimenting with new models and offering incrementally better services to citizens as technology evolves.<p>But that&#x27;s not how it works, because these agencies are bloated, ineffective, and the complete opposite of innovative. In countries where public transportation is in a better shape (e.g. a lot of western european countries) and the government is more left leaning (ie has no qualms making Uber illegal), services like Uber are a bit slower to reach the mass they are in the US, but it&#x27;s still going to happen in the long term.<p>We can&#x27;t have it both ways. Either we go full capitalist, and in this case privatized public transit the Uber way seems inevitable in the long term, creating a 2 tiered public transit system: one privatized that works really well for the higher social classes, and the regular public transit system that will further languish and deteriorate as only poorer people use it (an outcome which I personally hate and find absolutely dystopian). Or we need to figure out a way for local governments to provide those basic services to their citizens, growing and changing them as the technology matures.

I can recommend LispWorks for those: it has a graphical IDE with graphical debugger, and a very nice cross-platform GUI library with native look-and-feel (called CAPI). I think compared to the open-source options, both of those will result in a lot less pulling out of hair. CommonQt is passable, but CAPI is far less of a hassle, especially for cross-platform deployment. The obvious downside is that LispWorks costs money and is not open-source, so is probably most attractive to people developing a commercial product. Also, in the case of using CAPI, you commit to LispWorks as your implementation.",1440598010

The test is not &quot;did latches already exist&quot; but &quot;is it obvious to use them in the method claimed, as the time of application&quot;, and I would strongly argue that it is not, without some evidence to support the contrary.<p>I say this as someone who has worked as a patent examiner and understand the law (not the US law exactly, but they&#x27;re quite similar world wide).",1440597679

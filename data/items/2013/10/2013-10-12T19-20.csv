It doesn&#x27;t enumerate the particular 110 people and attempt to sort the ones who acquired their wealth via illegitimate methods from those who didn&#x27;t.<p>It simply implies that there was some unified pool of wealth owned by an abstract aggregation called &quot;Russia&quot;, and these 110 people have claimed tremendously disproportionate shares of this wealth, without any substantive evidence being offered that this is what actually happened.<p>Sure, perhaps the Soviet state controlled most of the wealth within its territory while it existed, but the Soviet state acquired control of that wealth by simply seizing it from its previous owners; can we be absolutely sure that none of those 110 were simply using the corrupt institutions of the subsequent Russian state to reclaim wealth that was properly theirs in the first place?<p>I&#x27;m not making any apologies for the Russian government here; it&#x27;s entirely possible and quite probable that many people in Russia do indeed manipulate a corrupt political system in order to capture other people&#x27;s wealth for themselves.  What I&#x27;m criticizing here is the <i>article</i>, which presumes, without arguing the case, that people owning large amounts of wealth is somehow itself evidence that abuse has occurred, and which implies through its wording that wealth originates, initially unowned, in some kind of aggregation.",1381607749

That is the real issue here when we want to throw around terms like &quot;sexual assault&quot;.  What matters is the intent of the person when they commit these acts not that technical some sexual contact was made that was not invited when two adults in a bar that are drunk are engaging in personal contact.   Nothing in this article tells us the Joe intended to assault her, only that he made a very bad decision in making a move like that before being invited to.  Maybe he felt that was were it was leading from the fact that she never pulled away during 3 personal contacts that were progressive.

Note as well that she is going out of her way to be circumspect about the identity of the person in question; I am perfectly willing to believe that there&#x27;s more to the story but that she is choosing to exercise some discretion to avoid impinging on the person as an individual and also to avoid the possibility of a libel accusation. I don&#x27;t think ageism is a big issue here since the star hire was apparently happy to end up reporting to the author&#x27;s (then) 32 year old cofounder, and the author appears to be of a similar age.<p>The point I&#x27;m making above is that the grandparent poster seems to have some need to make up facts that are not present in the original story in order to justify his angry tone. In short, I think he has a giant chip on his shoulder.<p>What I think you and a lot of other posters are missing is the import of her paragraph about how diversity costs; when they were a freewheeling write-the-r-own-rules startup they could afford to blow off or ignore anyone who tried to leverage personal biases such as sexism, ageism, or anything really. Once they were funded and had investors whose expectations they had to satisfy, they were also obliged to deal with suppliers (of skills in this case) whose economic apparent economic benefit outweighed the ancillary costs in terms of team cohesion and founder status. She&#x27;s pointing this out as an example of systematic discrimination - not in the casual but incorrect sense that most people use the term, involving some villainous type whose primary goal is to disenfranchise others, but as an unfortunate consequence of the laws of supply and demand.<p>If you need to hire a hotshot in some specialized field and the expected value of that person&#x27;s economic contribution is greater than the cost of buying out a cofounder, then said cofounder is at the mercy of any personal biases that the hotshot might have. And being a hotshot is absolutely not correlated with any kind of superior moral development.

They have warped and corrupted their production workflow into using Microsoft Word .doc files as their raw substrate, even though this is a file format ill-suited for editorial or typesetting chores. And they expect me to integrate myself into a Word-centric workflow, even though it&#x27;s an inappropriate, damaging, and laborious tool for the job. It is, quite simply, unavoidable.

Notably, the government is also arguing that no one other than the company that provided the informationincluding the defendant in this casehas the right to challenge this disclosure in court.&quot;<p>... and here&#x27;s the paragraph of the opposition document that they are quoting:<p>&quot;(U) Third, Moalin lacks standing to assert the interests of and service provider, or the interests of other persons whose telephony metadata may have been collected along with his own, regardless of the collection&#x27;s scope.  Fourth Amendment rights are &quot;personal in nature, and cannot bestow vicarious protection on those who do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place to be searched.&quot; Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 219 (1981); accord Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 88 (1998) (a person claiming Fourth Amendment protection &quot;must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched&quot;).  Accordingly, &quot;a court may not exclude evidence under the Fourth Amendment unless it finds that an unlawful search or seizure violated the defendant&#x27;s own constitutional rights.&quot;  United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 731-32 (1980); see also In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 827 F.2d 301, 305 (8th Cir. 1987) (rejecting argument that a subpoena was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it &quot;may make available to the grand jury [money transfer] records involving hundreds of innocent people&quot;); United States v. Rigmaiden, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65633, at 38 (D. Ariz. May 8, 2013) (United States did not violate defendant&#x27;s Fourth Amendment rights by acquiring 1.8 million IP addresses from Verizon); Li, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at 17 (because the court concluded that the defendant lacked any reasonable expectation of privacy in the evidence obtained from the third-party service provider, &quot;the court also finds that defendant does not have standing to seek suppression of the evidence&quot;).

Most foreigners are concentrated in a few areas, and it tends to be mostly anecdotal. It does help you to avoid having misconceptions for things that cannot be easily measured, though (this was especially striking during the march 2011 tsunami and Fukushima events).<p>As mentioned by others, trade surplus or worse currency ""power"" are about as meaningless as you can be. Those are related to typical misconceptions and bias (mercantilism, etc...). About one year ago, there was a much more convincing article about the Japan myth: <a href=""http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/gros18/English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/gros18/English</a>.

In future new employees just read that documentation, and maybe do a bit of shadowing of existing employees.<p>Unfortunately, that's not what happens.  What happens is that Bob has a job, but Charles (Bob's boss) writes a bunch of stuff that he thinks Bob should be doing.  And he doesn't write sentences like ""Set the machine for 190 degree Celsius.  Place widgets in machine when it's at temperature.  Leave widgets in machine for four hours."" but he writes abstract ambiguous business speak that people can't use to actually do the job.  Then Edwin (Charles's boss) adds another bunch of stuff.  Then that gets edited into a god-awful mish-mash.  The people who did the software (with the ""help"" of Edwin) add some stuff about information.  Bob gets to work to an impenetrable document that bears little relation to his actual work flow.",1324817166

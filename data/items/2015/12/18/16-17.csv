10759438,comment,10759356,10759356,0,0,makecheck,,,"These days, there are a few things I would prefer to see from Boost...<p>1. A &quot;mini-boost&quot; that splits off some <i>very</i> basic things like string algorithms that are still not in the standard, while specifically excluding the heavyweight components.<p>2. Formal deprecation and eventual removal of some components, as C++ standards are finally getting their act together.  For instance, no new code should probably depend on BOOST_FOREACH(), and I would think that the main issue with objects like boost::scoped_ptr<> is the dependency on boost names (but functionally, they ought to work when replaced by standard versions now).<p>3. Merging of standard components and boost extensions.  For instance, if there is anything that boost::foobar does better than std::foobar, keep boost::foobar but migrate the implementation to be in terms of std::foobar (with new behavior on top) so that boost-extended code can integrate more cleanly with code that uses standards only.",1450457945

I always felt like I was making reasonable-to-good base salary at startups with the potential to hit it big with stock options.<p>Starting my job as a regular IC at big tech company was immediately an eye opener. Out of the gate my base salary was 10% higher than I made as a manager at my most recent startup. With bonus and publicly traded stock value after a year, I was making ~50% more and stock becoming even more valuable over time.<p>My first startup was great as I went in at 25 with no college and only self taught tech skills. In hindsight, this was a great (probably only) way to start but pivoting to big tech would have been a better move instead of trying to strike it rich at a startup.",1450457931

I <i>advocate</i> for a T shape in skills, but before you pick what you go deep in, get somewhat established in the wide. Fresh out of school you just can&#x27;t have the width yet to know what you want to and should go deep in yet, not even if you&#x27;ve had a job the whole time.<p>Actually, I suppose I ought to raise that up as my true point: Go a bit wide before you select what to go deep in. Try not to just float into something without thought. Width should emphasize learning things that have demonstrated staying power, but you want to go deep on something that you expect has future power. It probably shouldn&#x27;t be the current hottest fad tech, but the current hottest fad tech is probably at least in the area of a good future choice; it&#x27;s more interesting <i>why</i> the current fad is a fad than the specific fad. If you do go for something that became super hot in the last 6 months to a year, try to figure out how to leverage that into learning about fundamentals even so. There&#x27;s ways at both big companies and startups to succeed and fail by this metric.<p>Of course, on the flip side, you don&#x27;t have to get it perfectly correct. You can&#x27;t go deep in everything all the time, but &quot;pi-shaped&quot; Î  is feasible in addition to T-shaped too.

Looking at your later post (which for some reason I can&#x27;t respond to directly): so the derivatives are just what amplified the MBS crash with leverage -- allowed organizations to put more money into toxic MBS assets than they would normally be able to with cash?  All the splitting and recombining of MBS does that not act as a vehicle for laundering or coverup?  I mean it wasn&#x27;t technically laundering because it was completely legal to offer mortgages to people who couldn&#x27;t afford them.  But didn&#x27;t the MBS allow banks to resell those poor assets which normally wouldn&#x27;t have been sought after as investments?  And the investments were leveraged through derivatives so that crashing of the poor quality assets were amplified?  So it seems that there was a complex interaction of unregulated financial vehicles that caused the crisis and not simply &quot;bad mortgages&quot; or simply &quot;derivatives&quot; or simply &quot;MBS&quot;.  Any one of those alone would not have caused a huge bubble and crash, right?  I do not have a background in finance, but I think it is important for a layperson to understand what happened.",1450457143

I have to make a choice, there is no non-colored toy.<p>This is where knowing how these associations came into being could also help you and also help educate others (including your young niece). Several decades ago, the colors promoted were blue for girls and pink for boys. Today people would be surprised to know this, but what&#x27;s important is realizing that this was all created by a group of people saying &quot;this color is what is appropriate for this gender because...(prejudices)&quot;, which basically sounds ridiculous.<p>Here&#x27;s an excerpt from an article [0] on Jezebel (I found it by searching for &quot;girls blue boys pink&quot;):<p>> From Smithsonian.com:<p>> Ladies&#x27; Home Journal article in June 1918 said, &quot;The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.&quot; Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.<p>> In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene&#x27;s told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best & Co. in New York City, Halle&#x27;s in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.<p>----------<p>Here&#x27;s an excerpt from a similar article [1] from BBC that explains that there are no gender specific differences in babies/kids and that in adults blue is the most preferred by men and women:<p>> Various studies have looked at colour preferences in different age groups. In the US most have found that babies and toddlers, whether male or female, are attracted to primary colours such as red and blue. Pink doesnât feature high on the list, although it is more popular than brown and grey.  Some studies of this age group have found blue is favoured, others red, but they rarely find any gender difference.<p>> In 2007, research conducted at Newcastle University in the UK asked adults for their favourite colour. Did most of the women choose pink, or even red? No. The colour which came out top, for both men and women, was blue.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://jezebel.com/5790638/the-history-of-pink-for-girls-blue-for-boys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jezebel.com/5790638/the-history-of-pink-for-girls-blu...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141117-the-pink-vs-blue-gender-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141117-the-pink-vs-blue-ge...</a>",1450456528

For example, having local type inference makes it impossible to share a syntax between functions and variables, plus the process of &#x27;inferring&#x27; these types simply involves looking up the type of the expression by looking at the functions/values/operators used (which already have a known type at that point). With global type inference, looking at a term alone will not give you all the information that you need because there&#x27;s no annotated information about what the types of arguments to your function will be. The difference means that local type inference is just taking information from the right side and placing it on the left, while global inference is a recursive process of unifying information that is not necessarily connected in a clear way.",1450455832

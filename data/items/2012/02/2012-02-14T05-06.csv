3588859,comment,3588523,3588704,4,0,philwelch,,,"American football actually evolved from rugby, which was always more or less separate from soccer. Though basketball was probably more influenced by soccer.<p>MLS is growing fast in most of the metropolitan areas that have it, average attendances for MLS exceed those of the NBA, and TV ratings for the UEFA Champions League final last year almost doubled over the year before.",1329199151
3588858,comment,3588523,3588683,5,0,imjk,,,"The authors cover this twice. Once when they briefly mention soccer, may perhaps, take more prominence among Americans, and much more thoroughly, when they posit that the collapse of football would most benefit basketball, as it would be the next substitute.<p>But regardless, their points about the potential resulting benefits outside of the sporting world still has merit in my eyes.  For example, there are large universities that derive much of their funding and student enrollment based heavily on the marketability of their football programs. Schools like Ohio State, Oklahoma, Alabama, and LSU come to mind. Without the marketing strength of their football teams, perhaps the schools would be forced to put more effort into enhancing and promoting academic achievement.",1329199129

I don't know enough about Firefox's dev tools work to say whether or not it even makes sense to make use of firebug's code base and whether or not that sort of thing will happen in the future. It would be a huge failure if the firefox devs couldn't even manage to match the functionality of firebug, but it's more than a little too early to say that that will be the case.<p>As to the development team, there's a difference between surviving and thriving. Especially as the pace of firefox development has been accelerating I think bringing dev tool support in house is the only rational choice.",1329199118

It's definitely tightly ingrained in the culture down here, and not just for the lower classes-  game days are major social events for a large portion of the students and alumni.  Some people spend thousands of dollars a season to drive up every weekend, socialize with friends and family, grill out, and tailgate (more like a picnic, actually.)  Some of my friends' families don't bat an eyelash at dropping upwards of $500 a weekend if you add in the cost of tickets, gas, food, and alcohol.<p>I think the big draw of football, though, especially among low-income people, is that it's an accessible way for your average fan to engage in analysis without actually being responsible for failure.",1329199046

Kids are recruited from age 14 and get promised the moon by coaches/staff, spend 5 years getting banged up (concussions etc) for life, and most wind up scraping through with a useless degree if they graduate at all. A tiny percentage go pro and the rest are left out to dry with few career prospects having missed out on their education. Most pros don't make <i>that</i> much during their career and don't have great quality of life after it's over (run out of money, lack of marketable skills, head damage).<p>The big media companies love it, and heads of universities like the ""school spirit"" and brand appeal (even though most schools lose money on football). But for the players involved, it's basically a scam.

However, that's not how it's been enforced, and I don't see the admins using it to remove those things. The issue is ""borderline"" material that would take careful consideration as to whether or not it is pornographic.<p>As I touched on in another comment, I doubt a father posting an album of his vacation to /r/pics that happens to have his 12 and 16 year old daughters in swimsuits in it would be against this rule. However, someone posting an album filled with candid photographs of minors in swimwear at the beach would probably be removed, even if the person who posted it would not be prosecuted under US law.<p>If you feel that course of action is against this person's right, for whatever reason, that's fine. But please, do not think this is some slippery slope to a prude reddit. Just because the admins are removing what is at very best child erotica doesn't mean they're bending to the will of some overbearing ""Please, think of the children!"" mentality. The stuff removed was truly perverse and unsettling and brought nothing of value to the community.<p>If you wish to discuss this further, there exists [a subreddit][0] created by some of the very people who first initiated the removal of these subreddits that is open to discussion. You can find a handful of informative threads in there (and the sister subreddits) as to why [this wasn't some raid by Something Awful][1] and how some of the content posted [truly was child pornography][2]. You might have to wade through some heavy circlejerking, but if you're interested in why those subreddits were actually removed, that's a good place to start.<p>That was probably more than was necessary, but I'd like to use this as sort of a final comment on the subject. I'm <i>so</i> tired of arguing with people who feel the need to defend a person's right to post at best stolen pictures of underage children and at worst legitimate child pornography on the grounds that ""maybe some of the content wasn't totally illegal!"".

If the problem is that players receive a number of micro-shocks instead of a small number of concussion level ones, I could see a rule that a player can have no more than a given level of shock (with a formula that calculates intensity of the hits with quantity, kind of like how radiation exposure is measured).  After a certain level, a player would be required to be taken out of the game for the week/month/etc.  This could probably be implemented at the highschool and college levels fairly easily, but I'm sure that it would take quite a while to develop the formulas needed to determine a safe level of hits x severity of hits.",1329196258

But I loathed the fact that each subreddit sank into a lowest common denominator appeal as it grew: memes, linkbait-y headlines, groupthink. To be fair, these are problems with groups of people in general: they get dumber and dumber as they get bigger. But the total hands-off nature of Reddit meant that this sort of intellectual race to the bottom was not only inevitable, it was <i>expected</i> and allowed to happen, even if a vocal minority made their points coherently. They were drowned out by populist voices who are quick to decree that the voice of Everyone is worthwhile because, well, damn it, it's Everyone.<p>And that's bullshit.

It was expensive -- $900. But looking back on the decision a year and a half later, it was totally worth it. The back pain went away nearly overnight.<p>In other words: on this, don't cheap out. If you're looking for a chair that's going to be your primary work chair, you're going to be spending a significant chunk of your life sitting in it.

While the article casts this effect as one of VCs indirectly paying for stories and conflict of interest, I think personal ties are more important.

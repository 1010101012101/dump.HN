People like to believe in miracles, and b. Successful outlier cases that are contrary to common medical understanding keep cropping up -- the media loves them and people notice them. One more reason could be that many have experienced alternative treatments be fiercely dismissed by their physician, even when it can be surmised that the dismiss-er is probably fairly ignorant on the particular topic -- it turns people off.

Microsoft pays people to make sure it works on Windows and browbeat manufacturers to make it work and they program around it on every platform where it doesn't work.<p>In the 2.6.38 kernel a change was comitted into the mainline sources which chose 'probably works' over 'randomly hangs.'

2700696,comment,2700295,2700295,7,0,pash,,,"One wonders whether most mathematicians and physicists reject the author's point of view because to accept it requires either (1) a deep understanding of set theory and its limitations or (2) an attitude towards truth that's rather more cavalier than you'll usually find in the faculty lounge.<p>I suspect that the author himself fails (1) and so must believe what he does due to (2). I will not pretend to understand the details or even the general background of all the concepts needed to get at the heart of the issue, but I will single out one example to illustrate what I mean (hopefully).<p>The author credits synthetic differential geometry [1] as an intuitionistic-logical basis for infinitesimals (because of its rejection of the principal of the excluded middle) and in the next sentence calls Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis a theory based in ""classical logic"".  Now, this must seem perfectly reasonable to anyone who has sweated through Robinson's process of constructing the hyperreals [2]. But the author seems unaware of Edward Nelson's alternative approach, called internal set theory [3], which takes an axiomatic approach.<p>Nelson (who, by the way, is one of those ultrafinists whose existence the author questions in his second paragraph) simply adds a few axioms to Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and calls it a day [4].  He can do this because those axioms <i>must</i> be consistent if ZFC itself is consistent.  Which seems unobjectionable enough, if you're not a mathematician; but if you are, you probably don't like playing with axioms.  (As Bertrand Russell wrote, ""The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil."" He then rejects that approach, unlike Nelson, who admirably pilfers what he needs and proceeds to take a nap.)<p>And then you <i>also</i> probably don't like being reminded that ZFC's consistency (or not) is unprovable [5]. You see, Nelson's axiomatic construction of the hyperreals relies on the very same logical rabbit-hole as the author's intuitionistic logic: some things are neither provable nor disprovable in mathematics (or logic generally).<p>And that's why I say accepting the author's point of view requires either (1), if you realize that math is on shaky ground from the start, or (2), if don't much care and just want to get to the answer as quickly as possible (which is why I love Nelson's approach to infintesimals).<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_differential_geometry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_differential_geometry</a><p>2. <a href=""http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/analysis_hyperreals.html#construction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/analysis_hyperreals.html#co...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_set_theory</a><p>4.

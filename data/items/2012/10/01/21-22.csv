I've had great difficulties in the past with Cygwin DLL's, particularly when a program comes with its own Cygwin DLL which is a different version than the system Cygwin.<p>I haven't used Cygwin since 2005 or so due to these difficulties.<p>For Windows virtualization solutions, my first stop these days would be Virtualbox, qemu or the like.  Second preference is mingw/msys.<p>I've also had a positive experience with a little-known solution called Colinux [1], essentially a Windows port of another little-known technology in the Linux mainline kernel called user-mode Linux.  Colinux requires some setup, especially if you want graphics (for GUI work, you need some remote desktop with a Windows client like Xming or VNC).  Again, I'd recommend VirtualBox or qemu for casual use, but Colinux is an interesting technology, and I've found it gets very good performance.<p>My negative experiences with Cygwin were so great, it is only something I use when there is no alternative available.  And in preference to all of these is simply using Linux, but sometimes that's simply not an acceptable alternative to Windows (i.e. when you're making a product that you want to run on all popular OS's, supporting only Linux seems like a recipe for disaster.  See Sage [2] for an example of an open-source project whose official line on Windows compatbility is ""use Virtualbox."")<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.colinux.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colinux.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://sagemath.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sagemath.org</a>",1349128710

If you compete on these dimensions you will have a very difficult time differentiating yourself -- there simply is not enough difference between one repo provider and another on these bases to matter. Cost of switching, I would imagine, is relatively easy -- `git remote add`, `git push`, and done?<p>There is also, perhaps, competition on UI/UX quality. This can be a differentiating factor for some, but I think not as strong as it is for other markets, given the strong technical background of the target market. If you had some original and compelling offer which had a poorer but workable UI (which improved rapidly over time), that could negate the advantage that e.g. Github has over you on interface.<p>I don't have any better ideas for this space -- the generic advice for you I would give is to innovate in some different, not-already-explored way.

In a similar situation, a better deal would have been to book a hotel rather than go through AirBnB. And that is the crux of my article. AirBnB is risky in a similar situation (travelling with family, travelling overseas etc.)<p>Next, the major issue and the failures were AirBnB's on multiple fronts:<p>1. Sending me the address wrong. I am not sure how this happened, but either the host deliberately provided the wrong address to AirBnB or something went wrong in the AirBnB's system.<p>2. Their support insisted that I wait for 5 hours or more for the host to be at the address. Otherwise they would charge me for the cancellation. Again, note that the address that they wanted me to go to was the wrong address (and no one knew at that point that that was the wrong address).<p>3. Asking me to follow up on the email rather than try and sort the situation over the phone.<p>Regards,\nVikram<p>I will individually reply to the comments if there is something specific that needs addressing.",1349126849

Every time you have a callback calling another callback, you have a lock and all the race condition/deadlock issues associated with that. Of course, writing an application that doesn't have complicated synchronization requirements (streaming fileserver) can often require less boilerplate in an evented system. However, you run into a catch-22 here: by definition it's an application with fewer synchronization requirements, so you'd have to use fewer complicated locks in a 'heavy thread' implementation as well :).<p>Ultimately it's an engineering tradeoff problem, and you have to weigh lightweight node-style cooperative multitasking with the ability of a traditional thread system to better handle highly complicated scenarios.<p>Or you can be Russ Cox and argue that this is a false dichotomy[1] and that we should all be using CSP.

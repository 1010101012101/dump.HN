A person who is good at programming quickly. Not everything a hacker produces is a hack. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; example: ""A SAIL hacker"". (Definitions 1 to 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6.

The threat of making documents public disrupts that paper trail, which causes mass ineficiency in an organization. ES: ""So it's exactly your point, so that in order to kill six million Jews, you actually have to write it down."" JA: ""It's a big logistical process""<p>- ""Fundamental justification [For Wikileaks] is that, there is really two. First of all, the human civilization, its good part, is based upon our full intellectual record, and our intellectual record should be as large as possible if humanity is to be as advanced as possible. The second is that in practice releasing information is positive to those engaged in acts that the public support and negative to those engaged in acts that the public does not support."" [Ok, I don't really buy this. Small groups are just as capable as large groups of harbouring secret plans that the public is opposed to. Secrecy is a double edged sword for both those in power and those outside of it.]<p>- If you support these ideas, you should ""give money to WikiLeaks [Laughter]"". But seriously.<p>- ""Courage is not the absence of fear. Only fools have no fear. Rather courage is the intellectual mastery of fear by understanding the true risks and opportunities of the situation""<p>- ""because we all only live once, we all suffer the continuous risk of not having lived our life well. Every year. Every year that is not used is 100% wasted, it's not a risk of that, it is a dead bet""<p>- Assange's response to accusations that wikileaks causes harm, is interesting. See: ""Up until Collateral Murder""<p>- Interesting aside about the purpose of the Pentagon's posturing, see: ""WikiLeaks became the status quo""<p>- A great story straight from Firefly, episode ""Our Dear Mrs. Reynolds"" See dialogue after: ""The woman from Catalonia""<p>- Leading through values instead of through command and control allows an organization like WikiLeaks to be better protected against two types of organizational attacks: infiltration and getting members plucked off (scared away?). This creates a P2P network of people instead of a classic client/server hierarchy.<p>- Wikileaks does premature redactions not because there is a ""risk of producing harm as a result of disclosure"", but because ""there is a probable risk that if we don't engage in that sort of behaviour, our opponents will opportunistically attempt to distract from the revelations that we have published."" Once again goes back to ""controlling the story"" conversations they had earlier. Interestingly, Assange failed to control the story w.r.t. rape allegations, and that is now what he and wikileaks is known for. Resulting discussion on the slippery slope of redaction is interesting. Assange would ideally like the source of the material to provide the redactions.<p>- ""If it is true information we don't care where it comes from. Let people fight with the truth, and when the bodies are cleared there will be bullets of truth everywhere, that's fine""<p>- Lisa asks ""How do you know if you've won?"" JA: ""... [insightful comments snipped]...I think we can make some significant advances and it is perhaps, it is the making of these advances and being involved in that struggle that is good for people. So the process is in part the end game. It's not just to get somewhere in the end, rather this process of people feeling that it is worthwhile to be involved in that sort of struggle, is in fact worthwhile for people.""<p>There's a lot to think about here.

For example, GPUs are specialized for the task of 3D math, but their particular purpose is decided by the CPU. Similarly, FPGAs can be dynamically programmed for a special circuit. Neither is ideal, but in hindsight I would have liked to see something similar develop for the task of routing - and the economic pressure applied by not buying ASICs (that break the stack seperation) would have helped (yes we have benefited from them, but we have benefited from taking a specific path - we don't know if there was a better one). Routing probably would have benefited from an earlier and stronger push towards multicore processors - only there was no reason to do it in consumer CPUs because we view routing and computing largely as exclusive domains (even though the Internet's success has come from connecting many general purpose endpoints... Why is the fabric not also general purpose?).<p>Going forward, I suspect GPUs could also be applied to make routing decisions with acceptable speeds.

What you can do is to easily write code over some sort of 'boxed' values, where the type of the box is given by type signatures, and more importantly is almost always quite clear from context.<p>In this case, think of Maybe as a box containing one or zero instances of a type. For Maybe<p><pre><code>    do x <- maybeAnInt
       y <- maybeAnotherInt
       return (x+y)

Lists are 'boxed' values containing any number of elements<p><pre><code>    do x <- [1,2]
       y <- [10,20]
       return (x+y)
</code></pre>
The monadic semantics for lists means this returns the sum of each combination of values, namely [11,21,12,22]. This is essentially like a database join, which is why a monadic structure was used for LINQ.<p>For Promises<p><pre><code>    do x <- intPromise
       y <- anotherIntPromise
       return (x+y)
</code></pre>
This returns a new promise containing the sum of the result of two promises instead of using callbacks.<p>Essentially all these types live in a Maybe/List/Promise box. There are many more examples. The nice thing about monads is that the semantics of how these things work is abstract enough to allow a variety of interpretations, but constrained enough (by the Monad laws) that you get a nice intuition of how things work after using a few different instances.",1366413381

And I think that's sort of what you're getting at by advocating open allocation and profit sharing.<p>Either that, or we need to at least strengthen the welfare state enough to decouple employment from basic livelihood, so that business failure doesn't impose the risk of homelessness/starvation, and most people aren't compelled to become MacLeod Losers, selling all their economic upside risk off in exchange for stable shelter, food, and medical care.",1366413028

5579114,comment,5578642,5578642,128,0,a_p,,,"Steve Jobs was not a ""hacker"". [] He knew almost nothing about computer languages, computer architecture, and according to Neil Young, he listened to vinyl records at home [1]  which shows that he was ignorant of how audio quality works (see [2]). Steve did not contribute any original ideas or any important technological innovations. He claimed during his Stanford commencement speech that if Macintosh had not included eye pleasing typography, then computers would never have had typographically pleasing typefaces (because ""Microsoft just copied Apple); this is ludicrous. In fact, Apple's software patents for digital typography added unnecessary difficulties. [3] Many people are unhappy about Apple culture of paranoia, litigation, and features that restrict user's freedoms that Steve created.<p>Steve is known for having a great sense of design, but it seems that he only had taste in choosing among the good designs of others. Just look at the yacht he designed without Jonathan Ive's collaboration. [4]<p>Many of you may say that I'm missing the point; that his ability to convince others of what was important and his ""vision"" is what made him great. My contention is that he appropriated other people's original ideas, and other people implemented his modifications. I'll admit that directing such efforts is not an easy thing to do, and most breakthroughs are improvements upon others' ideas. But it is very rare for the original creators to be alive and ignored while the modifier is celebrated with maudlin elegies.<p>EDIT: The media's treatment of his death, President Obama's statement that he was a great ""inventor"", etc. was not his fault. But I think that when the deaths of people like Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy in the same month as Steve are ignored, then the world is suffering from a serious case of myopia. Ignoring Dennis and John while celebrating Steve is like fawning over the interior decorator with praise about the warmth of a house while ignoring the carpenter and contractor.<p>Perhaps I should add that I am being critical of Steve because of an abundance of articles that did not focus on what he actually contributed, or criticized only his behavior towards others. Steve did seem to be able to hire, attract, or motivate as many talented engineers as he did drive away. This is a very hard thing for a CEO to do, and he deserves a large amount of credit for doing this. The talent that he helped attract and the products they create are responsible for Apple's stock price rise and continued profitability since his death.<p>[] <a href=""http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html</a>

5579110,comment,5578195,5578609,1,0,frugalfirbolg,,,"Let's say that each programmer is responsible for a programming club at a public school. Reasonably the club would meet 3 times a week, and would be 2 hours per session.  Homework would be assigned, which would need to be 'graded', so you could easily expect 10 - 15 hours a week for the teaching commitment.<p>Now, how many students would you be able to handle per mentor? I agree that teaching is part of leadership, but few team leaders have had to teach a 100 people at the same time. Maybe 30 per mentor?<p>Of course, after a year or two the senior students could help as mentors.<p>Who would join? Since it's a club, students will expect it to be fun. Granted, there are sports, band, cheerleading, etc where it is accepted that there will be hard work involved. They each have some kind of payoff, like games and concerts. I guess the club would be broken down into coaching and development sessions to teach skills, and then projects to develop them. You would want the projects to be something that the students could show the rest of the school, like a website or toy app. It would need to be small enough to be completed during a semester and could be done with the help of the art or A/V club.<p>How will a professional programmer feel about all of this? Yes, it is rewarding to teach, but at the same time you would be working with teenagers with varying levels of commitment. You're selecting for a very special type of person now, that is a programmer with vision, leadership skills, and that actually enjoys being around young adults.<p>I could see this working with small groups: 5 to 10 highly motivated students that already know the basics of programming hacking together apps with the help of a mentor. For those who don't know how to program yet, maybe work with the local colleges to open up programming courses similar to Vocational programs or Post Secondary Education Opportunities to learn the basics and earn college credit while still in high school.",1366412732

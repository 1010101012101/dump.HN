Why waste all this effort fretting over a 1% chance that we can't really change or prepare for, when we should be paying attention to the 99% likelihood that we will need to keep working in the existing economic framework.<p>Sure, it's ridiculous to argue that the economy will always be fine because it always has been, but it's equally silly to say that just because the current situation is new and confusing (and maybe even scary) that we should all quit our jobs, buy land in Montana, and stock up on guns to fight off bandits.<p>All this economic doomsday talk over the credit crunch is starting to sound like Y2K all over again.",1198705302

92788,story,,,1,4,aa_aa,"storage for user-generated media?",,"I'm curious: How are startups here managing their storage needs, especially when it comes to storing multiple MG and even GB of photos, videos, and other media per user?<p>Amazon S3 seems to be the ""in"" solution right now, but when you do the math, it gets pretty expensive as you start nearing multiple TB of storage.  Managing your own NAS at a colocated facility seems like it would be cheaper, but then you have all the additional admin overhead of colocating.<p>Has anyone found a good VPS or dedicated server provider that offers lots of storage and bandwidth at reasonable rates?  Or is colocation pretty much the way to go?  Other options?",1198704447

This seems particularly useful where you want to be able to quote images/diagrams from a page, tables, etc. In terms of text, it is not particularly useful unless the text provides a specific context for the images being ""quoted"". On the whole, very cool.<p>Otherwise, is the logo meant to look like a bbcode, ie: that capturing a screen shot is as easy as using bbcode? Or am I digging too deep into this?",1198704132

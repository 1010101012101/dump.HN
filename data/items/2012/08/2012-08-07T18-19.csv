4351667,comment,4350424,4351493,16,0,soegaard,,,"Scheme is so old that there is not one language but rather a family of dialects that are considered Schemes. The Scheme community has several times made a standard on the parts of the language(s) that various implementors can agree on. The standard is small though. All the major Scheme implementations come with <i>many</i> language constructs and libraries not covered by the standard.<p>Racket started as a Scheme but changed name to Racket a few years ago to signal that the racket language is <i>much</i> more than plain standard Scheme. One remarkable thing about Racket is the that the module system allows implementing other languages as modules with relative ease. Included in the Racket distribution is therefore an implementation of R6RS (and R5RS) the most recent standard (R7RS is coming soon).<p>Also included is implementation is a typed version of Racket, an implementation of a logic programming language and, yes your eyes are not deceiving you, Algol 60.",1344365989

This was also the same argument when XP came out. I remember the slashdot kiddies saying ""Its Win2000 with fisher price colors! Mandrake will be the new desktop."" Err, okay.  I love FOSS, but the idea that Joe Sixpack is switching to Ubuntu because the start button is missing is a little overblown.<p>I'm begining to feel sorry for MS's Windows product. Its a damned if you/damned if you don't scenario. If they don't innovate and do something different then they'll be criticized for being stale.  When they do innovate they're criticized for confusing users and not sticking with the same tired WIMP formula.<p>I get it, these critics are biased, but lets at least wait until the RTM gets in the hands of users before we call it a disaster. It might very well work out for MS.  Win8 went from a joke on these forums to a brave OS after the MS surface announcement.  Public opinion is quite fickle isn't it?",1344365973

I always assumed that the lack of E was so that there would be no confusion with the ESNU system (which a number of students used to have in elementary school, but then they switch over to the A-F system in middle school). Also, many countries outside the U.S., including non-english speaking ones, use the  A-F system.

This is like being able to open the source code other people's programs to see how things work, debug your experiment and is the analogue of an oscilloscope in electronics.<p>While sequencing is incredibly useful for some applications (I spend my time working on Illumina current-generation ""Next-gen"" sequencing), we don't understand nearly enough about the regulation of genes for a sequencer to be analogous to an oscilloscope.  It is, at best, a wiring diagram, and really much closer to a parts list.  Oxford Nanopore seems really exciting, especially for field biologists, but it's at best 1 order of magnitude better (in terms of cost, speed, and sensitivity) than current technology; historical trends have seen a Moore's law-style exponential increase in capabilities, though, so Oxford Nanopore isn't really a quantum leap.",1344365683

I decided to focus on HTML-5 technologies and a niche focus on audio based applications as a catalyst to learn and have fun. I will tell you this, the few opportunities that I've had have come out of having little projects visible online for people to ""see"". Having ""real"" projects up and viewable is an absolutely huge differentiator, and here's the kicker, they don't have to be that ""good"", they just have to demonstrate competence and ability.

The sites block IPs, but then fraudsters go through an internet cafe or proxy. Sites shut down one account, and the fraudsters rent a bot net and run scripts to create a thousand more. It's a cat and mouse game.<p>Companies where payments are central (e.g., PayPal, Square) end up building some combination of machine learning, investigation tools, a dedicated operations team to review/verify suspicious transactions, and custom logic to look at all sorts of signals correlated with fraud.

They wont go to work in US anytime soon because their Indian employer doesnt need them move to US.

These candidates are not only engineers; they are IT workers (who cant code), teachers, accountants and nurses. Most of these candidates are not qualified enough, many have fake degrees and most cant speak even speak English.<p>Their visas are sponsored by their shell recruitment agencies in US (supported with fake documents). These candidates do not even have a real job offer yet; the recruitment agency produces a fake job offer and keeps them on their own payroll.
Upon approval of H1-B visa, these candidates arrive in US with no clue about what comes next. Their recruiters throw them in dorms with miserable living conditions. The recruitment agency trains them some English and Interview 101 and arranges several interviews in US companies.<p>The American companies contract these workers from the recruitment agents, usually at 50% of the market salary.

Or if your companies to lazy to train people then pay high enough salaries so these people go train themselves.  I think its fine to bring in a few extra smart immigrants to provide a different perspective but lets be reasonable, ordinary Americans built this country and they're the reason Silicon Valley exists in this country and not someplace else. If there's a lack of talent then I think CEOs should reinvest in ordinary Americans and not take these shortcuts.

4351349,comment,4347985,4349175,2,0,mirkules,,,"I heard about this hack too (<a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-four-critical-security-flaws-that-resulte"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-four-critical-security-flaws-...</a>), but I disagree with you - the last 4 CC digits should be considered non-identifying.<p>First, let me explain a little bit of background on this ""hack"". From the article, they had 4 problems with their process that allowed them to get hacked badly:<p>1. AT&T was tricked into redirecting my voicemail to a fraudulent voicemail box;<p>2. Google's account recovery process was tricked by the fraudulent voicemail box and left an account recovery PIN code that allowed my personal Gmail account to be reset;<p>3. A flaw in Google's Enterprise Apps account recovery process allowed the hacker to bypass two-factor authentication on my CloudFlare.com address; and<p>4. CloudFlare BCCing transactional emails to some administrative accounts allowed the hacker to reset the password of a customer once the hacker had gained access to the administrative email account.<p>I'm not really sure what #3 is and #4 is irrelevant to our discussion, so I'll concentrate on points #1 and #2.<p>From #1, it follows that the attackers were able to obtain the phone number associated with the two factor auth. How did this work? My assumption is that it was a very targeted attack.<p>The article starts the attack at June 1st, 2012, but I believe (read: assume) that the attackers probably met the target of the attack beforehand and obtained his/her business card (with a cellphone number), which allowed them to perform #1 above.<p>So, given that this attack required a physical piece of paper (i.e. a business card) to be acquired from the target, it is not a stretch of imagination to say that if another attacker wanted to obtain the last 4 digits of someone's credit card, all they need to do is follow the person to a restaurant or gas station and get a payment receipt -- every receipt has the last 4 digits written on it. Some have the first four.<p>Therefore, I don't believe it was Amazon's fault for assuming the last 4 digits are non-identifying, but rather Apple's fault for assuming they are. To be clear, hindsight is 20/20, so I think it was relatively reasonable for Apple to assume that. However, I do expect Apple to change this policy in the future.",1344362695

4351328,comment,4349859,4350337,1,0,fuzzythinker,,,"I disagree with your arcade death reason by the 2x price.  According to [1], arcades had started costing a $.25 USD since 1966.  By standard rate of inflation of ~3.4% [2], that means it should cost approximately $1.50 USD today.  One argument to this is rather the starting basis of $.25 is the right price.  According to the same source, the golden age of arcade is ~1980.  So for the sake of finding a lower optimal basis, let's assume that $.25 is the optimal pricing  in 1980.  Which means arcade games should cost ~$.75 to play today.  Now the question becomes rather games should accept coins other than quarters so the pricing isn't such a steep step function, or  game creators needed to start making games to justify 2x pricing.  I guess they decided on the latter.<p>So I totally disagree with this assessment.  I would say the consoles offering an alternative to arcade games at a reasonable price is the main reason.  Yes, I agree with you that it's a totally different experience, but maybe not enough to stop going to the arcades when one can play for ""free"" at home or friends' house.  This is the first step in killing the arcades.  The second step is the internet and portable gaming/mobile as an alternate pastime for kids.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game</a>

8582461,comment,8582096,8582319,0,0,adventured,,,"I think the price cutting / value proposition is beginning to finally outrun the needs that the extreme majority of sites might have. For most of the US Web, infrastructure demand is not growing, and neither is traffic (the principle that there are only so many hours to consume content, against a mostly maxed out user base). Your typical business web site, will never keep up with what Amazon is doing. So at some point in the next few years, Amazon will be both cheap enough and convenient, versus co-lo or dedicated.<p>In the last year I&#x27;ve noticed AWS is finally catching my eye on price, and I&#x27;m a big co-lo self-managed fan due to the cost savings. In a few more years I could see myself switching everything over and not feeling bad about the cost.<p>In that time Amazon&#x27;s value proposition will chase down toward where Linode and Digital Ocean are at today. Let&#x27;s say their system power (the sum of the hardware) will go up by 50% every year, while their prices fall 25% every year per 2014 defined unit of power. Even though I consider Amazon expensive today, it won&#x27;t be long at this point before they start to outstrip my scale of service demand (I&#x27;ll never be operating Twitter or Foursquare on AWS).",1415606272

Many of the most well-regarded Zen practitioners and teachers very much would have savaged it, EX:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku#Opposition_to_.22Do-nothing_Zen.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku#Opposition_to_.22D...</a><p>> &quot;One of Hakuin&#x27;s major concerns was the danger of what he called &quot;Do-nothing Zen&quot; teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, &quot;passing day after day in a state of seated sleep&quot;. Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil &quot;emptiness&quot; was enlightenment, were Hakuin&#x27;s constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of followers of the maverick Zen master Bankei. He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one&#x27;s ability to manifest it in all activities. He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.&quot;<p>Hakuin, who is pretty damn amazing and certainly lived an amazing life by almost anyone&#x27;s standards, wrote that after achieving some basic glimpses enlightenment, you ought to be out helping people and doing good things.<p>You&#x27;ll see that in non-priest Zen practitioners, too.

That it &quot;just works&quot; SHOULD be a given, but given that OneDrive is capped at 20,000 files and fails to upload from my desktop, I guess we shouldn&#x27;t take that for granted.<p>GDrive works fantastically well and offers great photo enhancement, but the price is the highest of anyone here. Particularly if they&#x27;re trying to develop G+ into a Facebook competitor, you&#x27;d think they would offer more-than-competitive pricing to encourage consumers to keep their photo libraries online and glean information about consumer movement patterns, personal networks, local attractions, and personal brand interests. Why roll out cool auto-awesome features if you&#x27;re going to price them out of the market?<p>OneDrive has the second best value behind Amazon Prime... in theory. In practice, OneDrive has a 20,000 file cap and again, the program simply won&#x27;t upload my files from my desktop. There&#x27;s no photo enhancement, sharing, or organization. I guess they&#x27;re relying on Office as the big draw. Which makes sense -- documents are an insignificant burden, allowing for steady revenue with few attached costs. And most people won&#x27;t understand that their photo libraries weren&#x27;t safely uploaded to the cloud as they expected.<p>Amazon&#x27;s Prime Photos is a GREAT value (and seems to work really well in uploading and organizing my photos), but I&#x27;m still unclear on whether Prime deduplicates my uploads or has excellent sharing/privacy controls like you can find on G+. Still, the photos feature makes Prime a must-buy even if the rest of Prime&#x27;s insane value didn&#x27;t already do that. The only catch is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer two-factor authentication... which is a big deal, Amazon!<p>- - - - -<p>Given that the company with the biggest consumer base can leverage their audience to build out the biggest, baddest infrastructure that subsequently takes advantage of marginal cost economics in the delivery of their own services or in the replacement of corporate IT... the race to the bottom makes perfect sense in the consumer sphere. You want the biggest consumer base to justify short-term expansion (and then finance that expansion in the long term with your locked-in customers).<p>This is only a race to the bottom if you assume that consumer storage is the end game of clouds. In ten years, the biggest clouds can theoretically provide services that replace most corporate IT... and even most personal computers, as seen in today&#x27;s thin-client Chromebooks. And if Microsoft lets Google beat Azure in this arena, not only will Google dominate in the field of cloud services, Google&#x27;s vast infrastructure could leverage economies of scale to deliver Google&#x27;s search/local/maps/whatever services vastly quicker and cheaper than Microsoft could.<p>Clouds are the modern-day railroads.

But an in-app purchase on an iPhone still charges the &#x27;card-not-present&#x27; rate.<p>Visa&#x27;s Jim McCarty&#x27;s response is, &quot;Fundamentally because the payload is different. One is a full EMV track read transaction and the other is not.&quot;<p>&quot;Because it&#x27;s a rule that y&#x27;all made?&quot;<p>&quot;No, because the data doesn&#x27;t flow.

The security properties are derived from the <i>user interaction points</i>. Specifically, Alice loads her card into Apple Pay by taking a picture of it. A week later Alice uses her phone to pay with Apple Pay and the merchant would get a card-present rate. <i>Can any other app do the same thing</i>? Is there an open standard which allows LevelUp (who currently is forced to pay card-not-present) to use the same exact steps and get the same favorable rate? If not, I think Cook has a very valid point.<p>Apple Pay wins by default if they are the only mobile app in town which can get a card-present rate. I assume Google Wallet is card-not-present, for example. Merchants won&#x27;t pay a higher rate so you can use some app. Jim McCarty specifically mentions the scale problem with changing brick & mortar merchants card-not-present rates.",1415603792

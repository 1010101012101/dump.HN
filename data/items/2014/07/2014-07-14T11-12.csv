I can only afford to keep a couple of backend servers running, so if a lot of people are submitting videos then the waiting time can be quite long...<p>Thanks for your time guys :)",1405339053

All the things described within are possible, but for this to all happen in eleven years, we would require a complete change of our systems of governance and economy, now - as neither of those are set up to engender any of the included.<p>Dementia declines - no.

Solar will  languish in 7th or so, even though the technology will be more than viable.<p>Type 1 diabetes is preventable - except it won&#x27;t be - because treatment is profitable.<p>Food shortages - yeah, no.

Why would the petrochemical industry give up a profitable product line? The only impetus to change would be a result of rising petrochemical prices - and all that&#x27;ll happen is consumers will end up paying more for packaging, as goods decrease in cost due to the prevalence of slave labour and machine labour in the manufacturing sector, and the net-net doesn&#x27;t vary.<p>Cancer treatments - for the very wealthy, yes. For the rest of us, same old, same old, pump you full of poison.<p>DNA mapping at birth - this one will happen. Not to manage disease risk, but to ensure that you are tracked for the rest of your life, and that your insurance premiums are appropriately higher depending on your luck in the genetic lottery. Hell, never mind insurance premiums, what jobs you can do, who you can have kids with, where you can live.<p>Teleportation - don&#x27;t make me laugh.

There are curriculum developers earning millions to created scripted lessons to turn teachers into deliverers of modules in alignment with the Common Core (or to replace teachers with computer software carefully designed for such alignment).

8030352,comment,8027361,8029235,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Go is designed to take advantage of large amounts of concurrency, while still providing good performance (think cloud).</i><p>Java/JVM and C#/.NET fall in that space as well and are doing a very good job, while at the same time exposing a managed runtime that can be used as a target for other languages, thus lowering the friction for bootstrapping such new languages. Because of this, in a sense, Java/.NET are better replacements for C, which has also been used for building portable libraries freely usable across multiple languages. I&#x27;m still getting thrills when using well tested, mature Java libraries from Scala, Clojure or JRuby.<p>Where Java/.NET really suck is for building real-time or soft real-time systems, because they are managed and thus heap allocation must be managed by a garbage collector. Go has precisely the same limitation by design, with the difference that because it&#x27;s younger, it doesn&#x27;t have pauseless garbage collectors available for it - like say, the one from Azul Systems. Go GC is even less good than the garbage collectors available in the reference Java/.NET implementation - the one in version 1.0 at least wasn&#x27;t even precise, let alone concurrent.<p>And this is not about <i>performance</i> per se, btw. This is about dealing with real-time constraints. In certain contexts speaking of the &quot;cloud&quot;, it&#x27;s not enough if your server is able to respond to tens of thousands of requests per second in under 100ms per request, if you can&#x27;t guarantee that kind of delivery for more than 99.99% of requests. For video decompression, another industry dominated by C/C++, the average throughput doesn&#x27;t matter if you can&#x27;t guarantee a consistent frame rate per second - how annoying would it be if when watching a video, the playback would suffer short freezes every couple of seconds? To make matters worse, if the GC stops the world, it can act like a global lock (GIL) and then you become aquatinted with Amdahl&#x27;s law, as it severely limits vertical scaling, even if your logic is embarrassingly parallelizable.<p>Go was referred to as a systems language, but I don&#x27;t think that was a mistake on their part. If Go wouldn&#x27;t have been referred as a systems language, then that would&#x27;ve meant admission that the real competition for Go is actually the JVM with all its languages running on top of it.",1405335882

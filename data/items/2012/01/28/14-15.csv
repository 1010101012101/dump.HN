There is such a large market that people are willing to commit copyright infringement.<p>D. Just because your business model doesn't adapt to the market, does not automatically mean that your business model deserves protection in the market.<p>E. Media content creators have long protected their international licensing agreements with anti-customer technology like DVD Regions.<p>F. At the end of the day, the customer doesn't care. They will find a better product in the market.<p>G. It's my experience that people who pirate out of this frustration, are happy to pay when it is available.

3522194,comment,3522014,3522014,1,0,Hemospectrum,,,"In markets where even a delayed rebroadcast is vanishingly unlikely, online streaming is absolutely thriving. For example, a whole lot of anime hits Crunchyroll and Hulu before the fansub groups ever get a crack at it. These sites and a few others are also expanding into live action Japanese and Korean TV.<p>However, I think this only works when there's very little competition (from broadcasters) for individual shows. The BBC is probably in the worst position possible for an attempt to move to this model due to interplay between company-wide policy and the negotiating power of its international counterparts. Previous agreements with cable companies can't help much either.",1327762710

I'll do a more in depth calculation.<p>2 seconds of uncompressed sound, at 44.1 kHz, in stereo and 8 bits per sample is 170 KiB. 17 images of on average 24 by 24 pixels at 32 bits per pixel is 68 KiB. Three other, bigger images give another 40 KiB of uncompressed data. A total ~280 KiB. There's a few KiB of HTML but I don't know whether and how I should count that.

For example, there's the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory that has several different abilities:<p><pre><code>  Crystallized Intelligence \n  Fluid Intelligence\n  Quantitative Reasoning\n  Reading & Writing Ability\n  Short-Term Memory\n  Long-Term Storage and Retrieval\n  Visual Processing\n  Auditory Processing\n  Processing Speed\n</code></pre>\nThis was cut and pasted from wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattell-Horn-Carroll_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattell-Horn-Carroll_theory</a>).  If you've taken an IQ test, you'll see that they test various types of cognitive abilities, not just math or logic, but also the ability to rotate objects in your head and visualize them.<p>I know plenty of people who are ""smart"" who have a very hard time with that.  In addition, I know plenty of people who aren't academically smart, but who are great visualizers.  There are many different components to cognitive ability.  I have a friend and both he and his father are exceedingly intelligent.  My friend's son also is also a gifted child.  However, when the son took some cognitive tests, his spacial/visualization scores were average, whereas the verbal and math were off the charts.  I don't think that affects whether or not the kid is smart, it's just interesting how cognitive ability is broken up into different measurable areas.<p>Is it so hard to imagine that computer programming takes a certain subset of cognitive ability that some people, who are considered smart, just don't have?  I know a lot of very intelligent people who wouldn't be able to program at all.  It's not because they're ""dumb"", but as I've said, but the way they process information is completely different.  You most definitely could develop the skills, however, if their brains are wired a certain way that causes them to be predisposed AGAINST programming, then they won't enjoy it very much at all.",1327762125

On top of that, you have to do it every time you want in and out of the case, on every call or event, every time.

I'm actually going to trust the guy who does it multiple times a day every day for years and years over the guy who insists the risk is greater than has ever been proven.<p>Either way, why should you care? I'm the one who will supposedly be paying for all these random dead components. I mean it hasn't happened once in years of being a field tech and never once using a strap and neither has it happened to anyone I know and the people I know are mostly techs and never use straps, but who knows what the future will bring?<p>> Inexplicable component failures; random errors weeks or even months down the road.

It's not that ""web programmers are doing something that's definitely not cool for our current RAM budget"". The javascript is loaded and probably jitted to a smaller space than its text (depends on the number of paths, etc - I'm ignoring lots of stuff here), the actual text passing through the wire is also pretty small. So where's the memory going? All the supporting stuff...<p>There's the whole javascript framework with it's own allocator, memory pools which will stay around for a long time. Some of the browser elements use the same kind of vm to actually display the UI to you, adding some more mem usage. Then there's the whole page which had to be read, parsed into a tree, processed to create appropriate model for display (all stages are preserved in an editable way). This has to be a live model for the whole time, since javascript might need to interact with it - you can't just flatten it into a screenshot and display that. Now the images - they also need to be loaded and decompressed for display. Also the text isn't that simple - there's the whole engine behind loading fonts, analysing each letter / pair / triple / ... for special spacing rules to be applied. There are multiple glyphs, font variants, sizes, etc. to rasterise. That text needs to be distributed properly inside of the DOM model generated above. That text flow actually affects the model again - they're linked, so they get processed again (text metrics need to be recomputed on each page resize, which may make some elements longer/shorter). Then the theme goes on top of this - since the application displays itself, the needed libraries / theme elements will be loaded too. But of course not all browsers use the theme from OS for displaying the form elements, so another layer needs to be loaded here. .... I could go on forever about elements which are needed for rendering the page.<p>So yes - lots of that could be much lighter. Lots of that could be made into modules or pulled some levels higher to make them more general. Lots of that might be just a result of sloppy coding noone ever got to fix.<p>But just remember that what you're actually using is a system on top of a system on top of a system on top of... If you used gopher on a real 80x25 term you'd use kilobytes. If you used first web browser with no image support and no scripting, you'd be under megabytes. But you don't - you're looking at a realtime rendering of 10 different models coming together and interacting with each other with next to no lag. And it all probably renders with hardware support to give you a very smooth scrolling experience. So no, web developers themselves have almost nothing to do with this whole mess. Unless they made a silly mistake and are leaking memory like crazy... they're not the ones to look at first.<p>(I simplified in many places, not all facts are relevant to every OS/browser combination, etc. just trying to make a point here)",1327761007

Afaik there is no performance hit in overwriting a flip-flop in memory that already has a value stored but there is a huge penalty for hitting a disk. So I'd be quite happy to have all my RAM utilized all the time if I have 0 swapping.<p>First of all if you are using a 64bit platform your pointers are going to be twice as big as they used to be but you get to access so much more memory that this issue solves itself.<p>Also IIRC Windows 7 does things like arrange your frequently used data into a contiguous area of the disk and then reads all that stuff into VM at bootup. This will result in higher RAM usage (due to many pages being loaded into physical RAM) but better overall performance since if other stuff needs the RAM more urgently it can either swap the cache back to disk or overwrite the cache entirely.<p>Let's say you have 8GB of RAM and are watching a HD video which is 7GB uncompressed and the rest of your system only really <i>needs</i> 1GB of your RAM, surely it makes sense what whilst you are watching the video you can use spare CPU cores to uncompress the rest of the video and put it into RAM.<p>I think it's more the case that computing will always expand to fill the amount of memory available.\nBearing in mind that even the cost of swapping is dramatically reducing with SSDs etc.",1327760377

There was one week where they showed a combined 96 hours of ""ground force"", ""changing rooms"" and one other insipid home reality show.  <i>96 hours</i> of repeats of just 3 shows.  Meanwhile EastEnders was scaled back and they showed less of that, and kept falling further behind.

3522079,comment,3521735,3521735,2,0,cletus,,,"I'm actually surprised by this. I've never liked the extra hardware buttons: they're in different orders on different phones, developers use them inconsistently and (IMHO) they lead to an inconsistent experience (eg in a browser you press the ""back"" hardware button to go back but a ""soft"" button to go forwards). Oh and discovery is more difficult (eg compare the iOS Settings app vs Menu -> Settings).<p>That all being said, I see ICS as a watershed moment for Android. I personally still prefer iOS but with ICS (at least with the native Google experience rather than the crapware layers most handset makers put over it) I think it's reached a point where I think it's a reasonable choice for, say, (non-techie) friends and family.<p>This all reminds me of the mouse a little. The Mac famously persevered with one buttons but the Windows two button mouse clearly won (even OSX has context menus). Even so, I have a hard time explaining to people about right-clicking so it's problematic. On iOS at least I think the single button is just fine, even preferable, and certainly far easier to understand and more consistent.",1327759486

Companies don't necessarily know your value and can't usually tell just from your resume. So when you are so far apart, you are suggesting the company just sucks. It could be that they just don't know what you're worth.<p>Bottomline: If a company has $70,000 set aside for the position, if you ask for $120,000 before they tell you the $70,000, you have a better shot than after they have shared and <i>associated</i> $70,000 with you.",1327759473
3522077,comment,3521903,3521903,10,0,barrkel,,,"This also depends on the nature of the organization you're negotiating with. The people first asking about your current salary / expectations of salary in a larger organization will often be from HR, collecting information that they'll feed up the organization, probably your boss-to-be's boss. The higher up this goes, the harder the heads are at negotiation; frequently, your boss-to-be, at the salary negotiation level, is just a go-between. He'll have an expected budget, but to push higher he'll have to go to his own boss, and that dynamic favours the company rather than the employee.<p>You need to balance the risk of getting off on the wrong foot, with the potential that you can be leaving a <i>lot</i> of money on the table - I mean, on the order of quarter of a million to half a million dollars over the course of your stay with that company is quite likely if you don't negotiate well - not to mention a bitterness that can grow over time. And switching jobs may not even be a cure here; if it's a job you enjoy, it's not much fun having to leave it in order to get your worth on the market. It's best to get both.",1327759472

They get hyped up in to 'negotiations' and start panicing if they can't get what they want/need.<p>It's less so in the IT world right now, but in most other fields, there's much higher unemployment.  People don't ""just walk away"", and often accept a situation that doesn't fit their wants/needs, because <i>needing</i> income ends up trumping everything else.<p>For someone not in IT right now, who needed a job, they're at a strong disadvantage because of the information imbalance during interviews.  Congrats on you being a rather rare individual who actually does what is recommended (walk away) - most people don't.  And it comes back to not being able to tell if the other side is lying.  And in some cases, being desperate enough to work for/with someone who they suspect or know is lying, but needing the job bad enough.",1327759461

The article itself is rather harsh as well, it flat out says ""there are those who can program, and those who cannot"". In my experience, the people who ""can"" program, almost always discover it on their own through their own curiosity.<p>For sure, someone may not discover programming until later in life and my anecdotal evidence can't possibly be all encompassing. But I do find if they haven't discovered programming on their own before taking their first CS course, that is very often a sign that they fall into the ""cannot program"" category that the article puts forward.<p>EDIT: even the fourth comment on Jeff's blog basically says what I said: ""When I was in college, I remember the students in my classes who had trouble were ones who were entirely new to programming. The rest of us had either been in programming classes previously or had been coding for fun since we were kids.""",1327759236

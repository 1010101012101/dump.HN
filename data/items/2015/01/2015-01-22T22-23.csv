I was sceptical about watching a command-line narrative, but this was incredibly well executed, with episode transcript and mini-reviews of related sites.  As the episode started, the speech pattern was so slow I wondered if it was a TTS robot aimed at non-English listeners, but then the voice quickly picked up speed to reach excited-hacker cadence.<p>How long does it take to write and produce each episode?  Would you care to share the toolchain being used for screencasts?<p>I miss the lost promise of SMIL which would have allowed in-context video links to URLs for related sites, or deep-linking to related video snippets in other episodes.  If your project continues, you will quickly grow a library which will benefit from cross-indexing. You will also find that a subset of content will need to be refreshed, as tools and environments change.  Metadata for modular snippets will improve discovery, reuse and update.<p>Rails Tutorial has generated six-figure revenue from screencasts combined with an ebook, so there is precedent for monetizing self-service video training.",1421967556

He wanted to be (the author argues) on the inside, a club of one, by turning traitor and giving secrets to the Soviets. The great paradox about him as the author explained was while he was betraying he erstwhile stood for, he was still a great fan of all these institutions he joined. Even in exile in Moscow he wore his school tie, he followed &#x27;his&#x27; cricket club, and he still seemed to think of his colleagues as friends.

    A room can be grue infested. A room is usually not grue infested.

    Every turn while the player is in a grue infested room:
        Increase the grue counter of the location by one.

    The dungeon is a room. &quot;You stand in a basic medieval dungeon.&quot; The dungeon is grue infested.

    The first time the player enters the dungeon:
        try looking;
        say &quot;It is dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.&quot;
    
    Grue lunch is a scene. Grue lunch begins when the grue counter of the dungeon is greater than 10.
    When grue lunch begins:
        	say &quot;A large, smelly, foul tempered creature resembling a cross between a troll and an orc lumbers out from one of the open passageways. It sniffs the air, catches your scent, and looses a mighty roar! Before you are able to do anything else, it quickly lunges forward, chomping down on your head with a sickening [bold type]*crunch*&quot;	;
	end the story saying &quot;You have been eaten by a grue.&quot;

If you have never been to Colorado, visiting during the wintertime is a great way to make lifelong memories in the Mile High State. One of the most thrilling activities you and your family can enjoy is Colorado snowmobiling. For those who have never explored mountainous back country, snowmobile tours in Vail is the perfect way to do so. Stay in the quiet little town of Red Cliff, nestled in the high Rockies while you enjoy the unique experience. If this is your first time engaging in a winter activity check out a winter sporting goods store for the right gear – snowsuits and goggles are essential when snowmobiling. If this is your first time snowmobiling do not worry; experts at your Vail snowmobile rental company will brief you on safety. ",,1421966990

Too often discussion gets reduced to a slogan like &quot;OOP allows reuse&quot; or &quot;typesafe programs can&#x27;t go wrong&quot; and then practice is enforced across entire companies without real reasons - just a lot of hand-waving, shaming and appeals to experience and authority which eventually harden into dogma.

So all the customer emails, phones, addresses, birth dates (and, I&#x27;m guessing, in the US SSNs) routinely fly around in Excel files called something like &quot;Order Metadata Report&quot; and sent to 50 people in 5 departments each of whom has their own use for it (like counting customers). Judging by the Sony hack it&#x27;s not just SMEs.<p>If you want to steal data from a company, just pay a student a few hundred bucks to take up an unpaid internship in marketing (particularly anything to do with emails or customer segmentation) and give him a USB key and teach him some VBA and basic SQL (making him useful for reporting). The interns always end up running the reports so have a lot of access, usually complete access - financial information is the only thing that&#x27;s not shared around. More advanced companies have a shared database access built into the excel files with a single login for everybody which never changes (hello 300 angry users) so with a copy of this file, you have perpetual up to date information long after you&#x27;re gone.<p>Then you try to stop them from doing this and the C-level folks will say something like &quot;it&#x27;s OK just this time&quot; and &quot;please stop slowing us down&quot;.

Once again 6 months later they start to form 2-word sentences (big bubble, my ball, mama ball, ball up etc.).<p>It seems that babies are already able to reason about the world in a rather complex way, for example the baby can already think that someone has the ball, but they can only express it using their limited vocabulary (mama ball etc.). It seems unlikely to me that once the baby can express the subject–object–verb sentence &quot;mama has (the) ball&quot; the thought processes would suddenly be replaced by grammatical constructs.<p>It does seem, however, that grammar can be used as a tool to verify thought processes. It casts the thoughts in a mould, so to speak, and puts it on the examination table of our echoic memory with a capacity of about 5-20 seconds.

The soda-pop bottle is a trivial purchase, and is generally available among many other brands offering the same thing.

No matter if it is found in a bin among bottles from other brands, or within a section containing only bottles from one brand. Bottles are also discarded after use, so they are not identified individually, but merely as one of many copies. I have several bottles of soda pop, some Coke some Pepsi. The brand is still very relevant.<p>A shirt on the other hand is probably accompanied by an entire section of clothing for the same brand, and does not need individual identification.

I don&#x27;t remember if that was the actual term used in the article, but it was basically this idea that given a problem, you can incrementally come up with better solutions (e.g. add 9&#x27;s to the end of a number to make it bigger), or you can take a leap out of that box and come up with a new class of solutions that completely outdo the old way of doing things (e.g. Knuth&#x27;s arrow notation, busy beaver).<p>One could argue that the arms race between Prototype, Dojo, YUI etc from the last decade was a race of incremental solutions and one-upmanship, and jQuery largely stood out from the crowd by having extremely well thought out developer ergonomics.<p>I think that the ideas behind React/Mithril/Mercury (composability, unidirectionality, etc) are, as jQuery UX was at the time, a &quot;leap out of the box&quot; in the frameworks&#x27; arms race, but I feel that frameworks like tuxedo are again settling into the territory of being merely stabs at incremental improvements.<p>The main problem I see here is that it&#x27;s not particularly obvious what kind of problem this framework solves.

It&#x27;s probably easy to get too paranoid, and perhaps those people never end up launching a successful Onion site.<p>But just quickly, he should have compartmentalized. Zero need to have all that data decrypted while doing day-to-day admin. A throwaway machine with Tails or something would suffice for management. Then, add some physical security, such as smartcards with removal events set to destroy and then chain it to your neck. Or there&#x27;s little dongles that do proximity detection.<p>Then get some physical security so your RAM is never exposed. The commercial phreaking devices were said to have thermite, but something explosive might look too much like terrorism. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;d be out of the question to wire up a short-circuit to your RAM at single click, although that would look bad, versus something less obvious.<p>But really, this is apparently only because he messed up his server security so badly. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t have been there in person in the first place, right? It&#x27;s probably safe to assume that if you&#x27;re being physically targeted, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time living a normal life. If you have a bunker or something where you can definitively see all approaches and have many minutes in case of a raid, eh, maybe. But by that time, there&#x27;s probably some sort of correlation information or real-world bug going on, right?

8932068,comment,8930752,8931901,0,0,morley,,,"> Frameworks are most often a bad idea. Use libraries instead.<p>People say this a lot, and it makes me wonder if they&#x27;ve ever worked on a team working on the same codebase. And if they do, what secret sauce they&#x27;re drinking to not go insane.<p>In my experience, when people on a team use libraries at their whim, the coding styles diverge wildly from feature to feature. One person decides they&#x27;re going to write all their AJAX callbacks in an anonymous function; another likes to reference a function directly; another likes to both; and yet another uses promises.<p>And as soon as someone needs to fix someone else&#x27;s project, they do some combination of (a) getting wildly frustrated with this other coding style, (b) rewire their mental model to adapt to this new style, (c) spend a week rewriting it in their own style, (d) introduce a ton of bugs in the process, or (e) by some miracle, get it to work perfectly.<p>So to combat this, the team works out coding standards and a style guide. You must tab with two spaces! You must pass a real Javascript function to your callbacks! You must separate your state from your view!<p>And of course, once your style guide is big enough, lo and behold: you have your own hand-rolled framework. And hopefully it&#x27;s tight enough that everyone writes in the same style, but is still expressive, and is still simple enough for a new team member to learn quickly.<p>So if you&#x27;re just starting a codebase, it makes complete sense to pick a framework on the outset because people have already gone through that headache for you.",1421964203

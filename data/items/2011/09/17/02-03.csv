AND it says that this is no longer a problem for users who installed the update, issued several days ago! So yes, this is a very misleading headline.<p>Regarding the content of the security advisory, it specifically says THIS (although the WebDAV site details are there after quite a bit of digging around):<p>""The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate <i>rich text format file (.rtf), text file (.txt), or Word document (.doc) that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file.</i>  An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user.""",1316228376

I've yet to encounter a situation where I nuke my cache and don't have rollback packages available. It boils down to a management issue. If you are nuking your package cache, I assume you are smart enough to have determined your system is running correctly first. There are cases where you might still want to rollback after clearing your package cache, so there is ARM.<p>Personally, if I ever hit that situation (absolute worst case scenario) I have backups and can reinstall an Arch system in minutes.

For the most part, I've been really loving it.  The performance is pretty good, and it's nice to have osx for my non .net stuff.  However there are a few areas I ran into problems.  First I found I had to disable hardware acceleration in order to get WPF controls work.  This has impacted rendering performance more than i'd wish.  Second, and more painful, I've had issues with USB devices working (again a problem with the VM).  For the most part I can work around these issues, but the work arounds have impacted me in undesired ways (for instance the application i'm working on requires a dongle for security, i've been working around it by leaving a hack in the code... but once I accidentally checked it in..).

Many blog posts have this authoritative and overly confident tone. It's only after an entrepreneur experiences success that they admit how they ""did everything wrong."" (see Suster, Mark) This pattern makes sense; as a startup CEO you need to always be selling.  Once you ""make it"" it's hard to disabuse people of the notion you are competent.<p>Jason, as he'd probably readily admit, hasn't ""made it"" on this scale yet.  That's what makes this post so courageous. At some point, Jason will be raising money for 42floors and a potential investor will ask him about Flightcaster. He won't be able to spin the story of Flightcaster in a way that makes him look like a dot com hero. I'm impressed that Jason put this out there.",1316227875

3007081,comment,3002861,3007020,1,0,molesy,,,"This may be working great in your application but you're implying that it scales nicely and you're wrong about that - hand waving may work in your case, but Baron's whole point was that there are easy solutions that will make things better if and when an application grows to the point at which it's an issue.<p>I've personally been down this road many times, and the last time I made the mistake of relying on SELECT FOR UPDATE in a queueing system it broke down somewhere on the road between 1msgs/sec and 50msgs/sec. That application committed before it dispatched to the worker app so I would consider it a fairly similar access pattern as yours.<p>The solution I went with in that case was exactly what Baron describes at ""Locking is actually quite easy to avoid."" - something along the lines of UPDATE queue SET selected_by = dispatcher_id, selected_time = NOW().. and then SELECT * FROM queue WHERE selected_by = dispatcher_id. I hate putting pseudo-SQL because it's already setting bad ideas in some random reader's head. Anyways, that scaled up to several thousand messages per second and ran happily for years, long after I left that particular company. May still be running depending on who you ask.<p>Long story short, it's great that your solution is working for you but the weight of public knowledge suggests it's not a great solution for anyone else to pick up on. Ping Brigade looks nifty, I hope it works great for you. Please don't suggest this pattern to other people.<p>Personally the system I work on day-to-day these days runs a Redis set-based queue similar to Resque to send a few thousand emails per second and I'm ok with it. Not thrilled, but happy enough that I don't read the Resque introduction text and blanch in horror as I did reading your article, especially as a reply to Baron's which is based on... lots and lots of real world experience with many different applications.",1316227696

Is this an American thing? Or a Western thing in general?<p>I see people like this in every online community. They barely make enough money to pay for housing, food and utilities, yet they use credit cards to purchase Xboxes, e-readers, smartphones, expensive computers, Netflix, Pandora/Last.fm/GrooveShark/whatever, iPods, tablets, games off Steam and FSM knows what else[1]. And then they go eat at the local fast-food chain because it's cheaper than eating real food. Sometimes I have serious doubts about the sanity of these people.<p>Why are young people who don't make money being given credit cards?

But it is a misplaced notion in your case.<p>You describe your first attempt at a startup as a failure. It should be seen as a learning experience. Entrepreneurs tend to be risk seekers, which is why they take the chance on a startup to begin with. I would guess from your description of your actions with FlightCaster that you were far more risk averse the second time around, from which I conclude that likely you learned that you took too many heedless risks the first time.<p>Would there have been an exit with FlightCaster if you had taken more risks? Possibly not. Perhaps the level of risk you took on was exactly what was needed. The nature of life is such that you will never know.<p>It is good that you keep in mind how lucky you are, though. Many good people lose out while making all the right decisions. After all, even with a 95% likelihood of success for a particular action, 5% of people will still lose. And there are an awful lot of bets you need to win in order to get a startup off the ground.<p>So make sure you learn the lessons you can from the past, but keep it in perspective. Otherwise you will put too much emphasis on things. I wouldn't trust a person to run a company who didn't fear that it might fail, but fear is self-fulfilling if you let it. Striking a balance between the two is the key, and each experience you have helps you find it.",1316227480

Archbang and CTKArch are excellent liveCD versions of Arch but in the end I found I did not like the personal choices made by the creators of those releases.  My system is now truly mine.  I am in love with it.<p>My system is stable, and bleeding edge - an oxymoron.<p>Intellij is in the damn repositories... MondoDB 2.0 - the day it was released was in the damned repositores.<p>Anything else can't compete.<p>After installing Arch, and failing at least 3 times and being successful 2 other times, I found an appreciation for the way in which Arch did things.    My first version was a Mac OSx clone with some personal touches.  It was beautiful; but I was too ambitious and went with BTRFS which was a mistake.  So I reinstalled and now I'm on XFS and things purr.<p>I can setup a development environment in less than 10 minutes using pacman and then keep it updated easily.<p>To setup the equivalent environment on Ubuntu would take much longer for me.<p>I am not a linux newb nor a guru, but after using Arch I feel like I can hold my own.",1316225832

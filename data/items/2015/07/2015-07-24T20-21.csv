You can trade mark almost anything and if you can show you have been using the mark in commerce in a meaningful way then you can stop other people from using it in an infringing way - and you have to make an attempt to do so, or face possible future claims of trademark abandonment. Registration of a trade mark is <i>prima facie</i> proof of ownership and also allows you to collect statutory rather than just economic damages.<p><i>The only way it could genuinely be a trademark would be if it were used in a way completely unrelated to the character or story.</i><p>Who told you that? It&#x27;s wrong, wrong, wrong. Trade marks and copyright are totally separate beasts and bringing up TM issues in a discussion of copyright only confuses people.",1437771588

9945149,comment,9943431,9943431,0,0,lucaspiller,,,"I&#x27;ve posted about this before, but the UAE has an interesting solution to water and electricity generation.<p>One of the by products of oil production is natural gas that accumulates as pockets in the wells. Compared to crude oil this is a lot harder to store and transport, so in most cases is just burned off (if you ever fly over The Gulf at night, you can see the flames from the wells doing this).<p>This by product is what is used to generate water and electricity. Sea water is heated with the natural gas, and turned into steam which runs turbines to generate electricity. The steam is then cooled, which provides desalinated water. The water is stored in tanks for a few days where limestone rocks are added (from other parts of the country) to provide minerals, then fed into the public water system.<p>The newest &quot;M&quot; plant produces 2,000 MW of electricity and 140 million gallons of water a day, with an overall efficiency of 85%. It cost around $3 billion to build.<p><a href=""http://www.power-technology.com/projects/jebel-ali-m-station/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.power-technology.com/projects/jebel-ali-m-station...</a>",1437771549

If you live with children in the house, you know how that goes.</i><p>Having 5 younger siblings - I know very well how this goes. But is it a problem? If they lack similar interests what difference does it make if they&#x27;re both reading books if the books are different? If one is reading romance literature and the other Stephen King, are they in any better a situation?<p>Myself and the eldest of my siblings talk a lot about our personal interests, though we share very little of the same interests. We both enjoy learning and make a great effort to empathize with each other and understand each others&#x27; hobbies and do our best to encourage them. This close relationship, sadly, does not exist with my other siblings. I largely blame the age gap. I&#x27;m only 3 years older than the eldest but over 12 years older than the rest of them.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that offline has more potential for running into contradictory opinions and viewpoints. That&#x27;s why I find comment sections so important, although they are often dwindling and filled with flamebaiting trolls they are also one of the few sources of contradicting opinions that some people face.<p>But that same offline experience shows me that many people live in their own social bubbles of people with similarly-held beliefs. Religious institutions are my best example for this. How often do you find a Christian at a Mosque or reading the Quran? They&#x27;re mostly attending their own Church and associating with other people who go to that Church who largely hold the same beliefs they do. This extends to fanclubs, school cliques, and more social structures. People don&#x27;t tend to branch out.<p>Offline or online the scenario, to me, is largely the same and just as sad.",1437771529
9945143,comment,9943589,9945059,0,0,methodOverdrive,,,"Not many. I did go ahead and purchase his book. It&#x27;s... kind of a weird read, honestly. Useful - it clarified some things about the proposed Unum format - but also written very casually, like &quot;pop science&quot; prose, which seems inappropriate - who would buy a book about a floating-point number format if they didn&#x27;t want a dry, boring book full of technical details? Some of the arguments are made as though to convince a non-technical audience - maybe Gustafson wants managers (or former engineers who haven&#x27;t worked as engineers for a long time) to read his book, but I think it would have been better to publish all of the details without any fluff, first.<p>Also worth noting that half of the book is about the &quot;ubox&quot; method for solving optimization problems - also cool, but may be overkill if you are just interested in the numeric format itself. Personally, I&#x27;ve been working on an implementation of the format that I can toy around with - I have no real interest in learning a lot about the cool algorithms I could do with it until I can show myself that it works for basic arithmetic, etc, as well as the author claims.<p>Gustafson also makes the code available (I think [here](<a href=""https://www.crcpress.com/The-End-of-Error-Unum-Computing/Gustafson/9781482239867)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crcpress.com/The-End-of-Error-Unum-Computing/Gus...</a>).

9945106,comment,9943431,9944946,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"The water management situation in California is very complex. It really bugs me that desal is the most popular drum to beat, along with &quot;California is a desert&quot; and &quot;California is irresponsible&quot;.<p>California&#x27;s per capita water usage is roughly in the neighborhood of other western states (<a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/planetpolicy/posts/2014/10/differences_in_water_use_across_states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/planetpolicy/posts/2014/10/di...</a>, scroll down), and although there&#x27;s certainly room for improvement, it&#x27;s really not bad considering the massive amount of agriculture in California.<p>Not mentioned in the article -- unless I missed it -- is that the Carlsbad plant is being built at a cost of around $950 million, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it crossed the magic $1 billion line by the time it was operational. That&#x27;s a huge amount of money for just one plant; it could take around 50 plants of that size to completely offset the effects of an extended drought, and there would still be significant costs in then moving all of that water into the central valley areas where it&#x27;s needed for agriculture.<p>Everything that I&#x27;ve read recently is suggesting that what we&#x27;re experiencing now is likely to be the new normal for California. This is because the Sierra snowpack has become nearly nonexistent in recent years, and it previously accounted for around 30 percent of California&#x27;s total water storage, and it provided that water year-round. That&#x27;s a 30 percent haircut right off the top.<p>Even when we get wet seasons, it&#x27;s not expected that they will be <i>cold</i> wet seasons, which means we&#x27;ll see less snow in the mountains. And, since most of the rain that falls west of Sacramento gets funneled directly to the Bay, wet seasons won&#x27;t even be helpful in the long term.<p>So what&#x27;s happening is California is experiencing some of the effects of climate change. (I know HN at large doesn&#x27;t believe AGW is real, but that&#x27;s not really what this comment is about.) That means there&#x27;s going to have to be a lot of adaptation, and not just in one area.<p>California&#x27;s environmentalists -- and I usually count myself among them -- are going to have to get used to the idea of more dams and more reservoirs. California needs to make up for that missing 30% somehow. It also needs to start adopting water conservation the way that energy conservation has been seeing adoption; we should be seeing affordable greywater systems that move water from your bathroom sink into your toilet tank, for example, and residential water storage systems for landscape use should become more common.<p>We&#x27;re going to have to figure out how to handle the agricultural industry.

Amazon does not. In particular Amazon doesn&#x27;t count vendors who just selling through their platform, (they would be part of buyers/stockers at WallMart) Amazon doesn&#x27;t count any of the delivery personnel for things like OnTrak etc. And at one point I thought the warehouse workers were actually subcontracted through another firm but I may be mis-remembering that.<p>Thus from a business perspective you get rewarded by keeping workers off your payroll, but I don&#x27;t think it means people aren&#x27;t working for you. The poster child for this is the &#x27;sharing/gig/slaving&#x27; economy type places.<p>Because of that I am not convinced there is actually less human capital in moving the goods through Amazon or Walmart, but I do agree its accounted for differently. And that means I really can&#x27;t agree with it as evidence to support the claim that humans should work fewer hours.<p>It would make for a great paper, maybe even a nice book, on comparing how many hours of labor are invested and how many people in getting a product from manufacturing to your hands using the two different product flows (and doing that for a representative sample of all products offered).",1437771025

A significant difference in the valuation of the two companies is that with Wal-mart, the expectation of future cash flows (and therefore present value) comes primarily from its present size, the cash flows that brings, and its expected ability to continue bringing in such flows. Whereas with Amazon, which has much lower current market share and cash flow, the market is &quot;saying that Amazon&#x27;s growth prospects outweigh it relatively smaller size&quot;. Hence the proportion of expected future cash flows that investors expect to come in the form of future growth is significantly higher with Amazon than with Wal-Mart. Therefore you would expect Amazon to have a lower current size and current headcount per unit present valuation, even if there were no differences in productivity.<p>What I was criticizing was just using the ratio of present market cap and present headcount as a meaningful metric, when comparing companies with very different growth expectations. That effectively becomes a restatement of the different growth expectations: Amazon has the same market cap as Wal-Mart but its present size is smaller in almost any way you could count present size (sales, headcount, etc.).",1437770227

And they might marginally increase the security of the software and systems, but the business has to decide to invest in security before they&#x27;re allowed to focus on securing the system.

due to known surveillance. Though they might be pre-testing units
off-camera for the sake of giving a good &quot;demonstrating quality&quot; stage
show while being recorded by your system, there&#x27;s also the effect of
better behavior when knowingly being monitored. Either way, you win. ;)<p>The problem with pre-test is it can both decrease defect rate _and_
decrease throughput rate. Depending on how much each decrease is, you
can actually decrease yield/time rather than increase it. This exact
problem exists on PCB manufacturing. It&#x27;s certainly possible to pre-test
every component as it comes off the reel and before it&#x27;s used on the
PCB. The component pre-test does decrease defect rates of the finished
boards, but it also decreases throughput rate, so it can negatively
impact yield/time. The decision then becomes an investment/accounting
problem. Often, post-mfg circuit/component test automation and reworking
failed boards makes more sense financially.<p>As far as I know, no one does hard or soft real-time verification of the
human side of manufacturing and lab experimentation, but _my_ knowledge
of the current state of the art is admittedly outdated. Using CV and ML
to spot human manufacturing errors (or inefficiencies) seems feasible if

My main source is Walter Isaacson&#x27;s book. Einstein was a humanist who cared much for the well being of humans. He was a social person by all accounts, forming warm relationships with people from all walks of life. As a youth, he was a keen student of music and philosophy, as evinced by his deep involvement in a study group with a couple of his friends. His personal relationships and tribulations (e.g. divorcing Mileva Maric and marrying his cousin) seem no more deviant than that of many normal people. He was a committed pacifist who campaigned for many issues by using his standing in society as an intellectual. He supported the Zionist cause, decried racism and bigotry, etc. He wrote many essays and expressed very clear and reasonable opinions on a wide range of topics ranging from the American society to nuclear weapons.<p>Compare that to Pearlman declining the Fields Medal and Newton dabbling with alchemy and occultism, which are both representative of fairly weird behavior.

If Amazon does actually succeed in growing to Wal-Mart levels of sales, it will end up with a lot more employees than it currently has, though quite possibly still fewer than Wal-Mart.",1437768546

I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.&quot;</i>",1437768531

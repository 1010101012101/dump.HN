3360174,comment,3359302,3359302,10,0,kogir,,,"I'm pretty sure I understand how this works, but please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>As currently implemented, it appears that if the Primary Identity Authority or Secondary Identity Authority keys are compromised, then all accounts for which that authority is trusted are also compromised.  This enables accounts to be compromised en masse, rather than individually.  It would seem that by de-centralizing authentication, browserid centralizes security.<p>Ok, so revoke the compromised certificate. If you ""trust"" browserid.org and do assertion verification on your own servers, how are you notified of the compromise and key change?  Conversely, if you offload assertion checking to browserid.org and they go down, will users really understand why they can't log in and your site is ""broken""? You could use CRLs and OSCP, but now you have another thing to get wrong in individual sites' assertion verification implementations.<p>Another interesting side effect of PIA or SIA key compromise is that an attacker could now <i>create</i> accounts and impersonate users, not just access existing ones.<p>It would also appear that due to the omission of a nonce, assertions are vulnerable to replay within the validity window.<p>I think that authentication is broken, and commend attempts to fix it.  I'm just not sure that all the added complexity of browserid really buys us anything, and instead enables new attacks that previously weren't feasible.",1324028671

(For instance, we have this recent study questioning the widely-held belief that men are by nature better at spatial reasoning: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/women-math-science..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/women-math-science...</a>)\n</i><p>The problem is, there's a ""fair amount of evidence"" on both sides, and it's universally shoddy research.<p>On the ""innate difference"" side, the most that can usually be done is to show that a discrepancy exists, and that it exists broadly in a statistical sense, argue that it exists broadly enough to posit that the effect is at least partially biological.<p>On the ""no innate difference"" side, the most that can usually be done is to pick out a couple of instances where the claimed effect doesn't exist, argue that if it doesn't exist everywhere then it's not real, and claim that this exception proves that it can't possibly be biological at all.<p>The ""innate difference"" folks then reject the debunkings as relying on cherry-picked data (in some cases this is fair, in some cases probably not, and unfortunately the level of statistical rigor in most papers on both sides is horrendous, so it's hard to say for sure), the ""no innate difference"" people disagree, and nothing is ever resolved.<p>The problem, of course, is that there's absolutely no realistic way to do a study that removes the effect of people growing up in a world that has the current set of gender roles, so both sides are right, in a sense: none of the ""innate difference"" papers actually prove that the differences are primarily biological, and none of the debunkings prove that they're not.<p>So everybody falls back on their priors. And our priors on these matters are pretty naive, more based on emotion and the minimal set of observations that we each personally have than anything else. Women that are good at math, feminists, and those that generally side with nurture assume that the burden of proof is on the ""nature"" folks to prove that there <i>is</i> an innate difference (because it's ""obvious"" that men and women are equal intellectually), and the nature types assume the burden of proof goes the other way (because they look at the observed statistical discrepancies and assume that they should be taken at face value until debunked). So we all end up arguing over what set of assumptions is more reasonable, throwing meaningless references to studies at each other as if the studies actually prove anything, which they usually don't.<p>It's quite the mess. I would ask, at least, that everyone on either side of this try to think of at least a few experiments that would actually change your mind on these matters. They're actually kind of tough to come up with, because it's so difficult to separate culture from the equation...",1324027311

I'm sure Viacom as a perfectly good reason for blocking off Canada, but read on...<p>""...I have a profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would have owned your private information for their own use. They would have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way, you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you). You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from us again.""<p>Does this link work? <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/09/christopher-hitchens-on-t_n_605874.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/09/christopher-hitchen...</a>",1324026223

I do know that we need to be proactively driving new ideas and not be so reactive. They have checkins, and group coupons, and native apps, and just got a valuation of thirty billion; WE need to have checkins! We need group coupons! Bring on the native apps! I hope future designer-entrepreneurs can be more proactive and present a state that doesnt yet exist.

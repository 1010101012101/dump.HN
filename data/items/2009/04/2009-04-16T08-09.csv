564913,comment,564768,564891,0,0,randy,,,"I for one would like to see some proof on that matter, not that I neccesarily disbelieve that statement, but it is an interesting dynamic. Obviously more educated people may stray away from clicking on ads for free iPods or hot local singles dying to meet them, but you could say the same about less affluent people clicking on ads regarding BMW's, high fashion, SaaS's, or a wild excursion on the Serengeti (obviously some these examples are slightly strawman-ish, but the point is there are many products out there that need more exposure, of which advertising is an option, that require money, of which affluent people have more of and are presumably more willing to spend because of that). Rich or poor, educated or uneducated, everyone has needs, everyone.<p>But of course, that's not even the point, because at the end of the day, you really care about maximizing user value, which for ads is frequency * (CPC or CPM). Now, obviously the CPC rates are higher for a BMW relative to a free iPod and the CPM rates are also higher if you know the audience is affluent, higher still if they are a fan of BMW on FB, higher still if you know their status is 'looking for a new car', etc. LinkedIn has fairly high CPM's from what I hear.<p>So is my conclusion that more affluent users are more valuable than less affluent ones? No, I don't know that, but that is my hypothesis, and I'd like to see some evidence pointing one way or the other (actual non-anecdotal evidence, and not just Myspace makes more than Facebook, since they run two very different ad systems and since we all know that correlation only goes so far).",1239871696

Why is this not a more pressing issue for the postgresql developers?</i><p>I went to the SF Postgres meetup a month or two ago where they talked about new features in 8.4.  Josh Berkus, one of the core devs hosts the meetup.<p>Anyhoo, hot standby _is_ a huge issue for them.  We talked about it for 20 minutes.  They had a dev who worked his tail off on the issue for several months.  There was a lot of hope that hot standby was going to make it into the 8.4 release, but there were a few too many bugs on corner cases for them to ship the feature in 8.4 without a big refactor.<p>Postgres core is very concerned about replication, but shipping a stable product is their biggest concern.  So, good news is that hot standby is a big priority for 8.5.  Bad news, is the release isn't slated until next year.",1239870529

564898,comment,564350,564675,0,0,whatusername,,,"oh I agree completely.  (And that explains why google is valuable - intention definitely counts.)<p>My contrast was to TV - when I'm watching TV I'm there to watch a show - (superbowl maybe an exception) - and the ads are an interruption.  I can't see how that is much better than advertising on FB - aside from the fact it's been around longer.  FB also knows more about me (at least it should - I'm always amused getting ads for dating sites when my profile is kinda clear that I'm married).<p>To go to your bar example - that depends on how it's done.  I've bought beer mugs from a bar/brewery before - I saw the sign that they were for sale.  I then had to take an action (click the link) and go to the counter and buy them.  Or in terms of taxis - the rank could be there as you go in/out of the bar - perhaps even signs / posters / bar mats / coasters / etc.  At the end of the night when I need a cab - then I can act on the info I've been looking at.  
Now if the cab driver came up to me while talking to my friends and tried to get me into his cab - that's a different story.  But branding and well targeted service offerings - that's definitely valuable.  And facebook should know that I want to go to the next Living End show in Melbourne, and I want to buy the next Wheel of Time book, and I'm likely to want to go see the next Harry Potter movie.  The TV station doesn't know that - and so might show me useless ads for VB or the new Zac Efron movie...",1239870311

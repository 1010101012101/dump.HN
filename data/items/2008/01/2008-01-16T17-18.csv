99348,comment,99206,99226,0,0,rcoder,,,"Actually, MySQL could really use an embedded procedure-writing language. Java wouldn't be the worst choice they could make, especially given the proliferation of other languages implemented atop the JVM -- being able to use JRuby for stored procedures inside a running MySQL instance (with no network I/O or marshalling overhead) would pretty much rock.<p>Of course, you could also just use Postgres, which already lets you embed your choice of scripting language(s) in the database server...",1200505973

2) Be a ""surrogate"" customer, live their lives and adopt their persona
3) Be frugal, use your VC money as working capital and treat it as the last money you ever going to have and need
4) ... and more<p>--Denny--",1200505279

Any license that allows that is OK by me.<p>Some ideas I've got floating around are to use it for scripting (instead of, say, LUA or XSLT) and for config files (instead of XML) in existing apps. Also, lisp seems fantastically placed for HTML generation, so if I embed it in an IIS or Apache site, then great!",1200504789

99336,comment,98227,98670,0,0,stevecooperorg,,,"Heh. Can't say that vi makes me feel much better ;)<p>Pg has a lot of people fired up about using lisps, but right now it's a sport you can only participate in if you've got a certain -other- set of skills like vi and emacs and a decent knowledge of system administration.  Preconditions like this limit the user community massively. Small communities find it difficult to get momentum.<p>I've forced myself to stick with emacs/slime because basically that's that there is. I'm getting comfortable, and starting to like it. But I think it's actually a kind of Helsinki syndrome...<p>I'd like to write the next Viaweb, and I'd like to write it in Lisp. But if the basic language is inviting, the rest of the environment is sorta hostile; a shangri-la in a swamp.<p>So the quality of the installer, the libraries distributed with it, the documentation, and the bundled editor will ultimately affect it's success.",1200504286

You can treat is as a network drive or setup automated backups. The protocol is open so you can use tools like S3 Firefox Organizer to retrieve your data outside of the Jungledisk front-end.<p>Another big plus is that you can run an unlimited number of instances across any number of machines after paying a one time fee of $25.",1200502959

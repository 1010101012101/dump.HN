10173899,comment,10170089,10173323,0,0,fenomas,,,"Very fair point, and believe me I heard it from a lot of users. My answer is (was), the pressure to improve has always been from competitors, and that doesn&#x27;t change under a subscription model. I know people tend to see Photoshop as an endless monopoly, but actually tons of rivals pop up and get users in significant numbers (e.g. Sketch), and they do it by being lightweight and flexible. And if Photoshop just kept being huge and adding on ten more huge features per year it would inevitably become a relic, if not by losing old users then definitely by failing to attract new ones.<p>Not to dismiss your point though - it&#x27;s absolutely possible that the company gets complacent and stops innovating and collects rent. I just don&#x27;t think anything <i>really</i> stops people from ditching Adobe if that happens. In this sense I think people overestimate the tools&#x27; intrinsic value and underestimate the value of the updates each year. That is, I like Photoshop better than its competitors today, and I felt the same way three years ago, but between a three year-old version of PS and its competitors today I&#x27;d switch in a second, and I think many others would too. In other words, the only reason PS maintains its monopoly-like dominance is that it&#x27;s kept innovating, and if one side of that equation changes the other will too.<p>With that said, playing devil&#x27;s advocate against myself, one big argument against what I&#x27;m saying here is lock-in from file formats like PSD - if people subscribe and make PSD files, the risk of losing work if they switched tools removes some of the pressure on Adobe to innovate. At the time of the CC switch Adobe said they would come out with some way to make sure people don&#x27;t get locked out of their files, but I don&#x27;t know if anything happened with that or not. A lot of tools support PSD these days so maybe it&#x27;s not a hot issue but I think it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind.<p>Sorry to go to such length but I hope that answers your question.",1441425399

Even if acquited of murder, the burglar&#x27;s family can sue you for wrongful death - the evidentiary bar for wrongful death is much lower than for murder.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to be acquited of murder, but convicted in civil court and ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to a burglar&#x27;s family.<p>Not to mention the fact that in a criminal trial, if the guy is dead he doesn&#x27;t testify against you.<p>&quot;Dead men don&#x27;t sue&quot; is a thing.",1441425335

I still think my picture is more explanatory at the speeds I commute at (almost always below 45mph, with most steering at sub 25mph).<p>How do braking forces play into this, and do you know what kinds of speeds we&#x27;re talking about? A soft front tyre (i.e. lower than normal pressure) has a dramatic effect on handling at street / city speeds - the extra rolling resistance makes the steering want to steer further into the turn, causing a countersteer upright. So you need to fight the steering to maintain line. But of course when putting a bike on track, you run with lower pressures as a matter of course - and I know from anecdotal experience that it is possible, on track, to brake while leaned over a bit hard enough to start lifting the rear, something that would require an immense effort to avoid straightening up at street speeds.<p>You&#x27;ve given me something to think about, but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be able to solve the problem without either learning a lot more mathematics, or playing with models...",1441425294

IIRC the tool worked normally for up to a month without pinging the server, and after that showed warnings but kept working for a while. The times may have changed but idea was to err as far as possible on the side of lenience, because anyone using a version that pings the server is by definition a paying customer and not a pirate.",1441422361

That also was not what I was describing.<p>You seem to be a fairly adept programmer. The concept of improvisational programming makes sense for you - you draw on years of experience and training (formal, or not) to feel out a concept when you have a goal in mind but no clear way to get there. You probably perform many small experiments to learn more about the intricacies of whatever you are working on. You can do all this because you&#x27;ve progressed past the beginning stages.<p>Most beginners simply aren&#x27;t capable of this. There are too many blind alleys. Too many traps. It&#x27;s not that I discourage self-directed learning, experimenting or researching - all are essential to learning computer science. Rather I&#x27;ve seen far too many students simply resort to guess and check methodology when face with a problem. This isn&#x27;t the kind of guided exploration that comes with experience but: &quot;Adding 1 to that index didn&#x27;t work - I wonder if 2 will? 3? 4? 10? Oh! 12 works! Great - I&#x27;m done!&quot;<p>Incidentally, I have done data entry. My first computer was an Apple II. I used to type in programs from magazines without really understand what they were doing. Even worse, I typed in raw hexadecimal program data. I know what it&#x27;s like to type something in you don&#x27;t understand, find out it&#x27;s wrong, tweak it, and try again <i>ad infinitum</i> (or so it seemed). &quot;Does A9 work? What about AA? AC? ...AF works! Great - I&#x27;m done!&quot;",1441422283

In general everything was more communal, and there wasn&#x27;t a lot of independent loner, do-your-own-thing, dog-eat-dog mentality that is so pervasive in American culture. I&#x27;m not even going to discuss the merits / negatives of each particular worldview, but what I do know is that I find it utterly depressing that I&#x27;ve worked and interacted with my (now former) colleagues for close to 3 years and none of them even care enough to ask me what I&#x27;m going to do with my life afterwards and what my next plans are (today was my last day).",1441422274

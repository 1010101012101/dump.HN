Plus, that video data does eventually make it to the kernel and then the video hardware (often via a separate overlay interface like DirectShow, Xv, or VDPAU, though that is probably not the case with web browsers), so a vulnerability at any point along the chain is a serious issue.",1302598733

They are paid entirely by commission and no sales means no income so there is no question about what they are paid.

2436418,comment,2434187,2435074,0,0,pmjordan,,,"As <i>danvet</i> has hinted at, on-disk data structures don't exist in isolation. You've generally got a CPU and memory system attached to the disk that is orders of magnitude faster[1], so if you can reduce the number of dependent disk I/O operations by increasing the required processing power, that's usually a trade-off you want to take. As an example, linear searches through each 4kiB disk block you read are absolutely acceptable, whereas doing that for an associative data structure in memory is madness.<p>In any case, having inspected the 2 papers a little more in depth, this data structure is very different from Clojure's in that it holds multiple versions directly.[2] Additionally, it does indeed take all the trade-offs to minimise disk I/O in favour of more computation. I find it unlikely that much insight can be gained from this for in-memory data structures.<p>[1] you can expect ~10ms latency for spinning disks, ~10-100µs for solid-state drives, ~10ns for memory and ~1ns for the CPU. spinning disk to memory is 6 orders of magnitude, 3-4 OOM for solid-state drives.<p>[2] In Clojure the MVCC STM is implemented at the <i>ref</i> level, not the collection level. Doing it at the collection level may be possible, but probably not desireable as complexity will go through the roof.",1302597717

The less SSTables there are the less random I/O) so write spikes create poor read performance and 2) Bloom filters don't work for range queries so they tank in Cassandra in general.

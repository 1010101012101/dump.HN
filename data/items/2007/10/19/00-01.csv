70053,comment,69763,69801,0,0,majimojo,,,"I like the mental model description. I think programming (like other skilled arts) requires constant evolution of programming mental models or memes.<p>Developing new languages is a great exercise in creating new tools to solve specific problems.  Rails really kicked the status quo and made programming so much easier for a bunch of us.  But is it possible to ever create a language that will make all the different kind of programming problems equally easy?  It always seems like there is a tradeoff, programming abstractions vs performance.  As another case, all of us know english, but how many of us are great writers? (not I!  haha)<p>Great link though.  Look forward to the day when game programming is as easy as brainstorming out loud to our computers.",1192755241

I have been using with Windows 2000 and Sql Server 2000 because I don't want to pay MS more money but if I go to 64 bit servers then I would need at least Windows 2003 and SQL Server 2005.

If you do not have a chewing gum in your mouth, then there is no Bubble coming anytime soon. What is happening is simply a change in Market   Research. Yes. That is all. I am not going to give another expose on how Technology cost is so low compared to 3, 5, 10 years ago. This single factor allows entrepreneurs to test out the market before investing the big bucks.  How is this any different than the 50k to 100k they pay focus groups and consultants to find if a market is feasible or not. Now for merely that same amount of money we see companies being created to test the market. If it works then fine, if not then NEXT. This is all it is Trial periods. the only problem is that we don't hear about the consultant who pocketed 200k to google, copy and paste and tell the corporations to go or not to go. If we did, they would scream Bubble for consultant too. We see hungry and creative youngsters who do it for themselves. So please, let's keep that Bubble talk in the wrapper until we need fresh breath, from what i see there is no shortage of creativity and users. Sorry if I offended anyone. ",1192754870

I want to see some evidence of clean upgrade process first. :-)<p>Seriously, as an engineer I doubt it will be easy: the success of this update procedure depends on reliable upgrade of <i>every single component</i> in the system: not just the kernel/drivers/gnome/etc, but things that I installed afterwards, including those that I compiled, including those that depend on kernel version. For instance I have no reason to believe that VMware will continue working. Similarly, I expect to see issues with video drivers.<p>And finally, my friend who's been running Gutsy beta got an unbootable laptop after a series of online updates. Linux is solid software. However, all software has bugs, especially if it's forcefully put on a 6-months release cycle.<p>There is a very good reason why you don't see new Debian releases very often.",1192753916

70041,comment,69868,69984,0,0,timr,,,"You've missed my point.<p>I understand that [] is a method in Ruby.  In fact, operator[] is also a method name in C++, and can be overloaded, overridden, etc.  Ruby did not invent these features.  Likewise, in C++, the type of an object and the method name invoked determine unambiguously the method that is called.<p>The difference -- and this is critical -- is that in the C++ community, there is a strong bias <i>against</i> syntactical games that make code behave inconsistently.  Having operator[] behave differently for different subscripts would be a mortal sin in C++ design (not to mention that the type system would probably punish you for it).<p>We can debate the relative merits of strong/weak typing, but the principle of least surprise is a good one, and should be respected, regardless of what a language may allow you to do (cf. Perl).",1192753675

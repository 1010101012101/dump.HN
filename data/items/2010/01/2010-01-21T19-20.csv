Incredibly, this was supposed to be ""Fetch from database"" (dog, fetch, geddit?). Even after days of using it my brain still locked up looking at the damn dog - imagine my poor users who only had to interact with the software occasionally. Switching the icons to text cleared up any confusion.<p>Unless screen real estate is really at a premium (eg iPhone), I prefer to see text, and any application that gives me the choice (eg. Firefox) I immediately configure to do so.",1264103902

So, I didn't send you an email, and then you send me an email with the indicator ""Re:"" which traditionally (well, in the last few years of email history) means that you are responding to my email... which I didn't send.<p>Sorry to be a purist, but I consider that a misleading subject line, which is one of the indicators of spam.<p>Yes, traditionally, RE: meant ""in regards to"" and was a standard header on memos to denote the subject (watch Mad Men if you don't recall memos).  But we all know that nowadays it is the changed subject line of an email response in a thread... which is why it gets the attention the author mentions.<p>Sure, we all have to do whatever we can to get noticed.  But maybe I'm the only one here who thinks that there are ways to do this without ""overloading"" the RE.  And please don't say ""ah, but his is Re, while Outlook uses RE, totally different!"".  Because it's not.<p>As a test, try something other than RE:  Try using ""Subj:"" or Oh, one more thing re: price list or any of the other countless ways one can get attention in a subject without ""fooling"" the user.<p>The mispelling, though, is not a bad touch.",1264103883
1068163,comment,1067763,1068108,0,0,singlow,,,"I guess that PuTTY could be excused since that is more related to the SSH login sequence. It doesn't really matter which SSH tool you are using, that basic annoyance will be there. But when you are using the ssh command from a bash prompt, it is less work to cancel and start over than it is to reopen putty.<p>If you are opening a connection that is not saved in your session list, you might consider choosing ""Duplicate Session"" from the window menu at the top left and avoid retyping the server address in the putty dialog. The annoying thing is that the ""Restart Session"" command is not available when the connection is still open, so you will need to close the dysfunctional one after launching the duplicate.<p>If it is a saved session, you can store the user name under Connection->Data so that you do not need to type it on each launch.",1264103868

This seems even more like a bastard child to me now than I originally thought, not to mention a completely confusing user experience.
3. What exactly is the audience here.

  . code 
  . conditional code (if statements) 
  . repeating code (loops/while/until/for) 
  . code grouping (procedures/methods/functions) 
  . variable grouping (records/structs)
</code></pre>
More advanced concepts then become<p><pre><code>  . boolean logic (extension to conditionals)
  . Object oriented coding (think: code+struct grouping)
  . namespaces (think: grouping of objects)
  . generics / reflections
  . pointers
    (certain languages expose this completely
    (some implicitly: through pass by val or pass by ref
    (some implicitly: by primitives vs objects
  . preprocessor (only certain languages)
  . recursion (repeating code but through function)
  . functional features
</code></pre>
----<p>How do you pick these concepts up?  Few ways, but I think the following three are most common:<p>1) Old School Method :: Understand what is happening on the bare metal, and then work building syntactic sugar between what is happening really, and what you want to happen.<p><pre><code>  Assembly
  -> C
    -> OPP (C++/Java/C#)
      -> scripting (Perl/Python/Ruby)
        -> Functional (Lisp)
</code></pre>
2) New Schooling :: Doing simple things in simple way (KISS principle), and then moving towards complicated systems  ( a decent litmus test for language complexity is 'hello world' program.  The more lines / syntax it requires, the more complicated language is. For example: for Java one needs to use objects / namespaces / static methods / functions / etc ) -> used by new academia<p><pre><code>  Scripting (Python/Ruby)
  -> C#/Java/C++
</code></pre>
3) Learning on the job :: fixing existing code, read code, tweak it, rinse, repeat.  Learn from examples.  Used by some vocational schools.<p>----<p>Libraries are in itself own big concept.  Languages without libraries are bare, and, outside of curiosity, not practical.  Very often knowing a language implies not only understanding of language grammar, but also it's libraries<p>You can think that libraries define half of what is considered programming language.

The whole dial represented 12 minutes, so just estimate how far to turn it.  My new microwave has 22 buttons.  I forget which is which.  I have to turn on the lights and get my glasses.<p>The previous owner installed vertical blinds on the double hung windows.  Think about that.  Impossible to have open windows without endless noise and movement.<p>An office where I work is near an airport.  They have a key card system that beeps with a successful swipe.  So you can't hear the beep when an airplane is passing overhead (every 5 minutes) and have to wait until it's gone to get into the building.<p>Another office has ""gone green"" and installed motion sensors everywhere to turn off lights not being used.  Good luck finishing up in the restroom if you've been sitting too long.<p>Some of my software asks ""Save before exit?"" <i>whether I've changed anything or not</i>.  I got so tired of trying to remember if I had updated or only viewed, I just click ""Yes"" every time.  Pointless.<p>Every time the garbage truck drops the dumpster back down next door, 3 car alarms go off.  No one ever responds, because they assume that it's a false alarm.  Not that big a deal until the garbage truck shows up at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.<p>My TV remote has 33 buttons.  So they're so small, you have to stop and look at it to hit ""Mute"" or ""Last Channel"", the only 2 buttons I ever use.  Who designed this thing, a munchkin?<p>The airports in Orlando, Philadelphia, San Jose, and Miami put the restaurants (not counting junk food) <i>outside</i> of security.  So you have to wonder, ""Do I have enough time to eat and then get through the line?""  (Pittsburgh, Tampa, and Chicago Midway did it right.)<p>The trunk release and gas cap release levers in my car are next to each other but not visible.  It's hard to pull one without the other.  Seems like my gas cap door is always open.<p>A theater we went to the other night only had aisles on the sides with 50 seats in between.  Do your really want that great seat in the center knowing you may have to climb over 25 people if you need the restroom before the movie is over?<p>Intersections that gridlock because of traffic from the next light.

I got started computing on a 17 inch, 640x480 resolution display, so not that much larger in terms of usable screen real estate. Now, I have two 22 inch, 1680x1050 resolution displays, one turned vertically. For comparison, I made this image

This is a strong motivating factor.  If you like it, you'll keep learning more in order to accomplish more.<p>Tasks that save you time and effort are a good place to start.  Tasks that entertain you are another.<p>In this regard, a scripting language with a good interface to your system (file access, graphics/presentation support, network support) is often cited as a good place to start.  Many people suggest Python.<p>As you move to tackling larger problems, and/or growing your previous work, you'll find it beneficial to learn more about designs and techniques that aid in staying organized, keeping your work maintainable and efficient, etc.  At that point, you'll want to look beyond the references for the language you started in and learn more general principles.  (But even when you start, look for the BEST references in the language of your choice.  The best references incorporate some of this context and explain it well, giving you a head start and helping you to avoid ""bad"" practices you may latter have to ""unlearn"".)<p>P.S.  Perhaps implied in the above, the environment you want to work in / control will influence your choice.  For ""general"" programming -- freestanding programs running on your machine -- you might find e.g Python the best starting point.  If you mostly want to control things in your browser, then Javascript (along with HTML, CSS, and the DOM model -- which is already incorporating a quantity of semi-arbitrary detail that frustrates some people).  If you were trying to ease administering a UNIX-flavor environment, you might consider Perl.  If you spend most of your time in Microsoft Office documents, then Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) or whatever it is these days.<p>How long it takes depends largely on you.  Some people, particularly with a strong motivation to accomplish specific things, learn quite a lot in a couple of months.

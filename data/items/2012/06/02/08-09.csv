When students reach a point where they should start researching their own questions, rather than asking me for help, I introduce them to StackOverflow.  It is really interesting to watch how students react to the SO community.<p>To participate effectively in the SO community, there are pretty clear guidelines.  Do some initial research, state exactly what you are trying to do, state what you have already tried, and state a specific question.  After that, there are clear guidelines for how to interact with the people who try to help you.  These guidelines are much more real than a lot of the artificial rules I see students subjected to in schools.<p>A student who understands the SO community is a student who will likely be able to get their own questions answered throughout their lives, in any field they are interested in.

It's worth noting that in some countries the tipping process also varies regionally or even from restaurant to restaurant.<p>Now that I'm older and more callous I have simplified the process. I look at the receipt to check if there is a tip already included. If it is, we're done. Sure, I had discussions with waiters who insisted this is the bare minimum and I <i>have</i> to give something extra on top of that but now I simply leave and never go to that place again. If the tip isn't on the receipt, they get 10-20% depending on the quality of service. So far, this works well in every country.<p>I believe foreigners get a lot of abuse and are sometimes scammed by obnoxious staff who like to take advantage of the cultural insecurities of visitors.

What you, Wrap, say, sounds like you think that the ""palestinian people"" (whatever that is or was) are the victims in that case and have done nothing to nobody. That is just wrong and i advise you to read up on the whole story.<p>Also, from my point of view, the right of existance of Israel is not a topic of discussion anymore. Maybe it was unfortunate to found it where it's been founded after WW2, but that is not something that can be changed now in any sensible way.<p>And, come on, Wrap, the Jews where ""emigrating"" from Europe to ""kill and drive a people off their own land and claim it as their own""??? That is just ridiculous. Please get an education.<p>Last point about Irans political system: It does not have ""major problems"", it is basically run by sad men greedy for power that use religion as means of suppression. The one thing you have to give them, is that Iran/Persia was not a very aggressive country in the past. But that's it.

The agreement is different with every casino, and within each casino, the allocation amount is different for each cocktail waitress depending on her shift and station.  I will use the following as an example, and please keep in mind...this is just an example, a hypothetical, a not-for-real made-up FYI.<p>""Let's say I am allocated 25 per drink.  If I bring out a hundred drinks that day, the IRS assumes I made $25.00, and that amount is added on to my paycheck as income.  Whatever income bracket I fall into at the end of the year determines how much in taxes I will have to pay, or have paid.  How does the IRS know how many drinks I take out?  Because each time I get an order from the bartender, he swipes my ID badge, or enters my employee number, and he records whatever drinks I take out on the computer.  By the way, whether it's a bottled water or a Long Island or a glass of champagne, they are each counted as one drink.<p>""If I am allocated by the hour, it works the same way, except now it doesn't matter if I take out one drink or a hundred in that hour, I will be allocated the same amount.  (The bartender still records my drinks for the casino's records.)  Obviously it would be to my advantage financially to take out more drinks.  Let's say I get allocated $10.00 an hour and it's really slow, or I'm a lazy-ass and just stand around; if I serve just one drink that hour and I get stiffed, I'm still going to be taxed on $10.00 even though I haven't made it.<p>""Did I mention that the above is just an example, to be used for reference only?  Please do not quote a quarter a drink or $10.00 an hour as fact or an absolute for all cocktail waitresses!  I do not know how much each cocktail waitress is allocated, and it is also not my own personal allocation.  It is just a clarification.<p>""Another thing: the IRS agreement is already in place with each casino, but each girl has the option of signing it or not.  This is a very private matter, so while I don't know for a fact, I'm going to say that 99% of all cocktail waitresses do sign it.  If a waitress does not sign the agreement, she is required to report her own tips.""",1338625262

When the CTO of a big, tech savvy company decides he doesn't want Windows 8 on his or her own desktop, how will that influence their decisions with regards to the whole company? For myself, if Metro were out of the equation Windows 8 would be a sure purchase. There are lots of awesome features in there, like Hyper-V in the workstation OS (something they should have enabled in Win7) and lots of other cool stuff. But with Metro being shoved down my throat I might just wait and see.<p>Another big problem is that they are rebranding instead of creating a new brand. They are trying to drag the Windows architecture and brand onto the tablet platform. I think there's a very real risk that this will tarnish that attempt. One of the big reasons people have gravitated towards tablets is because they are so fundamentally different and lack all the traditional hassles of old style operating systems. I think there's a very real risk that the public perception of Windows 8 based tablets is that it's just new skin on old bones. That risk is heightened by the fact that such an assessment is substantially correct.<p>And by putting all of their eggs in one unified Metro basket (a classic ""strategy tax"" mistake) they risk failure on one leg dooming the other. If, hypothetically, Windows 8 tablet sales were very weak that could color people's impressions of the quality of Windows 8 as a desktop OS.",1338624441

They got into MySpace. They started wanted to ""tweak"" things. That got them into HTML/CSS. That got them into JavaScript. That got them into coding.<p>Or I've seen people start with hypercard back when hypercard was the biz.<p>Or I've seen people start with Director (and later Flash) and move on from there.<p>The other thing I saw several times back in the day when I taught development to non-dev folk was that some folk were really <i>put off</i> by the command line. I remember we had a course that I taught that was built around an GUI IDEish environment where folk were building a little SHRDLU type app. At the same time a subset of the course were on a ""beginners C"" course that was all command line driven.  The C course was good and well taught - but some folk <i>hated</i> it, but made superb progress on the IDEish course. It was <i>freaky</i> to see the same people spend hours ranting about finding files and overstepping array bounds by one on one course, while successfully building basic NLP apps on another :-)<p>Now - I like the RasPi. It's a cute box. But I'm unconvinced that it's going to make any significant difference in the number or kind of young folk who go play with development tools.  I can't really picture anybody (child or parent) purchasing one of these who wouldn't <i>already</i> be the type to poke at a home Linux box or PC in a developerish way.<p>With the way that cheap PCs get recycled is the price point going to be enough? It's great for hobbyist hackers - but they were <i>already</i> hobbyist hackers :-)",1338624118

118503,comment,118288,118288,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm concerned that the way we fund and review science has some big problems. I don't want to get into a 30,000 word essay here, but some sciences are starting to sound like echo-chambers where there is a narrative and research is supposed to support that narrative. Double-blind peer reviews should help with that, or at least try to help. But I remain skeptical that anything serious is going to be done until science completes politicizing itself somewhere in the next 2-3 decades.",1203379080

118495,comment,118437,118439,0,0,boucher,,,"Wordpress has become the defacto standard in blogging systems.  I can think of only very few scenarios where someone would want something that they couldn't just use Wordpress for.<p>Not to mention, with the large user base it has, you can get things like plugins and themes to customize your site without doing a lot of work. Plus, the template system is easy enough that writing your own custom theme should be a piece of cake.",1203378445

Then you'll know that what you're making is something they want, because a bunch of people probably requested it.  Also it makes your users feel more involved which is especially important in the beginning.",1203378305
118492,comment,118288,118444,0,0,danteembermage,,,"The trouble with double blind is that in many disciplines the number of people publishing is quite small, and then when you get into sub disciplines you get a very small number. If you've shopped a paper around at conferences and workshops before submitting it, it can be fairly unlikely that a person qualified to review the manuscript doesn't know who wrote a paper or couldn't find out with a phone call.<p>So effectively you get single blind (if that, it is often pretty obvious who your referee was if you know the writing style or the referee keeps citing papers by the same author) . However, even though it often doesn't work very well in practice, not doing it doesn't work with perfect certainty.",1203378200

I kept the dude on the phone for a good 5 minutes before he asked if ""this is about getting my number off their list"" (at which point he hung up when I said ""yes"").<p>I found this via googling: http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/dmfs.shtm<p>What I want to know: does anyone know the actual company name?

118484,comment,118129,118461,0,0,hobbs,,,"Just to clarify, I do find your original statement to be absolutely correct: ""Anyone who's good at anything knows that there's an inverse correlation between talking about it and being good at it."" The reason you have to explicitly say it, though, is that it goes against the grain of human behavior.<p>Being the type of person who actually does things without wasting time talking about it, I've had to learn the hard way that that's not what hiring managers look for. I would not trade my satisfaction of good work for money, but I've found that by spending a little more time on marketing skills rather than on programming skills, I can greatly improve my income.",1203375975
118483,comment,118437,118456,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Good point. Both arguments (mine regarding hosting your own blog, and yours) are quite valid.<p>I assume this means linking to it on your site. But if your server goes down, your users won't be able to get to it anyways, unless they have your blog address memorized or bookmarked.<p>Your site should never be allowed to go down for long, unless something major happens, in which case a backup plan is ideal. I would host my own blog, and if my server does go down, redirect the domain to a stable site with a brief explanation of what's going on, and then when every thing's back to normal post about it in the company blog.",1203375892

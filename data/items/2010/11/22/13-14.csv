You cannot prevent well motivated and capable attacker from launching unauthorized nuclear strike by purely technical means.<p>Well probably anything related to ""tamper proof"" security (defending against attacker who has full uncontrolled access to ""secure"" device) of anything is security by obscurity at best (security of such commercial products is often based on that each device uses unique configuration of countermeasures) and pure snake oil more often.<p>In this case whole security of this system really relies on people (and their belief that there are some technical security measures that they cannot trivially circumvent) and focusing on technical means too much would actually divert resources to something that is actually not possible to do perfectly. USAF probably correctly assumed that relying on people is better approach. I remember that some (probably DoD-sponsored, in relation to WMD security) study asserted that only meaningful way to protect system from well funded and motivated attackers is to not let such attackers near the system (presumably by means of guarding it).",1290434022

Even my Austrian friends who are from outside the city have the same problems. I've decided to give up.<p>It seems to be tied to a fear of novelty… people are too comfortable, but they complain about the advantages they have. Everything here is so goshdarn <i>nice</i> and even that it seems like people have lost the ability to ""stretch"" to deal with something new, different, or unexpected. (And sadly that seems to extend to people.) In fact, even their own emotions seem muted -- rather than excitement, or passion, or even hate, or joy, everything seems to be fairly even.  Simple example: it's very rare to find someone laughing in a restaurant or cafe, and if you do, others will stare.<p>This social posture seems to be a lot more common in Europe than in, say, the US. And more common yet again in the Germanic cultures (incl. Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, and most of Scandinavia) than in the Latin cultures.<p>Who knows if it's echoes from the war or something else.",1290433753

One of the key indicators that you've gone off the rails: your turnabout necessitates conceptual contortions in order to make a false equivalence.<p>In your post above, you falsely claim that the students are being accused of plagiarism.  They are not.  While plagiarism can be a kind of academic dishonesty, it is not the particular kind of academic dishonesty at issue here.  Then, to complete your false equivalence, you try to re-frame the <i>de rigueur</i> practice of drawing test items from an item bank as plagiarism, which is just laughable and ignores both the purpose of the test instrument and the different roles of student and teacher.<p><i>I contest that the professor is too.</i><p>The word ""contest"" in the above context means ""to oppose as mistaken or wrong"".

One requires focus on the needs of other people, the other require focusing on your own needs and riding over people.<p>Gender roles and families allow the existence of both emotional states within one entity - it is possible for a family to be made up of both a very human side and a very aggressive side. This maximises the success potential of a family unit - one half can be ambitiously working towards acquiring more, while the other can be ambitiously working towards building closer family ties and emotional support.<p>When both parts of the family are aggressively working towards acquiring more, the softness of a family gets lost. There is less emotional dependence, less of one person doing one thing, and more of two people who have a lot of potential to be at loggerheads with one another.<p>Raising a family and acquiring a lot of money require completely different emotional outlooks, and I believe that there are not many people who can make the switch from roughriding for money to being tender at home.<p>Families need two different people fulfilling different roles to be successful. That's the evolutionary method, that's the method that is culturally agnostic and that has taken us as humans this far. Intellectually trying to force a different system to exist is causing unhappy societies and break-ups of family units that used to be happy.<p>When couples say the other half completes them, they mean that the other person fills in some parts that they lack, they don't mean that the other is exactly the same as they are.",1290433580

All the <i>really</i> sharp devs I know here in Bangalore  have plenty of interesting and satisfying work to choose from and could move to the USA (or wherever) whenever they want. They just <i>choose</i> not to, which is a hard concept for people who'd kill to get on the H1B/Green Card/USA citizenship treadmill to wrap their heads around.<p>It is only the folks with somewhat ""generic"" skillsets that the bodyshoppers want, and with no unique knowledge or skill, who are really ""stuck"" in the outsourcing jobs and (in some cases) desperate to move on to some unarticulated ""better job"". And in most such cases the ""better job"" <i>is</i>  management. Why waste time hacking on some nightmare enterprise legacy codebase no one in the West wants to work on anymore when you can politick and attend meetings and send meaningless emails for thrice the money? If I were working in some soulless ""offshore development centre"" I'd be a manager too. It is the lesser evil.<p>Even outside the bodyshopping fraternity there are a lot of people here who talk a lot about the latest kool aid fads - agile, lean startups, functional programming,what have you, but very few people who can actually get stuff done or code up something interesting or value providing. The folks who <i>can</i> are swimming in opportunity.<p>As  Alex Feinberg (strlen here on HN) commented here the other day ""Specialized knowledge is how you make your way out of the enterprise/web ghetto and onto much more fascinating problems"". The ""enterprise/web ghetto"" is where all the outsourcing critters swim and there are plenty of warm bodies competing for those jobs. No Indian dev with any kind of specialized knowledge lacks for opportunity.<p>My <i>personal</i> belief is that if you have access to the internet and can afford a cheap laptop to install Linux on, your only limits on achievement (in software) are those you impose on yourself. And many Indian devs do impose many social limitations on themselves (""I want a 'good' arranged marriage"" heh heh) which are fulfilled in dead end jobs and not in the riskier but more interesting opportunities.<p>There is nothing really stopping a guy in India from building good software. Sure you have to work harder/smarter if you are not in Silicon Valley/don't have an American passport/whatever but so what? The world was never ""fair"" in an absolute sense.<p>(I hope that wasn't too harsh but imho many Indian devs whine too much about lack of opportunity and don't code/learn  enough).",1290432842

What I have noticed with most of my friends and classmates around me is that they aren't putting in the full footwork or effort to seem qualified for the positions they are applying for. They are sending their resumes blindly to openings, and they are not getting called back. Then they whine that they didn't get called back. Never do they take proactive steps towards figuring out why. Learn to hack the system. There are numerous creative and interesting ways to get a job. Figure. it. out.",1290430973

At Goldman, it has been reported, nearly a thousand employees received bonuses of at least a million dollars in 2009.\nNot surprisingly, Wall Street has become the preferred destination for the bright young people who used to want to start up their own companies, work for NASA, or join the Peace Corps. At Harvard this spring, about a third of the seniors with secure jobs were heading to work in finance.

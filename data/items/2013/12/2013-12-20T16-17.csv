I simply meant to debunk that claim if it exists.<p>I thought it was brilliant because Gilad provides a humble deconstruction of common myths and claims of the FP culture. He is skeptical and I didn&#x27;t find any of his conclusions to be dismissive: he walks through the reasoning behind his opinions. I certainly didn&#x27;t find any point where I thought he was ignorant of the subject of which he was speaking. And if you listen to his opening remarks about &quot;deconstruction,&quot; and his conclusion do note that he points out some FP concepts that are useful and should be exploited more. He was there to break through the hype and I think he was successful.",1387558752

I like to think of assertions as patterns that match the space between two characters. So (?!a) means that it matches the space, where the next character is not &#x27;a&#x27;.<p>So in this case, your regex matches an empty string (since it doesn&#x27;t match any character at all between ^ and $, only spaces.)<p><pre><code>  >  ^((?!(.)(.)\\3\\2).)∗$\n  >  1.

I have a spectrum of confidence when it comes to science, and the more its conclusions are reached under solid empiricism, the higher that level of confidence.<p>If the cause was not observable, then it is completely and totally rational to take one&#x27;s level of confidence down a few notches.  After all, we&#x27;re not able to observe HALF of the cause--(produces)-->outcomes process.<p>The existence of the sun is not hypothetical, because its existence is on the right side of that process - it&#x27;s an &quot;already happened&quot; outcome that is routinely confirmed by the senses daily.<p>The discussion about what caused the sun&#x27;s existence is irrelevant to the vast amounts of present knowledge that can be gained from empirically observing it in the here-and-now.

6942363,comment,6941171,6942052,68,0,throwaway83294,,,"You have no idea. I was &quot;friends&quot; with someone for years, who at the time I didn&#x27;t know was a psychopath (over time I realized they met literally every item on the psychopathy checklist). The manipulativeness, the ability to lie completely sincerely (I bet a lie detector test would show absolutely nothing), and absolute and utter lack of remorse is terrifying, in a way.<p>The most striking thing, in retrospect, is the manipulative talent they have, and how relentlessly and patiently they are to go for the &quot;long con&quot;.<p>In my case, I happen to be very talented at programming and computer science. The psychopath (who has no particular scientific talent) I refer to found me, and basically befriended me and over time convinced me to work some 100+ hour weeks on an entrepreneurial project building prototypes. This would ordinarily be fine if the profit was split evenly, but only in retrospect did I realize the disparity of my persuaded reality from their distortion field versus actual reality -- i.e. this person took 100% credit for my work, and was sure to leave no evidence that I did anything so there was nothing I could do.<p>But that&#x27;s not even the persuasive part. The persuasive part was when I brought this up with my &quot;friend&quot;, saying &quot;hey so I noticed you&#x27;re taking complete credit for this with no mention of me&quot; or something of that sort. I don&#x27;t even remember the details, but this person masterfully diverted attention in such a way that I found it not important, and thought about other things.<p>Ultimately over time, I noticed all the little disparities (lies, deception, hints of absolute lack of remorse) and had a pretty good suspicion that this person was a psychopath. It was only when I caught him in a completely undeniable lie that it all exploded.<p>The excuses given when confronted were pretty impressive at the time, but I&#x27;m not stupid, and it was pretty clear he was struggling to come up with answers when confronted. The strangest thing though was despite me having hard and undeniable evidence, to this day he would refuse to admit the lie, and in fact tried to convince me to apologize for slandering him (despite him knowing very well I have conclusive evidence).<p>Then I let on I knew he was a psychopath. The change in personality was dramatic, creepy, and like something out of a horror movie. You don&#x27;t know this person, but normally he has a very persuasive, seductive (in a non sexual way), and extremely socially charming and polite personality. When you&#x27;re around him, he makes everyone feel good about themselves (part of his strategy to get people to follow him and do what he wants is making them addicted to feeling good about themselves around him).<p>But after he knew I knew, things were different. The attitude DROPPED completely. He had a stone cold expression, no emotion in his voice, and the coldest eyes and voice tone you could imagine. There was only one emotion he showed when I revealed I knew, and it was terror. Deep, deep terror he was struggling to conceal. This made the situation all the more creepy, because this person is characterized by being completely fearless (as is typical of psychopaths), but I suspect if it&#x27;s one thing that scares a psychopath, it&#x27;s being found out -- which btw is why this article from the OP is so remarkable (though no doubt it&#x27;s just an attempt at manipulation, if you know anything about psychopaths). But beyond the terror you could see, there was nothing -- just pure cold and calculating rational self-serving thought. He immediately terminated a multiple year &quot;friendship&quot; without even a thought, and distanced himself from me after he realized I could not be persuaded and distorted into thinking I was wrong and imagining things.<p>Since then we&#x27;ve crossed paths only a few times, and you can tell he&#x27;s still afraid of being revealed. He&#x27;s doing well though in business as you would expect of a psychopath, climbing the social ladder very quickly to a future of possible fortune.<p>I should add that it is indeed a common misconception that psychopaths are cold blooded killers. The reality is in some ways much more scary. The stupid ones perhaps kill, but they eventually get caught. The smart ones are leeches on society, who have no regard for anything but their own animalistic desires of power, control, and inflated ego.<p>Also, having been &quot;friends&quot; with a psychopath gives an interesting perspective on other well-known figures. Though I  never met him, I am convinced Steve Jobs is pretty high on the psychopathy spectrum. What&#x27;s interesting is that Jobs accomplished something valuable to society, though not without leaving a trail of damage in his wake. The psychopath I met also has a strong motivation to make an impact in the world, to be known almost as a hero, no doubt to satisfy desires of ego and power. So perhaps society&#x27;s social structure can work for good and turn the desires of a psychopath towards good (but unfortunately it can also work in reverse). So in a way, I think psychopaths aren&#x27;t all inherently leeches on society if what they accomplish is positively impactful to it.<p>But you see... the scariest part of having encountered a psychopath is it&#x27;s sometimes very difficult to know if that last thought is my own, or something I was persuaded to think.",1387558592

6942304,comment,6941384,6942240,12,0,rayiner,,,"School funding is a red herring. In the Washington Metro area, D.C. and Baltimore spend $19k/year and $15k/year per pupil, versus $13k/year for Fairfax County. Yet, any parent would rather send their kids to Fairfax County public schools rather than D.C. or Baltimore public schools.<p>What encourages people to flee the city when they have a kid is that urban liberals are incredibly hostile to the idea of allowing school boundaries to be drawn along socioeconomic lines. Middle class parents don&#x27;t just want to send their kids to schools that are adequately funded (as schools in most major cities certainly are), but to schools where the other kids are from families like themselves. They don&#x27;t want their kids being influenced by kids whose dads are in jail for drug dealing. That&#x27;s the politically-incorrect reality of parenthood. They can get this in the suburbs, but cities make it extremely difficult and expensive to do this.<p>For example, until recently San Francisco had this wonderful (from a social progress point of view), but terrible (from a parenting and urbanism point of view), policy of not having &quot;home&quot; schools based on geographic location, but incorporating some element of lottery selection. The net result was that middle and upper class people couldn&#x27;t pick their schools by moving to a particular neighborhood. Of course, this created a tremendous incentive to just leave the city, and even ultra-liberal san francisco was recently forced to end the policy.<p>The problem is that school policy has been hijacked by teachers, so the debate always revolves around &quot;more money.&quot; But throwing lots of money at a school where 75% of kids don&#x27;t have a father in their lives isn&#x27;t going to help those kids learn. Throwing money at things like Section 8, which might let those families move to suburbs where they can go to a school where they aren&#x27;t surrounded by that culture, <i>that</i> could really push forward the cause of social progress.",1387558058

He took it upon himself to be my friend and mentor. The first few months were fine. I go along with everyone and did a good job. This was his information gathering phase. I&#x27;m an open person so he learned a lot about me before the red flags went up.<p>He slowly began praising me, saying I was uniquely qualified for the job and the other guys weren&#x27;t doing it right. He and I would show them how it was done. His charm and intelligence won me over and I was very flattered.<p>Simultaneously, he began turning everyone against me, making me dependent upon him. Feeling isolated, I found myself drawn closer into his orbit. I began suspecting him, but I found myself drawn like a moth to a flame to his charisma, praise and intelligence.<p>He had all the people in positions of authority fooled, so they trusted him. He began telling them without my knowledge that I wasn&#x27;t very good at my job but he would look out for me.<p>If I deviated from what he wanted, no matter how small, his punishment was severe. I went to the authorities about this but they just shrugged their shoulders.<p>When I realized what was going on and being a computer person (this was when I was taking a break from a programming career), I managed to delve into the computer system and show with facts how he was cheating and how I was actually doing as well or better than the others. He responded by convincing them my computer skills were dangerous. They restricted my access to the database. He received a minor punishment because he was popular.<p>By cheating (and actually breaking the law in some cases) he managed to receive outstanding performance reviews. When the big bosses came to town he was recognized for his outstanding performance. He made sure to tell them I was a basket case that he was trying to bring along.<p>I began asking around about him. I found out he always wore long sleeve shirts to hide his prison tattoos. I foolishly thought I could fight him, so I found other ways to bring his cheating to light. This went no where because the other employees and management were afraid of him.<p>When he couldn&#x27;t beat me outright, he enlisted a confederate to sabotage my work. With my guard up, I became very adept at justifying my work and proving I wasn&#x27;t in the wrong.<p>I began noticing how he faked emotions. For example, he was essentially humorless, but he could fake a laugh that when you thought about it, was obviously fake and looked maniacal.<p>I became worn out, depressed and sick. I left the company. They all thought I was a &quot;nice guy&quot; and said they liked me and I believe they meant it, but thought it was to bad I wasn&#x27;t up to the job.  This was his end game, for the simple fact that he liked the company to be short handed so he could collect more over-time. I believe he actually liked me, but he liked the money more.<p>To answer your question: The psychopaths I&#x27;ve met are charming, intelligent, popular with people in authority. They get a free pass that others get punished for. You&#x27;ll see how they cheat but never get in trouble for it and notice how other people are afraid of them.

This drives up the price of housing.<p>On the welfare policy side, American states corral all their poor people into their large cities. In Manhattan, riverfront property might be dedicated either to expensive condos (upper west side), or public housing (lower east side). The suburbs, for their part, go to great lengths to prevent the introduction of services for lower-income people.<p>In most cities, #2 is a bigger problem than #1. If you&#x27;re willing to compromise on space, living in the suburbs often isn&#x27;t dramatically cheaper. In theory, getting a 1,500 square foot house would be cheaper in the suburbs versus the city, but suburban municipalities tend to discourage the construction of smaller houses, so often the choice is between 1,500 square feet in the city, or 3,000 square feet in the suburbs, at not altogether dissimilar prices factoring in the cost of commuting and cars.<p>The biggest problem is schools. In most places, you have to pay for public schools even if you send your kid to private school. And public schools in cities are almost uniformly terrible, not because public schools in cities must intrinsically be terrible, but because as a result of #2, urban school districts are 90%+ low-income. Putting a bunch of poor kids all together in the same school is not a recipe for success. People like to paint it as a funding problem, but its a socioeconomic demographics problem. In Illinois, schools inside Chicago spend almost 40% more per student than schools outside Chicago, but perform far below those outside the city.<p>Now of course, even the most progressive parents aren&#x27;t willing to send their children to schools where 90% of the kids come from welfare homes, disproportionately don&#x27;t have fathers, etc. And they don&#x27;t want to pay $10,000 per year (for parochial schools), or $20,000+ (for non-religious schools) to send their kids to private schools. So they move to the suburbs, where they can send their kids to socioeconomically homogenous public schools, and take advantage of the services for which they&#x27;re paying for anyway.<p>I think the confluence of these factors is really unfortunate, and has an unfortunate impact on American families. First, I think it discourages people who might want kids from having kids. Second, it robs kids of the wonderfully enriching experience of living in cities, in close proximity to other people.",1387556762

That&#x27;s not luxurious, but for zero work at all that&#x27;s a much better outcome than someone who was born with nothing not working at all.

Some feedback based on my very limited experience:<p>First, SHA-1 should be used with the HMAC construction. HMAC is very easy to implement, see RFC 2104. Your developers can do it in a day. You can also use Keccak instead, it does not require HMAC, and there is a version with 224-bit output.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t see a problem with IGE. Despite others calling it &quot;ancient,&quot; it was proposed at about the same time as CBC. There is a proof of security against adaptive chosen plaintext attacks. Nonetheless, you could use a more studied mode like CTR, but most importantly use the encrypt-then-MAC composition, i.e. AES-CTR + HMAC. (An authenticated mode would be best, but GCM is not easy to implement.)<p>Finally, the DHKE really must be authenticated. Everything else depends on it, since the key (auth_key) is not ephemeral.

The law is hardly a useful tool, given how &quot;flexible&quot; and corrupt it is, and how money aka power is so important in manipulation of the law versus &quot;truth&quot;.  Economists aka amateur sociopaths are finally beginning to realize an obvious truth - that most humans are not rational actors strictly concerned with profit and loss but that decisions are based on emotion much more than they&#x27;d like to admit and so this has a significant effect on economic behavior.<p>All this does matter because ask yourself - what of the effects these people have on the lives of those they exploit?  what sort of setbacks do the good people end up facing and how much of a drain is it on their lives and their efforts to -contribute- to society as a whole?  I see so much waste because of the unnecessary chaos the sociopathic introduce to society as a whole.  They are a threat and capital punishment is a logical response, because they can not be rehabilitated.  But given how society is organized, rich white people are never going to be executed, or even prosecuted, for their crimes unless they&#x27;re so egregious they can&#x27;t be ignored.<p>Even then, the case of Jimmy Savile (in the UK) is an example of how humanity still is little nothing more than talking chimpanzees who respond more to and are controlled by instinctual behavior patterns versus the ability to cogitate like &quot;we&quot; think we are able to.  Jimmy was a sociopath, everyone knew he was a pedo, but nothing was done because no one wanted to speak up because of the social cost.  Things are better these days, of course, so maybe in another 100 years, there will be a test toddlers are given to track whether they are likely to be sociopathic, and more effort will be put into preventing the development of such evil monsters.  It is like the Head Start program in the States - prevent issues down the road by ensuring children have the best psychological foundation established as early as possible.",1387556136

But, historically, the only time meaningful change has happened is when there was overwhelming social pressure.

Only in such times has the establishment allowed any sort of concession.<p>I believe the odds of activism like this stopping fracking companies is actually very good. Which is why they are being met with police brutality. Suppose fracking protestors can reduce the likelihood of fracking companies to get local land exploitation permits from 95% to 90%, then that is a huge win and will save many wildlife areas.<p>It may not be &quot;meaningful change&quot; in the large scheme of things, but wins in many small fights compound and leads to bigger changes.

For some reason, eBay logs you out completely every time you restart the browser (whether or not you check the &quot;stay connected&quot; checkbox). Curiously, the page says &quot;hello {my name}&quot; but I still need to reconnect to do anything, and when I do, I have to retype my email address!! If the system can remember my name why can&#x27;t it remember my email address?? (This is the most annoying detail imaginable, probably because it seems so easy to fix).<p>2. Product descriptions are a mess; they usually contain many pictures but the text is more about what the buyer NEEDS TO DO AND VARIOUS OTHER WARNINGS IN ALL CAPS (and red font) than about the product itself. I feel like I&#x27;m being yelled at by an angry cop every time I read those.<p>3. Paying is a pain. Buying and paying are two very different events on eBay, whereas they&#x27;re just one and the same on Amazon. You have to go to Paypal (completely different website -- eBay owns Paypal, can&#x27;t they integrate it to the main eBay site??) and then you get a deluge of emails (around 4 I believe, sometimes more when the seller decides to write too).<p>4. Sellers are often unprofessional and obnoxious. They send you emails telling you to rate them 5 stars and that &quot;FOUR STARS = FAILURE&quot;; they add a paper saying the same thing in the package; they very rarely respond to emails; shipments are made via non-traceable systems.<p>5. Products are of uncertain quality; some are very good and some are cheap rip-offs (but it&#x27;s hard/impossible to tell from the product description).<p>I would very happily pay 30% more (or even 100% more for some products that are very cheap anyway) to shop on Amazon vs. eBay; I can&#x27;t understand how they&#x27;re still in business (it can&#x27;t just be me buying a couple of filter adapters for GoPro cameras, can it?)",1387556053

That&#x27;s portability that&#x27;s hard to beat. Considering you can also compile Java applications for iOS now, and of course Android as well, JVM-based languages are remarkably portable, and I&#x27;d argue that they are more portable than C.<p>The reasons for using C IMHO, is that it&#x27;s fast, memory efficient, doesn&#x27;t do any magic (like GC and JIT compiling and whatnot), and that it doesn&#x27;t require warmup to be fast. It is however slower to develop in, and the language is inherently unsafe.<p>Last but not least, it&#x27;s important to use the right tool for the right job.

Rust, on the other hand, is meant for low-level programming and as such tends to be very explicit about what it&#x27;s doing at every step. I think Rust and Haskell happen to share some similarities but ultimately they&#x27;re just not designed for the same purpose. Nothing wrong with learning both :)<p>Side-note, Idris is a Haskell-inspired pure language which is strict by default.

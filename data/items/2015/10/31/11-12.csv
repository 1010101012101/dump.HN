Just think about the sheer number of economic decisions occurring every day. Going to store A instead of store B. Picking brand A over brand B. Walking two kilometers instead of calling a taxi. Picking your holiday destination. Researching suppliers for components for a new product. Cancelling a no longer profitable product. Doing market research. Changing the price of a product. And the list goes on forever.<p>How could you ever faithfully reconcile all those decisions into a manageable number of votes? If you stranded with five people on a remote island you could probably pull this off, but in any realistic setting this seems totally out of reach to me.<p>I am totally not happy with capitalism as we have it, but the thing that actually works really well are markets. Surely markets can fail if there are monopolies, if actors collude, if there are externalities not reflected by the price and so on and this can lead to socially suboptimal or plain bad outcomes but often they work really well.

I think that Dotcom refers to the fact that the &quot;webpages&quot; or whatever they&#x27;re going to serve are not hosted on a specific IP but are instead distributed in the blockchain; and he talks about IP because either a) he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about or b) he&#x27;s oversimplifying a lot. In any case, the MegaNet would run over IP because no ISP is going to let non-IP protocols go through their networks.<p>- Using mobile phones. Even when on WiFi, that&#x27;s going to eat batteries for breakfast: users aren&#x27;t going to like that. And another issue: MegaNet traffic would still go through traditional ISPs, so they would probably be able to filter it.<p>Another point is that Android, iOS and Windows Phone have closed, controlled stores. That&#x27;s going to make it difficult for them to implement.<p>- Using the blockchain. I don&#x27;t know why would they use the blockchain, which is a method to ensure integrity over time (e.g., you don&#x27;t spend two times the same bitcoin). What would would make sense to use P2P webpages, like BitTorrent&#x27;s Maelstrom does [1]. Maybe they use the blockchain so they can keep a correct history of a certain webpage, who knows. Another option is that they are thinking of using the authentication part of the blockchain, but one could do that with Maelstrom using PGP signed pages, for example.<p>In any case, they&#x27;d face significant issues. For example, they would be introducing useless delays when creating/updates webpages (blockchain relies on proofs of work to avoid malicious nodes to insert duplicate/forged transactions). But if they make the verification process fast, they would be more vulnerable to malicious nodes.<p>Another problem would be how to store the information they want to transmit. The blockchain works because the information in each transaction is just a few bytes long. However, a webpage is way bigger than that. How do they store not only the current versions of the webpages, but the old ones too? I don&#x27;t think the combined storage of mobile phones is enough to hold all that information. Maybe they could use deltas, but that&#x27;s only going to make browsing slower (instead of one block, you&#x27;d need to retrieve several to reconstruct the page) and they would not avoid completely the problem: what if the difference between versions is too big? E.g., encrypted pages: deltas would be useless then.<p>- &quot;New layer of encryption that will run through all digital communications&quot;. Well good luck with that.<p>- &quot;We are going to use very long keys, systems that will not be reverse engineered or cracked by any supercomputer&quot;. Long keys imply long encrypt times too. With phones, and probably with several communications with several different nodes. That&#x27;s going to be interesting.<p>- &quot;If you have 100 million smartphones that have the MegaNet app installed, we&#x27;ll have more online storage capacity, bandwidth and calculating power than the top 10 largest websites in the world combined&quot;. Distributed computing doesn&#x27;t work like that. You don&#x27;t just &quot;add up things&quot;. Yeah, you may have terabits per second of bandwidth combined, but using single nodes that maybe can get up to 1Mbps. You have a lot of processing power but have to distribute any computation through a lot of nodes because no one has enough single computing power to do complex tasks fast. And you have 100 million smartphones distributed through the world: good luck with the latency and reliability of the connections.<p>In any case, I think this is either going to be a Maelstrom clone or a complete bluff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/</a><p>Edit: added a few points.",1446290149

10482359,comment,10482209,10482338,0,0,morganvachon,,,"> I guess the suspects should not go to the same place as the convicts.<p>By and large, they don&#x27;t. Suspects go to county or city jail, not prison, to wait for bail or their court date. Convicted persons go to prison.<p>The issue is that a large, and growing, percentage of the pre-trial jail population is repeat offenders, people who <i>have</i> been to prison and therefore the jail environment begins to resemble the prison environment. In the county where I work, with a total population of nearly 1 million people, the jail houses about 2300 inmates on a regular basis. Those inmates are classified and housed based on a number of factors, including the type and severity of their current charges, their criminal history, direct observation by medical and psychological staff, age and infirmity, and so on.<p>Still, even with this sensible approach to keeping the &quot;hardcore&quot; inmates away from those accused of minor crimes, occasionally someone who has never seen the inside of a jail before ends up in a cell or dorm with career criminals. There&#x27;s no easy solution, but proper classification and staff education go a long way towards keeping pre-trial jails safer for the accused.<p>As for the subject of this article, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how high his bond was set for that particular charge, given that most bonding companies typically charge no more than 15% of the total bond amount. Even if his bond was $10,000 (which would be consistent with the charge here in Georgia, but of course NYC may be drastically different), the fee to a professional bondsman would be $1500, something his family and friends could scrape together. Even if his bond was set higher than that, he could have petitioned the judge for a reduced bond or even a ROR (released on his own recognizance) bond, given the non-violent nature of the offense and the fact he&#x27;s never had a felony conviction.<p>No, it sounds like a big part of the problem is apathy on the part of the public defender&#x27;s office in NYC, coupled with district attorneys who care more about conviction rates than actual justice and judges who are nothing more than rubber stamp machines.",1446289865

10482357,comment,10481752,10482308,0,0,logicchains,,,"It depends how you define &quot;socially optimal&quot;.<p>A key notion of economics is that if two people voluntarily agree to something, it must be of some benefit of them at that moment compared to alternatives else they wouldn&#x27;t have agreed. A market can consist solely of such interaction. A democracy on the other hand involves people via votes controlling what other people can and can&#x27;t do (in a market context, reducing their control over what, how and to whom they can exchange their labour and products thereof), which necessarily entails some kind of loss (in terms of otherwise-realised unrealised preference) from the people who are not able to do what they&#x27;d be doing absent coercion by the democracy&#x27;s enforcers.<p>Pure free-market economics adopts the epistemological stance that utility (the economic proxy for value, based roughly on the notion of value being defined as the sum of people&#x27;s realised preferences) isn&#x27;t quantifiable, so no potential utility gained from the results of the democratic thwarting of some people&#x27;s preferences can outweigh the definite loss from those people not realising their preferences.<p>Other schools of economics do view utility as quantifiable, so it&#x27;s possible to say that there can be a net benefit from interfering with someone&#x27;s preferences based on the result of democratic process. They disagree however in how utility is best quantified.<p>Schools of thought external to economics often have measures of value that differ substantially from the economic notion of utility. In particular, any scheme that assumes the existence of moral absolutes is fundamentally incompatible with the notion of utility.<p>It&#x27;s hence important to consider that any economics that makes recommendations (that isn&#x27;t just econometrics/prediction) is necessarily based on some particular philosophical propositions regarding what&#x27;s valuable. Without this, economic discussion tends to degrade to people talking past each other because they have fundamentally different theories of value, fundamentally different metrics for the &quot;optimal&quot; in social optimality.<p>To put it another way, whether or not there is an optimal solution depends on how optimality is defined, so discussing solutions without defining optimality is pointless.",1446289813

2618918,comment,2616634,2618795,2,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"The issue is how fast the password can be broken. MD5 is a very fast hash, so even a relatively slow computer can do a <i>lot</i> of attempts very quickly.<p>Bcrypt, on the other hand, can be tuned to go as slow as you want. You can force it to take 250 milliseconds, regardless of how good or bad the password is.<p>And that is the fundamental flaw. Jungle Disk's key derivation makes it possible to crack your password in a reasonable time; bcrypt does not. Because of that decision, everybody's data is much less safe as a result (I'm referring to everybody's data in a statistical sense: the average password sucks and is easily broken in this scheme, so the average file is at risk).<p>As a provider of security software (like my company is doing), Jungle Disk should be doing everything it can to help users keep their data secure.

2618897,comment,2616184,2618255,3,0,thwarted,,,"<i>The thing I didn't (and still don't) like about the diagram is it implies the whole ""ls -l"" is delivered by the terminal emulator to the shell. Which isn't how it works. The emulator is transparent to all normal keystrokes and the shell is doing all the work, character by character, even for stuff like ctrl-H which, years ago, could have been (and sometimes was) intercepted and handled by the terminal driver.</i><p>I don't think it's as simple as this.  When the shell spawns a program, it gets out of the way and the program spawned receives all the input directly, the terminal intermediates, but the shell doesn't.  For example, if you want to turn off echo (the printing of the characters you type), you need to change the terminal settings.  This is done with <i>stty -echo</i> (go ahead and type that, you won't be able to see what you're typing), which communicates with the terminal driver to tell it to not print characters that are input.  This is how password prompts are done.<p>Witness:<p><pre><code>   $ od -c\n   hello<backspace><backspace><backspace><backspace><backspace><control-d>\n   0000000\n</code></pre>\n<i>od</i> sees no input.  The input was deleted by the terminal driver.  Usually, the terminal is in line-input mode, so this can happen.  Now, in my case, my backspace key maps to ^?, so to actually get a control-h from my backspace key, I had to do <i>stty erase ^H</i>.  Then, the above produces:<p><pre><code>   0000000   h   e   l   l   o 177 177 177 177 177\n</code></pre>\nbecause the backspace/erasure didn't occur at the terminal level (in fact, nothing got erased at all, nothing interpreted the input that way, and the input was passed to od plainly).  Note the output of <i>stty -a</i>.  There are a number of line editing control characters that modify the input <i>at the terminal level</i> before the program/shell ever even sees it.<p>You can see this with <i>strace -o /tmp/s.out -f bash</i> then running <i>od -c</i> in that shell, typing the above, erasing it, and seeing that neither bash wakes up to handle the input and od sees no input (od's only read shows up as returning zero bytes, indicating end-of-file).",1307162301

Two differences now: (a) national governments have started outsourcing to the second group more and also hyping the word 'cyber', leading to (b) the public has started to become mildly amused by these skirmishes.<p>4. Interesting configuration of actors there. For those in Europe or America, the interesting part of alleged Chinese hacking is the unwanted free transfer of lucrative IP, which is to say trade secrets. But the US government already has behind-the-scenes access to a vast amount of global internet traffic so any large scale spying effort on its part wouldn't need to be so overt as would that of, say, China. And China is certainly not alone in facing these allegations.[1]<p>5.

I just recently stopped taking Zoloft for bouts of depression that I've had for most of my life, but didn't realize until I finally hit rock bottom.<p>At the least, you should see a psychiatrist and request to be put on antidepressants. However, there is a slight chance it may increase your suicidal thoughts, so if you decide to go this route to quell the depression, you will need to closely monitor your thoughts and contact your psychiatrist if you feel like you want to kill yourself.<p>That being said, like I said before, I just recently stopped taking my antidepressants. They helped pick me up, but I wouldn't be where I am today (copywriter for a rapidly expanding Internet marketing company in Tempe, AZ) if I didn't dive head first into something I was passionate about (i.e writing foremost, and all things tech, second).<p>So, you should sit down and write down a list of all the things you like to do. Make it comprehensive. Then go through it one-by-one and ask yourself whether you could wake up every day happy to go into work to do whatever item is on your list. Ask yourself whether you'd feel accomplished and good about what you do. Put a check mark next to those you answer in the affirmative to and then go through the check marked items and narrow it down until you find 1 to 2 things that you are super passionate about.<p>Once you find those, start mapping out a way to secure jobs in those areas. Whatever you do... don't sit at home and seclude yourself. Seclusion, in my book, will 100% lend itself to suicide if it continues for long enough.<p>Sorry for the long-winded response, but I've been in your position to an extent and I have a friend who suffers from bipolar 2 and he hasn't sought help and he continues to spiral downwards. If I can, I'd like to play some part in helping you get back on your feet.<p>If you want to talk, hit me up at houston.barnettgearhart@gmail.com. I'll respond whenever I get the chance.",1307160533

The decision making process in Python is fair and egalitarian. It's useful to have a ""dictator"" to give the final rule on difficult decisions every once in a while, because we all are engineers who get bogged down in design alternatives which don't always end up being conclusive. Guido has never really forced himself on the community. Sure, any new ideas he brings to the table will be taken more seriously, but so would ideas brought by other senior core-devs. It's a meritocracy, after all!",1307160297

It was a separate project, initially created to address a particular shortcoming of Rails (file uploads, IIRC), and grew into a competing implementation that solved a lot of the same problems that Rails did in a simpler, more elegant way. The Rails core team realized that Merb did a lot of things better and absorbed most of that goodness.<p>SlimGems isn't Merb. It's not new, it's not doing anything better. The only thing it has going for it is ""Hey, it's not being run by these same assholes."" Well, that doesn't help me much. SlimGems isn't going to ship with Ruby 1.9.3, and it doesn't solve any problems that RubyGems doesn't solve.

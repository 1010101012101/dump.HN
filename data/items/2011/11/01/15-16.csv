3182646,comment,3181177,3182085,6,0,agentultra,,,"<i>Programmer sounds like anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.  If you call yourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired.</i><p>That sounds derogatory to me. His opinion is that business types could care less about what you do. You're not a <i>programmer</i> but an exploitable resource. Since when is being a crafts-person and being proud of your work and what you do bad?<p><i>I get that you're proud of your development skills, but at some point your software has to solve a business need, and you need to understand what the need is and how your software is solving it.</i><p>I'm in the business of producing good software. How does calling myself a programmer have anything to do with what you just said?<p>It's a matter of perception. Patrick thinks people think programmers are clueless navel-gazing cogs who don't have a grip on reality. Of course nothing could be further from the truth -- a good programmer is probably more in touch with the needs of the business than the ignorant stakeholder who thinks programmers just type in a bunch of stuff. I think this perception is a disservice to both programmers and business people alike. I do not doubt that there are people in the world who perceive programmers in the way Patrick describes... but I wouldn't work for them for anything less than a big six-figure salary and very gracious vacation allowance. I think most people understand that programmers make software and software solves problems for businesses and consumers which makes money. Therefore programmers must be pretty important.<p>So yes, I still call myself a programmer. If I catch wind that the person interviewing me views me as a 'peon' I walk. If that's what they're looking for it's their loss. They can figure it out later I'm sure and might come back to me when their spending 80% of their time and budget fixing the errors their ""peon"" introduced into their software.<p>Good programmers are hard to find. I don't see anything wrong with calling myself a programmer.",1320163073
3182645,comment,3181681,3182418,2,0,NerdsCentral,,,"Totally agree. My original aim was to use an idea I had about the way the garbage collector synchronises in the Oracle JVM to give 'windows' of determinism. So I set about making a program to push the gc really hard so I could see if my idea worked. But I have not gotten as far as the original aim yet because I found this interesting stuff about the G1 collector.<p>As for your points about realtime - I am completely with you. I had in my mind that one might have a realtime system on the rtjvm or in c++ which needed to periodically communicate with a standard JVM. There are three approaches I could see for this. One, would be to send messages and decouple that way. Another is to make the communication abort if it looked like it might cause a deadline miss. The third was to briefly (milliseconds) disable the gc in the standard JVM so the communication could occur and then turn it back on again immediately afterwards.<p>Now - that sounds like a really bad idea and it probably is - but it is an interesting idea to play with.<p>So - please don't thing I am proposing realtime programming on the standard JVM, just some ideas for larger systems integration.",1320163071

Where as admitting a less well off student would run them $40-50k/year.\n* State schools generally end up giving their best deals to residents.\n* State schools have been dependent on tax revenues which have been ideological assault for the last few decades.

Surveyed afterward, they will both probably feel the other is stupid and didn't understand them on simple things.<p>I myself remember my first experience with someone at a call center, who I can only assume wasn't in the US. I was calling Network Solutions in high school about a domain registration. The person on the phone I recall as having an Indian accent, which I didn't mind so much, but I did feel at odd with them when I needed to spell my first name (David) out to them using the NATO phonetic alphabet. It just struck me as so incredibly odd at the time that someone would potentially mishear or misspell the name David. However, I quickly realized that it was simply a cultural difference. I myself would probably get a common Indian name like ""Sita"" wrong. Was that Seeta? Seta? Seata? Site? Its only 4 letters, but I could screw it up for sure. I've since been more understanding of people at support lines.<p>Just as people often say that racism is ignorance, I do have to feel that this wasn't me being against anyone from India (as I actually knew very few people who maintained much Indian culture, language or accent where I lived at the time), but being ignorant and impatient with what was normal for them vs what was normal for me.

3182588,comment,3181629,3181629,7,0,kstenerud,,,"Yeah, some people are genuinely racist, but the fact is that most aren't. What most people incorrectly call ""racism"" is actually culture fit issues.<p>When someone's culture is sufficiently different from yours, it becomes enough of an unknown to engender fear. And fear due to the unknown leads to paranoid thought, usually at the subconscious level.<p>For example, if you get a job candidate whose demeanor screams ""from the hood"", you'll definitely pass him/her over. The last thing you want is for them to start a fight over ""respect"", or bring some ""friends"" over to rob the place (deliberate hyperbole, yes, but this is how the subconscious works). Similarly, anyone who has had much contact with Indian culture will know that fraud and corruption are tolerated far more readily than they are in the West. This means that you need to be on your guard lest the person of that culture starts behaving as if in that culture. I've seen it happen enough times in my own experiences, so this is not just idle speculation. This is also why second gen people have a much easier time of it.<p>You may argue that you shouldn't ""sell out"" on your culture just to get ahead (""acting white"", for example). I would argue that in remaining ""true to your roots"", you hobble yourself by deliberately refusing to make it easier for the majority to accept you.<p>I've lived on both sides of this issue. I've seen actually racist people, but far more often I've seen people who are afraid of the cultural divide, and move to protect themselves accordingly. I've also seen people change their own culture to better match the one of the majority, and they made FAR better lives for themselves than those who refused to do so.<p>Do racism and sexism exist? Of course they do. And in the rare cases where you DO encounter the real thing, it is your duty as a civilized person to put a stop to it. But when it's merely a culture issue, raising a stink about it will do nothing more than stir up resentment.",1320162348

I've had to manually block ""unifiedpeople.ru"", ""mvp.itcommunity.ru"", ""boardreader.com"" and ""efreedom.com"" in order to clean up search results related to topics I'm regularly seeking answers.  They generally copy/paste from a variety of forums (and maybe even legally so), but they present a less up-to-date version than the site they're copying and often the code highlighting and other formatting is completely stripped rendering a very difficult to read result.  Yet they often rank higher than that from which they copied.<p>The sites are marginally useful and were a problem before and after Panda.  Google, being in a very powerful position, does have a lot of control over things like this, however, they also are going to be the most targetted.  I've found, in some cases, their closest competitor (the one that used to be very blue) occasionally provides cleaner results, especially if the query involves their own products--a circumstance that was not always the case.",1320161746

What would that process look like?<p>Maybe something like...The client hires you, you assess the requirements, send details to the translator and then all future project messages go straight to the translator (or a virtual assistant), you fix unusual/unique issues and issue the invoice. Rinse & repeat.<p>If you're entering into lengthy e-mail discussions try to find recurring topics/issues across all of your clients. Can you refine the requirements gathering process at the beginning of a project to save you time at the end?<p>Anticipate the standard number of hours needed for support and add a percentage onto your prices for ""support issues"". You can happily say this price also includes x amount of after-care.<p>If your client chooses not to have this added on up front you can say that unplanned support hours cost $xx. Knowing that your time is a premium ensures they are clear and concise with you from the start. Fixed price jobs are prone to requirements creep.<p>You're paying in so much time by reading long client e-mails, replying to them and then forwarding important info onto your translators. Maybe by discussing with a client on a recorded Skype call instead of e-mail you cut time needed down to 1/3.<p>Analyse your working day. Any repetitive task can be automated/outsourced made quicker or eliminated completely.<p>What types of task take up your day?<p>How long does it take to get your computer ready in the morning? Add programs to start-up, get frequently used websites saved to permanent tabs. Is filing paperwork/accounts simple? Any task over 10mins needs to be considered.<p>I know it sounds wrong but you've got to work yourself out of the business as a critical cog. You (i.e your time) are the bottleneck stopping you making more money.<p>Maybe having a virtual assistant for a few hours per day would be a low cost way of helping with communication back log. They could take info out of mails and forward to the translator working on it in a template. Or they could read mails and highlight the critical info for you consider.<p>It sounds as though your business is at a turning point where your job role needs to change to progress, move away from day to day work and more towards finding new clients and streamlining.<p>Your overall job is to remove obstacles for yourself and those that you employ.<p>Best of luck!!",1320161650

It just typically isn't, as such formal procedures are far more costly and slower than than just dealing with bugs as they happen.  For critical software systems like say avionics where a failure case is extremely costly (in both money and casualties), there do exist certification programs and rigorous methods as you describe for structural engineering.<p>It could be argued that avionics behaves more as engineering than as programming.  Then we have a self-fulfilling definition: if we define fields with rigorous procedures as engineering, and fields without as software development, then of course software development doesn't have formalized methodology.<p>You're also comparing the largest scope of structural engineering - a massive bridge - with the entire spectrum of software.  Engineering does happen on a smaller informalized scale too, like a homeowner building a shed or a Boy Scout troop building a rope obstacle course.

In the U.S., you do usually need engineers with P.E. certifications to sign off on a project, and in small firms it works like you describe. But in large corporations, there are typically <i>very</i> few people who do official sign-offs, often only the VP of Engineering or head of a project, who signs the final designs, and anything legally deposited with a government. And they usually don't do it purely on their own professional judgment, but only after consultation with the legal department.<p>As a result, very few engineers actually have jobs with sign-off authority/responsibility. Even if you do have a P.E. certification, unless you're very senior you'll probably never be officially signing off on anything as a regular employee. Below the top levels, almost all engineering jobs are structured as someone doing internal technical work for the corporation that gets passed upwards for eventual sign-off. That's part of what makes the engineering/technician boundary fuzzy, because nearly <i>everyone</i> is a technician by the classification you describe, in the sense of someone who doesn't independently sign off on engineering work (I do agree that engineering involving more design work is a common differentiator, though).",1320161307

Also, using a garbage-collected language in a real-time environment would require some extra care.<p>One of the things to consider in engineering a real-time environment is what is the central data-flow load of the system.  For example, in a medical data-acquisition environment, allocating an object for each tick would not likely be wise. In fact, use of malloc might not be called for, statically allocating buffers being a better avenue.<p>In the case of a low-latency financial trading system written in a garbage-collected language, it might be prudent to allocate all the objects before 0830 (if that is when trading starts) and free them after the market close.<p>There is a wide range of real-time response requirements (for financial exchanges, response times of less than a hundred of milliseconds (eg, 395 from BATS) for full turnaround are expected).  Electrocardiogram data needs to be sampled once each millisecond, but the jitter in sampling times needs to be low.<p>Looks like some good tools there, but without the engineering context it is hard to draw a useful conclusion.",1320160447

If the machine they're running is manifestly inefficient, they don't notice, or they pretend not to notice.<p>(Or  if they're good  they adapt <i>themselves</i>, adopting a complex series of difficult physical and mental moves to compensate for the machine's brokenness. Sometimes those physical moves are such that, after four years on the job, they'll be in the hospital. But they do them anyway, because, hey, making the inefficient machine work is their job.)<p>If the machine next to theirs is broken in a way such that it messes up half of the work coming out of <i>their</i> machine, they just keep going -- hey, it's their job to run <i>this</i> machine, not <i>that</i> machine. If the machine they're running breaks down, they call for help and then sit there unmoving until help arrives. (""I didn't want to break anything."")<p>You tell them to RTFM, and they do, all of it, and then they come back to you: ""I read the whole manual; now what do you want me to do?""<p>They may have even <i>memorized</i> the manual. It's not that these people aren't smart and eager to please. Indeed  and this is the thing I have trouble getting my head around  sometimes, within their area of expertise, they may know how to <i>tinker like mad</i>, they know the freaking <i>serial numbers</i> of every part of their machine and which ones can substitute for each other in an emergency. And yet, beyond their area, there's this strange paralysis. You hand them the duct tape and gesture encouragingly at a neighboring machine and... nothing happens.<p>If you give such a person a room full of miscellaneous broken things and ask them to fix everything they will proceed at a rate of (1 + epsilon) hour of progress per hour <i>you</i> spend telling them what to do. On the flip side, if you give them a room full of ten thousand widgets to finagle and they have a certification in Widget Finagling, those widgets will get finagled. They might even work overtime to please you. And when the widgets are done they'll go home, <i>even if the rest of the factory is on fire</i>, because there's nothing left for them to do.<p>When hiring someone to solve our problems we desperately need to know whether or not we're getting a hacker, or a technician. Both have their roles, but they can't substitute for each other.",1320159883
3182358,comment,3180397,3180712,2,0,pixelcort,,,"> I'd also point out that CouchDB's biggest feature, the must-have feature no other NoSQL repo besides RavenDB replicates, is the master-master replication. If you don't need that, your barrier to entry with the other NoSQL solutions is much easier/straight forward.<p>The other unique feature is incremental MapReduce. If you need to transform your mostly unchanging data in a way more complex than a mere attribute index, the ability for CouchDB to reuse parts of the last MapReduce operation is very convenient.<p>Of course, if you want to do any transormations beyond one set of map and reduce operations, you're on your own. I think only [Twister][1] does iterative MapReduce at the moment, although I'm not sure if it is incremental or not.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.iterativemapreduce.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iterativemapreduce.org/</a>",1320159867

While it's true that government usually turns out to be an instrument used by the powerful to control the powerless, it is undeniable that the rule of law has occasionally functioned well enough to protect a minority from a majority. It offers a framework with at least the possibility of protecting the powerless. Take away that framework, and the faction with the biggest guns will win. People forget that even in the US, in the early 20th century large corporations used lethal force wielded by their own private mercenaries to keep an oppressed worker population under control. If government had no power, these gatekeepers could do whatever they wanted without the hassle of approval and public debate.",1320159863

If you take money out of the picture, those incentives will still exist, and still convey political advantage.  Who dominates politics then, if not the wealthiest?  The most well-connected?

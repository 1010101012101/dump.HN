1254682,comment,1254113,1254570,0,0,blasdel,,,"You're absolutely right, it's a shame that Palm is essentially dead walking. Google's ChromeOS will be picking up the torch of ""everything's a tab"" when it hopefully ships later this year.<p>Apple hasn't yet backed themselves into a corner where they can't rip it off, but to do it right would require them to not be their usual bossy selves.<p>In an ideal card-based iPhone world, apps would have the option of being document-centric and be able to register for URL-handlers and file-types (both just like on OS X). Unfortunately the new Apple would probably never let them become the default in place of built-in apps (no registering <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>, no owning image/jpeg, etc.).<p>I think they'll have to do it eventually, but it might take a while. They might try to let the new multitasking API percolate in the wild first, and develop their replacement for the hierarchical filesystem UI and maybe OTA syncing in the meantime.",1270882747

They're creating an illusion that their software is better than (for example) Windows 7 by 4x if looking at the price.  That is a pretty hefty thing to claim.

1254650,comment,1254135,1254361,0,0,cheald,,,"My take on it is that Apple is attempting to splinter the developer community, and force you to pick sides - will you develop for the iPhone, or for those other platforms? By killing cross-platform compilers, they're attempting to force developers into a corner, where they have to pick a platform to commit to, and they're banking on their superior marketshare to cause developers to pick the iPhone.<p>If successful, it would put a significant dent in the viabilty of the Android platform. If Apple can give an ""us or them"" (or do it twice) ultimatum and get people to pick them (even grudingly), then they've won. The Mac desktop floundered against the PC for years due in no small part to the fact that all the developers were developing for Windows, and didn't really put much thought into cross-compatibility with Macs. Apple is attempting to repeat history, but with themselves on the other end of the equation this time.<p>It's a risky, ballsy, and brazen gambit, but if they pull it off (after all, the suits who write those developers' paychecks just care about the $ on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter), it could be a decisive turning point against Android. Jobs is obviously doing his best to water down the Android market (they have PORN! UNCLEAN!) and Apple is in full-on assault mode against Android (via HTC at the moment), and there's a very good reason for it - Android is suddenly a very real threat.<p>According to the February metrics from AdMob, Android has a marketshare equivalent to Apple's in the US. Apple still has a hefty lead worldwide, but Android is growing by leaps and bounds, while the iPhone remains stagnant. That's a very real and very direct threat that Apple is pulling out all the stops to counter.",1270880620

When you decide to make yourself dependent on someone else's product, and you don't get a formal partnership agreement from them, you are opening yourself up to disaster. And by no means should you expect the creator of that product to bend over backwards just to accommodate you. If you don't like their changes, or something they do interferes with your business, then leave. If you can't reasonably do that because you have inexorably linked your livelihood to that product, then that is no one's fault but your own.",1270880363

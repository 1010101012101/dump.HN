But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor&#x27; West Indian long before America was discovered.<p>gutenberg.org full text:<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm</a>",1392724366

That&#x27;s a race to the bottom. Site copy for a commercial site should be pitched at your customer&#x27;s level. A personal blog post should be written the way you want to write - it&#x27;s <i>your</i> voice. It&#x27;s okay to expect your audience to be of a given quality, or for them to stretch themselves a little to understand you fluently.

(Obviously I&#x27;m bound by an NDA, so I won&#x27;t go into specifics). You can think of this site like an oDesk/Freelancer competitor, but with some social features.<p>We also had another team from California working on this project, who consistently insisted that we go with Angular for a project of such complexity. Back then, on HN, everybody was writing about how awesome Angular is, and how you must use it for your next project and so on. It reminded me of the early MongoDB days here.<p>I was under constant pressure from my client too, since he was also reading a lot about Angular everywhere and the Californian company had him almost brainwashed in favor of angular. After already falling trap for the MongoDB buzz (I used MongoDB for the wrong use-case and suffered the consequences), I decided to carefully evaluate the decision to go with Angular for the project.<p>After about 6 months of using Angular for a different medium-scale project, I decided against it for my client. I realized that Angular is the all powerful Battle Tank. It can do everything you want it to. But it&#x27;s very tempting to choose a battle tank when all you need is a sedan to get you from home to office.<p>Angular has it&#x27;s own use-cases, but for the most part what I observed was that you could get a lot of mileage without using Angular, with just plain Jquery+Knockout (or any other similar framework of your choice) for most of the front-end.<p>In a simple calculation that I made (to pitch to my client), I estimated about easily 25% of time (and thus money) savings by not going with Angular for our project. (YMMV)<p>Usually I tend not to open my mouth about/against angular here because most HNers seem to like Angular a lot and they downvote without a reason just for having a different opinion. But, I am really glad someone wrote a blog post about this.",1392724166

Because the reason I joined a startup is for the direct responsibility to ship code and grow a product from zero to millions of users.  To do this I sacrificed joining a hugely successful company with many more resources where I could potentially climb quite quickly and make a huge salary without having to personally make a quantitative difference to the business.  Maybe I&#x27;m just more of an early-stage guy than you, but I assume that I&#x27;ll learn and progress my career based on the opportunities that come up.  I would be highly skeptical of management laying out a 3 year plan and how my job would evolve since by definition a startup does not know how they will find product-market fit.

(i.e. entering their creditcard, but not getting charged&quot;). I could reuse the params that we could store, and change the template id of the presented form, to have the form present my the users CC data.<p>>When faced with declining sales due to privacy fears, Kink (and many other sites) are shrugging off privacy concerns in order to make a buck off of invasive advertising<p>Those privacy concerns were never addressed in the first place.  \nReally common software to manage doorway sites, billing forms and affiliates is &quot;NATS, The Next-Generation Affiliate Tracking Software&quot; \nIt stores all passwords in plain-text in the database, while a year ago it had some updates on its styling.. like actually use CSS and tableless layouts... nothing changed in regards to security. Log files also contained huge amount of privacy sensitive data.<p>Another common practice was to never destroy user data, just make it not visible anymore when they opt out of their account. It will still hold resell value on the e-mail address alone.\nMy manager told me these could be worth $0.50 a piece for a validated e-mail address.<p>A lot of the things in the article are true.\nThe saturation of the market means that we had to take any effort to gain an edge. In the end this meant we were starting to run our own ads, and crunch the data to display better / different ads. When we got good at that, we started accepting other people to use our ad-network.\nCoincidentally the big money is in all the ad-networks.

All errors in interpretation are mine:<p>Jessica really likes Adora Cheung of Homejoy for having a very inspiring narrative.  (No specifics in this interview.)<p>First YC class: 8 companies, 400+ applications.<p>&quot;We have to do this in Silicon Valley [rather than Cambridge] because we didn&#x27;t want someone else to become the YC of Silicon Valley.&quot;  (Echoes the &quot;Uber will be the cheap Uber&quot; line.)<p>@8:25 &quot;No no no, I <i>know</i> you can make templated legal documents and just fill them in.&quot;  Mass-customized processes let them accomplish e.g. incorporation for less than $15k per company.<p>Ron Conway brushed me off 3 times.  We couldn&#x27;t describe ourselves as an accelerator because that concept didn&#x27;t exist yet.  Despite the brushoffs he was eventually convinced by multiple people in his network convincing him, so he came to Demo Day and the concept of YC then made a lot of sense to him.<p>&quot;What&#x27;s changed w/r/t YC applications over the years?&quot;  The Social Network / Facebook IPO caused a large spike in startups generally, but it&#x27;s been on an uptrend steadily for the duration.  Quality is harder to measure.  We get companies which are much later stage (existing product, signs of traction, evident ability to raise professional money) than the no-prototype folks who usually applied earlier.<p>&quot;Could YC 2x/3x in size?&quot;  We&#x27;re interested in scaling but don&#x27;t know the specifics of how to do so at the moment.  Number of startups will only increase; it is a fundamental shift in the economy.  YC&#x27;s early stage makes it incredibly difficult to accurately predict winners -- who would have called AirBNB and Dropbox [as turning into billion dollar businesses]?<p>&quot;You knew Drew was going to be successful with a 1600 SAT.&quot;  Many smart people apply to YC, but that doesn&#x27;t guarantee you get in.  Mere intelligence doesn&#x27;t make startups succeed.  Not that went to MIT is a bad predictor of success but it is certainly no guarantee.<p>&quot;Where are the international entrepreneurs coming from?&quot;  International increasing mainstream-ness of startups.  Not just from UK/Canada, but from (non-Anglosphere) countries as well.  I don&#x27;t have an explanation other than more people are doing startups.<p>&quot;Are international companies solving different problems?&quot;  Not really.  Most foreign firms are solving problems which US companies could equally address; global problems.<p>&quot;How do visas work?&quot;  It is a &#x27;bad situation.&#x27;  Unlike US founders they don&#x27;t have the option of remaining in SV after YC ends.  The visa application process is &#x27;broken and horrible.&#x27;  We as entrepreneurs/folks in the community should actively attempt to make this situation easier; in addition to it being the right thing to do, it makes it easier to recruit people from abroad.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re known for having a good people radar.  What are the red flags you see prior to a cofounder problem?&quot;  JL is not technical so she looks for other things in their 10 minute interview.  Do founders get along?  Don&#x27;t fight in front of us.  Do they have a good vibe between them?  Don&#x27;t interrupt your co-founder aggressively.  Do they understand their domain well?  If they&#x27;re a B2C company, I ask to see if they&#x27;ve thought deeply about consumer needs.  Defensiveness is not a good trait.  We want to work with people who will have enjoyable conversations with us, not people who get angry.<p>Trivia: YC decisions are made immediately after the 10 minute interview, in the room.  We do 20 interviews a day and would otherwise forget.<p>Red flag: 90/10 equity split between founders.  Even with 1+ years extra in the company, as time goes to infinity you will have equal mental investment, and 90/10 will cause terrible resentment.<p>JL: &quot;I am an expert in founder breakups.&quot;  Warning signs: joining as co-founder purely for the purpose of a YC application.  It has been known to work but that is often a bad sign.  You might not know each other or have good working relationship, and that will crack in the YC stress crucible.  I like seeing college roommates or 5-year coworkers apply.  They&#x27;re going to have better working relationship and ability to overcome issues.<p>Regarding the new policy about YC partners investing in startups: This is a pro-startup move.  In past Paul or Paul would invest in the occasional startup, which was OK for a few years, but these days Gary Tan et al have funds, and the pre-Demo Day investment from partners was causing signaling issues.  Companies w/o partner investment were being seen as losers.  We nixed this to protect interest of the startups.<p>YC applauds partners who have funds orthogonal to YC: more funding opportunities for startups, yay.<p>YC funding non-profits after success with the Watsi experiment.<p>Current YC batch is more diverse than typical.  56 year old founder (oldest ever), father-son team, more international founders, more female founders, etc.  (Moderator seems to think the 56 year old is quite the outlier.)<p>Q&A with the audience @ 32:00:<p>Q1: To JL/PG: How did you build the community of alumni even though some compete with their individual companies?<p>Fundamental to roots of YC and the community culture.  If you help someone, someone will help you.  People who do not behave within community norms are shunned very quickly.  Moderator adds that the community is tight-knit and doesn&#x27;t leak very often.  JL says they try to have batches intermingle.  Secrecy/etc is not an Applesque strategy -- the founders are probably just too busy running companies to run mouths.<p>Example of YC alumni network helping: Bump got substantial promotion from Apple.  Servers melted.  Founder of Cloudkick jumps in within 15 minutes, goes to house to fix servers.  &quot;That&#x27;s the power of the YC community. <i>sustained spontaneous applause</i>&quot;<p>Q2: How can red-blooded capitalists and non-profit companies learn from each other?<p>Non-profits can apply tactics like moving-fast-and-breaking things, launching early, and listening to users.  Historically nonprofits tend to be bureaucratic and antiquated.  We hope that if they become more startup-y they&#x27;ll be more successful at advancing missions to the benefit of the wider world.<p>For-profit companies support Watsi in many ways; very special.<p>Q3 (moderator): Founders at Work most impactful real book on what it is like to be an entrepreneur.  JL wants to write a sequel.  Founder of Mosy (sp?) recommended FaW when discouraging the moderator from pursuing his startup idea, which that founder described as doomed, in favor of founding a successful next company, which FaW would help with.",1392723071

Given the quadrupling of address sizes, wouldn&#x27;t that mean there&#x27;d need to be 1/4th the number of routes? And peering destroys the hierarchy, does it not?<p>No.. the point is that each ISP will get only one very large prefix (/32 or bigger) instead of many small ones, which can&#x27;t be aggregated like it is the case for IPv4.<p>Right now there are about 46k ASN&#x27;s in the legacy internet announcing about 490k IPv4 routes.

As you will still have to run CGN to get all your customers online. Unless of course you do want to change the network infrastructure. At which point your solution gets much worse than plain and simple IPv6.<p>> It keep being phrased as &quot;what is the source address of an IPv6 host on an IPv4 network&quot;. It seems to me the answer should simply be &quot;the first 32 bits of the IPv6 address&quot; - and it seems stupid it&#x27;s not structured like this.<p>Sure.. that solves the routing problem (except for IPv4 routing table explosion), but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that IPv4-only hosts still can&#x27;t talk to IPv5-hosts. You send [IPv4][IPv5] packet to IPv4 host. Huh? What&#x27;s that IPv5 thing? Or the other way around.. IPv4 host sees AAA record (with IPv5) in DNS..<p>Your proposal solves nothing that can&#x27;t also be done with IPv6 and tunnels if you are really keen on keeping your 5 old router running a few more months before throwing it away (which you can&#x27;t do anyway, as your limited FIB size will force you to buy new hardware anyway, due to IPv4 route table fragmentation).",1392721986

7257478,comment,7225739,7228651,1,0,dougabug,,,"If you test one person at random, the odds of that person being the President equals the probability of a true positive divided by the probability that the test provides a Positive result (i.e. the sum of the probabilities for True and False Positives). The probability of a true positive is the probability that test subject is the President times the conditional probability that the subject tests positive given that they are the President. If the subject is chosen at random from the population of the US, then the a priori odds of this person being the President is about 1/314M times a conditional probability of testing positive of 1. The probability of a false negative is the a priori odds of a random person being the President, times the conditional probability of a non-President testing positive. By hypothesis, this is (1-1/314M)<i>0.00001. So the odds of a subject chosen at random from the overall US population must be approximately (1/314M)/((1/314M)+(1-1/314M)</i>0.00001), which simplifies to 1/(1+(314M-1)*0.00001, or about 1/3141.<p>The ~99.97% chance that the test result is a false positive for a subject chosen at random is a consequence of the prior probability of that subject being the President in the first place being over 3000 times lower than the probability of a positive test result. In other words, though the sensitivity of the test is perfect, the specificity of the test is insufficient to isolate a condition as rare as the Presidency. It has nothing to do with testing one person being inherently more decisive than testing more than one.<p>Only narrowing the pool of candidates in a way which will increase the prior probability that the subject is the President will improve the situation, not random decimation to a single test subject. The GP gave several correct examples such as limiting the test to those who were much more likely to be the President in the first place (eg. a person randomly found sitting in the President&#x27;s chair at the Oval Office might have a prior probability of being the President of greater than 0.01, millions of times greater than that of a randomly selected person in the US).",1392721492

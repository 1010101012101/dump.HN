One area where brain research still struggles to model the basics is how the brain actually integrates information over time, and how internal models and representations are formed.<p>The ""classical"" synaptic response model was always good at explaining basic signal transmission, but it was essentially stateless. Now we know that neurons are far from stateless, there is extensive chemical modification going on working at different timescales and I guess this ""new"" discovery is also an important piece that was missing from the standard model. It may explain advanced neuronal states that surpasses simple chemical sensitization and suppression - and it may also provide hints about how feedback works in learning and building internal representations.<p>ANNs and other AI techniques are getting very good and efficient, but one reason why general artificial intelligence (as in artificial persons) continues to escape us is that we still don't have a good model how the brain organizes and improves itself to form a consistent but autonomously adapting unit which can rightfully be called a mind. I hope that AI people can use these pointers provided by bio research and advance toward this goal.",1298080484

Two big things that I think help it:<p>* It's built into all modern browsers, either in production (Chrome) or early-access/beta (Firefox, Safari) with the exception of IE9.  And with Chrome Frame, the lack in IE might not be a huge deal.<p>* It's as low-level as successful APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D (obviously being based on OpenGL).  This means that it gives a stable basic API that people can code to that will work across browsers, across platforms.  They picked OpenGL ES 2.0 as the baseline because it's the 3D API used on mobile devices, iPhones/iPads and Android devices being the most important.  While this low-level nature can make it a bit of a pain to program if you want a higher-level API (like, say, VRML's or X3D's) it also means that people have a solid baseline on which to build higher-level APIs.

I'm not a chip designer, and I'm reporting what he told me from memory, so I may be slightly off, but here goes:<p>Sometimes it <i></i>is<i></i> completely safe. For instance, suppose a chip maker sells a chip in three speeds: 500 mhz, 750 mhz, and 1000 mhz. You have a 500 mhz chip. It might actually have been manufactured to be a 750 mhz, and passed all the tests at 750 mhz, but the manufacturer had a shortage of 500 mhz chips and an excess of 750 mhz chips, and so marked yours as 500 mhz and sold it as such. Congratulations! This is a chip that is safe to at least 750 mhz.<p>Sometimes, however, your 500 mhz chip may be one that was meant to be 750 or 1000 mhz, but failed their tests at those speed. It was fine at 500 mhz, so they sold it as such. This is a chip that is risky to run at 750.<p>How can you tell whether you have one of the safe chips or one of the unsafe chips? You might think you can simply try it. Over clock it, put it under the heaviest load you've got, and see if it appears fine. If it seems to work, you might assume it is one of the safe ones.<p>The problem with this is that failure can be too subtle to notice. It might be that at 750, your chip loses the lower bit of integer multiply if one of the operands has a run of alternating bits longer than 18 bits, or something really obscure like that, something that your testing is not likely to hit. (Look how long it took the Pentium FDIV bug to be discovered).<p>When the chip manufacturer is doing their test to see if the chip should be a 500, 750, or 1000, they know where the weak points are and how to stress them. They are also testing before the chip is put in its case, and so can access test points on the chip and see electrically that the signals are fine at the danger points.",1298078088

It makes Scala seem like the biggest gorram language on the planet. The worst part is that things get harder to understand because one part of a chapter hinges on understanding of something from 300 pages ago.<p>I'll take time to highlight what I find to be one of the most important sections of the book: Type Parameterization<p>It starts by explaining the concept of a functional queue. This has nothing to do with type parametrization except that it will later be an example of how to use type parameterization and it is a type that can be parameterized. It then goes on to explain make constructors private and private classes.<p>Finally, it introduces variance annotations. Ah hah, the first part of the chapter pertinent to its heading and we're only 7 pages in! Herein, the concepts of covariance and contravariance are briefly explained, though, for me, not with enough detail to actually understand them. We then compare how Scala handles variance next to Java, a language that I am not learning, though it is somewhat pertinent in that in order to maintain binary compatibility with Java some stupid crap you should't do except if you're using a Java library is possible. Next there is an explanation of how the compiler checks variance annotations which is useful, but something much better left to an appendix given that it will only be needed to understood if you get compiler errors.<p>We get to the next actually useful part of the chapter in learning about lower bounds on type parameters. Now we go back to contravariance. And then upper bounds on type parameters, though not before detouring into privacy scoping rules for objects, another rather irrelevant subject.<p>Now at this point, I have gotten it set in my head that covariance, contravariance, and upper type boundaries and lower type boundaries are all very closely related. And it takes me about 4 hours to figure out that they're not except in the sense that you can use said annotations in a parameterized type.<p>In total, the chapter is nearly 30 pages long and relates about 5 useful pages of information about type parameterization in Scala, the high level concepts of which could have been explained far more clearly in half a page each and by explaining how they are not strictly related. It's also really great that pertinent information about private classes and private constructors is in an unrelated chapter.<p>What is unfortunate is that this is the bible for this language. New programmers are recommended it. Personally, I'd be swearing Scala off if it wasn't so clear to me that it was a really powerful language worth knowing. But the arrangement of this book is like a utensil drawer crammed full of forks and knives in a completely haphazard fashion.",1298078074

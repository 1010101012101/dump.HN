For those that do wear out, keep in mind that adults do not respond the same way to as children to all diseases. For example, Tetanus is bad in an adult, so we routinely take boosters for Tetanus. Adults are pretty resistant to Pertussis and don&#x27;t get as bad a disease when they do get it, so it&#x27;s not critical that adults get boosters for that.<p>You comment about hygiene is entirely misinformed. Hygiene is important for Ebola and Herpes, but not for any of the diseases we get immunizations for.<p>You write &quot;People who choose not to use them are not a problem because if they were then every adult who hasn&#x27;t had a vaccine in seven years is also a problem so the blame should be pretty thin.&quot; Again, that&#x27;s entirely wrong. Adults, as I mentioned above, are not the carriers. Secondly, please go to Wikipedia and understand &quot;herd immunity&quot;.

It&#x27;s probably &quot;possible&quot; if you put about half the invariant in the type and half the invariant in documentation, of course, but that&#x27;s a much weaker claim!<p>Java is in an interesting place in that its type system is rudimentary but not unpowerful. C is a more useful didactic target---there really do exist invariants which can be encoded in Haskell types but could never be encoded in C types!<p>Another huge target is parametricity. You can write Java code which is &quot;maybe sort of parametric&quot; but it really isn&#x27;t and subsequently you can never trust it because of the existence of things like global reference equality and hash codes (in the least).<p>Finally, there are expressivity concerns. Java cannot encode as many things in its type language as something like Agda (to make a clear comparison). You can simply note that Java&#x27;s type equality is nowhere nearly as developed as Agda&#x27;s!<p>As an example of using Java to indicate a fairly non-trivial invariant and comparing that implementation to Scala, Haskell, and C# consider Tony Morris&#x27; challenge<p><a href=""http://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/understanding-practical-api-design-static-typing-and-functional-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tonymorris.github.io/blog/posts/understanding-practic...</a>",1422547005

8966800,comment,8966185,8966574,0,0,drzaiusapelord,,,"I don&#x27;t think top-down decrees like this works. Look at say CSICOP, Carl Sagan, etc who built out a fairly strong skeptic movement in the 80s and 90s. It didn&#x27;t affect religiosity or cut down on beliefs in the paranormal. Frankly, it just comes off as a lot of paternal academics calling everyone ignorant cavemen compared to their materialistic views. It didn&#x27;t come off as a labor of love for one&#x27;s fellow man and as you can tell from modern skeptics and atheists, it just quickly devolves into namecalling, general rudeness, and dismissive strawmen. Neckbeards aren&#x27;t exactly known for their social or persuasion skills.<p>So we tried that approach. What now? Maybe address this on a deeper level like better grade school and high school education.  For example, we can see a lot of our public schools are unionized, which often means bad teachers and poor performers are impossible to fire.  Outcomes get worse and big city high schools like in Chicago and NYC float around a 60% graduation rate. Would the left who is championing the vaccine cause be willing to go against its own unions to make schools better? I doubt it.<p>I really don&#x27;t believe the TV tells people what to do. It often reflects whats already out there.  Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey and others didn&#x27;t start the anti-vax movement - it was in full swing by the time they latched onto it. Unless you&#x27;re willing to do proper grassroots work, its just not going to happen.  That means solutions that upset the status quo like attacking teacher unions. Or discriminating against un-vaxxed kids and not letting them go to school. I can&#x27;t see the activist left doing that either. Would you be able to accept a better vaccination rate if you worked hard at it every single day, but only are planning on seeing results in 10 or 15 years? How motivated would activists, especially internet slactivists, be with a long range plan like this?<p>Personally, I see this as largely unstoppable. Social fads and mores follow a pendulum shift. Right now we&#x27;re deep into homeopathic, anti-vaxx, etc territory. People are starting to feel the burn of it (dying kids, chronic illness, etc) and will naturally swing the pendulum back the other way once they&#x27;re properly disincentized by their medical issues.  Documentaries, celebrity endorsements, etc won&#x27;t change a thing. This is largely a chaotic process that needs to play itself out. Its a conversation happening in every office, every daycare, every mothers group, etc and we really can&#x27;t penetrate it, the same way the skeptic movement never penetrated religion or those who believe in the paranormal. If anything, belief in the paranormal has skyrocketed since Sagan&#x27;s and CSICOP&#x27;s loudmouth skeptic movement. Laying down the facts is only one part of trying to implement social change. I wish more people understood that.",1422546900

8966798,comment,8963658,8964824,0,0,geofft,,,"Yes, but (to stretch this analogy quite thin) the goal here isn&#x27;t shortness or tallness. The goal is being able to watch the baseball game. It just so happens that there&#x27;s a big wooden fence there, which may or may not have some reason to exist, but its <i>purpose</i> is definitely not to block short people from watching the game. If it has a purpose, it&#x27;s something else. Blocking short people is a side effect.<p>So, if shortness is distributed unequally, and there&#x27;s a big wooden fence in front of the game, you <i>could</i> respond by saying that tall people are naturally more suited for game-watching, and argue based on tall people having historically been more successful at it. But that claim isn&#x27;t likely to stand up to a deep examination of causality and reality.<p>There are two significantly more defensible responses: give short people enough crates to see over the fence, or tear down the fence (preferably by figuring out what purpose it serves, and building something else to serve its purpose without the side effects, like a Plexiglas fence).<p>Then your ability to watch the game will be determined only by your natural talent at game-watching, not by your natural talent at being tall.",1422546882

Got too big, too fast and didn&#x27;t preserve the culture.<p>The biggest an organization can get and hope to have a reasonable chance of not going evil is probably some multiple of Dunbar&#x27;s number.  I think realistically the uppermost limit on it is going to be Dunbar&#x27;s squared and assuming everyone has really high social skills and no life outside work then it&#x27;s 250*250 = 62k people.  But that only counts if everyone&#x27;s job is doing nothing more than keeping up with the company&#x27;s culture; no actual work gets done.<p>If you assume that you want your people to work while they&#x27;re at the office then Dunbar&#x27;s probably goes down quite a bit.  Let&#x27;s use the more reasonable 150 number that&#x27;s closer to average and let&#x27;s assume that you only want people to spend about 20% of their time on keeping in tune with everyone around them.  That puts your group size at 30 instead of 150 or 250.<p>Now let&#x27;s suppose that we organize hierarchically and that the senior execs really do live/eat/sleep/breathe the company.  They&#x27;re professional, high functioning managers, so let&#x27;s give them the full 250.  And then let&#x27;s suppose that there are group managers who split their time between talking with their group and with senior management.<p>That gives you 250 groups of 30 people each or 7500 total employees.  And in order to keep up with all these groups you&#x27;ve got to have 3-15 execs who are all on the same page and running themselves ragged trying to keep up.  If you start adding more levels of management hierarchy you run the risk that as information gets passed down the chain it gets modified slightly or tremendously to serve the interests of any one individual in said chain.  And there are too many bosses you have to &quot;go over&quot; to get a reasonable chance of talking to a real decision maker if you think something isn&#x27;t right, but your direct boss is telling you to do anyhow.<p>This chart shows that Google cracked 7500 employees before 2007.  <a href=""http://www.statista.com/statistics/273744/number-of-full-time-google-employees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statista.com/statistics/273744/number-of-full-tim...</a><p>I&#x27;d guess that they did between 2002 and 2004.

That&#x27;s pretty impressive (or my theory is totally wrong).<p>Either way, past a certain point more employees are more of a liability than a badge of honor.  It just increases the risk you do something stupid because everyone believes they&#x27;re doing the right thing and there are no lines of communication to correct the misunderstanding, intentional or not.",1422546846

And yes, there should be a pattern to force their use, for exactly the reasons you specified.<p>The claim that&#x27;s being lobbied against Angular, however, is that they were schizophrenic in their choice of implementations for all of their patterns, or to state it another way, that the same advantages could have been gained with much, much simpler patterns.  Instead of building a nice clean framework, they built an auto-magical framework, and declared you must learn every workaround in the &quot;Angular Way&quot; to use it.<p>There are plenty of js frameworks now, many of which have analogous components to directives and controllers and views, etc.  But while most, if not all of them, allow for the same advantages you&#x27;ve mentioned, few of them do so in such a complicated, boilerplate, and arbitrary manner.<p>And this is scary, because it looks like they&#x27;re continuing this trend with a completely new &quot;Angular 2.0 Way&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m going to go off the deep end here for a moment, but, back when I was in college, I took some marketing class where they discussed in depth the idea of user interface as a method of product lockin.  The idea was if you built a product simple enough, but then obfuscated the correct method of usage correctly, you could make a product that was simple enough that new comers would be drawn to your product, but complicated enough that it would take so much time to master, that most who did so would actively desire never to leave as they were now the local experts.  SharePoint really is a poster-child for this sort of dark design.

So, streams are almost always more valuable than strict lists.<p>In my mind, I tend to think of this as being true up to the point where the size of the structure is statically known. Thus for fixed-sized vectors (or arrays), spine strictness is very important—it gives you better control over memory usage in the <i>very</i> least.<p>Unfortunately, no language I know of has a good concept of &quot;strictness polymorphism&quot; so in Haskell you end up with duplicate implementations of Strict and Lazy data structures. This ends up being not so much duplicated code, but a whole hell of a lot of duplicated API.<p>And I think the stream-cons/cons distinction is trivial. It&#x27;s a lack of proper polymorphism that you&#x27;re dealing with there and that can be easily implemented in any language with good polymorphism.

I would have hoped HN would be more informed.<p>Its well established that no vaccine has an effect that lasts longer than seven years. This is the reason for booster shots. Every vaccine researcher and pharma company will tell you this.<p>The reason we immunize children is because their hygiene practices are poorer than most adults and they are a marginalized class. They get more diseases due to poor hygiene which encourages adults to look for easy solutions. And adults are in a position to force those solutions on the powerless.<p>Adults do not immunize themselves every seven years because the risk/reward profile simply isn&#x27;t worth it. Every shot, vaccine or not, is a risk. On the other hand, adult-quality hygiene and typical first world nutrition cause people to avoid dying from diseases already. For a recent example look at Ebola. Many people simply can&#x27;t get it because they are too healthy. This is why ebola never went anywhere in the USA and many other countries.<p>Adults with poor hygiene that get more diseases are ignored because they are a smaller group and in a position to resist so they are not worth targeting.<p>Most people aren&#x27;t aware that the USA stayed polio-free for many years while a live attenuated virus was given to children. It was known by pharma companies that the live attenuated virus would become a full strength virus in the child&#x27;s stool. Look it up, I remember at least one American woman catching it from changing a diaper and it was in the news. Now we use dead virus because of people like her. But the larger point is that for many many hundreds of thousands of diaper changes, there just wasn&#x27;t a problem. Other countries with the live vaccine had lots of problems. What was the difference? Hygiene and nutrition.<p>Vaccines are a great tool. Like any tool they should be voluntary. People who choose not to use them are not a problem because if they were then every adult who hasn&#x27;t had a vaccine in seven years is also a problem so the blame should be pretty thin.<p>And finally, please note that no one died and many were hospitalized for precaution, not an actual need. Healthy, first world people die from measles at an extremely small rate. I know it doesn&#x27;t sell newspapers or get people to read your blog but this was not a deadly epidemic. All of the angry rhetoric around this event could have been avoided if people were informed ahead of time that there would be no deaths in otherwise health people.

So much that the only answer is &quot;it depends.&quot;<p>The first thing it depends on is where one is wandering on a spectrum from Coca-Cola brown beverage trade secrets to full on Stallmanism. People can and will disagree about &quot;the right thing&quot; using plausible arguments based on reasonable assumptions [this doesn&#x27;t preclude implausible arguments based on unreasonable assumptions or the other corners of the 2x2 grid]. We all decide what sort of person to be.<p>Since this is a common conundrum, Spolsky has encountered it and being Spolsky has clearly thought about the issue. My understanding, and he can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong is:<p><pre><code>   1] open-sourcing should be done because it benefits users.\n   2] open-sourcing doesn&#x27;t always benefit users.\n</code></pre>\nMy gut says that Spolsky and Stallman more or less would agree on something like the language of 1]. They don&#x27;t on 2]. Spolsky takes the philosophically utilitarian approach to &quot;because&quot;: if it benefits users, then open source. Stallman takes a philosophically deontological view of &quot;because&quot;: Open source always benefits users. There is no 2] for Stallman. For what it&#x27;s worth, I admire him greatly for that.<p>Wasabi is FogCreek&#x27;s VBscript compiler. It performs a specific task. That task doesn&#x27;t require a math library so Wasabi doesn&#x27;t have one. The only people who need it are Fogbugz customers for the purpose of using Fogbugz. They don&#x27;t need Wasabi to have a math library. [wasabi]<p>The compelling rationale for not open-sourcing it is that it basically sucks as a compiler for the way people usually use compilers. In the very limited use case of Fogbugz, it doesn&#x27;t suck. It&#x27;s even good enough for Spolsky. If someone wants to learn about compilers <i>The Dragon Book</i> is better. If they want to learn from example code, there are much better compilers in open source. Is the world better if using Wasabi in the wild just plain sucks and studying the source code leads to poor conclusions about writing compilers? Probably not.<p>Why not just open source all of Fogbugz? It uses  technologies which are licensed under terms incompatible with various open source licenses. The same is true of StackOverflow. They both have free as in beer options. It&#x27;s a more generous business model than used car lots operate under.<p>Since you are asking the question, you&#x27;re in the land of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is hard because it requires weighing potential harms against potential benefits. That&#x27;s engineering for you.<p>I think the world is better for what StackOverflow provides right now than it would be if it provided less but was entirely open source. The pace of improvements that not having to patch bugs on other people&#x27;s systems allows outweighs the benefits of it going the route of PHPbb.<p>Good luck.<p>[wasabi]: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html</a>",1422545898

HoloLens isn&#x27;t in any sense holography -- it&#x27;s an augmented reality device that integrates light-angle depth cues.<p>Augmented reality is important. Glass failed miserably at it, because despite all the sensors, Glass locked down the ability to use them -- and on top of that, Glass locked down most of the FOV, preventing meaningful spacial integration between real and virtual objects. The Oculus Rift will, largely, not be used for augmented reality -- you&#x27;d need to add a camera, and there are definite safety concerns if the camera is damaged or disconnected.<p>Depth cues are also important. VR sickness is not merely related to lag, but also to lack of coordination between depth cues -- something that is hormone-bound (which is why women have a comparatively harder time with head mounted displays -- estrogen levels are linked with the degree to which stereoscopy dominates over color and light angle depth cues). What microsoft has introduced is the first head mounted display that won&#x27;t make women puke -- which could conceivably double its market over the Rift (since a little over half of all serious video game players are female).<p>However, when you introduce an exciting piece of consumer electronics -- especially something so novel that a brand new API has to be made for it -- you need to be targeting the technical people who will be using the development kits. Those people are exactly the same people who are likely to refuse to develop on HoloLens because some marketroid who didn&#x27;t know what a hologram was decided it sounded cool.<p>Glass also alienated developers, but arguably in a more extreme way -- by limiting them to static web pages, basically. But, Google has good mindshare among techies compared to Microsoft. It may end up being a wash. After all, Glass essentially failed because it was borderline-useless, and it was borderline-useless because the designers pulled a Steve Jobs and heavily handicapped third party developers; Microsoft, on the other hand, may end up pulling an Atari Jaguar on itself -- having too few developers and too few properties because nobody ended up putting down the effort to learn how to integrate with the thing.<p>The most likely result, however, will be that Microsoft will do what it did with the Surface -- before HoloLens comes to market it will have transformed from a proper AR device to something more like Glass, the same way Surface started out as a computing coffee table with all sorts of interesting features and ended up becoming an uninteresting tablet by the time it was released. Then, some other company will take their idea of using micro-mirror arrays to handle angular depth cues in an AR display, and produce something indistinguishable from the original demo much cheaper.",1422545706

Discussions of or relating to X and Y are squelched sans privacy for fear of backlash; Z is next on the chopping block because it is adjacent to Y.

It creates the difference between the hot cheerleaders and the normal girls.<p>What does this is gender roles and their consequent beauty norms. People decide that women are best off looking fit and have big boobs and are outgoing and have a certain personality. These norms are communicated to them all throughout their childhood through media and peer pressure. In exactly the same way, ideals create the jock as well.<p>When you actually look at the people embodying these stereotypes, there&#x27;s nothing all that much different about them, they&#x27;re just people who&#x27;ve managed to adopt these norms. They might even be meaner than normal, enforcing these roles themselves.<p>Gender roles, beauty norms are part of the culture that feminists call patriarchy. Patriarchy is just sexism at the social / cultural scale. They wouldn&#x27;t exist without these broader cultural dynamics, people would just be people and you could ask out whoever you want and she wouldn&#x27;t shut you down because she has a place to maintain in the hierarchy, a hierarchy created and maintained by sexism.<p>Once you realize that women perpetuate patriarchy too and how, that&#x27;s when you start to really understand just what it is.<p>If you need an analogy, think about how the general lack of respect for privacy at both the individual and the legislative levels negatively affects all of us, even those who &#x27;have nothing to hide&#x27;.",1422545102

If half of them buy it...&quot; Even after they explain these attributes that is still a silly stat that means nothing. There&#x27;s also no reason to believe that 50% of the potential market will buy the product (and they claim Kindle had twice as large of a market, sold twice as many as they&#x27;re projecting for the Hololens but was still a huge failure).<p>> The endgame for enhancing our lives with digital visual tools is not virtual reality, it’s this mixed reality. If the glasses can help you accomplish tasks that matter to you, ones you already do, then it’s not just fun, it’s useful.<p>Microsoft hasn&#x27;t, even ballpark, shown that Hololens can be productive. I watched their entire three hour press event, the demos they showed were very unpolished and didn&#x27;t show anything more productive than can be accomplished on a PC.<p>It just looks districting. Google Glass&#x27;s biggest issue was its price, but at least it seemed to be useful for niche things (e.g. turn by turn walking navigation). It is unclear what Hololens&#x27; use cases are, gaming maybe comes to mind, but this article is trying to sell it to business people/executives (where the case doesn&#x27;t exist).<p>> Because Glass couldn’t actually “see” what you are doing, it can’t really be helpful except as a tool for grabbing information when you’re out and about.<p>That sentence contradicts itself. Google Glass contained AR functionality and could overlay information on what was in front of you (producing a very &quot;holo&quot;-like experience).

Nowhere do they explain how they know &quot;consumers are ready for new technology&quot; and the iPad example is bad since the iPad didn&#x27;t compete with the iPod and the iPad had more mass market appeal than the HoloLens.<p>Honestly this entire article reads like a paid PR piece for HoloLens. I&#x27;d be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t. Most of the stuff said in it is baseless, contradictory, or non-sensicle.<p>I have nothing against HoloLens in particular (although I do have some concerns about its software catalogue, or lack of, and we still don&#x27;t know the retail price).

If it was really banning people who bring in outside food, they wouldn&#x27;t sell you a ticket in the first place.  But they do sell you a ticket, and then prevent you from using the ticket if you enter with food/drink.<p>Put another way, if a person tries to enter with food, they don&#x27;t ban that person forever.  Rather, as soon as the person as thrown away the food, they are allowed to enter.  So clearly the ban is on the food, and not the person.  To ban a specific person would require banning an attribute of the person.  Carrying food is not an attribute.  The argument is quite nonsensical, to be honest.  It&#x27;s like saying a rule against knives is really about banning people who carry knives.  That&#x27;s of course not the case, and the rule really is specifically about knives and not about people.",1422543648

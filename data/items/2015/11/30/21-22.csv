Then I repackaged it and renamed it and it got some traction. The community only started up one year ago. Before that, it was just me.<p>I was always very greatful for any comment my project received - Especially negative/constructive ones.<p>I didn&#x27;t get much feedback early on so there weren&#x27;t many opportunities to improve.<p>SocketCluster was never about the code. It was always about creating a useful tool. It has gone through many refactorings and changes in technical philosophy. Seeing steady improvement in the product and the dedication of the community is what keeps me happy.<p>I was very fortunate that the project got so much traction. It did help me with my career.

No excellence of academia redeems a statement like &quot;The Paris attacks did not take place.&quot; I&#x27;d argue that any kind of academic appreciation of these false statements, in postmodern reflections on hyper-reality, say more about the hyper-reality that academia seems to dwell in, particularly in the non-technical sciences like sociology and philosophy. For reasons of lack of rigor, it&#x27;s easier for these specious &quot;worldly&quot; reflections to dwell in the non-technical sciences, than lets say Chemistry, Biology, Math or Physics.

Lots of groups fought the US of course, a number were wiped out to varying degrees.  Because the US held an overwhelming advantage in conventional firepower, the only groups with any lasting &quot;success&quot; were the ones that embraced terrorism as their core of their operations. When the Americans left the strongest of these groups -- ISI -- consolidated power and the destabilization in Syria created another power vacuum which ISIS flowed into.",1448920731

The most important thing about this list is that it is a checklist where the aim is to develop ideas that tick as many as possible off the list, not every one. It is impossible (well near impossible) to have an idea that ticks every one of them - just getting 7 or 8 makes the idea a fantastically good idea.<p>Ideas that can be bootstrapped can affect the world. They might take a little more time, or be a little more limited in scope, but having external funding is not a prerequisite for changing the world.<p>Of course you can exploit first mover advantage and natural monopolies without external funding. You just need an idea that is cheap enough and profitable enough that it can be bootstrapped. Of course finding such ideas is really, really hard, but if you do find one it is very valuable.",1448920713

I&#x27;m still rent-controlled at that place but market rate on that same apartment is roughly double now, and that&#x27;s far far more than any of my friends are paying (my location is pretty great).  So even worst-case (i.e. if I was paying market and chose not to move into a cheaper place), I would be paying maybe $40k?<p>So the long and short of it is, $125k, even before tax, is far more than you need to live in SF for a single person.

In the context of giving critical feedback, it&#x27;s easy to focus on the problem, the specific area you want to correct, and reduce the person on the other side to just being the cause of the problem.<p>For example, you&#x27;re a team lead and have a developer on your team who routinely writes buggy code and shipped a broken feature last release, which caused a kerfuffle with a major client.<p>When you meet with them to discuss what happened, in your mind, you&#x27;re not talking to &quot;a person&quot;. You&#x27;re talking to the developer who caused this big problem you have to deal with. In your mind, you are handling a problem, not talking to a person.<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget that the developer is a person with a lifetime of experiences different from yours, a different perspective, different strengths and weaknesses, different insecurities, different stuff going on in their personal life. You need to remember they are &quot;a person&quot; and as such, entitled to a modicum of dignity and respect.<p>So, sure, address the problem with radical candor, but remember this problem does not define the entirety of the person. In other words, treat them how you would want to be treated, because I assure you, their life is just as important to them as yours is to you.<p>At least, that&#x27;s my interpretation.<p>And if your response is still, &quot;Duh, that&#x27;s obvious,&quot; then maybe you&#x27;re just better at giving critical feedback than most people. I haven&#x27;t been on the receiving end myself, but I have often seen managers give feedback that is belittling and reduces the entire worth of a person to a single mistake.",1448920395

Insert some other service if you&#x27;ve never had or wanted cable TV.  Right now I pay something like $40/mo for cable TV and still have to watch something like 15-18 minutes of advertising per hour of programming.<p>The &quot;Google version&quot; of cable TV would either be free or cost a nominal $5/mo subscription and their algorithm would automatically use my viewing history to determine which ads might be applicable to me.  As a result, I&#x27;d only have to watch a single 5 minute ad segment in the middle of every hour-long program.  The better odds of a given ad being applicable would make the ad time more valuable so they wouldn&#x27;t need to run as many to make the same amount of profit.  Likewise, people and companies that want to reach potential customers waste less of their advertising and publicity budget on viewers that would never buy their products.<p>So, gross oversimplification aside, there&#x27;s &quot;making money from personal info&quot; and there&#x27;s &quot;using data to make the same money from less advertising than traditional methods&quot;.  I&#x27;m sort of on the fence myself and somewhat playing devil&#x27;s advocate here but it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s often lost in discussions.<p>My main concerns are that government, law enforcement, or criminals would gain access to data that I only agreed to share with one company&#x27;s algorithms.  My main point is that &quot;making money from personal data&quot; can sound a lot like &quot;selling my personal info to god knows who&quot; which I&#x27;ve never known to be the case regarding Google or any of the info that&#x27;s collected by Microsoft in newer versions of Windows.<p>My main conflict is between two things:  a reflexive distrust of the motives of business and an acknowledgement that some really cool things (and plenty of mundane but still good things) only work when you have the data to power them.

By definition there&#x27;s a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to the best arrangement for the end users or the industry as a whole. It would however be possible to at least move the code development of UVM to something like Github and accept patches - this would be a very welcome change.<p>Another problem that faces our industry is the market size - there aren&#x27;t enough users to commercially justify certain development efforts. Only the subset of the language features that are commonly used are implemented straight away, the remainder follows at leisure / never. This means you very quickly find bugs if you stray off the beaten track and any &quot;exotic&quot; features are never implemented because there isn&#x27;t sufficient demand. Of course there will never be demand because everything breaks if you use a new feature - we have to develop to the lowest common denominator of our multi-vendor toolchain, which basically means nothing above some syntactic sugar on top of Verilog. So in effect, for synthesis, there hasn&#x27;t really been much in the way of advancement for decades; interfaces are about as good as it gets.<p>Compare this pace with the software world, where there were multiple complete implementations of C++11 available well before the standard was even ratified!<p>Unfortunately the high barriers to entry and the low number of users, coupled with the enforced conservatism of not being able to use any new features and the mindset that breeds, makes it very difficult for innovative companies to enter and gain traction. We therefore don&#x27;t have the natural selection that occurs in software, where new ideas gather momentum and stick around, while the older less efficient languages and processes gradually fade into obscurity.<p>The current mindset seems to be to try and design everything into the language up-front, which results in a very bloated feature-set which also falls over as soon you try to do something in a way not envisaged by the committee. Designing a language should be a case of trying to provide the minimum feature set possible that enables any capability - with SystemVerilog we&#x27;ve got it backwards where we&#x27;ve tried to think of every possibly capability and add a feature for it.<p>Obviously we can&#x27;t miraculously increase the EDA market size (although I&#x27;m still optimistic that FPGAs will gradually gather more software engineers into the fold), but we can make decisions based on this reality. In practice I would suggest this means that any new feature or new keyword would require very good justification for inclusion. We really need to be stripping parts of the language out, however unfortunately that can probably never happen now.<p>For example, interfaces are a good idea, but rather than introduce a completely new feature it would have been possible to facilitate the same functionality that interfaces provide by allowing module or package instances to be passed around as first class objects. This would have enabled other use cases without the committee having to think of them all up-front.<p>TL;DR: SystemVerilog is terrible for the industry - doesn&#x27;t solve the right problems for synthesis and doesn&#x27;t compete as as a good &quot;software&quot; language for verification.  It&#x27;s the worst of both worlds, and now EDA vendors need to spend a decade trying to re-coup their investment.",1448920184

It is spreading within the youth. How ? Well :<p>1) schools, bankrolled from Saudi Arabia and Turkey teach islamic supremacism to the kids of immigrant muslims.<p>2) western european states do token cleanups of these schools every 10 years or so, but not fast enough to make them stop.<p>3) these kids are not educated to the level even bad local schools educate local youngsters. At 18, they are suddenly abandoned, and quickly find out that no job, no family (not possible without job), no car, no status symbols, ... sucks<p>4) furthermore. Suddenly islamic supremacism educated kids finds society (including muslims) shun them, or worse. Why ? They have no decent skills, and because of the supremacism thing they are prone to violence.<p>5) they subsist on welfare for a while, generally causing trouble around them and little else.<p>6) someone offers them a purpose. &quot;Free&quot; brides (ie. kidnapped women and children. Like most muslim scholars, daesh sees nothing wrong with forced marriage at 6, after all the prophet did it. Makes you wonder how &quot;normal&quot; muslims morally deal with that).

ISIS isn&#x27;t suddenly &quot;better&quot; because they are killing in the name of something other than &quot;Islamic extremism.&quot; There are also plenty of extreme right-wing muslims who don&#x27;t kill people, which also suggests that a generic diagnosis of &quot;islamic extremism&quot; is not enough to explain ISIS.<p>If you /really/ believe ISIS is powered by a fervent belief in fundamentalist Islam and nothing else, then there are no remedies other than killing every member of the group as their rhetoric inescapably leads to the conclusion they should kill everyone who disagrees with them. Of course, to believe that, you also have to believe previous groups that espoused philosophies with similar conclusions (Al&#x27; Qaeda, etc) were lying - as we haven&#x27;t kill all of their members and their terrorist & militant activities have fallen off. If all muslim extremists are driven solely by personal belief in islamic extremism, we would never expect them to change their behavior.<p>But people do change! All the time. So, even if you believe that all extremely right-wing muslims want to kill everyone all the time (a preposition I find hard to believe myself), you should also see that some (most I would say) muslim extremists choose not to kill most of the people most of the time.

This is why they&#x27;ve attacked <i>everyone</i> - the US, France, Russia, and all the major Arab nations. Everyone is off fighting in Syria, and not as a unified front, but a bunch of independent powers making independent alliances and jockeying for position.<p>During a recent presidential debate, Rand Paul wisely asked the question, &quot;Are you ready to shoot down Russian planes?&quot; (note: I&#x27;m not a Rand Paul supporter.

If the US creates a no-fly zone while Russia wants to do bombing runs in it, we could have a situation where American and Russian planes are in direct combat.

When men have a chance for a family, they&#x27;ll do what is needed to make the attempt for a family (normally being productive members of society), after which they get far more needs met than when alone (consider that loneliness is quite dangerous for a person) and they likely have more to lose (especially if they have children).  Thus they are more behaved.<p>But in a polygamous society, there is far less of a chance.  So more men decide to not play by the rules.  They will seek out more dangerous means to meet their immediate needs.<p>All this being said, it isn&#x27;t the marriage that matters.  It is the family that does.  A society that only allows monogamy on paper, but which allows a polygamous marriages, and where a divide begins to exist meaning that you have many men without a chance of having a family will have the same issues.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not to sure what happens when many women don&#x27;t have a chance for a family.  While one might think it would work the same, there are a few key differences.  A man can be responsible for multiple simultaneous pregnancies, but a woman cannot.  A woman has, historically, had a level of assurance of the legitimacy of their children that a man does not, and on average men tend to be more physically powerful than women.  Also of note is that those last two factors stop being a significant difference with technology (paternity tests and guns being respective examples), so historic data may not fit what trends we will see in a technologically advanced society.

In any case, the ideology behind the attack and the conditions which made the attacker susceptible to adopting that ideology are distinct issues.<p>> Why don&#x27;t we say that gunmen attack Planned Parenthoods because of income inequality in the United States?<p>Actually, lots of people on the left -- the only people who generally acknowledge the overt ideological motivation of violence of Christian religious extremists -- point to social factors like income inequality and persistent poverty as among the factors that make people susceptible to that extremism (as well as pointing to deliberate acts by certain political elites to fan that extremism and channel it for political ends as contributing to the uptake of the extremism.)

He ignored his department chief and persuaded the operating-room nurse in charge of the sterile supplies, Gerda Ditzen, to assist him. She agreed, but only on the promise that he would do it on her rather than on himself. However, Forssmann tricked her by restraining her to the operating table and pretending to locally anaesthetise and cut her arm whilst actually doing it on himself.[3] He anesthetized his own lower arm in the cubital region and inserted a uretic catheter into his antecubital vein, threading it partly along before releasing Ditzen (who at this point realised the catheter was not in her arm) and telling her to call the X-ray department. They walked some distance to the X-ray department on the floor below where under the guidance of a fluoroscope he advanced the catheter the full 60 cm into his right ventricular cavity. This was then recorded on X-Ray film showing the catheter lying in his right atrium.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Forssmann#Life"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Forssmann#Life</a>",1448918693

Don&#x27;t tell me these people (who work for Apple now) don&#x27;t have the capabilities and resources to design a processor which can implement the ARM ISA.<p>Either provide a citation that proves that Apple hasn&#x27;t designed their own core implementing the ARM ISA, or stop demanding some from my claim, which has a lot more evidence behind it.<p>The fact that they have dual sourced CPUs from TSMC and Samsung, which are on different processor nodes, thus requiring a different layout and mask, tells me that Apple&#x27;s hardware engineers absolutely know what they&#x27;re doing, and can design the internals of a chip:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-i...</a><p>Plus, around the time of the PA Semi acquisition, news outlets reported that the engineers were working on a custom CPU for Apple devices:\n<a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/15/apples_pa_semi_working_on_arm_chip_for_next_gen_iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/08/09/15/apples_pa_semi_wor...</a><p>I honestly don&#x27;t know why I put so much time into refuting this.

The patterns we see today in the Middle East go back to around 1900 or so with attempts of imperialists to hit them, divide them, turn them into indentured servants, and take their resources. Combine that with religious, ethnic, power-related, and financial aspects over decades to get a huge mess. So, I&#x27;d be looking at money, power, religion, and typical politics as a start.<p>Looking at that, I see the same trends that relate to violent regime change and terrorism over there that I always see. It usually involves a Western power (esp U.S.) covertly screwing with a country to cause a regime change or battles between them + eastern country (esp Russia) for influence/resources. The radical ideology and funding put in by Saudi Arabia comes into play. The damage and power vacuums from an invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan fuels it, literally with fuel & weapons. ;) Arab Spring and aftermath of that may have been the final straw setting things in motion.<p>All in all, looks more like Western imperialism, local dictatorships, and religious sect (esp Saudi-promoted) combining to create a disaster that leads to many innocents being beaten, raped, tortured, and murdered over there with a few in the West, too. Same stuff, same area, different country and year.<p>And, unlike international media, most of the Western media is consistently avoiding the U.S. imperialism and Saudi Arabia angles. Just like they did for Iraq. Just like for 9/11. The problem isn&#x27;t income inequality: it&#x27;s countries sabotaging other countries with corrupt ideology, covert actions, and overt war.

There is very little opportunity. But low opportunity is coupled with generally high education and literacy rates and a massive population boom. A young population, unemployed intellectuals, and authoritarian government has <i>always</i> led to revolution. Always. It&#x27;s human nature. It&#x27;s happened at points in European history, and it&#x27;s happened in China and Japan and elsewhere.<p>As a musician, I play some middle eastern music and own several instruments from the region. I have a doumbek (cast aluminum goblet drum) from the well-known GEF in Egypt, and another from Syria. The difference in construction quality is shocking. When showing the Syrian drum to people, I sometimes say &quot;You&#x27;ve heard about the precision industrial powerhouses of Syrian manufacturing, right? No? Here&#x27;s why.&quot; But what&#x27;s even more shocking is the difference in the quality of the &quot;good&quot; Egyptian drum versus pretty much any instrument made in China or Indonesia these days - CNC-milled parts, quality finishes, and tight construction rule in even the cheapest Asian manufacturing.<p>Manufacturing in the Arab world, such as it is, is mostly trapped in the 19th century, unable to escape craftsman roots. This is terribly inefficient and unproductive. The Arab world is technologically incapable of manufacturing complex devices like cars and surface-mount electronics. And it&#x27;s not for lack of educated people or a desire to do better. Other forces are at play here.<p>Revenue from raw resource extraction (oil) is just exploitation, and it&#x27;s time-locked. Sooner or later, oil fields run dry, and they&#x27;ll be back where they started, basically just agricultural communities. It&#x27;s a shame, because the region and cultures there have provided some of the most important advances in history (like the number zero and algebra), and I&#x27;m sure it could rise to that effectiveness again, given the right conditions.<p>But oil exploitation is good for both the local authoritarian regimes, and for the western powers that run their economies on cheap Arab oil. That leads to a massive militarization and government-level resistance to modernization and advancement. It sucks. In a way, oil is the worst thing to happen to the middle east.<p>And who has an answer? Clearly, the world of desert kingdoms and post-fascist Baathist regimes is ripe for revolution. But the answers seem to be either go forward, into the scary world of modern relatively peaceful democracy and freedom, or backwards into the glory days of centuries ago. And the Islamic fundamentalists who want to go backwards are strengthened by the general lack of interest in the west for real democratization, and the preference for petty regimes we can control from afar.<p>Sigh.",1448917665

I think the Planned Parenthood shooting is due to a combination of mental illness and lack of education.  I don&#x27;t think it really matters which crazy ideology you pick, you can use it to justify your actions.  And if the crazy, uneducated, people weren&#x27;t shooting up a Planned Parenthood, they would be shooting up a theater, or a school, or any number of other places.  The solution is to educate kids and to treat the mentally ill.<p>Why does this tiny group of Muslims commit hate crimes, while the vast majority do not?

Nor would you look for employment there if you weren&#x27;t from the area.<p>> This is a great region to start a family, and at the end of the day, your best employees are the ones tied to your office and location, not mercenary college grads shopping around every couple years for a raise.<p>In other words, you take what you can get from the local hiring pool and hope your best people don&#x27;t have better options. This is great if you&#x27;re looking to bootstrap a small business, but once you get past that stage it can be difficult to recruit executives with the market savvy you need to a small town.

My point here is that in the late 1960s, international diplomacy was respected enough to be part of the pop culture conversation. Fifty years later, teh pop culture conversation centres around popular violence (mass shootings) and terrorism, like ISIS. It seems to me that in the past, people had hopes for the future and believed the politicians were working to make a better world. Today, they don&#x27;t believe that and see how politicians have created a world were some people are above the law and the rest of us are considered irrelevant and to be placated with realty-tv entertainment.<p>When inequality leads to hopelessness, what are we to honestly expect?",1448917206

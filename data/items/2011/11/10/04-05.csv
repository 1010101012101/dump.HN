(He's more of a bulldog than Zinga ever was.)<p>On the other, in any company as big as Zynga there are people who coast along and don't really earn their shares. Zynga isn't trying to take back what's vested, just clamping down on future shares for people who aren't doing a great job, maybe playing a lesser role than they were originally hired for. That seems like a perfectly valid thing to do -- in fact it's only fair to the employees who are pulling their weight.",1320901124

This isn't news, but I think the fact that it's widely understood is new within the past year or so.<p>Also, supporting multiple platforms tends to linearly multiply costs.<p>Also, good web based mobile apps are getting ""more possible"" with new technologies so there are reactions kind of like what this author seems to be saying is a done deal. The idea that mobile apps are dead is totally absurd. I mean, ask anyone on Android who's used maps.google.com on their phone (which is totally amazing) whether they have uninstalled the Google Maps app - it's just not happening.<p>There are two things that are important that the author seems to be ignoring - first is the fact that developing a good mobile web based app isn't easy or cheap either. The costs of supporting a gajillion mobile device web browsers and form factors won't multiply directly with the number of platforms out there, but there will be many, many platform/browser/form-factor specific bugs and annoyances to deal with. Second is the fact that regardless of how awesome canvas / mojito / etc. all get, afaik there is no model in the future where mobile web-based apps have an ability to do something like interact with the local data sitting on the device in other formats (like people / calendar) or with other devices that the mobile app developer can take advantage of (bump / beam).

That is basically the point I am trying to make but its a complex issue and hard to fit into a few comments. Unless a field has a licensing / credentialed program to qualify for employment (from my understanding this is the case in the ""hard"" engineering fields) then its my opinion that companies should not be allowed to essentially freeze out Americans who do not hold degrees (but have relevant experience) while, at the same time, importing foreign workers who have foreign degrees. If they don't want to hire people without degrees, that is their own decision to make, but they shouldn't get a ""bail out"" at the same time by using the ""degree argument"" to justify importing cheaper labor.",1320898288

The attitude expressed in your posts reeks of pride in ignorance. It's like you genuinely don't care what the truth might be, but don't want anybody to believe this could be anything close to it. You blast the study you didn't read as ""unscientific trash"" and yet rail against preconceptions while vividly illuminating your own. I did not think you were stupid, but I won't deny I think this thread a singular parade of foolishness.<p><i>Don't just imply that I'm stupid</i><p>I'm was not implying that you're stupid. Perhaps I should have said ""don't"" instead of ""can't"" understand. There may be many reasons why you don't see those interactions you call harassment as competitive that don't involve you being stupid. For instance: your definition of ""competition"" may have a much narrower scope than the one meant. You may also be conflating competition with antagonism or hostility, which doesn't necessarily follow.<p><i>explain to me what the competition actually is</i><p>The salesman has an incentive to get you buy, and when you buy, to spend more, because then he gets paid more. This is at cross purposes with your desire to spend less while still getting only what you want and nothing you don't want.<p>In a sense is a competition over your money, but as the salesman does not attempt to physically pry the money from your hands, it can better be though of as a competition over your will.<p>(All of this is more evident in situations where directly haggling over price is permitted. If you wanted an avenue with which to consider cultural factors, the variable global popularity of haggling vs. fixed prices would be one. But the basically competitive nature of bargaining in general seems, with the sole exception of you, to be uncontroversial.)<p><i>and why I am automatically triggered into participating just because I have a penis.</i><p>That's a straw man under construction. Nobody said anything about being ""automatically triggered"" or about having a penis causing you do anything. You're injecting your own preconceptions about what the cited study claims, just as you injected the scenario of dealing with salespeople.<p><i>I think I am attacking a piece of tenuous and speculative suggestion the author has made.</i><p>What you think and what you've written appear to be at odds. You attacked an entire field of study[1] and singled out the authors[2] of the particular study on the basis of <i>the blogger's interpretation</i>[3] of that study, which you didn't read[4], while providing no evidence at all beyond personally disagreeing with the implication that human behavior might have something to do with the human body.<p>The reason I call this a ""monumentally tired argument"" is that it's been lashed out like a giant reactionary noodle against every bit of evidence ever recorded that human behavior is anything more complicated than the things humans are consciously aware of then they behave.<p>[1]:""The entire field is known for making stuff up in a manner that is consistent with the cultural background and expectations of the study's authors.""\n[2]: (I can't actually quote this because you edited your post to remove the part where you claimed the entire blog post was about selling Cialdini's book.)\n[3]: ""...showed that men seem more responsive to email because it bypasses their competitive tendencies."" (<i>Which the study doesn't actually conclude.</i>)\n[4]: ""It costs $11 to read that thing and I assure you, nobody has read it (except maybe now that I said it out of spite).

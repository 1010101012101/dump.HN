I'm the principal software engineer at a university with a commitment to diversity, and my team consists of 7 men and 6 women (3 developers, 1 dba, 2 QE).  We're an agile workplace, so every day we have several meetings, including the stand-up, code reviews, and meetings with our partners.  I don't think anyone is into gaming, but you might find the baby talk tedious (2 of us are pregnant, myself with twins, and virtually everyone has a family).  The elusive ""human touch,"" feels intrinsic to this job.  However, it took me a long time to find the ideal workplace, so I fully understand your frustration.<p>For years, I was the one&only technical woman in the different companies I worked for.  That can be very difficult, especially in a start-up environment where (depending on the culture), the atmosphere can be as sexually charged as a college dorm.  I've had supervisors hit on me & grope me at parties. Another boss told me he was going to replace me with a nice, docile set of Geisha programmers, or sell me into white slavery if the start-up folded.  The new sales guy at one place asked me to get him coffee, and when I explained that wasn't my job, he said I was ""too hot to be a programmer.""  I was not flattered.<p>And then there are the message boards where hoards of young men post their opinions about women being intrinsically incapable of hacking.

And those enclosures violate the spec in more than one way: first of all, pretty much all drives require a spin-up current of around 1000 mA, which is twice what current USB can provide.

The GPL (just one example of many possible licenses for open source software) requires that GPL-licensed projects have the source code available in the preferred format, an important distinction that is not necessarily present in all open source licenses. A developer could provide an assembler dump of their code, and claim that was open source, and walk away with the payment.<p>Worse, of course, they could just do a slideware demo, or they could do a demo using Microsoft Word, but claiming that it was software they had written.<p>Also you claim to be more centered on normal users, but normal users don't know or care about open source. To them, they just want the program. Yes, open source gives them benefits too, but they don't know that, nor do they really want to know.<p>As a developer, I would feel hesitant about committing much time to a project - it would be huge gamble. On a normal open source project, I could get things started, get the code base maybe 80% done, and then when that last 20% needs to be done (which in reality is actually 80% of the work ;-)) others typically would be pitching in, to the point where I could even walk away and development would continue without me, ensuring my initial work was not wasted, and ensuring the project got done. But with your site, the developer risks that the ""normal users"" will see any rough edges and deliver a total rejection - binary thumbs down - and I won't get paid. So it forces me to do way more work, and even then, the users can still say no based on some arbitrary whim - ""I like the OK button on the left, not the right, this sucks!"" - that's just an example; please don't bother trying to debunk it unless you can address the more general point.<p>All that being said, I could be wrong!

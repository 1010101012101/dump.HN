31198,comment,30789,30859,0,0,especkman,,,"Why is that the obvious implication, especially whith the two home-run examples he gives?<p>Starbucks and Microsoft are built on smaller transactions than one would expect from enterprise software. Starbucks does it $3 at a time.  Microsoft established itself selling desktop software for for a few hundred a pop, and for quite a while, it was selling a couple of copies at a time until they gained enough momentum to sell their desktop software to whole departments and later even whole enterprises.<p>Interesting to consider that the average annual revenue Starbucks gets from a regular customer, is probably similar, or even a bit more than the annual revenue Microsoft gets per-seat from its best enterprise customers.  A reminder that one should balance the difficulty of acquiring a customer against the lifetime value of that customer.<p>Getting $1 from a million people might be a tough business, but getting $20/year from 50,000 people one dollar at a time is conceivable.<p>Flickr might be a good example (though a little on the big side). When they were acquired by Yahoo, just a little over a year from their debut, they already had ~400,000 registered users.  Within a few more months, they had a million, and a few months after that a million more.  I'd postulate that nearly all of that post-acquisition growth (and much more) came from existing momentum rather than their association with Yahoo.<p>I don't know if the same ratios held back then, but when I looked a few months back, about 15% of flickr accounts were flickr pro accounts bringing in $24.95 in annual revenue.  Thats 300,000 x $24.95, or $7M in annual revenue, just from pro accounts.  <p>Margins were low, or negative, because they were going for growth, but they had various knobs they could twiddle.  First off, a little after the Yahoo acquisition they cut the pro subscription price (by half, I believe).  In addition, they controlled the amount of storage and upload bandwidth available to both free and pro account holders.  Taken together these variables gave them latitude in picking margins.  Even a relatively paltry 13% margin would have generated $1M in profit.<p><p>",1182972880

A leader based economically on a pile of sand (ads) If FB fails, it will scare the market and poof! There goes your ""2.0 boom"".<p>I'm not looking at FB from a consumer's perspective, I'm looking at it from an investment/business perspective. <p>Being that you're still in college, you should keep in mind that many of us have experienced this same exact phenomenon   before.",1182972496

I imagine, if anything, the iPhone has made Meebo more of a competitor to Heysan than before, given that the iPhone comes with a fully working web browser.<p>But congrats to Heysan on a great press hit and a great product!",1182972304
31195,comment,31115,31115,0,0,enriketuned,,,"""I find the concept of the long detour fascinating.It says that the company believed strongly in the original vision, but recognized that the time was not ripe to realize the plan."" Recognized that the time was not ripe? Personally I don't see the point of this article. What concept is he talking about? They have the idea - they raise 80m $ - they try - does not take off. Fine. They ""scale down""- ""re-evaluate"" their ""product line"" - find something that sells - survive on that. Ok. Then they sell that something that sells to concentrate on the original idea (which they had not given up upon but had ""maintained"" all these years). Reads like a marketing effort. I don't see the point. So I suggest: Unless you consider ""a long detour"" a fascinating concept - Timing is still everything.  ",1182972261

This case may be small, but it's a symptom of a type of thinking that is gaining prevalence - the same type of thinking that caught us in version 1.0 with our pants down.",1182972240

But this talk is awesome, because it has a lot of interesting observations and not nearly as many doubtful conclusions.

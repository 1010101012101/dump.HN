1714991,comment,1712466,1714089,0,0,Cushman,,,"I was being pedantic in saying that ideas are real. An idea is the subjective experience of a brain state; there's nothing extra-real about that. It's not really possible to <i>own</i> an idea, but then if you deconstruct ownership, it's not really possible to own <i>anything</i>; all ""property"" is a legal fiction, so that by itself is a dead end.<p>Now, personally, I believe having access to more information is better than less. Purely on utilitarian grounds, I feel like I've seen pretty strong arguments that short-term patents and copyrights are great at incentivizing creation, which then lapses to the public creating greater good for all. Our IP system may be pretty broken, but that's a different subject.<p>You seem to be opposing IP categorically because of a moral judgment, but I don't understand what the principle is. You clearly have <i>some</i> consequentialist concerns, but they don't extend far enough to, say, allow a developer to earn a living by selling software. What's the moral value here?<p>More on point, why doesn't the same thing apply to physical property? Why is it okay for the government to tell you you're not allowed to drive ""my"" car, but not for them to tell you you're not allowed to reprint ""my"" book?",1285123015

Sending a Thank You letter in the mail takes a bit of effort. Consider a job fair where a recruiter gets a hundred resumes. Could sending a sincere Thank You note in the mail possibly make you stand out from the crowd? Most especially in these days of longer hiring cycles where the difference between a minute of effort to send an email and the ten minutes to write, print, sign (with blue ink to contrast from black printer ink), and mail might make a difference.<p>There is a better site and a book, <a href=""http://collegegrad.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collegegrad.com</a> that really exposed the behind-the-scenes of hiring because it was written by a hiring manager. Pretty much everything I'm saying here has been paraphrased. As the site says, the secret to an effective Thank You letter is to restate your interest in the position after thanking them and most important have a future promise to follow-up: ""I will call you next Wednesday at 3pm to discuss this further"" Even if you don't get the person on the line, by calling when you said you would - you earn professional credibility.",1285121628

Each of us loses what we owned before, each of us owns something new.<p>That's obviously not how information works, though.<p>An iPhone costs $600. Possessing an iPhone gives you, in theory, the capability to make new iPhones. However, the right to make your own iPhone would cost a <i>lot</i> more (if anyone would sell it at all). The difference falls under the umbrella of ""intellectual property"", and it's a lot of things; trademarks, copyrights, patents, probably lots of little trade secrets that aren't patentable, but nobody else has figured out yet.<p>To be explicit, of course, the <i>ideas</i> themselves don't have value. The value is the exclusive right to execution of the ideas, which is provided by the government. That's no different from physical possessions, though; my car would not be worth very much to me if I didn't have the right to exclusive control of my car guaranteed me by the government.<p>The point being this: You want to buy my gizmo. However, you've previously told me that when you get your hands on it, you're going to immediately take it apart, figure out how it works, and tell other people so they can make their own without coming to me. Obviously in this case, I don't gain from selling you the gizmo at any price— in fact it's probably worth a lot to me to keep you from getting one.<p>So either we both stick to our guns — you don't get a gizmo, I don't get any money, both of us are unhappy — or we <i>compromise</i>. I say, you can have it if you promise not to open it. You say you can't make that promise. I say, okay, I guess I don't mind if you open it as long as you don't tell anyone else what's inside. Since you're willing to make that sacrifice, I'm willing to let you have a gizmo for $50.<p>That's one way the conversation could go. There are a lot of other ways, as illustrated by the thousands of different ways there are to license IP— say I agree to let you make copies of the gizmo, but only for yourself, not to sell. Or I agree to let you tell people how it works, but only if you tell them that I made it originally. All of those things have value to me, and if their value isn't properly represented by your barter, I won't make the trade.<p>This is a hairy question— I sure don't have the answer to it. My only real point is that when we're talking about something so fascinatingly complex and delicate, you're doing yourself a real disservice going with your gut based on ""fairness"".",1285121537

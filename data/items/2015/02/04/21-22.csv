The observations surrounding structurelessness suggest that <i>true anarchy is impossible</i>. In the absence of some type of hierarchy one will emerge anyways. The notion of a group of true equals with no authority over one another is a pipe dream.<p>Not to mention the notion of defined hierarchies makes no statement on <i>what</i> the hierarchy looks like, nor the system that determines who goes where.<p>Corporate structures <i>are</i> frequently democratic. The Board of a company is very explicitly such a structure. Not to mention that even without explicit democratic structures managers still answer to those they have authority over due to market forces (nothing says &quot;you suck as a manager&quot; like your team quitting). In this industry in particular, it&#x27;s very, <i>very</i> hard to build an authoritarian bureaucracy.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re getting the authoritarian/anarchy divide from, that wasn&#x27;t in any way implied by my post, nor do I believe either extreme is possible in our industry.",1423087197

9000244,comment,8995696,9000098,0,0,mdeeks,,,"It depends on the use case. For high level overview of systems you absolutely want fewer graphs. Agreed there. For deep dives into &quot;Why is this server/cluster running like crap!?&quot; having much more (all?) of the information right there to browse makes a big difference. I originally went for fewer graphs separated into multiple pages you had to navigate to and no one liked it. In the end we adopted both philosophies for each use case.<p>Lots of lines on a single graphs helps you notice imbalances you may not have noticed before. For example if a small subset of your cluster has lower CPU usage then you likely have a load balancing problem or something else weird going on.<p>RE: Sharding\nWhat happens when a single server can no longer hold the load of the subsystem? You have to shard that subsystem further by something random and arbitrary. It requires manual work to decide how to shard. Once you have too much data and too many servers that need monitoring, manual sharding becomes cumbersome. It&#x27;s already cumbersome in Graphite since expanding a carbon-cache cluster requires moving data around since the hashing changes.",1423087071

The current US sentencing system is geared towards very high sentences though (anomalously high by just about any standards except perhaps China&#x27;s). So it would require a fairly major reform to fix. Right now if anyone is convicted of a felony in a federal court it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy for the sentencing range to be decades, which is made worse by the fact that there are really a lot of federal felonies (and some of them are broadly written).<p>One of the political/philosophical reasons is that the U.S. seems fonder than many countries of a retribution-based model of justice, where the goal of imprisoning someone is not only to protect society and dissuade future would-be criminals, but to &quot;punish&quot; them in a metaphysical sense. Many European countries have shifted in the past half-century to a more utilitarian model, in which the goal of the prison system is seen as almost purely targeted at reducing crimes. From that perspective, imprisoning people for particularly long periods of time often doesn&#x27;t end up as a very appealing solution, admittedly depending strongly on how you weight factors.",1423086125

It is a topic close to my heart because I was partly homeschooled, and I have seen firsthand some of the sad deficiencies that can dog homeschooled kids:<p>1. Lazy teaching – parents being unwilling to devote 4-6 hours each day to education. Homeschooling is a commitment that should be treated with the same gravitas as a full-time working position, but many parents have trouble maintaining this mentality over many years of education. This leads to kids that, although they might be bright, just haven&#x27;t been taught much, which makes them seem dull.<p>2. Inherited ignorance – if the parents don’t know or care much about history, unbiased politics, mathematics, literature, etc. then the kids won’t either. Obviously, the parent can make a commitment to learn the field at least to a high school level so they can educate their kids, but often this commitment falls through. Because of that, homeschooled kids can lack a multidimensional perspective of the world.<p>3. Neuroticism – some parents have a tendency to like to make decisions for their children. This can be very dangerous for homeschooled kids, because they don’t learn how to think for themselves or make mistakes.<p>4. Social gracelessness – a lot of homeschooled kids have very little interaction with their peers. School can provide social acclimatization that parents often don’t know how to give their kids. Especially if the kid is naturally shy, since parents rarely want to put their kids in a social situation where they are uncomfortable. Unfortunately, this can just exacerbate the issue, to the extent that the kids have nervous breakdowns when they finally do have to engage their peers (yes, I&#x27;ve seen this happen).<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. I don&#x27;t want to say that it&#x27;s impossible for one person (usually, it&#x27;s just one parent that is home during the day) to provide a well-rounded education to their kids, just that it&#x27;s hard -- very, very hard. You need to help your kids make friends, and you need to let them be independent. You need to be a committed and capable educator, and you need to give them a dynamic education with diverse experience, not just doing workbooks in the house. Some people are good at this -- they are natural teachers. Other people find it much, much harder.",1423086086

Do your personal best, and THEN look at ways to improve it, and in one facet at a time.  Otherwise, you might not always understand why the &quot;best&quot; way is better.  (You won&#x27;t appreciate source control until you lose All The Things, but ... I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re already using Git. ;))<p>There are nigh-infinite blog posts about ways youcan do X better (unit test, standards, unicode compliance, date handling, names, design, CSS, layout, etc) -- don&#x27;t worry about those yet.<p>=== Coding on your own ===<p>Consider writing code to solve programming puzzles, like Project Euler -- it can often start small, and then improve as you learn more.<p>Consider building a &quot;simple&quot; toy project in a web framework -- Django, Flask, etc. (I mention those as they are some Python frameworks.)  There are often tutorials that run you through building something toy-scale. (Your own twitter, a TODO app, etc).  Doing this will let you quickly build something with a simple UI, and simple guts, and then you can look into ways to improve it.<p>For example, I&#x27;d like to make a flash card game for my kids.  (Real project, tired dad. ;))  I can start with some code that randomly generates problems, and shows them to a UI in a pretty way. (Large font, perhaps.)  Later on I can improve it with things like letting people enter the answer, tracking how long it takes to answer, tracking scores over time (so that I can focus on the ones they have problems with), leaderboards, and custom decks.  ALL of those are way out of scope of the initial project though.<p>=== Coding with others ===<p>If you&#x27;d like more of a challenge, or in some ways less, try being a contributor to a larger project, rather than trying to write something totally from scratch. This is really important -- most of us are not writing Large Software solo.  I might write a handy tool solo, but most of my day-to-day work (and the environment in which I do most of my learning) is maintaining a larger codebase.<p>Existing projects already have a build framework, a code review protocol, RPC/API infrastructure, GUI, etc already done for you.  They have a test suite that tells you if you broke something.  Now, your improvements are things like, &quot;Add an error message when this happens&quot;, or &quot;Add support for a new API call...&quot;.  It&#x27;s MUCH easier to add something similar to what someone else already wrote (once you understand how it works by reading their code ;)), than it is to have to write all of that infrastructure yourself.  There are also OTHER developers who have domain knowledge of the codebase, and that you can ask for help -- this is VERY useful and important for our learning as programmers.<p>=== Direction ===<p>I have no idea how to help you there. ;) It&#x27;s easy to feel inadequate in this profession, as there are always smarter/faster people.  Since what we can create is endless, it&#x27;s hard to PICK something -- that&#x27;s why I suggest doing a tutorial-based project in a web framework. You can then use that to focus on the Python side, or on the UI side, or as inspiration/guidance for making your own things.<p>Also, don&#x27;t worry about looking at Stack Overflow. Definitely do that if you&#x27;re stuck on something, or you forget whether something is possible (&quot;Can I declare a dict plus it&#x27;s members in Java the way I can in Python?&quot;).  It can at times be hard to tell when the answer you find on SO doesn&#x27;t match the problem you really have, though, which takes practice.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to talk more via e-mail if you like.

His high school (Valhalla High School in El Cajon California) gave him a test to determine his aptitude that said he should go into &quot;building maintenance&quot; (being a Janitor more or less) and wouldn&#x27;t move up his classes to more difficult ones so he was in classes with kids who didn&#x27;t really want to be there and were continually disruptive.<p>Looking for a solution for this problem I found Grossmont Middle College which is a high school on a 2 year college campus.  My son was able to get into that and finished high school with about 34 units in college classes most of which transferred to the 4 year university he now attends (University of North Dakota... why he wants to move from California to the freezing cold I have no idea!).<p>Common Core can&#x27;t fix the segregation of high schools between the rich high performing kids and everyone else who isn&#x27;t allowed into the higher level of learning at schools.  Every school is essentially 2 schools and if you don&#x27;t get into the right classes you are screwed big time.<p>Reading the article, personally I see what is wrong in schools more about getting kids to where they want to be in life.

Unjust behaviour may lead to unfavorable circumstances which make it easier to commit more unjust behavior, but nevertheless the freedom not to commit unjust behavior remains.<p>Within the Pali suttas: In the Anguttara Nikaya, it is stated that karmic results are experienced either in this life (P. diṭṭadhammika) or in a future lives (P. samparāyika).

In my own experience I have a mutli-user networking system written in JavaScript and a library in C#. To reimplement the same things in JavaScript in C# is a huge amount of code bloat. I have to make classes and meta classes and all kinds of other indirection just so I can make an Event system that is generic.

Hell you probably get 80~90% of that in a structurally typed language (OCaml objects, Go).<p>> In JavaScript you can build objects on the fly.<p>Which you can do in many other languages, including statically typed ones. Here&#x27;s an object in Ocaml:<p><pre><code>    # let s = object\n        val mutable v = [0; 2]\n\n        method pop =\n          match v with\n          | hd :: tl -> \n            v <- tl;\n            Some hd\n          | [] -> None\n\n        method push hd = \n          v <- hd :: v\n      end\n</code></pre>\nAnd that&#x27;s statically typed.<p>> The problem with &#x27;class&#x27; in ES6 is that it will prevent people from learning this new, easier, faster, simpler way of working because instead they just bring the classical baggage to JavaScript.<p>That&#x27;s patent nonsense, not to mention ES6&#x27;s class shortcuts apply to object literals as well, the only thing the class statement does is remove the bullshit and mostly useless boilerplate Javascript <i>demands</i> when creating a reusable prototype due to it being a garbage language, and its &quot;prototypal&quot; object system being there not because it&#x27;s good and going to save the masses but because it was the easiest way to have an object system working in a week.

The problem is that massive storage is only as good as your ability to encode/decode into it.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear: this work encoded just 5.27 megabits.  It&#x27;s stored in what&#x27;s basically a large molecular hash table where each piece of key-value data is replicated a million times for redundancy.  Each piece then read 100x to correct for the -abundant- errors in each piece.  So they encoded less than a megabyte.<p>The problem with encoding information into DNA is that writing serial polymers accurately is difficult and slow.  In this paper they&#x27;re using an inkjet printed DNA array.  It takes a day to make them, resulting in a bandwidth of:<p>(5.27 Mbits) / (24x60x60 sec) = 66 bits/sec<p>Reading is a little faster.  The fastest system, the HiSeq 2500 reads 120Gbits raw in 27 hours.  Factoring in the necessary 100x redundancy, one has a -maximum- read rate of:<p>(120 Gbits / 100) / (27x60x60 sec) = 12 Kbits / sec<p>So for 5.5 petabits it would take 16,000 years to write the data into a cubic mm but only 16 years to read it at the current rate.<p>If we get a little scifi, and assume we build programmable\npolymerases and get nanopore (direct read) sequencing.  Even then, physics limits you to something like 1000 read/writes per sec per pore/polymerase.  Instrumenting to these will probably limit per-feature size to being larger than 100micron on a fabricated chip, giving us an ultimate read/write limit around:<p>(2cm/100um)^2 x 1000 bit/sec = 40Mbit/sec<p>for a giant 2cmx2cm chip.  With the necessary error-correction and redundancy, it&#x27;s probably going to cap out around 1Mbit/sec at best.<p>Those 700TB take about 2months to read/write at these rates, and we&#x27;ll have much-better solid state storage technologies by the time we figure out how to all that with DNA.",1423084936

If science were still conducted equally in German, Russian, French and English, up and coming scientists in China, Japan, etc. would have to learn four languages to keep up with their field instead of just English. Conversely, assuming such newcomers rise to the forefront of their field, they might choose to publish in their own language, foisting a new language on everyone else.<p>One aspect of English that the author overlooks completely is how welcoming it is of new words. French, for example, has the &quot;Académie française&quot;, which is an institution charged with maintaining the purity of the French language.  This means resisting change and controlling the vocabulary in use. There are dictionaries for English, but those who maintain them simply try to keep up with common usage, not <i>control</i> what becomes common usage.

But that won&#x27;t be an easy process and will likely result in a lot more protests and violence than the alternatives.<p>The naive ideal would be that customers force the businesses to pressure the suppliers to improve the situation, but outside a few marketing stunts I don&#x27;t think that is very likely. All previous calls for boycotts have been unsuccessful and the average citizen doesn&#x27;t care enough about these issues to do anything politically (aside from the obvious difficulty of out-lobbying the established lobbies).<p>We&#x27;ll see.",1423084514

All of this depends on the judge and how s/he would like to handling the sentencing portion of this trial, which probably will not happen for weeks or months.<p>As there was no plea agreement accepted by the defendant, it is quite likely that the prosecution has always believes that he would be found guilty and pay a very high price for his crimes.

I started with a single screen that showed some text and added a few more screens that had the same text. Then I added a button that triggered a change of that text.

And GUI/web is pretty bare-minimum when it comes to keeping people interested in programming. Not a whole lot of people want to write console applications anymore.<p>Here&#x27;s the sticking points where beginners need your help, and might not even have enough information to actually ask what they&#x27;re looking for:<p>What framework do I use?

Or bringing political wars into it. &quot;Don&#x27;t learn C# because M$&quot;. Beginners don&#x27;t care about your politics, they want to learn. Eventually people settle on Python, so the beginner starts learning Python, then asks &quot;what GUI framework&quot; or &quot;how do I deploy Django&quot; and we start back at the top of this list.<p>So, in the midst of all of this confusion happening for a beginner, they&#x27;re (understandably) lost and ask for a lighthouse to guide them on a path, any path, as long as they don&#x27;t have to make the choices themselves.

Plenty of America&#x27;s arable land lies fallow or has condos built atop it.<p>I will say however that it seems some of our large food supply sources may be in danger and the economic and human cost of pivoting a food supply chain will be astronomical.",1423083654

Doing the same task every working hour for years isn&#x27;t inherently a bad thing. That describes a lot of jobs and some would actually find that kind of job perfectly acceptable.<p>The problem is only when this is the only job available to you and the money it makes is so low you&#x27;re effectively locked into it and the working conditions are so bad you have a good chance of death or injury and there&#x27;s really no hope you can improve your situation (or that of your children) of your own accord.<p>Like Sisyphus, it&#x27;s not the job itself, it&#x27;s the hopelessness of ever succeeding.

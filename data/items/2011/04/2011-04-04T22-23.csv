the other thing is you don't need a UX person full time. you need a UX person to manage someone doing your wireframes and then manage a designer to make them look cool.
frankly, i don't see any way around outsourcing UX for a startup. your and their risk is too high to join forces. you'd waste their time. they'd waste your money.",1301957483

Like all design the problems occur when you ask a designer to step in towards the end of a project, when all the fundamental mechanics are locked down.<p>Good design can improve things at any stage.

2408900,comment,2406206,2408457,1,0,gwern,,,"From Gregory Clark's _Farewell to Alms_:<p>> However, in preindustrial England, and indeed in many preindustrial economies, inflation rates were low by modern standards. Figure 8.7 shows the English inflation rate from 1200 to 2000 over successive forty-year intervals. Before 1914 inflation rates rarely exceeded 2 percent per year, even in the period known as the Price Revolution, when the influx of silver from the New World helped drive up prices. In a country such as England, which had a highly regarded currency in the preindustrial era, the crown did not avail itself of the inflation tax, despite the close restrictions Parliament placed on its other tax revenues. Only in the twentieth century did significant inflation appear in England. By the late twentieth century annual inflation averaged 48 percent per year. Thus there has been a decline, not an improvement, in the quality of monetary management in England since the Industrial Revolution.

Our design was done by a separate designer though (he did 3 different styles that we offer in a handful of colours so customers can choose).<p>The key was to provide good and prompt feedback, which resulted in improvements to entries.  Communicate and be appreciative of their effort and it seems to go a long way (doesn't it always though? :).<p>We also looked at designs from other contests and sent messages with ""hey I like your designs!"" to designers who were really good, and that seemed to help get a few top-notch designers onto our contests too.<p>I've since recommended this approach to several other companies I work with, and they've been very happy with using 99designs as well now.",1221083908

We have nothing to prove or disprove, there is no creationist theory, 2+2=5 is not a theory! And if god exists(we can't be sure) isn't it possible that he created the universe, so that life can spontaneously emerge and evolve? Im not religious at all, but evolution doesn't disprove god(nothing does, and nothing proves it either), it just disproofs creationism. And here is a good question: Who created god?",1221083895

This was writing device driver assembler routines and image processing code.<p>The second period, I was implementing a prototype of a distributed OS, about 10% of a 3 inch thick spec which defined the whole thing down to the level of small procedures, with a hard 6 month deadline (which was what I had estimated the job would take). I worked steadily for that 6 months on a 40 hour schedule, and finished about two weeks before the demo was given.<p>I'm currently reading <i>On Lisp</i> and <i>The Four-Gated City</i> (by Doris Lessing), for whatever that's worth.",1221083730

300785,comment,300728,300738,0,0,catone,,,"I'm probably biased, because I work for SitePoint (which owns 99designs -- though I have nothing to do with that part of the operation), but have also previously owned a design contest site (GFXcontests.com).  I'm not so sure it is bad for the design industry.<p>Reasons why it's good:<p>1. It provides portfolio building opportunities and real-world client experience for new designers<p>2. It provides hobbyists a good way to try their hand at professional work<p>3. If the contest holder (client) holds up their end of the bargain and provides all entries with quality feedback, it provides useful practice for designers.<p>4. I've heard from a large number of designers that participating in design contests led to more visibility for their portfolios and in turn helped them land regular, non-contest employees<p>5. I can say with confidence that a number of designers on 99designs at least are earning healthy five-figure incomes from contest work<p>6. Many designers are able to sell losing designs as templates (though contest holders should be careful to put in a stipulation that designers should only be allowed to do that once they remove your name/IP from the design)... or they can repurpose the designs for another contest or client<p>Why it might be bad:<p>1. The No-Spec people will say it takes paid opportunities away from designers (I might rebut that it gives more designers the opportunity to compete for work and make a name for themselves -- and that no top tier designer I know is struggling for work)<p>2. They'll also say that it is unfair for designers -- who are asked to create work with no guarantee that they'll be paid (the rebuttal here: if you don't want to work that way, don't participate -- and as I said above, losing designers can still often make some money from that effort)<p>Just my (perhaps biased) two cents.",1221083208

300774,comment,300728,300731,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We used 99designs (formerly SitePoint Contests) for two logos with good results.

I've been told by several designers that contests are offensive...but I've found it <i>really</i> hard to hire a designer that I work with regularly, at any price.  Designers, I suppose, being creative types, aren't often strong on on-time delivery, responding in a reasonable time to queries and requests, etc.  I've never yet found a designer that I could count on, who also does good work, despite many attempts.  (And I'm not cheap.  When I have run contests, the prizes we offer are always the highest on the site at the time--and I've regularly paid ""going rates"" for icon work and other bits of design.  Nonetheless, keeping a designer focused on our projects has been extremely difficult.)<p>Anyway, I think design contests provide large corporation style design workflow for small companies.  Design firms often work on spec for large companies, at least for the initial pitch.  I don't think it's a bad thing to bring that kind of process to small businesses.",1221081888

I'd say maybe 20% of the startups I know personally are using Ruby, with the rest divided amongst PHP, Python, Java, and Perl (not necessarily in that order, though PHP is definitely at the top of the list by a large margin).  Since RoR started gaining traction about three years ago, and RoR is still not the leading platform, the notion that Erlang could even become a contender (much less the leader) in two years is more than a little ridiculous.<p>Not to mention the fact that there's only one language at this point that is <i>inevitably</i> going to grow really rapidly in popularity (JavaScript).

Try out some TDD - Test Drive Development (TDD) makes for better code.<p>No. Define your target. Code to it. Deploy. Then test.</i><p>You're both right.  One of the points of tools like RSpec is to make the ""define your target"" step and the ""test"" step so close as to be indistinguishable, thus killing two birds with one and a quarter stones.<p><i>>5. Investigate Continuous Integration - ...makes automating your tests to run at checkin next to trivial.<p>Making checkin trivial is not a goal while coding. Getting something done IS. Anything that is not coding is not helping you make progress while coding.</i><p>It seems like you're just disagreeing to disagree on this one.  All the guy is saying is to consider having your tests run on a remote server every time you check in so that you don't break the build.  This is hardly radical advice.<p><i>>6. Know your code - It is one thing to write your code, but it is another greater thing to know your code. Four automated tools...<p>""Know your code"" & ""automated tools"" are mutually exclusive.

Automation takes you out of the very trenches you have to be in to get to know your code in the first place.

As a matter of fact, formalizing this process in a central location probably means you'll know your process better than the development lead who has an intern run deployment off a 12 step list scrawled on a Post-It note stuck to a monitor somewhere.<p>More importantly, if you're using deployment as a learning exercise, you're doing it wrong.",1221081105

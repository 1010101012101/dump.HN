Below I summarize the philosophy of this idea, my background and what I'm looking for in a technical co-founder.<p>The philosophy behind this idea is that ""incentives change the world, technology changes incentives"". Specifically, by building a market place for arbitration, we want to incentivize people to not use the government courts, lowering support for a democratic monopoly on justice along the way (but not explicitly). Think of it as building the 21th century equivalent of building the place where common law judges can hold their hearings and judge their cases.<p>My background is in strategy consulting but I consider myself an economist. I am well read in the relevant complexity theory and philosophy of law to the point where a philosophy of law professor told me my thinking on this topic is worthy of starting a phd. In short, I think I have the ""incentives"" part covered. I'm also learning Ruby on Rails and the related concepts (OO, MVC, TDD, CRUD, ...) so I can understand and help out the technical co-founder as much as possible.<p>The ideal technical co-founder loves to ""think in technology"", i.e. knows and can communicate all consequences and trade-offs in using certain technologies and methodologies. I'm currently leaning to building the site in Ruby on Rails and its related technologies, but ultimately this is to the technical co-founder to decide. Also, the co-founder should have an interest in libertarian thought, so the macro-economic consequences of what we'll be building are clear (and very motivating!) when I explain them (and we discuss them!). Last but not least, this person should not be under any contract that gives away the IP of the work (s)he does for judge.me.<p>If interested, please leave your contact details below so we can have a Skype video chat about this idea. When we decide to join forces, the goal should be to build a MVP as soon as possible, get feedback from the libertarian community and apply for YCombinator when we start to get traction.<p>If you know somebody who could be interested, please forward this post.<p>Hopefully this request will be the start of something beautiful. I honestly believe this idea can change the world and hope you do too.<p>Kind regards,\nPJ",1297100428

While the quarterly release process represented a definite improvement over the one release every 12-18 months we had been familiar with before, it still had some drawbacks.<p>The period of time required to put together a release was still sufficiently large that both engineering and management felt pressure to shoehorn stuff into releases. The cost of missing a release was waiting another quarter. For many engineers this means missing your quarterly objectives completely. The temptation to ship unpolished features was high, and the morale hit for missing a release was still tangible.<p>Moving to the interleaved cycle with 6-week updates is intended to break down these problems by making the consequences of missing a release less severe to both engineers and management. We are still in the early days of this approach and the team is getting used to the adjustment.<p>I'm pleased to see Firefox is going to be trying to improve the frequency of their releases.

As I said in my first post, giving reasonable wages to the lower/middle class means they have more disposable income and consume more.  I think this is a net positive economic effect.  If a high net-worth person makes 10x the average wage, that doesn't mean she will buy 10 times as many televisions, ipods, or cars.  She may purchase HIGHER QUALITY goods/services, but overall consumption from 10 workers making 40k per year and 1 high net worth person making 400k per year are not equivalent.  This consumer demand from the lower-middle class ultimately creates markets and creates long-term efficiencies.<p>>However, indefinitely preventing technology from advancing civilization is the exact opposite<p>I don't want to cling to the past.  But as our society progresses we must find ways to integrate hard working people that aren't the type to sit in a office all day.  I think Germany is a good model.  In high school, students are separated into a vocational track or an academic track.  Because of this, Germany has a very highly skilled manufacturing workforce today.<p>>I don't believe that there needs to be ""a viable option for 'hands-on' people to earn a livable wage<p>I disagree very strongly with this statement.  There are more 'hands-on' people than 'intellectual' people in this country.  If those 'hands-on' people can earn $25 per hour, then you can make your apps and devices and they will have enough money to buy it.",1297098385

2189651,comment,2189166,2189166,0,0,tptacek,,,"I really like most of Jason Cohen's posts, so this article is especially disappointing.<p>The most fundamental problem with Cohen's analysis is how he arrives at bill rates. ""Everybody knows"", he says, ""that your consultant isn't worth $100/hr --- you only pay him $30/hr!"". Well, no, Jason. Nobody knows that, because it's not true. Companies that engage consultants pay a significant premium to: (a) retain talent for the exact duration that they need them, (b) on often little-to-no notice, (c) with the flexibility of picking and choosing the right consultants for the right jobs (d) with no obligations on benefits and severance. And the consulting market is more liquid than the employment market (full-time jobs are ""sticky""), so prices more closely track value.<p>So it is the case that an hour of Rails/jQ consulting might bill out at $140, while the talent delivering that work might effectively make $40/hr. The talent is, in addition to base comp, also getting a stable job, experience working alongside iPhone developers sharp enough to start a successful consultancy, health, benefits, and all the other things that are the reason that big companies have to pay so much to staff projects.<p>This model works so well that there are branches of the industry that are difficult to staff outside of consulting. For instance, the very <i>very</i> high end of software security bills north of $400/hr. Even discounting for FTE benefits, nobody can afford that person full-time. This sets up a virtuous cycle whereby consultants amass expertise, drive scarcity in their field, and increase their comp.<p>It should also go without saying that when your bill rate is very high, you don't need to add consultants to make time for product development. You can work half-time and still beat a bigco salary.<p>The rest of Cohen's arguments are somewhat blunted by the fact that the underlying economics of consulting are <i>way</i> better than he thinks they are. To wit:<p>* The cost of fully loading headcount isn't scary when you're priced properly.<p>* Similarly, if you price with the market, the cost of ""scaling"" isn't scary. Offices are cheap compared to salaries.<p>* Most consulting firms deliberately aim to keep utilization below a threshold, and recruit to ""cool off"" when things get crazy. 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year isn't desireable even as an owner.<p>* Lots of consultants have written blog posts about firing dysfunctional bigco clients. Yeah, in the real world, you have to deal with the 25 page MSA contracts; that's what you pay lawyers for. Yes, being in business is annoying. If it wasn't, everyone would do it.<p>* Yes, it's hard to build and ship products in ""off hours"". But you don't have to do that. Instead, you can scale to the point where it's cost effective to hire full time developers. Most YC companies get to market with 2-3 team members. It isn't a stretch to scale a consultancy to the point where it can fund 2 developers.<p>Against all these concerns about consulting is the unbelievably huge upside of bootstrapping a company this way: you get near-unlimited lives. It is the JUSTIN BAILEY of startup plans. In virtually every other model of bringing a product to market, product failure ends the company. That's bad, because most products fail. They really, really do. There is no reason that a product miss should zero out all the hard work you put into building a team and a business.",1297098038

299145,comment,298844,298844,0,0,snprbob86,,,"This is why you should test for capabilities, not agent strings. I propose a new string called ""capabilities"" which is a delimited list of standardized test suite sections your browser passes.<p>Of course, your browser could lie about its capabilities, as many Direct3D drivers do. And you will still need to test in every single browser, as game developers need to hire labs to test on the 150 most popular 3D cards.<p>Although, a web browser IS web-connected :-)
We could have another new string which is ""I swear I am actually this browser and version."" and someone (<i>cough</i> Google? <i>cough</i>) could create a web service with a mapping of real browser agent string to real tested no-foolies caps.",1220939534

A great example or using our resources more effectively.<p>I asked about the feasibility of recycling plants because I can recall seeing piles of trash (plastics, paper, cans, food, etc) in Indonesia all over the place.  Even right next to some of the local shrines.  Locals may reuse/recycle some items but it looked like most of their trash when into these piles that were often burned at some point in time.  The thick black smoke billowing off of these smoldering trash heaps was disgusting and can't be great for the peopl e or the environment.",1220939257

Their site is created by another firm, but that firm's portfolio doesn't show any other cases of blocking IE7 that I could find. That would imply to me that that it wasn't thoughtlessness or arrogance on the part of the designer -- they were presumably asked to do that.<p>Granted the product is Mac only, but doing that to even the front page of your website is pretty ridiculous.<p>For what it's worth it renders poorly for me in opera because I've set Tools -> Preferences -> Web Pages -> Fit to Width on my machine, making 1024x768 browsing somewhat better by default.",1220938270

299131,comment,299061,299061,0,0,gleb,,,"I hate to be negative about a startup that way, but it's important to realize that ""direct-to-consumer genomics"" is a scam.  I went to a presentation by a founder of one the competitors (there are 3-4 high-flying competitors in the business), and I had the highest expectations.  But then throughout the presentation I couldn't quite figure out what the company actually does.  So I asked.  And the answer is marketing and litigation.<p>* these companies don't do any research<p>* they don't even own sequencing equipment<p>* all they do is send a sample of your spit to the lab, and send you a pretty writeup<p>* consider why is there no ""direct-to-consumer blood tests"" even though that information is far more actionable<p>I wouldn't even have a problem with this if it was a proper scam, like XanGo MLM, a nice nutritional supplement scheme, make-money-fast setup, etc.  With these you know upfront what you are getting into.  But these guys look so clean, and go out of their way to skate the narrow line next to the true medical advice.  Needless to say the legal budgets must be non-trivial.<p>I ran this by my cousin who is in nursing school.  And she goes ""Oh yuh, they are teaching us how to talk to people about all the nonsense results people [in increasing numbers] will get through these outfits.""<p>Some more reading: <a href=""http://microarray.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/deadline-today-for-personal-genomics-companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microarray.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/deadline-today-fo...</a>",1220938027

Shamus Young (<a href=""http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/</a>) generally has the view that PC gaming was killed by a) Excessive focus on graphics (which he has termed ""bling mapping""), and b) Overly byzantine DRM.

It's OK to ask if someone prefers the iPhone or a Blackberry.  But you can't just separate the keyboard feature and get a meaningful answer.",1214866715
232524,comment,231758,232063,0,0,DaniFong,,,"You're right that if you keep the implementations of Lisp compile time macros and use only that, you have as hard time reducing code that's already been macroexpanded, or applying global effects.<p>But when you might macros and the language itself, what you find is that you already have the pieces of what you need for a serious compiler: a symbol table, built in, a way to manipulate the parse tree, an easy way to do local expansions, and most importantly, a fully featured language.<p>You can do this with existing Lisps by a a few methods: making first class runtime macros, for example, or by saving the source code and working over it in passes.<p>Does this explain it?",1214866692

232513,comment,232482,232482,0,0,ericb,,,"Interesting to think of this in terms of 37 Signals feature-minimalism and ""say no"" philosophies.  Once added, this feature became a weight netflix had to carry through it's designs and keep working. Netflix chose to listen to the minority of customers and keep it--to not ""say no."" Would 37 signals have listened or just ""said no"", I wonder?<p>I think keeping the feature was a good move--the profiles feature previously stopped me from canceling my account under a  barrage of my wife's chick flicks that kept ""accidentally"" topping the queue. :-)",1214865100
232512,comment,232080,232474,0,0,gcv,,,"Early on, the author says: ""If you write an application with Rails, you probably have to write a whole bunch of new code, or at least change around all of your old code, in order to get it to run on multiple computers."" This is absolutely true. Rails ""scales"" by forcing programmers to do a whole lot of extra work (yes, sharding and secondary databases and lots of other things) which isn't particularly natural in the framework.<p>As a programmer, I'm not particularly thrilled to have to set up and maintain a memcached cluster and then write code to make sure my object reads pass through the caching layer. It's more work. It's more fragile. It probably forced me to revisit and modify working code.<p>The author wants to build a framework where scalable code is the default and natural way to write applications. Seems pretty well-thought out. He touches on many of the common pain points.",1214865055

There is no way that I would ever attempt anything but a greenfield application with RoR and to finish that I will probably need some help.  What attracted me to the language was the impression I got from reviewing descriptive materials from DHH and the 37 signals crew that Ruby has a great deal of elegance when it comes to interacting with databases.  And, for me anyways, that's the only kind of elegance I'm really interested in because I think that's where the money is going to be.  So far I'm not really good enough with the syntax to say whether it's going to live up to expectations but I haven't really seen anything yet that would cause me to say I've made a mistake in choosing this platform.",1214864814

232505,comment,232236,232477,0,0,jobeemar,,,"I don't think you really read the article since the author never said that parallelism is inefficient. He's saying, among other things, that decomposition (which you seem to favor) is not the right way to design parallel programs. In other words, if sequential objects are used to create sequential programs, it follows that parallel objects should be used to compose parallel programs. Sequential order thus becomes a consequence of signaling, i.e., communication between parallel objects.",1214864652

IBM ""Solutions for a small planet"" is one I don't even remember a little bit--and I've been serious about computing since the mid-80's.  So I think I have to disagree with them.  Apple's ""Think Different"" is pretty darned good, and ""Intel Inside"" was definitely a winner...and the right thing for them at a time when they were facing stiff competition from AMD, with very little to differentiate them (the CPUs were pin-compatible at the time, so one could drop an AMD CPU into any system and manufacturers could switch on a whim).<p>I'm having a hard time thinking of good tech taglines...Microsoft's ""Where do you want to go today?"" always seemed like a parody (with the obvious answer being, ""Somewhere far away from this infernal blue-screened machine""), but that's not the fault of the marketer who came up with the tagline.<p>Anybody have any favorites among recent companies, particularly software companies?",1214863347

232493,comment,232209,232448,0,0,bprater,,,"Elegance here means having much meaning a small space. Variable replacement is hardly programmable. More of a macro expansion.<p>To my eyes, this has lots of meaning:<p><pre><code>    div { color: var(CorporateLogoBGColor) }\n</code></pre>\nTo my eyes, this has very little meaning and forces me to  consult a reference doc every time I look at it:<p><pre><code>    div { color: #e852aa }\n</code></pre>\nI think the var() syntax is non-elegant, it's a bit fugly. I think Perl's $ might visually look more elegant.<p>Advantages: DRY works.

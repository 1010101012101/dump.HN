A lot of the hand-wringing regarding implementing new language features because it would cause a 'few percent' speed cost would be a lot more negligible.<p>2. if python 3k is going to be non-backwards compatible, then take the opportunity to put a lot more 'carrots' in there.  There a lot of good language features/design choices that can still be 'stolen' from other languages. Python could really use more flexible function declaration, ideally something flexible enough that you could simulate creating new keywords, then you don't have to worry about hardcoding new operators with hooks into object methods.<p>3. have the scientific community start switching to a different language/platform.  There are quite a few now that, IMO, are as nice or nicer than python, and have a lot more support behind them (V8?)",1331852055

I personally hate that crap and I'm doing what I can to not come off that way.<p>At the same time, I feel like I have to walk a delicate line between being open and forthcoming enough to attract potential partners and just opening my kimono and having a public discussion on the minutiae of my product, designs, market research, and business projections. Don't get me wrong, I certainly think the product concept is mature, viable, and worth building.

3711020,comment,3710843,3710843,5,0,tfb,,,"I've actually considered doing the same just to get out to SV for the benefit of my startup.  I'm in my early 20's with student loans to pay off, not a ton of free time (due to the startup) to freelance enough to pay for rent, and grew up in a pretty poor family as my parents screwed up and had my sister and I before my father was even out of high school.  So renting a place wouldn't be easy, and I would prefer to bootstrap as long as I can; I feel like I'd learn the most that way.<p>I was born and raised in NC, so moving out west would be pretty exciting regardless of my living situation.  For the past 20 months or so I've been bumming it under my dad's roof, and I feel like the stagnation has really slowed my startup's development to a crawl; so when I get back in good shape (man, I've really let myself go!), I'm going to jump at the first opportunity to get out on my own again, even if that means living out of my car.  I actually bought the car I have now because I expected to live out of it for a bit when I moved to SV.<p>Luckily(?), doing this actually won't be new to me.  Back when I toured with my old band, we practically lived out of our 15 passenger van - bunk beds and all - so I picked up a few tricks that help out when living on the road.<p>The only damper on the situation would be that I have a dog, originally my father's but I've ended up taking care of him.  Not sure what I'd do without the little guy by my side all this time.  ;)<p>Should I end up moving out west at some point, living out of my car or not, if anyone has any suggestions for good dog-friendly places for me to work out of (and network!)... I'd love to hear them!",1331851990

You pay for your own Mac, and they&#x27;ll give you  the corporate Windows image on your choice of a VM or on the hardware for you (not sure if it&#x27;s via Bootcamp or complete system wipe). Your cost center incurs a surcharge for Mac support, and you can&#x27;t take it to the local PC service center for most things.<p>The second is BYOD, and has 2 parts - phones/tablets, and laptops.<p>You can buy and bring any laptop you want, and we&#x27;ll install the IT image, put on full disk encryption, etc. There&#x27;s no subsidy for both BYOM and BYOD. You just get to chose what hardware you wanted to run with. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a requirement to buy $OURPRODUCTS, but the employee hardware discounts from Dell, Lenovo, etc only apply to them, so most people end up with our hardware. I think the largest increase in BYOD was after the Ultrabooks came out, but before they were available as a normal hardware refresh option.<p>You can bring your own phone or tablet. I don&#x27;t know anyone with their own tablet, but the phone is popular. Very few people actually have corporate cell phones, but you can get a discounts on plans and select phones. If you bring your own phone, you grant IT remote wipe privileges in order to get the calendar and email, and a couple dozen apps.<p>If you Google for the company + BYOD, you&#x27;ll find a lot of literature on the program; we&#x27;re actually pretty open about it.",1372161566
5938785,comment,5937296,5938255,1,0,smackfu,,,"Exactly. A few services have popped up that are $10 or $15 a year. Probably enough to pay for servicing your account but if the service isn&#x27;t popular, and there are only 100 users, that developer is not going to commit that much time or energy to the service and may just pull the plug after a year or earlier. As long as they refund your money, you can&#x27;t complain, right?",1372161562

I mean it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve always known, but never considered until recently.  Until just a couple of hundred years ago, this was not the case - you could do something which put you at odds with your country, and despite their best efforts, you could still disappear.  Contrast that with today, when your freedom hinges on the whims of our parent state and the subsequent whims of any other state which might decide to stick their neck out to help you.  It&#x27;s unsettling how much different the two situations are in terms of how much control the state ultimately has over us.  And that control is only increasing.<p>Do something against the collective state apparatus, and you had better hope that somewhere, someone is willing to help you out, because without those documents, you&#x27;re going to be fucked.

Adding remote members to an on-site team that works like an on-site team seems unworkable in my opinion. You can have remote developers that get assigned work like a contractor, but IMHO a remote developer can never truly be part of a team that functions like an on-site team.<p>Now, a truly distributed team is a beautiful thing and can in my experience outperform an on-site functioning team. I&#x27;ve worked on highly performing distributed teams that only saw each other in person once or twice a year. When a distributed team has a conference call, everyone generally calls in individually from their own phone/skype, even if some are in the same room. A distributed team working in an office uses the office more as a private co-working space.<p>The key tool in every distributed team I&#x27;ve ever worked on is chat, usually IRC. The great thing about chat is that it&#x27;s asymmetric communication, but targeted and instant unlike email. In a distributed team, I can throw out a question on irc without worrying about interrupting anyone or throwing someone out of the zone by tapping them on the shoulder. A lot of non blocking discussion happens throughout the day that prevents having official meetings.<p>If a company genuinely wants to move from functioning as an on-site team to functioning as a distributed team, I&#x27;d suggest everyone on site rotate taking a week and working remotely, especially management! It can&#x27;t feel like you are doing extra work for the remote members, but that you are changing your team to work in a distributed manner for the benefit of everyone.",1372161170

I&#x27;ve lost confidence in US tech companies, because they could be forced to act without being allowed to disclose it or reasonably fight it.<p>To date I still don&#x27;t believe what Google/Amazon are saying.

Apple contributes to FreeBSD and it gave us clang. Hardly an example of a company that embraces closed source.<p>SPARC was interesting from a technical standpoint, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been an asset to Apple.

5938747,comment,5937899,5937899,19,0,tikhonj,,,"I think this is a perfect example of one of the main ideas behind lazy functional programming: we can reify computations as simple data structures.<p>This thread system? It&#x27;s just a large lazy tree. This lets us implement all the logic in a straight-forward way, just by operating on the data type; since the language is lazy, everything ends up being evaluated at the right time.<p>To me, this was one of the bigger revelations with Haskell. Stop thinking about lists as <i>lists</i>, and consider them more like loops. Just loops that you can pattern match against and manipulate in a truly first-class way. Then extend this to computations of any other &quot;shape&quot; by thinking about other lazy structures.<p>Free monads are in some ways the ultimate example of this in action: you can use do-notation--which clearly <i>looks</i> like a computation--to just produce a data structure. Then you&#x27;re free to consume it however you like. Monads usually represent computations, perhaps with effects, but here we have an extremely general one that is just an algebraic data type!<p>This works because we can decouple defining the data structure from evaluating it. We can build up our tree with a sequence of calls to fork and so on, in the order of our program flow. Then we can actually evaluate it in the order of our scheduler! This is one of the core ideas behind laziness.",1372160974

Some random quotes:<p>&quot;The result is rather typical of modern technology, an overall dullness of appearance so depressing that it must be overlaid with a veneer of &quot;style&quot; to make it acceptable. And that, to anyone who is sensitive to romantic Quality, just makes it all the worse. Now it&#x27;s not just depressingly dull, it&#x27;s also phony. Put the two together and you get a pretty accurate basic description of modern American technology: stylized cars and stylized outboard motors and stylized typewriters and stylized clothes. Stylized refrigerators filled with stylized food in stylized kitchens in stylized homes. Plastic stylized toys for stylized children, who at Christmas and birthdays are in style with their stylish parents. You have to be awfully stylish yourself not to get sick of it once in a while. It&#x27;s the style that gets you; technological ugliness syruped over with romantic phoniness in an effort to produce beauty and profit by people who, though stylish, don&#x27;t know where to start because no one has ever told them there&#x27;s such a thing as Quality in this world and it&#x27;s real, not style. Quality isn&#x27;t something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree. Real Quality must be the source of the subjects and objects, the cone from which the tree must start.&quot;<p>We have artists with no scientific knowledge and scientists with no artistic knowledge and both with no spiritual sense of gravity at all, and the result is not just bad, it is ghastly.<p>This condemnation of technology is ingratitude, that&#x27;s what it is.

You haven&#x27;t solved anything.<p>The way to solve the conflict between human values and technological needs is not to run away from technology. Thats impossible. The way to resolve the conflict is to break down the barrier of dualistic thought that prevent a real understanding of what technology is  not an exploitation of nature, but a fusion of nature and the human spirit into a new kind of creation that transcends both. When this transcendence occurs in such events as the first airplane flight across the ocean or the first footsteps on the moon, a kind of public recognition of the transcendent nature of technology occurs. But this transcendence should also occur at the individual level, on a personal basis, in one&#x27;s own life, in a less dramatic way.",1372159058

It&#x27;s a view that&#x27;s slowly dying down with newer generations I feel like, but there does seem to be this sort of fear around technology devoiding them of &#x27;humanity&#x27;, and thus their creativity, which is the most treasured thing you can possibly have as an artist. I&#x27;ve seen similar resistance towards learning music theory and writing things down[1] within some musician circles as well, which tangentially stems from this. Makes artists seem paradoxically conservative in a way, but I think the logic makes sense even if I don&#x27;t agree with it.<p>[1] Jazz is a good example of this; usually they only have bare-bones lead sheets (musical skeletons/outlines of sorts) to go off of, due to the genre&#x27;s unique improvisational nature. And in a different realm of music, Lil&#x27; Wayne never wrote down any of his lyrics during the prolific stages of his career either. So there something to be said about such things possibly helping creativity; and if something as simple as writing stuff down could be interpreted as &#x27;hindering&#x27; creativity, then complex technology usage can surely be interpreted that way too. Sometimes the best way to squeeze out creativity is to impose some restraints on yourself, so it&#x27;s not all that surprising.",1372158897

There are dependencies to stopping the service - maybe telling the load-balancers or your monitoring system.  When the service has been upgraded, you can trigger notifications that other items within your config can depend upon (for example, when an upgrade is complete, restart the service, when the service restarts, add it back to the monitoring system etc).<p>All of these can be modelled in these config-management tools, as <i>explicit</i> dependencies within your manifest file - as opposed to <i>implicit</i> and ad-hoc dependencies within your script.",1372158079

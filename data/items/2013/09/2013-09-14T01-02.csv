I could cut out all the carbs I&#x27;m eating and still be eating well over 3000 calories a day (in fact, I do that right now, personally). Eating fat-soaked deep fried junk is the bad one. Carbs are no the enemy. Calories are.<p>I also never say to a beginner &quot;eat less calories&quot; because people trying to lose weight have a very, VERY big emotional attachment and reaction to the word calories. That&#x27;s why weight watchers hides that with their points system. They just say you can eat x points today, we don&#x27;t care how you do it, go nuts. (The formula is points = calories/50). Eat a whole loaf of white bread or a massive pile of pasta today for all they care. As long as you stay under your points allocation, it doesn&#x27;t matter, you will lose weight.<p>In the long, long run, you can tweak that.",1379123973

Such as jay-walking, it is also illegal.<p>However, do people still jay-walk? Of course they do, because it provides convenience, a sense of accomplishment -> dopamine. So is it similar to drug use? Of course. The difference is that jaywalking laws are enforced way less than hard core drug uses.<p>Now laws aren&#x27;t always black and white, judgment is often involved. Outside of law, mentally should we be more accepting and acknowledge drug use instead simply putting it down? Sure why not.

Look at people who are fighting to keep it on!! Read up on people who have to do significant amounts of work under limited caloric availability (not caloric restriction per se). At that level, 6 smaller meals keeps weight on (more efficient digestion). Eating fat leads to more weight loss (heat entropy). At a certain stage, how you do the work (cardio/crossfit) etc is irrelevant, because the order of magnitude of output=input. For a normal person at a gym, they are at a fraction of this workload. Walking an 4m/hour a day burns 400 calories a day. That&#x27;s an order of magnitude off your metabolic rate of 2500/day. Walk or run 10 hours a day, you will burn 4000-8000 calories a day. You will deplete glycogen at hour 3-4 without a couple of those six meals. If you do this for 60 days on a 2500 calorie diet, even if its 40% fat, you will lose weight. Probably pushing yourself into unhealthy territory afer only a fraction of that time (if you have a standard BMI). That&#x27;s a non-cardio, non-intensive workout BTW. That stuff is irrelevant, provided your metabolism is set to max by dynamic caloric consumption requirements at the same order of magnitude as base metabolic reuquirements. Cycling 40 miles a day (as the author claimed) is much closer to this threshold than other examples.",1379122372

A lot of the copy on the site is only currently in draft form. and there are plenty of inconsistencies with the code base itself. Hell, there isn&#x27;t even a download link.<p>I&#x27;ve been privately been working on the framework trying to get it to a place where i&#x27;m happy enough to open it up for outside feedback and it&#x27;s not quite there yet.<p>The idea behind semantic UI is that html tags aren&#x27;t truly semantic, but have become conventional to programmers. There is nothing semantic about using an &#x27;a&#x27; tag to refer to a link or td for a table cell. These codifications make web development less accessible to non programmers. Ideally we&#x27;d all start going around creating our own top level tags to define user interface, but we don&#x27;t really have that opportunity today.<p>The only chance, I believe, we have to build a linguistically semantic web is to build conventions around class names usage, the bit of web design where most FEDs make their decisions.<p>Semantic uses DIVs as an equalizing factor. If we can&#x27;t control how browsers interpret tags then we might as well ignore them. I&#x27;m sure a lot of this stuff sounds terribly bombastic. The intention is quite the opposite.

As primarily a maker of hardware, it made no sense that Motorola would cut out the <i>possibility</i> that Microsoft (or others) would come up with something compelling, but that&#x27;s what they did.<p>Samsung, HTC and others were poised to be there if Windows Phone succeeded. It didn&#x27;t and likely won&#x27;t, but they didn&#x27;t cut themselves out.<p>Just to respond to the other chap who responded to you -- I have never, ever bought the &quot;just another Android maker&quot; argument. It doesn&#x27;t make sense, and has never been the case in the market. Each vendor tries to get your purchase through their own compelling merits, and the platform really does become a commodity, but in a <i>good</i> way for them. That is why Nokia and their hardware/imaging focus could likely have done gangbusters with Android.",1379121173

6384187,comment,6382490,6383055,1,0,e12e,,,"I think this is fascinating -- but I&#x27;m not quite sold yet.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about frameworks along these lines; use js (or something that compiles to js) for the logic, allowing shared code-bases on server and client. One major motivation would be to seamlessly render on server for clients that doesn&#x27;t support javascript (be they lynx/w3m or some crawler etc). Another would of course be to try and keep things reusable.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure html+css+&quot;interactive/event-handling&quot;-js is a good &quot;compile target&quot;, though. I&#x27;d much rather see something as close to the output as reasonable -- because there are so many corner-cases with html and css. This is one of the reasons why I like the idea of zope&#x27;s TAL/METAL templating[M] so much. My interest in TAL is also why I don&#x27;t think this (general architecture) is going to quite work.<p>With TAL, you can basically make a mockup that <i>is</i> a template, complete with sample data. But then you need to break up that template to have widgets. And widgets need to be inserted across different areas of the document (think a calendar, where you mouse over events to change an info box. That can be structured, but it is going to cut across a lot of you entire page/app. Even if you don&#x27;t load content asynchronously). This is done in Plone/Zope using METAL (Macro Expansion for Template Attribute Language).<p>In fact, the Plone project has essentially given up the idea of using TAL+METAL to theme a site -- it is now (ME)TAL->html+css+js -> page/app &quot;base&quot;. Then that base is modified/rewrtitten using diazo[D] (xml transform but with easy support for using css selectors rather than forcing full xpath syntax on a poor dev) - that basically can include new css and js -- but fundamentally can rewrite the entire html-document, splicing in content in sections.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that <i>that</i> is the best way forward either -- but I think that is one of the best ways of writing rich html &quot;documents&quot; -- or systems that revolve around pages. For &quot;pure&quot; apps, I think maybe a full on js approach like ELM[E] is better -- the code is cleaner -- you don&#x27;t really care about the html, css or even javascript as such -- you focus on the functionality.<p>As for Ojs, I looked a bit at the examples:<p><pre><code>  http://ojjs.org/download.html#examples
</code></pre>
and one thing struck me -- is there really a reason for the js client and server examples to be different? Couldn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t the server side tools be able to deal with the code for client side -- so that you can write once, and then deliver server side or client side from the (exact) same code base?<p>Despite all this, I think it is an interesting project.<p>[M] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language</a>

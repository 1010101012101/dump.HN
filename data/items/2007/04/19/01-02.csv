To me it just feels overly formal and extraneous for the level and type of conversation I expect to find here.  It's a lot like shaking my roomates hand in greeting every day.<p>To answer your question: \nProgrammers Notepad, WinSCP, TurtleSVN, PuTTY<p>\n",1176947702

14401,comment,14090,14129,0,0,rjam,,,"That's completely true. I also like the blogosphere more than normal news because bloggers are more credible. Anyway, I'm also happy good bloggers can monetize their work by doing payed reviews and I'll continue to be happy as long as they keep the responsibility to write honest reviews, that can disagree with the product/service/business reviewed.<p>Besides that, you will be always able to find honest bloggers who will write this reviews in a responsible way, why? because there a lot more bloggers than news channels ;)",1176946523

It's the users who decide who wins in the marketplace, not the companies.<p>""... Google is proactively squashing any chance that the little guy who is extremely innovative once had. Google is no longer a creative, positive force on the Internet, but a massive corporation who makes up in muscle what they lack in creativity. Start-ups beware!""<p>Again. Google can't squash a competitor, only the users can. If StumbleUpon is better than Google's Dice thing then it will die the same death as Google Base and Google Page Creator.",1176946122

But how many times have you heard a corporation fighting for an acquisition with another corporation and then announce a similar function hours after losing the acquisition battle?  <p>Point is the thing google has implemented isn't even close to StumbleUpon. But due to the timing it is getting labeled as that so it makes even more sense that Google might be trying to make a statement here rather than a stumbleupon killer. Of course it could be doing both but it has already done the former.",1176945086

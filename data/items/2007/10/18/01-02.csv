69424,comment,69403,69403,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I see a trend: ""Who will market for us?""<p>The missing answer to this is the thing you're doing wrong.<p>You!  In a startup, you do everything.  If you aren't willing and able (or willing to become able through self-education or taking classes), then you shouldn't be in a startup...or you need to partner with a person who is capable of and willing to do the things you can't or won't do.<p>It's that simple.  You have to build a team that answers every need in a business--and those needs are many.  Some things can be removed from your plate with money, if you have some money.  Some things can be put off until you have money.  But some things, like getting customers, are absolutely vital.  If you can't make something and get it into the hands of people that want it, you haven't done your job.<p>Also, you seem to like picking business ideas where you have no history and where having a history could make you far more successful in a shorter time.  I once knew some folks who started a company that did water table surveys for city and state governments and they built an interesting business with two guys and a few contractors and no money up front.  How did they get into something like that?  Interestingly, they came in sideways...they had been in the oil and gas industry as drilling site managers (e.g. a non-technical management field), and many of the same geophysicists they had worked with in that industry worked in the water table business, as well.  They had the in they needed to bump them into a multi-million dollar business without needing years to build a reputation (they had spent the years building a reputation working on oil platforms and in deserts and other crappy places).<p>If you want to be in windmills, you ought to work in the alternative energy industry...it'll teach you what those customers want, how it is currently delivered, and give you some ideas for making it better.<p>The thing about most companies that YC deals with, is that they are picking a problem that's new enough to have no established players, and requires very little money to start.  That's a model that anyone in your shoes ought to consider, regardless of YC involvement.<p>Windmills aint it.  CMS aint it (though some niche markets in that area might be).  Lyrics to hindi songs...if you need VC funding for that, you're not thinking about the problem in the right way...that's just not a VC kind of business.<p>Another problem I'm seeing is: You need an idea that you can commit to.  Find something you really believe in, and do it (or join the team that is doing it).  It sounds like Try 8 is still-born already.  When you start using phrases like ""waste more time on"", then you can be pretty sure you have an idea you don't believe in.  If you don't believe in it, how the hell do you think you're going to convince customers and investors to believe in it?",1192670777

69422,story,,,9,12,jkush,"Your startup idea. Why?",,"I've recently discovered the value of having a recursive (and very honest) conversation with myself. I ask ""why?"" to big statements and assumptions. I find that eventually I end up somewhere interesting. Is there a psychoanalytical term for this? <p>Here's an example of a real conversation I had with my daughter a few hours ago:<p>My 2 year old daughter asked why my SCUBA gear was in the guest room shower. I explained that it was there because my gear needed to dry out. She thought for a moment, then asked: ""Why? Why is your gear wet?""<p>I explained that my gear was wet because I had gone SCUBA diving. After thinking a little bit more, she asked, ""Why? Why did you go SCUBA diving?""<p>I explained to her that I was taking SCUBA diving lessons. She then wanted to know why I'm taking SCUBA diving lessons of course. So I explained that I was taking lessons so I could learn how to SCUBA dive. She let the matter drop then, but I kept thinking about it.<p>So why do I want to learn how to SCUBA dive? <p>I want to learn how to SCUBA dive because it's something that I've always wanted to do. <p>Why? Because I think what's underneath the water is fascinating and SCUBA diving seems like a good way to explore.<p>Why? Well, I can't hold my breath for very long so if I know how to SCUBA dive I can stay down longer and learn more about what's under the water. <p>Why? Because there's something so cool about floating under the water and exploring the environment. <p>Why? Because it's the closest I'm ever going to get to space travel.<p>Asking ""why?"" recursively helped me nail what it was about SCUBA diving that has interested me for so long. Strange as it may seem, I've been subconciously associating SCUBA diving with something like space exploration. Floating around? Check. Alien environment? Check. Dangerous? Check.<p>Being an astronaut, space travel, all of that stuff was the kind of thing that had me daydreaming for hours as a kid. I would have never guessed that my desire to SCUBA dive had anything to do with space travel. \n <p>So what's your big idea? Why?<p>\n ",1192670601

I'll use a baseball metaphor to describe it. I hope you'll understand the reference. The point was that it's not hitting the home runs that matter, it's getting the times at bat. That is, if you're always swinging, and you're always learning, it's just a matter of getting enough pitches.<p>\nYou want to fail fast and learn from it. What I've found that sucks is that to qualify an idea, generate the site, and really get humming might take 4-8 weeks. This means you can't just try out ideas by joining a group for a couple of weeks. Ideas need to be beaten, nurtured, and planned. So if I had any criticism, I'd say ""go out there and build something that works, then ask what did you do wrong"". Because failing is fine, as long as you keep failing forward.",1192669503

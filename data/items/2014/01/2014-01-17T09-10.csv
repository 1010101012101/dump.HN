7075040,comment,7073853,7074161,10,0,masklinn,,,"There is a perverse logic to it: using a gun is considered lethal force, using a gun as warning is using lethal force in a situation where you don&#x27;t need it (since you shot a warning) and self-defence protections thus don&#x27;t kick in.<p>As a result, you should shoot to kill, not to warn, whatever the situation is. It&#x27;s completely bonkers and it ignores that warning shots are a separate and higher-impact deterrent than many other options (especially for &quot;lightweight&quot; such as most women), but that&#x27;s the general case law. IIRC there was some hubbub in FL about &quot;fixing&quot; this (aka making warning shots non-felonious in a self-defence situation) but I don&#x27;t know if that passed. And that&#x27;s just for FL anyway.",1389952682

It&#x27;s akin to wanting your Librarians to be good at Calculus and Library maintenance.<p>Research and teaching are separate skills, one doesn&#x27;t imply the other. Research requires great amount of intelligence and imagination and dedication, while teaching is best suited for those that have great speaking abilities, great charism and slightly lower intelligence (it&#x27;s easier for people of same IQ to relate). Asking to researcher to teach will detract from researching and vice versa.<p>One solution is to have cooldown period of research to focus on teaching. But I think R&D should be kept separate from teaching, but in the same way teaching shouldn&#x27;t be bogged down by standardization.",1389952654

The songs constantly sound better on Spotify than on Rdio (that&#x27;s at least my impression).<p>Ah and for me Spotify is actually cheaper than Rdio (I have Spotify premium for offline mobile support).

7075035,comment,7073853,7074161,2,0,smsm42,,,"In general, firing into the ground is very rarely a good idea. In most places, the only permissible reason to use lethal weapon is when you feel you are threatened by force that is very likely to cause you grave harm. If you are feeling thus threatened, why would you shoot <i>the ground</i>? You should be shooting whoever is threatening you! If you didn&#x27;t, the police would assume you did not genuinely feel threatened but instead wanted to show off or intimidate or make a statement and such. And in most places, using a lethal weapon such as firearm for any of these is a crime (unless, of course, you are a policeman, police plays by completely different rules and regular law does not apply to them).",1389952622

At the time there was an old unmaintained ColdFusion app for student group registration.  Having recently been dabbling in PHP for the unions websites, I proposed writing a new student group registration site from scratch in PHP.  My manager approved, I gathered requirements from the stakeholders in the office for student activities and 3 months later shiny new mysql-backed PHP registration system.<p>They also did cool things like let me open source the custom CMS I wrote and push forward with a standards based HTML template while the rest of the University was still on a standardized but antiquated table-based template.<p>I realize now that I&#x27;ve been incredibly lucky with the people I&#x27;ve had above me in every single organization I&#x27;ve worked for in the last 15 years.",1389952061

I had to take a few months off after moving to the city, and I felt pent up and frustrated without a physical outlet.<p>2) Music: A short term mood improver is to put on some high energy music, preferably stuff you can dance and move to. Music gets the brain juices flowing.<p>3) Sunshine/vitamin D: Being a night owl, it goods to resync to a daytime schedule every quarter. Getting to walk in the sun for a few minutes and observe daily bustle is refreshing.<p>4) Most importantly, working on challenging and interesting projects: My last few apps were largely clones of previous successes. This means I didn&#x27;t have to think up anything new, or creative. I was unmotivated to work on it because it was mostly &quot;manual labor&quot;, with no new programming riddles to solve.

Some diabetics never feel low blood sugars; the longer you have diabetes the more common it is to experience this phenomena.  Additionally how you &quot;feel&quot; a low blood sugar varies over your lifetime so the &quot;tells&quot; change.  This means we may be feeling different, but have no idea that it is because of a low blood sugar since we haven&#x27;t felt this new warning symptom before.<p>When I first was diagnosed with diabetes I could tell quite early if my blood sugar was low. If my blood sugar dipped to just 70 I would start shaking like a leaf.  Now I don&#x27;t have any warning signs at least until I hit around 55 and sometimes not until the low 30s; when I have symptoms at all. I have twice had incidents where I fell because my blood sugar had dipped so low with no physical warning signs.  Both times my vision went black for a second and I fell over.  I don&#x27;t know if this was me actually &quot;passing out&quot;, but in both instances I recovered almost immediately and immediately consumed large quantities of juice to get my bgl back to normal as quick as possible.<p>When I do have a tell it is difficult to even notice now; the best way I can even describe it is that I have a very sudden sense of dread as a feel my mind sort of shifting away from me. By this point I&#x27;m so low as to be in serious danger zone. I try like crazy to stay out as far away from that as possible by testing as frequently as possible, but your fingers can only take so much; and even if they could take some more the insurance carriers won&#x27;t cover more test strips anyway.<p>I think this Google product is a great idea and I would love to see something like this actually work, but like the parent of this thread; I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.

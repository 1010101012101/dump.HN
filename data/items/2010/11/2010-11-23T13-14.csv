You can't benchmark the conversion rates of ecommerce sites in completely different industries: the customers and their behavior is just too different. The list has a grocery store, a plus-size women's clothing shop, pet medication, and even office supplies. You just can't compare the conversion rates of such diverse customers directly.<p>A more accurate benchmark is within industry: take a website and compare its conversion rate to its competitors'. <i>That</i> is interesting, and even then comes with a big caveat in that you need to be careful with the market segment.

Thinking about my time here and what I've observed, let me share what I've found a Firefox user in China is probably like.<p>Firefox users have much in common with GMail users.  They're often involved in IT related industries, or at least higher technology industries.  They choose Firefox as they value a higher quality browser, like they choose GMail for a more trusted email solution with a greater feature set.  They often speak English at work.  They don't run Linux, that's far more niche.  They're probably post-25 - not that Firefox/GMail is an older thing, but it is a self-discovered/word-of-mouth thing.  They're technology influencers and are probably interesting in owning an iPhone for the feature set rather than the fashion statement.  Many would probably also be interested in Android opposed to the bulk of China which may not have not heard of it (yet - wait for the Baidu edition).  They're white-collar professionals.  They might wear dockers and shirts to work, maybe a jersey in colder weather, maybe jeans.  They probably don't primarily consume English/Western media but they might not be wholesale consumers of mainstream Chinese media; a critical eye would be thrown on some discussions, especially post-Sichuan earthquake and revelations, and Sanlu and other food crises.  They might not use QQ (a popular MSN/ICQ like IM program), which really is saying something in China.  They might have once used Twitter, but don't seek to 'jump the wall'.<p>In short, they're savvy, sophisticated consumers.  But as mentioned in the article, the 'Internet experience' in China is quite different from the West, and convergence shouldn't be assumed.  I look forward to the next post.",1290520308

The instructor <i>may</i> choose to defend the choice to the student, but the instructor should only be <i>required</i> to defend the choice to the student if the student is also required to be able to defend why they should be allowed to be there.  I fear the most precious thing we've lost in our modern society is a student's willingness to bring themselves to the process, and so if I (as an instructor) must defend why I've set boundaries on an exercise then then you (as the student) must be able to defend that you really want to learn what I have to teach.<p>Alas, higher education has been reduced to a transaction for a service, and ""the customer is always right"".<p><i>few situations warrant such limitations, and I agree with him about that.</i><p>I have the opposite view.

Most likely, in the massive rush to replace everything, cronies and political allies will carve off chunks, loopholes etc. to profit from.<p>The USA is different in that its institutions grew up over a few hundred years, starting out with a fairly trivial population and minimal government over a primarily agricultural people, and growing the state in response to crises. It's certainly important that it had a very good core in the constitution and the early amendments (bill of rights etc.); but that just laid down the architecture of what grew like a crystal afterwords.<p>Unfortunately, there's a brand of anacho-libertarianism in certain influential chunks of American thought, especially in economic circles, which believes that government itself is evil, and that if you only overthrow it, everything will be better. They tried that with shock therapy in Russia, and to a degree even tried it again in Iraq - no planning for aftermath etc.<p>It's my opinion that almost every part of a well-functioning state is balanced between strain in multiple directions, getting larger and getting smaller, regulating more and regulating less, clamping down on moral offenses and easing back on others, etc. These kinds of strains oscillate with the political winds, and the organizations that are grown in prevailing winds are stunted in one direction or another, and only corrected when they've gone too far, in a crisis.<p>In the light of this metaphor, it should be clear that an overthrow isn't the right recipe to grow a good new state: the organization won't have had the time and crises to grow in balance with its competing stresses. Instead, the immediate insiders will be unstoppable political gales, deep structural faults will be embedded into the heart of the operation that guarantee the politically favoured factions rents for decades to come.<p>I speak of an Irishman, who has, of late, longed for a revolution in my homeland, but recognizes it for the folly it would be. My country's primary problem is that it has too many representatives, too much clientelism, too much of politics is cynically local, and above all too much voting is based on tribal allegiances that date back to civil war nearly 100 years ago.",1290518699

That it makes all the sense there but that i think that a real grassroots ""technology experimentation mecca"" should better develop it's own culture and views about life and machines and stuff --- one better than this American-culture offshoot that i am guessing Silicon Valley is.<p>So technology is cool, hacking is cool, how does this affect our lives? It seems to me a bit too US-high-school thing that to prove you're cool you have to become a millionaire. Haven't you wondered why the cool guys like Woz depart and the pinpricks like Jobs stay? Too much macho display, i say. We are like Peacoks, instead using our brains as display?<p>For example, there is this TED talk about this one guy who leaves some internet-linked comps in the middle of nothing in India and then just comes back 6 months later to see what the children did with that, this guy is certainly not making as many millions, but i believe he is nurturing a certain ""relationship with technology"", and this, to me, is the one thing that is valuable about Silicon Valley.<p>By ""socially contextual mode of analysis"" i was trying to express something like ""could the old lady living on a shack on the middle of nowhere share your dream of a Philippino Silicon Valley?"" Is it possible to share this vision? Not that Old Ladies should code, obviously, but could you make a girl secretary that is likelly to become this old lady in 50 years, could you make her proud to be working for a high-tech fling? Proud enough to stick with you after being offered a better pay?<p>Could you have girl coders? And could they do it because they like it and not because it is ""a right thing to do""? Because, you know, coding is fun.<p>I am deeply convinced that money is almost never the solution. And that when there is no ""solution"" to speak of, the simple injection of money will create pain. So what i am saying is that there must be a culture before there is a market, or something like it. That the idea must not be written in dollars, but in expectations and dreams, in enthusiasm, and, finally, in the good-old curious spirited hacking.<p>That said, have you seen ""leadership lessons from dancing guy""?

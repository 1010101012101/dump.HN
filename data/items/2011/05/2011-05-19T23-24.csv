2565837,comment,2565458,2565793,12,0,asomiv,,,"What the hell, why is my post downvoted? I wrote a very informative post. If someone disagrees with me then come clean and give me a rational reason, not just clicking on the downvote button!<p>But to answer your question: no, it's not inetd. Inetd is very inefficient in terms of CPU and memory usage and has scalability issues thanks to the fact that it spawns a new process for every client. Systemd does not do that: it waits until someone connects to the socket, then starts the service and have the service handle all clients on the socket. Systemd then waits until the service has exited. The service can use I/O events or threads or whatever efficient mechanism to handle multiple clients on the server socket, all within a single process.<p>This in itself does not require Linux-specific features. However the GNOME discussion is about depending on systemd which happens to be Linux-specific at the time for other reasons, not about GNOME wanting to be Linux-only (which is sensationalist headline). One of the reasons systemd is Linux-only is because it uses cgroups, which I explained here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2565801"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2565801</a>",1305849598

(snark snark snark) :-)<p>Hah.  well, you are the one talking about effort being more important than intelligence.   I, on the other hand, have always been lazy.   I was in the program through ability alone.[1]<p>I mean, clearly effort matters.  But ability matters, too.  Otherwise I'd be working at the 7-11 like my parents said I would if I didn't go to college.[2]   Of course, if you can't do anything about innate ability and you can do something about effort, ""praise effort not ability"" makes sense, as you should try to improve the thing that can be improved, right?<p>On the other hand, I think effort has limitations, too.   As a kid, I was pulled out of the ""gifted"" class one hour a day to work in the ""special ed"" room.  Handwriting.   My stepmother made me spend probably five hours a week practicing my handwriting at home on top of that.   To this day I can't write a legible sentence.<p>I think key is to put effort in to areas where that effort makes a difference.   Consume all the low hanging fruit before you start scaling a sequoia looking for pine nuts.<p>[1] the ability to do well on standardized tests, that is.  I've never had to learn to work a cash register, so it's gotta correlate to something useful, but I'm first to say that I'm really not all that bright.<p>[2] Actually, considering my schedule variance, I wonder if I could hold down a job where the primary performance metric was ""did the guy show up on time?""",1305849528

There was a voodoo trick which involved running the kindle on windows (which I do not have) and snarfing the book from within memory while it is decrypted... It reportedly worked, but I could not check because I do not have Windows.<p>For myself I found an approach which I might finish sometime: Kindle on wine, a small X application that takes a screenshot of the Kindle window, OCRs it via tesseract, and then sends the emulated ""right"" keypress. The OCR quality was pretty good, of course I'd lose the formatting, but then no need to worry about Next DRM Format.<p>Just to clarify: all of the above is for purely being able to search/copy, etc. from the contents.

Look around you, do you know of any big company that came along, offered something with such seemingly good intentions that their offering made the competition look like crooks? I'm sure we could come up with a few examples. Off the top of my head:<p>- I'm reminded of the days when hotmail would delete my emails without my consent, because I was going beyond the 2mb they were giving me. While they were trying to get me to pay for 200mb, gmail appeared out of nowhere with a red cape and saved me with a free 1Gig that quickly turned into 2Gigs. How could I not look at Google like a superhero and at Microsoft like the villain?<p>- Similarly, while I visited France a few years ago, I saw that they had this system called the Freebox (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_(ISP)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_(ISP)</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebox</a>), that literally revolutionized telecom in a country otherwise very conservative when it comes to technology. Free's offering was so compelling that it created a real disturbance that dramatically affected market pricing (tv, telephone, internet).

Traditional POSIX APIs like killpg() do not allow that and give processes the ability to escape supervision.<p>You say FreeBSD's kernel APIs are superior. It makes me wonder why you think that.

2565780,comment,2565458,2565588,36,0,asomiv,,,"Systemd is inspired by Apple's launchd (which has an unfortunate license) and has a few really nice features:<p>- Many traditional init systems are based on a bunch of shell scripts with some metadata. Each service is started through a shell script that supports the start/stop/restart argument. While this makes the implementation very simple, it also makes it inefficient. To start a service the init system must create a new process (the shell script) which in turn invokes a bunch more processes (because almost anything you do in a shell script requires external commands) before finally invoking the service itself. This is expensive in terms of both CPU usage and disk I/O, and the latter really matters for boot time. Systemd accepts a bunch of service description files and handles the starting and stopping for you.<p>- Traditional init systems are about starting and stopping services. Systemd is also about keeping services running. For example if a daemon crashes, with most init systems you have to restart it manually or hook it to some external monitoring system. External monitoring systems usually rely on polling to check whether services are still alive. Systemd on the other hand just forks() the service, waitpids() on it, and gets notified by the kernel when the services crashes. No polling involved. Polling wastes CPU and reduces battery life. Polling also makes leaves a small time gap during which the service is temporarily dead but hasn't been restarted yet. This latter can be mitigated with a smaller polling interval but the smaller this interval the more CPU you use.<p>- Systemd supports on-demand starting of services. It starts a service as soon as a program needs it. This works by having systemd allocating server sockets and listening on them. When a client connects to a server socket, systemd will not accept() the client; instead systemd will figure out which service it belongs to, then starts that service, passing it the server socket. The service then accept()s the client. This is great for saving CPU, memory and disk I/O until it's really necessary. It saves battery life and reduces boot time. EDIT: It's not (x)inetd, see my reply.<p>Unfortunately most people slam GNOME and systemd for being NIH or crazy without understanding the reasons. I hope this post makes some people understand the rationale behind systemd.",1305848347

Its not a snarky comment I'm genuinely curious.<p>If you are programming, find you enjoy it, and wish to continue doing it for money, continuing education should be right up there on your list of things to do. (whether you have a Ph.D in CS or just a high school diploma, new stuff is coming out all the time).<p>There are a lot of free resources now online. You can get the syllabus and curriculum for classses that are taught in places like Stanford or MIT or UC Berkeley. So even if you spend the next two years of nights and weekends 'filling in the gaps' in your knowledge you will find that not only do you get better at your 'day job' but you will start aceing those 'fundamental' questions.<p>There was a time when to do this you would have to audit a class at a nearby university which imposed limits based on schedules, location, etc. But those times are behind us now. Take an old desktop machine from the e-waste dumpster behind some company, load up FreeBSD or Linux on it, and start doing the home work from some of these courses. The fundamentals are fundamentals because they apply universally, and you don't need a fancy rig to compare the performances of various sorts, or explore bloom filters, or key exchange algorithms. You can run MySQL on crappy hardware for the size databases you need to run to learn SQL.<p>Granted the assumption is that you can currently access the internet and you live somewhere that is currently consuming IT hardware (pretty much most of Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand. and the N. American continent).<p>If you are a 'Senior in college' and your major was CS and you flop the fundamental questions then there is a bigger problem here.",1305846351

I have tons of key shortcuts set up in Gnome, I call all my programs from the keyboard, etc, so it's not that hard. Plus, it will save you a lot of time.",1210658216

It was a little strange to watch him mouse around a webpage with the Wacom pen, but he claims it helped him tremendously.<p>Otherwise, learning the keyboard shortcuts for your favorite programs might go a long way to help you reduce strain.<p>Also, I haven't personally used it, but I like the concept of this mouse, it slides into your laptop's PCI slot (probably not too good for the wrists, though):

So, while I agree with the article in that the results aren't there yet, the only way they're going to get any traction is if they're simultaneously making the product better and screaming very loudly that they're awesome.<p>So, while they may have under-delivered, I don't think they've over-promised, because I still haven't heard any message, and still don't care much. I'd be more than happy to give'em another 30 seconds in 6 months to see if it's better than ""key words wikipedia"".",1210656728

188324,comment,187855,188088,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I find it really sad that marketing is so pervasively backwards that marketing that's useful to the user can be considered an <i>interesting</i> concept... it should be the norm!<p>If a product or service is so great and amazing, it seems to me that simply describing it, without the usual bullshit hype and borderline (or outright) lies that usually accompany the description, should be enough for people to try it, love it, then tell everyone they know how great it is.<p>As an example of what I'd call ""<i>real</i> marketing"", for my upcoming niche fansite about some MMORPG, I want to give maximum information to potential users about what my site does and how, before they even sign up. And I'm working hard to structure the site properly and have usable navigation, and eventually I want tutorials integrated all throughout the site and such. In fact, I'll let users try a limited version of the site just by providing a username and password, no email required. The idea is to make barrier to adoption almost impossibly low.<p>And I do want to produce marketing material, though I'll let my users distribute it. First, the marketing stuff will be segregated in one section of the site, so that people can go look it up only if they actually want to, I don't want to use the braindead ""opt-out"" approach that seems so popular where you spread your bullshit hype everywhere and your customers have to ignore it if they happen not to want to hear it (which most of them don't). I'll produce a couple versions of my marketing material, targeted to specific kinds of users. So if for example some alliance member wants to convince his leader to adopt my service for the whole alliance, he'll show him the leader-targetted page. So, make a great product that people WANT to talk about and then make it EASY to do so, provide a lot of ""meat"" so they have lots to talk about. I'm lucky because my site is so focused on a tight audience that I just need to tell a few people directly about it to bootstrap adoption.",1210655499

The most ""useful"" thing you could do would be to seek depth, not breadth: Keep working on your mediocre Spanish until it becomes fluent Spanish. There's an absolute ton of Spanish speakers in the USA, to say nothing of the rest of the hemisphere.<p>(By extension, another useful thing you could do is just continue practicing ever-more-advanced English. :) But that presumably fails the ""fun"" test big time...)<p>From there, if you've ruled out Chinese (native speakers everywhere!) and Japanese (inspiring manga and anime everywhere!) as too hard (which is probably wise), I think you're down to:<p>- French (folks on the web rave about <i>French in Action</i>; lots of speakers around the world; great movies and literature; and the <i>food</i>...)<p>- a language spoken by some nearby foreign friends who will be pleased to practice with you occasionally (in my case: Chinese, Polish, Hebrew)<p>- a language spoken in a country you really want to spend time visiting (hint: <i>Italian</i>)<p>- Latin. Intellectually interesting. Relatively easy to study without a teacher: Your accent will almost certainly suck, but none of the native speakers will ever care, because they're all dead!

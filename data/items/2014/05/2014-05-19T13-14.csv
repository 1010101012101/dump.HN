After watching her on stage at Techcrunch, and seeing how vague she is with the actual implementation, it&#x27;s pretty clear to anyone paying attention that she simply painted a printer and pretended to print a makeup pod. My girlfriend even remarked how it looked exactly like a Bare Escentuals pod off the shelf. She basically got all this attention with an idea and no actual implementation.<p>To me, this would be the same as someone going up on stage and saying they&#x27;ve created a food printer, stuck a Subway sandwich in there and pretended to &quot;print&quot; it. If I were to do that, I&#x27;d be laughed off the stage instead of getting so much press and acclaim.<p>Her ability to convince the world was perhaps because this idea seems simple enough that we just might believe it (although I have to think printing a dye on a substrate you can apply to your face is a VERY hard problem.)<p>Not that I give much weight to Techcrunch as it is, but it saddens me to see so many other companies that worked so hard and actually built real things get overshadowed by an HBS MBA who built a weekend hack reminiscent of many high school science fairs efforts.<p>I really really hope she proves me wrong.",1400507969

It used to be that the GPLv2 allowed use of libraries in applications so long as any adjustments to the library contributed back to the project.

[2] So, attempting to dictate what license I use when writing <i>my code</i> by including a &quot;viral&quot; copy-left clause in your license is tyrannical and arrogant.<p>I do have to eat. So if my only choices are GPL licensed libraries and a project we can&#x27;t release source for, all you GPL-only guys make me waste my time writing a proprietary library.<p>I absolutely resent the copy-left.

7767364,comment,7766006,7767061,2,0,jerf,,,"I&#x27;ve never proved this formally, but one of the big problems with the Erlang syntax is that it has comma, semicolon, and period as distinct separators, despite the fact that as far as I can tell, they are <i>never</i> ambiguous in the grammar. I&#x27;ve never been able to construct a series of tokens in which the meaning changes based on which of those you use, and it&#x27;s legal either way. If you can, please, by all means show me (no sarcasm, I really would be intrigued to see it), but I bet it won&#x27;t be commonly found in the wild either.<p>Beyond that, most of my annoyances are not technically syntax, but I gotta tell you that the above really is a big problem for newbies, and the annoyance never goes away even after you know what you&#x27;re doing since it always inhibits moving code around.<p>But as Elixir shows, the annoyances really are mostly with Erlang-the-<i>language</i>, not the implementation. Personally I sort of hope the success of Elixir helps the Erlang team take a fresh look at the Erlang language... there are some fixups one could do to Erlang to make it less annoying, too, and I think it could be all done compatibly. (A syntax to import functions from a module... a &quot;match & rebind&quot; operator... unifying the , . ; operators... something to clean up record manipulation... honestly, it wouldn&#x27;t take much to really polish up Erlang and make a lot of the recurring klunkiness go away, that list alone would have cleaned up huge swathes of my code.

If the depth of your free domain is the issue then perhaps the solution lies with the domain registrant taking the cost of a wildcard certificate (~$30/yr with startssl, ~$60/yr elsewhere) and so their subscribers can use it for SSL. They would have to proxy web requests to you though (with something like nginx in a reverse proxy configuration), so it would not be a zero admin option and would cost them in extra bandwidth requirements too unless they already host your content (rather than just responding to DNS requests for content hosted elsewhere), otherwise the only way you could use the cert is for you to know the private key which breaks the assurance model completely.

I have had to skip holidays and neglect my family and I have still often had my work trivialized. My work is not appreciated, the fact that I have given up almost everything else in my life is not appreciated. Most people do not even make it to their 5th year in our group.<p>I spent a lot of time being really bitter about all this. But I have realized that <i>you have to do this to be a good scientist.</i> My adviser only wants to train good scientists. So I&#x27;m not even upset about it any more. I have to look beyond my adviser, and look at the actual science I am doing, and realize that he is irrelevant, but that I still have to behave in this way (i.e. giving up much else in my life) to make progress.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll encounter this in neurosci. Perhaps good neurosci research can be done without this level of commitment. I&#x27;m sure it would depend on your exact specialty. But I&#x27;m telling you all this so that you don&#x27;t end up being really bitter towards your adviser if you get into a situation like many aspiring scientists face. It&#x27;s not his fault.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what your problem was with the quotes you posted. I guess it was that he was calling his students weak? My point is: in school, what your adviser says is fundamentally irrelevant. Don&#x27;t let it affect your self-esteem. But science itself has a way of absolutely kicking your butt. And that is <i>why</i> professors say things like that in the first place.<p>It takes massive virtue to be a good scientist. It also takes a particular set of life circumstances in order for it to be a rational choice. What <i>I</i> do would not have been a rational choice if I had considered it mandatory (for me) to have a girlfriend or start a family, for example (at this stage in life).<p>That said, I haven&#x27;t left because what I do truly is rewarding. I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;d rather be doing. I am a purely selfish person. I don&#x27;t do science for the greater good. So my point here is: it can be worth it.",1400506178

If language packages are to be distributed on each system using the system package manager, then the way to get a new package into the hands of programmers is to a) write the package and b) before anyone has used it, spend a couple of years convincing a person on each system to create and maintain a system package for this <i>new and completely unused</i> Ruby/Python/Perl package.

My background is in I guess what you&#x27;d call systems programming in C and C++. I haven&#x27;t found the Erlang syntax to be a problem at all, but I&#x27;ve had major problems with a few things-<p>* The ambiguity of the term &quot;application&quot;. It has a very specific meaning in the Erlang context but it used very generically elsewhere- it can be very confusing even just reading the docs.<p>* My background is in GNU Make/autoconf etc. and after a lifetime of building a binary, putting a binary onto a Unix machine, and then running the binary, figuring out how this works in the Erlang context was enormously confusing, and although the docs are very useful once you understand the build and deploy process, I think that some diagrams like those in this post would go a long way toward making it clear to a newbie what the division of labor between the local erlang install, systools, reltool (and possibly rebar since it seems to be nearly ubiquitous), and then once the release is built, what the boot script does, etc. Even little details like, why do I have a file called whatever_sup.erl and another called whatever_app.erl, and why are there a bunch of different functions named stop or start or init? I don&#x27;t mean to slag on Erlang, as I like it a lot, but I found this part of the learning experience to be painful.<p>* Everybody talks about the hot code loading as if it just happens automatically, but as evidenced by the existence of Relx, it&#x27;s not always trivial to work with, and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing you can mess things up for yourself pretty easily.<p>I am not a huge fan of jumping on third-party bandwagons for tools like rebar or relx- I like to try to stay as close to the OEM tools (for lack of a better term) as much as I can, so it&#x27;d be nice to see some of these tools become a part of the canonical OTP distro.<p>BTW the &quot;Learn You Some Erlang...&quot; book, has maybe the clearest and most gentle introduction to the building/releasing stuff that I&#x27;ve seen, but I think it could benefit from some more detailed diagrams.",1400504698

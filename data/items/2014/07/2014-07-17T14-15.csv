8047887,comment,8046860,8047739,14,0,omgtehblackbloc,,,"<i>Being a cop is legitimately dangerous</i><p>Not really, no.  It&#x27;s just not that dangerous.  We imagine it must be dangerous, and so do cops themselves.  But you&#x27;re a lot more likely to be killed as a garbage collector or airline pilot, or a construction worker, or plenty of other jobs.<p>It&#x27;s like with the &quot;war on terror&quot;.  The fear of danger is much more powerful than the danger itself.  And like with terrorism, the fear is actively promoted for political reasons.<p><i>They do what everyone does, what has to be done for policing to be viable.</i><p>That seems like an argument against the department as a whole, not a justification for an individual&#x27;s abuse.<p><i>Most of the people they deal with are lowlifes, lyres, cheaters.</i><p>Most of the people they deal with are ordinary innocent civilians whom they assume are &quot;lowlifes&quot; because they have been trained and conditioned to.<p><i>That said, this following cops around only plays to the problem paradigm. It&#x27;s harassment, like what paparazzi do. It&#x27;s belligerent. Maybe it&#x27;s valuable as a protest, but it isn&#x27;t as solution.</i><p>It is belligerent, and it is harassment, and it is protest.  And that&#x27;s the point.  People with power do not voluntarily stop abusing it.  They continue until met with resistance - until they are forced to stop.<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s effectively suicide to physically force the cops to stop, but we should do everything we can short of that to stand up against them.  Standing up against the cops sets an example for others that we don&#x27;t need to fear them, that they don&#x27;t deserve respect and deference, and that we can do something directly to stop their abuse.",1405609149

One of their moderators posted my product but used a very unfitting title. I tweeted and wrote to them but didn&#x27;t receive a response until the next day and, if you&#x27;re familiar with PH, that is simply too late because my product was already buried in the previous days posts...and then I was told they couldn&#x27;t do anything more to help me.

8047876,comment,8047679,8047824,2,0,Slackwise,,,"I actually just read RMS&#x27;s post on his history with Lisp [1], and I find this is the closest you&#x27;re going to get as an answer:<p>> At first, I thought of making a Lisp-based system, but I realized that wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea technically. To have something like the Lisp machine system, you needed special purpose microcode. That&#x27;s what made it possible to run programs as fast as other computers would run their programs and still get the benefit of typechecking. Without that, you would be reduced to something like the Lisp compilers for other machines. The programs would be faster, but unstable. Now that&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re running one program on a timesharing system — if one program crashes, that&#x27;s not a disaster, that&#x27;s something your program occasionally does. But that didn&#x27;t make it good for writing the operating system in, so I rejected the idea of making a system like the Lisp machine.<p>Which I guess can be interpreted as:<p>1. Lisp is ideal when the underlying technology/hardware helps it, and at the time, a Lisp-on-common-hardware implementation wasn&#x27;t going to match that ideal/performance profile.<p>2. Lisp machines didn&#x27;t have &quot;time-sharing&quot; (i.e. multi-user environments).<p>Nowadays, 1 isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, and 2 could have been done as well, just wasn&#x27;t a thing at the time.<p>Personally, I would love to see a modern Lisp Machine.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html</a>",1405609099

And so naturally we blog (at <a href=""http://blog.planitwide.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.planitwide.com</a>) on 2 topics:<p>a) Travel, which falls into a couple of categories:<p>i) Deep dives & reviews of quality travel resources and why someone should choose to use them in a specific (or sometimes broad) context<p>It&#x27;s not hard to choose topic - we start with what we know & use - and that&#x27;s a long list.<p>ii) Thought leadership on the travel space in general (which ties into why we exist in the first place).<p>These are the kinds of posts that (we believe) will eventually get us noticed and establish our credibility as people who know whtat they&#x27;re talking about.<p>b) Startup Life\nLike every startup, there is a boatload of learning that happens. These are all perspectives that can benefit other people in the same boat.<p>Again, not hard to come up with topics, just see what you&#x27;ve learned trying to do xyz. Even (and especially) failure is valuable learning to share.<p>><p>2. Promoting content:<p>We promote on<p>a) Social Media: Twitter & Instagram (no bandwidth for more). Instagram is especially useful for showing behind the scenes stuff & sneek peaks at what&#x27;s coming (which can then also be shared on Twitter - or other platforms) simultaneously.<p>b) Travel focused communities: /r/travel on Reddit & Outbounding.org. Being on here also involved mostly participating in discussions and building reputation. Our content promotion is an afterthought. People will discover it if they find it useful<p>c) Startup/tech focused communities: Hacker News, Inbound.org, Growthhackers.com, USVconversation.com. Again, same principle as other communities - don&#x27;t talk about yourself most/all of the time. Build reputation first.<p>d) Medium: We cross post to collections we&#x27;ve created on Medium for additional exposure to the audience that comes there to read great content.<p>><p>3. Does blogging work?<p>Two things:<p>a) Rule of thumb is that if you&#x27;re starting out, you&#x27;re going to be blogging for near-zero audience for nearly 6 months. We&#x27;ve been at for 3-4 months and while we have some traffic, there&#x27;s no real engagement (as expected) with our content yet in terms of shares/comments etc.<p>It all takes time and you have to stick with it.<p>b) Blogging doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you have to have a wordpress blog. It can mean you do it on Medium, or Tumblr or even as a video blog solely on youtube. It all depends on what your end goals are.<p>Hope that helps.",1405608800

8047751,comment,8043655,8045457,1,0,Dewie,,,"> Given that C++ is in fact used pretty much everywhere, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by that.<p>1. It isn&#x27;t a given, from what I&#x27;ve read, that their product would need a language that could be realistically used <i>everywhere</i>. A lot of applications can get away with technology that is more &quot;limited&quot; in that sense. And being &quot;limited&quot; can be a plus.<p>2. Even if a language is used everywhere doesn&#x27;t mean that it is/was an appropriate choice in all those cases. Look at people implementing stuff in Python, then reimplementing it in some static language later, giving a performance boost and less bugs, and almost/just as productive (though having the experience of doing it for the second time probably helps). Turns out that they didn&#x27;t really need the dynamicity of Python after all. In C++&#x27;s case, maybe someone started developing an app and found out that they didn&#x27;t really need the performance that a no-cost abstraction language is able to give, and so wouldn&#x27;t need to pay the cost of dealing with the complexity of C++.<p>> And I think Rust is applicable because it hits all of the big features the author is touting as good in OCaml, such as first-class functions, immutable values, strong static type checking and type inference, ADTs and pattern matching.<p>And you also have the added features of smart pointers, managing pointers, heap/stack allocation, explicit use of views vs allocated memory (string allocated on heap vs string slice, for example), etc. These are all features, or burdens, depending on your application area. But why would they be features, in this context?<p>> It also has benefits that OCaml doesn&#x27;t, such as full memory safety,<p>Doesn&#x27;t OCaml have full memory safety?<p>> no required garbage collector,<p>Why is a garbage collector problematic, in this context?<p>> , and good C FFI (I&#x27;m no OCaml programmer but glancing at the beginning of the Real World OCaml&#x27;s chapter on FFI, it appears OCaml uses dlsym() to look up functions at runtime, whereas Rust can outright link to them like any C program would). I&#x27;m sure there are others too, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with OCaml to list them. I&#x27;m also not sure what the performance of OCaml is like (a glance at the Computer Language Benchmarks Game suggests it&#x27;s often slower than C++), but Rust aims to have C++-equivalent performance.<p>It boils down to fine-grained control over performance, I guess. But, again, I don&#x27;t see how that is a plus in this context. It can also be a burden, hence all the languages that deliberately do <i>not</i> let you have explicit control over memory - it makes for less stuff in the language, hence less complex language overall, or perhaps more room for other stuff that might be relevant to the application of the language.<p>I don&#x27;t get the apparent attitude of &quot;it has all the features of OCaml, <i>plus all this other stuff</i>&quot;. More <i>stuff</i> is not necessarily good, and can be a burden if you don&#x27;t really need it.",1405607758

A gun isn&#x27;t an off switch. People can confront an armed cop and shooting doesn&#x27;t always stop them.<p>There are also all sorts of rules that are learned on the job and aren&#x27;t not in any manual. Ways for maintaining control and authority mostly. Many of these practices are unsanctioned and unofficial, but still essential for being able to do the job. Some things are both crucial and illegal.<p>Cops usually feel like when they get busted for being arrogant, bullying or outright violence that they are are victims of these situations. They do what everyone does, what has to be done for policing to be viable. Those pencil pushers with their removed perspective are making judgments about their irrelevant rules being broken.<p>They are under stress. Violence is a part of their days. Most of the people they deal with are lowlifes, lyres, cheaters. There is real stress. Real danger<p>That said, a lot of these practices aren&#x27;t benign and they aren&#x27;t inevitable. The police does genuinely attract many problematic people and it makes other. They get used to defending their authority and meet challenges to it with extreme responses. They develop a cops & robbers, us & them worldview that becomes their reality. More specifically cops, criminals and naive spectators, citizens & bureaucrats.<p>They develop a bullying mannerism.<p>Police manage to do their jobs without guns at all in many places. They deal with violent crime just like cops in the states. I&#x27;m not saying this should be adopted by US department, but is proof that there are other ways of doing things.<p>I think lights good for the paradigm. But, whatever that light reveals needs to be dealt with. Maybe police modus operandi needs to changed. But, maybe the rulebook needs to change too. It can be dangerous trying to enforce the official rulebook after long periods where it has only been enforced selectively. Maybe the official way of doing things doesn&#x27;t work.<p>That said, this following cops around only plays to the problem paradigm. It&#x27;s harassment, like what paparazzi do. It&#x27;s belligerent. Maybe it&#x27;s valuable as a protest, but it isn&#x27;t as solution.<p>What I think should happen in law enforcement is that everything should be recorded. Every interrogation. Every arrest. Every time a cop pulls you over.  This is all evidence and it should be part of every booking.<p>Hopefully that will make the need for this sort of thing go away.",1405607660

On July 22, during our public earnings call, I’ll share further specifics on where we are focusing our innovation investments. The first step to building the right organization is to make changes to our workforce. With this in mind, we will begin to reduce the size of our overall workforce by up to 18,000 jobs in the next year. Of that total, Nokia Devices and Services is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs, comprising both professional and factory workers. We are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions, and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months.</i><p><i>It’s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas. My promise to you is that we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible. We will offer severance to all employees impacted by these changes, as well as job transition help in many locations, and everyone can expect to be treated with the respect they deserve for their contributions to this company.</i><p><i>Later today your Senior Leadership Team member will share more on what to expect in your organization. Our workforce reductions are mainly driven by two outcomes: work simplification as well as Nokia Devices and Services integration.</i><p><i>First, we will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability and move faster. We plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making. This includes flattening organizations and increasing the span of control of people managers. Our business processes and support models will be more lean and efficient with greater trust between teams. These changes will affect both the Microsoft workforce and our vendor staff.</i><p><i>Second, we are working to integrate the Nokia Devices and Services teams into Microsoft, completing the acquisition announced last September. To win in the higher price tiers with our first-party phone portfolio, we will focus on design and technical innovation. In addition, we plan to shift select Nokia X product designs to become Lumia products running Windows.

8047608,comment,8042618,8044576,2,0,graycat,,,"There is some very good thinking in this thread, and maybe there are some really good answers to your questions.  For a fast answer:<p>For algebra, that&#x27;s easy:  I&#x27;ll show you how that works right away.  Basically you are doing the same arithmetic you&#x27;ve already done for years but are doing it with letters instead of specific numbers, that is, with &#x27;variables&#x27;.  Here&#x27;s how a &#x27;variable&#x27; works:  There is a number.  Call it x. Now, let&#x27;s see what we can say about x.  Suppose we are told that<p>2x + 3 = 9<p>Now the equality will remain if we subtract 3 from both sides, so let&#x27;s do that and get<p>2x = 6<p>Now the equality will remain if we divide both sides by 2.  So, let&#x27;s do that and get<p>x = 3<p>Or we could have been told that<p>ax + b = c<p>Then, similarly<p>x = (c - b)/a<p>That&#x27;s the main idea in first year high school algebra.<p>For literature, you already know a lot about it and like it a lot.  Why?  Mostly &#x27;literature&#x27;, say, from Chaucer and Shakespeare to Dickens to the present is &#x27;storytelling&#x27;; nearly all of movies and most of TV is storytelling; and you have no trouble understanding and liking a lot of movies and TV shows, right?  For Shakespeare, if you can&#x27;t read the original (tough to do if only because it&#x27;s in Old English that would get a grade of F today due to bad grammar), just read the appropriate Cliff Notes or some such that just clearly explains, no doubt from experts, just what the heck is supposed to be going on in Shakespeare.  Maybe the guy who wrote Cliff Notes was the last guy who actually read the original Shakespeare?  Maybe not, but Cliff Notes are a much easier start than the original.  Cliff Notes are easy, and it would be tough to get that much out of the original on your own.  Using Cliff Notes is not cheating and, instead, is just making good use of a library or bookstore -- standard smart work.<p>&#x27;Literature&#x27; is mostly a case of &#x27;art&#x27;, and that is mostly\n&#x27;the communication or interpretation of human experience or emotion&#x27;.  So, it&#x27;s about humans and especially their &#x27;experiences&#x27; and their emotions, heavily from their &#x27;experiences&#x27;.  Does literature actually tell you a lot about people?  Well, sometimes there are still no better substitutes, but now commonly can get much more solid information from, broadly, &#x27;clinical psychology&#x27;.<p>&#x27;Storytelling&#x27; can be regarded as an &#x27;ancient Greek mind trick&#x27; because it was the ancient Greeks who, apparently first, discovered that the main techniques of &#x27;storytelling&#x27;, which maybe now we can call &#x27;formula fiction&#x27;, are a sure fire way to get and hold the attention of an audience.  So, sure, TV dramas use those techniques to keep people watching long enough to see the ads.<p>Why Shakespeare?  Because, while maybe you will like it, lots of other people do like it, and for the rest of your life you will be expected to know some of the main points and quotes from Shakespeare or be regarded as &#x27;uneducated&#x27;.<p>Anything actually useful in Shakespeare?  Mostly we have better sources now, but sort of:  There&#x27;s a lot in Shakespeare about how humans feel about various parts of life; so can learn something about humans.  Can see a lot of bad or dumb behavior from humans, disloyalty, deception, manipulation, self-deception, etc.; again, generally we have better sources now, but, say, Lady Macbeth was one nasty woman.  For a good, short introduction to Lady Macbeth, sure, just use the Internet and, sure again, Wikipedia, say,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth</a><p>If you like movies, then with some help from Cliff Notes and the Internet, you can like some Shakespeare.  Really, Shakespeare is some of what they had instead of movies long before movies.  You enjoy movies; enjoy some Shakespeare.<p>Literature, mostly just storytelling, is simpler than one might guess.  So, usually there is a &#x27;protagonist&#x27;; that is the main character in the story.  Commonly the story starts out introducing this character in a way that makes him seem real and likable.  Then, BOOM, somehow suddenly the protagonist gets a problem of some kind.  Now as a reader we get concerned about this character and what happens next, that is, we &#x27;identify&#x27; with the character (ancient Greek mind trick).  We don&#x27;t want to walk out after the first one third of the movie, right?  So, the story has &#x27;captured our interest&#x27;.  Or the story has a &#x27;hook&#x27; to capture the reader&#x27;s interest.<p>Then we get to see how the protagonist handles the problem.  At the end the protagonist is usually successful solving the problem.  In cowboy movies, the protagonist, say, the Lone Ranger, gets the bad guys.  In a lot of movies, e.g., &#x27;Back to School&#x27;, he gets the girl.  So, usually at the end the protagonist is successful solving his problem and the reader or audience is left happy because the audience &#x27;identified&#x27; with the protagonist.<p>For a lot on how to write such stories, see, from an expert, say,<p><pre><code>     http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-king-on-how-to-write-2014-7\n</code></pre>\nSo, that&#x27;s algebra and literature.

8047602,comment,8046461,8046641,4,0,sophacles,,,"I like this point. I think one of the problems is productivity can be measured so many ways, and they seem to be so context sensitive.  Just looking at my own life suggests multiple types of measures for productivity...<p>For instance. I can apply the author&#x27;s method to my house cleaning. Just wait until it&#x27;s been scheduled, and knock it out fully in a manic cleaning session every other month for a few hours. Afterwards my house will be dazzling, and it will be great for a few days. Then I can do nothing for a while and it will turn into a mess over time again, and a couple months later I can make it dazzling again.<p>Unfortunately my goal is not to sometimes have a sparkling house - its to have a clean house because I find it peaceful. Bursty productivity is at odds with this goal. Rather, the overall result of spending 5-10 minutes a day cleaning stuff, with the occasional deep clean meets this goal better. Therefore it&#x27;s more productive - the average state of the house is much much cleaner.<p>However, I recently built a patio at the same house. I had started it 3 years ago with the goal of &quot;work on it a bit every weekend til it&#x27;s done&quot;. After a couple weeks, it didn&#x27;t progress anymore. So I set aside the weekend earl this summer and knocked it all the way out. Done, complete, usable and the goal is met.  Basically the author&#x27;s method. Bam goal met, in 1/150th of the time I spend trying the other way. Unbelievable productivity!<p>Of course I can come up with code analogies from my work too - but these are simpler but still illustrative examples :)<p>So it seems there is at least one axis of consideration for productivity - the maintenance vs one-shot axis.<p>Another thing that comes to mind related to this: personal development. I find that sometimes it feels like I&#x27;m not progressing at all - this is my skill set, this is what I&#x27;m capable of, thats all. Then one day I find that bam - I&#x27;m writing a bit of code that I know would have struck me as impossible a few months prior. Example: I remember about a year ago, I tried to grasp the dragon book. I gave up because it was too over my head on a lot of topics. I set it aside as as something to grapple with later. The other day I had to write a parser to handle an input file format that had the underpinnings of a DSL. I went and found a parsing library, and wrote a working parser using decent technique. In the interim I didn&#x27;t really even explore that stuff - mostly I was focusing on unrelated goals. But somewhere in there I &quot;leveled up&quot;.<p>In fact &quot;leveling up&quot; is a productivity related analogy I like a lot - it seems sometimes that I&#x27;m just grinding out things, and not making any progress, but in the background my brain is doing things - tiny imperceptible things, and then one day suddenly something clicks and they whole of the changes is noticable - I leveled up. Just like in an RPG when you grind out some battles do some boring side quests, and generally don&#x27;t notice major differences. Then you get the level and have a new power and it&#x27;s exciting again. This is productive, but in a different way: the end result is being able to accomplish more, but there&#x27;s not a really good way of discussing it, the language isn&#x27;t there.<p>Another under-explored topic is that of a concept I call many-tasking. It isn&#x27;t multi tasking. It isn&#x27;t single-tasking. It&#x27;s more related to priortization and task ordering. Find a task that is blocking a few other tasks, and get it done, freeing up lots of other things to do. Similarly (much related but not exactly like David Allens context notion) there are often many very similar tasks related to bigger projects. Grouping them can be much more productive than not doing so. For example this morning I&#x27;ll sequentially work on: some tasks for ops - making our services easier to deploy, some tasks for testing that will take advantage of some of those ops improvements, and a few changes to our core algorithm that will make it stabler. They all are related to the same handful of modules, so I group them together rather than put them as the independent tasks they are. There is still some context switching, but it is light-weight as I&#x27;ll already have loaded the code into my head. I&#x27;ll accept the overhead of context switching rather than the much bigger overhead of reloading that code 3 times this week. So that&#x27;s a nuance axis I guess too: it isn&#x27;t multi tasking or single tasking - there&#x27;s a continuum there that has various tradeoffs.<p>Finally though, there&#x27;s the very real issue that different people are different. Different ideas of what matters, different ideas of how to get into flow state, different ideas of how to group things, etc. It adds a layer of complexity to these discussions, because it seems a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that the small differences between people can lead to big differences in style of work - they assume they have a lock on the right way.",1405606392

It&#x27;s a fallacious argument, but it makes it easy for a lot of people to dismiss those in need.<p>Actually on second though... I&#x27;ve seen that attitude from plenty of people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> well off. It&#x27;s quite pervasive. I guess people just want to believe that it&#x27;s always possible to succeed through hard work, and that they/others aren&#x27;t just getting fucked over.",1405606053

I&#x27;ve known several MBAs personally and only one was legitimately intelligent -- the rest were sales guys who thought their MBA entitled them to make big decisions with perilously little background or knowledge of much of anything related to the situation.<p>I know an MBA right now who is pursuing a business wherein he offers wifi hotspots to small businesses. His literature claims that renting one of his hotspots will make the business &quot;PCI compliant&quot;. I&#x27;ve personally advised him on multiple occasions (gently at first, growing more stern over time) that this claim is patently ridiculous and only displays his incompetence to anyone knowledgeable in IT, but he refuses to amend his materials or statements. Just the tip of the iceberg with him.<p>Granted these are anecdotes, but I think they embody the anti-MBA ethos. Qualified persons strongly dislike MBAs because MBAs often feel their MBA grants them immunity from doing things incorrectly, and that they are instantly authorities on everything without requiring any experience or research.<p>I swear they have to explicitly teach that in business school, like: &quot;Now, this degree grants you the magic power of never needing advice, information, or training, and you will always be right, and normal people won&#x27;t understand that because they didn&#x27;t go to business school... but remember, business school is the only school that matters.

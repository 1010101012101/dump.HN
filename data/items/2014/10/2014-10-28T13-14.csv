The KISS rule applies big-time here.  The more complex the software, the more likely it is a significant flaw will be found and exploited.  It remains unclear to me whether there should even be a microcontroller on a USB TRNG.  Without one, we can eliminate the complexity from the USB key itself, but we have to move the whitening and health monitoring to the driver.  It is unclear to me if making the driver more complex opens it up to enough additional attacks that the system is less secure overall.",1414504709

One night, trying to finish a project, I drank an entire quart of strongly brewed coffee (~500mg)and ate the caffeinated breath mints like popcorn (30mg each)[0].

I was hearing whispers on the other side of closed doors and watching a fly buzz past me in what seemed like slow motion. I could feel the carpet texture through the soles of my shoes and time seemed to slow down.<p>At the time I thought it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life and vowed to repeat it sometime.<p>Thinking back I realize I was probably experiencing mild hallucinations and could have been on the verge of collapse.<p>edit: Added caffeine estimates.<p>[0]Can&#x27;t believe I found this. <a href=""http://www.wegotcoffee.com/mints/zingo.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wegotcoffee.com/mints/zingo.php</a>",1414504642

Across most industries, technology and tracking are used to make businesses run more efficiently and provide better services. That&#x27;s great and definitely adds value.<p>However, law enforcement seems to think that now that companies are collecting all this data, they should have access to it, too, without restriction. The problem is that once these sorts of programs become common knowledge, the companies start being viewed as just an arm of law enforcement. Do you trust the local police? FBI? NSA?<p>No? Then don&#x27;t trust these companies.<p>The solution to this is not to stop the mail tracking (tracking numbers are an awesome feature), but to curtail the reach and powers of the executive. Law enforcement shouldn&#x27;t be able to request whatever they want from these company datasets.<p>So how do you fix it?<p>First, the business records laws on which these data requests rely are incredibly antiquated and not meant for huge networks of communications. So a solution is to update these laws to better protect user tracking data when it is in the hands of a company. However, Congress doesn&#x27;t seem to want to do anything, so the legislative branch is losing power more and more.<p>Second, the judicial branch could step in and rule that these searches are protected under the Fourth Amendment. However, the executive has been claiming privileged on most of these cases, which means they get dragged on for years and years. Kudos to the EFF and ACLU for sticking it out, but the judicial branch is simply not keeping up with executive power grabs.<p>Third, users of the companies can start fuzzing or encrypting their data. In this article, a solution could be for someone to offer an aggregated address to which people can send letters. It&#x27;s basically a manual VPN or onion-routing technique. Unfortunately, this tactic is very difficult to hide all metadata, so I&#x27;d prefer the first two options over asking users to fuzz their data.<p>Disclosure: I volunteer for Restore the Fourth, which is a 501(c)(4) organization advocating for greater barriers to warrantless or broad surveillance. We are currently focusing on getting local cities to pass privacy policies that limit what data local law enforcement can gather and share.<p>EDIT: I realize that the USPS is a part of the government, but it is not an arm of law enforcement. It should still require a warrant to obtain user tracking data from the USPS just like any other business.",1414503913

Is suspect that he would also argue that throwing out the anti-causal solutions to the wave equation is nothing more that customary, and that Merlin and Chris Nolan would customarily discard causal solutions and keep only the anti-causal ones.<p>What was frustrating for me was that he didn&#x27;t seem define &quot;the flow of time&quot;.

This <i>is</i> a zener diode!  The reason this form of zener is used is simply because the fab does not bother to put in any effort to reduce the avalanche noise.  Noise like that makes zeners sold as zeners unpopular.<p>Zener avalanche noise is unpredictable.  How is an attacker supposed to guess when the next electron/hole pair is going to be created in the depletion region?  Physically, what happens is the emitter-base junction is reverse biased, turning it into a diode that is blocking current from flowing from the emitter to the base.  Every once in a while, due to thermal noise and likely quantum effects, an electron jumps up a valence level, creating an electron/hole pair in the middle of the reversed-biased N/P junction, where there is a strong electric field.  This launches the electron in one direction and the hole in the other, where they gain speed rapidly.  The electron has higher mobility and will gain enough speed to bang into other electron/hole pairs, creating an avalanche of electrons.<p>There is no known way for anyone to guess when the next avalanche will occur, or how large it will be, so long as there is no outside signal controlling this effect.  Implemented poorly, it can just put out power supply noise, and not true unpredictable entropy.  Implemented well, it is a solid, reliable, cheap, and fast entropy source.  It is absolutely critical that a zener noise TRNG has an open auditable design!<p>As for &quot;quantum&quot; effects, I consider that marketing fluff.  What we need is provable, reliable unpredictability, not some radioactive decay or photon emission.  We don&#x27;t need 100% unbiased unpredictability either, just a signal that cannot be predicted with much accuracy.",1414503528

It&#x27;s pretty big because we want it to be a certain size when viewed at 300dpi (ie print quality).<p>Before the build, it&#x27;ll be stored at a folder called &quot;images/&quot; at the root of your project folder. In your markdown text you reference its with its filename only. So you reference it as &quot;![alt text](foo.png)&quot;.<p>If you build with the &quot;--output html&quot; option, the image will be copied over to the output folder, and it&#x27;ll be referenced in the HTML as &quot;<img width=&#x27;415&#x27; height=&#x27;288&#x27; src=&#x27;images/foo.png&#x27;/>&quot;.<p>Note the width and height in the markup are reduced - this is so the image will keep its relative size with the text when viewed at 96dpi, but if you print the page it&#x27;ll still look crisp and nice. (This is what happens when you create a print-ready PDF, too.)<p>If you build with the &quot;--lo-res&quot; option, the image will still be referenced in the HTML as &quot;<img width=&#x27;415&#x27; height=&#x27;288&#x27; src=&#x27;images/foo.png&#x27;/>&quot;, but the file will be reduced to that size when copied.

Cartel activity, like much white collar crime in general, is extremely difficult to prosecute, because the difference between totally legal conduct and illegal conduct comes down to what people are thinking. Instead of being able to point to a huge stash of drugs, cases come down to the fine points of &quot;who knew what when&quot; and &quot;who talked to who and about what.&quot;<p>To impose punitive fines or jail time, you need to bring criminal actions where you need to prove beyond reasonable doubt cases where the proof is in peoples&#x27; heads. Civil fines, on the other hand, have a much lower burden of proof: more likely than not.[1] That&#x27;s why civil penalties and deferred prosecution agreements,[2] have become the tool of choice for regulators.<p>Frankly, you don&#x27;t really want to live in a world where the government can impose criminal penalties on businesses for such loose facts as these. Understandably, banks aren&#x27;t the most sympathetic defendants, but extrapolate this reasoning to the tech industry. Should Bill Gates be in jail for his role in the Microsoft antitrust activity? Should Eric Schmidt be in jail for his role in the employee wage suppression collusion?<p>[1] This description is America centric but the operative law is roughly similar in Europe.<p>[2] A deferred prosecution agreement is a settlement where a company pays a fine, agrees not to do whatever bad thing it did, usually agrees to some number of years of monitoring, in return for which the government defers charges and eventually drops them if the monitoring period ends without incident.",1414503176

8520732,comment,8519801,8519801,0,0,malgorithms,,,"A question for the designers (Paul?) about verifiability. In the software world you can effectively choose from 2 levels of review. You can (1) review the source code of a project and convince yourself it&#x27;s fine. Or (2) you can assume/hope that experts have done that, download the software, and just verify you have an identical copy of what everyone else is reviewing. (Ideally using signatures of the authors and reviewers.)<p>Almost everyone who cares does step 2, assuming they do anything at all.  Very few people are qualified or bother to review source code, but everyone who performs step 2 can feel pretty safe, as long as a release is big enough that it&#x27;s getting reviewed by experts.<p>So, what&#x27;s the hardware equivalent? If I&#x27;m not capable of reviewing the schema of this hardware, but someone I trust says &quot;this is great&quot;, how do I at least know the one I bought is identical to the one she/he bought (or built) and reviewed? How do I verify the components? This seems like a difficult problem.",1414501700

8520721,comment,8519643,8519643,0,0,k2enemy,,,"I use a setup very similar to this on OS X.<p>- After using offlineimap for years, I recently switched to mbsync/isync.  It is way faster and has been much more stable.<p>- After a stint with sup (<a href=""http://supmua.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supmua.org</a>), I&#x27;m now back to mutt.  I really love sup&#x27;s interface, but it was a little too flaky.<p>- I use a script called &quot;mail&quot; that starts a tmux session then launches mutt in it:<p><pre><code>    #!/bin/sh
    tmux -2 new-session -d -s mail -n &#x27;mutt&#x27; &quot;export TERM=screen-256color; mutt&quot;
    tmux select-window -t 1
    tmux attach-session -d -t mail
</code></pre>
Then, in mutt I have the double-quote mapped to a macro that executes a shell command to split the tmux window and launch a read-only instance of mutt:<p><pre><code>    macro index,pager \&quot; &quot;<enter-command> \
        unset wait_key<enter><shell-escape> \
        tmux split-window -h \&quot;mutt -R\&quot;<enter>&quot; &quot;open new mutt&quot;
</code></pre>
This is my way of having an &quot;async compose&quot; pane for writing emails.  I had tried replacing the mutt EDITOR variable with a command that splits the window and launches vim, but there are a lot of annoyances with that approach.  Launching another mutt is way easier, and it also allows for easily viewing two emails at once.<p>That said, there are a lot of nice tips in here that I&#x27;ll incorporate into my setup.

I certainly prefer only being able to receive, as transmitting seems like an attack vector.<p>With the assumption that it only receives, I would strongly prefer that it be left on by default.  Adding a second source to the CRC mixing can only improve entropy, even if the source is controlled by an attacker.  Since the noise from the zener has no simple proof of it&#x27;s entropy output rate, and it can vary over time, and because zener noise TRNGs have been known to be power-supply noise sensitive (not that your&#x27;s is), having that second source gives me much more confidence in the device.",1414501518

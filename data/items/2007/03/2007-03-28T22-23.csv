The firm I was with (and some others who approach it in a similar fashion) all did custom development for this particular business problem.<p>Nothing in the world wrong with consulting, that's for sure.  It's just not scalable.  I'm still completely amazed at how big the Big 4, Sapient, and a few others have gotten.

7097,comment,189,189,0,0,Mistone,,,"comments on relevant sites is a good way to validate a persons ideas, domain knowledge, and thoughtfulness, but my main contribution's have been to TC, AVC, Flickr, and others, so I get no benefit from that here.  Maybe a hot idea for a simple web 2.0 startup would be an aggregation tool of all comments by a user across the sites they use.  Could work well with OpenID. <p>Maybe I'll add that to the question in the application that asks for ""any other ideas you've considered""  :   ",1175122386

7087,comment,7070,7070,0,0,vlad,,,"""A startup is like a bicycle.""  I think only a business person would come up with such an analogy.  Remember, it implies there is somebody else sitting in the seat.<p>And the VC is riding you?  Certainly not your customers, in the early stage, since you may not have any.  And each of the founders we know is already a bicycle wheel, not the rider.  Must be the VC, right?  Remember, business people and large software companies see programmers as cogs or wheels, important only as part of a system.  If you play along with their analogies, you are just asking for trouble.<p>How about a different analogy, which favors us, the software guys?  A startup is like...

7071,comment,7018,7018,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I must comment that the conclusion they arrive at is very interesting: that web-based apps work better for individuals (and also, I presume, small groups), while desktop apps work better for businesses, because a big part of people's justification for web applications is large-scale collaboration.<p>In the article, however, John Milan makes it seem like it's impossible to integrate a web app with a business infrastructure.  I don't think that this is a necessary property of web applications.  The problem is that most web applications now are ad-based, and they want their consumers' only access point to be through their website, where they can get revenue.  If that model is changed, it would not be overly complicated to create an API to your application which would allow integration with other applications in some way.  If I can use sshfs to make a remote filesystem look exactly like a local one, surely it's possible to write hooks into your web app to integrate it with other desktop software.",1175119682

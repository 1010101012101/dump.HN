I was still trying to understand what the app did before I reached this, so it seemed disjointed that you were trying to convince me it was worthing paying for your service before I understood your service.<p>/// White iPhone - it took me a while to realize it's a was an iPhone.  I thought it was a nice border around your screenshot.  Perhaps showing more of the phone would make me realize that it's an iPhone or at least mobile app.<p>/// Three blue links next to ""download app"" button.  As a new user to your website I want to know more about what specifically invy app does.  If we look wpengine.com from the left to right links are: about / blog / reviews / our customers / contact.  I would have expected something along the same lines.  Customer reviews / some type of blog / how awesome my life will be after I use this, etc.  The press didn't really fit (especially when I went to the press page and was greeted by : Hello press people :) and an offer to contact you about press related inquiries.<p>Overall - I like the design though think you have to spend more time honing the right message to the right customer and what specific problem you are solving for them.

Why would one want to teach at a university when (s)he has enough skills to work at a company for a big fat compensation, and, possibly, equity? The only way to attract those people to the universities would be for the universities to offer much higher salaries, which would consequently drive up the cost of education (in my own country it wouldn't even work, because education is ""free"", i.e. mostly paid for by the government). \nAnd for what - to teach the students something they could have easily picked up on their own by poking around the internets or participating in internships? That is not optimal.\nIf you study formal grammars in class and don't try writing your own little lexer/parser at home, it's your own fault, don't blame the university.

They're not, say, Excel files, which I assume the average user will expect. AFAICT they're shortcuts into Google Docs, which I didn't really need since I know where those are already, to a close-enough approximation. So now on my local drive I have two classes of spreadsheet. Real spreadsheets and links to my online spreadsheets, which kinda mirrors normal hyperlinks to online spreadsheets, so we have two classes of those now as well. I can't really predict what will happen if I download the file as Excel and put it into my Google Drive directory. I guess I'll have two files, but will my newly created Excel file be a new doc online? What will happen if I delete the local links?<p>Created a text file in my local drive. Waited. Nothing appeared in Docs. Right-click the file to ""sync"", no menu item. Right-click the directory, no menu item. Click different Docs directories. Nothing. At some point, it appeared. That's a temporary issue and can be fixed, but those details count.<p>Dropbox/Sugarsync feels a bit more predictable. I'll sync, that's it. I have a button I can push to make it do something predictable. Seems less magical.<p>File sync is a square hole. Google Docs is a round peg. Feels like the reasoning behind this is boardroom-strategy-level, not user-level.<p>Right now Dropbox/Sugarsync will keep my business. Earlier today I put one minute towards grandfathering a Skydrive account to 25GB free, just in case that proves useful. Hope I'm wrong and Google Drive feels more useful tomorrow.",1335299569

There is a massive selection bias, and if nothing is done to alleviate this, your site runs the risk of becoming a soap box for ranting.<p>This is the risk we take listening to ANYTHING depending on voluntary responses.  Burying negative reviews to attempt some intrinsic rating dismisses the value in actual user input, with the paternalistic view that the review aggregator somehow knows better. Who decides which and how many negative reviews to hide? You? How about letting the user figure it out, knowing that trusting any opinion is a risk and learning from experience to calibrate reviews he reads to himself? It's the best we can hope for without resorting to the review site, in effect, clobbering consensus views to get something it ""knows to be more accurate."" In that case the users no longer review, but the site, which is not a user, does.<p>> If you receive 2 bad reviews and 2 good ones, that does not mean 50% of people are dissatisfied.<p>You absolutely do not know this.

At the same time, it doesn't seem to be a goal of management to create a company that entices investors.

I used Yelp to try to find a good local cafe to eat at in Irvine. Drove right to the spot indicated on the map and found an industrial complex. Had to look up the business name on Google Maps to find that it was about five miles South of where Yelp told me the cafe was.<p>Same thing happened again in Vegas, looking for a nice place to eat, find something that looks interesting and then see that Yelp places it in an industrial complex nearby. This time I don't expect to find the place, but I drive by and find myself somewhere in a dark alley full of closed-for-the-evening auto shops.<p>I'll still use Yelp to find the name of a business, but then I have to switch to Google Maps and do a reality check to actually see if the business is near by and how to get there.

That is why they count your own and shared for free accounts.<p>But they do the same counting for paid accounts even when all parties involved are paying.

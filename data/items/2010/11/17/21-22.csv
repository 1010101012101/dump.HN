I once had to email Jeff Atwood because I had managed to create two accounts with two different identities (this was long ago, before you were able to associate multiple OpenID identities to a single user), and to this day I still don't remember which ones work with the user that has the highest reputation. So I don't even bother logging in most of the time, and choose a random login every time I do.<p>OpenID's biggest end-user benefit was supposed to cut down on the number of disparate accounts people tend to have across multiple websites, and it became moot when everyone and their mother decided that they needed to be the be-all end-all of OpenID providers by turning your login details and identity with that website into an OpenID or OpenID type identity.",1290030686

This is an unfolded protein molecule and demonstrates that mitochondria mostly don't make their own proteins, they have to be imported. Mitochondria have an inner and an outer membrane so it has to go through two layers.<p>We follow it through the inner membrane and see the glory of the mitochondrial interior. We zoom past (and through) a bunch of proteins that are involved in oxidizing fuel molecules. There's a double helix DNA in the corner to remind us that mitochondria do synthesize some of their own proteins.<p>We next zoom in on a piece of the inner membrane. studded with protein complexes and surrounded by glowing molecules. Note that some of the proteins have their bottom part spinning - these are ATP synthase, one of the most amazing of proteins.<p>[Out of time now, will write more later...]",1290028027

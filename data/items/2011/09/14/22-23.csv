A lot of the metaphor comes from the fact that JavaScript is actually compiled down to assembly in software like v8.  X to JS compilers can even take advantage of that knowledge as well and produce optimized JS for those compilers (I'm sure GWT leverages this)  So yes, JavaScript is more like C in that sense, but C compiles so ridiculously close to assembly that it's practically just there to make system calls and memory management easy for you.<p>So, if anything Javascript is the common language of distribution, or the English of the web.",1316041071

JavaScript is plagued with libraries that will only ever run on certain platforms because they opt-in to platform specific features. I can't use your simple pluralization library to turn ""bit"" into ""bits"", because it was only written to run on Node.js, and is riddled with `forEach` and `require`, or because it was only written for the browser, and hides data in the DOM.<p>CoffeeScript tries very hard to compile into efficient, lowest-common-denominator JavaScript (read avoid Internet Explorer bugs) because that's how your library can be used widely across devices and runtimes, while being reasonably future proof.<p>I don't know when ""order of magnitude difference"" became a synonym for ""worthwhile difference"", but ... how much easier does a program have to be to read and write before it becomes a worthwhile choice to make the change? 2x? 1.3x?<p>In any case, CoffeeScript is a little thought experiment -- not a corporate project, or a Dart-like browser takeover.

Besides the embarrassing physical symptoms described by others (basically uncontrollable explosive bloody diarrhea) it takes a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is a big embarrassing secret. Add in the why me questions, depression, self-esteem issues and your life becomes an unending roller coaster. Autoimmune conditions are weird. They flare and go away with no rhyme or reason. You can be fine one day and in the hospital the next. No Dr. knows what causes it and no Dr can fix it. The only treatment is trying different chemicals to find one where the treatment is not worse than the disease. Her current treatment of a once a month infusion costs her medical insurance $14k a month?! She is imprisoned by her medical insurance and worries about losing it every day. It is something little understood by healthy non chronic illness people. You need to work to have insurance, but when you are most sick, and sick a lot - you can't work. So fundamentally having health insurance attached to ability to work is just wrong. Someone can talk about their heart attack, or cancer, or diabetes and everyone gets it. Talk about IBD you get a blank look. Talk about the details and no one will ever bring it up again. If you try to stay general and say I have an autoimmune condition people also don't understand and think you have HIV/AIDS. It is tragic because a huge growing number of people suffer from a large spectrum of autoimmune disorders (prob caused by genetic predisposition and long term exposure to low level chemicals in plastic, herbicides, pesticides, etc...) that are prob related in some way but because of how the med establishment treats them separately, they never gain the traction or interest of the medical research community. So that equals no dollars and money mostly flowing towards newsworthy cause such as popular cancers, heart, diabetes etc. No one wants to find the cure for explosive bloody diarrhea. They want to save lives. Tragi-comic stuff. Very sad. On that uplifting note Kudos and thank you for creating something that can help. It is much needed since the disease symptoms and treatment are basically different for every person that suffers from it.",1316038637

They also have a court system that handles corporate matters in separate equity courts instead of through the regular jury-based courts. This streamlines complex litigation and gets you judges experiences in such matters. This can be a real advantage if you are the kind of company that is expecting complicated issues relating to shareholders or corporate governance, which is why many large public companies incorporate there.<p>Some prominent examples of big public companies NOT incorporated in Delaware are Apple (California) and Microsoft (Washington). (Microsoft has bounced around--they incorporated in Washington in 1981, then reincorporated in Delaware in 1986 and then reincorporated back in Washington in 1993 where they have stayed).<p>Nevada is popular for many small companies because it has good protections on privacy if you want to keep your name out of the public record associated with your company.",1316038113

Contrary to your claim, Tesla <i>does</i> compete directly with BMW, for the same sales dollars, in the same part of the market, providing a solution to the same audience, and even segment, and in the same problem space.  If we can&#x27;t agree on even the definition of &quot;compete&quot;, it&#x27;s unlikely that we can further each other&#x27;s understanding.<p>Also, the idea that &#x27;if they succeed&#x27; (not a quote) then &quot; this will only diminish returns in the industry as whole so will be anyway bad investment&quot; (your comment) is just contrary to the experience of any other startup that succeeds.<p>It&#x27;s just bad economics.

Nature doesn&#x27;t care about our health. Organisms have been competing for millennia for advantages. If a tree&#x27;s seed sprouted better from your warm dead body, then that tree would happily poison you.<p>In fact foods we eat in nature can be regarded as those that kill us too slowly to notice - we avoid the others.<p>And cultivated crops are those we&#x27;ve bred to have less and less of the undesirable parts. We&#x27;ve inserted ourselves into the plants&#x27; genetic path for mutual benefit - we plant millions of them, and they feed us.<p>To eat truly &#x27;natural&#x27; you&#x27;d have to eat things like crab-apples (grainy and bad ph - eat more than one and get a stomach ache) or tiny barely-sweet melons etc.  Melons a thousand years ago were barely larger than an orange, with a couple of tablespoons&#x27; worth of edible parts.

Ideally, yes, everyone should be doing versioned backups to a zfs storage cluster. In practice, no, lots of people have just enough motivation to get an external drive and start making copies onto it.<p>That said, I am planning to add versioning and I am looking at adopting git&#x27;s packfiles for that purpose.

Most (all?) depictions in nature are overwhelmingly <i>sparse</i> --in the SP sense--, and so most plausible instances of minor variations like &quot;changing one pixel&quot; could arguably be produced in a quasi prefix-free / constant overhead manner from the same underlying English language description.

But that change is often incremental, not huge bounds forward (e.g. AT&T in their halycon days, or HP pre-electronics, examples of huge bounds made by incumbant firms)<p>Disagree:  Incremental change (one less click to do X, or $5 dollars off purchase of Y) _is_ important, as when multiplied across multiple product types in multiple industries, such &#x27;disruption&#x27;, &#x27;innovation&#x27; or &#x27;change&#x27; can have effects that not only have a small effect, but sometimes hit tipping points.  Toyota / pull-based scheduling / LEAN as a big-corp type example.<p>This view comes from the motivation to embark on a small project right now.  Production (of a physical product) enriches those that have the economies of scale to produce it (manufacturer) that I am not seeking to &#x27;disrupt&#x27; (or, continue to make the same people rich as the title puts it), but to create search, delivery and cost savings for the customer.

For why that&#x27;s a bad idea, consider this example (from the original bug implementing this behavior, <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/3147"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/3147</a>):<p><pre><code>    let {f, g, h, _} = move foo\n</code></pre>\n(The `move` keyword is no longer in Rust, but local variables with a type implementing Drop are implicitly moved, not shallow-copied, when used as an rvalue, since it is only safe to run a destructor once on the same structure).<p>The problem is that there&#x27;s no obvious place to run the destructor.  Destruction for items with the Drop trait in Rust proceeds as follows: first the value&#x27;s destructor is run, then the value is completely destroyed, and then the values of any of its children are run.  Clearly, then, the destructor must be run after the let, or the item&#x27;s fields would be uninitialized at destruction time--but there&#x27;s no longer any available reference to the item upon which Drop can be run.<p>There&#x27;s at least one proposal to fix this floating out there (<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11855"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/11855</a>).  The basic idea is to alter destruction semantics so that the three steps of destruction can be split up.  This would allow Rust to run the destructor for the original item, then move any referenced fields out of the item, then destroy the item, and then run the field-level destructors for any items going out of scope.",1405263807

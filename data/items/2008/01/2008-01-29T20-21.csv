It feels a bit goofy at first, but it's really nice once you get used to it (There's this riser thing that goes on the front, so it puts your hands in a position where they fall down from the wrist instead of angling up).  I work IT for a small city government, and the dispatchers in the police department -love- them.  Hit up newegg (or your preferred hardware seller) and search for fa6-00010.  The included mouse isn't too bad either.<p>Another recommendation that may sound stupid but is actually great: get a gamer mousepad...one of those gigantic ones with a nice wrist rest.  I use a Razer eXactMat, and I love it.  The bigger mousepad makes it much easier to get in the habit of mousing with your arm, not your wrist.",1201640393

106381,comment,105739,106304,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Obama looks, sounds, and acts presidential, and the disproof was in some way or another inadequate.</i><p>The assertion was ""Obama simply looks presidential"", not ""sounds"" or ""acts"". I displayed the portraits of ALL PRIOR PRESIDENTS, and NONE OF THEM LOOK LIKE OBAMA. Even if that as-perfect-as-humanly-possible disproof was somehow ""inadequate"", the proof in the first place was completely absent...only a bald declaration.<p>By ""party mouths"" I mean the ""four legs good"" people who do the talking. The left media has been falling over itself to kiss Obama's ass from Day 1 until the present--and I don't predict that will change. Clinton, by contrast, has been viewed quite negatively.<p><i>Would you feel the same about an Obama/Edwards ticket?</i><p>I don't see that happening. Edwards has already been an unsuccessful #2, and I don't think he would do it again.<p><i>What reason do you have to think that Romney won't be winning the nomination?</i><p>A gut feeling. The media, for reasons unknown, has been handling madman McCain very gently. You know, I'm just reading chicken entrails [1] here, don't you? It is pyschologically interesting to me how someone could utter ""Obama looks presidential""...it is received wisdom, because there's no way a brain could derive such falsehood on its own. If I passed by Mitt Romney on the street, I'd probably think, ""That guys looks like the VP in charge of operations at an auto parts factory"". McCain looks like a retired security guard. Edwards looks just like a trial lawyer, of course.<p>But if I saw Obama, I might think, ""That guy looks like a schoolteacher."" That's what he looks like. To think he ""looks presidential"", you'd have to be pretty damn brainwashed.<p>[1] I mean, public declarations by candidates, coverage by the media, operations of the parties, etc, are all one or two or three steps removed from the truth. You have to guess at what's really happening...",1201639160

They often involve 'in-jokes' that you'd have to be a bit computer culture / scientifically inclined to get (either in the comic itself or the tooltip) that qualify as clever, and nearly all of them are clever in the sense presenting a common experience / situation of fans of the comic and presenting it in a way that all will find funny.",1201638242

106358,comment,106137,106137,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I liked the article at first because it was pointing out the flawed hypocrisy in the education/job market, where you are expected to learn and show knowledge of something you're not likely to use. Moreover, I <i>want</i> to be the lazy programmer. The lazy programmer does more with less lines of code in addition to using the IDE more effectively. One paragraph in particular that I agreed with was:<p><i>You were lazy. Now, laziness is said to be a virtue in a programmer. And if you want to be one of those super-smart programmers who can tell me why the only birds you need are Starlings and Kestrels, you might start a company that we buy for big bucks. But quite honestly, we don't appreciate laziness in someone we are hiring to toil away in the bowels of our enterprise application code.</i><p>I agree totally. Clearly the problem is that it is necessary to ""toil away"". Now the example used was recursion, and I totally understand the need to know recursion and data structures, but it could easily be extended to databases or networking protocols. To expect someone to know a skill which is not going to be needed on the job is unfair.<p>So what is my problem with the article? In the comments, the author is totally bashing this programmer. The failure does not lie with the programmer, but with the system.",1201637836

Or it could be that the chemical causes memories of one's children, and everyone in the study has happy memories of their children.<p>So, the causation is still in doubt. Many explanations are consistent with the observed data.<p>---<p>Yes I am proposing that chemicals correlate with ""aggression"" in humans and rats for different reasons. But I don't accept that the thing called ""aggression"" is the same thing in humans, and in rats. To help illustrate why not, consider aggressive behavior by video game characters.

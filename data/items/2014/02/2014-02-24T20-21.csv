Deadlines here mean delivering the packets in time for the next simulation timestep.<p>Yeah, that’s what happens in most RTS, if the feedback for the action you sent doesn’t come back before Xms, then the game pauses and waits (for example Starcraft 2 does that).<p>And I know the lock step mechanism used in some RTS, I’m implementing one myself. But I don’t see how it makes it non-real-time. If quake or teeworlds associates a network packet (containing a player-position) with a frame, does that make it really-fast turn-based game (with turns being frames, or ticks, or what you want to call them)?<p>That being said,<p>> You and I agree on everything except the definition of &quot;real-time&quot;.<p>No, the “real-time” word is really not that important to me, I mostly disagree with you saying “TCP is […] useless for multi player gaming.”<p>RTS, or MMORPG, or turn-based tactical RPG, or card games are not “some exceptions”. They probably even represent a huge proportion of the multiplayer games out there. I now understand that you were talking about “fast-paced action games like quake or the likes”, but that really didn’t sound like it.<p>> I&#x27;m sorry if my words were a bit overgeneralized and it annoys you.<p>This is not just you, I’ve seen a lot of these “— TCP sucks for all online game purposes!\n— but what about all these cases were it’s fine?\n— Oh, I was obviously talking about those other cases”<p>But that’s ok, I’ve made my point public instead of grumbling in my head, now I’m fine and we can move on. :)",1393275416

7293371,comment,7289845,7290536,1,0,LukeHoersten,,,"I really feel like Snap is a much more pragmatic approach to types. Where Yesod uses tons of metaprogramming and DSLs to make HTML and CSS type safe, Snap focuses on being a great Haskell system and HTML/CSS continue to be whatever they are. In practice this seems to be a good trade off because to get type safety in HTML/CSS the way Yesod does, you take on a lot of complexity and black magic.<p>The one place I wish I had better type safety in Snap is the SQL level. Yesod has Persistent which you can use with Snap but Persistent follows the same &quot;black magic&quot; design principles. I really wish there was a tool that handled PostgreSQL-specific query type checking and migration and that&#x27;s it. No JSON/noSQL to SQL abstraction etc (which is cool if you want it but just a lot of if you don&#x27;t).

Samsung was likely peeved, since the S4 beats the iPhone on pretty much everything else, but critics blasted them for the memory - which was a fair criticism, see below.<p>Samsung relented and indicated 32GB and 64GB variants would be available, created spec sheets, even put some into the hands of reviewers.<p>But try buying one. Samsung and its carriers are convinced that 16GB, max 32GB, is all most people will need, which, for the carriers, is self-serving, because the less room you have on your phone, the more data you use - and carriers ding for data.<p>Apple understands storage requirements, primarily because of iTunes: Your music, etc., are local, and synced. Consumers with music collections are largely on iPhone; Samsung and Google want to differentiate themselves, somehow, but don&#x27;t have a full clue. Google wants you to stream everything, so they believe you can live with less space.<p>Yeah, maybe in downtown NYC, but try streaming in rural or even semi-rural Ontario sometime.<p>So Samsung is playing bait and switch. Part of me is pissed beyond all reasonable belief.

But knowing I wouldn&#x27;t have to muck with external SD cards anymore.<p>My admin orders the phone, a 16GB arrives, I say &quot;whoa, what&#x27;s up&quot;, she does some research, I am gobsmacked, I do some research, validating hers and leading to the above rant.<p>Lying bastiches.<p>My next phone will be a decent Android phone with 64GB of internal storage - 64GB available to me, not 8GB sucked up by the OS thank you Samsung - and no bloatware. Anyone? Anyone?

It is comparatively very easy to hide malicious code in a closed-source binary.<p>4) If there is cleanly-building source available, not only users but many <i>vendors</i> (including most Linux distros) will package their own version from that. Many people who don&#x27;t build the source themselves will still get a clean version.<p>5) The risk of discovery would be high and the consequences, catastrophic.

And of course in most places that could happen, the cable company lobbies to prevent it.<p>So it isn&#x27;t competitive at all. Though it is honestly hard to be competitive with infrastructure - how would you go about having multiple redundant private highways going to the same place just to maintain competition so that one road doesn&#x27;t milk toll rates and let the quality degrade because they have a monopoly?

Hence why many smart people disagree on the issue.<p>The difference is meta-ethical.  The TBTF argument is fundamentally a utilitarian one - it&#x27;s saying, &quot;This is distasteful, but we&#x27;re going to do it anyway because we believe it will result in a better final outcome.&quot;  The Libertarian take on the issue frames it in a fundamentally deontological light, as you have. It&#x27;s concerned with the actions themselves, and doesn&#x27;t even attempt to speculate on long-term practical consequences of any particular choice of action because they aren&#x27;t relevant to the argument under that particular framing.<p>Which is fine, both are legitimate approaches to ethics.  What bothers me is when the two camps start just talking past each other.  Which is what seems to be happening when one makes a statement such as &quot;the morally superior one should be relatively obvious&quot; in this context.  In terms of persuasiveness, it&#x27;s reminiscent of the Verizon &quot;Which one is bigger?&quot; ad campaign - there&#x27;s an attempt to get at something legitimate there, but it&#x27;s overshadowed by a rhetorical approach that could make even the best argument in the world feel unpersuasive.",1393272184

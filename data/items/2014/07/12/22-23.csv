They both speak English, and the British were the main land-owning settlers to North America. People like Washington, Jefferson and Franklin had British surnames. The revolution was simply another step in shifting the capital of the English-speaking people from London to Washington. Another step was World War Two when the US let the British go broke fighting the Germans, then stepped in in 1941 to save the day, taking control of the world&#x27;s sea lanes from Britain. So before the revolution we had the &quot;British Empire and its American colonies&quot;, nowadays we have the United States of America in a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the United Kingdom, via defence and security treaties such as UKUSA and ABCA.<p>The movement of the English-speaking people&#x27;s power center from London to Washington thus took 150 years, longer than the ongoing Russian move from St Petersburg to Moscow, but shorter than the Song move from Xian to Hangzhou.",1405203694

It was so part and parcel of the system that if they had, instead, been building luxury high rises in the big city, you would have seen similar stipulations. I thus see no reason to conclude that suburbanization was motivated by a goal of specifically getting away from blacks. It was motivated by people who had lived hand-to-mouth during the recession finally having the means and ability to buy a single family home of their own.<p>I am well aware that racism ran very, very deep at the time. For example, the federal minimum wage law was originally intended to get the South in line with other parts of the nation in terms of what it paid and it was a de facto attempt to outlaw the practice of paying blacks about half what whites got paid for the same work. It was passed prior to WWII. It was failing terribly. The initial result was that blacks got fired in droves (which is part of what drove blacks out of rural Southern states into big cities of the Northern states). They weren&#x27;t able to make it stick at all until after WWII began.<p>So I know racism ran deep. It was open. It was intractable. And it was not, per se, the reason whites invented the suburbs and moved there. Unprecedented middle class wealth was the driving force behind the invention of the suburbs. Blacks tended to be left out because blacks were generally left out economically. They also would have been left out had well off whites invented some other housing solution.

I&#x27;ve been following bitcoin for a while now, and still learning little nuances of the bitcoin protocol everyday.<p>For instance, I just learnt recently that there&#x27;s transaction cost associated with each transaction, and if you set the transaction cost to zero, the transaction may take a while to get accepted (or never) into the blockchain because of the reduced incentive to miners.<p>This comes as a bit of surprise to me because one of the popular benefits of bitcoin touted by advocates is the reduced transaction fee over traditional means of monetary payments, but I guess that&#x27;s a fault in my own understanding as &#x27;reduced&#x27; does not mean &#x27;none&#x27;.<p>The complexity of the concept is a barrier to the mass adoption of bitcoin. Wallet and payment merchants make it easy for people to use bitcoin without understanding the underlying technology, however I believe there&#x27;s still a perception problem. People are hesitant to use things they can&#x27;t wrap their minds around, especially when it&#x27;s tied to money.<p>We need more articles like this that can ELI5 to lower that barrier.",1405202758

For example, mutagenesis can be a process in which chemical or radiation stress \nis applied on a cell to force mutation to happen, but it also commonly occurs in nature and \nat least some of the mutagenesis chemicals are derived from nature.

It is not clear at which point traditional breeding \ntechniques are divided from modern or non-traditional breeding techniques. Is there a time \npoint at which all techniques before that time are considered traditional and all new \ntechniques developed after that time are not considered traditional? The use of \ntransposons (see below Part B) since the 1930&#x27;s or chemical, physical, and biological \nmutagens since the 1940&#x27;s are blurring the distinction between traditional breeding and \nbiotechnology.&quot;",1405202599

Has Reddit proven itself as a net gain for us, or have billions of hours of productivity been squandered laughing at the latest meme or lolcat.<p>I actually joined HN a few years ago, but decided to leave my old account. I would probably stop looking at when people joined as some measure of their worth if I were you.<p>As for your last statement. I like playing on computers. I love building fun things.

Swig is an interesting project too.<p>The problem I have with swig is that it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed and simplicity of the code.

The Windows ecosystem has had to deal with this for a long time.  Windows XP was released twelve years ago and the installed base is huge.  For the most part you can still use any current Windows software with XP and anything in between.<p>Apple is somewhat famous for summarily killing off whole product lines in the interest of technological innovation.  I get it.  No issues there.<p>However, as their installed base expands it will be increasingly hard for the average person to stomach the idea of their expensive computers or iOS devices becoming obsolete.  Not everyone lives on the bleeding edge.  In fact, most people don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to watch what happens.  It sure feels like the rate of innovation might have slowed down a bit.  Thinner and lighter only go so far.<p>There are a few surprising things here and there.  For example, I can&#x27;t understand why Apple didn&#x27;t acquire Bump [0] and and tightly integrate that capability both iOS and OSX.  Google grabbed them instead.

The DSA construction has what is probably the strictest randomness requirement in all of mainstream cryptography; a bias of just a few bits is, with repeated signatures, sufficient to recover private keys! (The attack that makes this work on ECDSA is <i>extraordinarily cool</i>).<p>The problem with NIST Dual_EC_DRBG is simpler than the article makes it sounds. A good mental model for Dual_EC is that it&#x27;s a CSRPNG specification with a public key baked into it (in this case, an ECC public key) --- but no private key. The &quot;backdoor&quot; in Dual_EC is the notion that NSA --- err, Clyde Frog --- who is confirmed to have generated Dual_EC, holds the private key and can reconstruct the internal state of the CSPRNG using it. I think this problem is simple enough that we may do a crypto challenge on a toy model of Dual_EC.<p>Nobody in the real world really uses Dual_EC, but that may not always have been historically true; the circumstantial evidence about it is damning.<p>The NIST ECC specifications are in general now totally discredited.

But the latest computers and phones are hardly innovative: Compared to what you got 5 years ago, they might be smaller and have better power efficiency. But on the grand scale, how does that matter?<p>If you see the latest Macbooks being introduced, you probably want to get one. It&#x27;s very shiny and the Retina screen will allow you to <i>experience</i> computing in a great way. People try to become happy by spending money for experiences. Tourism, iPhones, hipster coffee shops. They don&#x27;t do it because it&#x27;s the universal recipe for happiness and living your life, but because it&#x27;s what capitalist societies expect you to do. Most &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;disruption&quot; only leads to zero-sum money shifts inside this system. If you think that a retina screen is innovative, i think you need to get some perspective.<p>The same goes for cars. The Germans (where I come from) think that they&#x27;re innovative because we have a few luxury car makers here. Cars in general are great, they provide mobility and that&#x27;s useful. But how are the new cars better than what was available 30 years ago? They&#x27;re not even more fuel efficient.<p>Bill Gates seems to have got it when he stopped working full-time at Microsoft. All over the world people are using their software, but if we were using OS/2 and Lotus instead of Windows and Office nothing would change.

Right now we&#x27;re in the first major phase of Bitcoin&#x27;s evolution, wherein the global financial system slowly wraps it&#x27;s collective brain around what Bitcoin is, how it behaves, and what it&#x27;s good for.<p>Even experts in cryptocurrency don&#x27;t agree about any of those things, so global consensus about those three things is a long way off.<p>A few basics are starting to emerge:<p>* Bitcoin is good for transactions that governments don&#x27;t want you to make.<p>* Bitcoin is good for transactions between vastly different financial and legal systems.<p>* Bitcoin is good for storing money in your brain.<p>* Some subset of people feel Bitcoin is a good investment.<p>But even now, there are many people with money, not to mention many financial experts, who are not so sure about these things. With every WSJ article we creep closer and closer to consensus, but it is still quite far off.<p>That said, eventually the global financial markets will start to agree about these uses, and a generally accepted model will emerge. I suspect this will take at least 20 years, which is the length of time it will take for us to start having University Faculty who went through their entire undergraduate education with Bitcoin existing and at least partially understood by their professors.<p>That model will be something like:<p><pre><code>    Bitcoin market cap = I + f(V)
</code></pre>
where V = volume of global transactions for which Bitcoin is the best choice<p>f(V) = the float required to make those transactions<p>I = the amount of capital for which Bitcoin is the best investment vehicle<p>And of course we need models for each of these... V is going to be some portion of illegal transactions, some portion of inter-border transactions, etc. We really have no idea what this is right now.<p>Until then the price of Bitcoin will be very chaotic, which will influence the I term, but not the V term. The V term is just a pure result of how many people have need for a Bitcoin-like currency, and what percentage of those people are aware of Bitcoin and have the technical means to use it.<p>BUT, when the global financial markets do start to reach consensus on the model, then Bitcoin will stabilize.  And I don&#x27;t mean it will stabilize as a deflationary currency, I mean it will literally be flat. Because the financial markets have NO problem pricing deflation into their models and they absolutely will. The price will go up to where you can&#x27;t make money investing in Bitcoin during a reasonable slice of a human lifetime, and then level off.<p>And I suspect Bitcoin will stabilize MUCH more than traditional currencies.  Because there will be no capriciousness of international politics or policy, the Bitcoin price model will be based on much more stable factors: global crime, global population, etc. And those things are much easier to model than things like U.S. foreign policy.<p>So anyone who is thinking either A) Bitcoin has a chance at stabilizing in the next 10 years, B) Bitcoin will deflate forever, or C) Bitcoin will never stabilize, I just don&#x27;t agree.

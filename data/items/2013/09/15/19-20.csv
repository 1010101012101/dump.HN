I do think that Democracy is more sensitive to national separatism than other forms of government. The great multiethnic empires of history weren&#x27;t democratic. The Chinese have held together a multiethnic society for 3,000 years without holding a vote.<p>The Northern coalition in the Afghanistan civil war was composed of many ethnic groups fighting together against the Pashtun south. There is enough common ground between the groups of the north that a two state solution may suffice.<p>Nationalism is a powerful force that has great appeal to human psychology. Every successful multi-ethnic, multi-religious, or multi-lingual empire has to address it. Even the Canadians have struck an uneasy balance between the French speaking Quebecois and the rest of the country. Separation was a close thing.<p>And nationalism doesn&#x27;t skip Europe. Try to find Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia on a map. And soon Spain might be joining them in the historical deadpool if the Catalan independence movement gets its way.",1379274905

Yes the sentences are complete but how self-sufficient are they?  It&#x27;s a sliding scale from no comma to comma to period.  Some of these rules are not hard and fast.  The art of writing is slowly evolving and to a degree it&#x27;s a matter of taste.  Some people love hyphens.  In this case there&#x27;s a strong enough correlation, conceptual link between the sentences such that the reader doesn&#x27;t need a comma to read what you&#x27;re saying in one breath.  If it sounds good in one breath, that&#x27;s a strong signal you don&#x27;t need a comma.  Knowing the basic rules is just the beginning.  I&#x27;m dead serious.",1379274885

The only real reasons to use them in first stages^ is that you can store them in the rocket <i>(problematic with cryogenic fuels/oxidizers like LH2 and LOX since they will boil off over a short period of time)</i> and the ignition system is simpler <i>(not really a big deal)</i>.<p>LOX/RP-1 was actually used with earlier ICBMs like the Soviet <i>R-7</i>, the American <i>Atlas</i>.  Storable hypergolic fuel mixes followed these, though now modern ICBMs are solid fuel rockets (storable, and safe for people on the ground).<p>Hypergolic fuel mixes have caused issues for non-military rockets too.

There are scads of philosophy professors who simply sneer at those from the opposing tradition.  This is a shame.<p>Third, and related to the point above, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air to read someone who can genuinely straddle the two traditions.

There is a strong sense of identity of being Zambian in parallel to the tribal identity. One way of achieving this was stationing secondary school students(almost all secondary schools are boarding schools) and young public employees (and in 70s quasi-socialist Zambia almost everyone with a job was a public employee) in regions other that their original tribal region. As a result, very many people married into different tribes, and very many people now have several tribal identites, which as a result aren&#x27;t very strong.<p>Also they are indoctrinated that &#x27;tribalism&#x27; is a bad thing, and they learn a lot about Bismarck in school.

This prevents them from understanding the failure of post-colonialism.<p>Throughout Africa and the Middle East we see countries with straight borders that used to be colonies of Western powers. These powers left and left behind democratic governments. These governments are plagued by the fact that the <i>countries</i> they rule over are not <i>nations</i>.<p>A country is a political entity - a set of borders enforced by an army. A nation is a psycho-social entity. It is a group that people identify with, normally composed based on ethnic, linguistic, or religious similarity. Nationhood marks an in-group. Americans have an anti-nationalist, universalist ideology, so their brains reject this reality to the detriment of the places their armies occupy.<p>In most post-colonial countries, there are many different nations within an arbitrary border. Democracy does not work because the citizens don&#x27;t see themselves as the same <i>people</i>. When a person gets power in the government, of course he turns into a &quot;kleptocrat&quot; instead of working for the common good because he doesn&#x27;t value the &quot;common good&quot;. He values the good of his people.<p>These post-colonial countries are also prone to civil war. If one ethno-religious group gets the majority over another, the losing group doesn&#x27;t see the government as legitimate. So there is war and genocide. The post-colonial idealists in the West have done more damage to the world than the colonialists ever did through the proxy of civil war.<p>Democracy in the Congo led to decades of Civil War and now we even see Bantus eating Pygmies[1] - rape, disfigurement, and even cannibalism have become weapons in a brutal civil war. Likewise, if American troops leave Afghanistan, we will see a recap of the 90&#x27;s civil war between the northern and southern ethnic groups.<p>There is no &quot;Afghan&quot; people - there are Pashtun and Tajik and Uzbek[2]. And they were on the tail-end of a civil war before the USA invaded, and now the USA wants them to <i>vote together</i>. What insanity. In an ominous sign, no Pashtun will join the &quot;national&quot; Afghan army. Putting people within the same borders and putting a single army in control over them doesn&#x27;t magically make them care about each other.<p>This is leaving behind the absurdity of trying to impose Western norms on an African continent lacking thousands of years of western history with literature, law, and democracy. You don&#x27;t get to Tom Paine without Cato - and there was a 1700 year process connecting the two. Western thinking about the rest of the world is full of unicorns and pixie dust.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/09/congo.jamesastill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/09/congo.jamesasti...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://origins.osu.edu/sites/default/files/2-12-map586.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://origins.osu.edu/sites/default/files/2-12-map586.jpg</a>",1379273032

Specifically the important point is that the extremely obsolete nature of that design means that its short-comings should have little to no bearing on the relative risk of building <i>new</i> nuclear power plants.<p>Additionally, even with all the problems of Fukushima, many of which are avoidable, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that those problems did not occur spontaneously. Somehow we&#x27;ve apparently forgotten about the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and 40 meter high tsunami which killed over 15,000 people while also causing severe damage to the Fukushima reactors. These are not usual operating circumstances. Somehow we give a pass to other technologies that have failed and caused injury to humans after being impacted by extreme natural disasters yet nuclear power must stand on its own.<p>And yet even despite that and despite many many missteps in the response the Fukushima disaster has not pushed nuclear power into being less safe than any other base load power generation technology, even hydroelectric!<p>That&#x27;s almost astounding, but it cuts to the deep failures that humans tend to make when they attempt to judge relative risk of extremely dissimilar things (like flying vs. driving, rock climbing vs. eating cheeseburgers, or nuclear power vs. coal).",1379272492

Brazilian army actually made a phone with cryptography, which the president and her ministers just refused to use.<p>The response the telecom ministry gave to the wiretapping scandal of the e-mails was to ask for the brazilian mail to make a secure e-mail system, stating: &quot;if they have been safely delivering mail for 350 years, they surely are to be trusted making a e-mail system&quot;.<p>As a sidenote, there is very few data security in the brazilian governemt, with a call to a friend who is a junior analyst in a bureau of statistics I can get a list of ALL brazilians sorted by the local equivalent of the Social Security Number. No access logs whatsoever.<p>I hear some departments actually implemented decent security, but the current state of affairs is a total mess.",1379271825

Poland had the Soviet occupiers and Africa had various European powers organizing the countries. None of the places was good places to live during the occupation (even though I think most people very much prefer Brezhnev and maybe even Stalin to King Leopold of Belgium), but there was at least some kind of organized society.<p>The difference between the colonial powers leaving Africa and the Soviet Union leaving Eastern Europe was that the Soviet Union didn&#x27;t take with them everyone that worked in any kind of administration and most people who could read when they left. In Poland the guys that was in charge of the  central mail administration didn&#x27;t flee the country. The Department of Transportation didn&#x27;t burn all their archives and jumped on the first ship out of the country. That was what happened in most of Africa. Almost all the people who had been in charge and had any knowledge fled. That didn&#x27;t happen in Eastern Europe in nearly the same degree.",1379271613

Instead of arguing philosophy about the causes of gender imbalance, we can decide that what we&#x27;re actually worried about are concrete people who should get a chance to do what they&#x27;re good at, and concrete cases of poor behavior that prevent that.<p>We can stop arguing about this issue, and go out and mentor kids who are interested in what we do, and create communities where abuse and low expectations are inappropriate regardless of who they&#x27;re directed at, and make the world a better place. And that strategy will work regardless of which theory is right! Craziness.<p>Let&#x27;s go do it.",1379271603

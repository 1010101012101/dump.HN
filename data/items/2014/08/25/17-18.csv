I&#x27;ve seen &quot;she&quot; used for ships and the like as well, though I&#x27;ve always found that a little sexist myself, as if it were equating women with inanimate objects. In the end I don&#x27;t care much either, I was just wondering, since I have seen some more recent articles and publications move towards using &quot;she&quot; as a generic pronoun, but I&#x27;ve always attributed that to the influence from modern feminist movements.<p>My personal preference is for singular &quot;they&quot;, for what it&#x27;s worth.",1408989592

8222966,comment,8222497,8222855,13,0,DannyBee,,,"(Gonna try to do the best I can here using only info that&#x27;s been made public before)<p>&quot;While at Google, only one person cut my interview short. I thought it was weird because I had answered her question correctly. But apparently they often write off a candidate for not using the right terminology or some other picky constraint.&quot;<p>I see the other side of the interviews (i sit on a large number of Google hiring committees, and have for about 7 years), and I certainly don&#x27;t see this happen often.  Mostly among newer interviewers.  HC gives feedback when we see it, and that puts a stop to it.  We either ignore or adjust our thoughts on the interview score to account for it.<p>Without knowing your exact case, i&#x27;ll point out there is rarely a &quot;correct&quot; answer to the interview question.  It&#x27;s usually more about thought process and whether you can reason about how to improve upon solutions, etc.  Hiring committees hate interview questions that rely on tricks or whatever in order to get good solution, and usually either ban the questions or at the very least, ask interviewers to change questions (and again, adjust our thinking to ignore or whatever the interview score)[1]<p>Hiring Committees certainly try to make sense of interviews, and we are, after all, people.  It&#x27;s not like we look at interview scores, go &quot;welp, they are 0.1 points below the average hiring score, so that&#x27;s a no&quot;.  We are also very good about spotting inconsistencies between interviews, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not going to claim it&#x27;s perfect, but it&#x27;s definitely not what reddit claims, where \n&quot;They look at it for 3-5 minutes and decide whether you are hired or not. In exceptional cases, they decided that they don’t have enough information, and ask you to do more interviews. &quot;<p>I spend a large number of hours a week at night reading candidate interview packets, writing up what i thought of each interview and how it affected my thoughts on hiring the candidate, etc.  I then spend an hour in each committee discussing candidates.<p>It may be that <i>in committee</i>, it takes 3-5 minutes to make a decision, but that is because committees tend to end up with very consistent decisions between members (and we don&#x27;t see each others initial decision or reasoning until the meeting starts).  If the decision from everyone was &quot;no, we shouldn&#x27;t hire&quot;, or &quot;yes, we should hire&quot;, then there is nothing really to discuss.<p>If there is dissent one way or the other, long discussions over candidates often break out, and we keep going till we come to a consensus about hiring or not hiring.  \nUsually we don&#x27;t need to ask for more interviews, there are rare cases where we just don&#x27;t have enough signal in the interviews.<p>[1]\nI believe it was Rob Pike who said that it is very easy to come up with questions where if the person does badly, you don&#x27;t want to hire them, but very hard to come up with questions where if they do well, you do want to hire them.  Questions that have &quot;tricks&quot; in them basically never fall into the latter category.",1408989450

Vancouver has stuff going on but it&#x27;s rainier and occasionally gets cold. For a few days each winter, it will drop below zero and in most years there is a dusting of snow although it doesn&#x27;t last long. Schedule this period (basically January) as vacation time.<p>Of greater concern is that Vancouver is expensive and rental accommodations are subpar. Forget about buying a house unless you are rich. The transit infrastructure is mediocre and the city is plagued by terrible architecture and a general blandness. This is offset by the tremendous potential for outdoors fun: skiing, sailing, rock climbing (in nearby Squamish), etc.",1408989425

English, for example, has over a million words, while French and Italian are both under 100K. That 10x discrepancy in words means that there is necessarily far more imprecision in romance languages than English. Graamatical constructs can add precision and clarity but cannot make up for the inherent gap in vocabulary precision.<p>Someone with more knowledge can comment on the feasibility of precise NLP in non-English, non-romance languages.<p>If, however, acceptance testing is defined through the precision of a low-level programming language, but the problem is defined in a less-precise natural language, there will always be a precision mismatch between the languages used to define the problem.

First, you should absolutely edit this to change the name and gender pronouns, you are clearly misgendering this person. Secondly, being trans isn&#x27;t about gender association, it is expressing and living as your gender, period. &#x27;Gender association&#x27; implies that there is some true gender rather than what Chelsea Manning has stated and that is very transphobic whether you realize it or not.<p>> What&#x27;s considered the current best way to describe this, that Bradley Manning released the documents (past tense) and now Chelsea Manning needs support (present tense), or that Chelsea Manning released documents and now needs support?<p>The latter. Chelsea Manning released these documents and now needs support. If you are speaking to specific historical information, sometimes you may need to refer to the previous name. However, it is rare to need to phrase something this way and usually such phrasings serve to portray being trans in a negative light.<p>> The first way feels like it&#x27;s more useful for expressing the situation to those that lived through it, but may be ignoring the identity of the person in question. Referring to the person through the later moniker in all instances may be confusing to those that miss the change as it happens, but may be less confusing to future generations.<p>It is not confusing whatsoever. People change names and aliases all the time for a variety of reasons but the world doesn&#x27;t end and future generations aren&#x27;t confused as to who someone is. Moreover, misgendering someone isn&#x27;t just ignoring their identity, it is a slap in the face and challenges the validity of their existence.",1408988783

Chelsea Manning has clearly stated that she is a woman and should be referred to as a woman.<p>> I ask because I&#x27;m torn between wanting to respect the individual, but also as a computer scientist feeling somewhat offended that someone&#x27;s later choice of how they want to refer to themselves caused altered accounts of historical information, which to my eyes is more confusing (and possibly less accurate, if that confusion isn&#x27;t addressed promptly and often).<p>If you say you are feeling torn, then you are not wanting to respect this person at all, so you really aren&#x27;t feeling torn. Bottom line, Chelsea Manning is a woman and should be referred to as such. You say you are offended, but what you are really saying is that you feel that you know her gender better than she does. You don&#x27;t. Your discomfort with trans folks is your own issue and to misgender someone is hugely disrespectful.<p>> I&#x27;m not really sure how to square that with myself, but I think I lean towards preserving the data integrity of the public record. If someone referred to themselves in a specific way and identified themselves a specific way in the past, I think that&#x27;s how they should be referred to when discussing that point in time.<p>There is a difference between talking about past events and continuing to insist on misgendering someone in the present.",1408988392

That’s the result of many thousands of years of evolution, and it’s actually very efficient. If we had to be always explicit, our phrases and sentences would be much, much longer — and boring. When A says something to B, A makes assumptions on B’s context, common sense,beliefs and knowledge. The verbal message itself just contains the minimum information needed, on top of this pre existing information, in order for B to get it.<p>Natural Language can be seen as a very efficient compression algorithm. The phrase the speaker chooses is the shortest message, given the context of the receiver.<p>Programming a computer with Natural Language is incredibly difficult, because Natural Language alone, without the context it is built upon, really lacks much of the information the computer needs to operate the program.",1408986346

The order would use existing legal authority to compel Jawbone to provide real-time data on the user’s precise geographical location and whether he or she is awake. Obviously if the target is at home and awake, the Feds would abort the black bag job.<p>The Google Play store listing shows that the Up app wants access to precise (GPS) and approximate (network) location, so the lat/long available for NSA perusal with compulsory process is likely pretty detailed. And the marketing literature on the Jawbone site uses “always-connected” and “real-time” language, which is perfect if you&#x27;re in the real-time surveillance business.<p>The non-U.S. user targeted by FedGov may think he’s escaping surveillance because he’s using only local phone providers and local email providers. He’d be wrong; Jawbone is based in SF and subject to U.S. law… Another interesting use would be tracking physical movements of non-U.S. users and correlating them to see who’s meeting with whom; does Jawbone force SSL for its API usage? (The API web page only says “communication should be done over a secure channel,” not “must.”)<p>I’m joking above, of course, and I have no reason to believe the NSA has done this for a non-U.S. citizen or the FBI has for domestic surveillance. My point is to suggest that folks here at startups think in advance about how to respond to legal process, how to encrypt data in transit, and how to store user data in a way that minimizes your legal exposure and protects your users’ privacy.<p>Better to think about this early vs. after you get an early morning knock on the door with a very serious plainclothes guy with a badge serving you with some very serious papers demanding info.

10058065,comment,10050655,10056717,0,0,mikekchar,,,"If you are interested in the subject a very popular set of hypotheses at the moment come from Stephen Krashen of the university of California.  He has helpfully put his book online: <a href=""http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practi...</a><p>I will say that, like many studies in psychology, I find his research to be less than rigorously tested.  I think it is reasonable to keep a skeptical eye, but even if the work is guided by intuition, it appears to be very good intuition.<p>Very quickly.  There are 5 main hypotheses:<p>- Acquisition-Learning distinction hypothesis that states that language acquisition (ability to use the language freely without undue conscious thought) is different than learning (being able to remember facts about the language).  Acquisition is required for fluency.<p>- Natural Order hypothesis states that grammar constructs in language are acquired in a certain order, no matter what order you teach the material. This has actually been show in studies and verified independently.  Of the 5 hypotheses, I think this is the most rigorously tested.  Somebody actually proposed the natural order for English grammar, but I can&#x27;t find the link.  It is (surprisingly) not very important what it is (see below)<p>- Monitor hypothesis states that there is a process in your brain which essentially scans language input and output and states whether it parses or not.  For example, &quot;Harold and me are going to the store&quot;, <i>sounds</i> wrong even if you don&#x27;t know that &quot;me&quot; should be used as an object of the sentence, but is instead being used as a subject.<p>- Input hypothesis (the most important, but also most controversial hypothesis).  Acquisition results largely/only from being exposed to input that you understand (input being language that you hear or read).  In other words, in order to acquire language, it is sufficient to expose yourself to language that you can understand (in any way -- it being explained, obvious from context, etc, etc).  Practice with output (speaking, writing) is not necessary (though, personally I think it may be helpful in some circumstances -- certainly helpful just from the acquisition of the physical skill of forming the sounds).<p>- Affective filter hypothesis states that language acquisition is hampered (and perhaps halted altogether) in situations of stress.  Language acquisition occurs when the person is in a relaxed environment, without any pressure to achieve anything in particular (obviously a big problem for classrooms if true).<p>There is one other corollary which is quite important, known as &quot;i + 1&quot;.  It states that when language acquisition occurs, if your current ability is &quot;i&quot;, then you will automatically acquire &quot;i + 1&quot; along the lines of the natural order hypothesis.  As long as you are exposed to the material in a way that allows you to understands what it means (again, though context, explanation, etc) you will naturally acquire the next bit that you need.  There is no need to teach to the natural order (and in fact Krashen suggests that it is counter productive because you limit what the students are exposed to).<p>So the upshot is that you simply have to expose yourself to language that you can understand and you will acquire language.  There is no need (and it may be counter productive) to limit the types of grammar that you are exposed to because you will automatically acquire the next bit that you need in the natural order as long as you are exposed to it.  Limiting the types of grammar you are exposed to will only slow you down.  Learning (as opposed to acquisition) is not necessary, but can be helpful in strengthening your monitor (which is good for providing feedback).  However, Krashen warns that too much reliance on the monitor (as is common in classroom teaching) will not lead to acquisition.<p>I would add a few personal observations.  My experience is that these hypotheses largely fit what happened in my classroom and in my own study of Japanese.  Krashen does not talk extensively about the role of memory in acquisition, nor does he talk about the need for repeating exposure to certain input.  I think he is probably right that it is unnecessary to consider this, but my experience is that memory helps to speed the process by allowing you to understand more input.<p>This is why I suggest memorizing the meanings of sentences.  If you do so, you will have more context for trying to understand new input.  It&#x27;s not really important for acquisition, per se, but it gives you a super fast look up table of examples so that you can understand more new input.  Especially when coupled with reading (where you can progress at any speed that you like), this has dramatically improved the pace with which I could learn Japanese.  It really appeared to help my students as well.<p>There are probably lots of study techniques that would work according to these hypotheses.  Even the &quot;study lots of grammar&quot; technique is not at all bad if it is coupled with &quot;read a lot of books and struggle through comprehending the sentences using the grammar rules you learned&quot;.  The problem is that most teachers couple grammar memorization with language <i>output</i>, leading to students who know lots about a language, but if they acquire anything it is a kind of baby language of non-idiomatic phrases that they invent themselves (like... programmers... ahem...)<p>One other very important thing to realize is that there is not anywhere enough time to get the repetition necessary to acquire large proficiency in a language in the classroom.  It <i>must</i> be self study!!!  Again, this is where most people (and especially teachers) get it wrong.  Even when I ask teachers, &quot;How did you become fluent in X?&quot;, they <i>never</i> reply &quot;at school&quot;.  And yet, they still believe they can teach people to become fluent in a language at school.<p>Just as a caveat, there <i>are</i> some classroom techniques evolving which seriously limit the scope of language in order to teach fluency of a small subset in the classroom.  This can work very, very well if you are simply teaching the students how to continue on in their own study once they gain confidence in their ability to become fluent in a small subsection of the language.  Unfortunately, the hubris of teachers (like programmers) is largely unbounded and for some reason they think they can go beyond this role...<p>Hope you found this interesting.  I really should put this content somewhere semi-permanent.  I seem to type the same thing every few month ;-)",1439513504

Internet has enabled us to do so especially in the developing countries (this is where most of the luxury goods are made).<p>Today we are taking the first step towards our goal and launching our transparency project. We believe you have the right to know where and under what conditions your products are made and who is making them. We believe no one wants to wear a pair of shoes/clothing made by a child or a pregnant women under abusive conditions. Even though our craftsmen have been making European shoes for decades, it’s only now that we are able to connect them directly to the end customer.<p>So what transparency are we bringing to our own company? For every order or a pair of shoes, you’ll know about the craftsmen/women who made them. You’ll receive step-by-step details about the work in progress through email. This is our first step (in beta right now) in this direction and we&#x27;re experimenting this with some of our customers and the Kickstarter backers.<p>You can see the email screenshot here: <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0427/6309/files/Markhor-Transparency-Email.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0427/6309/files/Markhor-Tr...</a><p>Happy to answer any questions about our products or the transparency mission in general.<p>-SQ",1439512365

What I should have pointed out is that ongoing http requests to external endpoints will not block the afterSave from returning. As such, you can still use Mailchimp in this case without worrying that a client will be blocked. Of course, you will want to avoid blocking the afterSave on the third party network request (e.g. adding on to the promise chain), which should not be a problem if this is truly a fire-and-forget operation.&quot;<p>Honestly, this is part of the problem with Parse. It&#x27;s a big, black box where the documentation doesn&#x27;t _actually_ dig into the cases that are really important. For a big, black box the documentation really doesn&#x27;t step up to where it needs to be.<p>So some stuff blocks afterSave, and some stuff doesn&#x27;t. Does saving another object from afterSave block a save? What about the nested triggers on that other object? Why isn&#x27;t that documented anywhere?<p>- &quot;Adding Parse objects to pointer fields is documented in all of the guides. createWithoutData is an alternate constructor that can be useful when creating pointers explicitly, but it&#x27;s not the only way of creating a pointer. The link I posted is straight from the API Reference docs.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a reference to this, despite repeated Googling.<p>Open the JS developer&#x27;s guide. The doc for&quot;createWithData&quot; says that it creates a &quot;reference&quot; to to an object. OK, that&#x27;s a synonym for a pointer, well... sort of. Let&#x27;s look at the actual method example:<p><pre><code>  Creates a reference to a subclass of Parse.Object with the given id. This does not exist on Parse.Object, only on subclasses.\n\n  A shortcut for:\n\n   var Foo = Parse.Object.extend(&quot;Foo&quot;);\n   var pointerToFoo = new Foo();\n   pointerToFoo.id = &quot;myObjectId&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nSo, there&#x27;s no example of how this actually can be used to set a pointer value as a field. I&#x27;m expected to guess that this &quot;reference&quot; can be set to a field of type &quot;pointer&quot;. And apparently I can create a pointer just by creating a new object? What? Where&#x27;s that documented?<p>Instead we Google for &quot;parse set pointer&quot; and this page comes up:<p><a href=""https://www.parse.com/questions/javascript-api-set-and-create-pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.parse.com/questions/javascript-api-set-and-creat...</a><p>&quot;That format, {&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;Pointer&quot;,&quot;className&quot;:&quot;User&quot;,&quot;objectId&quot;:&quot;asdadsasd&quot;} is what is considered a Pointer object.

Plus the extension itself has the ability to download and run additional malware.<p>I saw a particularly nasty setup one time that a chrome extension downloaded a payload and ran it which would re enable/reinstall the chrome extension if it was removed, and the extension would reinstall the payload if it noticed it was missing. The only way out was to either wipe the chrome profile and machine, or be really quick and remove both of them at the same time.<p>It&#x27;s obviously not an ideal solution (to block all unsigned extensions), but but when the options are:<p>1.

There&#x27;s also not a way to ask for a route that doesn&#x27;t include a ferry (sometimes you can drive around). For example Google Maps suggests 1:04 to get to a spot on Bainbrdige for me right now where Waze says 25 minutes. Considering the ferry ride itself takes ~30 minutes...",1439510763

The latter is done out of love and not necessarily profit, which makes it more likely to be self-funded until it gets big.",1439510699

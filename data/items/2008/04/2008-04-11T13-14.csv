Even though knowledge is more and more accessible, the wisdom to use it will not be within the granting power of Man. [taken from various philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates and probably many more have glimpsed this trait of human nature]",1207922351

160991,comment,160923,160982,0,0,dhimes,,,"I'm not so convinced that Microsoft's business model is doomed.  Even with ubiquitous net access, there are still issues with keeping sensitive information on evil corp servers.  Not just legal (medical info, educational records, etc.), but also practical issues. After all, if you are a software company, you are competition for other software companies.  (This is what MS overlooked as Google was taking root.)  Putting your business strategy in their hands is not something I'm comfortable with.<p>I think MS's stranglehold will be loosened, however.  I am fine working with Open Office (I really like MS Publisher, however), Firefox, and other ""alternative"" apps.  I think others will be too, especially if the recession turns out to be very painful.<p>Imagine how much $ a school system would save if they went to Open Office?",1207922127

160987,comment,160923,160923,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I dislike Microsoft, but the idea that the only hope of MS is online advertising is scary. We're talking about 30 billion in sales for office and windows. Is the only viable alternative for MS to give up all that in order to chase advertising dollars? Will 'free' really kill an entire industry?",1207921720

160985,comment,160732,160964,0,0,dhimes,,,"I have an x_64 machine with an Atheros card (5007, I think).  Nobody can make this work yet to my knowledge (it works on i386).  Typically, it just takes a while for open source versions to come out for proprietary drivers.  Same (I'm hoping!) for my Epson R280 printer.<p>So it's not really weirdness that sets you back, as much as it is using linux-friendly stuff.  It's riskier to go with Linux.  Kinda like stick-shift vs. auto transmission:  Stick-shift is way more fun, but it takes more effort to learn and is inconvenient in heavy traffic when you are trying to do other stuff....",1207921389

160982,comment,160923,160923,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"As funny as this would be to watch, I think this underestimates the lock-in effect Microsoft has on business and everyday users. Even with Ubuntu, linux isn't going to capture the mainstream in a long time, so the only real threat to Windows on the desktop is OS X... and since you have to buy hardware to get it, Microsoft still has a pretty strong moat here.<p>Now if Apple were to give away their OS for non-mac hardware, that would be interesting.<p>As for Office, no online solution can compete until net access becomes ubiquitous. You can't use Google Apps on a plane at the moment, and a lot of users are comfortable with Word's UI.<p>I think Microsoft's business model is <i>eventually</i> doomed, but not in any time frame short enough to make the Yahoo deal matter in that regard.<p>It seems to me like Microsoft should leverage what it is very good at (marketing) and try to compete with IBM in the consulting business rather than try to compete online. There will always be a huge market of MBAs wasting money on overpriced tech advice!",1207921086

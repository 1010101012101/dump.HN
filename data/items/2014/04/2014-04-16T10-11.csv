7597021,comment,7594393,7594603,3,0,mike_hearn,,,"Breaking instant payments doesn&#x27;t make Bitcoin more secure, it just makes it less useful. The model generalises to probabilistic rewriting of the block chain, there&#x27;s nothing special about confirmed vs unconfirmed.<p>Bitcoin assumes the majority of hash power obeys the rules. At the moment, nobody knows how to build a system in which the majority of all players are dishonest and colluding against you, and Bitcoin is definitely not such a system. People who think it can be trivially evolved into such a system need a reality check: the more miners become dishonest and don&#x27;t play by the rules, the less useful Bitcoin becomes. It doesn&#x27;t take 51% to make it practically useless either.",1397645974

I am confused. SHA-512 is for hashing, but not the encryption.  The so-called &quot;RSA debacle&quot; does not stop you from using RSA as part of PGP, unless you are using the older (and maybe less useful; I am not a cryptograher) DSA options in PGP.  Care to elaborate?  Your jokes are cute, but that joke in particular scares me out of trying your service because it shows a biased or garbled technical story here.<p>Also, we appreciate the mention of the Pax kernel, but TrueCrypt on Linux.  Can you go into more detail?  I am intrigued why you would choose this over any other software-based full disk encryption system (LUKS+dm-crypt, for example).<p>Also, FDE of the email servers is nice, but as the sole owner of a bunch of accounts, you can still be compelled to hand that data over, and without hardware-based encryption (and people are more skeptical than ever about TPM chips due to recent news in play), I am not sure it helps.  The PGP is nice, but I think you are going to get a lot of snark and rightful skepticism on browser-based JS crypto, which is controversial.  I did not say impossible, but many people, me included, do not think this is ready for primetime (some think it never will be, I am staying out of that flamewar).<p>Nice site, so-so copyright, but there is no silver bullet in this arena and I would prefer your &quot;nerd info&quot; gives better technical detail and a real, real warning about promises you cannot keep.",1397645581

7596960,comment,7595098,7596571,17,0,pavelludiq,,,"As a lisper, I can say that this insight is very true, but it is still just a simplification. Most lisps deal with it in different ways.<p>In the scheme world, the way they deal with this is by wasting a decade on making decisions about the language that should have been done in the 80s. The result is that scheme essentially split into scheme and racket. Now we have an awesome language and a nice little ecosystem thats good for teaching and research, and possibly even real work(tm). Classic scheme unfortunately is fragmented into implementations who all do things slightly differently and occupy their own niches.<p>In the clojure world, they have a) a BDFL who sets the course of the language. b) A very strong core community of very smart people who managed to build a nice culture based on common ideas about software and design.<p>In the common lisp world, because we have a very high-quality standard, implementations are almost completely compatible. Compatibility libraries make it easy to write very portable code, avoiding the scheme problem. At the same time implementations are free to experiment. The other problem of everybody developing their own little universe tends to be rare. Because common lisp is so old, we have a long history and traditions that guide future design, but don&#x27;t constrict it. There is a subtle balance here. We have a lot of old examples to learn from, but we are not locked in by too many bad old decisions(not always the case, but good enough in practice).<p>A few examples where this does not work include utility libraries and things like json libraries, libraries for outputing html etc. Since we don&#x27;t have a BDFL we are left to figure things out amongst our selves and sometimes, like with utility libraries(there are dozens such, which is ridiculus) it doesn&#x27;t work. In other cases, it works very well, for example quicklisp, ASDF, bordeaux-threads, closer-mop, hunchentoot etc. are either de-facto standards, or sufficiently popular to be a very good default. As with clojure, there are a lot of common ideas about what is good design in the community, we have a lot of examples to learn from, as I mentioned.<p>In the end, at least in the case of common lisp and clojure, I see it as an advantage to have this &quot;level of possible diversity&quot;, it&#x27;s what has kept lisp alive for 50+ years! The fact that lisp can adopt to each new era of software development philosophy is a great reason to study it. It will be with us for many more decades because of this.",1397644614

Oh yeah, it was called the &quot;iPhone&quot;, you may have heard of it.<p>Tests for categories as seemingly refined as classical music performance -- both auditions of performers, and trials of classic vs. modern instruments, and fine wines, show that there are huge differences in non-blinded vs. blind trials (for music), and that wine experts are incredibly unreliable in how they grade, or even describe the qualities of, wines.

Considering that there is more than enough defined in the specification, what benefits would be in having an &quot;official&quot; hash litteral syntax?<p>Reader macros are powerful, no doubt. The benefit of building this into a language would mainly be syntactic regularity. CL as it stands has keyword args, alists, property lists, and real hash tables (probably amongst other things I don&#x27;t know about), that all fill basically the same purpose of mapping names to values. If the creators of Common Lisp and its parent lisps had started with hash tables with standard reader syntax, they probably wouldn&#x27;t have felt the need to introduce so many subtly different but conceptually identical concepts. Lua, for instance, uses its single table data structure both as syntax and as an internal representation for pretty much any case where it needs to map some names to some values; from keyword arguments to environments to &quot;metatables&quot; that provide fairly powerful metaprogramming support, they&#x27;re all just tables that you can write literally and use the same functions to manipulate. You could say that alists fill this purpose and are even more syntactically regular since they&#x27;re still sexps, but then why doesn&#x27;t CL use alists for keyword args, and why don&#x27;t Scheme&#x27;s keyword arg extensions use alist syntax? Historical accident, or are alists just ugly? If you can admit that they&#x27;re a little too ugly and verbose to include in function calls, then maybe you can see why I don&#x27;t like writing alist literals.<p>> The fact that you are mainly manipulating lists does not mean that everything is eventually represented as supposedly inefficient linked-list at runtime.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that a compiler can easily expand keyword arguments into regular ones. I strongly doubt your compiler will transform all the literal alists in your program into hash tables, and replace all the alist-ref functions and so on operating on them with the equivalent hash table functions. As long as alists are more syntactically blessed than hash tables, people will use them where another data structure would be more appropriate.",1397644192

Hard to see any other real reason for this than to make switching to another brand a little bit harder and to make a few extra $$$ by selling accessories.<p>So even if adding a new USB port for charging is cheap and easy, the manufacturers might still have reasons not to do it.",1397642775

What effect is this going to have on all the animals who will be affected by 24 hours of brightness year round?<p>From what I understand, the effect on on plants would be minimal, but what other processes on earth need the darkness? What would be the effect on dew rates, as I assume the sunlight would increase the heat of the earth and disrupt the heating and cooling effect of night.<p>So many questions I don&#x27;t even know to ask, but I am really uncomfortable with this idea.",1397642663

The fact that a programming language is a tool is not understood by all of us, and I personally admit that a very similar message I read on IRC opened my eyes when I was younger.<p>> <i>Would you have any problem if Dennis Ritchie identified himself as a C programmer or Matz as a Ruby programmer?</i><p>Your own example ruins your whole argument. Matz is a programmer, he invented Ruby and wrote its interpreter in C. Calling him a C programmer or a Ruby programmer makes therefore very little sense. Same goes for Dennis Ritchie and the assembly he used to create C.",1397642471

5089396,comment,5083175,5089041,2,0,robomartin,,,"Ah, Blade Runner. You are one of the good guys.<p>No, I didn't get angry (and no, I am not a Replicant).  It actually saddened me that what seemed like a useful conversation stopped dead-cold with such a personal comment.  As I said, I have devoted a lot of my life to image and color processing.  I guess it's part of the problem of being somewhat anonymous, something I am moving away from slowly.<p>Look, it's easy to come off as arrogant over email, newsgroups or similar means of communications.  Part of it is that sometimes people take it the wrong way when someone comes out in an authoritative manner.  I do.  However, I only do that when (a) I really, really know what the hell I am talking about and (b) I don't have the time to write twice as much text to cover all corner cases and be sure that everyone sees me as ""nice"".  I've heard talks by Linus where I've thought he came off as an arrogant asshole.  Then I slowed down and realized where he was coming from.  Once you understand that it all makes far more sense and, yes, it stops feeling arrogant.<p>I'm not 16 any more, so I don't really care about seeming ""nice"" online because, well, it's hard and it takes time. This, for me, isn't a popularity contest.  I'm simply, honestly, trying to share something and learn as well.  For example, I don't use Python that much at all.  Inspired by this thread I sat down and played with Python quite a bit.  That's a good outcome, at least for me anyway.<p>With regards to the idea of favoring green more than red and blue.  This isn't the intent of the equations.  This is actually what happens in the real world.  If you look at the spectral power distribution of a captured image you will see that, generally speaking, there's a lot more energy around the green portion of the spectrum.  I am over-simplifying and cutting corners here, but that's one way to think of it.<p>In other words, in normal images with normal lighting there's far more green stuff than red or blue.  And so, in converting an image to a grayscale representation you have to account for the fact that green contributes to the image twice as much as red and six times as much as the blue component.  If you don't apply these weights to the image you are going to be evaluating such things as noise and attributing far more value to image structures in the other channels.<p>Another generalization is that image noise is generally found in the blue channel far more prominently than the other channels. If you simply average all three channels you are effectively amplifying the blue channel.  Blue should have had a weight of about 10% and you are giving it 33%.  You have just tripled it's importance and, if there's any noise there you've just multiplied it by three.  When it comes to green, you are halving it's contribution from about 60% to 33%.  Here's the component that generally contributes the most information to an image and, by averaging it with the other colors, its contribution is now cut in half.  Finally, red is the component that suffers the least (almost not at all) from averaging.  Red contributes about 30% to an image; averaging amplifies it to 33%.<p>With regards to a blog.  Actually, I've been thinking about it.  Maybe later this year.  A blog feels far more ""serious"" than posting in places like HN.<p>Don't feel bad either.  Life is too short to get worked up about stuff that, in the grand scheme of things, matters not at all.",1358733521

5089377,comment,5089037,5089037,3,0,rdtsc,,,"It is also worth pointing out first there are various flavors. There is a range of type strengths. Maybe from something like Haskell down to, I don't know, Javascript with stuff like [1,10,4,21].sort() = [1,10,21,4].<p>There is strong typing vs weak typing as well, and either can appear in a dynamic language. There also allowing nulls and also having or not having algebraic types.<p>> That's part of a more general preference, for preserving information. When I'm programming, I know what kind of thing I expect in a parameter, and I know what I expect to return.<p>Doesn't a functional single assignment language like Clojure or Erlang then make most sense? If your goal is to preserve information and knowing that no funny business has been happening behind your back (when you are not ""figuratively"" looking) isn't that what you want? This is even more important if this is a concurrent program.<p>You also have to ask yourself, what is the overall goal here.

Or it helps the compiler to make faster code (v8 might disagree though).<p>Most people would perhaps arrive at -- ""I want my program to not crash as often"". One way to do it is to then have a provable correct program. For avionics there is some degree of that. But it is very expensive.

</code></pre>
As someone in the biotech space, this is by far the biggest factor. When you are dealing with humans, crashes and bugs mean deaths. Deaths mean increased regulation, often under the mistaken assumption that more rules would prevent engineers from making bugs. Modern testing and build systems might, but regulators aren't keen to change their testing systems, many of which were encoded by legislation decades ago. For example, adaptive clinical trials have been known to be theoretically superior to the Phase I/II/III design for 15 years, yet are still in limbo[1] at the FDA; their proponents are still banned from trying them out. Facebook does not need a Federal Software Assocation to sign off on its new unit testing framework.<p>Moreover, it is just more stressful to deal with a regulatory climate where any error is assumed to have happened because you were an evil corner-cutting capitalist who didn't allocate enough for safety. This kind of Monday morning quarterbacking is unfortunately usually done by people who've never shipped a drug or device in their lives, like most politicians, journalists, or federal regulators. Twitter, unlike Genzyme[2], is not fined millions of dollars by the FDA when its site is down.<p>Finally, you have to guess what the law is. There is so much ""discretion"" [3,4] afforded to regulatory agencies that the threat of fines and seizures over bizarre interpretations of the law by a Carmen Ortiz-style ambitious regulator is never far from your mind. Example [5]:<p><pre><code>  [Newsweek:] What exactly would constitute a medical   
  claim? Would pointing people to medical research papers 
  [qualify]?

  [FDA]: It depends. There are rules as to how one can do   
  that  Those rules are actually worked out pretty well, 
  and they just would need to make sure theyre staying 
  within the rules.

  [Newsweek:] Are those rules on the Web?

  [FDA]: I dont know where the policy is. I would have to 
  get it for you. Its an agencywide policy. I would have to 
  find it for you. And it wont be that easy for people to 
  follow it
</code></pre>
Another example [6]:<p><pre><code>  The agency has urged hospitals to allow vendors to guide 
  them on security of sophisticated devices. But the vendors 
  sometimes tell hospitals that they cannot update FDA-
  approved systems, leaving those systems open to potential 
  attacks. In fact, the agency encourages such updates.

  A lot of people are very confused about FDAs position on 
  this, said John Murray Jr., a software compliance expert 
  at the agency.
</code></pre>
And one more [7]:<p><pre><code>  In United States v. Park, the Supreme Court held that a 
  responsible corporate official can be convicted of a 
  misdemeanor based on his or her position of responsibility 
  and authority to prevent and correct violations of the 
  Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Thus, evidence that an 
  individual participated in the alleged violations or even 
  had knowledge of them is not necessary.  
</code></pre>
Think about that: criminal penalties for violations of laws that ""won't be that easy for people to follow"", where knowledge or participation in the alleged violations is not necessary. And the law is not static. The FDA also can and does write ""guidances"" outside of the legislative process which will make your business model illegal overnight or vastly more expensive due to unanticipated regulatory costs. Google does not need to guess what the DNS protocol is or will be in 2013.<p>For just a taste of how all this plays out, look at the FDA's ongoing attempt to regulate[8] mobile health apps. Who knows what the rules will be, what they will cost, or what the fines are? Look at the FDA's attempt to deny[5] people access to their genome without a prescription. Look at the fact that they issued a record 10000+ 483s in 2011[9], which threaten a business with civil or criminal penalties. Look at the fact that they used these 483s to shut down Teva and Sandoz and Hospira and Bedford at the same time[10], causing a massive shortage of injectables which they blamed on industry profit seeking and used to gain[11] yet more regulation, more power, more budget.<p>Look, finally, how they claim in an official court filing against family farms producing raw milk that you have ""No Generalized Right to Bodily and Physical Health"" [12], where they approvingly cite the case of Cowan vs. US, where a terminal cancer patient was denied access to experimental medication, denied the right to opt-out of the FDA:<p><pre><code>  There is No Generalized Right to Bodily and Physical   
  Health.

  Plaintiffs assertion of a fundamental right to their own 
  bodily and physical health, which includes what foods they 
  do and do not choose to consume for themselves and their 
  families is similarly unavailing because plaintiffs do 
  not have a fundamental right to obtain any food they wish. 
  In addition, courts have consistently refused to 
  extrapolate a generalized right to bodily and physical 
  health from the Supreme Courts narrow substantive due 
  process precedents regarding abortion, intimate relations, 
  and the refusal of lifesaving medical treatment. 

  See Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (warning that the fact 
  [t]hat many of the rights and liberties protected by the 
  Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy does not 
  warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all 
  important, intimate, and personal decisions are so 
  protected); see also Cowan v. United States, 5 F. Supp. 
  2d 1235, 1242 (N.D. Okla. 1998) (rejecting a claim that 
  the plaintiff had the fundamental right to take whatever 
  treatment he wishes due to his terminal condition 
  regardless of whether the FDA approves the treatment).
</code></pre>
I know it sounds surreal, but they are arguing here that you only control your own body with respect to abortion, intimate relations, and euthanasia. Everything else is controlled by the FDA, yea even unto your death from cancer.<p>The only solution here is for hackers to carve out a jurisdiction in which the FDA has no say, where patients are free to be early adopters and startups are free to push the technological envelope. Patients in this zone will need to be mature and understand that these are version 1.0s, and may not help or even actually harm them. But every drug or device or surgery needs <i>someone</i> to be first, and a few brave risk takers could both benefit their own health and push humanity forward. After all, we have thousands of people dying for <i>futile</i> risks in various foreign wars.<p>So, the limiting reagent is not money, or expertise, or motivation, or smarts. raganwald, you and most of HN are plenty smart enough. It's about the freedom for companies to innovate, for patients to take risks. We need a jurisdiction (a seastead? Singapore? Estonia?) that enables us to push the technological frontier.

So having Elixir around is helping Erlang team, kind of like many see Scala and Clojure as a way to make the Java ecosystem appealing and exciting again.",1358732346

The standard does not guarantee how it behaves but forces compilers to make a choice and to stick to it.<p>A different example, of a behavior that is really undefined, would be signed arithmetic overflow:<p>int detect_max(int x)

If there's a brief network interruption or the NFS server goes down, it's WAY safer to cause applications to hang until the server comes back.  Since NFS is a stateless protocol, when the server comes back, I/O resumes as if nothing ever happened.  This helps make using NFS feel more like using a local filesystem.

You had to be at least literate, and you had to spend the time to overcome the significant usability hurdle that even Mac OS X presents to the random person. (Eg: your grandmother.)<p>iOS has revolutionized computer usability such that your grandmother can use it, even if she never made it to high school (bless her heart.)<p>The second is price/distribution. PCs were for the relatively rich. And while Apple never <i>seemed</i> to compete on the lowest end, that's simply because most people who think Apple makes expensive products think about $300 laptop as ""affordable"".  Instead, Apple put a $50 computer in peoples hands- the iPod shuffle.  Sure, it might not be as full featured as a laptop, but you have to walk before you can run.<p>Lets also not forget that there's a big difference between a PC that draws serious amps and thus needs a house wired for electricity... and a mobile that runs on batteries and can be charged with solar power.<p>Apple is toiling away building the greatest development/ design/ manufacturing/ distribution machine in history.  Of course they have some key partners in this- foxconn and their suppliers.<p>That iPod shuffle has been replaced with the inexpensive iPod touch, which really is a PC.  And of course there is the iPad mini, also a new entry on the low end pc market.<p>Just because they didn't choose to make zero margin crap that nobody can use (Eg: windows running netbooks), doesn't mean they aren't working their tails off to address this under filled market.  They are coming in from the high end, which makes sense given that they can't make the devices fast enough. Hence scaling the company across all those axis I mentioned.<p>I'm sure this sounds like a radical idea, because ""everyone knows"" that Apple is only interested in selling ""shiny things to rich people"".

Five years ago I would do things like cast function pointers to void-pointer and back, or calculate addresses that were outside the bounds of any allocated object and compare against them, all without really even realizing I was doing something wrong.<p>I don't think this will spell doom-and-gloom for C and C++ though.  I think a few things will happen.<p>First of all, the compiler people are walking a fine line; yes, they are breaking code that relies on undefined behavior, but they often avoid breaking too much.  For example, I've had it explained to me that at least for the time being, gcc's LTO avoids breaking any programs that would work when compiled with a traditional linker.  In addition, they often provide switches that preserve traditional semantics for non-compliant code that needs it (like -fno-strict-aliasing and -fwrapv).<p>Secondly, I believe that tooling will get better, and rather than ignoring the warnings I believe that people's general awareness of this issue will raise, as well as knowledge of standard-compliant ways of working around common patterns of undefined behavior.  For example, it's often easy to avoid aliasing problems by using memcpy(), and this can usually be optimized away.<p>Thirdly, I expect that the standard may begin to define some of this behavior.  For example, I think that non-twos-complement systems are exceedingly rare these days; I wouldn't be surprised if a future version of the standard defines unsigned->signed conversions accordingly.",1358730651

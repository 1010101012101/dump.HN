8256136,comment,8249052,8256118,1,0,jspiros,,,"Very cool.<p>I wrote up a spec very similar to this (though I just used the hash itself for the folders, as in HA/HAS/HASH structure [there&#x27;s probably a name for that scheme]), but haven&#x27;t gotten around to implementing it. My main problem with actually implementing such a system is that I don&#x27;t really like depending on Django or web-based interfaces; I&#x27;m a huge fan of files, and UNIX-style tools that operate on them, I just don&#x27;t like the hierarchical filesystem. I&#x27;ve considered that a FUSE frontend to such a system would probably address most of my concerns, but at that point it&#x27;s still a big huge abstraction layer that I start to feel uncomfortable for nebulous reasons aside.<p>But, very nice. It&#x27;s nice to hear that I&#x27;m not the only person driven to such extremes. :)",1409641195

I think we can all agree that those suffered from misguided engineering choices (bloaty XML culture).<p>Responsive images could have been an XHTML module with a javascript implementation. The browser vendors could catch up and provide native implementations in their own time, but that would not postpone immediate usage.<p>If it were done right, anyone could have defined a markup module/schema with parsing rules and scripting. The evolution of those extensions would have been pretty damned fast due to forking, quick vetting/optimization, etc. It would have been well timed with the recent javascript renaissance, if it had happened. It might have meant browser vendor independence at the level of the developer.<p>HTML should really have been modular with an efficient, lightweight core spec. It should have also paid lots of attention to being semantic so that others could compete with Google on search. I am still curious if that&#x27;s why Google got involved in the WHATWG. I&#x27;m rambling about things I don&#x27;t know about though...",1409641194

8256126,comment,8253110,8253110,1,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"I&#x27;ve seen Tox before and looked into it. Think I&#x27;ve commented on it before, but maybe not, so here&#x27;s my take: Nice sentiment. Doesn&#x27;t yet quite live up to what it wants to be. But if the project can listen and adapt to advice like this, it has scope to improve and be a really important contender.<p>Firstly, it <i>needs</i> metadata protection with onion (or, better, garlic) routing. Without that, it still has a pretty big mass-analysis flaw. Please look at I2P for an example of the kind of architecture that would work well: two DHTs with decoupled garlic routing in between? You may, or may not, leverage an existing network for that; there are some obvious cover-traffic advantages if you do, but it&#x27;s less synergistic.<p>Secondly, I don&#x27;t see a full forward-secure messaging ratchet in there, it&#x27;s really per-session. Look into Axolotl, and in particular what TextSecure v2 aka Signal has done for group chats too. Tox - using libsodium - already has every tool it needs to do that, it just doesn&#x27;t do it fully yet.<p>Thirdly, more stability. The susceptibility of the DHTs to resource-starvation attacks. (I don&#x27;t think I2P ever actually implemented the hashcash it planned for?) But there&#x27;s been some further work on that. Scalability is tricky, especially in the face of on-path attackers...<p>Skype is pretty awful. It&#x27;s actually pretty much centralised now, using TLS, but still runs much like the bad P2P network it used to be: closed-source software with a bad reputation for eating 100% CPU and awful chat desync. Most people who use it would rather be using something better, and I think there&#x27;s plenty of scope there - people <i>would</i> switch if there <i>was</i> something better. Let&#x27;s make sure an alternative is <i>much</i> better?<p>Oh, maybe look into a distributed consensus protocol of some form for name registration - <i>if</i> it&#x27;s possible to do a light one which can impose ordering...<p>I&#x27;ve not performed a full security review. It&#x27;s too young for that, and it&#x27;s too young to rely on. When the above are addressed, then it&#x27;s time to give it a more thorough look. /akr",1409640828

For example, the product I work on is a pair of smart glasses with a computer inside.  The idea is not unique, it&#x27;s our innovations in engineering and manufacturing that let us make our product much smaller and more stylish than competitors.  Our creativity is applied in solving these technical and manufacturing problems.<p>To make a metaphor with cofounders at a software startup:  right now, the USA buying from China is like the USA is an &quot;idea guy&quot; / &quot;business guy&quot; who has an idea and access to capital, but no ability to implement the tech, and China is like an outsourced coder.  But this duo is a little disfunctional, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be either one of those characters.  I&#x27;d much rather be the best of both worlds: a smart and creative technical founder who can have the ideas AND implement them.  That guy&#x27;s company will run circles around the other duo...  As an example, SpaceX, by having both the ideas (reusable rocket) AND owning the factory, SpaceX can make rockets much more cheaply than competitors who design in the USA but outsource e.g. the engine production (ULA Atlas V rocket uses Russian-built engines)",1409639426

It may have been true that passenger pigeons did not travel in large flocks when DeSoto was exploring the Mississippi in the 16th Century, but events between then and the extinction of the species may have altered their behavior.<p>However, if the species is brought back, there is always the chance their behavior may change again (as it may have before) and large flocks may not be a requirement for their survival anymore.

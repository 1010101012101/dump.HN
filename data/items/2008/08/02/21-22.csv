Having control over the experience makes it more fun as well as having good teachers.<p>It just seems that these days most parents consider going to school a requirement and it's no wonder kids don't like doing it.<p>At the same time, various personality traits can overcome these. Someone will like learning no matter what and others may not like learning no matter what but for the most part I think it's due to the perception of learning being a chore.",1217714264

Then, you can just use a custom rewrite rule to transform subdomain.domain.tld into www.domain.tld/sub/subdomain or something similar.

265224,comment,264943,265058,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I think it is great for junior developers to read</i><p>I don't think so. In my observation, the primary effect of <i>Design Patterns</i> was to popularize a way of thinking (programming as the stringing-together of predefined constructs) that led a lot of people to write hyper-patterny bad code. This stuff, with its layers of tangled pseudo-abstraction, turned out to be harder to read, work with, and clean up than the plain old bad code they were writing before. But it felt sophisticated to the ones producing it, and they thought they were doing things the ""right"" way. Of course it's not the authors' fault how others used their book. But as Tim Lister cleverly said (about something else), ""if everybody gets it wrong there must be something wrong with <i>it</i>."" And I do think there was something misleading about the model the book promoted.<p>For example, the GoF ""patterns"" are not at all the same kind of thing, something that the technical format of the book obscured. Some (Decorator) are so simple and ubiquitous that calling them a pattern is silly (like talking about a ""parameter"" pattern). Others (Iterator) are true formalisms which, as has been pointed out many times, can and should be dealt with at a language level (for the same reason we don't have a ""subroutine"" pattern). Others (Interpreter) are so general that talking about them as patterns, let alone trying to create a canonical implementation of them, is pointless. Others (Abstract Factory) sound good at first, but are so different every time that they can't be effectively reasoned about (and god, did people make a mess with those). But <i>Design Patterns</i> promoted the idea that this was a collection of similar mechanisms, like tools in a toolbox, or a collection of standardized parts that the programmer would recognize the need for and plug in where appropriate. It sounded good, and came in a pseudo-technical encoding which was the real genius of the book from a sales point of view. But in my observation the whole approach broke down rather quickly in practice.<p>(Edited in a feeble attempt to make shorter.)",1217713289

As you start to make money the sole proprietor model is less favorable after taxes than a Sub-S corporation. As you start to make a lot of money and may have found a niche that would benefit from further investment converting the Sub-S to a C (or regular) corporation gives you a vehicle to grow the business further.",1217713234

265210,comment,265117,265117,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Whichever way you do it, you'll need to hook into your domain's master DNS servers. Maybe your DNS server operator has an API (or you need to find one who does), or you run your own DNS server and do it yourself. Operating DNS servers isn't rocket science, and reloading/refreshing the name database is generally a pretty well-supported feature.<p>If you're letting users point their subdomain at their own IP address or server, you'll probably want to set a relatively low TTL - most dynamic DNS services use 15 minutes - although you should be aware that this will increase the load on your DNS server. If it's just a matter of creating subdomains that point at <i>your</i> servers and dispatching on virtual hosts, you can safely use more usual TTL values.",1217711844

Assuming that your interest is compounded annually, just say that (1+x)^10 = 2 and solve for x. Or, to get an estimate, you know 72/7.2 = 10 so the interest rate needed is ~7.2%",1217711810

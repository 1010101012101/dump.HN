If you are competent and working at a high level in your field, certs not only don't mean anything, they're a negative signal.<p>However, if you've banged around in dead-end entry level jobs till you're 40, didn't go to uni, and are desperate to break the $40k/yr barrier because you've racked up a history of ex-wives and expensive child support payments and spending yet another 5 years renting the room above your now elderly parent's garage...they can mean the difference between $20/hr and a proper full-time job with benefits and an actual real salary.<p>At those kinds of employment levels, and for those kinds of employers, we're not talking about staffers or employers who are passionate about their IT systems or development staff.<p>At those levels IT is a cost center, barely tolerated but necessary. Think ""IT guy for a department store"". Managed at corporate by somebody who made a name for themselves by being the top floor salesperson of ties and suspenders and who told his manager one day in passing that he can copy CDs to mp3 files and is therefore qualified to run the regional IT systems.<p>Both the employees and the employers in these situations simply have entirely different life priorities than most of the folks here. To these folks the certs are extremely valuable, perhaps a 20-30% pay bump on both sides.<p>To the corporate IT manager he gets to tell <i>his</i> bosses that he has certified staff (and not part-time hobbyists he wrangled up from the Geek Squad when the local Best Buy closed up shop). This metric, at those levels of abstraction is important.<p>To the employee it's a big pay bump, and opens up lots of mediocre, but better paying jobs.<p>If you think of the IT world as analogous to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, the folks on this board are near the top, seeking Self-actualization, but the broader IT world is closer to the bottom of the pyramid and is therefore composed of many more people and positions in that pyramid.<p>Some folks are just simply destined to dwell in the lower levels of the pyramid, either by circumstance or poor life choices, and the cert <i>might</i> be just enough to move them up a level.",1341089902

I've worked in a pretty good lab full of grad students and their average skill level was dramatically higher than what you find at an average company (or at least, what I've seen working at half a dozen or so places), let alone what you see from average job applicants. Upon graduation most of these people easily found jobs at places like Google. They didn't get stumped on FizzBuzz because they had spent their time on abstract academic problems without real-world application.<p>There are definitely some people with CS degrees who cannot code, and you don't want to hire those people. The existence of these exceptions however doesn't mean that degrees aren't a strong positive signal when you are looking to hire somebody competent.<p>I think there's at least some reactionary bias against formal qualifications in the software industry and in startups.

The average tenure of an S&P 1500 company is something like 6.5 years. These companies generally have 20k-200k employees; I don't think anyone would argue that 6 years is long enough to create an environment where workers can create value in a firm of 200k employees. More like ""don't screw up the environment that worked when you got there"" in most cases. (Obviously turnarounds are different.)<p>There's another big problem with the theory that wealth is generally deserved because markets allocate it efficiently.

The assumption is, most files are passive data. When sharing a file, its tags should be sent along with it, so the receiving system can propose them by default to its user. Note that one may want to categorize tags themselves (meta-tags?).  I'm not sure, but it may be necessary if a given system use many tags.<p><i>Descriptive names</i>.  This is the user-facing name of the file.  No need for it to be unique.  Like tags, a file's descriptive name should be sent along with it.<p><i>Locations</i>.  It may be of import to know where a given file is physically located.  It is cool to transparently access more files when you plug you thumb drive in.  It is less cool to forget to actually copy those you need.<p><i>Unique keys</i>.  Devised by the system and not directly accessible by the user.  When a search yields several files with the same descriptive name, or when two files share tags and name and location, the system can be explicit about the ambiguity.<p><i>Unique names</i>.  Devised by the user.  The system checks uniqueness (or, more likely, uniqueness <i>by location</i>).  Follow a directory structure convention.  Discouraged by default.  Their primary usefulness would probably be for system and configuration files, which need to be accessed automatically and unambiguously by programs.  May be implemented on top of descriptive names (the system could treat descriptive names that begin with ""/"" as unique, and enforce that uniqueness).<p>There.  End users would primarily use tags, descriptive names, and locations.  With the right default, users may actually be able to avoid making a mess of their data.  To prevent unwanted access to sensitive system files, the system can by default exclude those files from search results.  Typically those both tagged ""system"", and located on the main drive.  Unique names would be for programs, power users, and those who want to fiddle with their system settings (either directly or through a friendly interface).

After 1 year of operation, the business generates $10,000 in profits. The business is taxed as a separate person, and has $6,500 left. With the $1,000 of initial capital, it's worth $7,500. Now, say one investor sells his shares for $7,500 / 10 = $750. How much richer is he? ($750 - $100) = $650. Now, say instead the company pays out all of its profits as a dividend. Each investor receives $6,500 / 10 = $650. The $100 of original investment will of course be recovered when he eventually sells his shares.<p>In each case, the investor is $650 richer than he was previously.

4182690,comment,4180915,4180915,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"As a developer I too a, disappointed by Twitter's move to restrict API access as it has but again, still as a developer, I can understand Twitter's point of view and I'll actually say what they're doing is smart and other sites should follow suit.<p>We all want our API access, we want it now, we want it free, and we want it unrestricted whether we monetize our use of another app's API or not. But unfortunately we can't just feed off Twitter's teet and expect them to just cater to our every want. API access is a privilege, not a right. By monetizing their API as they are they are avoiding the most common mistake that afflicts tech startups - the problem of monetization. They have their ""verified"" accounts and ""promoted tweets"" which is a good start and now that the API has become so valuable they are monetizing this. They're a company that offers a free service and making a true profit instead of just taking on VC money and hoping someone will figure out how they'll make money later. They did this at just the right time too. They are now an established player much like Facebook. Now that users are locked in and so many people are getting value from Twitter's quick information sharing and marketing capabilities they made a smart decision with this new monetization strategy.<p>We all should have known the free ride would end eventually. In many cases, apps using the API are actually competing with twitter itself! Surely you can't expect Twitter to allow competing apps like iOS and Android apps to outshine them. So these restrictions force those competing clients to actually innovate still! Yes, access to tweets are limited but apps like Hootsuite and others have found ways to use the API in other ways like scheduling tweets.<p>I'll definitely concede that I think their limits are a bit strict and they are pretty much only useful for hobby projects. At the same time, though, we've become spoiled and entitled and I can definitely understand the restrictions. Reactions to policies like this are to be expected. Everyone always throws a fit when these things happen but we'll live and we have to understand that Twitter needs money to run so they can provide an API at all and if we want to make a buck off Twitter's API we can't expect a free ride. That's like asking the owner of an office building to let you use office space free because... Well... It's there. That said, they need to be smart about this too. Too much restriction will hurt them but too little will mean they aren't generating what they need. But right now I don't think we can judge whether these policies are really that bad because, like I said, any time a service makes these changes everyone starts complaining and a lot of exaggeration goes on.",1341087247

It took some time to collect the better parts as my own money was very limited. I collected 2 computers and a lot of junk in my room. Anyone to beat it? (just kidding). I'm foreign born and my sex is ""F"".<p>I largely attribute the problem to the culture of competition and entitlement instilled today on kids by their parents (makes me feel old), especially boys and especially non-technical parents. It's like ""oh, my, he/she is so smart playing with THIS thing"". Then this kid goes to college and feels they need to challenge everybody, and feels intimidated when somebody is better. How can somebody else dare to have an A+ on a test and ask questions to the teacher? I will pop up and ask smarter questions for the sake of it. Or withdraw from this major because I don't feel belonging. I'm entitled to feel that I'm a great programmer. And so on. This culture doesn't teach to just diligently do your assignments/job and collect your A+s/money.

4182676,comment,4174435,4176168,1,0,malandrew,,,"I'll provide a counterpoint that doesn't involve America at all. When I lived in Beijing, I had a French friend of mine that lived in Shanghai and was responsible for all the sourcing of clothing for a high end French fashion label that had decided to move production to China. These are just two of many stories he told me:<p>(1) He signed a contract with a manufacturer. During the signing of the contract, the company intentially sealed the contract with a red stamp that looked official, but was not that companies legal red stamp. They did this so that if anything happened they would have an out if there were a dispute. A dispute eventually arose and my friend found out the hard way to always have those stamps double-checked to make sure they are legit and represent the business with whom they were doing business. Had my friend been literate in Chinese, he probably would have caught this, but the Chinese manufacturer intentionally exploited his illiteracy in Chinese to produce a contract that could not be enforced.<p>(2) On more than one occasion he would be called by a manufacturer to be informed that the clothes had been produced and were ready to be shipped and that all he had to do was deposit the rest of the money and they would ship the clothes.  After once discovering that the manufacturer had not even begun production, but was lying to him to cover a cash flow problem he made it a point of always flying out to the manufacture's plant the very next morning to personally inspect the entire shipment before depositing money in the account. After he started doing this, he repeatedly came across many manufacturers that were caught completely unprepared by his unannounced trip and when he arrived he discovered that no work had been done. This tactic to solve cash flow issues is apparently a semi-common occurrence.<p>Ask any foreign national that has ever worked (not just lived as a student) and you'll come across many many stories like the two above. I have my own stories from the times I taught public speaking to Phds in China.<p>TBH, I personally don't attribute it to race or nationality. It's just that many businesses in China have yet to move beyond a ""caveat emptor"" approach to business to a trust based system. A ""pareto optimality"" mindset prevails there. So many businesses transactions are negotiated on the Chinese side as ""A dollar they get in this is a dollar lost for me"" while the foreigners (depending on the country they are from, of course) are negotiating with the intention of long term continued business and that the long-term relationship will be far more profitable for both sides than trying to maximize short term returns. If there is any miscommunication, it's not because of language, but because the Chinese business is looking at it as a short term deal and the foreign side is looking at it as a long term relationship.<p>Just to be fair, most markets at one point in their development have been ""caveat emptor markets"". Europe and the US included. At some point a market eventually gets past that mindset once trust becomes a competitive advantage. In China, trust isn't yet seen as a competitive advantage because there are still many naive foreigners coming to China to manufacture things without knowing any better. Once the supply of naive business men going to China to manufacture stuff dries up, I reckon you'll see more competition based on trust.",1341086925

Without corporate form, a business owner is entitled to, by operation of law, the proceeds of his business, and is liable for, by the operation of law, the debts and other obligations of his business. That is the default scenario.<p>The corporate form comes along and says ""let's treat this business as a separate legal person."" The corporation, thus, is entitled to the proceeds of its business, and is liable for its debts and other obligations. The important thing to realize is that under this arrangement, the investor is not automatically entitled to a share of the corporation's profits. It's not his money, it's the corporation's money. The only thing the investor is entitled to is his capital contribution (which is not taxable), voting rights, and certain fiduciary duties from the corporate officers. When the corporation pays out a dividend, it's not giving the investor money he's entitled to by operation of law. It's a gratuitous transfer by one person (the corporation) to another. And it's taxed as such.<p>So it's not at all ""dishonest"" to say that the tax on capital gains is only 15%. It's a correct statement of the facts. It's no less correct than saying that your nanny's tax rate is 20% or whatever, even though she is paid with post-tax dollars. The corporate income tax isn't some gratuitous tax as the ""cost of limited liability."" It's just the natural consequence of structuring a business as a separate legal person in a system that taxes transactions between persons.",1341086412

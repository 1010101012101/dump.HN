I'll try and explain my feelings, but I might do a poor job of it.<p>Sure, professional sports players, chess players, etc. are <i>not</i> creating material wealth (I'll sidestep the hustler issues for now). The thing is, they are creating wealth by pg's definition, i.e. creating something people want (entertainment, in this case, that people can view).<p>Compare that with pro poker players. Ask most players what they want (who they want to play against), and they <i>won't</i> tell you that they want to play against a pro. I think pros make most of their money, ""preying"" on poor players who don't <i>realize</i> they're up against a pro. In that sense, pro players are not really creating wealth, they're tricking other people.<p>Of course, I'm completely ignoring a part of the poker world which <i>does</i> create wealth, i.e. the televised matches. These are obviously equal to spectator sports. Still, I think the majority of players who grind out a living playing against weaker players really <i>aren't</i> adding wealth to the world.<p>Hope that was clear.

1779136,comment,1777767,1779065,0,0,stuhacking,,,"This is also possible in common lisp, however, there seems to be a lot more use of looping in CL than other dialects... Perhaps for performance reasons.<p>Suppose, for example* , that `range' conses up a list of START to END numbers, then sums that list. That's a bunch of memory allocation then a reduction. It may be elegant, but looping over the numbers and accumulating the result would be faster and use less memory.<p>I'm no expert, but it seems that a lot of production common lisp code will have gone through a few cycles of optimisation and arrived at a point of resembling imperative procedures. As a result common lisp teaches iteration (skipping over the need to rediscover the production tricks) while scheme teaches recursion.<p>* That's not to say that this form couldn't be implemented in terms of looping.",1286784979

The answers will be very different if we're talking about death vs if we're talking about not being able to use electricity every Shabbat vs. being vulnerable to communication outages vs. mental health burnouts.<p>Basically I'm saying if you're asking the question, there's a scenario in play there, and the scenario can likely be planned for. Yes, Apple stock will take a diver when Steve Jobs dies or retires, but if there's a strategic plan in place for that exit, the chances of it bouncing back are <i>vastly</i> higher than if there is no plan.<p>Or put another way: The New York Times has his obituary written.

To me, programming is nothing like mathematical thinking, especially at an intro level. It&#x27;s more about giving super precise instructions to a stupid machine that has to be told every little thing.  There are lots and lots of successful, competent programmer who don&#x27;t know much math or logic as academic fields.<p>Edit; maybe a more relevant discussion would be talk about what is meant by &#x27;mathematical thinking&#x27;.",1392307195

7232011,comment,7231329,7231676,4,0,josephlord,,,"> The restrictions stem from a choice you have to make: If you use the Google ecosystem in your products, you have to use all of it, and you can&#x27;t use parts of Android to compete with the Google ecosystem. You can make the other choice, but, in those cases, Google doesn&#x27;t want you to have their closed, proprietary apps. That might be hard-nosed dealing, but it isn&#x27;t more restrictive than Google&#x27;s competitors are in similar circumstances.<p>Yes but that choice is not made on a per-product basis but on a global company wide basis. I could easily see this as being viewed as anti-competitive conduct (as I also saw MS deals penalising OEMs who shipped any products without Windows).<p>> The openness of AOSP is not compromised by this contract.<p>I disagree with that conclusion. As I read the article any company that accepts the agreement promises not to fork Android. Amazon does not sign this agreement and therefore can still use AOSP freely and openly but a large bulk of the world&#x27;s consumer electronic companies cannot. This doesn&#x27;t make AOSP closed but it does compromise its openness.",1392307149

As far as I can tell extensions like Evernote (3.2m users), Pocket (1.5m) and Buffer (250k) are heavily used, well understood, and loved by many average consumers.<p>You could make the argument that the variety of use cases is limited: all of the above are fairly simple &quot;click a button to save somewhere&quot; apps, and they don&#x27;t do too much fancy integration beyond laying an iframe with their save dialog onto the page.<p>Our own academic-focused extension (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paperpile-extension/bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paperpile-extensio...</a>) is a bit more niche, but does some cool stuff: we use the background page to parse metadata from PDFs, content scripts to insert buttons into academic search results (Buffer does something similar for Twitter), and it plugs into Google Docs to provide an extra layer of UI.<p>But alas, the most useful thing our extension does is similar to Evernote/Pocket/Buffer: save a piece of content (in this case journal articles) for later.<p>I think the problem with doing cool extension stuff is that it&#x27;s often really hard to get just right: you need to tread carefully when working on a system that could interfere with your user&#x27;s most basic browsing experience!",1392307060

But above there it&#x27;s not, and outside that local network it&#x27;s not.<p>In the US, this fact was pretty clearly demonstrated when the regulatory overhaul of the telephone industry in the 1990s introduced competition by requiring owners of the local copper to share it, and also by how people are able to choose their long distance carrier.

The popular ways I&#x27;ve seen are either Apache (with a very small max child process count), or php-fpm.<p>Also, it&#x27;s pretty well known that Wordpress is a dog in its standard configuration.  Using some sort of caching mechanism is required if you have any kind of traffic to the site (some like W3 Total Cache).<p>While there are fun benchmarking services like the blitz.io and LoadImpact.com, you can normally get a pretty good feel for how your site will do under a load using &quot;ab&quot; (apache benchmark) from your local machine.

7231973,comment,7231704,7231826,4,0,erichocean,,,"FWIW, one of the startups I&#x27;m CTO at is on DO now and looking to move off due to cost. DO is <i>great</i> for ultra cheap servers, but the cost of bigger servers is high (especially for non-dedicated hardware). Bandwidth is also expensive at DO, and I&#x27;m a bit concerned about the quality of that bandwidth, too.<p>We&#x27;re moving to OVH and their &quot;infrastructure&quot; line. We get a true VLAN, and the overall cost is ~1/3 of what DO charges for the same compute, RAM and bandwidth. Plus we get dedicated hardware, and 2x3TB hard drives in addition to the SSDs we&#x27;re adding ($7/month extra). The plan is to use the hard drives to offload our current usage of S3, which&#x27;ll save another $100K or so annually.<p>I also suspect OVH has &quot;better&quot; bandwidth than DO‚Äîmore POPs, backbone providers, etc. I actually really like how they&#x27;re doing things over their now. In the past, it seemed much more complicated, but their current lineup is substantially easier than AWS to understand and price out.

Overall though I think it is better to ask about it, because you really do need to know. I&#x27;ve heard though that a lot of people that do commit suicide are good at hiding things from people, even their family may not be aware that something is wrong, so even asking that question is not sufficient. When I hear about people committing suicide, I often think why didn&#x27;t anyone help them. Often the truth is that nobody was aware, that&#x27;s sad in it&#x27;s own way, but it does show that a lot of people can keep these things to themselves.<p>The next thing I felt about the suicide question was that it was a way of categorising people. If they considered suicide, then they need immediate help, otherwise it&#x27;s no so important, so offer them some pills, refer them to counselling (which was offered to me with a 4 month waiting list, that was not a lot of help). The pills weren&#x27;t what I needed anyway, so I didn&#x27;t really get a lot out of going to see the doctor. Talking to your family about it is a really important step though.",1392306689

MCS are used daily for processes/algorithms that are so difficult that a analytical solution is hard or impossible to find. You just throw in some data in your black box and put a &quot;probe&quot; at your variable that you&#x27;re interested in. Do it many times and you see the pattern (eg. plot a histogram when probing a variable of 1 dimension etc).<p>If you have an algorithm that you understand and is not too complicated, then I&#x27;d argue that MCS are NOT the way to go (maybe in addition but NOT solely). The reason is that due to the law of large numbers it keeps simulating the nice cases instead of the edge cases. Unless you change your input distribution.<p>I really expected the article to conclude with a link or explanation to Quickcheck [1] since this is <i>exactly</i> what the author is trying to get to (Ie automatically check the edge cases and automatically minimize the input which fails it).

We are approached by two very large businesses constantly complaining about the shortage of skilled workers. &quot;We can&#x27;t fill these jobs fast enough&quot; is the theme, and students bite constantly. These jobs range from machine operators, to skilled machinists to engineers.<p>One look at the job postings reveal a couple of themes:<p>Machine operator listed at $10.00; 28 hours a week, so they don&#x27;t have to provide benefits. That&#x27;s an unskilled position, so I don&#x27;t disagree with the wage. BUT, for the last 40 years, these positions were full-time with benefits. In the last 5 to 10 years they&#x27;ve been downsized to whatever the number is that keeps it just under full-time so the business doesn&#x27;t have to worry about benefits.<p>Skilled Machinist: the last post was for a master machinist (20 years exp? I&#x27;m not sure how long that takes) with various CAD, MAZAK and other various certifications depending on the job - one even required that the applicant be a Bridge certified welder in addition to master machinist (price those people out sometime). They listed at a ‚Äòcompetitive‚Äô $15-$25 an hour. That&#x27;s a joke for the time, energy and ability that it takes to do that job. If you ever want to see what the definition of good at everything is ‚Äì talk to a master machinist those men and women can quite literally use any piece of machinery that exists. These wages are almost identical to what this position made in the 1970&#x27;s. That is over 40 years later, and they expect to pay the same wage. I&#x27;m not certain what they post for a journeyman machinist, but I have to assume that it&#x27;s low as well.<p>Engineer: They can&#x27;t hire these, because &#x27;your institution isn&#x27;t turning out quality applicants&#x27;. We were spooked by this, so we did a careful inventory of current student prospects, and past graduate employment. Turns out that they can&#x27;t hire our graduates because they&#x27;re offering 30,XXX-45,XXX lower per year than John Deer, Caterpillar and other heavy machinery organizations that are within 4 hours of our town.  Granted, these businesses aren&#x27;t as large as JD or Cat, but they are still multi-billion dollar international companies.<p>My prediction is the following: In 10-15 years we will have an overabundance of ‚Äòskilled workers‚Äô in the manufacturing field, much as we have a surplus of college graduates right now. The message to kids used to be ‚Äògo to college,‚Äô now it‚Äôs ‚Äòbe an engineer or work in the manufacturing industry‚Äô. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before the software gets to the point that the monkey entering numbers doesn‚Äôt have to actually understand the numbers to turn out a product. When that happens, look out kiddos, the bottom will drop out of that market as well. My proof? Five years ago our first-time, first-year students were 75% liberal arts/soft sciences, 25% hard sciences and engineering. Our enrollment figures for Fall 2014 show more of a 50/50 split, with the number of new engineering students growing faster than any other category. This shift is nearly unprecedented.<p>The train is headed down the tracks full speed, and no one is manning the brakes.",1392305581

Behind the scenes, the bank trades the strategy (or something like it) in order to hedge the risk associated with the swap, so that they can earn the fee approximately risk free.<p>There&#x27;s an obvious problem with this, which is that the client basically has to take the bank&#x27;s word for what the profit/loss of the strategy is. To counter that, the guy who came up with the strategy now has to write a 100+ page document in legalese, which outlines exactly how the profit/loss on the strategy is calculated. This has to be sufficiently detailed that someone couple re-implement the code themselves to check it. The guy I spoke to said that this documentation takes up >50% of his time.<p>I&#x27;m sure everyone here will appreciate how incredible it is that a bank will pay someone six figures every year to spend more than half their time writing documentation that literally does nothing more than <i>reproduce a piece of code</i>, except about 50 times more verbosely.<p><i>Different symbols, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything.</i>",1392305310

I was talking to the owner of one school and the topic of military pilots came up.<p>It was mentioned that in the current model the only military pilot that will be hired by commercial carriers are the cargo pilots - the guy who can fly heavy.  Helicopter pilots  make an easy transition but that is not a &quot;commercial&quot; job like we normally think but it is well paying and almost impossible to get into.  Fighter pilots are a different breed and do not transition well into commercial piloting.<p>But, to answer your real question - YES!  Absolutely you can.  It is hard work.  You can go different routes.  Ignoring the military option, you can go directly to your commercial license or go to a university that has a flight school.  The benefit of the university option is that you have a real degree that goes along with your commercial certification.  Both options cost a ton of money.  Planes are expensive.  Fuel is expensive.  There are loans.<p>Going direct for your cert can also take different routes.  You don&#x27;t have to go to a big-name school.  There are a lot of schools that offer a fast track.  You&#x27;ll get your private in 6 weeks the commercial some months after that and the entire time you&#x27;re building the hours you need.  Some will help find you a job after.  If you have the option of living at home, you can get a commercial license yourself.  Find a local flight school and just go at your own pace.  Get your private license first and see how you like it.<p>For me, I had to stop midway through my private license.  I loved it but becoming a commercial pilot is a choice for the young.  The union/seniority/salary structure of the airlines doesn&#x27;t lend itself to older guys switching over.  I had a family to take care of the the benefits and money wouldn&#x27;t really kick in until 5-8 years down the road.

KISS means a faster time to market. Faster time to iterate. Faster time to fix bugs because there are fewer places those bugs can be. All of that doesn&#x27;t even factor in the productivity benefits gained by not having to switch technologies from project to project.<p>But to be fair, ES is not some brand new database...

These are the licensing terms for Google&#x27;s closed-source suite of ecosystem apps that turn a generic AOSP-based port into a Google-logo commercial product.<p>The restrictions stem from a choice you have to make: If you use the Google ecosystem in your products, you have to use all of it, and you can&#x27;t  use parts of Android to compete with the Google ecosystem. You can make the other choice, but, in those cases, Google doesn&#x27;t want you to have their closed, proprietary apps. That might be hard-nosed dealing, but it isn&#x27;t more restrictive than Google&#x27;s competitors are in similar circumstances.<p>There are some seemingly nonsensical parts to the agreement, especially the prohibition against distributing an SDK derived from the Android SDK. I&#x27;m having a difficult time imagining what harm that might cause. Some OEMs, like Samsung, are shipping SDK extensions that Google apparently is fine with.<p>The openness of AOSP is not compromised by this contract. Amazon is an example of a partly direct competitor using AOSP. Google has done nothing to thwart Amazon, not even a hint of FUD. If only Oracle were that straightforward about Java.",1392303644

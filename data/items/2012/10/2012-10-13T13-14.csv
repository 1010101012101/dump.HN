4648594,comment,4648364,4648364,2,0,mtgx,,,"They sound like very reasonable proposals, that I would think most people with common sense with accept. I especially find interesting the proposal to use R&D for the pharmaceutical industry from the Government. I just don't know how practical that is. It would need serious commitment and serious investment from Governments to do that.<p>In countries where healthcare is also paid by the Government, that might work, but I doubt many of them would take on it eventually. I don't think any of this would be implemented in US in the short to medium term, though, as that kind of proposal would be immediately considered communist by half the country (especially if Fox News has anything to say about it).<p>I'm also not sure if I would let the Government be 100% responsible for the pharmaceutical R&D, but maybe it could use taxpayer money for some R&D anyway, and any drug that comes out of it, would be patent-free. Think of it as the open source Linux to Microsoft's Windows, or Firefox to IE. Companies would still be free to patent drugs and sell them for whatever they want, but the Government would be able to reverse engineer or create very similar alternatives that are patent-free, and much cheaper.",1350136782

4648591,comment,4646484,4646484,0,0,trendspotter,,,"I completely disagree with the theory ""Startup = Idea"".<p>My counter argument is:
""Good Ideas Grow On Trees""<p>Working with a startup myself, I can clearly see why Paul Graham nailed it down to ""growth"" and not ""idea"".<p>The ""idea"" part of an startup is the easy one. I scientifically researched the topic 'innovation capability' and 'innovativeness' of organizations and the crucial part is not to come up with an idea. As said ""good ideas grow on trees"". The hard work is the execution of an startup idea to get ""growth"".<p>The main difference between startups is not their idea, but their growth. Many people can come up with a new startup idea in days, maybe even with a new idea within minutes. But it can take years to bring an idea to success.<p>Here are examples of good ideas that are growing on trees:
<a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-first-time-entrepreneur-to-get-word-out-about-their-startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-first-time-e...</a><p>There are endless startup ideas. Even the idea newness, how radical new a startup idea is, is not the main aspect of an startup. Again the main difference between startups is if they can execute the idea and get growth.
For example with our startup we were the first to hit a large, untapped or underserved market. But the lack of execution and growth was what killed it. There are always other people who sooner or later have a similar idea. The main difference again is which startup executes the idea the best, the fastest and gets the most growth.",1350136584

I suspect the engineering barriers in developing an OMAP class processor are much lower than what AMD has to deal with it in x86 and graphics markets. There is a large amount of off the shelf IP for mobile application processors and they have lots of internal knowledge they could use to customize the ICs (graphics, core architecture).<p>The problem there is that I'm not sure who the buyers are - the two giants (Apple and Samsung) are making their own processors, so unless you're making cut price ICs (a very crowded market) you are somewhat limited. I don't think the Tegra is bad from a technical standpoint, it's just that the number of really high volume customers is not infinite.<p>Nevertheless I'd love to see AMD stepping away from the x86 game into a wide ARM portfolio. I'm sure ARM would play ball, it'd be a major win for them and with ATI's graphics/hpc expertise we could see killer solutions.",1350135816

It depends on how distant and how dense they are, doesn't it?  Even assuming that the universe is infinite and eternal and approximately equally dense everywhere.<p>The embedded video describes the paradox by saying that the night sky ""should be as bright as the sun"".  Imagine if that were the case.  Then move yourself twice as close to the sun, making the sun four times brighter.  Then the night sky is 1/4 as bright as the sun.<p>So clearly, distance and (lack of) density could make the night sky less bright, presumably to below the threshold of human perception.  Right?

Barring being a feminist, the only option left is that you must be a misogynist.<p>I don't call myself a suffragette, either, but that doesn't mean I am against women being allowed to vote.  I consider myself very much anti-sexist and pro-equality, because sexism is still a problem in my society.  However, oppressive attitudes based on gender and sexuality are frequently perpetuated by people who call themselves feminists, and anti-male sexism (perpetuated by feminists in particular) is on the rise.</i>",1350133919

Consulting a clinical psychologist and Googling around on the phrase ""mindfulness-based stress reduction"" lead me to believe that 4 minutes a day suffices to get that effect.<p>Also, those 3-5 minutes sometimes cause subjective experiences of increased calmness that tend to last the rest of the day.<p>It probably takes longer durations to achieve some of the other effects commonly ascribed to meditation (e.g., becoming more contented). I have tried longer durations, but I judge that in my particular case they are more likely to be harmful than helpful.<p>Specifically, I have a bit of a chronic health problem which necessitates that my immune system remain always strong and active.  Getting too much sun and not getting enough sleep are 2 things that personal experiences lead me to believe are bad for me -- and according to immunology researchers, those 2 things suppress the immune system.  The suppression tends to last only a few hours or a day, but that is long enough for me to notice bad effects.  Meditating for hours at a time produced subjective effects in me similar to the effects of those 2 other things that suppress my immune system.<p>So, that is one reason I avoid long meditation sessions and tend to advise other people with chronic health issues similar to mine to do the same.<p>Sometimes (particularly, in the rare situation described in grandparent in which the first meditation session of the day ends with me looking at a web browser, looking at some file on my computer or doing something else other than meditating) I do 2 to 4 sessions (of 3 to 5 minutes each) a day, and I have not experienced the adverse health effect mentioned above on such days.<p>By the way, a large part of time I am meditating I am resisting urges (the theme of the OP) rather than doing what most meditators describe, namely, resisting attachment to or involvement in sensations or resisting dwelling on regrets about the past or worries about the future. Specifically, urges to execute a sequence of motor actions (e.g., get out of my chair and move something that needs moving) or to plan out how to achieve some goal.",1350133903

I doubt his understanding of feminism is much deeper than some garbage he read on an MRA site once, and thus it follows that he's likely to be wrong about a lot of other things due to having an axe to grind whilst simultaneously being an ignoramus.<p>I mean look at the description of his YouTube channel:<p>""What is equality? We in the men's rights movement believe in equality of opportunity, that as long as the playing field is level then the outcomes should not matter. <i>The feminists tend to believe that equality of outcome is what matters</i>, that the columns under men and women must match for there to be no more sexism. So what really matters at the end of the day is what you are comparing. Rights or outcomes? This is the foundation of our debate.""<p>So essentially his entire worldview is based on a complete strawman. Skills.",1350133819

Just imagine that we could've had classes with inheritance instead, which would reduce time spent on debugging the selector mess it is now; browsers would also parse the styles much faster. And then we could build modules or components, themes and frameworks on top of that. Add a semantic constraint engine with parametric styles (so I can say if I want two elements to align in some way), support for calculations, and coding CSS would be fun instead of frustrating.

A couple of loops,comparing pairs of objects, triple assignment with a temp - what's that all about?  You may be able to explain it/ teach it easier because its smaller, but the code is not transparent.<p>I'd suggest a recursive algorithm would code up far more transparently.  E.g. Sort first half of the list; sort 2nd half of the list; merge the two half-lists. That's obvious at the top level; the details of merge are all that's left to explain. It also demonstrates dissecting a problem into smaller problems, so is a double lesson.",1350133541

To use a parallel, you can commercially facilitate non-commercial <i>dating</i> as much as you like, and many websites make a killing out of doing so. If they were to facilitate <i>commercial dating</i> (prostitution), it would be a different matter, and that would be illegal in most places.<p>But as long as the main activity is legal, then of course it's also legal to commercially aid somebody in doing so. Entire industries are built on that fundamental logic.<p>Cheers,

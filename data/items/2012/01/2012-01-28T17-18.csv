Tower, a git GUI for Mac OS X, has a great interface and ties in very well with the core git functionality. I've learned a lot about stashing, merge conflict resolution, and cherry-picking, thanks to that app. Also, Tower shows a tree graph, similar to the network diagram the author ""seriously cannot live without.""<p>Why knock visual tools when when you rely on them so much?",1327773573

He wrote a nice series of blog posts about it that begins at <a href=""http://billwadge.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/lucid-the-origins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billwadge.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/lucid-the-origins</a>.<p>His insight was that x = x + 1 isn't contradictory once you recognize that the two x's have implicit temporal subscripts. That is, ""the value of x at time t+1 = the value of x at time t, plus 1"". Make that temporal dimension explicit in the language and you can go back to having a nice equational semantics.<p>It's interesting, though, and perhaps germane to your point, that this insight turned out to lead far away from mainstream languages.<p>I've come to the conclusion that math and programming are very different things because math isn't executable. Programs have to run on a physical machine, math doesn't. The ""physical"" part changes everything. As someone pointed out in a blog post recently, even programs written in the purest most side-effect-free languages have side-effects when they run. I suspect that functional programming ultimately runs aground on this discrepancy - i.e. on the intrinsic imperativeness of the machine. The ""x = x+1"" paradox can be seen as a distillation of this imperativeness.<p>Perhaps we should teach programming not as math but as a kind of mechanics.",1327771384

I had the coding finished in roughly 3 months and we were just waiting on the design.

I've always suspected something like this; although mainly that's just from my personal experience when I haven't used ESD, sometimes I've given a board a bad shock and it still miraculously worked afterwards.  I've even seen people plug in power supplies backwards, smoke a component on a board, and have the computer still miraculously boot afterwards.  No idea if the computer was stable long term, but it's surprising sometimes how much damage these components can take.  Then again, on the other hand, sometimes they stop working when they are in a clean room where everyone wears Intel bunny suits and is grounded 24/7.",1327770555

3522538,comment,3518426,3522172,1,0,illumin8,,,"I used to be a Sun field engineer.  I had a foldable static mat with wrist straps in the pockets.  It literally took me less than 30 seconds to unfold the mat, slide on the strap, and throw whatever system board I was repairing on the mat.  The mat was padded as well, so I didn't have to worry about finding a safe surface to drop a 10 pound system board on.<p>The reason why the Dell techs are not using wrist straps is because they are lazy, and they know that even if ESD causes a component failure, some other poor tech will get the follow up service call and just come replace another part, or replace the same part again.<p>Have you ever wondered why a lot of replacement parts, after being installed without ESD protection, somehow are DOA (dead on arrival)?  The factory that manufactures them surely tests them before shipping.<p>Are you seriously arguing that static charges of several thousand volts can't damage integrated circuits?",1327770419

This makes both centralized updates and pre-update snapshotting much more feasible.<p>I'm really looking forward to this feature. With appropriate support from the file system and yum, it seems like it brings us one step closer to truly transactional multi-package system updates/software installations. Yes, some of this was already possible with snapshotting support in a plugin for Yum, but I think the consolidation will likely make implementing such features simpler and more robust.",1327770316

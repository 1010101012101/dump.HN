In too many articles like this, it&#x27;s clear that the author cares more that the child adopts the parent&#x27;s ideology than that the child is actually happy.  The goals and methods were moderate: earning one&#x27;s own money (at an appropriate age), learning to control one&#x27;s own life (I would add &quot;to the extent possible&quot;) and not over or undervaluing wealth.<p>My only reservation was the artificial 10% interest rate.  The current interest rate is 0%.  Over the last 100 years interest rates averaged 5%.

9591820,comment,9586515,9589101,0,0,liquid8r,,,"When you roast beans, you introduce CO2. For a few hours after roasting, CO2 escapes, which is the process called degassing or off-gassing. When you grind, more CO2 escapes. Limiting CO2 impact on coffee is well understood by the industry -- you can degas in a nitrogen environment, for example.<p>We at HiLine Coffee did a lot of testing with different single-serve pods, and I can assure you that you can tell the quality changes over time (what you get with 1 month old pod and what you get after 6 months taste very different). This is one of the reasons why Nespresso, Keurig and other large manufacturers don&#x27;t state the date of the roast on packaging. People wouldn&#x27;t want to buy 6 months old coffee. Instead they buy coffee that is &quot;best consumed by&quot; a date in 6 months, whatever that means, particularly since stale coffee doesn&#x27;t have any discernible health effects other than sadness from poor taste. After spending more than a year working on new ways to better preserve ground coffee in single serve packaging, we determined that the only sure way to deliver fresh and great tasting coffee in a pod is to roast for each individual order. This is the model that we are testing now.

Because remember, math is not an ordered execution of statements, it’s equality. You are not describing what to do, you’re describing what is.<p>I think this is my fundamental concern with Haskell. &quot;Describing what is&quot;, aka mathematics, has two fundamental problems:<p>1) It is <i>hard</i> to reason about. After all, the entirety of mathematics, including problems outstanding for hundreds of years, concern these problems.<p>2) Describing what is does not give you what is.<p>In math you first describe what is, then work really hard to prove that it actually is, and after all of that work you still don&#x27;t actually have the thing that is.<p>Obviously Haskell <i>is</i> concerned with what actually is, and obviously the compiler can&#x27;t do arbitrarily difficult mathematical analysis, so in practice you&#x27;re left with a &quot;describe what is&quot; language that is arbitrarily less powerful than real math, and arbitrarily more concerned with laying things out so a computer can do it (being imperative, essentially).

I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Stoicism, but Buddhism sounds very similar in some respects:<p>&quot;• What is the Second Noble Truth?<p>The second truth is that suffering is caused by craving and aversion. We will suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectation, if we want others to like us, if we do not get something we want,etc. In other words, getting what you want does not guarantee happiness. Rather than constantly struggling to get what you want, try to modify your wanting. Wanting deprives us of contentment and happiness. A lifetime of wanting and craving and especially the craving to continue to exist, creates a powerful energy which causes the individual to be born. So craving leads to physical suffering because it causes us to be reborn.<p>• What is the Third Noble Truth?<p>The third truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness can be attained; that true happiness and contentment are possible. lf we give up useless craving and learn to live each day at a time (not dwelling in the past or the imagined future) then we can become happy and free.

Not the first time the Iraqi &quot;army&quot; does that.<p>The Peshmerga desperately need Anti-Tank/IED gear. So far they are relying on MILANs from Germany. \nThey have enough trained soldiers and experienced soldiers from old wars to tackle ISIS, but they are working with some really old weapons. I&#x27;ve seen snipers using old ww2 rifles. \nNo joke.<p>From what I understand there is a bill at congress (pushed by the Republicans) to arm the Peshmerga (Kurdistan) directly instead of relying on Baghdad (HAH!) to give the the kurds their 10% share. Not sure if it has passed yet.<p>Essentially the Iraqi &quot;Army&quot; has failed, the only thing that is stable in Iraq is the &quot;Gold Division&quot;, essentially their Special Forces. They are pretty effective at holding ISIS at bay, but have endured heavy casualties because of the Militia/Army incompetence.<p>The Shia militia can&#x27;t hold their grounds... except when it comes to abusing Sunni civilians.<p>Iraq doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. It&#x27;s now Iran... the US is arming Iran 😂. Let that sink in.",1432346605

They have everything to do with minimizing impact to the environment, the marine and coastal ecosystem, and our fisheries.  The Coast Guard is also tasked with protecting the Maritime Economic Defense Zone, so I guess you could argue that there is a financial motivation to protect our nation&#x27;s interests, but I don&#x27;t like the implication that the CG is a corporate shill.

At 600$ it was twice as expensive as the nicest suits on the market, I&#x27;m lucky enough to live near a Patagonia store though and they had a yearly wetsuit sale so I paid 450$. Still an outrageous price for a suit. Most wetsuits last me about three seasons, I still wear that first Patagonia suit though. It was starting to show it&#x27;s age last year so I brought it to the store and they shipped it to their repair shop up north, and then back to my house. They replaced all of the inside seams, a zipper, and added a key loop (a feature the original didn&#x27;t even have). They did all this FOR FREE.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as anti-consumerism, because they sell stuff. I do think the brand encourages thoughtful consumerism though, and mostly by producing products and services that reset your bar for value against cost.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman-ebook/dp/B000SEGEVC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1432346408&sr=1-1&keywords=let+my+people+go+surfing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessm...</a>",1432346480

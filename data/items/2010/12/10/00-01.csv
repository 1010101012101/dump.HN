1990070,comment,1988239,1989985,0,0,rbancroft,,,"Perhaps, but as I mentioned in my last comment, formal reasoning often breaks down when dealing with anything more than the simplest of systems. What kind of axioms can you reason from in software? The network is always slow: not always, memory is always abundant, not always, the disk is always slow, with virtual memory, not always, exponential time complexity is always bad... not always. And especially, factor in cost, which is one of the most important aspects, and that severely impacts even the ability to formally reason since the most correct version can also be the most expensive and time consuming to implement..<p>Anyways, I didn't mean to downplay formal reasoning, but just to indicate that it is not often practical to use those methods exclusively when building software.",1291942791

It is a belief for which you've provided no evidence to support. You're making an assumption here.<p><i>To that the best I can come up with is to take at look at early American politics, when the parties first developed after the founding of the government. At that time it was a pretty even split (as far as I have been told)</i><p>I really don't see how going back in time helps your argument at all. The nature of political parties and how Americans understand them has changed significantly over time, to say nothing of the demographics of the group we call scientists. Going back in time raises a whole lot more questions than it answers.<p><i>To that the best I can come up with is to take at look at early American politics, when the parties first developed after the founding of the government.

But I've read Altermeyer's  book and there are lots of researchers who are careful. The Wikipedia link I gave above gives a good summary.

Lobbies introduce market concerns to a generally one-man-one-vote representative democratic process.<p>My point about Africa is not about who should be labelled a leader or a government: it is that development doesn't need just money, it needs institutions, education, trust… Things that take time; things with massive externalities. Throwing billions like fastballs won't help anyone from benefitting from those. Do you think that William Kamkwamba (the heavily publicized boy who couldn't go to school, yet made a windmill himself) needs 10k$ or 100M$, or does he need roads, electricity, running water to his village?

Civil disobedience has never been limited to ""we're accepting punishment for {x} to demonstrate that doing {x} should not be punished."" In many cases, it has been  ""we're accepting punishment for {x} to demonstrate that doing {y} should not be punished, or to demonstrate that doing [z] should be punished or stopped or whatever."" The scope has always been wide, and activists rarely staged illegal sit-ins, for example, just to demonstrate that sit-ins shouldn't be illegal. So the question you pose has wide relevance. You can start to come at the answer in a variety of ways, but perhaps the first if sometimes insufficient criterion of justifiable civil disobedience might be that the illegal protest action should aim at preventing greater harm than it causes, and it should be action against organizations that are significantly responsible for the harm you want to prevent. I think that criterion is satisfied in this case; that is, I think much greater harm is caused longterm by the permanent restriction of funding for Wikileaks than is caused by temporary DDoS'ing MC, Visa, and Paypal.",1291941977
1990025,comment,1988926,1989004,0,0,MrFoof,,,"This is indeed true, and I'll never fault anyone for it.  Though rarely have I encountered a rejection in which I didn't feel the same way -- actually, if I have a sense that something is amiss I prod around for it rather deliberately to see what sort of answers I can get out of folks.  Sometimes you get the obvious red flags you were looking for, complete with obvious body language and visible frustration.<p>Recently I quit my job and put myself out there again.  One company employs headhunters and has a <i>very</i> well-known developer in their employ.  So at the time I was pretty chuffed to line up an interview, figuring I had no risk of ""slamming into the ceiling"" at all.  I already had two offers in front of me, but I figured it was worth pursuing.<p>The best way I could describe the interview is if you were walking about as a child and saw an action movie hero that your admired -- and watched him punch out a six year old that happened to be in his way.  Before he interviewed me the group manager asked what blogs I read, and I rifled them off with my thoughts on them.  One I had mentioned that I didn't read, but that I was aware that he was attempting to make a name for himself by making more complex topics accessible to Joe average.  Before the manager left he sternly warned me that if I were to mention that name in front of this individual, the interview would end immediately.<p>The fellow himself was abrupt, intimidating, and rather smug.  I've interviewed hundreds of people, so I can sympathize to an extent regarding the monotony of asking the same questions over and over, but I was able to gauge from other team members that he simply wasn't having a bad day, but that's how he is to folks outside of his circle.<p>The recruiter had me come back in person to say that I was considered brilliant technically, but they would pass.  She couldn't figure out why, so I mentioned that he gave pretty clear feedback on twitter, and it's not the first time he's done it.  I pulled out my phone to prove it.<p>The recruiter was a superbly nice person, the type that worries about and tries to take care of everyone.  She was shocked to the verge of tears -- an opportunity she sells as manna from heaven, and those were the kinds of comments he'd pass on to thousands of people as opposed to delivering directly to the individual.  I didn't consider his criticism harsh, as it was valid to pass on someone who wasn't a very assertive and confident Type A personality when your organization has invested decades in building up that specific culture.  Not to mention it's difficult to seem eager when considering the prospect of working with an outright bully.  She was upset enough that she had to leave the room, and the account manager and I spent the next hour dissecting the organization's culture.<p>I think that's the only time I can ever really consider a rejection to not be kosher.  Fortunately, the universe has a way of balancing these things out.  His group is now one of my clients.  I can't wait to see the look on his face when I pop into the room.",1291941971

1990005,comment,1989286,1989286,0,0,revorad,,,"Hugh MacLeod's legendary ""How To Be Creative"" article had a great point which is meant mainly for artists, but I think applies to entrepreneurs as well, at least when you talk about passion.<p><i>Don’t worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.</i><p>See no.24 - <a href=""http://changethis.com/manifesto/6.HowToBeCreative/pdf/6.HowToBeCreative.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://changethis.com/manifesto/6.HowToBeCreative/pdf/6.HowT...</a><p>Sorry the blog post seems to have disappeared, all I could find was the PDF.<p>It is so good, I must quote all of it:<p><i>Don’t worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.<p>Inspiration precedes the desire to create, not the other way around.<p>One of the reasons I got into drawing cartoons on the back of business cards was I could carry them around with me. Living downtown, you spend a lot of time walking around the place. I wanted an art form that was perfect for that.<p>So if I was walking down the street and I suddenly got hit with the itch to draw something, I could just nip over to the nearest park bench or coffee shop, pull out a blank card from my bag and get busy doing my thing. Seamless. Effortless. No fuss. I like it.<p>Before, when I was doing larger works, every time I got an idea while walking down the street Iʼd have to quit what I was doing and schlep back to my studio while the inspiration was still buzzing around in my head. Nine times out of ten the inspired moment would have passed by the time I got back, rendering the whole exercise futile. Sure, Iʼd get drawing anyway, but it always seemed I was drawing a memory, not something happening at that very moment.<p>If youʼre arranging your life in such a way that you need to make a lot of fuss between feeling the itch and getting to work, youʼre putting the cart before the horse. Youʼre probably creating a lot of counterproductive “Me, The Artist, I must create, I must leave something to posterity” melodrama. Not interesting for you or for anyone else.<p>You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long.<p>Conversely, neither should you fret too much about “writerʼs block,” “artistʼs block,” or whatever. If youʼre looking at a blank piece of paper and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writerʼs block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something.<p>Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. In the meantime, youʼre better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures, and refilling your well. Trying to create when you donʼt feel\nlike it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation. Itʼs not really connecting, itʼs just droning on like an old, drunken barfly.</i>",1291941722

Of course this is tautologically true depending on one's personal definition of civil disobedience, no true Scotsman and such, but would exclude a lot of history, such as the Underground Railroad.<p>The article did have a nice quote directed at that point of view, though:<p>""There may be many times when protestors <i>choose</i> to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they <i>must</i> go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated."" --Paul Flowers",1291941597

Anti-trust is a classic, albeit minimal socialist law; it is also coherent with populism. Anti-trust is necessary as the last control in a free capitalist market, but is rather contradictory with private property being absolute. Other notable economic system around <i>property</i> include Saint-Marc doctrine (a man can steal to feed his family if its his last resort, that has been extended to land expropriation after  peasant revolts), financial capitalism, or Rhine capitalism, where the means of production are family-owned, but social ties between owners offer a conventional control and can be used to enforce standards (like paternalism).<p>The last one is the system described in Karl Marx's <i>The Capital</i> It's also slightly incoherent with free market, because properties can't be exchanged freely: the community of owners have a say, albeit implicit. The best current example of that is Silicon Valley, where Arrington can sell TechCrunch to AOL, but still has to pull up a couple of stunts to prove his editorial independence; or where the value of your start-up is dependent on PG's impression of you being a nice guy. It's usually a very efficient system, especially with innovation, but it is quite “unfair”: winners are not always the absolute best (well, they tend to) but generally make orders of magnitude more money. It's acceptable in SV because most people have enough money to eat, and those who own redistribute it, but it wasn't so acceptable when the children of Rothshild's workers starved.<p>Free market, vs. planned economy are system that consider <i></i>production<i></i>. You can have a planed economy with private ownership (France in the 70s) or free market with very strong control over workers benefits, like Switzerland. Because large corporation have far more responsibility (thanks to heavy State controls on the job market) Switzerland indeed has a lot of SMEs.<p>I have no idea why you asked you last question: it goes well beyond the usual straw-man.",1291939812

It is not that Bush lied to these voters about his issue preferences: they just liked him for other reasons and ascribed their own issue preferences to him.<p>John Sides explains a related phenomena here: <a href=""http://www.themonkeycage.org/2010/08/me_talking_to_politico_on_2010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themonkeycage.org/2010/08/me_talking_to_politico_...</a> whereby voters don't necessarily know much about most issues and end up adopting issue positions held by parties they trust.

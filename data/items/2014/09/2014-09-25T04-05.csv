You can sleep more easily tonight.<p>Typically the CVE is assigned when the vulnerability is reported to the maintainer after it&#x27;s initially discovered, before it&#x27;s been made public.  So really the difference represents how many other vulnerabilities there&#x27;s been between the first time this was discovered (which could be months, could be weeks, I didn&#x27;t check) until now.<p>Since 7169 was only discovered today, it immediately got assigned a new CVE while still public.<p>Also, the last number in the ID represents the total number of vulnerabilities tracked by CVEs in the year mentioned in th middle.

That said: ignition means the electrical system that fires the spark plugs. Starter is the motor that starts the mechanical bits moving, so the ignition can do its job and keep the mechanical bits moving. Any car with the traditional keyed start even shows these circuits as separate positions on the cylinder. Most motorcycles have separate controls for those two circuits: a toggle switch for ignition, and a momentary switch for starter--you must set ignition to &quot;on&quot; before the starter will do any good.<p>Disable the ignition system, and nothing&#x27;s going anywhere. Disable the starter motor, and it&#x27;s just not going to start--unless you push it down a hill or, say, short the relay with a screwdriver (as mentioned in the article).<p>While technically you could put a remote controlled relay anywhere (the dome light won&#x27;t light up if you&#x27;re late on payments--take that!) it sounds from the description of the device (&quot;starter interrupt&quot;) and other clues that it&#x27;s the starter system that&#x27;s being killed.

Yes, I used the word &quot;hopefully&quot; in that sentence in a non-accidental way: boondoggles happen.  A <i>lot</i>.  They also <i>don&#x27;t</i> happen a lot. Modern governments are huge, on a scale that has never existed before [0].  Expect frequent outliers in every direction.<p>Government spending must be essentially zero sum, since it almost exclusively must spend within a closed system (it&#x27;d be a bit silly for it to primarily spend on some other country&#x27;s, after all). But to say that government spending can&#x27;t be as productive as individual taxpayer spending is sort of misunderstanding scope. The typical person can&#x27;t be bothered to deal with the coordination of funding all the things they&#x27;d like; the number of services that gently affect our lives is staggering.  To suggest the individual administrate such spending is like suggesting we generate a line item for everything the government provides and be able to select what we personally want from it; there&#x27;s a utopia to be had there, but holy mackerel the logistical coordination and administrative overhead for such a system would be mind-bogglingly complex and large, or the life simple, dull, and risky. I bet there&#x27;s a Murphy&#x27;s Law corollary somewhere that suggests such a fair replacement is at least as dysfunctional as the current system (heck, I&#x27;ll just invoke the central theorem of Systemantics [1]).<p>Anyhow, the win here is that governments can concentrate money to generate a kind of critical mass, It can create opportunities that otherwise couldn&#x27;t germinate (and, well, often don&#x27;t). Some accomplishments require ridiculous amounts of money - more than a person could ever hope to have. Until <i>very</i> recently (say last ten years?), it hasn&#x27;t been possible for extremely large groups of people to coordinate resources for extremely large technologically and logistically complex projects without also having a very direct, obvious, and positive feedback mechanism (read: short-term profit); crowd sourcing may actually be a fantastic replacement economically for government&#x27;s deep pockets, but we&#x27;re absolutely not there yet. And without that insane access to enormous capital, we simply can&#x27;t bootstrap many of these industries. There are notable exceptions, but they&#x27;re <i>notable</i> because of how uncommon and unlikely they are; legends arise from powerful individuals building massive industry sectors, but rarely without extensive help from the government (obligatory references to Standard Oil and SpaceX).<p>So we rely on the government to do such things as bootstrap super-capital intensive stuff.  The sort of things that require billions to begin and decades to mature.  And 50 years later, it&#x27;s clearly paying off! What once required tens of billions to do once now can be done for tens of <i>m</i>illions! And it&#x27;s gotten so mature, the private sector is finally starting to compete with the government... <i>here</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue the value of a space program.  It&#x27;s so deeply integral to the magic of modern life it&#x27;s dizzyingly complex to even contemplate listing. Like trying to figure out if it was worth Bell Labs allowing the transistor to be invented.<p>India&#x27;s got a helluva scrappy space program.  It manages to do a lot of things right, and as noted elsewhere by &#x27;tn13 [2], it may even be profitable!

This includes protections to prevent property owners from blocking access. Trying to limit such access is pretty much seen as morally similar to theft.<p>The modern justification is that any restriction of access is a substantial limitation of the freedom of the public, and that if you wish to maximize freedom, you must limit the ability of property owners and find a balance that protects their ability to secure their home and business and protect their privacy but without taking away public freedoms that predates even our written laws.

Also:<p><i>Global Search.</i>  How do you do a global search on Android? On Android it&#x27;s right on the home screen, with iOS it&#x27;s there on the home screen but a little hidden.<p><i>Privacy/Permissions.</i> How does one control the privacy settings on their device and know/control which app is accessing what? Android has permissions management per app, iOS has privacy management in its settings. They are both easy and clear to access and modify.<p><i>Backups.</i> iCloud is essentially perfect, very futuristic, it backs up almost everything wirelessly; Android is great because all your data (contacts, calendar, photos, etc) is with Google and easily sync to your device, although I am unsure if it as robust as iCloud which essentially keeps a carbon copy of your phone.<p><i>Easy unlocking.</i> The newest iPhones have TouchID, just tap and unlocked. Android has had patterns since forever and it has face unlock, also the newer Samsung phones have finger print unlock as well. It can be very frustrating typing a passcode each time you want to unlock your device.<p><i>Design and detail.</i> Google and Apple are giving me the chills in this arena. iOS has always looked great and Material Design is hands down the best design language I&#x27;ve seen this year, sometimes I get a little envious of the design vs iOS. Google did an amazing job with that. Blackberry on the other hand has a design that is old that doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s had the amount of thought that its competitors have. Apple, Google, and Microsoft not only understand how to make something that looks good, but also something that is intuitive, delightful to use, and focused.<p><i>Interoperability with existing services and devices.</i> What if you have a PC or Mac or a tablet? How well will your Blackberry play with them? Apple devices work best with other Apple devices, but seeing that Google and Microsoft have extremely strong and versatile services, their products will work well on iOS. Android devices use Google services, which work well across platforms. MS devices use MS services which work well on Windows devices which are everywhere.<p><i>Strong commitment to platform services.</i> Apple keeps building new services. Google is always building new services. Microsoft is now building new services. They all have a relentless command over their platform and show commitment to making their services better and useful. Siri, Google Now, Cortana, all compete with each other, all very strong services. Apple, Google, and Microsoft are simply the only companies with the resources to do things like these.<p><i>Always something around the corner.</i> These companies work hard to make sure they keep us on our toes, this year I was impressed by Swift by and Android L by Google, I&#x27;m looking forward to Windows 9 from Microsoft.<p><i>Changes the industry and world.</i> Apple, Google and Microsoft&#x27;s changes are a shockwave throughout our lives. Collectively, they have an enormous power over billions of people and are changing lives every day. For instance, now that they&#x27;ve chose our Health and wearable devices as the new battlefield, we will probably see a massive changes of healthcare and fitness.<p><i>Wearables and Health.</i> Stated previously but I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough. We are all underestimating the power of wearables and the next few years will yield amazing technologies and transformations.<p><i>Home automation.</i> For now the media has forgotten the release of HomeKit by Apple and how there are no products that support it right now, but boy am I excited to tell Siri to turn off my lights. I imagine Google will be doing interesting things with Nest and Microsoft has been toying with Home Automation for decades. This will be extremely interesting...<p><i>Free stuff, good customer service.</i> I love all the free software from Apple (iWork, iLife) as well as the free repairs and replacements! I love Google Voice/Hangouts, Google Authenticator (app and server), Chrome and countless other really geeky Google services and advancements. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t give me anything free that makes me joyful, but they are becoming a much more responsive company.<p><i>Tons of support.</i> Because these companies have big platforms its not hard to discover if someone else has a problem (and solution) as well. Also they are quick to take care of issues.<p><i>Not going anywhere.</i> I am sure that these companies will be around in the year 2100. I can keep some of my products as old relics. They will be in textbooks. I want to be on the right side of history.<p>These are many, but few out of the many reasons I think Blackberry devices seem painfully mediocre.<p>Edit: formatting and grammar",1411618642

Actually comparatively even compared to many Indian IT professionals salaries of these folks is actually low.<p>Most people don&#x27;t realize how low it is until you start comparing yourself with people of your same age some 10-15 years in to your career who are working with other software companies.<p>Any decent IIT grad joining something like Amazon or Google gets ~15L-18L per annum these days, If you are from other colleges you can still get ~10L per annum. And this is for writing some HTML or some application around a data base. Heck even people working at IT services industry get paid around ~4-5 L per annum, and plus they can always move on to some nice after a few years, most do and within 8-10 years of their careers can reach atleast ~15L per annum. Plus some people also get foreign travel opportunities. If you have a good saving and investments discipline you can buy youself a home, a car and may be a nice wedding and a good deal of gold within 12 years of your career.<p>To know how far those people who started their careers in the IT industry in 90&#x27;s are, many are settled in the US. Many own 2-3 homes in a city like Bangalore drawing insane rent income, Many own stock options worth money you have never heard of. You can talk of Mars mission, pride and all that. But when you see your college mate driving a Honda Accord and eating a 3000 rupee dinner with his family after spending another 2000 on a movie on a Sunday evening. You begin to realize money has its own importance in life.<p>Working in Government firms went out of fashion as early as mid 90&#x27;s.",1411618444

We were not allowed to take any instrument inside of that room. So there were no photos. May be that is the reason for this perception, it is just bad PR.

Let&#x27;s say a single mother living in section-8 housing with limited job prospects who is already driving a really old car and who found one job 20 miles away in an area with no transit. That&#x27;s pretty bad, and it represents failures of our system at multiple levels. First I would propose spending government time to address those core issues before burning time on this symptom.

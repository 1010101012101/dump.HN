After that, haggling over term sheets.  After that, lawyers.  After that, money.  After that, we actually have to build and grow a business (the hard part-- most of the funded companies will likely fail).<p>In short, the jury is still out-- and will be for years. ;-)",1205909968

do a startup if it will make you happy.  Some people are only truly happy when they're challenged as thoroughly as only running your own business can be.  But don't just assume it's for you based on how cool it seems.",1205909859

All types of engineers are in the best position right now because everyone is desperate for more good engineers.  Not just from the explosion of software engineering but also from all the baby boomer mechanical, chemical, and civil engineers on the verge of retirement.",1205909361

Bridge of Birds is a lyrical fantasy novel. Set in ""an Ancient China that never was"", it stands with The Princess Bride and The Last Unicorn as a fairy tale for all ages, by turns incredibly funny and deeply touching. It won the World Fantasy Award in 1985, and Hughart produced two sequels: The Story of the Stone, and Eight Skilled Gentlemen. All present the adventures of Master Kao Li, a scholar with ""a slight flaw in [his] character"", and Lu Yu, usually called Number Ten Ox, his sidekick and the story's narrator. Number Ten Ox is strong, trusting, and pure of heart; Master Li once sold an emperor shares in a mustard mine, because ""I was trying to win a bet concerning the intelligence of emperors.""<p>Number Ten Ox comes from a village in which the children have been struck by a mysterious illness. He recruits Master Li to find the cure and comes along to provide muscle. They seek a mysterious Great Root of Power, which may be a form of ginseng. Of course, nothing turns out to be as simple as it seems; great wrongs must be avenged and lovers separated must be reunited, from the most humble to the highest. And even in the midst of cosmic glory, Pawnbroker Fang and Ma the Grub are picking the pockets of their own lynch mob, who are frozen in awe and wonder.",1205908726

Unfortunately I can't apply.<p>I thought about another idea that would work for me though and might be fun and helpful for you.<p>I think you guys should also have a virtual guest hacker stay at the house. Setup some sort of video chat and the virtual guest hacker would hang out virtually and you could trade ideas and do the same type of hanging out except the shared pizza/ramen. I'd do the same type of selection process and maybe limit it to a day or a week. You might even get some famous hackers to hang out. You might consider targeting the profile of the guest hacker too. There are specific steps that need to be done along the path to success. Why not try to get the hacker of the week that has experience doing what your working on. It could also generate some buzz if you do it right.",1205908606

I might suggest just jumping into a master's program to skip a lot of the cruft that comes with undergraduate programs.  They might make you take some undergraduate courses, but only the really important ones - And the graduate courses you take will be hard, but you'll learn a lot from them.  I'm doing something similar but in applied math.  (i have a degree in engineering).  I have a friend who studied physics as an undergrad and is now getting a masters in CS.  They made him take a few undergraduate courses, putting him back a semester, but he doesn't have to wade through the full undergraduate curriculum.<p>Oh. And only take 3 courses/semester as a grad. student.  You actually have a chance to learn it all thoroughly.",1205906723

The layoffs began last year since some banks and retails decided to process themselves, trying to cut costs. The truth is that the recession hit the credit industry and therefore hit our market.<p>The problem is that even though I'm single and I have no children I give to my parents some financial aid. So at least I have to earn some money to support them (it's not a huge amount BTW).<p>I've been working (in parallel) for my startup since 2007 and although this is a kind of a disaster to me, I could survive three months with the severance compensation and without a job. So I will devote all my ""leisure time"" on my startup. And now I'm finishing the design of the UI and I'm starting to code the app (I'm not a programmer), so it's the right moment.<p>Well,I feel very optimistic but the sad truth is that now I'm vulnerable to some threats (health problems for example). So looking for another job is an issue to me too but I don't want to waste all my time in interviews and in all that corporate crap.<p>So I can say that this financial orgy did hit me.<p>Best Regards.<p>PS: I can give some advice about credit cards (Visa, MC and Amex) if you need it.",1238455833

Note I was way to young for even a driver's license but that didn't stop me from planning out for when I was old enough to roll (aka Weird Al - White & Nerdy)<p>Anyway, I created my first PCB in autocad and took it out into the garage for etching...<p>""Hmmm  I needed something to pour the etching acid into...  Something that I could throw away when I'm done... Ah! This pie tin will work out nicely!""<p>So I took the pie tin and placed it on the surface of my Dad's table saw and then placed my unetched PCB in the tin.  Then next step of course was to pour the acid in the tin......<p>$%^&<i></i>!!!!!<p>The acid reacted violently with the metal of the tin and within seconds the bottom of the tin was completed digested by the acid which then proceeded to flow out of the tin, onto the table saw, and then all over the garage floor.<p>To this day, the table saw still has a rusty look to it and there is a nice brown stain in the concrete.<p>My career as a ""EE"" was founded on pure genius!",1238455001

If you consider such actions to be a net negative for the society, you are a part of the problem.<p>I do not disagree with you on principle and your proposal has some merit. The thing is that advertising/marketing dicussion is much more multifaceted and complex than HN collective mind portrays it to be:  &quot;advertising bad! mmkay?&quot;. The nuances and the opportunities to enact meaningful, real change in the advertising ecosystem are lost when rational discourse is suppressed by claims like &quot;99% of advertisers are bad&quot;. Good actors should be rewarded and bad should be discouraged economically. By lumping all of them in the bad bucket, you are encouranging detrimental behaviour.<p>Harmful,intrusive,obnoxious advertising is a symptom, not a disease. You can&#x27;t get rid of such ads without changing the underlying structure of socioeconomic reality, at least for limited cluster of audience.",1422881901

This release looks like a stopgap to get the best of the old WebKit line, but calling it 2.0 seems a bit shortsighted -- 2.0 should be kept for the WebEngine series if/when it happens.",1422879181

F/OSS fan that I am, I still think the same opportunities will exist whether Windows runs on a particular piece of hardware or not. After all, GNU/Linux and BSD have flourished despite Windows running on the same hardware for the past 30 years. How is this any different? I see it as opening up new channels for learning, not closing them off.<p>To look at it another way, this is similar to Microsoft being late to the party on modern smartphones. The existence of Windows Phone 7 and 8 has done absolutely nothing to slow down the explosion of popularity in Android and iOS phones.<p>I don&#x27;t foresee a huge percentage of Raspberry Pi owners jumping ship to Windows 10; maybe dabbling with it but that&#x27;s it.

This then would cause the interest in other platforms to dwindle, as people would flock to what they know. Here also the EET mantra could come into play again, by offering features not available to other platforms.<p>They need a foothold in other hardware, most likely for the coming of Internet Of Things.<p>It makes business sense for them to increase their reach, but don&#x27;t think that equals Microsoft being fond of Open-Source.",1422878798
8983779,comment,8980387,8981777,0,0,latk,,,"Perl5 has a lot of historical baggage that makes certain things difficult to do efficiently. For example, how objects work. There is an insane amount of indirection involved for a simple method call, and this indirection can&#x27;t generally be removed if we want Perl5 to stay highly backwards-compatible. Numerics aren&#x27;t particularly efficient either. Perl5&#x27;s opcodes are very high-level. That makes each individual opcode pretty fast, but makes it difficult to inline stuff. Variables can have “magic” attached that can change their semantics substantially. While this is very flexible and allows to do some amazing things, this also requires this magic to be checked on each access. So Perl5 has a lot of features that rank high on “clever”, but low on “can be optimized”. Perl5 never got JIT support, and only has a couple of very experimental Perl-to-C transpilers.<p>What is fast is string handling and log mangling. Perl was created for that; everything else is bolted on.",1422878771

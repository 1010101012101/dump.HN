114759,comment,114501,114501,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"We've been going back and forth on whether or not to use S3 and EC2.<p>At the moment we're only planning on using EC2 for computationally expensive tasks like generating thumbnails, PDFs, and that sort of thing.<p>We might use S3 for storage of large files, but probably not small frequently accessed ones because of the per-request charges and latency.<p>We're going to try to build an architecture that's not tied to one particular hosting method... we could start out on EC2 and if it doesn't work out then move to dedicated boxes. And even then if there's a particularly heavy load we could fire up additional EC2 instances.<p>The nice thing about EC2 is it's pretty easy to experiment. There's no big up-front costs with setting it up, so there's not too much to lose by testing.",1202895985
114758,comment,114198,114198,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"I gave up TV and computer games about two years ago.  The first was easy, the second was harder.  The way to do it is just to have a lot of creative projects on the go.  In my case it was a start-up and a band, but it could be anything.  As soon as you start creating, you get way more sucked in than you ever do with TV.<p>The only tricky part is finding something to keep your mind occupied when you're eating.  Reading leaps to mind.",1202895953
114757,comment,114310,114310,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"We are bootstrapping and I find it really helps.  You get a higher thought-to-work ratio, which means you can more often work out whether an idea is good or bad before pouring away development time into it.<p>The downside is the frustration of not being able to work on your true passion all the time.  But I would say this is a common problem for salaried employees.<p>However, once we start cranking out code, I think going full time will make us much more productive than continuing to bootstrap.",1202895579

Great point regarding the security by obscurity in resumes.<p>If I get a chance I might write a script to search the web for publicly accessible resumes and track changes in keywords over time.

114748,comment,113966,114698,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I agree. Hiring a sales team takes money so it's harder than doing something yourself. But once you have a solid sales team (and a solid support team) being agile can help. Large customers always demand new features and being able to rapidly provide what they're looking for is bound to make them happy (and make or break a deal). Once you build a happy customer base the referrals can bring you tons of business.<p>But I guess you can't take on this kind of work without some serious VC funding which makes it less attractive (you loose control and potential exits).",1202894411

But as far as I can tell controls like the Yahoo UI Rich Text Editor are implemented in pure Javascript. And by this I mean it modifies the DOM in Javascript (and the browser handles rendering the updated DOM) as opposed to using browser magic (like an ActiveX control in IE). If I'm wrong, could someone please point me to documentation explaining exactly how these RTE's are implemented?",1202893688

In the meantime SliceHost continues to serve us well for a fraction of the cost.",1202893641

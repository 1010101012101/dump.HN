2660532,comment,2656570,2658314,1,0,derleth,,,"""Beware the Turing Tarpit, where everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy."" -- Alan Perlis<p>C++ is, for many people, a Turing Tarpit: Ask yourself why you wouldn't write something in assembly, and that's why they wouldn't write it in C++.<p>In specific, C++ doesn't have built-in support for real garbage collection. This means a lot of the idioms I take for granted in languages like Common Lisp and Haskell, to pick two very different languages that have true gc in common, are effectively impossible in C++.<p>For example, I can't reliably pass complex data structures around using function composition (think f(g(h(x)))) because I can't rely on them <i>existing</i> from one function call to the next; an allocation may have failed somewhere up the line and now what? Adding in all the code needed to handle that isn't just a pain, it obscures the algorithm to the point I'm not programming the same way anymore. I'm not even <i>thinking</i> the same way anymore.<p>Now for a purely personal anecdote: I quite like C. I can do certain things in C about as fast as I can think of them (mostly, things involving the POSIX API and no really complex data structures). I occasionally get the notion to add some C++ to my bag of tricks; not C-With-Classes, but C++ with Boost and the STL and whatever else g++ can handle these days. I might as well learn to swim by jumping in 500 feet upstream of Niagara Falls; there's ""hitting the ground running"", there's ""hitting the ground doing back-flips and double-somersaults"", and then there's ""hitting the ground juggling sharpened sabres and gently convincing hungry wolves to not eviscerate you."" Honestly, it wasn't this hard to learn how to write macros in Common Lisp. I don't know if the problem is just me or if it really is that bizarre in C++-land.",1308214389

This is great, as there is zero sign of a TV when using the room to eat, receive guests, work or read.<p>This was a practicality at first, but now I <i>love</i> it. It's dead simple to convert the whole space into a movie theater, but you have to actually <i>initiate</i> that mode switch.  It's quite different than coming home and sitting down in a room which is already oriented around a TV (where I would end up watching TV even though that wasn't my intention).<p>Similarly, no cable connection means we have to be proactive about what content we'd like to consume.  Nearly all Dutch TV shows can be streamed online, US shows and movies we like are downloaded ahead of time.<p>Result: I'm just as likely to read a book as watch TV when I come home, when I do watch it's always something I chose, and none of the time spent watching involves any commercials.",1308213835

I enjoy Vim and I'm definitely more productive using all those household keystroke shortcuts without having to move my fingers too much around. Really, everyone should try Vim once in their lives.<p>But there's something weird that happens to me whenever I adventure myself into a longer or smarter key combination that does a lot for little (ie. a macro). My mind will actually figure out the correct sequence quickly (< 1s) and fire it up... but then, after accomplishing my goal, I freeze during ~5s with a strange, contemplative doze in my face.

I think that not intervention and human relief/asylum/evacuation are the ways to deal with international problems.<p>I prefer a loosely integrated system where it's hard for anyone group to gain control. This requires decentralization & a lack of strong international organizations.<p>I'd like to note, that I'm interested in stability & corruption - worst case scenarios, etc.  If you have anything you recommend that addresses those issues I'd like to read it.  And lastly, I'd like to quote milton friedman: ""One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.""",1308212198

It's seems like a flaw but not a massive security vulnerability.<p>Also Paypal also doesn't appear to verify email addresses on registration so anyone can create multiple accounts for the same person without any need to click a confirmation link in a verification email.

I had my main source of income disappear overnight twice.<p>Once was when 5 chargebacks came in on one day early in a month from a set of 5 credit card payments made by a single scammer; that put my account over some chargeback percentage level allowed by my merchant account provider and they terminated me on the spot after years of service. I had to ask dozens of customers with monthly subscriptions to sign up again with another payment provider, not all of them did.<p>The second time Google decided it would no longer allow AdWords ads for an entire category of (perfectly legal, non-scammy) services and suspended all ads in that category, including mine.

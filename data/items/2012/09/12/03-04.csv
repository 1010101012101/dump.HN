Once you've learned enough to build a prototype, and are actually on your way or have created an MVP, you've indicated a) that you're serious about this project, b) whether it's viable going forward, and c) that you're not a complete technical neophyte. Most importantly, you've flipped the script to a certain extent -- you can now be selective about who you choose to work with, and you've qualified yourself enough to be an arbiter of quality.<p>Just my two cents. I can understand why the developers here might hesitate to work with someone who hasn't proven that he's willing to put in the work. But on the other hand, if you're a serious non-technical co-founder, I'm not convinced it's a great idea to just pick the first developer who's willing to work with you. Seems like a recipe for disaster.",1347422376

The limitation was precisely the latitude of the plates when exposed to light which had been band-pass filtered to allow red, green and blue light to pass.  What the precise details of those filters and the respective sensitivity of the plates to those spectra are, I can't say.  Obviously it was panchromatic or we wouldn't have a red channel.<p>Here's an image which shows how snugly the sRGB color space fits within the real of visual perception.  \n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colorspace.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colorspace.png</a><p>It sure is cozy in there.<p>What we have in front of us is still an approximation of the colors of nature and that we can perceive.<p>Here's some samples of fluorescent paint<p><a href=""http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/color/fluorescent/fluor.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goldenpaints.com/products/color/fluorescent/fluor...</a><p>Now I don't know anything the history of fluorescent paint and whether it was around in Prokudin-Gorksy's lifetime.  But I know for certain he could have seen it if it had and noticed its intensity.<p>I hope you notice that the photographs of the paint on the website are not themselves fluorescent.  This is because we can perceive colors that the screen can't show, even if you have the latest Cinema Display.<p>Also, go online and look up some gold or copper.  Then look at the real thing.  Good luck getting the computer to produce that color.<p>Fact is, producing these colors is hard, and done with spot color when printing.  That doesn't make it outside the realm of perception.<p>What you're basically arguing is that the film couldn't have possibly captured the colors we see here, and that they were invented by the restoration process.<p>So, I'll ask again for quantification.  This is the digital realm we're discussing.  What I'm not asking for is the quantification of taste or feeling, or even of perception, in spite of this discussion.  There are so hard numbers underneath all of this.  It would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of the same image with the pixels that are impossible in this alleged early 20th century color space highlighted.<p>However, I think you've successfully moved the goalposts past what we are capable of knowing directly.  By alleging that these 16-bit TIFF grayscale images created in the scanning process are themselves heavily manipulated, we have come to a stopping point.  There's no way I can get my hands on the originals in order to ascertain whether you are correct.   (However note that the images were scanned is grayscale, perhaps using sGray as the color model, is it the fact that you also assert that sGray contains more colors than Prokudin-Gorksy could have perceived or captured on his plates?)<p>Aside from your clever dismissal of the ""original"" as far as we are able to obtain it, the 16-bit color-separated TIFFs, is it possible at all to bring these images into a computer and respect their original ""limited"" nature and bring that presentation to a computer screen?  Because if it is not, then what is the point?<p>Your assertion that we are in love with Photoshop, not the work itself is basically moot.  What you are offering up as an explanation of the compelling content of the work is in fact so commonplace as to encompass all of digital media.  The powers granted Photoshop in this discussion to smudge the original color working space into realms impossible in the original are in fact so pervasive that to draw them out in this discussion is merely an excuse to talk about your pet theories about digital media and have nothing whatever to do with this work under discussion.",1347422361

But the words, as they are written, as a counter argument fail.  And by that, I mean his over-broad statement you are replacing with another overbroad statement.  What is left, lacks the resolution to differentiate.  There is no insight into what makes a good X.<p>One thing that does make a good X is talent scouting, and being a mentor to a professional going through a rapid growth/maturity curve.  There is an art to finding talent and building relationships.  There is an art to segueing those relatinships to finding the right fit for talent Z within the developmet system.  Art dealers or A&R reps have similar dynamics, its not particular to sport.<p>So, while this was latent information, it is much more powerful and interesting to determinig the performance of X than your proposed alternate formulation (""think of them as [...]""). The baby goes out with the bathwater.<p>Institutional investors as a class are not expert at all in this.  Institutional investors as a class talent spot from 3-5 top MBA programs.  Institutional investors as a class know about working <i>in the system</i>.  They may or may not know shit about running a company, disrupting the system, shoestring budget, etc.  In general, VCs are not like Institutional Investors as a class. The parts that are similar are hidden from the day to day workings of the founders, etc.<p>Where you do have merit, however, is in <i>benchmarking</i> perfomance returns.  In that case, IIs as a class are relevant.  So, ignoring how you generate returns.  How big do they need to be to propogate the Firm?  You can measure that.  But in reality, This is just a threshold metric. Theres not much insight to this. Its not the feasible upper bound if you are studying that, etc. 20% after everything annualized? GTG.<p>Though in context here, this is not totally irrelevant.  So in maths, you might say...how many 10,000x do I need if threshold is only 1.2^n? Etc.  Its not clear only one strategy is either feasible or optimal, etc.<p>But: a strategy can be set in theory to reach 1.2^n.<p>How do you know the probability of achieving it? If you don't understand the interdynamics of the strategy with the day to day of what makes a good X and <i>what I can execute on</i> as X at threshold probability...you're in trouble.  And if you don't know what makes a good X...thats a problem.<p>And so combine: Path X and Prob X = expected return.<p>So, to understand Vc you need to understand this problem.  PGs post talked alot about this.  What is the path and what is the probability to sucess. What do those data look like? what are the hurdles? What are the characteristics of the athletes, etc.<p>[And for the avoidance of doubt, this is not an opinion on any one strategy or the other, or which of the essays was better, etc.  This is how to think about frameworks with enough resolution to be useful for thinking clearly].<p>____________",1347422199

Ichiro came from Japan instead of the traditional draft/Latin America -> minor leagues route, but considering the Mariners paid $13M just for the rights to negotiate with him, he wasn't exactly an ugly duckling by the time he came over.<p>Really, all those guys are more like a phenomenally successful startup than not. There are countless prospects in sportsthis is most obvious in baseball with the huge minor league pro leagues, in basketball the NCAA serves a similar roleand only a very, very few of those players turn out to be stars. And frequently scouting for them in advance (like at the HS level) is a crapshoot. If you were an up-and-coming agent and happened to land a Nash, Ichiro, or Iverson, he'd likely be worth more to you than all your other clients combined.",1347421060

Strategically, I was under the impression that Facebook was positioning itself to be a third independant force, alongside Apple and Google. Considering the state of play when facebook started up in 2006, when users flooded into the browser venue, and where the iPhone hadn't yet been released, and where the idea of socially contextualless search and data could be leveraged and superseded by the Facebook social graph, I consider the decisions made with facebooks mobile strategy to be explicable.<p>There was, after all, a lot of rumour that Facebook would release their own phone. This made sense if your objective is to provide an alternative to mobile OS's, and even more, to overtake your competitors. The belief including the possibility of evolutionary superiority.<p>Things change. Google supplies Chrome through the app store despite the restrictions imposed by Apple, and this has not weakened the power of Google at the expense of Apple. There are many examples of stepwise cooperation.  It has not diminished their independance. And Facebook likewise should probably not have been so concerned that acquiescing to the other majors on mobile would pidgeon hole them as a very very big Instagram style dependant.<p>Facebook has lost time by being over guarded in my view. On the other hand, this admission by facebook demonstrates a recognition of a kind of failure. I suspect the notion that Facebook will grow to be an organisation that is an evolutionary step beyond Google is now viewed as the real strategic error by them.<p>As to HTML5 being a mistake, I could be wrong, but I don't really think that that's what he actually means. He's trying to explain himself without admitting some things.",1347420936

He just laughed, but I could tell he enjoyed the irony too.<p>The Linux Foundation handles the Linux kernel, so they have a good track record in that regard. They also have worked on some less-successful (but very well-managed) initiatives like Meego and now Tizen.<p>The members are big corporations and as a result, the auditing process and outlay of funds isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d be concerned with.<p>The greater (potential) concern would be over how the corporate sponsors could influence a project. Zemlin assured me that the SOP is not to interfere with existing operational structures or governances of a project -- so they wouldn&#x27;t have any impact on how the OSF is run, for instance -- and certainly, in the case of the Linux kernel, corporate sponsorship hasn&#x27;t dictated Linus&#x27;s direction of the project.<p>That said, I think the level of influence a corporation could have over a project is probably directly related to how a project is initially structured. Tizen, as an example, is in partnership with the Linux Foundation, but is largely led by Samsung and Intel. That&#x27;s totally fine, and was that way by design.<p>I would be concerned about projects that might not have strong leaders (like Linus). Of course, one could argue that if that&#x27;s the case, the project might have bigger problems than being co-opted by other entities.",1398351209

I 100% agree.<p>I know you didn&#x27;t say this, but I do think its important to dispel the notion that this is somehow a &quot;response&quot; to LibreSSL. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s not; the two initaitives started in parallel. The Linux Foundation started reaching out to companies to join them in supporting projects that are important and not necessarily visible -- starting with OpenSSL -- at the same time the LibreSSL project was starting.<p>When I asked Jim Zemlin (Linux Foundation executive director) about LibreSSL yesterday, he wasn&#x27;t familiar enough with the project -- but was certainly open to the idea of all projects working together (or even having CII support something like LibreSSL if it had the type of adoption that would make it a core part of the open web).<p>Even if this project had been in place when Theo and the OpenBSD guys forked OpenSSL, I still think they would have forked it and started LibreSSL. After all, they have their own ideas about crypto and security and their own plans for how to  run a project.<p>And even assuming LibreSSL can become a true drop-in replacement for all existing OpenSSL installations (which I truly doubt), that doesn&#x27;t mean it will. Look at MySQL vs. MariaDB. Maria is finally gaining default status in important projects, but it&#x27;s hardly replaced MySQL and realistically speaking, it probably won&#x27;t.<p>So even if you want to argue that LibreSSL is going to do a better job with fixing OpenSSL&#x27;s flaws (which may or may not be true), the reality is, OpenSSL is not going to go away.<p>Given that reality, doesn&#x27;t it make sense to at least have the biggest stakeholders in the project offer it support so that the small dev team can stop with the contract work and work on making OpenSSL better?",1398350484

If the package isn&#x27;t included in Arch&#x27;s binary repos, the &quot;yaourt&quot; command will build the package (often from git) via a user-contributed script. You can set the make options to Gentoo&#x27;s suggested -march for your CPU, and build really optimized packages. I&#x27;m experiencing <5 second boot times, lower RAM usage, and snappier WINE/WineASIO performance.<p>Before installing Arch, I was a die-hard Kubuntu/KXstudio[2] user. Now I have the ability to build all the KXstudio packages from git (Cadence, Carla, and Claudia make JACK the greatest thing ever), without all the Ubuntu/Debian cruft underneath.<p>Another benefit (post-snowden) is that Arch is not an incorporated entity in any of the &quot;Five Eyes&quot; countries. Julian Assange has come out to publicly state knowledge of intentional flaws being added to both Open Source/Free Software projects, and specifically namedrops Debian as compromised. The threat vectors one should analyze are which governments would have access to which corporations. RedHat is a registered corporation in Delaware, USA. Canonical is registered in City of London. If one pays attention to Moxie Marlinspike&#x27;s convergence demo at DEFCON 19, you can see how it&#x27;d be trivial for a government agency such as GCHQ/CCSE/NSA to spoof Canonical&#x27;s or RedHat&#x27;s SSL certificates. Gentoo and Arch have no corporate influences, and thus are the only relatively safe Linux distributions left, IMO.<p>So, AUR, Advanced customization, and potentially increased security are bigger reasons, for me, to switch to Arch than pacman.<p>1. <a href=""http://aur.archlinux.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aur.archlinux.org</a><p>2. <a href=""http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net</a>",1398350452

7640493,comment,7637302,7638163,5,0,egmil,,,"Hi,<p>gcr makes a number of excellent points here. I completely agree about the human performance comments. Human performance on LFW is 99.2%.  While some people claim this is &quot;not fair&quot; because it includes some background of the picture, this is the way the benchmark has been defined. There is no universally accepted way to define the face verification problem, and when we built LFW we chose to define the task on these images (without cropping them closely). Not surprisingly human performance goes down when the images are cropped more closely to the face. My response to people who say that it is unfair to use the whole image is &quot;go ahead and write a program which takes advantage of the whole image!&quot;<p>I have not read the paper carefully yet, so I cannot comment on the technical content. However, people have raised the question of why it&#x27;s not yet on the LFW results page. First of all, we don&#x27;t put up results until we received the results file from the authors yet, and we haven&#x27;t received such a file yet, so of course the results are not up yet. Second, even if we receive results files from an author, we require that the paper either be published in a peer-reviewed  conference or journal, or, alternatively, that if it is commercial, that an executable be available so that the system can be tried by other experimenters. If we are sent results from a paper that has been accepted but not yet published we sometimes show the results on our results page, but highlight it in red to show that the paper is forthcoming.<p>Additionally, Gary Huang, who does a fantastic job maintaining the LFW site, is redoing the entire results page to better present the information, and so results may experience a short delay while we are working on the new page.<p>One interesting thing to note about methods that are getting very high accuracy rates on LFW is that they typically use enormous amounts of outside training data (like the recent DeepFace method by FaceBook researchers). Part of the purpose of our reorganization of the results page is to highlight better the differences between methods that use outside data and those that use only the LFW training data.<p>The community should remember that a K-nearest neighbor classifier is <i>the best possible classifier</i> for <i>any supervised learning problem</i> when you have enough training data (as proven by Stone, 1977). Thus, it shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising that many different methods work very well when given massive training sets. We saw the same thing back in the 90&#x27;s with the MNIST data set.<p>I agree with gcr that moving to new data sets makes sense, although performance on LFW with limited training data may continue to be interesting for some time.<p>-Erik Learned-Miller",1398350162

7640476,comment,7638731,7639099,3,0,JonFish85,,,"> One interesting thing about the high valuations of tech startups now is where the money is coming from. It&#x27;s not stock markets.<p>See, I think that it <i>is</i> coming from the stock markets.  These valuations are there because the investors think that they can dump the stock onto the market for above that amount.  Look at KING--investors in KING knew that the jig was up, they dumped it onto the stock market and got out.<p>$10bn valuations are possible <i>because</i> of the public markets.  If the investors weren&#x27;t extremely optimistic that the stock market will eventually buy their stock for more than that valuation, they wouldn&#x27;t do the investing.  That&#x27;s the only time they&#x27;ll get their money back.  Make no mistake: they&#x27;re (VCs) not in it to keep it private and to keep the profits to themselves.  They&#x27;re in it to take it public or get bought by someone even bigger.  That&#x27;s all it is.<p>The stock market is their end-game, and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re targeting with these investments.

VCs manage money for those guys, along with pensions and other enormous concentrations of capital.<p>What you want are equity stakes (control) of productive assets. The cash that you use for that is not that useful except to normal suckers like you and I who need to hand over a bunch of paper tickets every month to the landlord, the grocer, and the government. The guys who issue the tickets are generally above those concerns, but they still need to get a return on their capital.<p>I would rather own stock than a pile of green tickets. Stock is, again, just another kind of ticket, but they&#x27;re more expensive tickets that grant you rights to a productive asset. It is a safe bet to dump your green tickets into speculation because, while the speculation may work out, you know for a fact that those tickets are going to depreciate.<p>You will not see interest rates go up if the Fed can help it, because to do so would provoke an immediate fiscal crisis. Bubbles result from rational allocations of funds based on a certain set of assumptions. It is a good assumption that the US government will not permit rates to rise as long as there is zero public appetite for a major reduction in government spending. Once that reality changes, the structures that rely upon that environmental state will either need to adapt or will fail.<p>Startup-land is a greenhouse arrangement that thrives so long as the temperature remains high. When the guy who owns the greenhouse cuts the power, most of those plants are gonna die. If you want to be resilient to that risk, you must leave the hothouse. However, the hothouse plants have a lot more access to capital in the near term, so it is rough to compete with them directly. That is the trouble with bubbles: you can&#x27;t really escape their effects by being &#x27;prudent,&#x27; because low interest rates make prudence imprudent.<p>In order to raise rates, the US would probably have to either confiscate a lot of assets (which would harm its international status as the cleanest dirty shirt), raise taxes, raise retirement ages, implement means testing on medicare + social security, and cut military pensions/VA expenses. There is no real solution that does not involve provoking some sort of major crisis, so it is much easier for everyone to keep the carnival going as long as possible until something snaps internationally. The federal government can&#x27;t afford even a slight rise in rates without having an immediate cash flow crisis.",1398349891

This conspiracy which is clear to most interlectuals would easily be dismissed due to source alone and to panda towards such poor information is to me and many a sign of weakness, again non conducive towards stable manager.<p>Anybody who is easily lead by such a clear conspiracy is also the type to be in denial of the facts as indicated by this post about not understanding why a sacked employee did not jump thru hoops out of hours later on.  We see it, anybody reading it see&#x27;s it and she did not until after it went viral and enough comments enabled reality to set in that she eventualy realised her mistake and instead of admitting it, she just deleted it and pretended it never happened.<p>That is the relevance, and indicative that for some this person is not very credible.  Employers go thru social media all the time and way it against you, it works both ways.<p>No witch hunt, rememebr this is instigated by her, everybody is just stating the obvious that she failed too see and then when she did, delete/denaial mode. no witch hunt, just trying to understand the type of person who would make such a post in the first place and if it was out of character or indicative of there mindset.<p>But any debate can be deemed a witchhunt, just does not distract from the facts.

The whole &quot;movement&quot; against systemd seems to be &quot;this is very different than the way we used to do things!&quot; Of course it is; computing has changed a lot in the last 30 years since sysvinit was designed. We now care about things like power management, hot-plug devices, etc. and the only way to ensure a consistent method of handling them is to have a single control point. The kernel is also a single point of failure by necessity; so it&#x27;s well audited and a lot of work goes into making sure it is rock-solid. Because systemd is now the de-facto heir to sysvinit due to its inclusion in almost every major distro, I suspect it will get the same level of care and oversight.<p>A lot of these complaints boil down to the fact that systemd is a single point of control for a lot of different functions.

7640297,comment,7640074,7640074,18,0,exratione,,,"For my money the nuclear DNA damage angle is actually the more interesting part of this. The research community has for some years been debating whether or not stochastic nuclear DNA damage is important in aging outside of the issue of cancer. The consensus educated assumption has long been to think of course, nuclear DNA damage should lead to loss of protein homeostasis, and is therefore a meaningful contributing cause of aging, not just of raised risk of cancer. However there is nowadays plenty of evidence to support the opposite view, that the levels of stochastic nuclear mutations seen in human tissues really don&#x27;t matter over the present human life span. Other than cancer.<p>This would be good if it continues to hold up. The less we have to fix in order to produce a first generation of treatments that effectively treat aging - i.e. produce rejuvenation - the better. Fixing nuclear DNA damage is going to be plausible via global DNA editing technologies like CRISPR, but we&#x27;re a long way from doing it for all genes to restore to a template and erase damage. Cancer therapies on the other hand are going to improve enormously in the near future as forms of narrowly targeted cell destruction take over from the present standards of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, coupled with greatly improved early detection. If you&#x27;re 20-40 years away from peak cancer age in a wealthy region of the world, then I don&#x27;t think your odds of dying from cancer are very large at all.",1398348105

Before that I had a (dynamic) ipv4. My cable provider sits on ipv4 addresses and won&#x27;t jump from providing cable in Germany into the huge Indian/Chinese market and run out of addresses.<p>Why do we allocate huge networks (was it a /10 recently?) to Akamai if we&#x27;re scarce?<p>No way to access my home machines anymore. Dyndns is dead. I could implement that for ipv6 and that would be even better in theory, alas .. most people/networks/mobile carriers are on ipv4. So my AAAA is utterly useless, even if I keep it up to date.<p>In the end I&#x27;m a fan of ipv6. I ran ipv6 tunnels in the past, native ipv6 is cool. Somewhat. CGNAT is bullshit for the reasons above and more and forcing it down to your customers is a tough sell (-> The ISP loses goodwill here). For new or exploding markets? Probably no other way. Here it&#x27;s just useless. Dual Stack is fine, DS Lite causes trouble again and again in my setup here.<p>And there&#x27;s never an excuse for a known issue that requires your customers to unplug the cable modem you provided, because .. well .. it&#x27;s not quite ipv6 ready yet. [1]<p>1: That was an issue for month, was solved around end of February. Support hotline knew about it, device manufacturer knew about it, official workaround see above.",1398348095

And I mean that very literally. Oldest Unices only worked on systems where all the hardware was brought up on boot, before the rest of the system. Then hotplug was added on top of this. Init systems didn&#x27;t evolve to accommodate this, instead different systems were developed to handle it. However, the Linux kernel has constantly evolved towards <i>eliminating</i> old-style static boot, with right now, on normal bootup, almost all devices are hotplugged. This is why sysvinit doesn&#x27;t work properly anymore. Being hotplug capable is definately the init system&#x27;s job.",1398348021

How did this happen?\n2.  How can we stop this from happening again?<p>LibreSSL and openSSLRampage is the OpenBSD response, and, it&#x27;s absolutely in keeping with their character.  I admire the &quot;Fuck it, let&#x27;s just fix this shit&quot; attitude that goes along with it.<p>The Core Infrastructure Initiative is the Linux Foundation&#x27;s  response.<p>They&#x27;re two valid ways of dealing with the problem.  the LibreSSL way is more direct, targetted, and, in a way, satisfying, especially if you run OpenBSD, and can gain from these efforts relatively quickly.<p>The &quot;Core Infrastructure Initiative&quot; is looking at it from a more holistic perspective and saying:  OK, OpenSSL was in trouble and nobody noticed, what other projects are in the same situation, and how can we prevent what happened to OpenSSL from happening to other projects.<p>Neither way is necessarily &quot;The only right way&quot;, or even better than the other way.  In fact, both approaches complement each other.  OpenBSD fixes the actual current problem child, Linux Foundation is on the hunt for the next problem child",1398348019

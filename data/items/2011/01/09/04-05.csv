2084854,comment,2084564,2084722,0,0,lanolin,,,"> ... but no-one can give me any logical reason why this is the case.<p>If you search the c.l.s archives, you can find the various reasons.<p>> I wish Scheme implementors would stop dragging their feet and implement R6RS already!<p>My limited understanding of the situation is as follows:<p>R6RS made it through the standards process even though a substantial number of implementors and practitioners weren't happy with it. Many refused to implement R6RS, or else ignored it, but some big players did implement it. After that, it was a stalemate for a while, with the community divided.<p>Then the current steering committee decided that this rift needed to be repaired. I think they saw that some Schemers wanted to keep Scheme small, while others wanted it to be more practical and include more ""batteries"". Read more about their conclusions and plans at <a href=""http://www.scheme-reports.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scheme-reports.org/</a> (strangely (or perhaps not so strangely?), I can't find a link to that site from schemers.org)...<p>The long and the short of it is, to reunite the community, the steering committee decided to define Scheme (R7RS) as a small core language (""wg1"") + a superset of features/libraries that most people are using in one way or another anyway (""wg2""). If an implementor only wants to implement wg1, then that's fine, and it's mostly like R5RS anyway. If they want to provide a full-featured batteries-included implementation, then they implement wg1 + wg2 (which will take the best and least controversial features from R6RS and probably also draw heavily from the SRFI's). This satisfies both the ""keep it small!"" faction and the ""we want more practical stuff included!"" faction.<p>As we speak, the R7RS wg1 and wg2 groups are working out the kinks for their respective proposals / public reports, with votes and discussions actively taking place. I think R7RS is going to have broad support and be rapidly adopted.",1294549012

At the time the graphics and 3d environments alone were the big selling point.<p>I remember playing that first version over a modem, and indeed there was no client prediction at all.  Not just shooting, but every single thing.  You press forward, wait 300ms before anything happens, you switch weapons, wait 300ms.  Even basic things like running and timing a jump over a small gap were extraordinarily difficult.  But it was still kind of fun for the novelty of it, at least until somebody on a T1 or ISDN joined at which point you simply died before you even saw the enemy (ie. you saw them before you saw yourself die, but by then you had in fact already died on the server).",1294548763

2084810,comment,2082505,2084621,0,0,quadhome,,,"I think I see where we're misunderstanding each other. The freedoms the GPL ensures aren't for the developer of the software; but, for the users of that software.<p>The point is that, from the perspective of your users-- your ""audience""-- they're running software somewhere out in the Internet. Where the GPL ensured (amongst other things) that they'd have access to the source of their local programs, the AGPL ensures they have access to the source of their remote programs.<p>From your perspective, this decreases your freedom as a developer because you're required to distribute your source code to your ""audience."" But, you have a simple recourse: don't use the AGPL!<p>wrt. the clickwrap EULA, I think the GPL and its variants have always been a set of terms and conditions. I don't know Stallman's arguments or what you're railing against; but, I will <i>guess</i> that his problem with clickwrap EULAs were that they limited how a user could personally <i>use</i> the software... or, worse, made other at-best tangentially related demands of them. The GPL and its variants do not limit your personal use, but rather constrain your ability to re-distribute the software.<p>wrt. the AGPL making users any less beholden due to the data silo effect, my position is that a program <i>isn't</i> intrinsically useless without a user's data... or even the developer's own custom data.<p>Consider a site like Facebook, where the primary value is in its network effects: anyone could open a competitor site that had feature parity. If the original site (Facebook) changed its policies in a way the userbase disliked, they could move to a competitor knowing the functionality would be the same.<p>Or, consider the GPL release of id software's old games. None of the assets are free. However, that didn't stop a huge ecosystem from springing up. Derivatives, alternate games, and the many thousands of people gaining an understanding of how to make a Real Game.",1294547525

A couple committed suicide, most had health problems, alcoholism, severe depression, drug additions, and the rest are today broken people on the inside who can't get through a simple phone call with their parents without breaking into sobbing tears after hanging up. <i>All</i> of them have spoken outwardly and quite vocally a wish for a Western upbringing, one that fostered creativity and the genesis of ideas - not conformance to a meaningless system of symbolic but useless achievements that have provided nothing in particular for their lives except the ability to get their parents to back off for a few minutes.<p>Where this woman makes a mistake is in assuming that outward, public success (yes, all of them work good jobs, and have fine educations) is the most important thing in life.<p>The question she has never thought to ask herself is ""so what?""

They don't make team lead, department head, business unit manager or any other mark of a successful corporate career. They toil away for 20 years in some anonymous cube, counting the minutes until quitting time everyday and then leaving for the day with nobody to say goodbye to.<p>This woman, while making good points about the need to push children to excellence (and the softness of modern Western concepts about child rearing and the overemphasis on false-self esteem), treats her kids like a psychopath.<p>Reasonable statements like ""What Chinese parents understand is that nothing is fun until you're good at it"" are then blasted into cookoo-land by a list of rules that are sure to turn her kids into social misfits, unfit to navigate a complex personal or professional life and succeed in it.<p>This part really stood out to me:\n""If a Chinese child gets a Bâ€”which would never happenâ€”there would first be a screaming, hair-tearing explosion.

Wherever you are, if you're a geek, you're going to be a geek. But if you're in a city, you, as a programmer, will be impacted in small ways, allowing you to create apps that are more ""social"".<p>The article covers a number of aspects and business is one. Maybe it ought to be clearer on the point of techies. My view is that techies are still essential to building solid apps but as we move in the ""social"" phase of the web, pure tech is not the only ingredient. There needs to be more in terms of user experience and in terms of understanding what social can be (as far as its potential). In order to do so, you need to be proactive about understanding the ""normals"". And opportunities to do so are higher in New York than they are in the valley.<p>If you're surrounded by hackers, you will get a good understanding of hacker culture. But it will make it that much more difficult to understand what a secretary or banker or model are interested in. So it makes it that much more difficult to create products that are appealing outside of hacker circles.<p>In New York, there isn't a choice in terms of learning about those other groups or not. We're all on top of each other so something as common as a subway ride creates some of that exposure.<p>The fallacy I'm trying to break through is that New York doesn't have hackers. It does and the number of hackers is growing. And that's the reason for the warning I'm sounding (because end of day, the article is not a triumphant call but rather a call for both sides to bring their best game).<p>NYC has a lot to learn from the valley in terms of fostering an engineering culture (its own engineering culture is just nascent) but the valley has a lot to learn about sectors outside of tech.<p>I respectfully disagree that the next Google or Facebook will come from a top tech school. In fact, I'd warrant that the founders of that next big deal company are currently at work in some place none of us could imagine (like who would think that a kid from the midwest would come up with a successful web browser.

He has no sense to pivot, no sense that maybe he needs to find a new calling in life and utilize his skills in another fashion.<p>Contrastingly, we knew another PhD in Chemistry from Cornell. He got out and hated academia, but still loved teaching. He decided to teach chem and physics at some fancy prep high school and is doing well for himself.<p>To me these people need to understand that if they can't find their place quickly to scale that pyramid need to find a more general use for their skills.<p>There's perseverance and then theres a false sense of hope.",1294546755

LLVM, which only even supports two platforms (although having seriously broken semi-support for ARM) is often stated to be ""catching up"" in correctness to gcc, but is not there yet. The opinion that LLVM is somehow epic is something you only hear from incredibly pro-Apple developers. I mean, even Apple's port of gcc explicitly chooses incorrect results occasionally for performance (an interesting specific case being ___divdc3).\n</code></pre>\nIn order to keep their user-base on Actionscript/Flash, Adobe was banking on LLVM to get Flash to work on iOS devices before they were legally restricted from doing so. With the lifting of the ban, Adobe can now deploy Flash-based code on iOS devices[1].

What's the use of a 1,000 houses in a town of 100 people?<p>Here's the source of the problem as I see it. The PhDs I know are largely risk intolerant and stay in academia because it's a comfortable way to pursue their passion. They're used to asking for permission and people evaluating them along very specific guidelines. When they enter the real or corporate world, they're used to this attitude of asking for permission to do things. They expect universities or corporations to find a use for their talent instead of architecting one themselves.<p>So what is their economic use? They need to figure that out.

However, It disturbs me when someone is interviewing me and they are looking for a particular answer and they consider everything else wrong. Even when I find more efficient answers, if it's not theirs, it's wrong.<p>Think about it like those little kid riddles: ""A man is found dead with a noose around his neck and a puddle of water at his feet. How is it he was killed?"" Put on a stool and the stool was removed? Then add the restriction ""There are no stools."" He was lifted with the rope? ""The rope was tied to a bar on the ceiling and couldn't be raised higher."" Raised in the air by some strong people and then let hang? ""No one raised him from the air."" You can make guesses all day long and I can make up excuses about why you're wrong until you finally guess what I wanted you to guess -- that he was standing on a block of ice.<p>More specific to your question: when I read it the first thing that came to mind was just to have an array of booleans and for each word in the table set H(word) to true and then when looking up a word check if H(word) is true. I don't know what bloom filters are, so I'm not saying this answer is better than them -- but after I suggest that instead of imposing some other restriction, ask me to think about what is wrong with my answer. Talk to me about the false-positives/false-negatives [or lack thereof]. Talk to me about what hash function I could use. Or about why I picked that way. Or what problems could happen if the hash function wasn't perfectly uniform.",1294545978

Those roles are often treated as second-class citizens within a development environment.  And even when development treats them well and allows them to really do their job, more general and senior management still sees them as second class citizens.<p>I'd ask for a detailed description of the types of work you will be doing, and seek your own self-assurance (whatever they tell you) that your development skills won't atrophy.<p>Moving from a QC/testing role to development can also be a hard sell.  Don't get stuck/typecast.<p>I suspect that, the larger the organization, the more true a lot of this is.  For one thing, QC/testing changes from being a few individual roles to its own entity, depending on the organizational structure.<p>If you can, spend some time networking with people in and about this kind of role.  If you can make some safe connections to people at the potential employer, all the better.  But also try to ascertain whether the move will have any negative career implications.

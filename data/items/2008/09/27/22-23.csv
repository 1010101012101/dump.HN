I want to be able to add a page designer to my site for my many thousands (or millions) of users. Or whatever I want. CushyCMS wants FTP/SFTP information for single site and it's not at all clear whether I can integrate it into my own site.",1222556226

317219,comment,317155,317155,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Personally, I have some concerns over this approach.<p>Google is a mediator between users and information. As such, it's really important to have and appear to have as little bias as possible - otherwise it taints the information that is coming through. To be effective as a tool, Google really needs to be transparent and impartial as possible. (See Google in China as a counterexample).<p>Also, I question how effective this approach would be. I'm not sure many people that oppose gay marriage would be swayed by Google's statement... I mean, Google has a strong brand, but I really doubt people will vote no because ""Google says so"" in the same way as they would with say, Oprah.<p>I think there are other advocacy paths that are more effective, and don't spend Google's brand/position in this way.",1222555750

So long as you don't write it with the dev kit, or want to deliver it via the AppStore and install it with iTunes, the sky's the limit.  Apple has the stranglehold on the platform/framework and the delivery mechanism.  They can use it however they want.<p>Now .. a nice startup idea might be an alternate delivery method from scratch.

That sounds like a great problem to have :)<p>The worst thing you can do with a VC, or with any potential client or partner, is to give them a bad experience.  ""Sorry, we don't need any money right now, but we'll keep you in mind,"" is a great answer.  ""Here's a half-baked business plan (or product) that even <i>we</i> don't like yet,"" is always a terrible answer.  ""Here's a good business plan, but we don't need any money so we're not really excited about proceeding,"" is pretty bad too.<p>Just brush them off nicely.  Take them to lunch for a chat if you want.  Make it clear you're not looking for funding right now, but you might be eventually, and you'd like to get their input right away.  Wouldn't you think it was great if a VC did that to you?",1222554075

317191,story,,,5,7,wheels,"Ask PG: How do you tell a VC you're not ready for them yet?",,"This is something we've hit a few times recently.  We've had a couple of full-on VCs approach us asking for more info.  German VCs tend to want to see a business plan, or at least that's what they always ask for.  We're writing one, but for some of our long term goals we've still got some research to do.<p>So, we're a bit up in the air.  The options seem to be:<p>- Divert resources away from development so that we can finish the business plan faster<p>- Divert resources away from rounding up customers so that we can finish the business plan faster<p>- Get a quick and dirty business plan together that ignores a lot of details for things more than a year out<p>- Tell VCs we're not ready to present to them yet<p>We're good on money for the next while, so there's no immediate need to start raising money, but this is a point that we debate internally, so I'd be interested in what Paul or others that have been down the fundraising route have to say here.  From Paul's essays he emphasizes ""keep working on your product"", but that seems to be an alternative to proactive fundraising.  It's a bit of a conundrum when they've come to us.",1222553458

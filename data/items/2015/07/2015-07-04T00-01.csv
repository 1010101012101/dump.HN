That is why the errors exist.<p>Having a self signed certificate isn&#x27;t an error in the encryption negotiation (fatal) but a policy error (non-fatal). In technical terms - there is nothing wrong with a self signed certificate preventing me from having an encrypted session.<p>> HTTP has no security connotation hence no issues.<p>I think you just pointed out the problem - HTTP shouldn&#x27;t exist at all - we should be migrating everything to HTTPS or some other protocol. I&#x27;m not sure letsencrypt is the answer - it might just turn into another non-maintained CA (see startssl).<p>> But it&#x27;s far from totally broken.<p>The simple fact that CAs can, and have, been compromised in the past proves they are broken. If a fraudulent certificate is signed - it doesn&#x27;t matter if is added to a CRL in 5 hours or 5 minutes - the bad guy has probably already used it to do damage. I&#x27;m not saying CAs are pointless - I&#x27;m advocating for a way to have a CA that is only allowed to sign certificates for certain domains - especially if I can be my own CA. Yes, I know that&#x27;s not the way it works now - but surely we can modify the infrastructure to allow this.",1435971587

In a sense serde is a compile time reflection library. It&#x27;s designed to recursively  walk through a structure while calling a function on each component. While the primary purpose is to do serialization, it could be used to do other reflection-y things, like build a UI widget for arbitrary structures. To really support full reflection though serde would have to be modified to support in-place modification. It wouldn&#x27;t trivial, but it&#x27;s certainly not impossible.",1435971549

IOW, defer is a superset of RAII.<p>In all other cases (which is almost all usages), it is semantically equivalent to RAII, so the language doesn&#x27;t force any runtime overhead. The only difference is that the compiler is less mature than an average C++ compiler, but this is an implementation problem, not a design problem.<p>RAII has no overhead because it is a pattern designed within the context of a zero-overhead language. defer allows you to implement a superset of cases that RAII handles, including those with runtime overhead.",1435971373

9828681,comment,9827051,9828348,0,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> Raise your hand if you plan to stop using ncurses because of how opposed to how &quot;harmful&quot; goto statements are.<p>What if I just avoid contributing to the ncurses codebase?  I&#x27;ve used plenty of useful tools with absolutely horrific codebases that I&#x27;d never want to touch in a million years.  Not sure if ncurses is one of them.<p>The whole &quot;it gets used, ergo it must be a good idea&quot; argument doesn&#x27;t hold much traction with me - even if I think using it when in C, to enforce single exit style, to work around the lack of RAII constructs, goto is the lesser evil.<p>I started with GOTO in BASIC.  I used it a lot.  It structured my initial reasoning about control flow.  Despite this, in the past few years, I&#x27;ve used a naked goto maybe once or twice, and in all cases later rewrote it without the goto, which in my opinion increased it&#x27;s readability.  (I generally always have the option of C++ over C, and choose it, rendering single exit style &#x27;useless&#x27;.)<p>> Oh, here&#x27;s tmux, if you&#x27;re interested (one of the most beautifully written C programs): <a href=""https://github.com/tmux/tmux/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=goto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tmux/tmux/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=goto</a><p>Most of those are single exit style gotos.  Those that aren&#x27;t, do cause some concern, despite being &quot;one of the most beautifully written C programs&quot;, even to their original author from the looks of it:<p><pre><code>  if (errno == ENOMEM)
    goto retry; /* possible infinite loop? */
</code></pre>
For what it&#x27;s worth, it seems unlikely to be an infinite loop, short of encountering a bug in sysctl, or another process/thread constantly adding data.  I had to google the header path to find an appropriate manpage (i.e. not _sysctl, not sysctl the program) to figure this out...<p>I&#x27;ve encountered worse edge cases before, however, and I&#x27;d really prefer my programs crash properly, instead of hanging when they do.<p>> State machines, for example, can make good use of gotos.<p>The performance complaints about an additional branch misprediction when using the &quot;for(;;) switch(...)&quot; style without gotos, is one of the few arguments that moves me, if only slightly.  That seems like a case your standard optimizing compiler really should be able to handle, however.  I&#x27;ll assume they don&#x27;t, as I&#x27;m too lazy to test if this is merely hearsay...<p>That said, I&#x27;ll even use &quot;goto case&quot; in C# on occasion where I&#x27;d use case fallthrough in C++, if I&#x27;m feeling particularly lazy and don&#x27;t want to turn things into proper method calls  that can simply call each other just yet.  I <i>usually</i> clean it up before I start to confuse myself.<p>It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d miss if it were gone, however.  It&#x27;s something I use only rarely, and only as a crutch to stave off cleanup.  Not exactly a ringing endorsement.<p>EDIT: Code formatting, proper insertion of subject...",1435971155

I too am sometimes swallowed in the euphoria of what we have created and what we will create, the possibilities open to us, and those others just around the corner.<p>And I mean it when I say I don&#x27;t mean to be a spoil-sport, but as you say yourself, it&#x27;s not all good.More specifically, the good and the bad are not evenly distributed. Where the economy gives with one hand it takes with the other. When a labour saving technology is introduced to reduce prices, and increase ease of access, to the consumer, somebody becomes unemployed, or is forced into situation of job insecurity.<p>Without confronting hard questions about the distribution of value generated by new technologies this tech-euphoria is a purely self indulgent act. In an age where some of us have access to every book ever written on our phone, people lack access to a decent education. While some of us can order a &#x27;lyft&#x27; in minutes to get to work, others struggle to pay the bus fare for the 2 hour commute for their minimum wage job. While airbnb allows some of us to travel the world meeting interesting people with more ease than ever before, thousands are homeless on the streets of San Francisco. While some order home cooked meals to their door, others starve.<p>I say this not to attack the euphoria. We ARE living in the future. We ARE creating the future. But the future, as the past, is composed of great contradictions. The euphoria we feel for that which is possible must confront a great anger at the grim reality of increasing inequality.<p>That we have the technology required for the whole human race to live in health, dignity, and security is nothing new. Since the end of the 19th century people have been celebrating the human races&#x27; liberation from toil, and its access to the fruits of our collective labour. (My personal favourite example is Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;conquest of bread&quot;, <a href=""http://libcom.org/library/the-conquest-of-bread-peter-kropotkin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libcom.org/library/the-conquest-of-bread-peter-kropot...</a>, published in 1906) The question which hangs is still that of distribution. How do we evenly distribute both the labour required and the spoils of that labour such that nobody goes without?<p>Whenever we think &quot;damn, I got it so good&quot;, we should also be thinking &quot;why do some still have it so bad?&quot;, or &quot;how can society be organised in such a way that we can all benefit from this?&quot;<p>Without this critical response to the great technological developments of our age we run the risk of losing our selves in a &quot;filter-bubble&quot; of those who share our privilege, and with that loose sight of the full potential of the technologies we use and create.",1435970321

With a 10% reserve requirement, a single $100 deposit at one bank becomes $1,000 of credit in the entire banking system.<p>However, the point that I am trying to make is that you cannot do that with bitcoin because you cannot lend out BTC that you do not have.  If you start out with 100 BTC, you can never increase that amount by any kind of fractional reserve lending - there will only ever be 100 BTC.<p>The idea of &quot;BTC credit&quot; expressed as actual BTC makes no sense -- 1 BTC is 1 BTC it is the thing that is used for trade.  If you want to create a new kind of currency that is backed by bitcoin and start a bank that uses that currency for fractional lending, then there is nothing to stop you, but you would have to operate in something other than actual BTC for credit - using actual BTC for that just won&#x27;t work, as you&#x27;ll quickly run out of any BTC that you had after only a few transactions/loans.",1435970152

It makes me sad, that these days, there is simply no time for justice. There are so many complex scandals the average citizen cannot understand coming up after each other, by the time a scandal is investigated it is not interesting any more. So the public has largely just given up caring. There is some outrage but overall the sentiment seems to be: &quot;Well, that&#x27;s what politicians do.&quot;<p>Merkel hired those genius consultants, who taught her how to act, dress and hold her hands so that she is immune to public outcry. We know she is brilliant but she comes across as being just as stupid as we are but totally upright. She would never enrich herself or get caught being openly corrupt. She is just to boring for that, which is exactly what the German people want their leader to be. Every other politician would have lost his job so many times by now, but that woman can get away with everything. She is made out of teflon, these scandals just bounce of of her. And it is not, that we do not notices this: She famously destroyed all her political enemies a few years ago - after all the number two is 72 years old now. It makes me sad, that it works nevertheless.<p>The biggest political scandal in recent years was the fall of president Wulff [0]. There have been minor but simple accusations that the public could understand and was outrageous about. No complex monetary system, no difficult cold-war conflict, no highly technical espionage stuff. He was corrupt, but on a scale that the average person is corrupt. Take a small present here and there, take photos with people you should not take photos with. You cannot get away with something simple like that, especially when you handle the crisis badly.<p>The logical conclusion is, that we get borderline psychopaths and/or actors as politicians, who manage to build up an image of total boringness. They cannot be educated in any field, because their field actually is managing their own image. It makes me sad, that you are more likely to stay in office when you seem boring and stupid instead of intelligent and innovative. We ended up with a Kafkaesque bureaucratic system where everybody just maintains the status quo and tries to separate him- or herself as much from actual politics as possible. This of course leaves the actual decisionmaking to institutions like the intelligence agencies or big corporations and is how we end up with stuff like this.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causa_Wulff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causa_Wulff</a>",1435968580

It does not exist. `Animal::talk` is purely shorthand for `<_ as Animal>::talk`, meaning that it is a specific type’s implementation of the `talk` method. In the case of `Animal::talk(dog)` where `dog` is of type `&Dog`, the `_` can be inferred to be `Dog`, and so `Animal::talk(dog)` is equivalent to `Dog::talk(dog)` and `<Dog as Animal>::talk(dog)`.<p>The default implementation, if overridden, does not exist for the given type.",1435968241

Modern, fully-supported html5 and javascript means I can build cross-platform webapps that do really interesting stuff on desktops and mobile devices. Since I&#x27;m part of a team of two developing most of the application framework, I&#x27;m really not interested in building native apps for iOS and Android to go along with the desktop app- my time would be much better spent making sure the web app works well on all mobile platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve already run into this- I have to either polyfill or avoid using modern javascript APIs (localStorage, web workers) because there&#x27;s absolutely no iOS option. The nature of my vertical market is such that I <i>could</i> get away with asking my users to run chrome or ff if one works better than the other, but I&#x27;m basically stuck with iOS / safari as the lowest common denominator, and have no real options to improve, other than just pulling support for iOS entirely (something I&#x27;m seriously considering).",1435968203

9828554,comment,9825021,9827795,0,0,adrianmacneil,,,"> Banks are legally allowed to issue credit up to a specified multiple of their reserves, so, extending your analogy above, imagine an additional eight people behind you requesting to overdraft their account by $100. As a result of your $100 deposit, the bank is now legally authorized to approve each of those requests for a total of $900 in credit that was created out of nowhere.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly how fractional reserve banking works. Banks can lend out a multiple of the reserves they hold, but they can&#x27;t lend out more than their total cash on hand. If $100 was all our hypothetical bank contained, then it could only lend out $90 of it, not $900.<p>The exact same thing could be done with Bitcoin. If you put it in a bank, they could lend this out to another party (and use future deposits to pay you back if you tried to withdraw your BTC).",1435968017

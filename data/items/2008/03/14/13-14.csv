Instead of pumping money into playing catch-up with Google, they should supporting start-up enterprises that are innovating beyond Google.

136746,comment,136381,136392,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Nah, the price of stale ideas and rehashes is very low.  When there's a new big idea and big success, it is very highly valued (look at Blogger, del.icio.us, etc when they were released and bought vs now).  The point of a startup is to validate an idea in the market.  A validated idea is worth <i>MUCH</i> more than an unvalidated one, but when you copy a validated idea, you're also competing against the people that validated it, which brings a whole new set of problems.",1205500422

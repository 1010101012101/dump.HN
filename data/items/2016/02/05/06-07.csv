What used to seem good enough now seems to have obvious flaws, even if it the same as it was before. Lack of control is an example: beginners often don&#x27;t notice or care much, especially if it feels simpler, but as your needs deepen it becomes more important.

11040000,comment,11039240,11039629,0,0,gnarbarian,,,"Funny you should say that. I agree with some aspects of your complaint. But I place the blame on trendy tech companies and wonder why we don&#x27;t see more investment/activity from tech firms here. Oil has been what makes money in AK for the last 35 years, We&#x27;re not going to change overnight. There are attractive things for tech startups here. In Anchorage I have a gigabit home internet connection.  I&#x27;m Sr. Programmer, I&#x27;ve been in the industry for 10 years, have a CS degree and I only make $70k per year. In other words we have a supply glut for programmers in Anchorage.  I could make more in Cali, I&#x27;d have to leave my california illegal guns with my family first.   I could also forget about hunting and fishing with my dad every weekend. I bet the the best backcountry snowboarding in california is a far cry from what I have an hour from my house. The real issue is I derive value from what I can do in my time off here that I can&#x27;t do anywhere else in the world.  There is talent up here that can be tapped for pennies on the dollar when compared to NY or SF. I&#x27;m sure there is even more talent who would like to move here because it&#x27;s friggen awesome[1].<p>I wonder why we don&#x27;t see more startup activity here, where you can actually operate a business and hire good people for less than six figures. Meanwhile the employees can rent apartments or even buy houses and have a mortgate with a 10 min bike commute to the office for around 1k per month.<p>Sure seems silly seeing all those people pay out the ass for an apartment to commute two hours to an office the startup can barely afford with no parking.  You would think a bunch of software engineers would be able to solve a simple network optimization problem by pushing resources to the edge of the graph but it seems like an office in a trendy location and insane taxes and rent is more important than a sustainable operating budget with work life balance.  But of course us Alaskan&#x27;s are the dumb ones.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/llGid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/llGid</a>",1454655126

Or figuring out which geographical regions some company was doing a project in if I was interested in learning more... people usually like talking about their interests after all.<p>Also good for finding well respected people in my field, figuring out from that which companies are doing good work there, and keeping tabs on the companies so that I have a clue what the more global picture is outside of my immediate circles.<p>I do not work in programming though.",1454655113
11039996,comment,11036789,11039962,0,0,gavanwoolery,,,"It totally depends on the scope of your project, IMO.  If you are a one man team making a small indie game, then it probably makes the most sense just to use a simple file system with the naming convention you suggest.  The reason I would avoid such a thing in a bigger project is that inevitably such a system will break or become complex if it is not managed by a machine (even I, as a one man team, have hit this problem and I had to go in and rename hundreds of files for a simple change).  A simple analogy is an SQL database - you could depend on naming stuff precisely by certain key values to make sense of it, but it becomes more powerful if you provide it with some simple data for each entry and let the computer make sense of it (select all objects with tag &quot;static&quot; and &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;desert&quot; for example).  A given convention will force organization inherently. Every time you need to update an object you simply look it up in the editor/engine and reload it from a file you select.",1454655098

They are implemented as transient units when you use --exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=systemd (in your daemon&#x27;s cmdline). I&#x27;ve been working on getting this support much better (in runC and therefore in Docker), however systemd just has bad support for many of the new cgroups when creating transient units.<p>So really, Docker has systemd support. Systemd doesn&#x27;t have decent support for all of the cgroup knobs that libcontainer needs (not to mention that systemd has <i>no</i> support for namespaces). I&#x27;d recommend pushing systemd to improve their transient unit knobs.<p>But I&#x27;d rather like to know why the standard cgroupfs driver doesn&#x27;t fulfil your needs?

11039979,comment,11038281,11038281,0,0,inaudible,,,"GitHub got off the ground on-selling an emerging open-source product as a service with some innovations around data visualizations / analytics and community structure, customized for the web. Their growth really comes down to the right set of features at the right time, a low friction setup, good price point and good flow of communication with their user base.<p>The perceived stagnation is likely a side-effect of scaling the operation to fit with increased demand and the growth and expectations of their private & enterprise (paying) customers, who have become notably more high profile as the years roll on. With it comes the difficulty and expense of providing a dependent, secure infrastructure and a more refined and audited code base to fit the needs.<p>It&#x27;s a diverse community here and while some groups consistently demand feature freeze (hating on &#x27;bloat&#x27;, &#x27;features coming from marketing&#x27;, focus on &#x27;core product&#x27;), others are only convinced that a products relevancy is  based only on cutting edge features (&#x27;we need feature a, because b&#x27;, &#x27;product c is irrelevant because product d offers a&#x27;). To offer refinement that appeals to both camps is a delicate tightrope.<p>Meanwhile you have market speculation that would use in part a forum like this as a sounding board for some kind of consumer sentiment index.<p>The complaints with GitHub seem fairly incidental, people airing their grievances on the incumbent because the cost of moving is considered either a hassle or a big-deal. But moving is an option, and the perceived stagnation is building a better competition (that they fulfill the promise without other expenses is always the gamble). GitHub isn&#x27;t without problems, and it does seem like some obvious community complaints that have stagnated, but once released it&#x27;ll probably just be a case of &#x27;finally, thanks, no love lost&#x27;.<p>In the end, Git by nature is decentralized, easily self hosted, and both GitLab and Phabricator provide  interesting open-source environments. It&#x27;s not exactly a one way street.<p>But maybe it was always going to be a tough market to corner?

They also all have much higher population densities where public transit makes sense and most people can&#x27;t even afford to buy a car. That is not analogous to the situation here. There isn&#x27;t a single European country with a population density so low it is close to Alaska [1].  Even Norway who is most similar to AK and is an oil producer has much smaller towns that individually are less spread out and are more easily served by public transit as a whole, norway has 30x the population density of AK[1]. In these civilized utopias most people can&#x27;t even consider buying a car there due to artificially inflated costs from over regulation and taxes. I like a 4x4 truck that can get me to work in shitty weather. I like being able to afford to drive a boat around the ocean on the weekends and catch halibut. None of this pertains to my argument though and only serves to offer a bit of perspective.<p>Regardless of consumer costs ($10 more is still a far cry from $110) What really matters here is the supply glut which causes a shortage of demand per unit of oil. This kills margins and rules out any new investment and developments in Alaska. These are the things that drive jobs. High margins fund the state government and new development. Low prices mean layoffs across the board before we even think about a huge tax stabbing into demand.  In other words, that tax will retard oil&#x27;s recovery by artificially suppressing national demand for oil. US consumers can withstand it no problem. But at the moment that tax is equivalent to kicking Alaska&#x27;s economy in the gut when we&#x27;re already on the ground trying to tap out.<p>I love Alaska and I don&#x27;t want to have to move. If you can&#x27;t empathize with that I understand. Who cares about 700,000 rednecks and eskimos up north who like to fish and hunt. They&#x27;re probably all like sarah palin anyway haha. (she screwed our oil industry with crazy taxes and pretty much single handedly ensured AK industry didn&#x27;t take part in or benefit from the US oil boom and is not a popular person around here)<p>Like it or not. The US is a major oil producer now thanks to shale oil and technological improvements. High oil prices enabled us to go for harder to reach fields and the low price eliminates their feasibility.  Like I said before, We produce as much oil as saudi arabia. Low prices will have a dramatic negative effect in many localized places like alaska.  I understand if you don&#x27;t empathize with us or care what happens to our economy but this kind of tax is not going to do alaska texas oklahoma idaho or north dakota any favors.<p>[1] norway has 14 people per sq/km versus 0.46 people per sq/km in alaska.

I spend a lot of time on the computer so I like a lot of things apple does, mostly the interface and the UI. To clarify what UI means to me, it is how simple and intuitive it is to use the device, and give it the instructions to do what I want. I am willing to forgive a lot because this is good.<p>Apple has always been a fairly closed system and it didn&#x27;t bother me <i>more</i> than not having the features I wanted. In El Capitan, it was different. Things didn&#x27;t work well and Apple took over my whole system. With SIP(system integrity protection) I had no control. It would seem to turn protection back on after being disabled, and it takes a nontrivial amount of time to turn it off because you have to  reboot the entire system into recovery mode, wait for it to connect to the internet and download a bunch of apple shit, and then select a language preference and then type a command into bash and reboot.<p>Deleting apps is difficult, changing settings is difficult, having siri take up 10% of my iphone is annoying, removing apps destabalize the system, installing my system from time machine reinstalls their system and settings and overrides mine.<p>I disabled most of apples applications and processes, the system in fairly stable, although I think I went to far with disabling notification center, but your point is correct.<p>tl;dr users are willing to accept a lot for revolutionary changes.

My take on this is that Apple has actually <i>improved</i> at their traditional weakness of cloud services to the point where now people <i>use it</i> enough to complain.<p>Cloud services is the one area where newer companies like Google and Facebook have a distinct advantage over Apple and is really the only threat (Android can never be as stable as iOS because of the vertical integration).  Cloud services are amazing because they add so much value in the mobile era where you can easily operate from multiple devices without syncing nightmares. Google&#x27;s cloud services are the thing which makes Android better than iOS in the areas its superior.<p>Up until now Apple&#x27;s offerings were so ridiculously terrible than no one even used them, whether it was iDisk or MobileMe or whatever other branded services they churned through—they were utterly unusable.  In the iCloud era it&#x27;s actually become usable which exposes all the warts in new features which would have been hitherto impossible, whether it&#x27;s iCloud app developer woes, message syncing issues, or Photos complaints, these things have all become usable now and at least arguably competitive with Google&#x27;s offerings in the same spaces.<p>Sure there are warts, and sure it&#x27;s annoying OS X doesn&#x27;t get the love it deserves as iOS drives the company, and sure they&#x27;re struggling with the scope of maintenance they&#x27;re now saddled with, but that&#x27;s not really the sky-is-falling narrative that tech bloggers have been pining to snap onto the Tim Cook era.",1454653108

They loved to sing songs and share things at one time, too.<p>Their only fault is that they were perhaps more efficient or &quot;luckier&quot; than the rest of us in acquiring their wealth. Which in turn forced the rich person persona onto them. It&#x27;s pretty much downhill from there on out. Save for a few astonishing outliers like Bill Gates, thankfully.<p>Money is the new God.<p>It cures our blind and heals our lepers. It puts food on our tables for which we give thanks. If even withers our fig trees.<p>It performs real miracles every day in a way that a book never could.<p>In short, I&#x27;m not surprised that those who have acquired massive amounts of money are now suffering from delusions of grandeur.<p>Is it possible to restrict the power that money has while still retaining most of it&#x27;s core values? I don&#x27;t know... But I&#x27;d bet money on it that we&#x27;re going to find out pretty soon.",1454652437

The few technical details they mention seem to indicate that it&#x27;s some kind of VM running on your phone.  This brings a bunch of limitations with it; I use my desktop not only for the nice screen, but also the i7 processor, 1TB+ SSD, ridiculous amounts of RAM and gigabit network card.  So assuming the VM guess is correct, you&#x27;re getting a 5+ year old PC in your pocket.<p>I suspect there are some people who could make great use of something like this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me.

So basically, this is for companies that sell point of sale systems?<p>I am aware that credit card processing is quite poorly implemented, so it seems like they are:<p>* making it less bad<p>* further exercising their monopoly<p>* adding more security at the transmission level<p>so, like who would use this? Basically this is for something like square where you would actual take physical cards and process them? It seems like if a user has a debit card you can process a fee for like 5 basis points. So, Visa is offering a way for merchants and payment processors to improve the security of their (credit card companies) own product so feasibly, they could lower their fees in the future, because they wouldn&#x27;t have to pass along the massive amount of costs fraud creates due to the systems insecurity.<p>So, like, who uses this? Just payment processors and companies big enough to have their own point of sale? It seems like a big bet to expend engineering resources on.<p>What is the upside? Security is priced in to the processing fee, right? So, basically there is no gain for someone who already has a working gateway unless they force them to use this. If you do that engineering spend and get it to work, it is a big bet that users will continue to use a fairly unsecured payment method and carry it around with them, and that mobile payments won&#x27;t become normalized in the next few years.",1454652105

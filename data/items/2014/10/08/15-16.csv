They would much rather spend $6 billion and earn 10%, instead of spending $5 billion and earning 10%.<p>That&#x27;s what happens when the rate of return is fixed.  The more they spend, the more they earn.  Consumer groups routinely show up at regulatory commissions and complain that the electric utility is spending too much on upgrading the grid.<p>> <i>Comcast behaves in a similar manner.</i><p>Comcast is a minimally-regulated monopoly that is <i>not</i> earning a fixed rate of return.  The less they spend, the more they earn.",1412783967

With late binding it reads it&#x27;s state twice, once for page construction and again to construct the next page.<p>With early binding, only the name of the function has to be passed back immediately, construction of the function itself can be queued depending on server load (e.g. the function can be built 100ms later) and the user is likely unaffected. With late binding a 100ms delay in page building due to server load happens while the user is waiting.<p>The cost of the continuation approach is that a lot of continuations may be constructed that never get run.

One doesn&#x27;t have some of the stuff I want but the others do. This is pretty common, I know if I want a particular product I have to go to a particular store to get it. I go grocery shopping probably 3-4 times a week because I only buy enough stuff for 1-3 meals. This is to reduce waste. Less often shopping leads to food waste for me.<p>Sure they can look me up, and I used to not carry the grocery store cards, but I find flashing the card about 1000 times more convenient.<p>We are up to 12 cards.<p>I have to carry two IDs, driver&#x27;s license and US GOVT ID.

If I were seriously hard up and didn&#x27;t see any good prospects for finding employment in the future, I could move to Oklahoma or Nebraska or somewhere super cheap and find a place for less than $600 a month, which would extend my savings at least another 6 months (depending on when I decided to make the move).<p>I&#x27;m also 20 years younger than you and have only recently started investing (in the last 5 years).<p>Looking at my own retirement plans, it&#x27;s estimated that I&#x27;ll need about $1.8 million in savings to retire the way I want.

Well, after a while, it became one of the largest dynamic DNS providers in the world, and router manufacturers around the world started supporting it in the UI. Dyndns used to provide an address (an olden-days plaintext web API of sorts) to check the external IP of a router. Eventually, manufacturers realized that even if they didn&#x27;t have a deal with dyndns or even formally support them, they can use their IP address to check the router WAN IP. Major manufacturers like linksys and d-link (I think, don&#x27;t take my word for it) jumped on the bandwagon and everyone started pinging the crap out of that page and if they took it down, these routers would break in interesting ways. So they built it up and kept it running.<p>That API runs to this day, at checkip.dyndns.org.<p>edit: Today that company is dyn.com, bootstrapped pretty much all the way, and provides DNS to twitter, etsy, fastly, the guardian etc.",1412782012

If the eInk screen uses the card plastic in place of the glass which usually backs such a screen, it can easily be thin enough for a credit card form factor.<p>Touch screen digitizing can be done resistively with overlaid wires over the screen.  Their touch interface doesn&#x27;t have to be super accurate, you only seem to touch in a few distinct locations.<p>A microcontroller is already inside every chip and pin card on the planet.  They usually run Java.  Yes, Java :)<p>Bluetooth is just more silicon to do the radio, not hard to stick it on the side of the microcontroller silicon or even have a two-die configuration with wire bonding between the dies.  Go look at TI or Freescale 2.4 GHz radio+micro parts, same thing just there it&#x27;s in a QFN or other solder-down package, but the dies themselves are quite small.  A 2.4 GHz antenna is easy to fab out of printed silver or other printable conductive material onto plastic.<p>NFC is already in many credit cards for the whole &quot;tap to pay&quot; thing.  It&#x27;s just some extra silicon on the side of the microcontroller in existing solutions.  Harvesting power from NFC is just some diodes and a resonant circuit along with loop antenna.<p>Realistically, such a piece of silicon plus the antennas plus the plastic card should only cost you single digit dollars in volume to manufacture.  Adding an eInk screen like that is another couple bucks, at most.  The $155 price point is probably so they can make back their up-front costs as getting customized silicon isn&#x27;t cheap, nor is some of the development work they did to get all the features integrated.<p>If this concept takes off, I&#x27;d expect in 2-3 years that cards like this are issued by banks for free to customers.  The cost of manufacturing really isn&#x27;t that high.<p>EDIT: But getting enough battery packed in to avoid charging every day or two, that&#x27;s really the novel part if they have real bluetooth operation.",1412781427

The problem is when the law says the government <i>can&#x27;t</i> do it, but they do it anyway. That&#x27;s when the government <i>is</i> breaking the law, and there&#x27;s nothing right or good about it. They should be held accountable for such illegal acts.",1412781408

If a government agency has the ability to perform an action that is otherwise illegal for a person who is not a member of said agency it is outlined in the law. If it is not outlined in the law then they are in fact committing a crime and may be criminally liable for it.<p>That is why whenever there is a police-involved shooting there is supposed to be a review of the incident to see if the officer in question followed the guidelines as outlined in the law. If it is determined that the officer did not follow policy then he can be subject to criminal prosecution.<p>I&#x27;m not making this up, it happened recently. In South Carolina a state trooper shoots an unarmed man for reaching into his vehicle after being asked to show ID. The dashcam clearly shows the shooting was entirely unjustified. That trooper was fired and charged with assault and battery, facing a potential 20 years in prison. That is what should happen when a government agent breaks the law.<p>So, unless the agent from the original article had permission under the law to falsely pose as a real person without that person&#x27;s permission then they likely broke the law and may face criminal and/or civil action.",1412781402

Is my summary correct?<p>This optimization does not apply to Postgres in general, but only to citrus_fdw and other column-store foreign data wrappers.<p>The Postgres execution engine was designed to operate on a row-store.  Even so, it can operate on a column-store via a foreign data wrapper like citrus_fdw.  However, to do so it must currently reconstruct rows-at-a-time to fit its row-oriented nature.  As a result, it cannot currently realize the potential performance benefits of using a column-store for certain queries.<p>This article is about an extension that adds some new column-at-a-time aggregate functions, then hooks into the Postgres executor to modify eligible query plans to use them.  It thus enables Postgres to take advantage of the column-oriented nature of the citrus_fdw.<p>Is that an accurate way to look at it?",1412780993

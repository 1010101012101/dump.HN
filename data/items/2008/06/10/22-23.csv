214388,comment,213737,213943,0,0,walterk,,,"I'd suggest requiring everyone who submits a story to justify its relevance via the text box, ignoring all story submissions that <i>don't</i> have accompanying text (the exact opposite of how it currently works).  That should deter a lot of impulse submissions, requiring users to think about why a story is worth posting here.  And it should cultivate voting practices that maintain a stronger eye towards community relevance, as opposed to general interest.  I.e., don't upvote unless the submitter successfully argues their case.<p>Restricting upvoting controls to a story's dedicated comments page would also deter impulse upvoting and force users to check out the justification.",1213138701

Time Warner does not say they're going to block access to usenet, but only that they plan to stop offering it as a part of their service; this is not the same thing, as you could presumably still use a third-party usenet provider, such as Giganews.<p>""We're going to stop offering our subscribers newsgroups,"" said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable.

214386,comment,214359,214359,0,0,wmf,,,"Usenet has been in decline for years; I've heard that only  1% or less of Internet users access Usenet these days, and most of them are probably the ""bandwidth hogs"" that ISPs hate anyway. Time Warner used to have news server farms in each city then they outsourced their Usenet to one of the big providers. This just gives ISPs an excuse to stop wasting money on Usenet altogether.",1213138654

If people can't use upvotes reasonably, what makes you think they will use downvotes reasonably?<p>I think this story rose to the top because it's aligned with the eigenvector of TC-related talk at HN. Hive mind has awakened and achieved a stable thread of thought. Over time we will see more of those stable waves forming.

Sure: anything that, in the database world, would require transactions.<p>Think of the classic double-entry accounting transaction: you have two accounts, and need to atomically subtract an amount from one and add it to the other.  Clearly the accounts are two (or more) REST URIs.  But the operation needs to be atomic on both; it's not enough just to do two PUT/POST operations.  You <i>can</i> do it with REST, but it requires some fancy footwork with extra objects for ""locks"" or whatnot.  It's just a mess.<p>With a protocol that exposes behavior instead of state?  It's just a ""DEBIT"" command that takes two accounts and an amount and returns success or failure.<p>Basically: pick the tool for the job.

10323165,comment,10322929,10322929,0,0,Animats,,,"PARC was in the glory days of corporate research labs. PARC, Bell Labs, IBM Almaden, Sarnoff Labs, HP Labs, etc.  Research labs that were part of big companies.  I was lucky enough to visit many of those in their prime.<p>I got to tour PARC in 1975, years before Steve Jobs did, when I took a summer course in computer architecture taught by William McKeeman. He was the architect of a generation of Burroughs CPUs, and knew everybody in CPU design.  So I met Alan Kay before anybody had heard of him. He had a vision, but it wasn&#x27;t quite what most people think it was.  He said the big advantage they had was that they were funded heavily enough to build the single-user computers of the future now.  The Alto was over $20K (some said $50K) per unit, which was insanely expensive for a single user computer.  It took another decade to get the cost down.  Kay&#x27;s group saw as their job to get the software ready for when the hardware came down in price.<p>Kay was thinking that the killer app for personal computers was going to be simulations.  He later had a demo graphical hospital simulation, which was a discrite-event simulator where patients came in with a complaint (&quot;I am a victim of Bowlerthumb&quot;), and went through Admitting, Examination, Surgery, etc. out to Discharge.  Smalltalk is based on Simula, an Algol-derived simulation language, and was originally intended for discrite-event simulation.  Document preparation and mail were a sideline.[1]<p>Kay was operating in an empty world. Almost nobody else was throwing money at what software should look like a decade or two hence, for a class of machines that didn&#x27;t exist yet. That was a huge advantage.  Anything good that was done there advanced the state of the art.<p>Kay&#x27;s group was only a small part of PARC.  There were other people in the large building working on copier technology and the physics behind xerography. (Unfortunately for Xerox, they didn&#x27;t invent organic photoconductors, which made xerography machines much smaller and cheaper.  IBM did.)  Kay&#x27;s group had considerable engineering resources to draw upon, machine shops and electronics shops and chemistry labs that could make things. They were able to have their own CRT tubes made for the Alto.   It&#x27;s a lot easier to invent when you have that kind of substantial engineering backup.  That&#x27;s why they were able to build a laser printer - they were in an engineering facility that could build both a CRT and a copier.  Kay&#x27;s group just did the software and some of the electronics.<p>That&#x27;s hard to reproduce - all that engineering backup.  It&#x27;s only available within a big business that makes real stuff.  Today, Samsung and Fujitsu have labs like that, but few US companies, at least in the electronics/computer sector, do.  There are a few military operations with such capabilities - China Lake Naval Weapons Center is one; they can design, build, and flight-test something in-house.<p>So that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s hard to reproduce PARC - you need an empty field of research, and heavy engineering backup.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/1977/03/01646405.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/1977/03/01646405.pdf</a>",1443862463

Let me explain...<p>Imagine you were developing a car. As part of the project you would need to test, test, test and test the drivetrain and the engine. For your test data to be relevant you would want a controlled environment, e.g. car on perfectly flat road with no pot holes, turns or aerodynamic consideration. You could then adjust the variables and check the results - power, torque, emissions, noise level, oil use, fuel use, temperatures and so on.<p>In this development mode the test rig works pretty good. Figures can be produced that are important for the engine/drivetrain development. Variables can be changed and results measured. The figures - defeat device aside - are actually true with the normal margins for statistical measurement (not every engine will be 100% exactly the same even if it came off the same production batch).<p>The problem - defeat device aside - is when regulatory bodies use this data for what they need to know, i.e. real world performance. They accept data that they know is not real world and accept it as &#x27;fact&#x27;.<p>If we look at our own testing for building apps, websites and such like we take a modular approach, testing our dev boxes with some type of &#x27;seige&#x27; that does not factor in real world internet connectivity and bandwidth, not to mention how customers might use our products in the wild. We can even prove to our clients that their site isn&#x27;t slow, sharing our metrics with them. Yet, in the real world things don&#x27;t quite attain those metrics. Luckily nobody gets harmed if our &#x27;squirrel picture app for cats&#x27; app falls short.<p>So, it is the procedures that are wrong and our standards bodies that are doing it wrong (by blindly accepting manufacturers&#x27; test data). We are lucky that VW have been cheating as we now are having the conversation about the testing methodology.",1443860620

Which to me as a reader shows that he empathises with the people he bombed. It&#x27;s not an eternal truth about man killing man happening but it&#x27;s something he did to another human being.
When he meets the girl in the rain he&#x27;s in another context in another moment between people. And he feels worthwhile for a moment again. She leaves him in the story so the fucking end goal is taken of the table. It was just an isolated moment that&#x27;s meaningful in itself. And he feels differently. If we want to give the transition of feeling a name we might say he feels redeemed.
Just like the meeting in the rain was isolated and without end result similarly the posting on craigslist is without end result and follow up but it&#x27;s still meaningful after 40+ yrs. Which goes to underscore that our emotions in life are often without end result and followed by totally different emotions and attendant value systems. But we have to experience them as meaningful anyway. 
Because the alternative is nihilism and depression.<p>Just an impression of what goes through me at this point in my life when I read that story. I recognise your take on it as well.

Credit scores look at your &#x27;oldest tradeline&#x27; and maintaining good credit over many years is viewed favorably. Their scores will not be as high as someone who had recent credit transaction and managing it well (all else being equal), however, it will still be very good.

And, as the article says, it&#x27;s the norm in Japan too.<p>Actually, the headline should read &quot;why are USA little kids the only ones so dependent?&quot;<p>I could go ahead and be a demagogue and say it&#x27;s because all the helicopter parenting and the fear mass media... but I think it has more to do with the fact that we can go walking anywhere.<p>Europeans in general, and Spaniards in particular, live on the streets. We hardly use cars: most things are at walking distance, and public transportation is fine. Real crime, like abductions and violence, is very rare, and people help each other.<p>Local policemen (non-militarized) are everywhere and they help any lost kids. I have been lost maybe a couple times, in a supermarket and in a foreign city and, while I lament the stress that caused on my parents, they knew that I would turn up at some point. And I did. I was a little kid and I was just... lost. That happens and it&#x27;s not a huge deal.<p>I&#x27;ll turn the argument 180 degrees: the USA is a very, very young country. You know what they say, in Europe, 1000 km is a long distance, and in the US, 1000 years is a long time. We&#x27;ve been living in small cities literally since the dawn of time. We&#x27;ve walked. Many cities have streets where cars don&#x27;t even fit.<p>It is mainly a car and culture problem.

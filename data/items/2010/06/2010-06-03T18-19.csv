I don't know whether or not I will be wealthy some day.  I haven't even decided if the attempt is how I want to spend my life.  While a freer market would make it easier if I did try, that is not why I favor it.  I favor it because it would make such an attempt easier for <i>anyone</i> who wanted to try.  Because I believe it fundamentally just for individuals to own what they create, to profit from their labors however they can, to be able to spend their money freely on anything anyone else is willing to provide at whatever price they find mutually agreeable.<p>I think it is the fairest way to distribute wealth--those who create it keep whatever they make--and the surest road to prosperity.<p>Now, you can disagree with me about that opinion.  I could well be wrong about whether markets work, or whether they're fair, or whether they make everybody prosperous.  Hackers are famously conoisseurs of ideas, and I am no exception.  I like new ones.<p>What I resent is false analysis of my motivations, the prediction that I'll change my opinion if I cannot realize selfish, unlikely dreams.

1402114,comment,1400986,1402035,0,0,scott_s,,,"It's not the time spent that matters, it's the quality of the time spent. Intensity matters. A 30 minute intense workout is better than a leisurely 2 hour workout.<p>There's no real formula. When I started strength training, I knew nothing. I was lean and weighed about 155 pounds. That was about 9 years ago. In about two years I put on 20 pounds so that I was about 175. Over the course of two or so years, I put on about another 10 pounds so that I was usually around 185. Around then I switched my focus to compound lifts like deadlifts and clean & press. I shot up to 195 pounds. Last summer I lifted four days a week and shot up to 205 pounds. Now I walk around closer to 200 because I don't do much strength training. It's mostly grappling and conditioning - things that keep me in shape but they don't add any muscle mass.<p>A good goal when you start is to do strength training three days a week. That's enough to make progress, but you won't feel like you're always doing it.<p>I agree completely with the author of this article: focus on compound lifts like squat, deadlift, cleans, overhead press, clean and press. You'll need to invest time to <i>learn</i> how to do these lifts. Doing them properly (that is, in such a way that avoids injury and allows you to add weight) is a skill, and like any skill, you need practice to get good at it.<p>Also keep in mind that getting stronger and adding muscle mass is an <i>adaptation</i>. You're putting your body under some stress, and your body adapts to the stress by getting stronger. If you keep using the same stress, your body doesn't need to adapt anymore. You need to continually change what you do (more weight, or more reps, different exercises, less rest, etc.) to continue to see improvements.",1275590873

Today's authorities wrap themselves in ""anti-authoritarianism"", constantly demanding that we express ourselves creativity, think for ourselves and be unique. Far from being subversive, this reflexive self-fashioning and self-expression is harnessed to create profit for the powerful, from the simplest blog post generating page views and advertising dollars, to the creation of new tech start-ups innovating new products to periodically revitalize the aging bureaucratic global corporate status quo.<p>In Amusing Ourselves to Death, Neil Postman claimed that Huxley was correct and Orwell was wrong: we're being oppressed by being drowned in irrelevant, trivial entertainment, not through censorship, explicit control and regulation. For the internet age, this idea is out of date. Today's form of control isn't making us passive, instead, it makes us active in ways that further the interests of power. We're told our creativity is subversive, even radical and revolutionary and therefore deeply significant, and yet nothing really changes. What's most interesting about all this supposedly disruptive change is how in the end, it's purpose is for the exact opposite: the smooth functioning of global capitalism.<p>Perhaps you can argue that this is a good thing, but it's impossible to argue that anything truly revolutionary is happening. Steve Jobs and Apple are not necessarily good, but they are a kind of progress because they demonstrate that the emperor has no clothes - the supposed revolutionary, world-changing potential of technology is a sham, it's the same old capitalism as usual.",1275590777

1402105,comment,1401914,1401914,0,0,famfam,,,"Thanks for the responses so far folks. It's interesting, because I raised this idea in a separate thread, and there was a lot of ""i'd use that"" kind of responses. Glad I'm double checking... :)<p>My initial thought (and maybe my MVP proposal does not reflect this) was to bring some of the features that things like Gomez offers (detail timing, screen caps, transactional walkthroughs, etc) down into the pricing space of the lower end offerings. I've worked for a large internet retailer before where we used Gomez - talking tens of thousands of dollars a year for just a few tests. Ridiculous. But having used it, at least on our site, I can say that it was definitely the fine grained monitoring that saved our asses -- things would NEVER outright 50x, just fail in really subtle/glitchy ways. Maybe it was because our system was for more complicated than Johnny PHP/Rails. IMHO 50x means the network is down, the IT guy unplugged something, you're getting DDOS'd or your system is just inherently unstable. It never meant ""Apache died"" - because Apache never did die, for years and years. Maybe I'm wrong to try to take ""head"" features and push them down to ""tail"" pricing.<p>Perhaps I could try to create a higher level offering that's still more affordable than Gomez. I don't know what that pricepoint would be though. Watchmouse has a transactional/clickthrough offering for $500/month. They look hard to compete with - their offering is quite robust. As for other offerings, I don't know. They don't tend to publicize a lot of their pricing, seem to have a not-so-self-service sales cycle.<p>I don't see the point of trying to create a ""cheaper than cheap"" option and competing with the simple-ping tail.<p>I guess I just though I saw an opportunity where some people may be getting greedy with their margins, and thought I could fill in that hole with an offering that was equivalent where it mattered, but at a much lower price point. Low enough where people in the tail would maybe even step up into it. Perhaps the world is perfectly happy in a bimodal setup - the ""<$5/mo ping and L7 check against one URL"" type of monitoring and the "">$x,000 or $x0,000 year total solution"" type of monitoring.",1275590764

Sometimes needed also after you have been on antibiotics (especially those with a wider spectrum of germ fighting abilities).  Another simpler and faster way of making yogurt is:
- Heat 1/2 galon of whole milk to 131 F (55C) 
- Wisk in a yogurt and VSL#3 (which is a great mix of live cultures - no required but definitely better - VSL#3 only available in some pharmacies though - call ahead).
- Preheat a large cooker with a cover by boiling water at max temp in it for 15 minutes.  That will kill all bad bacteria in it.  
- Empty the water and place the milk mix in glass jars in the cooker and close the top off.
- 12 hours later you have fantastic yogurt which you can kee in the fridge for up to 10 days.

I see it as purposely strong language used for emphasis.<p>I'm thinking more of the relationship between the employer and employee; ultimately you rent your time in exchange for money, which arguably for the majority of people is just enough to live their lives with some greater or lesser luxury, but ultimately doing unpleasant work which, though of course to some degree is necessary and serves society, is largely in place to make rich owners richer. A large mass of population simply acts within a confined system as 'slave wages' servicing the needs of the rich while only subsiding at a certain living standard.<p>I am contrasting this with those of us (and ultimately this probably applies to far fewer HN'ers than the general public) who find a way out, i.e. find value in our work beyond that of its means to provide us with an income, or in fact become one of the rich ourselves.<p>This is not a criticism of capitalism either, especially since I personally believe capitalism is the best means of distributing wealth, assuming controls are in place to prevent abuses.",1275588494

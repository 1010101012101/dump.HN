78584,comment,78248,78248,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"Actually, in High school, my entire grade level/class of 2009 uses a forum board I made. We trade study guides and by the time the test comes, everyone answers the same things. If the class average is low, we get a curve. Otherwise, we're all happy. The internet is indeed revolutionizing things. Of course, then theres always that class geek who kills the curve, but its not that often.<p>And yeah I totally agree with this post. My father is a Computer Science professor and he's friggin pissed with the corruption of the entire school system. He got rated down for failing a student and a lot of crap...a lot of undo stress<p>",1194838578

78582,comment,78472,78472,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I like doing complex things that require your full attention or you die. Stuff like rock-climbing (although I'm too out of shape to do that) Strenuous hiking is great -- wish I did more of it. The trick is that if you have an analytical and goal-intensive mind, like I suppose many of us do, you may have to try some unusual things to beat it into neutral gear.<p>\nI've found that even out of shape old farts like me can get the same results by simply raising your pulse to about 80-90% of max for an hour or so. If you do this using smart exercise equipment, it does all the work of figuring out how hard you should be working. Somewhere around minute 20 or so I find myself relaxing mentally, although the physical part is a little painful. Your mind begins to wander. At this point, once you're used to it, you can easily slip into a very meditative state. Focus on a point, recite a mantra, relax your mind. This reminds me of the same feeling I had when I ran, except you don't get the great feeling of being outdoors. On the good side, you don't have to worry about dogs, traffic, or slippery roads.<p>\nBest thing about all of that is that you get a great endorphin rush when you're done for the next few hours.<p>\nMy problem is that I'm always trying to hack my way out of relaxing -- using less time, gulping a Red Bull instead of doing my workout, etc. I'm slowly learning that this isn't something you can take shortcuts with, but it's a lesson I have a hard time with. I guess my mindset is that if you can make a computer do something really cool in ten minutes you should be able to hack your body-mind the same way, but it doesn't work like that.",1194838300

78573,comment,78472,78525,0,0,papersmith,,,"Running works great for me for several reasons:<p>1) It's got a fairly flat learning curve.<p>2) The rewards are immediate and gradual, but clearly noticeable.<p>3) It's relatively cheap, though you can't cheap out on shoes if you are going to run on cement.  A good pair usually costs over $100, but you can get them for half the price online if you know your size for a particular model.<p>4) It's convenient.  However, you do need access to a shower afterwards.<p>5) You can do it alone or with someone else, at any time you want.<p>That being said, I found taichi to work just as well in clearing the brain, but you don't get the endorphin rush or the cardiovascular improvements as much.",1194837043

78571,comment,78514,78514,0,0,apathy,,,"Good analysis.  I've been thinking this for a while, but the write-up crystallized the reasons.  If you want my services, you'll know it, and you won't be hesitant to pay for them.  (I've had the strange experience of a client whom I billed at $125/hour send me a tip for saving their business... in 5 hours)  LinkedIn is useful for surveying the landscape, but I generally know beforehand whether I'm likely to obtain a job, though I'm always game to look around.  (I am currently in graduate school, but I'm trying to collect enough data to build a regression model for deciding how long I can afford to spend on my dissertation before the opportunity cost catches up with the forward earnings differential.)<p>Bottom line -- unless you're taking the big risk and starting a company (congratulations and good luck!), the truth has always been the same.  It's not what you know.  It's not even who you know.  It's who knows what you know, and their perception of your value, that will make the biggest difference in your career (again, this is far less important to serial entrepreneurs).  <p>Thanks to transburgh for submitting this.  I can now point people at this page when the topic of LinkedIn and professional 'networks' comes up. \n",1194836860

Here's her (entertaining) reply:<p><i>...as for your question, you have definitely asked the right person. The idea about the left and right hemispheres comes from my old phd supervisor. The guy is awesome but completely insane. I can guarantee it has absolutely nothing to do with hemispheres, but it is a very cool illusion anyway.  The idea is published, though, so if you wanted it for some crazy trivia question you could use it, but nobody in science believes the idea...</i><p><i>If you did want to use the fact.. the more interesting fact is the experiments that he used to work it out. It is called caloric stimulation and involves injecting freezing cold water into someone's ear, with the aim of activating the other hemisphere (I was a subject and it hurts like hell and then your eyes start spinning around and you feel seasick).  So my boss Jack worked out that if you squirt freezing water into someone's ear they tend to see it go one way rather than the other.  He also published (citing personal observations) that the only thing that stops rivalry is laughter, sneezing and orgasm..  he says that during these three events you end up seeing a combination of the two images... the guy is crazy!</i>\n",1194836486

Did they assign a bunch of php developers to do this? What really caused this failure?<p>The fact they are using the technology as a scapegoat for their own incompetence is a pretty dishonest way of going about shifting the blame for their failures away from themselves, but I'm not one to believe in company wide conspiracies.<p>I think it is more likely that this whole thing probably got escalated by a bunch of ""web"" developers who were in over their head and decided to blame the technology stack and escalate that message to management, instead of the truth, which is that they messed up really really bad!<p>Don't blame the technology, blame the implementation!<p>edit: some minor edits to the phrasing of a few sentences.",1347735030
4526928,comment,4526609,4526609,27,0,psykotic,,,"I remember re-deriving this a few years ago. Short answer: If x = 2^n then rsqrt(x) = 2^(-n/2), so the exponent just gets negated and divided by 2. If x = (1 + m) 2^n where |m| < 1 is the fractional part of the mantissa, then rsqrt(1 + m) = 1 + rsqrt'(1) m + O(m^2) = 1 - m/2 + O(m^2) is the first-order Taylor expansion around 1. Thus rsqrt(x) ~= (1 - m/2) 2^(-n/2) so both m and n get negated and divided by 2.<p>This immediately suggests getting an initial guess for Newton's method by just shifting the bitwise form of an IEEE-754 floating point number by 1 and then doing some fix-ups for the negation.<p>The only hitch is that the exponent is stored in biased form rather than 2's complement form, so you have to first subtract out the bias, do the shift, and add back in the bias. Also, shifting can cause a least-significant 1 bit from the exponent to shift down into the most significant bit of the mantissa. But that turns out to be useful since it amounts to using the approximation sqrt(2) ~= 1.5. But doing all these bitwise operations is a lot of extra work compared to just doing a single shift. It turns out you can get almost the same effect with just a single addition of an immediate operand. Most of the bits of this addend are already predetermined by the need to handle the biasing and unbiasing in the exponent, and the remainder can easily be determined by brute force (the search space is only of size 2^24 or so) by just minimizing the approximation error over some test set. Doing that, I was able to converge to almost exactly the same 'magic number' as in Carmack's method.<p>My coworker Charles Bloom has a series of posts on this and related matters: <a href=""http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2010/11/11-20-10-function-approximation-by_20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2010/11/11-20-10-function-ap...</a><p>Here's an old email exchange I had with another coworker last time I was thinking about this stuff, where I tried to derive as many bits of the constant as possible by reasoning: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/4e1d0dff97193fe5d745"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/4e1d0dff97193fe5d745</a><p>Historical aside: How this algorithm came to be associated with Carmack is an amusing and roundabout tale. My partner in crime on Telemetry at RAD is Brian Hook. Hook was one of the first employees at 3dfx, where he designed and implemented the GLIDE graphics API. Gary Tarolli was the co-founder and CTO at 3dfx, and Hook got the rsqrt code from him. When Hook left 3dfx to work with Carmack on Quake 2 and 3 at id software, he brought that code with him and copied it into the codebase. Carmack never had anything to do with it. It's my recollection Tarolli didn't develop the algorithm either--he had gotten it from someone else in turn.",1347735024

It's not really meant to be a criticism of Python itself, it's just behavior that is common among 20-something web developers, which is representative of some areas of the industry, and is specifically the target audience for the post.  You know, the kind of developer that is advanced enough that they can build non-trivial projects, but not experienced enough to have wisdom forged in the furnaces of years of industry experience (that's ... me and a lot of other HN users).  The same type of attitude can be found in all languages and isn't specific to the Python community; the specific swipes at other languages are just what you get if you apply that attitude to Python.  Judging people by the tools they use is a pretty useless metric.<p>>For the record, I think Haskell is a strictly superior choice to Go<p>I'm pretty sure it's the best programming language, that's why I put them in the gray-beard category.  Or maybe it's OCaml or some Lisp dialect; it doesn't really matter.  It's even why I further apologized to Dons and acknowledged that Haskell programmers tend to be able to solve harder problems than other programmers I know, but even after I twice acknowledged the superiority of Haskell, he basically just looked at me and said ""you're a stupid idiot, and by the way, look at how many numbers I can compute with my superior Haskell program that runs on a lot of machines"".  Uh, ok, that's cool... I guess.<p>But every time I sit down with Haskell programmers and they explain to me how elegant their code is, I just don't really care.  It's not what makes me interested in computer programming.  I don't really care to use the best programming language; I really only care to make the best programs.  PHP (and other shit technologies) have shown us that you don't need to understand monads to make people happy.<p>A friend of mine, who is a very strong programmer that I have a tremendous amount of respect for professionally, once showed me how to use Coq to prove that multiplication is commutative.  I found that very boring, and it didn't make me want to learn Coq.  Mind you, I spend between 40 and 60 hours a week working with software.  I'm in it because I like to build things that are useful to people, and I think software is a great creative medium.  I think that's a fairly common attitude.<p>Every time I say the name Haskell I am sorry for it, because every time I say the name Haskell I am met with bitter condescension.  It makes me sad that despite talking about having experience with seven programming languages in my post, or mentioning having built a variety of things that are very different, Haskell programmers consistently treat me like I am a stupid person.  So I'm glad you're not like that, and I'm glad that you understood I didn't mean to dismiss Haskell on technical grounds.  Thank you for your comment.",1347734862

It imposes a fairly large cost, not just in terms of performance, but also in terms of complexity. You have to deal with a network protocol just to display things on the screen. No other windowing system imposes this level of cost on the developer, and it can be argued that the reason we never got a Linux desktop was because of X. Simply put, Apple showed us what could be done with a Unix system if you abandon X and set allow your GUI API to talk directly to the hardware.

Therefore, the Bible is totally fiction, but teaches moderately useful lessons, so long as we understand the figurative language it's using.""<p>(late 1800s, Fundamentalism): ""What?  You guys are quacks.  The King James Bible is totally reliable because God specially preserved it.  Therefore, there's no figurative language whatsoever, everything is literal.""<p>It's my perception that Fundamentalism's influence is waning; I run into far fewer ""fundies"" than I did during my childhood (but I live in the same house and attend the same church.)  In surveys I've seen, a lower percentage of people self-identify as Fundamentalist, and a lower percentage agree with certain key Fundamentalist doctrines.

The bicycle is not the complete solution. compared to a board. Their actually huge. you rarely see a cubical that you could fit a bike in and most businesses don't have showers after your sweating bike ride to work. I think a board/public transit solution is a huge step.<p>1) Choosing your house or apartment: If you could board a couple miles to any type of public transit stop this decision really opens up. I emphasize ANY public transit stop. Some buses can only hold 2 bikes, and have you ever lugged your bike onto Caltrain. They really haven't learned anything from Europe about ergonomics of a train stop. Sometimes you have to lug your bike up 4 feet of stairs onto one of those trains. The board is light and small and EVERYONE on the bus or train could have one. And think how it open your transit schedule planing to choose from stops in a couple mile radius. The rent you can save from this decision will pay for your board.\n2) Cubical space: How sweet is it that you could park your board next to your desk? I'm totally getting one of those hooks from the kickstarter video.\n3) No sweat: Sure, I guess you could get a (massive) electric bike, but frankly who wants an electric bike? Not cool. The zero sweat solution to your commute would be one of these boards. I'm sure you and your colleagues would prefer if your didn't sit in meetings covered in and smelling of sweat from your morning ride. You'll have to get the exercise somewhere else.",1347733415

They theoretically have the power to enforce such a restriction but choose not to in order to cover their ass. Considering the various payouts they've made to governments for telling OEMs what to do, it's hard to blame them.<p>However it is Google's fault because they have no such restriction with Android. As the scuttled Acer Alibaba launch demonstrated, Google has no qualms about exercising its power in a potentially destructive way to bully their partners into toeing the line.<p>They get final approval of what ships on the phone, the design, and the changes to Android. If they don't like what they see, they can revoke access to the core Google apps like Gmail and Market, making it essentially an AOSP device. The Skyhook investigation taught us all that.<p>So in other words, Google has the power. They use the power frequently. They also are not in legal hot water over exercising the power. However, they won't exercise the power to benefit you because they value their close relationship with carriers way more than they value you as a customer. Mainly because you're not really a customer, as an Android user you're the product being sold to advertisers.<p>There is no reason to give Google a pass on this one. They are the only ones with the power to stop carrier and manufacture bloatware from ruining the phone, and they deliberately choose to ignore it because maintaining relationships with hardware partners and carriers is more important to them than your experience with the phone.

4526801,comment,4496051,4497703,2,0,todayiamme,,,"I think you're right. My original argument was that when you step inside the mind of someone who does something like this and examine their motives, then you come up with a series of whys. Why are they doing it? Why not just rape/molest the child in private behind closed doors? Clearly there won't be any photographic evidence lying around of their acts in that particular case making the prosecution's case weaker. A part of the reason why they do it because they have a need to perform and every performer needs an audience.<p>Given how controversial the subject matter is it might seem that I'm making a blanket statement to further my own objectives, but this is more of an observation rather than a conclusion. Why they do it is unclear and up for debate, but the fact that they are doing it isn't. The scenarios you have mentioned did not have this component in them. In those cases the harm is a probabilistic function requiring several requisite conditions to be completed. (someone has to be driving, the speed must be high and so on) A series of things must go wrong and the probability of occurrence isn't 1. On the other hand over here someone must be hurt and I assumed that there must be a psychological feedback mechanism which kicked in for the rapist when people consumed the said matter. That's why I thought it was more reasonable to assert that there is a function of the viewer in the crime itself and that it was a part of the motivations behind the crime.<p>However what I had forgotten was that correlation does not imply causation and all of this is orthogonal to the actual crime itself. Therefore, I was wrong and you were right. Possession is indeed a victimless crime.<p>Now we have that fact settled it is indeed an open question where there will be net good or net harm given legalisation or ban. That's a rather difficult question to answer and I do not have the skills or the understanding to broach upon it. However, I think that over here the answer isn't as simple complete legalisation or ban, but rather some X thing in combination with more sophisticated enforcement to catch the perpetrators.<p>>>> Anders Breivik no doubt enjoyed the media attention and I didn't hear voices calling for his manifesto to become illegal to spread.<<<<p>Again that's a completely orthogonal incident to what is being discussed.

We can make a (finite) program that follows that mapping, and hence it has to be possible at least in terms of a finite-length program.<p>I disagree with the middle assumption: some of those will persuade me the AI is conscious.

These numbers are from Nielsen Social Media Report Q3 2011 (I have no reason to trust these number particularly, it's just the first non-anecdotal data I found with a search).<p>Both the lack of overlap with your list, and the the low usage numbers for even the most popular <i>categories</i> of apps (let alone specific apps), should make it completely obvious that people's usage scenarios are completely different.<p>b) If you seriously dispute the presence of ecosystem lock-in that means apps in the same category are not fungible, there's no point in having a discussion. Even your own list has WhatsApp that can't be substituted to by any other instant messaging app. Its utility depends purely on your contacts using the app too. Something like iMessage, or BBM, or Google Voice might be in a similar category of usage, but they can't replace WhatsApp for you.<p>Another example you had was an ebook reader. Again, for a lot of people a generic ebook reader is of little use, since they're already tied into the Kindle ecosystem. While presumably for you the Kindle app is of no use as well.<p>The prime example of this is InstaGram. Yes, anyone could build a camera app with a fake polaroid filter. But 50 million people wouldn't install it. All of the value of the app was in the ecosystem.<p>And the list here is seemingly endless.<p>The harsh reality is that these apps are not getting ported over to every single platform. Can FxOS become an important enough platform that it warrants porting to? Maybe. But it almost certainly needs to become an important platform first. And becoming a major platform without having the apps is tough. Hell, even getting a good review for a device without the apps is going to be tough. See e.g. reviews for the Nokia N9, Lumia 900 (and we're talking WP7 here!), any Android tablet.<p>c) Let me turn this around. Where do you think a good mapping solution for FxOS is going to come from?",1347732495

It is pretty apparent with the behavior of typical commuter boarders vs. bicyclists that they know which is safer. Most cyclists on streets actually don't wear helmets. Most boarders do.<p>With regards to breaking when you don't have a rock, curb, door in your face...You can program anti-lock braking into an electronically controlled breaking system. If you have enough understanding of the friction of the rider to the board and the boarder is experienced enough to know how position themselves during braking, that system should win as it can avoid skidding. Regarding experience level: on a bike it takes some experience not to just use the front brake only and drop your head on the pavement.<p>Until we see some stats about which group actually sustains more serious injuries, commuter bicyclists or commuter boosted boarders, the jury is still out.",1347732345

Then you tell everyone in a negative room to move to room n-1 and everyone in a positive room to move to room n+1.<p>However, this definition does away with the idea of a ring meeting itself on the other side.

This argument is simply a special case of that.<p>Mapping strings to strings is an uncountable infinity (it's the powerset of countable infinities).  All possible machine programs are a countable infinity (since any given source program is finite).  The argument ""give me an output other than what any of these programs would give"" mimics the diagonalization step -- it demonstrates that, whatever is in the infinite list of possible AI programs, you can construct string mappings that none of the AI programs would have constructed.<p>Yet a strong AI should be able to construct any string mapping whatsoever.  Thus, ""strong AI"" and ""running finite source code"" are necessarily incompatible.  (We do not know whether human programming is enumerable; thus, we cannot draw the analogy you attempted to draw.)<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument</a>",1347732132

Union electricians must be hired (minimum one hour) to plug in a simple power strip.  If your booth requires more than two hours to set up, you are required to hire (glacially slow) union laborers.  We made it under the rules with one of those presto-setup tinkertoy-like lattice structures, only to find in the morning that someone ran over part of it with forklift.  There are absurd rules about who can stand on the floor exhibiting; salaried employees only, otherwise you have to hire ""professionals"" out of their union pool.<p>Trade shows are a scam.  Now that I'm an entrepreneur, I will <i>never</i> exhibit my business at one of these events.

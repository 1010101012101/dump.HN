There's plenty of good journalism to be done with just an internet connection, a phone and an inquiring mind, as long as you know you will be reimbursed.
At least I'd like to think so :-)",1244109460

Apparently, Google is better than humans at interpreting text :)<p>PS: I am not sure if place where Alan Turing was conceived is an apt information. Why would anyone want to know that?",1244109354

641163,comment,640859,641011,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>Imagine we had very low taxes, but the state did not build roads</i><p>No need to imagine. Businesses existed a long time before the state ever got around to building roads. Businesses seem to exist just fine without much government intervention at all -- so well, in fact, that one of government's roles is to prevent monopolies.<p>This whole ""government provides infrastructure so businesses should be happy to have it"" presumes that the infrastructure the government is providing is the best and most efficient use of the dollars in question for that particular business. That's a really big assumption.",1244108854

641157,comment,640957,640983,0,0,petercooper,,,"I'd say the problem isn't with asking quirky questions, but with idiotic employers who expect their staff to be unrealistic, dishonest automatons.<p>No-one's perfect. We all ask stupid questions, many of us have crazy things in our online profiles, and we've all gone off the rails at some level or another. Employers who want to  see people who are 100% ""proper"" all the time at their interviews are idiots.<p>And, no, I have no problem with employers like these pulling up this very message and reading it back to me in the future because I'll know they're not worth working for. Smart employers use smart criteria.",1244108362

Vista anyone?<p>While the paper gives hope that it is up on the radar, I suspect it may be some time before we see any widespread adoption of the ideas - we're talking a paradigm shift in an ego-centric industry...<p>However, a great find!

The OS has a 1.02.1 version (and has, for some time, it was patched in Dec 2013), but you have to make your own Docker build which will dynamically link to it.<p>Take a look at your version of libdevmapper, and you should be able to see if there will be a problem; what I&#x27;ve heard is that CentOS and RHEL also have a fixed version of devicemapper, which causes the mis-match and creates the problem outlined in the #4036 issue.<p>The ideal fix is to actually compile Docker on an Ubuntu (RHEL) OS when building the Ubuntu (RHEL) packages, but what&#x27;s actually happening is that it&#x27;s being built in a minimal Linux container - which gives it a different version.",1435006552

But &quot;Its judges like these that should be taken out back and shot&quot; isn&#x27;t a serious threat; it is, in fact, a figure of speech.<p>Do you want to systematize the &quot;reasonable person&quot; reasoning here? What are all the factors you might consider in making the assessment? I&#x27;ll start a list:<p>1. Lack of stated intent --- someone <i>should</i> be shot, not I am <i>going</i> to shoot.<p>2. Lack of specific planning or details anywhere in the comments. Someone should be shot tomorrow when they come to court at 8:30AM, vs. simply &quot;someone should be shot&quot;.<p>3. The rhetorical-or-true threat is a single isolated comment from the commenter, not a pattern of comments from that person over time (people make sockpuppets, of course, but the mere act of diffusing a threat over a bunch of sockpuppets argues against it being a true threat).<p>4. The &quot;threat&quot; echoes a previous comment on the same forum, as in &quot;no, don&#x27;t shoot the person out back, do it out front so everyone can see&quot; or &quot;no, don&#x27;t use a gun, use a wood chipper&quot;.<p>5. Obviously: extravagant and silly modes of violence, like wood chippers, or dropping anvils on heads.<p>6. Jocular tone, or even, really, any non-deliberative non-serious non-specific tone in a comment that shares a forum with previous silly suggestions.<p>You could flunk all these tests and still not come anywhere near a &quot;true threat&quot;, but I&#x27;d argue that opening a formal investigation and collecting evidence and issuing subpoenas for comments that flunk <i>any</i> of them is abusive.

It&#x27;s a pretty short book and he doesn&#x27;t go into too much exposition on a lot of the issues he addresses, with the exception of debt. He probably spends half of the already short book on talking about the evils of debt, especially debt put into things that aren&#x27;t assets. It&#x27;s not the debt that is the problem, it&#x27;s the mindset you have to be in to take the debt, the mindset that the debt puts you in, and the mindset of the type of person that continues to use debt, especially destructively. There are some closely related issues with spending money, which tie in nicely.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting read. This book was written in 1880, and if not for the dated writing style, would fit right in to the modern day self-help genre.

Your argument rests on the implicit assumption that employees will leave the moment they receive a competitive offer and are only interested in maximizing the take-home pay aspect of their economic advantage. Employees are motivated by a combination of monetary compensation, benefits, and good will towards a firm in the same way that a firm is valued by both its book assets and its good will in the marketplace. You assume, without foundation, that employee loyalty towards an employer that provides training will be nil, and ignores the possibility that employees might look forward to receiving future training (and promotions) which would have significant economic value, whereas a firm that poaches employees and offers no training of its own presumably won&#x27;t be offering any in future either.<p><i>If an investment can&#x27;t be protected it&#x27;s pointless to make it.

I hope that this continues and only worsens for these people.<p>That &#x27;climate of fear&#x27; also exists for those people who don&#x27;t fall into such cleanly vilifiable categories, and yet occasionally engage in language and behavior that could be categorized as such, often unknowingly because those definitions seem to depend on contexts they cannot determine, have different meanings for each individual, and are rapidly being expanded to encompass broader categories of thought and behavior.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m happy for many reasons.</i> The first is that it has, as you&#x27;ve said, made privileged people afraid. I think this is only the beginning. Privilege creates safety, and as it is removed, I think the unsafety of the oppressed will in part come to the currently privileged classes. But if I could flip a switch and make every man feel the persistent, gnawing fear that a woman has of men, I would in a heartbeat. <i>I wouldn&#x27;t even consider whether the consequences were strategic, I would just do it.</i><p>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed about the fearful is that they tend to resent the fearless, and want everyone to live under the same fears they do. It&#x27;s a very primal thing, as people who fear the same things are part of the same tribe. These fears are not used to achieve anything strategic, but to define the very culture members exist in, and so are vigorously spread and defended regardless of any practical value they may have. <i>In such a culture you will never get beyond that fear.</i> You can see this most readily in religious sects, but many political movements are little other than that.<p>And regardless of the &#x27;harm&#x27; fear prevents, it is still the antithesis of <i>knowledge</i>, and a society ruled by fear cannot be ruled by knowledge. In such a society knowledge itself is a threat, and the only people willing to discuss controversial ideas will either be the ones courageous enough to question or hateful enough not to care. The fearful of course will not be able to tell the difference.<p>Personally, that is not a price I am willing to pay for a &#x27;safe&#x27; society. That doesn&#x27;t mean such a system is right or wrong, only that it doesn&#x27;t align with my values. But regardless of differing values, it still troubles me that anyone would take such joy in other people&#x27;s fear and unsafety, and I don&#x27;t think any good can come of that.<p>> So if discourse is permanently removed as a tactical and strategic option for future leftists, I&#x27;ll consider it a victory.<p>And yet here you are, using a throwaway account to engage in tactically and strategically driven discourse.",1435005288

Apple&#x27;s 2013 iPhone 5S still has lower power use and more processing power the current Samsung phones because Apple invested in chip design and shipped an AArch64 chip Samsung can&#x27;t match even with two years (1.33 Moore&#x27;s Law cycles) of process upgrades and access to Apple&#x27;s tapeouts.<p>Apple&#x27;s screen process is still brighter with more faithful colors.

Apple still has better control over power consumption and background processing in its OS.

The Nexus 5 was the last inexpensive high quality pure Android effort and it wasn&#x27;t profitable. Motorola wasn&#x27;t worth keeping. Android is good enough to keep Apple and Microsoft from squeezing Google off the net and that&#x27;s all Google needs. Google hasn&#x27;t even updated Android to take advantage of AArch64 which cripples all the Android phone makers against Apple.<p>Ultimately, Google knows that they can&#x27;t compete against Apple because carriers have contempt for quality. No other maker but Apple has loyal and lucrative customers that will switch carriers to keep using Apple devices. Thus no other manufacturer has leverage to get the best quality devices it can make to users. Carriers want your phone crippled because they dream of controlling you and governments hand them monopolies so they can control your device maker.<p>The result is that only Apple can make a top flight device. And therefore they can use monopoly price discrimination tactics to bleed extra money from you for 64GB.<p>It beats the alternative which is carriers ruining all devices including Apple.

At this very moment as I write this email I am still under DEA surveillance. Let me be clear, not investigation. But surveillance. Their investigation is over, because they have caught who they want. My aim is to get the word out and protect the privacy and rights of all American citizens.<p>My friend and artist AO has been under DEA investigation. He comes here to write, thus my house has been under DEA investigation. Basically the DEA is using Facebooks software and some other devices that I have not been able to identify in order to surveil my house. A DEA agent currently resides in my house and I am able to communicate with the agents through some sort of fluke. I know this sounds crazy, but I am able to pick up their communication system with my mind. It&#x27;s like a receiver. I thought I might be going crazy, but the apartment building where they are based is above my backyard. Their voice projects into my backyard like a sound-box. That was my physical confirmation. Other illegal DEA activities during this process include: Black Hat Hacking (On Sunday June 21, 2015 between the hours of 7PM to June 22, 2015 12PM. Websites include Hacker News, Americas Political Chat Room, LinkedIN, also I had a shifting url when I tried to access my Google Contacts at 9:59PM), Invasion of privacy (Recording my girlfriend and I having sex), Conspiracy (Not just with Facebook. But I believe other companies are involved. The only other one I could identify was At&T. They are my service provider. And I am not under investigation. So they needed a warrant to trace my phone. My friend and artist AO was picked up because I called him to wish him a happy fathers day.) There is probably so much more. I just got lucky and caught a signal, and began my investigation.

The only relevant difference from lambda-calculus is that C functions must be named, cannot be nested and must exist at compile time. But conceptually these restrictions make little difference to the understanding of what lambda does: it creates a function.<p>Finally writing something like that (to the extent that the requirements make sense) is gonna be really painful in C.

Let&#x27;s say you run something like:<p><pre><code>    $ sudo pflask --user=some_user ...\n</code></pre>\nSince you are running pflask as root (sudo ...), pflask will map the &quot;root&quot; user outside of the container to the &quot;some_user&quot; user inside the container.<p>The whole point of this feature was the possibility of running pflask as non-root, so you could map a normal user on the host to the root user inside the container and still be able to call mount() (although there are several limitations), so it&#x27;s only possible to map one user right now, however it shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to add another option to map additional users (feel free to open a GitHub issue if you need this).",1435003641

The employee in question was trying to figure out why a remote server was experiencing extreme slowdown.  He ssh-ed in, but he was able to type far faster than the beleaguered remote could echo his keystrokes.  So he needed to just <i>carefully</i> type his commands, wait for them to appear, and then press enter.   Instead, he typed angrily and too quickly, swore at the connection, and eventually started slamming his keyboard in a fit of pique.<p>It was a totally reasonable real-world slow machine problem, and a totally useful insight into the mindset of a potential new employee.<p>Not egregious at all.

However algebra is of indirect help <i>if</i> you want to learn category theory, because the latter is a direct generalisation of the former. It is rather difficult for a non-mathematician to pick up category theory from scratch without having first seen the the algebra that category theory abstracts from. Universal properties, category theory&#x27;s most important concept, appears  bizarre and disconnected from reality, unless you have seen it working in the much simpler settings of groups, rings, modules etc.<p>To that caveat, I&#x27;d like to add that neither Rotman nor Birkhoff/MacLane are ideal places to start learning algebra. There are plenty of gentler, more modern books. In terms of tomes that are available online, I can recommend Shoup&#x27;s &quot;A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra&quot; [1].<p>As an aside, note that category theory is used only in the part of programming language research that is about (pure) functional programming. In other sub-fields (e.g. OO, logic programming and concurrency), category theory has not so far proven terribly useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shoup.net/ntb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shoup.net/ntb/</a>",1435003388

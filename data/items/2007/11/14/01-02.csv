79615,comment,79232,79471,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I've heard anecdotes from multiple sources that there are groups of software engineers and algorithm designers buried deep inside all the major firms that are doing just this. I know those firms manage and create hundreds of billions of dollars and I've been told that the stiffest competition is in these tiny software components of the business.<p>But I don't mean to sound too snarky. Sorry about that. So go ahead and try to get a job at Machine Insight or another such firm to find out what they're all about.\n<a href=""http://www.machineinsight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.machineinsight.com/</a>\n",1195005334

Don't forget the history. Codd wanted Alpha, but politics at IBM is what gave us SQL. Once SQL started rolling, it's what stuck.",1195004629

79610,comment,79253,79253,0,0,nsimpson,,,"""What IBM did was to create a piece of hardware which everyone bought into. And built it out of generic enough parts that it could be cloned. I'm not sure who the equivalent player this time around."" <p>-- I don't think there is an equivalent to IBM in the handset market.  <p>IBM had a powerful steamroller when it came to branding, sales and cash - most people hopped on the PC Compatible standard (including DOS) because it was the ""sure thing"".  Not because DOS was inherently more open than, say, CP/M.<p>Google has a similar steamroller (at least in the respect that to a lot of people, Google = Internet) but unless most  people are demanding a ""Google Phone"" then handset makers aren't going to fall over themselves to hand over their lunch to google.<p>Google and the developer community will have to build something pretty incredible and build a lot of mind-share with the general public, I think.\n",1195004369

79603,comment,78933,79035,0,0,aswanson,,,"Sorry, I didn't address the 80k hopefuls.  I would say that given the economic trends (ee is easier to outsource than software and is being replaced by it) that the long-term growth prospects don't look good salary wise.<p>The 80 k entry salaries are dubious unless they plan on using their school name to get a non-ee  high paying job (read consulting, hedge fund, finance, etc).  60 is probably more realistic in my area (mid-Atlantic east coast) at the high-end entry level.  In the most inflated market (the valley), seems like 100k is reasonable after 3-5 years experience (non consulting). A lot of them want advanced degrees. Of course, most of the jobs are software: <a href=""http://seeker.dice.com/jobsearch/servlet/JobSearch?op=302&dockey=xml/7/f/7f413b489344c22e2b49a54e4ee175ff@endecaindex&source=19&FREE_TEXT=entry+level"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seeker.dice.com/jobsearch/servlet/JobSearch?op=302&#3...</a>",1195002509

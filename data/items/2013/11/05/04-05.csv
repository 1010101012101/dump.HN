Billion-dollar fighter jets may be a gravy train for the Pentagon and defense contractors, but they may not be all that useful in most war arenas the US is likely to encounter today.<p>Arguably the best illustration of this was the infamous &quot;Millennium Challenge 2002&quot;, a massive war game involving 13,000 troops and $250M. Embarrassingly, the US army got &quot;defeated&quot; within just the first few days by a ragtag bunch of fighters, propeller plans, recreational boats and low-tech communication.<p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/06/usa.iraq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/06/usa.iraq</a><p><i>&quot;At the height of the summer, as talk of invading Iraq built in Washington like a dark, billowing storm, the US armed forces staged a rehearsal using over 13,000 troops, countless computers and $250m. Officially, America won and a rogue state was liberated from an evil dictator.<p>What really happened is quite another story, one that has set alarm bells ringing throughout America&#x27;s defence establishment and raised questions over the US military&#x27;s readiness for an Iraqi invasion. In fact, this war game was won by Saddam Hussein, or at least by the retired marine playing the Iraqi dictator&#x27;s part, Lieutenant General Paul Van Riper.<p>In the first few days of the exercise, using surprise and unorthodox tactics, the wily 64-year-old Vietnam veteran sank most of the US expeditionary fleet in the Persian Gulf, bringing the US assault to a halt.<p>What happened next will be familiar to anyone who ever played soldiers in the playground. Faced with an abrupt and embarrassing end to the most expensive and sophisticated military exercise in US history, the Pentagon top brass simply pretended the whole thing had not happened. They ordered their dead troops back to life and &quot;refloated&quot; the sunken fleet. Then they instructed the enemy forces to look the other way as their marines performed amphibious landings. Eventually, Van Riper got so fed up with all this cheating that he refused to play any more. Instead, he sat on the sidelines making abrasive remarks until the three-week war game - grandiosely entitled Millennium Challenge - staggered to a star-spangled conclusion on August 15, with a US &quot;victory&quot;.&quot;</i>",1383627233

And that landlords are not allowed to interfere?&quot;</i><p>If someone&#x27;s renting an apartment, it&#x27;s by definition not &quot;their&quot; apartment but the landlord&#x27;s apartment. The landlord decides to rent to a particular tenant based on things like background checks, references, interviews, etc. These kind of assurances are not available for random people that the tenant rents to. Unless the tenant bears complete legal and financial liability for anything bad his subtenant does, it&#x27;s asking the landlord to take on a significant risk.<p>Also, if each tenant in a large building could rent their apartment to up to 8 separate groups of people, you would have a constant flow of strangers through the building. Since the short-term renters don&#x27;t have any stake in keeping the building clean or safe or quiet, this could pose problems for the other tenants. I&#x27;ve lived in apartments where even the long-term tenants left garbage in the halls and played loud music at 2am.

One critical element of controlling sea lanes is to control the air over those lanes. Since we don&#x27;t have aircraft carriers, we need aircraft that can fly a long way, penetrate naval air defences and shoot at enemy planes and ships.<p>It also matters in case of a straight up land invasion.

So US aviation can make use of the skies over the battlefield uncontested. A battle against an adversary who has those things (like Russia or China) would be different; the US would need to be able to seize control of the air, and hold it.<p>Small fighters would indeed play a key role in that process, because they would be the ones who would have to sweep the skies clean of enemy fighters so that other aircraft (bombers, transports, etc.) could travel through them safely. If the battle zone is inside the adversary&#x27;s air defense network, that would mean they&#x27;d have to be able to survive traveling through that network as well.<p>I would bet money that within thirty years this mission will be entirely handed over to UAVs/drones, since they&#x27;re cheaper to operate and actually have some advantages over manned fighters -- a drone can turn harder than a manned plane can, for instance, because it doesn&#x27;t have to worry about the G-forces killing the pilot. But technology is not quite there yet today.",1383624231

They probably don&#x27;t do this often and when they do it&#x27;s because there is some significant signal that means that the cost of asking you for this generally excessive information, outweighs possibly losing you as a customer because of some inherent risk they see on their side.<p>If you trust them with your credit card number, then I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t trust them with your identification as long as you are sure this is not a phishing scam of some sort. All the same, I&#x27;d still see if they would let you redact anything you are uncomfortable sharing (like the license # or address) Chances are that they just want to make sure you are definitely who you say you are, which a solid, scanned ID will help to confirm.<p>As a slightly unrelated aside: bartenders ask for your ID, so do some vendors when using a debit/credit card, so this is not completely crazy, obviously they don&#x27;t explicitly store it in digital form, which is probably where your concern comes from.",1383624216

He charged ~30% for doing it via Airbnb than the normal rents would have been. Then they raised rents more on apartments in the building. When I left ~4 out of 50 or so units were on Airbnb. Apartment next to me was a continuous ramble of people who left trash around and threw late parties(more than the normal residents).<p>I&#x27;m all for the idea of Airbnb, but there needs to be something in place that prevents this type of thing. Finding an apartment in NYC is rough enough, but artificially reducing supply via this type of thing causes the rent increases even more.<p>Taxing it seems like the only way to put the reverse pressure on landlords doing this, but I&#x27;m doubtful it will do enough.",1383624155

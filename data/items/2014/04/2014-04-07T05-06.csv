The two tests were one with an array of objects( contiguous array ) and the other an array of pointers to objects which were allocated separately. Then I iterated over the object doing some very simple operation( just enough to access it, and identical for each object ) and timed this. And of course I trashed the memory some more for each time.<p>The time taken ratio is:<p>array of objects : array of pointers to objects<p>1 : 1.189<p>The second test is identical except I made some extra effort to make sure that every object in array of pointers was not adjacent to any previous one in memory:<p>array of objects : array of pointers to objects<p>1 : 2.483<p>The difference got much smaller once the operation on each object became more time consuming.",1396849707

It&#x27;s a little lumpy, because it was made by adding together a bunch of different sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes (by the way, that slight overshoot/undershoot at the edges of the square wave? That&#x27;s the Gibbs phenomenon). When we look at a square wave in this form, with time running along the <i>x</i>-axis (like the display of an oscilloscope), we call it the &quot;time domain&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s hard to visualize the individual sine waves when they all overlap like that, so let&#x27;s spread them out. The logical &quot;direction&quot; in which to spread them is by frequency, so imagine spreading them out in the frequency dimension &quot;behind&quot; the square wave. When the graph rotates into three dimensions, we can see all the individual sine waves: in fact, there are six of them. (If we used more than six, the square wave would be less lumpy; fewer sine waves, more lumpy.)<p>Notice that the sine waves are different amplitudes, and discrete frequencies. We represent them by spikes on a graph where frequency runs along the <i>x</i>-axis (like the display of a frequency analyzer) and the height of each spike is the amplitude of the sine wave at that frequency.<p>We&#x27;ve transformed a square wave <i>f</i> in the time domain, into a spectrum <i>f</i>-hat with spikes of different positions and heights in the frequency domain. You can read the blue graph as &quot;six equally spaced frequencies with decreasing amplitudes&quot;. That&#x27;s the fourier transform of the original (red) signal. Because it&#x27;s a transform, it works in the other direction, too: begin with half a dozen signal generators, set their frequencies and amplitudes according to the spikes on the blue graph, add them together, and the result will be a square wave (or a reasonable facsimile thereof).<p>It can be done on signals of more than one dimension, too: take a cat photo, transform it into something that looks a bit like a starburst, then transform the starburst back into a photo of a cat.<p>Note: interesting and oftentimes useful things happen when you transform a time-domain signal into the frequency domain, erase some of the spikes, and then transform back into the time domain.",1396848176

This does limit you to performing asynchronous operations but most of the time that&#x27;s good enough. You do still end up with a scaling issue but because the users aren&#x27;t hitting that part of your system directly it&#x27;s easier to spread the load over time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html</a>",1396847080

Easy offline mobile apps.<p>This, if done well, could be awesome. How you would effectively guarantee row-level security?<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot is a database whose rows are only readable by the users that generated the data in those rows. Essentially, the data in each row is encrypted with a key that&#x27;s generated from the password of the user.<p>Data breaches are bad because, among other reasons, nothing in the database is encrypted. If each row was encrypted with a key only recoverable from a user&#x27;s password it would solve a lot of problems.",1396847013

SMS is so limited and expensive compared to the amount of data I can send over 3G/Wifi, in fact, frequently sending messages on my phone is now free, but with one tied to SMS/MMS it would <i>always</i> cost me money to use.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s hindsight being 20/20, but it just seems like a really strange direction to go in, so is there something other than the infrastructure and theoretical ease of use that drove your decision?",1396846958

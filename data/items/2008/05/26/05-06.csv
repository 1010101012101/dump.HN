I don’t know the security side as well as I should and I don’t have time to make sure everything is rock solid ...</i><p>Wow, nice to know that the basics of web security isn't in his understanding of web developer's job and apparently beyound what an ""evangelist"" should care about. If web developers ""do not have time"" to secure their own shit, why would the world need them?<p>Besides, what does he want? Google kills thousands of fake spamming sites an hour, how on earth would they implement his idea of ""heads up warning"" before wiping them off the index?<p>And what would Microsoft/Yahoo do? The same goddamn thing, because spamming sites degrade search quality which hurts us all in the end.",1211780118

199996,comment,199931,199931,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think you should do a little bit of research into motivation and the way trivial rewards effect returns.  People don't actually behave the way you think they do.<p>An interesting experiment in the field involved asking people on the street to assist in changing a flat tire.<p>When simply asked for help, the response was pretty high.  A significant number of people helped.<p>When offered a small cash payment (a few bucks), the positive response rate dropped dramatically.<p>When the cash payment was raised to something relatively sizable, like $50, the response went back up to about the same as just asking for help.<p>I won't try to explain this phenomenon (though I think there's the obvious fact that being paid a few pennies is far less satisfying than helping someone out of the kindness of your heart).  I believe the fundamental reason every single revenue sharing business has failed to take off (a few minor successes excluded) is because they fail to accept this bit of humor nature.  It's a pretty fundamental flaw, so it really ought to be taken into account.",1211778653
199995,comment,199722,199722,0,0,pfedor,,,"Anything by Greg Egan. It is a science fiction author who actually has a very good understanding of science (he's published articles in a scientific journal about quantum gravity) and makes non-trivial use of it in his plots. Plus, he's a computer programmer and you can go to his website and see a collection of applets, some of them illustrating the concepts from his novels and short stories. On top of that, he is good with all the soft stuff, like character development and psychology etc., that is essential for great fiction but that some science-intensive science fiction is very much lacking.<p>There are other very good nerd literature authors out there, like Vernor Vinge and Neal Stephenson, but to me none of them was as big a revelation as Greg Egan.<p>If you don't mind something non-mainstream and a bit dated, but first-class literature nonetheless, you can try Stanislaw Lem. It's a Polish author but most of his work has been translated to English. I consider him one of the best science fiction authors ever. ""The Star Diaries"" is light and funny, a perfect pool side reading.",1211778615

199989,comment,199690,199704,0,0,pk,,,"I like your summary of the talk. One subtly to his position that made the talk stand out for me was that he wasn't completely opposed to the top-down model for determining the weight of subjects in schools based on industry demands. Rather, his argument was that schools weren't keeping up with the needs of the industry they educate their students for. He seemed to be making the case that as an increasing number of the methodical aspects of industry become automated as technology progresses, problems which require more creativity such as determining ""what"" to make rather than ""how"" to make it become much more important.",1211778010

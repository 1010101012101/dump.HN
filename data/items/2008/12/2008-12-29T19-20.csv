In most russian cities, housing stock is in very short supply (thanks to the legacy of centralized city planning) and people often stay together because otherwise they would have nowhere to live. I believe this skews the statistic in favor of the US, i.e. I believe that the russian divorce rates would be even higher if more people were able to live separately.",1230580741

Granted, it is very hard to get inflection from text, and this strikes me as one of those emotional appeals where inflection matters, but his saying that he <i>just</i> wants a stable until retirement job suggests that he is willing to kick enjoyability (and possibly a number of other things) to the curb for the sake of that. He wants it, but he's willing to accept that he can't always have it. It is here that I think he goes horribly wrong.

Accepting and/or work just to work, without enjoyment or fulfillment, is one of those places where I think your advice is worth following.",1230580164

But that won't fool anyone for long. ;)<p>The tricks for improving your resume are well known and are covered in all the books. Learn something about the business you're in, whether that's design or publishing or manufacturing or finance or retail sales, so that you aren't just mindlessly doing what the ""domain experts"" tell you to do. Do work that demonstrably adds value to the business and be able to describe how it does so. Learn the fundamentals of accounting so that you know how people keep score when evaluating a company -- that will help you to articulately describe how your everyday activities lead to higher revenues or lower costs. Learn to write and speak so that you can better sell your stuff. Learn to teach and hire and manage and direct so that you can improve your leverage: Why settle for being a better programmer when you can command a small platoon of better programmers?<p>Or you could always take the (ahem) short cut: Found a company, make scads of money, cash out, and change your title to ""mogul"" or perhaps ""playboy"". ;)<p>Of course, doctors and lawyers and accountants and architects and graphic designers may do all of these things while retaining their job titles. But once a programmer starts doing these things she will probably be referred to by some other title [1], no matter what fraction of her day is composed of software work or how much her programming education informs her day-to-day decisions. That's my point.<p>---<p>[1] She will probably <i>want</i> another title. I've chatted with designers who are experts in Drupal and who are heavily invested in the notion that, until you actually <i>type an original PHP function definition into a text editor</i>, you are ""not a programmer"". They'll sit there, constructing the equivalent of enormous SQL queries with the GUI-based query builder, building mind-blowing spiderwebs of relational structure with the GUI-based model builder, copying and pasting and modifying PHP, typing in custom CSS and even writing <i>original jQuery code</i>, yet all the while maintaining that they are <i>not</i> programmers and that what they are doing is <i>not</i> programming. To suggest otherwise is to commit a serious <i>faux pas</i>. It's like accusing them of being <i>day laborers</i>.",1230579316

Right now I have everything stored on my network at home, but soon that will run out of space and the odds of it surviving 30 years is low (particularly given my own experience!).<p>A while ago I bought the domain iCapsule.com with the idea of creating a digital time capsule that you could periodically put digital content into (or stream it for that matter) and the subscriber would then buy an insurance policy that would fund the repository for a generation.  I originally was thinking it'd be sold to people who by the cryogenic storage so that they can have a backup of their life just in case.

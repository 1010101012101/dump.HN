4897054,comment,4892769,4892869,1,0,Alex3917,,,">he gives not a single example of a question that those disciplines have answered.<p>Relevant:<p>""recent advocates of scientism have taken the ironic but logical next step of denying any useful role for philosophy whatsoever, even the subservient philosophy of the positivist sort. But the last laugh, it seems, remains with the philosophers  for the advocates of scientism reveal conceptual confusions that are obvious upon philosophical reflection. Rather than rendering philosophy obsolete, scientism is setting the stage for its much-needed revival. [...] In contrast to reason, a defining characteristic of superstition is the stubborn insistence that something  a fetish, an amulet, a pack of Tarot cards  has powers which no evidence supports. From this perspective, scientism appears to have as much in common with superstition as it does with properly conducted scientific research. Scientism claims that science has already resolved questions that are inherently beyond its ability to answer.""",1355104752

Philosophy isn't about positing grand-sounding statements without proof. It's about backing up such statements with valid logic.<p>Something like: Hello, I analysed 12 different ways in which people use the word ""self"", and came up with precise definitions for each of them so that there is no room for ambiguity or vagueness. Here I demonstrate that each and every one of them has exactly the same logical structure as, and is therefore reducible to, the phrase ""the sense of self"", a precise definition of which follows: blah blah blah. Therefore, I posit that ""self"" === ""the sense of self"".<p>Neuroscientists can show <i>how</i> certain biochemical processes cause members of <i>homo sapiens</i> to confuse the self with the sense of self, but error theory is not a positive demonstration. So I maintain that a healthy dose of philosophy is still required.<p>Also, just because you can't draw a line between two things doesn't mean that there's no distinction between them. Is abortion the same as murder just because foetal development is a continuous process with no sharp boundaries?",1355104635

I'd personally rather live/work in Atlanta over Austin, but the culture of Atlanta, while improving, is nowhere near the likes of San Fran or NYC.<p>But there have been many successful start ups through out Atlanta's history, such as Coke, Turner Broadcasting System(CNN/Turner/etc), UPS, and more. All of these were revolutionary start ups at the time, and now are massive corporations. I expect future companies like this to be founded here in Atlanta, because it is essentially the capital of the South East, geographically about a quarter of the country.<p>What makes me want to move away from Atlanta is the poor city infrastructure, the dependence on suburbs, and the lack of culture.

One way to do that is to map each point of ""latitude""  and ""longitude""  (in degrees), to the point ((+90)/180, /360).<p>Now, let's consider the rectangle [0, .5] x [0, 1]. There is obviously a 1:1 mapping from this to the original square (just halve or double one of the coordinates to change from one to the other). In an intuitive sense, there are ""as many"" points in half the square as in the whole square, a bit like there are as many natural numbers as there are <i>even</i> numbers. (This is <i>one</i> definition of infinite set, if I remember correctly).<p>Now this means that we can remap all the points from half the square to a complete sphere, and the points from the other half square to a ""new"" complete sphere, in fact mapping points from the original sphere S to two new identical spheres.<p>Is this reasoning correct, or am I missing anything (probably something obvious...)?",1355103615

I know that the act of working on something is not a waste of time since you learn from the process of building but I can't ignore the feeling that I wasted my time anyway.<p>The way I do my projects now is that I try to get a core group of influential people in their niche to get excited about the project I'm building and I leave it to them to tell their friends about it. I've never spent a dime on marketing. A lot of traffic to one of my sites comes from FB, for example, and mainly from fan-created pages.<p>With the new project I'm currently working on, I noticed a group of users trying to shoehorn their activities into an existing platform that didn't exactly fit them. The first thing I did was to contact a lot of these people personally and asked them questions about what they were doing. After getting a fairly good idea, I then asked them if they were interested in testing something that I'll make for them in the next few weeks which got a positive response.<p>I spent a week building the core features that I thought were the most useful for them. All the core features worked but since I ported a lot of existing code from my old projects to speed things up, a lot of the other stuff was broken but that's okay. I hate building useless stuff so I needed to know right away if I was on the right track.<p>I invited the people I contacted to test it out. They didn't like it. Discouraging but expected. After a weekend of tweaks and discussions, they started getting more and more excited about the project as they started to see things progress. I made sure I involved them in all of the design discussions and tried to make them feel that this was their project as much as it is mine. Basically, tons of buy-in which also works wonders for my morale to keep going. They're excited, I'm excited, and now we're at the point where they've decided that they're going to bring all of their activities over to the new site.<p>It's a lot of upfront work to be sure, but this way, I can approach it more from a systems analysis standpoint now than a marketing exercise later.<p>TL;DR Find a key group of prospective users and involve them in your project from the beginning. Let them be a part of its creation, generate excitement, then let the marketing take care of itself from there.",1355103555

4896987,comment,4892769,4896299,1,0,super_mario,,,"We are still in early stages of developing scientific answers to these questions. But they are fundamentally scientific. Note also that like culinary tastes there may not be unique answers to these questions, but sure it does not mean that all diets are equally good for your health.<p>Human well-being entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain. Consequently, there must be scientific truths to be known about it. A more detailed understanding of these truths will force us to draw clear distinctions between different ways of living in society with one another, judging some to be better or worse, more or less true to the facts, and more or less ethical. Clearly, such insights could help us to improve the quality of human life.<p>We may not be able to resolve every moral controversy through science. Differences of opinion will remain. But opinions will be increasingly constrained by facts. And it is important to realize that our inability to answer a question says nothing about whether the question itself has an answer. Exactly how many people were bitten by mosquitoes in the last sixty seconds? How many of these people will contract malaria? How many will die as a result? Given the technical challenges involved, no team of scientists could possibly respond to such questions. And yet we know that they admit of simple numerical answers. Does our inability to gather the relevant data oblige us to respect all opinions equally? Of course not. In the same way, the fact that we may not be able to resolve specific moral dilemmas does not suggest that all competing responses to them are equally valid. Mistaking no answers in practice for no answers in principle is a great source of confusion.<p>People who want to argue moral questions are not scientific are in effect saying reason is powerless to answer the most important questions in human life. And how a person perceives the gulf between facts and values seems to influence their views on almost every issue of social importance from the fighting of wars to the education of children.<p>This rupture in our thinking has different consequences at each end of the spectrum: religious conservatives tend to believe that there are right answers to questions of meaning and morality, but only because the God of Abraham deems it so. They concede that ordinary facts can be discovered through rational inquiry, but they believe that values must come from a voice in a whirlwind. Scriptural literalism, intolerance of diversity, mistrust of science, disregard for the real causes of human and animal suffering, this is how the division between facts and values expresses itself on the religious right.<p>From the point of view of popular culture, science often seems like little more than a hatchery for technology. While most educated people will concede that the scientific method has delivered centuries of fresh embarrassment to religion on matters of fact, it is now an article of almost unquestioned certainty, both inside and outside scientific circles, that science has nothing to say about what constitutes a good life. Religious thinkers in all faiths, and on both ends of the political spectrum, are united on precisely this point; the defense one most often hears for belief in God is not that there is compelling evidence for his existence, but that faith in him is the only reliable source of meaning and moral guidance. Mutually incompatible religious traditions now take refuge behind the same non sequitur.<p>It seems inevitable, however, that science will gradually encompass lifes deepest questionsand this is guaranteed to provoke a backlash. How we respond to the resulting collision of worldviews will influence the progress of science, of course, but it may also determine whether we succeed in building a global civilization based on shared values. The question of how human beings should live in the twenty-first century has many competing answersand most of them are surely wrong. Only a rational understanding of human well-being will allow billions of us to coexist peacefully, converging on the same social, political, economic, and environmental goals. A science of human flourishing may seem a long way off, but to achieve it, we must first acknowledge that the intellectual terrain actually exists.",1355103469
4896986,story,,,2,1,jacobwg,"Ask HN: What is your personal use-case for social networking?",,"I have been recently thinking about how I use social apps and tools.  My electronic social experience consists of bits and pieces of Facebook, Pinterest, Gchat, iMessage, and email.  My primary use case is to keep in touch with people with whom I am close, not necessarily broadcast things to a wide group of acquaintances.  I have customized the Facebook newsfeed settings with custom lists, update types, and notifications so that I can view content that is of particular interest to me based on the particular people sharing it.  Pinterest is mainly used for their more recent ""secret"" board feature for communicating with a small set of close friends in a more visual format. Facebook, Gchat, and iMessage are used for IM-style communication depending on the other person and their preferred platform.  And Facebook has largely replaced email for lots of my friends.<p>This got me thinking - how are others using Facebook and similar social tools?  How are others using these existing tools to solve their unique problems?

At the same time, feeling as if you have the power to affect everything is not healthy. Some things are just outside of your control.",1355102247
4896936,comment,4896134,4896502,2,0,babarock,,,"I don't like the way `find` is being criticized, both in the article and in your comment. I won't go into pointless bickering on why it's a wonderful tool and ""my stuff is better than yours"". Let's keep using the tool we're each comfortable with. But do I really need to point out that, once you go through the initial learning curve, `find` is probably (one of the, if not) the most powerful tool in the Unix toolbox? If Unix's shell power comes from piping commands for streams to flow through, I find that in the vast majority of the cases `find` is the best way to initiate this stream.<p>And the reason is that it's reliable (unlike `ls`) and isn't wasteful (unlike the most-misused-tool-of-all `cat`). I don't understand why similarly newbie-unfriendly tools (like `sed` or `awk` for instance) never get as much heat as `find` does from people unfamiliar with it. Is it because the name implies that it should be a simple tool?<p>As for what's wrong with the `ls ... | grep -v ...`. It can break in so many ways like for instance, if a filename contains a newline character. If you think that never happens, you're making the same mistake me and a thousand of newcomers before me made once and never repeated again.<p>As a rule of thumb, <i>never parse the output of ls</i> (<a href=""http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs</a>).",1355102236

Hopefully something like this will entice and motivate certain developers to start developing for PC/X86-X64 again.<p>And now that Valve will release an actual console, Steam will be able to cover a much larger population than any of the consoles. People satisfied with performance on the par with Xbox and PS3 will  be perfectly happy with this solution, while people requiring more performance will be free to build a dedicated gaming machine and install Steam on it.<p>I don't know how no other console manufacturers have thought of this.

188964,comment,188723,188902,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Good point on Mary Gates, though my material point was that only Bill Gates was going to get the contract.  Any one else would have faced significant challenges.  Also, given the fact that Bill was in his early twenties at the time, I suspect, and I think you do too, that those conversations were anything but casual.<p>Additionally, IBM has been a services company for over a hundred years.  With the greatest service rendered at the Nuremberg trials in my opinion.  Hardware has been a way for them to sell services for quite some time. That said, a review of their historical financials, will bear out the fact that they have made far more money on service and support than hardware.  That is true if you zoom in per year as well by the way.  The computer industry emerged around the 1950s, and IBM was the guy selling the most of them, it's true.  But, take a look into their training, service and support contracts if you want to see some serious revenue growth charts.<p>As to your last point, it is the same point made by Microsoft fanboys in the 80s.  It is, in a way, the original 'long tail' argument.  It has merit, in that companies that can monopolize the long tail, as Microsoft has done, will make a lot of money.  But the fact remains that even with its 'long tail' monopolization, Microsoft still generates less revenue than IBM.  FAR less.  Why?  Because the smaller companies are not willing to pay as much as larger organizations.  Which is why they choose Microsoft, it is cheaper, and it is good enough.<p>Now your assertion is that they will choose Google in the future, because it will be cheaper still, and good enough.<p>Consider, however, what happens as these customers get more and more frugal. Suppose everyone on the long tail thinks that your product should not cost as much as Microsoft's.  Or let's suppose that they believe that everything you get over the internet should be ... say ... free.  The amount of money that the monopolizer can generate goes down.  But IBM's service and support contracts stay the same price for the big guys!  That's the beauty of being IBM.  You always win in the end.",1210708497

188959,comment,188489,188632,0,0,TunaFish,,,"I find it funny, if also a bit sad, how strongly certain societal groups try to spin Einstein's views about religion decades after his death. For insight, I offer a bit more of his text around that tiny little quote that is so often used out of context.<p>""<i>The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.<p>Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist, I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point, with reference to the actual content of historical religions. This qualification has to do with the concept of God. During the youthful period of mankind's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man's own image, who, by the operations of their will were supposed to determine, or at any rate to influence, the phenomenal world. Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favor by means of magic and prayer. The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods. Its anthropomorphic character is shown, for instance, by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes.</i>"" (whole text is available at <a href=""http://einsteinandreligion.com/scienceandreligion2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://einsteinandreligion.com/scienceandreligion2.html</a> , and I strongly recommend it.)<p>This brings us back to the issue of lies. That quote is so often used to state that Einstein was religious later in life, while less than 2 paragraphs away, he completely eviscerates the idea of personal god. Obviously, someone here has told a lie of omission. Was it you, or the one who first told you about the quote? Does this, in any way, lessen your trust in the truthfulness of that source? Will you now be going around correcting other religious people when they use that quote to assert that Einstein believed in a god later in his life?",1210708252

188951,comment,188489,188552,0,0,mhartl,,,"Let <i>N</i> be the number of great scientists.  It would be sensible for the curriculum to include the <i>n</i> greatest scientists, where <i>n</i> << <i>N</i>.  Since Marie Curie <i>always</i> gets included in the textbooks, we can conclude either that she ranks as one of the <i>n</i> greatest scientists, even for <i>very</i> small <i>n</i>, or that the reasons for her inclusion go beyond her scientific accomplishments.  Considering how few history textbooks mention (for example) Euler, Gauss, Lagrange, Laplace, Lavoisier, Faraday, Dirac, Onsager, or Landau---whose scientific accomplishments all rival or surpass Curie's---it's safe to conclude (as Paul did) that the textbook writers include some non-scientific factors when deciding which scientists to include.<p>Let's face it: almost no one reading this knows who the hell Onsager and Landau are---but you probably should.  (They were both giants of 20th-century physics.)  No one disputes that Marie Curie was a great scientist, but that's not enough to account for her ubiquity in the textbooks.  And since the most significant diff between Curie and Landau is gender, it's accurate to say that Curie gets included because she was female.",1210707385

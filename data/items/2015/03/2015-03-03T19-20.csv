I thought we’d left that level of misunderstanding behind us a few years ago.<p>There is no such thing as a RESTful URL. Characters in URLs don’t matter.<p>GET and POST have different semantics. Ignoring the benefits of caching is just dumb.<p>The semantics of status codes and verbs are defined pretty clearly.

It exposed me to other high-schoolers like me. It made me friends I still have today. It still stands as one of my most formative experiences.<p>The difference being that even if you had missed out on this one, you would have most likely had quite a few more as a white guy.<p>> Now, each spot once of those poor students occupied was a spot which could have been occupied by an excellent student.<p>Excellent student? Someone could be an excellent student that&#x27;s never done simple addition before and look horrible in an algebra class because of that fundamental education not being there.<p>> The poor students weren&#x27;t poor students because they were female, or because they were non-white, but because they were unintelligent and/or uneducated.<p>I find it interesting that you put unintelligent before uneducated, you might want to self-examine and see if you hold some prejudices. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s almost always lack of education and/or lack of opportunity creating the environment you&#x27;ve described.<p>> Each of those spots represented a young life which wasn&#x27;t changed like mine was. Which of those students, unaccepted because of their gender or colour, dropped out of high school, never applied to college, committed suicide or majored in some non-technical field? How dare anyone think that&#x27;s right?<p>You&#x27;re right.

Look, every AGI researcher I have ever read was well aware of this, and it&#x27;s their primary concern.  It&#x27;s the central question really.  Not so much what n and k to set, but how to get such an entity to do anything at all.  Why do biological entities do anything?  They have motives.  Why do they have motives?  Because they have biological constraints, and a hardwired self preservation drive.  How to get that in a machine made by us rather than a billion years of natural process, that&#x27;s the hard question.  How to make a machine with the equivalent of motives and emotions.  Both sides of the problem are well recognized.<p>In an ideal world I would prefer this research (AGI, and there is a quantum leap to be made between self driving cars and AGI) to stay strictly under the auspices of “pure science”, i.e. academia.  No government, no private interests.  But that&#x27;s not going to happen.  The next best thing, I think, would be to not let those in power monopolize the research.",1425412667

9140228,comment,9138134,9138724,0,0,gnaffle,,,"> I call that filter bubble. I like using git for local commits, but 15 out of 20 persons here don&#x27;t even take their laptop with them and I bet that 17 out of 20 won&#x27;t touch code on the road. Maybe at home, if they have to. A decent centralized VCS would totally do.<p>It&#x27;s not only &quot;for local commits&quot;, although being able to have local branches without polluting a public namespace is a huge win. It&#x27;s also about _speed_ when you&#x27;re doing VCS operations. Linus Torvalds actually made the case really well in his talk: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</a><p>> There are a lot of companies that actually would prefer if the code never left the premises and have a use-case for finer grained permissions (some folks can only touch the assets, others can only ever see the dev branch, can&#x27;t see history,...), things that are by definition not possible in a DVCS.<p>That&#x27;s a question that&#x27;s completely orthogonal to whether or not you use a DVCS. How is a &quot;traditional&quot; VCS going to help you when you can check out the code locally and smuggle it out on a flash drive?<p>In my company, we use git and there are access restrictions as to who can access and commit to our branches.<p>> Storing large assets in git sort of suck and requires ulgy hacks. I&#x27;d love to version the toolchain and the VM images for the local development environment, but that&#x27;s just not feasible with git.<p>..and that&#x27;s not the use case for git. Linus has been very clear about _what_ git is optimized for, performance wise.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that DVCSes in general are useless for storing large assets, but that the most popular implementation is. Also, I&#x27;m not really sure what traditional VCS you&#x27;re referring to, that makes it easy to version VM images and remain storage efficient?",1425412522

I&#x27;m really just trying to divine the source of your cynicism.  Possibilities include:<p>1. There are too many games; it&#x27;s as hard to get noticed in this sector as it is on the app store.<p>2. You don&#x27;t stand a chance if you can&#x27;t make a polished game, and a polished game is going to have a $100,000 budget (or let&#x27;s just say, way more than &quot;I think I&#x27;ll download the free version of Unity&quot; can afford).<p>3. Most games are mediocre at best, and yours probably will be too (because the designers of those hits really knew what they were doing, and you probably don&#x27;t).<p>Am I getting this right?  All of the above?  Some of the above?<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of indie games that I think are mediocre become hits.  I&#x27;ve rarely seen a game that I think is a gem go completely unnoticed.  Part of it, it seems to me, is that a really tight niche game can become a hit within that niche and make a surprising amount of money doing it.<p>Take &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; by Shenandoah (which <i>is</i> an iOS game).  $20,000 ask on Kickstarter for a game that is going after people who are into <i>hex wargames.</i>  I&#x27;m going to guess that that game did considerably better than $3000 a quarter.

Wrong. You can&#x27;t generate a diff, unless you first made copy of the original sources, or re-download/unpack it. So there&#x27;s an essential step missing.<p>And often enough, you simply don&#x27;t have access to the svn repo to do step 1.<p><pre><code>    1. Fork the repository on GitHub
    2. Clone your fork of the source code
    3. Make sure you’re on the right branch that upstream expects your patch to be based on, because they totally won’t take patches on master if they expect them on dev or vice-versa.
    4. Make a new local branch for your patch
    5. Go ahead and make the patch
    6. Do a commit
    7. Push to a new branch on your GitHub fork
    8. Go to the GitHub UI and create a pull request
    9. Watch it get ignored
</code></pre>
1. is github specific. Gitlab and Bitbucket don&#x27;t require that<p>3. applies to SVN projects too.<p>4. is optional (though highly recommended)<p>But it gets really interesting when you want to do a second, separate patch.

As a result, &quot;AI isn&#x27;t going to happen&quot; really is not a good argument against discussing the potential risks of it. (... and I say that as someone who <i>is</i> an &quot;AI is around the corner&quot; skeptic.)<p>Yet that doesn&#x27;t change the basic risk calculus. In his previous post, Sam advocated imposing draconian licensing and observation requirements on what <i>in practice</i> would be the majority of non-trivial CS research. He advocated this on the basis of the <i>potential</i> risk that as-yet-to-be-developed hypothetical AIs might pose to human beings.<p>I did a short post on it here: <a href=""http://adamierymenko.com/did-sam-altman-of-y-combinator-just-start-a-campaign-to-license-and-regulate-all-cs-research/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adamierymenko.com/did-sam-altman-of-y-combinator-just...</a><p>In addition to what I wrote there, I think that the risk of dramatically slowing progress in CS/AI also has to be taken into account. There is risk of doing and there is the risk of not doing.<p>The problem is that we currently face a number of existential risks -- like catastrophic economic collapse due to fossil fuel depletion -- where the majority of the risk is in the &quot;risk of not doing&quot; category. We know with total certainty that if we continue business as usual with no change, our civilization <i>will</i> collapse. It&#x27;s simple physics and high school math -- exponential growth in consumption of a finite resource without any substitution or path to replacement can only end in one way.<p>Smart computers might help us crack tough problems like fusion, safe and scalable fission, better batteries to make renewable energy more practical, etc. That in turn might help us avoid an absolutely real, tangible, non-hypothetical, definite existential risk. I see no reason to hamstring that kind of progress to defend against extremely hypothetical low-probability risks.<p>That&#x27;s why I consider Sam&#x27;s suggestions to regulate CS research more dangerous than any risk posed by speculative AI scenarios.<p>I am not opposed to all regulation, but I am opposed to regulations based on extremely hypothetical hand-wavey risks. I&#x27;m also opposed to regulations that are virtually impossible to define accurately or enforce fairly. Regulations should be clear, objective, rationally justified by <i>tangible</i> problems or risks, and <i>minimal</i>. We should have regulations around, say, the use of nuclear materials, but that&#x27;s because we know for an absolute fact that it is dangerous. We should have financial regulations because we know financial fraud has happened and will continue to happen without them. ... etc. But I positively cringe at the imposition of ill-defined broad regulations based on fear-mongering and &quot;precautionary principle&quot; thinking -- a.k.a. institutionalized paranoia and cowardice. Such regulations can do nothing other than halt progress in the name of vague paranoia.<p>Make no mistake: Sam&#x27;s proposal in his previous post would halt all non-trivial CS research, or at least would slow it to such a crawl that it would effectively stop. It would also cause a mass exodus from the field, since nobody wants to operate under that kind of nonsense. Given that CS is the primary driver now of progress in other fields, that would also likely halt major progress in energy, materials, propulsion, transportation, etc.<p>If you read my blog post above, I take this in almost a conspiracy direction and speculate that this is some sort of political power play to lock down the field. The reason for this is that I find it hard to believe that someone of Sam&#x27;s intellect and education would <i>not</i> realize the implications of what he&#x27;s suggesting.",1425411679

The technician in me prefers UE4, but the businessman in me made me choose Unity.  Here&#x27;s why.<p>I absolutely must deploy to Android and iOS. Last time I built the Tappy Chicken sample in Unreal, it was like 900 megabytes and made my phone hot enough to melt, and only ran on very high end Android devices.<p>I thought that after a year or so, Unreal Engine would get more serious about mobile. Maybe their idea of mobile is just different from mine. I&#x27;m not trying to deploy a pocket version of Battlefield 4 onto a phone. I&#x27;m trying to do fun little games that make money, and I want to deploy them This Year.<p>Unreal Engine just doesn&#x27;t seem like a safe bet for my requirements. Which is too bad, because I love it so much. I wish I could use it for my products. I keep posting that little rant above every few months on the Unreal Engine forums, hoping that someone will explain to me how mistaken I am, and how UE is really getting their act together on mobile, and I keep getting disappointed.<p>I am delighted with Unity&#x27;s announcement.  And I&#x27;ve upgraded my main project to Unity 5, and it looks much more beautiful, and I&#x27;m excited.

I shouldn&#x27;t even need to explain the requirement for these, but a few examples are included in the next bullet point<p>> anything that uses $EDITOR (eg visudo and crontab -e). While you can edit these files without vim (et al) and still use these tools to check your edits before committing them, it is considerably more work for something that&#x27;s otherwise really very easy<p>There is no reason why $EDITOR couldn&#x27;t be set as a full-blown graphical text editor. If we are talking about remote systems, I do wish there was some convenient way to pass open file descriptors (or something of similar effect) over ssh. This also would kinda mesh with what I said about pagers.<p>Kinda related is the emacs-daemon stuff. I haven&#x27;t experimented with it enough, but I think you should be able to tunnel it over ssh to enable transparent editing of remote files, which is cool and the direction we should be going.<p>> some monitoring tools (top et al). Though I will grant you that there are other (sometimes better) ways to probe this information. But let&#x27;s not begrudge a sysadmins prerogative to be lazy ;)<p>One kinda cool solution for these kind of applications could be small web applications that are designed to be run on-demand and tunneled over ssh (or accessed locally) instead of the more traditional persistent applications sitting behind proper web server etc. It would help if we had some simple scaffolding to support this mode of operation, e.g. a flag to ssh that set up the tunneling etc, launched the application, and then launched browser automatically without needing to fiddle with port numbers and whatnot manually. If we really wanted to push something like this then we could even develop something like HTTP over stdio.<p>> REPLs, (eg RDBMS SQL command lines (mysql, pgsql, etc), Python, etc). You could probably argue against the &quot;need&quot; for many imperative / functional REPLs, but database command lines are extremely useful.<p>Funny to mention REPLs in a thread about web-based (kinda) REPL. Beside that REPLs generally are mostly line-based to begin with, with the exception of readline. And for readline, that functionality could again be pushed to client/terminal (&quot;local line editing&quot;). Of course getting all the functionality of readline to work locally would be an interesting challenge.<p>> some interactive package managers (eg aptitude, yaourt) which are useful if you have bespoke queries (eg you don&#x27;t know the name of a package you wish to install so you need to combine repository searches with install requests).<p>Same solution as for the monitoring applies. But I might add that various forms of (remote) GUIs imho could use more work. Where is the GUI equivalent of ncurses, both in simplicity and lightweightness? And just to clarify GUI does not imply some silly mouse driven skeuomorphic WIMP, another thing that seems ignored too often.<p>> It&#x27;s also worth noting that even apt-get will occasionally jump into an interactive mode (eg using ncurses for requesting mysql passwords or prompted installs when doing distribution upgrades.<p>There is more than their (unnecessary) use of ncurses to dislike here.<p>> This is by no means a conclusive list, and certainly more detailed than I think your comment perhaps deserves.<p>I hope this comment, even with bit stream-of-consciousness tendencies, is more satisfactory to you.

And if you aren&#x27;t thinking about the experience of real or theoretical third-party developers when building your API, why even have one at all?<p>They don&#x27;t care what the internal function names are but they do care about the language of the domain, and if the internal program is well written then those will be one and the same. The HTTP verb model is inadequate for domains of realistic complexity; imagine a developer looking for the method that flubbleizes the worzwort. Is this POST /worzworts/12345 ?  PATCH /worzworts/12345 ? If you squint at it then flubbleizing is kind of like adding another bishwiggle, so maybe it&#x27;s PUT /worzworts/12345/bishwiggles ? Most people tend to realize that these domain-specific operations don&#x27;t have a HTTP representation and instead make them a POST with the specific operation in the URL. But then you end up with an api that looks like:<p><pre><code>    #flubbleize a worzwort
    POST /worzworts/12345/flubbleize
    #mrefgle a worzwort
    POST /worzworts/12345/mrefgle
    #chezzle a worzwort
    POST /worzworts/12345/chezzle
    #delete a worzwort
    DELETE /worzworts/12345
</code></pre>
This ends up being <i>less</i> consistent, and <i>more</i> confusing to a developer, than simply using POST for every operation.<p>> If you ignore HTTP verbs and status codes you&#x27;re just making it harder for other developers to grok your system. It&#x27;s less about adherence to some strict standard and more about helpful signaling. A GET fetches data, POST creates new records, PUT is idempotent, DELETE deletes. 4xx status codes indicate a request error, 5xx indicate a server error. That&#x27;s all useful information for someone trying to integrate with your API, but you think that instead everyone should memorize your in-house conventions. Good luck getting buy-in on that.<p>The developer doesn&#x27;t start by knowing that something is a PUT and trying to figure out what it&#x27;s doing - they start by knowing what they want to do and trying to figure out the call. The world isn&#x27;t consistent enough for them to be able to guess, and splitting the call into two parts - verb and path - makes it harder to remember once you&#x27;ve looked it up, not easier.<p>4xx vs 5xx is maybe valuable, but the very fact that you xx it suggests that the difference between 412 and 422 probably isn&#x27;t important. In practice every REST API I&#x27;ve seen has felt the need to include a response body that a) explains the error and b) <i>includes their own API-specific error code</i>. In which case, why repeat yourself badly in the HTTP status code?",1425410664

   showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a

   somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of

That&#x27;s one of the reasons I&#x27;ve always loved Hypercard. [1] It made ordinary computer users programmers -- heck, it was even used to create the hit game Myst.

In the nineteen eighties no less!<p>As computers have become more consumer oriented, the ordinary user doesn&#x27;t _need_ to know how to program. There are plenty of apps for individual purposes. But I often wonder how different things would be if our operating system were more like Hypercard. Need a calculator app? Build one. Okay, perhaps a waste of time you&#x27;d say. But let&#x27;s say the ordinary user could build a calculator app -- those skills could be extended to piece together ever more sophisticated tools.<p>A lot of people argue that ordinary folks don&#x27;t want to program.

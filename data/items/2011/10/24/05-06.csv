Even when the topic of discussion might not be one he wants to have on his site.<p>Several recent-ish negative stories (Dropbox security, Air BnB apartment damage) about YC companies <i>really</i> demonstrated pg's commitment to an open forum and really helped earn a <i>ton</i> of respect for pg and his commitment to this community.

3148433,comment,3148166,3148166,3,0,lemmsjid,,,"People get such different experiences at institutions of higher learning.  I completed my BA at a small, teaching-focused college, and don't regret a minute of it.  I felt like it was an excellent preparation for my subsequent career, even though I was in a completely different field than I majored in.  I had passionate professors with high standards, who continually challenged me to up the ante.  I came into college thinking I was pretty smart, and, like intellectual boot camp, they stripped away those egotistical veneers of self-congratulatory-smartdom and made me realize how impossibly huge the world is, and how many perspectives there can be, and how I exist in the world not as a calcified foundation of knowledge and opinions, but as an agent who navigates the world by learning, listening, and observing.<p>One moment that stands out is when I turned in what I felt was a nicely articulate paper, one that would have been an easy A, and it came back with a D and a ""see me in my office.""  The professor dressed me down and had me write it again.  Why?  Because I was critiquing the subject material rather than respecting it.<p>I plunged right into start-up world after graduating, and it felt very familiar, in the sense that in a startup you're constantly confronting uncertainty and unknowing to the point where you have to become comfortable with those feelings.  Once again, you become an agent of learning rather than an agent of knowing.<p>I hear about people from larger schools complaining about huge classes taught by processors with no interest in teaching, where they have no conversation happening, and no direct feedback--and I think I would be sufficiently frustrated in such a situation that I would have been more inclined to drop out if the opportunity were there.  I even hear from people who went to my school who hated every minute of it--you just can't tell.<p>I also don't think college is a foundational requirement for success--I know plenty of people in the tech world who didn't complete their BA and who are doing just fine--I honestly can say it doesn't have much bearing to see someone's educational credentials on a resume unless I also can see their body of work.<p>It all comes down to what your own experience is.  Which is why I'm throwing in my two-cents...I'd hate for someone who IS having a good experience think that they need to drop out because Steve Jobs did.",1319435153

That's their own choice. It does mean that people that do understand that area (even a bit) can sell them bullshit. Then again, we are only human. Everyone has some areas where they (knowingly or unknowingly) are at the top of the abstraction scale. There are just too many details the world is built on.<p>On the other hand I am scared of companies trying to close down all ways to find out how something works. Either through laws, or technical means such as DRM.<p>When it's no longer possible to dive into the details when you want, knowledge becomes something restricted to elites. Companies would love their customers to handle their technology like magic. To be able to sell them what they want without ever being called bullshit, and being able to sell new devices instead of customers repairing them.<p>That's why I love open source.

There is a growing trend in the classroom to allow students to move on even when they have no foundational skills. As long as they get a D they get credit and can move on regardless of their lack of a solid foundation from which to accurately build upon.<p>A large part of the issue is that the classrooms aren't differentiated by ability so we have students who can't really do or understand basic math but we're trying to teach them algebra and trigonometry. Some of them may pull through but do they really understand the subject matter when they don't understand the foundation from which it builds upon?<p>One of my education instructors told me once that it doesn't matter if a student can calculate 20x15 as long as they understand that we're looking for a number that is 20 times larger than 15. The problem is they really don't understand and they must rely on a calculator for even basic math. It really is disappointing and I'm not sure I want to teach anymore.<p>I feel like the system is broken and just because someone, somewhere said that when we educate students like this they can perform just as well or better than if we actually made sure they were in a class that suits their abilities we've latched onto it as a method of reform.<p>(I taught developmental math for 2 years at a local community college.

190288,comment,190215,190215,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"As previous news articles state, Facebook has some implementation of XMPP going on. XMPP was designed from the ground-up to deal with <i>exactly</i> the issues that he highlights, and is the ideal real-time implementation for any system where everyone is expected to be aware of the statuses of all others on the network (verses the traditional ""poll the server every x seconds"" methods).<p>Even if Facebook isn't using XMPP per-say, they have full access to its implementations and source code for internal use for sure.<p>Granted, Facebook _does_ have the ""slight"" challenge of having 70 million active users; in light of which near everyone else's IM/XMPP networks are a mere pittance; but the core framework and algorithms are wholly addressed and implemented in XMPP standard.<p>It's one thing to make a more-efficient implementation of an already-existing standard that scales damn decently verses _designing_ a whole new system to serve their needs.<p>Note that the article doesn't once mention XMPP though.",1210831038

190277,comment,190215,190215,0,0,tdavis,,,"I correctly guessed at the use of Erlang for the web servers; persistent connections and pushing is a must and Apache is hardly designed for so many persistent processes. Thrift was also a pretty easy call considering it's a FB project; I still want to check that out, too.<p>The information wasn't incredibly in-depth but it's very cool and useful nonetheless to read about implementations like this on such a large scale. The chances of me ever creating something with the scale and resources that FB requires is pretty slim, but it's gratifying to know I've at least got a rough idea of some good ways to do it.<p>Now, if we could just get Twitter to do the same, perhaps someone could give them a few pointers... ;)<p><i>""Did I miss it, or does the note not mention how they actually implemented the notification?""</i><p>No, it doesn't go over that implementation, though it piqued my curiosity nonetheless. I would assume it's a time-based check on status rather than a real-time representation.",1210828901

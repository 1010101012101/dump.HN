However, ignorance of all patents causes Fear Uncertainty and Doubt at the slightest mention of the an overly broad patent title.  Knowledge of the patents in your field is the only way to avoid infringing them.  I used to believe that ignorance was the better path, but that only leads to you being sued over something you were unaware of.  Now I opt to avoid being sued in the first place.",1267211082

In the unlikely case I end up working a day-job for the rest of my life, I'll do everything in my power to ensure you get the discount, even if I have to pay the difference myself.<p>I'm going to look over my post and see how I can improve the message.

If you pass JavaScript into mongodb theoretically you could open an injection problem if you don't use parametrization.

Nothing really special about nosql itself that prevents this.",1267211004

That's pretty weak.<p>Interesting experiment. The danger is you get a handful of takers, then you have to live forever with the admin overhead of keeping track of them (as they change email addresses, etc. over the years), all for a little temporary pocket money. I guess that's why you need to say things like ""I'll do my best."" Maybe you could add a condition, saying the deal will kick in once X number of people sign up, otherwise everyone gets refunded.",1267210947

However, he became a lot more placid after getting married.<p>A fellow student was very driven, he was on track to becoming a SEAL at one point (changed his mind due to the psychological effects of being a SEAL).  However, he too became much more laid back after getting married.  He told me that he noticed married people lose their drive.<p>On the other hand, I had a classics professor who is married with 4 kids, and he is very prolific.<p>Besides the biological aspects of getting married, I think marriage makes life more emotionally comfortable for people.    So, if a person's drive doesn't come from a lack of emotional stability, then they'll remain productive even after becoming married.",1202384452
110867,comment,110625,110625,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Cool, you deserve many up votes for this!<p>I just played around with it quickly, pasted in the recursive definition of factorial:<p>(def fact (x) (if (< x 1) 1 (* x (fact (- x 1)))))<p>It was fairly quick, but the results came back as floating point numbers. It broke on (fact 100).<p>Under arc-over-scheme it did better.<p>CLISP performed better than both, but the default limit in the call depth was easily exceeded (E.g. it busted on (fact 8000)). I don't recall exactly, but for around fact 5000 CLISP seemed about twice as fast as arc-over-scheme.<p>These are very rough estimates, but perhaps give people an intuition about performance.<p>Now what I am really waiting for is the arc-over-CLISP. I am too busy with other things to dare an attempt...",1202384389

They certainly have a lot more resources to throw at it than I do, but on the other hand:<p>- Hecl is real, and runs on all kinds of existing mobile phones, even old ones, and is deployed in existing products.<p>- Hecl is not tied to Sun, so for instance the Android port has no political implications.  I'm doing it because Android looks like a decent bet.<p>The fact that they made a scripting language at all is proof that my basic idea (scripting language for mobile phones) is on the right track.  Incidentally, YC also funded a company that made something similar: <a href=""http://tsumobi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tsumobi.com/</a>",1202382287

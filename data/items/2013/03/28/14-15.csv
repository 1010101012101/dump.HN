5455165,comment,5454775,5455108,4,0,kainsavage,,,"It is probably worth noting that while we strive to make the tests as fair as possible, we followed the official tutorials for each framework when building out the tests but we fully expect there to be small instances where minor tweaks improve a given test. Given that I am no Play expert, it would be of great value to have one who is (and it sounds like you could lend a hand there) to check out the code on the github page. If we did anything wrong with the setup or in general, we would rerun the tests. Again, we followed all the official 'getting started' posts for each framework, so we believe we have best practices used.<p>Disclaimer: I am a colleague of the author of the linked article.",1364482794

When we had something we felt could actually work, we immediately put it up on<p><a href=""https://github.com/dherman/asm.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dherman/asm.js</a><p>And worked on it there. asm.js has been discussed on IRC (#emscripten and other places), the emscripten mailing list, etc., as we further improved the spec.<p>About the middle last month, we got some performance numbers, and felt we could say something about speed, so I mentioned asm.js in my talk at mloc.js and other more noticeable places, but it was definitely not a secret far before that.<p>> relies extensively on engine quirks<p>That would be a bad bug in the asm.js spec.

It's funny how, when a tech/thing is ""hot"", you just don't really look ahead 5-10 years and think about it being anything less than ""hot"" then too (or at least that's my tendency). Looking at your question today in a new light, I can see how many factors would cause this:<p>1) More time = more competition.

That's not monoculture, rather: termination without too much redundancy in something not so complex that multiple browsers can hope to implement interoperably. The platform has to stand on certain primitives.<p>Remember XHTML2 vs. HTML5 back in 2005? It was going to be one or the other, even if browsers such as Firefox parsed both (but XHTML2 slowly and without incremental layout).<p>Maybe a Microsoft or Google could have ""done both"" well (but IE didn't, except by treating text/xhtml as error-corrected HTML!).<p>Without a single dominant browser vendor with enough cash and willpower to pull off more than the minimum set of semantically sufficient/complementary primitive languages, we were likely stuck with HTML/CSS/JS. SVG and MathML as HTML5 polyglot languages eventually were rationalized into the stack but still see too little use to be optimized well (and didn't Chrome turn off MathML recently?).<p>So the primitives have to be minimized against competing browsers' ability to implement them all interoperably. Browsers weren't going to do equally well at both the 2005-era XML languages (XHTML/SVG/XSLT) and the competing incremental plan (HTML5).<p>Arbitrary native code has been falling out as a part of the primitive layer for a while. Plugins such as Flash and Silverlight are in decline. You could say we had a plugin polyculture, but it was a security nightmare and also bad for users just in terms of updates and cross-browser/plugin UX consistency.<p>Pepper is an attempt to mediate plugins' access to OS and browser APIs, but too tied to chromium and too large for Google to standardize or for other vendors to swallow.<p>Consider also how Dart support (2nd VM, in particular GC barriers required for cross-VM-heap cycle collection) bounced off WebKit:<p><a href=""https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018811.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/...</a><p>I'm mostly being descriptive so far, but let me prescribe:<p>Based on the hard multi-vendor specification and software engineering problems of doing well with a roughly minimized set of primitives that we have today, I do not believe it's ""better"" for anyone, especially for web developers, to over-extend the primitive set with things like NaCl and Pepper.<p>That applies even if one vendor could, e.g., add SIMD primitives quickly. That just fragments the picture for developers, and misdirects some energy that could be spent on adding SIMD to JS.<p>Same goes for Dart. It was so important to do as a ""replacement"" (see leaked Dash memo) and not wait for the standards bodies, but that started in 2010 (or earlier? I knew only for certain in spring 2010). It's 2013 now and Dart is not going cross browser.

The example used in that talk was how to solve a semi-structured JSON file (where items in an array were of differing structure), but even then working with JSON remains pretty easy and the built-in marshalling can even be over-ridden if you have such a need (for example to map a complex type into a simple JSON representation).<p>Anyhow, your scenario... a few snippets to help you see it, if you need a working example you can run locally just ask and I'll knock one up.<p>This is a struct:<p><pre><code>    type MyRecord struct {\n        Id int64 `json:""id""`,\n        Title string `json:""title,omitempty""`,\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd it might match a database table like this:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE my_records (\n        record_id bigint NOT NULL,\n        title character varying(150)\n    )\n</code></pre>\nThat struct has some tags after the field declarations that describe to the JSON processor how to marshal an instance of MyRecord into some JSON.<p>If that table were Postgres you would probably use the driver located here: <a href=""https://github.com/lib/pq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lib/pq</a><p>You could connect to the database and populate your record from the database thus:<p><pre><code>    db, err := sql.Open(""postgres"", myConnectionString)\n    // do something if err != nil\n    defer db.Close()\n\n    stmt, err := db.Prepare(`SELECT record_id, title FROM my_records LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0`)\n    // do something if err != nil\n    defer stmt.Close()\n    \n    row := stmt.QueryRow()\n    \n    record := new(MyRecord)\n    err = row.Scan(&record.Id, &record.Title)\n    // do something if err != nil\n</code></pre>\nNow that your record is populated from the database, you can marshal it to JSON:<p><pre><code>    output, err = json.Marshal(record)\n    // do something if err != nil\n</code></pre>\nIf your row in the database looked like:<p><pre><code>    INSERT INTO my_records (record_id, title) VALUES (1,""Hello World"")\n</code></pre>\nThen you JSON now in the output var looks like:<p><pre><code>    {""id"":1,""title"":""Hello World""}\n</code></pre>\nThe example in the sibling comment shows the essence of the whole program with the email bit too, but this post shows some of the detail of actually fetching the record and marshalling it... there isn't much to it.",1364481537

It also comes from doing a ton of work on mission-critical systems where you don't do stuff like install the latest software updates without massive testing on off-line systems.<p>Yes, sometimes I miss out on really neat developments. iCloud is one of those cases where I am glad for being a slow adopter.  My mental red flags went up as soon as iCloud came out. Not one of my apps uses it.<p>On the end-user front iCloud is also an absolute mess.  I probably have a dozen i-devices on the same account (testing, etc.).  Crap appears and disappears from devices seemingly at random.  The worst of it was what is happening with my wive's iPhone and mined.  We share an iPad at home.  Now contacts are getting deleted from her phone and mine at random and so are notes.  It's at the point where she is not using notes any more because --her words-- they disappear within a hour or two of writing them.<p>Of course, turning off iCloud is the solution.  The problem is that this isn't as simple as throwing the switch.  If you turn off iCloud on your device it might actually delete things that it shoved into the iCloud service. And then it deletes the info from your other devices.  And it does this in some amazingly weird ways.  Without telling you what it is about to delete.<p>For example, I have never explicitly stored contact information on iCloud.  Never.  I type new or updated contact information into the phone. That's where it belongs.  In fact, I never even use my iPad for this.  Yet, some contact information for some strange fucking reason is sent over to iCloud.  The first time I turned off iCloud piles of contact data evaporated from my phone.  I had to turn the damn thing on again to get it back.<p>I haven't had the time to research how to fully disable iCloud on ALL of my devices while, at the same time, keeping or merging the state of my data on that particular device. As a developer I managed to avoid iCloud.  As a user I was not that fortunate, I succumbed to the new shinny thing on the shelf.  Now I want nothing to do with it.

I think this is something we should keep in mind when we're tuning performance-sensitive portions of APIs and the like.  We may actually need to revisit our framework choice and implement selected portions outside of it (just like ruby developers sometimes write performance-critical pieces of gems in C etc.) or optimize the framework further.<p>I'd like to crunch these numbers further to get a ""framework optimization index"" which would be the percentage slowdown or ratio of performance between the host platform and the performance of the framework on top of it.

That Control-x (C-x in Emacs lingua) is insanity at its best: due to the stupid non-symmetric layout of typical staggered keyboards 'x' in itself is one the hardest key to type (the equivalent with the right hand is way easier : '>' on a QWERTY keyboard).  I'm a touch-typist and to hit 'x' I need to move my whole hand a bit.  To hit '>' I just need to move on finger.  I blame this on the fact that keyboard are using a staggered layout instead of a matrix or symmetric layout but whatever.<p>Then Control.  Zomg.

Either directly or from within.<p>Having had occasion to debate about this on /r/childfree, I feel like a lot of their arguments are based on one of the following fallacies:<p>1) That there are ""too many people."" That may be true in parts of Africa, but in the developed world, the positive economic contribution of each additional person still vastly outweights the cost of their incremental strain on natural resources.<p>2) That depopulation in the future doesn't affect people in the present. If you're thinking of investing in a startup, what does it do to your calculus if you know that your customer base won't be any bigger in 20 years than it is today, and will be older?<p>3) There is no positive externality to having kids. Your average person is going to contribute millions of dollars in labor and social value (how much would you pay to save the life of a loved one?) over his or her lifetime.<p>4) Failure to look at the value of alternatives in incremental terms. The question isn't: what is the value of having kids versus doing a startup, it's: how much does having kids reduce my probability of doing a startup, and what is the weighted value of that relative to having kids.<p>5) Failure to account for the correlation between parent-child incomes. I'd say 90% of the kids from my high-income suburban middle school are now making median or above incomes. Maybe 7-10% are in the top 1% of income for their age bracket. High income people create a larger positive externality when they have kids.<p>6) Failure to weight the value of alternatives by probabilities. Your average person has very few alternative courses of action that is going to generate as much economic value as raising kids. Your high income person has has a greater probability of doing these things, but writing a best-selling book or founding a successful startup is far from guaranteed. So the relevant question is not: what has higher external social value, doing a startup or having a kid, but rather which of those has higher social value weighted by the probabilities that your startup will have any real success (low), or by the probability that your kid will achieve at least median economic success (quite high).<p>This is of course not to argue with anyone who chooses not to have kids. Nobody needs to justify personal decisions like that. But to the extent that they do try to justify it (and that's largely what /r/childfree is--people who feel the need to justify their decision), it's useful not to rely on fallacious reasoning to do so.",1364479492

Not everyone wants kids, plenty of people are already having kids, many people who do have kids regret it entirely, and many people correctly recognize that you can't live your dreams and raise your kids right. It's not just a financial lens for many people it's a time lens too.<p>Having kids whose lives you very probably won't even be allowed to be a part of is a reality for many guys too. Even if you have kids in marriage the reality is you will probably get a divorce, the kids will go to the mother, and you will pay.<p>Why risk it if you know you can avoid it? Having kids it's a guarantee of joy or satisfaction. Writing books, creating epic things can give just as much joy and satisfaction.<p>10 year at a time male birth control is coming so vasectomies will no longer be necessary. <a href=""http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-home</a><p><a href=""http://reddit.com/r/childfree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/childfree</a>",1364479358

Because Apple includes so many services under the umbrella term iCloud, it can lead to a very different impression of the service between the users and the developers.  All the talk about ""iCloud is broken"" is about one specific part, Core Data syncing.  The rest, like online backup and document syncing and calendars, seems to work most of the time.  I actually saw some comments elsewhere along the lines of ""iCloud works fine for me as a user, so it's probably just bad developers who can't get it to work, not any issue with Apple.""",1364479295

I've seen way too many comments that where downvoted only because of the tone (even though the content itself was very relevant), or because it expressed a dissident, politically incorrect idea. When I see such a comment being downvoted, I automatically upvote it, regardless of whether I agree or disagree with the content. I don't hang out here to read opinions I'm already agreeing with. I'm far more interested in intelligently argumented opinions that contradict mine. So, no it's not fun to be bashed by the sarcasms of someone else, but if the opinion contained in the bashing is relevant, then we should just suck it up, and answer to the content.",1364479257

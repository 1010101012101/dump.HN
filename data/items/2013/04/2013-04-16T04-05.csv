""Latency arb"" as you described it is HFT keeping all protected exchanges synchronized, and it is a good thing.  It means that everyone else can ignore the 13 exchanges, and send their orders to the market with the most competitive pricing for connectivity.  ""Latency"" arb"" as described in most literature critical of HFT is the specific practice of submitting and canceling non-bona-fide quotes to an exchange with the intent of slowing down the matching engine.  If you can slow down the matching engine that most other participants are using, you can effectively delay the public response your actions on the other 12 exchanges.

Boredom is a sign of duplication--not cut-and-paste duplication, but the more insidious duplication caused by poor abstractions.<p>In the example you gave (of a mocked up service), what would happen if you didn't mock the service? That would mean you couldn't call the service in your tests, right? (Except the tests that tested the service integration explicitly.) How could you change your design to make your code testable under that constraint?<p>The answer depends on your situation, but one way I've seen this play out in the past is to make more value objects and create a domain layer that operates on value objects rather than the service. The service is responsible for creating and persisting the value objects, but the domain layer handles the real work of the application.<p>As a result, testing the important part of the application can be done completely independently of the service. No mocks required. Now I can upgrade to FooService2 without changing any tests except for FooServiceConnection's. My value objects and domain layer remain unchanged.<p>If you're bored while programming, look for the duplication hiding in your design.

Or if you add a person from gender C to a group that was composed solely of gender D, does it increase or decrease the lab's total output because of different social dynamics? Or, if there are grants that are only accessible to gender E due to positive discrimination, does it make sense to lower their pay, since they can compensate through that grant?<p>The paper assumes independence between the gender of the applicant and the gender of the students of the professor, which isn't the case unless you hide the applicant in a room away from the current grad students.<p>Furthermore, the paper mentions that they used both Student's t-test and an ANOVA, both of which assume that the underlying data is normally distributed; there was no mention of a normality test anywhere in the paper. If the data is not normally distributed, which could be the case, then it's violating the normality assumption of both tests, which could potentially make them invalid.<p>Finally, are there other confounding factors in the study?

Off the top of my head:<p>- They only use consolidated feeds for US equities, never direct market-data feeds.  The consolidated feed necessarily contains less information that direct feeds (to satisfy more stringent bandwidth requirements), which masks some ""interesting"" effects of how the exchanges publish their data.<p>- They disregard that the CME feed publishes a fixed depth-of-book, and whenever they look at total liquidity in the book it can appear to flicker when deep levels fall ""out"" of the back of the book, even if liquidity is actually improving with the presence of a new inside level.<p>- They make a big deal about wholesaler matching only occurring when the consolidated book is not locked.  Their rationale is that subpenny prices are always wholesalers, and (erronously) therefore a lack of subpenny-priced trades must mean a lack of wholesale matching.<p>These mistakes sound believable, but they do not hold up to any of scrutiny.

5556299,comment,5554600,5554600,1,0,dvt,,,"Even though I can sympathize with the tone of the OP, I think his argument cannot be generalized. Consider the following scenarios:<p>A one-person engineering team. This is some 20-something working on a start-up in his parents' garage or the 40-something code hobbyist out there that likes writing fun little apps every now and then. I would argue that there is virtually no need for testing unless you're either bad at writing code or inexperienced. I've written dozens of applications (in various languages) and once you get into the swing of things, you don't need TDD to actually ""test."" Debugging/edge cases/etc. just becomes a natural process of writing code.<p>A two-person engineering team. This is a secondary stage in every start-up -- sometimes, start-ups even are founded by two engineers. Here is where TDD starts being important. I may be an expert coder, but if my partner isn't that great (or if our code doesn't work well together), not testing can be a huge nightmare. But the impact is still relatively small. Bugs are easy to spot as both engineers are (or at least should be) incredibly familiar with the <i>entire</i> codebase.<p>Three-person to 10-person engineering team. Here is where things get really tricky and TDD becomes integral to meeting deadlines and actually, you know, putting out products. You've got Jim working on some financial stuff while Bob is optimizing some JPA code. At the same time, Susan is implementing a couple of new features. Having a test suite ensures that behavior will remain predictable given non-centralized iterations. Without TDD, large teams would be fixing bugs more than they would be writing code (most teams probably do that anyway -- not that it's a good thing).<p>10+ people; open source projects, etc. When you have more than 10 people working on a project, I think that TDD is simply a necessity. There are simply too many moving parts. Without a cohesive test suite, having this many people mess around with code will undoubtedly break stuff.<p>Ironically, I think that small teams put too much emphasis on TDD, whereas teams in larger companies (AT&T and IBM, for example) put too little.",1366087537

In my experience:<p>1. I generally <i>don't</i> have trouble finding a module (library) that addresses my particular need. (I.e., when I go look for a library that does X, I generally find it.)  It does happen, but a lot less often than I expected.<p>2. I generally don't have the opposite problem either.  While in some ecosystems one finds so many libraries to address a particular need that it is hard to choose among them, in my experience that isn't (yet) a big problem with Node.  It does happen, but less than it does in, say, Ruby (or for that matter emacs-lisp) and it is generally pretty easy to identify the ""market-leader"" as it were.<p>3. The problem that I <i>do</i> run into in Node (with greater frequency than most ecosystems I've worked with) is that I'll stumble across minor bugs in the modules I'm using.  These tend to be moderately easy-to-fix issues that crop up in moderately-rare edge-cases, but they are definitely there. (I suppose this speaks to the relative maturity of the ecosystem.)<p>Counter-intuitively, I think this may actually be a good thing for the Node ecosystem. I'm reminded of the advice to open source developers to essentially ""leave something broken"" (or incomplete) so that potential contributors can make small-scale contributions [1].  A library that is too complete and well-designed is hard to contribute to (without investing a lot of time in understanding the architecture and direction of the project overall), but if you've got a library that does 95% percent of what you want, but fails on that one small edge case, more contributors are both willing and able to roll up their sleeves to scratch their particular itch.<p>[1] I can't remember or google-conjure the source of this advice right now.  For some reason I think it might have been Marc Andreessen, but it sure sounds like something ESR would say.",1366086755

If you plan to trade, then there are two ways that another participant can ""see you coming"":
1. If you don't have direct market access, your order gets routed through a broker.  The broker sees your order before it hits the market, and if he jumps in line ahead of you then that is front-running, and a Bad Thing.  Your broker can get in a lot of trouble for this sort of thing.
2. If you are trying to move a large position by sending multiple orders to the market (one after another), then all market participants have the chance to react to the first order.  It's really a game to try to move a lot of inventory at once, without tipping your hand to anyone else in the room.  Thems the breaks.
Nobody else gets to see anyone's order before the matching engine has already processed it, so there's no way to jump ""ahead"" of it.<p>OTOH, maybe your long-term investor is trying to time the market: wait for a signal intraday, and pick that moment to send an order.  In that case, if it is a good intraday signal then it is likely that someone else will compete.  It is unlikely for a long-term trader to have spent as much on infrastructure as a HF trader, so the juicy signals will result in missed executions that _look_ like front-running.",1366086426

I spent hours today chasing down bugs in code that I wrote over the last month that I would have never known were there if I had not been writing tests.  I value tests.<p>But on the other hand there is a valid role for experimenting and trying things out.  In that mode you're not writing production ready code - you're throwing stuff together.  When you write code in that mode, following a testing mantra is worse than useless.  I say worse than useless because the mental energy spent testing gets in the way of experimenting and refactoring.<p>The right way to reconcile those two modes is to write your experimental code, think about it, figure out how you want it written, then once you know how to write it, go back and write it ""for real"", complete with tests.

Egalitarian means that people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.  But open source communities do not treat people equally.

If you've learned to program and have time to contribute, you're likely to be able to have a significant impact on the project that you're interested in.<p>It is true that the economic barriers to entry are fairly low.  I've personally known multiple homeless people who found open source to be their gateway to learning a useful skill and getting a good job.  (Most who know the ones that I am thinking of do not know this detail of their lives...)  But there are other types of barriers to entry.  Language skills, intelligence, interest, etc.<p>It is easy to ignore those requirements.  But stop and think about the fact that significantly less than half of adults in the USA can read, write, and do math at a grade 8 level.  A lot of the reasons why have to do with unequal opportunities (bad schools, families that discount learning, etc).  The fact that open source communities ignore those people rather than actively seeking to give them access is a demonstration that open source is a meritocracy, not an egalitarian society.",1366085206

We are currently focusing on the 20-500 size events but will be be letting people select larger venues in the future (we are continuing to add larger venues even now).

The best part of awesome open source software is the ability to build even awesomer stuff on top.  Oracle sees it as a revenue source to be harvested; in general their business model is not about building awesomer and awesomer things, it's about maximizing the cash value of what they have.<p>The best corporate sponsorships of open source are when the interests of the company sponsoring are aligned with making the open source software as good as possible.  That is, the software is not a threat to parent company, but rather something that they want to be as good as possible because it enhances their product, and they're willing to let other people use it in order to help make it better.<p>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with what Oracle does, but at the same time, it behooves users of Oracle's open source software to be wary that they don't pull the rug out from under you.",1303353822

2469266,comment,2468987,2469084,13,0,chc,,,"Talking about ""Buddhism"" as a homogenous entity is a bit misguided. Sri Lanka is primarily Theravada, while Tibetans practice a religion that is essentially their native shamanism overlaid with some Buddhist ideas. Conflating the two is like looking at a story in which Catholics pray to Mary and saying, ""Nonsense! Christians only pray to Jesus. And he should know that, having lived in the largely Christian state of Utah for many years."" Catholics are not Mormons, and neither is really representative of Christianity in general.<p>Obviously the story is fiction, but Tibetan Buddhism is steeped in a lot of weird old rituals (not that they're sinister  just ancient and exotic). To me, it seems plausible enough for fiction that there could be some weird offshoot cult in Tibet that believed such a thing.",1303353768

Unfortunately these are circularly polarized.<p>In this Ohio theater they used a belt and suspenders approach where both polarization and timing were used to create the 3D effect. Left and right eye frames were projected through polarized filters and the projector itself was constructed so that one of the shutters would always be closed while the other was being displayed. The headsets handed out to the audience were active; they had LCD lenses and an IR receiver which would align the timing to the projector's.<p>This was purportedly done to increase decrease the ""crosstalk"" between the two eye views and worked quite well.<p>* Edited to reflect Cushman's observation on circular vs linear polarization.",1303353544

Using multiple accounts on a single iPod, while now possible, isn't exactly fun, since I have to switch accounts to even get <i>updates</i> for <i>free</i> apps, much less make purchases. All this, of course, wouldn't be an issue if the same music was available in all regions.<p>Don't get me wrong, I give Apple credit where it's due in getting the RIAA and MPAA on board, but as far as I can tell, they haven't done anything to fight region-based market segmentation - not that anyone else really has.",1303352401

Obviously 2-D shutter glasses wouldn't be very practical, but the polarization glasses (which I think is the standard?) should be just as feasible as the circularly polarized glasses used by RealD.<p>Come to think of it, normal polarized sunglasses should work as linear polarization filters assuming they line up the right way.",1303352092

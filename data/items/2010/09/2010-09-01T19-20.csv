I get that you don't have to have a rigidly defined table structure, and that your data structure can change when your application changes, but I guess I'm one of those curmudgeons that prefers rigidity over permissiveness.  I like that I have to think hard about my table structure and models before and as I code.  I also rarely feel bogged down by SQL, although I've been using it for over a decade, so that helps.<p>As for scalability, as this post shows, I think the best thing to come out of NoSQL is the race for greater scalability it has and will continue to inspire in SQL solutions.",1283370912

Say, the difference between living in a house, and owning 10,000 acres of development land in suburban San Diego. The first seems vaguely like a natural sense of possession, in that you live in a place, and you don't want people intruding into your bedroom and such. But owning huge tracts of land as an absentee landlord is more of a purely government-guaranteed notion of property, pretty disconnected from any natural sense of personal possession.<p>Put differently, property as a way of formalizing personal possession relationships is less objectionable to most anarchists (though many are skeptical of actually formalizing it) than property as a way of <i>creating</i> new kinds of ownership. You can see ownership of your house as just a formal ratification of ""I live in this house"", but ownership of 10,000 acres of land you've never visited is a pure creation of property-deed databases, and is hard to imagine existing without them.<p>(Whether that's good or bad, or what to do about it, is another story. I consider myself sympathetic to anarchist critiques and ideals, but putting forth workable concrete proposals is hard.)",1283367770

I'm from Newfoundland, Canada and I feel a kinship with other Newfoundlanders as well.<p>I can't speak to where you are from or what value set you have, but I feel it is important to support my country at all times, not just during the Olympics. I appreciate seeing other Canadians succeed and feel that it is good for Canada as a whole for them to do so.<p>Edit: Because I can't respond to the comment below, Im just going to follow up with the fact that if thats how you feel then you obviously don't have the same value set, or even understand what I am talking about. Which is totally fine, but I would guess that you don't care about someone you don't know succeeding or not, whether it has merit or not(which is also totally fine, just not how I feel).",1283367673

They just are using everything they can buy (at the right price, and in the right quantities), to make lots of small improvements, one at a time. Some ways to get better products are:<p>- Software optimizations mean less power usage.
- Moore's law means fewer chips, means more room for batteries.
  (example: AFAIK, the iPad does not have RAM outside of the CPU)
- Better batteries lead to higher power budgets.
- Cooler operation makes denser packaging possible (I bet those new
  iPods will feel really heavy in the hand)
- Non-replaceable batteries allow denser packaging.
- Custom chips for e.g. audio or video decoding may use less power than
  doing the same on the CPU.<p>They also are doing quite a bit to make their stuff look smaller than it is. The iPad, for instance, is about twice as deep in the center than at its edges. A custom-designed battery that is not a rectangular slab makes maximum use of that extra 'hidden' space.<p>What makes them hard to beat at this game is a) they are really good at it and b) they ship stuff in sufficient numbers to make the added costs of custom designs bearable. For example, that built-in mains adapter in the new Apple TV means that the device itself must be tested several times. It is way easier to buy an external adapter that already has passed those tests.",1283367635

10018183,comment,10017602,10017602,0,0,mtgx,,,"Innovation/progress and restrictions such as copyright and patents do seem to be inversely correlated for the most part. It&#x27;s often the case that when something is patented, others in the industry would rather completely avoid that technology until the patent expires (unless they think they can clone it without getting into legal trouble, which then defeats the point of a patent anyway).<p>Something similar happens with books too, where books are only popular for about 10 years at most if they are still under copyright, but those that are in the public domain are popular for decades or more.<p>Maybe there <i>should</i> be a balance, but what we have now in regards to both patents and copyright is likely not it, in the sense that copyright terms need to be greatly reduced, their impact somewhat more limited (some DMCA stuff is really abusive), and patents need to be accepted much less often and for actual inventions rather than obvious stuff that anyone could&#x27;ve invented.",1438883990

It&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t go to Kickstarter, copy all the work of a successful artist, and then do my own fund raisers and take their proceeds.<p>Kickstarter and Patreon fund future work, not past work.<p>This is actually what makes them so much <i>better</i> than the copyright-publisher model, because they prevent that exact scenario that you describe. If I record some music, sign it to a label, and then leave, the label owns the rights, and payments for copies of that music goes to them. If I record some music, give it away for free, and advertise a Kickstarter for my next album, nobody gains anything from trying to sell my <i>previous</i> album. You&#x27;re not paying for a copy of a work that was already worked; you&#x27;re funding the promise of me doing more work, and that promise has to come from the person who is actually doing the work. So the money has to go to the person actually doing the work.<p>Since there is no copy involved, copyright doesn&#x27;t help.

My test suite takes 21 seconds to run right now (including coverage analysis), which is pretty slow considering the number of components I have.

I&#x27;ve read many philosophical arguments about copyrights.<p>Some arguments against copyrights start from a <i>different premise</i> than you do.  Your question <i>assumes the premise</i> that the world &quot;owes&quot; artists the benefit of copyright.  No matter how strongly you feel about that, if you want to engage with the other side, you have to temporarily suspend that premise.<p>The counterargument says that copyrights for music, art, text is a <i>quirk made possible by technology</i> (Gutenberg press, vinyl & CD replication, etc.) instead of a fundamental  economic right.  They can point to other areas of creativity that don&#x27;t enjoy copyrights and yet new ideas flourish:<p>Andrew Wiles spends years solving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. He will get no copyright or royalties from that breakthrough.  He does get bragging rights.  So pure abstract mathematicians can&#x27;t get rich off of theorem proving and buy mansions and sports cars like Michael Jackson.<p>A chef or bartender inventing a new recipe for food or mixed drink can&#x27;t copyright their ingredient list. (They can keep it secret but &quot;trade secrets&quot; such as CocaCola formula is a different concept from copyrights.)<p>An interesting economic situation is poetry.  Poetry is copyrighted but hardly anyone can make a living at it.  Poets have day jobs such as a professor of English at a University.  The royalties from poetry books are miniscule.  If they give poetry recitals, it&#x27;s usually performed for free.<p>Does the world &quot;owe&quot; poets a living such that they don&#x27;t have to moonlight as an English professor?  Well, so far, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing.  They can&#x27;t buy mansions and sports cars, or even a middle class living with poetry royalties but they continue to write them.  One of the greatest poems/stories of all time is The Iliad and that never had copyright protection.<p>What would a world without copyrights for musicians look like?  Probably the non-performing musicians would have to moonlight with day jobs, or get sponsorships (patrons, crowdfunding). Etc.<p>That scenario looks &quot;worse&quot; because all of us discussing it were born after copyrights have been entrenched.  Like I said, we&#x27;d to have erase that premise to imagine it differently.<p>I find the counterarguments fascinating but I continue with pursuing copyright royalties because that&#x27;s the current configuration we live in.",1438883194

A LOT of that comes down to nursing.  The doctor may explain things incredibly well, but frequently patients turn and ask the nurse questions after the doctors leave the room, because they didn&#x27;t quite understand what was being said.  Also, it&#x27;s the nursing staff that&#x27;s toileting patients, getting and administering their meds, walking with them, talking with them about their condition, etc.<p>Pain management comes into it as well, but I also think that&#x27;s something that could be added to improved patient education in this country (per my commentary below).  For example, when people talk about their family members being in the hospital, and how their pain is bad, I ask why they don&#x27;t get palliative care involved.  9/10, I get &#x27;well they&#x27;re not at end of life, so why would I do that?&#x27;  Pallitive care focuses on quality of life at any point, and a large part of that is pain management.  Most people don&#x27;t know that, however, and the system is unfortunately set up such that patients and their family members often hold this (incorrect) belief on what palliative care does.",1438881424

This article is a very bad pop-science summary of relatively banal linguistic research.<p>Linguists have studied <i>linguistic universals</i> for a long time, which are properties that all human languages have. For example, one could try to imagine (in the style of Borges) a language which had no nouns, and in which all sentences are formed of relationships between verbs—but no natural language has this feature: <i>all</i> natural languages have nouns and verbs.<p>There are also <i>implicational universals</i>, which are of the form, <i>if [some language] has property X, then it will also have property Y</i>, and <i>tendencies</i>, which are broad driving trends that might have individual exceptions. An example of the latter is that languages that place the verb at the end of the sentence <i>usually</i> have postpositions rather than prepositions, but this has exceptions (e.g., Latin.)<p>What&#x27;s being studied here is a tendency in sentence structure: languages <i>usually</i> structure their syntax such that they can minimize the <i>dependency length</i>, or the distance between syntactically releated words in a sentence. This has long been hypothesized, but this paper gives evidence for it in the form of a large cross-language survey. Which is cool! But by no means does it have major implications for CS in any way. (At least, no more than any of the copious previous research on linguistic universals.)<p>EDIT: I should also add that this area of research is <i>not new</i>. In fact, linguist Joseph Greenberg published an article called &#x27;Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements&#x27; in 1963. This is continuing research and, while good research, not particularly groundbreaking or pioneering.",1438881327

1) hospitals get rated on &#x27;door to doc&#x27; time, so they tie part of compensation to this metric. It is measured based on the time when the doc clicks on your name in the computer, which is of course, not the same as when they actually see you, they might physically see you an hour later.
2) Some hospitals have a doc see you in triage. This is great for the hospital&#x27;s wait time numbers, but they are not going to be responsible for the whole of your care. They usually just order some medications or tests, then you wait for the &#x27;real&#x27; doctor to see you, which might take another hour or two.

Also I don&#x27;t think anyone in the world knows what an &#x27;exceptional engineer&#x27; is - If there even is such a thing.<p>If you put too much pressure on engineers to produce lines of code, they will optimize for that at the expense of quality/maintainability of the project.<p>I have worked for a number of startups which advocated the practice of &#x27;cutting corners&#x27;. I think it doesn&#x27;t work in practice because technical debt tends to creep up on you much sooner than you think. Unless the whole company&#x27;s future is hinging around meeting a specific deadline for a specific feature, then there is no excuse for cutting corners.<p>I think the personality of the engineer is much more important than their skills. I have worked at companies that fired people after the first month - This is ridiculous.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t fire a business executive after 1 month on the job because of poor growth metrics - The downtrend is probably a flow-on effect from past periods of mismanagement.
This is exactly the same in engineering. You can&#x27;t measure the consequences of technical decisions until many months of even years after they are implemented.<p>While you might think you&#x27;re firing &#x27;bad engineers&#x27; - You are in fact just firing random engineers based on random events like market timing, which team they are part of, direction of the wind, phase of the moon, etc...

vertices are simple, unstructured maps, so in my library you simply add a source entity when saving and all of the changes will be tied to that source.<p>Pseudo:<p><pre><code>    user = get_user(&#x27;emehrkay&#x27;)

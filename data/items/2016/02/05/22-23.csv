We do our best to react fast their requests.<p>We&#x27;ve made sure to document all the changes (even the statuses) in our blog post. We&#x27;ve sent it to all our users and placed it inside the dashboard to make sure everyone knows what changed and why it changed.

To put that in perspective, a little under half of that previous installed base was on CS6, while a modest majority were still on CS3-CS5.5. That suggests it may become harder for them to continue growing their CC subscriber base at the same rate if they approach a saturation point within the industry or at least within those parts of it willing to keep spending money on regular updates.<p>The other thing we should probably consider is that Adobe had almost a free ride in the early days of CC, as there was relatively little serious competition left in the industry. Now they&#x27;re starting to face credible threats, albeit mostly on a small scale or in specific niches for now, and if they lose mind share and eventually the critical mass that means everyone has to use CC because everyone uses CC, that could cause them some problems.<p>The next couple of years will be interesting for them. Presumably time will tell whether they can find ways to drive significantly more people to regular subscriptions than they used to get upgrading anyway, and whether they&#x27;ll be able to hold off any emerging competition.",1454712964

As in, letâs slice up a real human brain, map the neurons and synapses, and then simulate them as faithfully as possible.<p>To do that you need a great deal of fidelity in your simulations of neurons, which are enormously complex. But there is an argument to be made that neuronal complexity is incidental to the brainâs overall âcomputational capacityâ; that you could replace the neurons in a human brain with much simpler nodes and still end up with a functional intelligence, after sufficient rewiring.<p>I donât think that claim is <i>obvious</i>, but itâs definitely possible. And if itâs true, you can have human-level intelligence for 10^19 ops, given suitable software.<p>So I apologize for my post.

Often they&#x27;re part of the architecture of a system rather than the low-level functions and types that a developer creates. As an example, should you keep an in-memory queue (state) of jobs coming into your system or maintain a separate queue component (coupling). By extracting the state from your component and isolating it in Rabbit or some other dedicated state management piece, you&#x27;ve made the job of managing that state easier and more explicit.<p>As for complexity, there are many different types. Coupling is a form of complexity, but it&#x27;s not the only one. Cyclomatic complexity is another and one. Using regular expressions often increases the complexity of code. And one need only look at the spec for any reasonably popular hash function to see a completely different sort of complexity that&#x27;s not the result of either coupling unique paths through code. The composite of all the different forms of complexity is how I&#x27;d define it since they all add to a developers cognitive load.",1454711215

Honestly, the &quot;It&#x27;s the American government&#x27;s fault I&#x27;m in Russia&quot; argument that Snowden and his close supporters have been peddling isn&#x27;t really much of an argument when it effectively translates to &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for the US government I&#x27;d be in Cuba or Ecuador right now.&quot;<p>> Also worth noting that the crimes Snowden has been charged with are two counts of violating the Espionage Act, a law passed just after the US entered WWI.<p>I keep seeing this argument being brought up, too.

Thanks for raising this topic.<p>I was able to locate your account, and I see that I was the one who granted the credit and followed up via email. I hadn&#x27;t heard back from you until now, and I&#x27;m happy that we have an open line of communication. I&#x27;m hopeful that this thread starts a conversation, that it clarifies what steps we take, and we might even uncover a different solution that works well for everyone.<p>To start with, I want to be really clear, this is the absolute worst case scenario. I absolutely don&#x27;t want it to happen to any customer, let alone someone who has been with us for such a long time. There&#x27;s really a delicate balance that we must strike between customers who forget to pay and customers who do not want to pay.<p>Currently, our notifications for overdue balances are sent via email. If a customer account is unpaid on the first of the month, we send ~15 emails total notifying the customer of the situation, and subsequently power off servers 21 days after the account is on hold as a further way to gain your attention. At this time, droplets are removed from your account 14 days following power off, which is an increased amount of time from what you experienced. It was increased from 3 days based on past user feedback.<p>Why do we do it this way? In the past, we had no hold or suspension process for non-payment, which enabled bad actors to run for months and months without paying. From a business perspective, we made a decision to put a scalable process in place that limited how long an account could go unpaid.<p>As a support team and business, we are always willing to work with our customers who are unable to pay. We are always available via ticket, our contact form, and have made wide-ranging attempts to help users who aren&#x27;t able to pay due to banking regulations: <a href=""https://insidedigitalocean.com.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://insidedigitalocean.com..</a>.<p>I&#x27;d like some input, so I&#x27;ll publicly ask for feedback on questions that I&#x27;ve asked privately before. I&#x27;d also like any other feedback that we can consider on how to make this a more positive experience for everyone<p>-Knowing that we do not do phone support, what&#x27;s the best way to notify you of a past-due balance? \n-Is SMS effective at times like this?<p>I would love to hear your thoughts.<p>Thank you,\nZach\nzach@digitalocean.com",1454710209

With some the idea of talking about work is deeply upsetting, they just cannot bounce back, pick themselves up, learn a new skill and get set into a new career. To them I should be an example of how it is done - I had to change career a few years ago, and despite being long in the tooth with no formal university education in things like OOP, I was able to learn enough to get a programming gig and move on from there.<p>I do e-commerce for my sins and I am fortunate enough to always get work. Last time I had to pick up the phone I had 12 interviews lined up by tea time with a couple of those being of the &#x27;start Monday&#x27; variety. From this perspective I am aware that, for what I do, there are more jobs than candidates.<p>Sometimes I watch the news and see some story about unemployment, particularly among the younger entrants into the job market. Normally you have some talking heads in the news article where the government gets blamed for individual circumstances of despair and no opportunity. I then feel bemused, and wonder why the world of work is how it is with companies like my current employers unable to find me a front-end dev for love or money. Sure we would take zero experience for the right candidate, although a few years of experience would be far preferable. I truly doubt we would have more candidates even if there were a million out of work coal miners in a five mile radius, that is what I find odd about this article is that there were &#x27;1000 applicants&#x27;.<p>For all of my out-of-work friends I do try and find them some work, even if they are not able to enter the job market properly. I can conjure up some translation work (for those that have a different mother tongue) or some customer service work (that requires no pre-requisite skills). I also offer to train them up in everything I know.<p>But do these opportunities, even the easiest, baby-step stepping stones get followed up on? No!!! Never!!!<p>Those of us in the world of work, able to get up in the mornings and able to wear clean clothes doing as we are told working for the man at some desk all day with a convenient pay check just do not &#x27;get it&#x27; when it comes to understanding the long term unemployed. To us it seems obvious - learn a new skill, get some experience, put together a portfolio, move to a new area, but many, many people are fundamentally depressed and excluded from the job market. Our advice and gentle nudges falls on deaf ears. We don&#x27;t understand them and they don&#x27;t understand us. Articles like this one and every news article ever written on unemployment just has this naive view of things and never touches on the issues of self esteem and confidence that haunt many job seekers.",1454709965

Ten or twenty years from now, I imagine weâll be dealing with a novel set of ML tools that will evolve with the rise of quantum computing (the term âmachine learningâ will probably be ancient history, too), but the essence of these methods will probably remain: to train a mathematical model to perform task X while generalizing its performance to the real world.<p>As fascinating and exciting as this era of artificial intelligence is, we should also remember that these algorithms are ultimately sophisticated classifiers that don&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; anything at all.",1454709729

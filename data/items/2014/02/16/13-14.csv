7247641,comment,7247095,7247409,2,0,VLM,,,"Not to derail this completely, but only about 60% of the US population have jobs.  The rest are either too young, too old, too sick, criminal record, credit/security risk, drug history, too unemployable, too skilled/expensive to hire, whatever.  So applying a metric of value that only has meaning for 60% (and dropping) of the population to the entire population is a mistake.  Also at least anecdotally I can&#x27;t get overtime pay so my opportunity cost is about zero.  True, I could look for short term contracts or take up day labor, but ... If it takes me less labor hours to repair something on the desk than to drive out to the apple store and wait in line and drive back, I&#x27;m ahead of the game.  As a skilled artificer I have disassembled and repaired mac minis in less than this journalists three hours.  Getting to the optical drive in a mid 2011 mini is not amusing.<p>Anyway the relevance is I&#x27;ve been rolling this around in my head for awhile WRT a local disabled veterans group.  The prison industrial complex has completely captured the &quot;recycle old desktop PCs&quot; market but I think the disabled veteran group could enter and take over the phone/tablet glass replacement market.  One UK journalist took three hours, and cultural similarity between US and UK would imply as a journalist she probably never held a screwdriver before in her life.  In comparison two disabled veterans working as a team, each with an arm shot off (or cognitive brain damage, or in wheelchairs, or PTSD anger issues, or whatever) might take an entire 8 hour day and still might not succeed, but if the primary purpose is therapeutic giving a feeling of usefulness, and social interaction, and maybe some manual dexterity, who cares?<p>I&#x27;ve little contact with the disabled veterans group other than being a non-disabled ex-dotmil guy who makes donations once in a while.  There&#x27;s nothing &quot;disabled veteran&quot; about this idea, so someone else in another area could likely apply this idea to any disabled services organization.  Anyone want to &quot;steal&quot; this idea does it with my blessing.  No idea how to turn this into a startup other then existing competitors, but if you can do it, best of luck.",1392559124

But the problem is that OP is giving as an example a team, without strictly defining the expected behaviour of that class, so everyone starts to imagine his own set of behaviour ovverides, invariants, and so on, and in many cases they are right (the salient point of subclassing is method overriding).<p>The problem really starts when an invariant supported by a superclass is broken by it subclass. For instance, the idea that a player is unique in a team is obvious, so as said elsewhere in this thread, the Add method, whose invariant is to increment by one the size of the list (because duplicates are allowed, and pretty much no predicate other than equality is applicable to a generic type), would be broken by that Team subclass, and thus any function relying on that implicit behaviour (afaik, c# doesn&#x27;t implement contracts) would break.<p>That Liksov substituton principle is tough indeed.",1392557796

7247593,comment,7247064,7247290,7,0,Hermel,,,">> It&#x27;s not that complicated.<p>Actually, it is complicated. If you are selling a service from the US to European end-users, you owe VAT in each European country you have customers in. You can simplify the process with a special registration with the tax offices in one country (e.g. Germany) and send all the owed taxes there. They will then further distribute it to the other countries. Also note that to do it correctly, you need to charge the right rate in each country. Generally, every EU country has a different tax rate and every few months, it changes somewhere. In order to be able to automate this, the EU offers an API that returns current VAT rates.<p>To further complicate the issue, there are numerous exceptions. E.g. special rates for food and touristic services, that differ from country to country. Things are simpler when selling to companies, in which case it is the responsibility of the importing buyer to declare VAT correctly. But to do so, you need to ask your users whether they are companies and if yes, they have to provide you with their VAT registration number so you can validate them.",1392557605

For example, consider the iPhone&#x27;s non-user-replaceable battery; one of the most commonly heard reasons for it is that it makes for a thinner device and a bigger battery. But an interesting device I saw recently made me question that; the Jiayu G5. It&#x27;s an Android phone that looks almost exactly like the iPhone (only very slightly larger), with a metal casing and a removable battery plus dual SIM and expandable storage. It&#x27;s only 0.25mm thicker but its battery has 33% more capacity.

I would pick Java and whatever the best of the REST APIs is. Use that with some of the most popular database ORM tech, etc. It&#x27;s easy to find people and you can find those who know how to make it fast.<p>For the front-end I&#x27;d pick AngularJS personally. I used Backbone.js for a couple of years so I know what that world is like. Ember.js might be a good choice as well but it seems like AngularJS is going to swamp it due to popularity.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t generate any pages in the back-end at all (the exception being a couple of one-off servlets if I have binary files or other things to download which are more easily generated in the back-end). All pages would be static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and rendering would all happen on the front-end.<p>It&#x27;s easy to work on, it&#x27;s easy to figure out where bugs are (just look at the JSON flowing back and forth), and if you focus 100% of your security on that API and making sure that you never send anything you shouldn&#x27;t to the front-end and that you validate everything the front-end sends to the back to the n-th degree, you&#x27;ll never have security woes.",1392557078

Saying you want the Nazi party back, or want to kill the Jews, or wearing a Swastika is not covered by free speach.<p>One thing I also like is the strong protection of customers. Decieving your customers is also never covered as free speach. There are some laws that seem silly, governing the way products are advertized. E.g. you must use metric units, if you use imperial units (mainly for screens), the metric units must be displayed more prominently, you must have certain package sizes, you have to display the price for 100g / 1kg beneath goods in shops, etc.. I never appreciated these laws until I noticed how confusing and customer-deciving pricing is in the US. Like Mac & Cheese, 20 cents a package, but in the fine print it says only if you buy 10, otherwise its 80 cents.

With 1440p you will still notice the screen door, especially in the distance (the sky), and it looks like we&#x27;ll only solve this with the 4k resolution, when the resolution seems to become &quot;normal&quot;, and without easily noticeable pixel lines, but it will probably be at 8k when we&#x27;ll have &quot;retina&quot;-like quality.<p>All of that being said, I think 95+ percent of consumers buying the 1440p version won&#x27;t even notice the small pixel lines in the distance, because they&#x27;ll be so &quot;present&quot; in those VR worlds. Most &quot;normal&quot; people trying it out quickly forget about the screen door even with the 800p developer kit, because they&#x27;ve never experienced something in VR before, and to them it feels very real already. Personally, I do hope they can use the 4k resolution in the second consumer version as soon as possible, but I think the 1440p one will do just fine with all the early adopters.",1392555729

7247511,comment,7246746,7246746,1,0,oneeyedpigeon,,,"In part, this is a confusion caused by semantics and inherent difficulties with any kind of abstraction. The notion of a &#x27;team&#x27; in real life is a very flexible one, and as soon as we try to represent it using a concrete data structure, we&#x27;re bound to run into problems. The questioner shouldn&#x27;t be blamed for thinking a team and a list of players are one and the same - there are many real life examples in which the two are used interchangeably. If anything, this highlights the challenge of OOP: real life objects and their relationships are just really difficult to model in a deterministic way.",1392555660

The reason a tiny fraction of successful experimentalists are older than a tiny fraction of successful theoreticians is the theory guys can implement the monkeys on typewriters and the one who writes Shakespeare accidentally can be anointed as genius.  However the experimentalist has to actually make something work, which takes a lot longer to learn how to do.<p>Also money.

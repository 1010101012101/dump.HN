1949734,comment,1947768,1947954,0,0,linhir,,,"In short: cables are the official record and communication tool of the diplomatic corps. As several other replies have pointed out, cables are a form of electronic communication, but they aren't emails. That may sound like a meaningless distinction, but in the everyday business of the department it is real. If you work at DOS, you usually have two email addresses--one on the unclassified and one on the classified network. Additionally, you can have access to a system to read, review and send cables. Think of them as official inter-office memos, or something like that. They're formatted in a specific way, and they do not, under any circumstances, travel on any communications systems not completed operated by the US Government. You get the sense of what I mean by format if you look at some of the documents on the NYT site (or sit down, as I have, and read a few thousand cables in a row). If you're the Ambassador to Country X, and you have a meeting with the President of X, you write a memo, in a particular format, with each paragraph classified U/SBU/C/S/TS, and in a pretty particular tone. That memo (cable) then gets sent to, who knows, the Assistant Secretary for the Region X is in, an Undersecretary or two, the OPs center, the Deputy, etc.",1291017250

I disagree that designers are inherently perfectionists; that is simply an effect of trying hard to be your best.  I have found that being obsessive about making awesome code has transferred quite well to web design.<p>The ""just learn it yourself"" camp is being a little delusional if they think you're going to be able to pick up something and do it well.  I respect the bootstrappers who are making lemonade out of their lemons, I'm one of them myself, but it takes more than a couple weekends to develop quality skills.  Sometimes you should just bite the bullet and delegate where necessary.<p>I hired an illustrator for one of my recent side-projects because I found it more important to have good work done rather than doing something badly myself and wasting a bunch of time in the process.  If the skill is something you will utilize frequently in the future, then it might be worth the up-front cost.

It's also making things readable, making things easy to use, your conversion elements easy to find.

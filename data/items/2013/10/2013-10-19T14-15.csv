By the time you&#x27;re 30-40 it&#x27;s amazing how much smarter the rest of the world got.  You can take my word for it as regards politics and investment, or not, it&#x27;s your money.<p>On the argument, you&#x27;re implicitly admitting that you wouldn&#x27;t spend bitcoins until you were completely out of dollars, because bitcoins will &#x27;always appreciate&#x27;.  That&#x27;s kinda conceding my point as far as asset vs currency.  You can sell stock for dollars if you&#x27;re short on cash as well.<p>It seems that we agree on the effects of deflationary currency incentivizing not spending money.

And I really don&#x27;t think my age is relevant, you either have arguments or you don&#x27;t.<p>But let&#x27;s come back to that notion of yours<p><i>> If you&#x27;re always incentivized to hold something and never incentivized to spend it, it becomes more of an asset than a currency.&quot;</i><p>Let&#x27;s say all you got is 10btc and $0 in your bank account. And you need some food. You&#x27;re probably gonna decide not to starve yourself to death because being alive tomorrow is more valuable to you than having more money and being dead. Thus you are going to spend your bitcoins (either directly or by exchanging them into fiat).<p>Now, what you probably wouldn&#x27;t do is buy something you don&#x27;t really need or want at the moment. And that&#x27;s fine, in this case Bitcoin encourages responsible spending. Now, of course, you should understand why a deflationary currency grows long term - not speculation, but new products and services in the economy. If no one spends, then no new products and services appear, currency is not gaining in value. If it&#x27;s not gaining in value anymore you have your incentives to spend back.<p>The major differences with a deflationary currency are this:
1. No one forces you to spend (like governments inflating your money), so you make decisions on your own.
2. Deflation is an ultimate tax that rich cannot avoid. If you make money, you will inevitably share it with the rest (their money gaining in value).",1382194292

6576458,comment,6575994,6576329,8,0,dfox,,,"There isn&#x27;t any significant hardware-wise difference in most SMPSs between today and say 20 years ago. The main cause for essentially every wall wart being SMPS is simple economies of scale and globalisation:
* Difference between power supplies for different countries amounts mostly to plug shape, you don&#x27;t need different transformers for 110 and 230V.
* The whole power supply is smaller and lighter, so it&#x27;s cheaper to ship it around the world
* SMPS is simplest way to meet requirements on cos phi, efficiency and idle power in some jurisdictions.<p>In end when you are designing product that does not have any special requirements on power quality (like precision instruments) or customer expectation that it should be big and mostly empty (home AV stuff) it is simply cheapest to order SMPS wall-warts from China in bulk.",1382191832

In practice the shock that ending that will cause will end any hope the US has of paying back it&#x27;s debt, or even the interest on it, immediately. So it will cause an immediate default and destroy the economy that promised to pay it back in one fell swoop. There&#x27;s no way out of that situation that doesn&#x27;t involve reneging on repayment. Either directly (any sovereign nation, like the US, can simply legislate it&#x27;s debt away like Greece -partially- did, and counterintuitively investors have no choice and will immediately reinvest, again, like Greece demonstrated)<p>So the US, like every other nation on this planet (barring a few, but only a few exceptions), has zero hope of ever paying back it&#x27;s debt. So it won&#x27;t.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the illusion can&#x27;t last a few more decades or even a century or two (though only a few states managed to make it last even a single century, the most famous being the Roman republic).<p>The reason that everybody&#x27;s happy with this state of affairs is that it allows, at this moment, an economy that&#x27;s factors larger than it would otherwise be.<p>This situation came to be as an &quot;accident&quot; (that has happened hundreds of times before in history), and there simply is no conceivable way out. Anybody who can rattle the boat risks losing big, even if it&#x27;s monetary interests are protected, so the situation keeps existing until someone really, really goes too far.<p>Apres nous, le deluge.

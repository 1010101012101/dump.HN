You can delay ordering the new card because Simple lets you instantly block all transactions on your card—and unblock them just as instantly. Effectively, if you see a fraudulent transaction or are worried, you can pull your phone out, block the card, and only unblock it when you go to actually swipe the card. Then, when the timing is better, you can go ahead and order the new card. After also having withdrawn cash to cover the time difference, or having sent yourself a check, or whatever.<p>The only thing to be wary of is that you can&#x27;t dispute fraudulent transactions way in the future, so your window isn&#x27;t infinite.",1392929996

It didn&#x27;t give me enough control over what I wanted to do so I figured out how to do it manually.<p>My response is a bit more rambling than I intended for it to be and I hope you can piece it together. :) My main point is that we both ended up with the same choice (ASP and ASP.Net) around the same time but I also have those bullet points you mention checked off.  I don&#x27;t regret my decision one bit and I don&#x27;t think it has stunted my professional growth at all.

To my mind, half the reason to have code reviews and continuous integration is to make sure that the project history is coherent and bisectable.<p>Some might argue that non-pristine patches shouldn&#x27;t be pushed in the first place, but let&#x27;s be honest: we&#x27;re all human, we all make mistakes, and this is (again) why we have code reviews and CI.<p>I can understand having options, and I&#x27;ll admit that Gerrit seems good enough to me, mostly because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used. But I&#x27;ll counter that successive patches are recorded in the history of Gerrit, along with commentary and the back and forth. I can see the pros to having smaller isolated commits, but one best practice recommends writing the tests first (and having them fail), then write the feature; in this workflow, you would <i>not</i> want to push failing tests separately because it would break bisect, and the CI won&#x27;t let it through anyway.",1392926802

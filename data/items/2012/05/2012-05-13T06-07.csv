However, I don't see why that should make it a right.<p>A right to me is a powerful thing. It is something that the government or others cannot take from you, no matter what. Eg, free speech - no person or government can compel you to not express your opinion. Or, freedom of religion - no person or government can compel to believe in a certain deity.<p>Consider this, things are relatively good in the western world right now in a grand historic sense. So governments have the ability to bestow ""rights"" like access to broadband. But what if things get really bad financially and the government and telcos of the nation can no longer afford to maintain broadband access to all citizens? Suddenly the government is forced to revoke a right because it is broke. I contend that if that can happen, it probably wasn't a right in the first place. Now, free speech on the other hand is something that will never have to be revoked no matter the financial status of a nation. That to me is truly a right. It is the difference between promising a person a printing press and promising a person that he may print whatever he wants on his own printing press.",1336891725

>>the Finnish government said that no household ""would be farther than 2 kilometers from a connection capable of delivering broadband Internet with a capacity of at least 100 megabits of data a second.""
>That doesn't say anything on who's going to pay, probably the people.<p>That's why I said <i>access</i> to a consumer good and nothing about who pays. That said, as far as I can tell, there isn't a western democracy that forbids their people from buying internet access. So if this doesn't have anything to do with assisting people to pay for it and they aren't banned from buying it themselves, what does it do?<p>In reality this does have to do with assisting them to pay for it, because mandating construction of broadband connections is just a roundabout way of helping pay for it.<p>>What do you mean by ""cheapens the concept""? I don't understand this formulation. What concept?
>From my point of view, water and food could be called consumer goods. Access to food is already a human right (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_food</a>) while it's not yet settled 100% that water is a human right (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_water"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_water</a>)<p>This is exactly what I mean. You are comparing getting internet access to getting food and water. If you don't have food and water, you die. If you don't have internet access, then yes you don't have access to the best, most modern way to communicate. However, in a nation with free speech you have access to many other ways to express yourself.

3966227,comment,3965588,3965983,2,0,dsrguru,,,"That just becomes a debate about the definition of a functional language.  The point is that unlike Haskell, SML, and OCaml (the last two aren't ""pure"" in the sense of syntactically enforcing referential transparency like Haskell, but they strongly encourage a functional design), Racket is first and foremost a LISP.  You can use it to write and make use of a lot of functional abstractions, and it certainly is better suited to that style of programming than C or Java is, but Python and Ruby are just about equally suited for that style of programming, and they even have equivalents of map, filter, fold, lambda, etc.<p>Racket code doesn't look like Haskell, the MLs, or even dynamically typed ""functional"" languages (like Erlang).  It looks like LISP.  What drives your coding is not functional abstractions or object-oriented data structures (which it can do equally well) or anything like that.  What drives your coding is the fact that syntax itself is a first-class data structure.  You have access to the reader.  You can write macros that adapt the language to anything you want.  You can write a DSL in a few hundred lines that might save you tens of thousands of lines.<p>Now, Racket is certainly good for functional programming.  In fact, some Racket developers prefer the Scheme-style tail recursion method of iteration (via the named let or letrec) to the looping constructs provided in the library, even when for loops would be just as effective.  In the same way, not all Common Lisp programmers like the loop macro, and some (e.g. pg) actually use Common Lisp in a style that resembles functional programming.  However, don't think of Racket as a functional language.  That's as misleading as calling C++ a procedural one, even though you could write all your code C-style without ever using objects.  Racket is a LISP, which means it can be adapted to fit virtually any paradigm.  Racket is far closer to Common Lisp and Clojure than it is to literally any non-LISP.",1336890496

That is: housing reflects the local prevailing wage.<p>It makes zero sense to rent a property (as a wage earner) for more than one can make in income living in the area.  Hence, rents tend to be much more responsive to wage inflation/deflation than housing prices (student and retirement housing would be exceptions, but they're constrained by similar functions ultimately).<p>With real estate, there is the potential for appreciation gains.  This presumes, however, that there's someone willing to buy at the appreciated property later.  Housing prices cannot inflate indefinitely over other assets.  And the long-term historical return on housing (since the 1880s or so in the US -- period for which data are available) are in fact lower than most forms of investment.  Housing carries heavy costs:  taxes, maintenance, improvements, etc.  And it's largely an illiquid asset, particularly for the small investor (I may have many of a smaller investment to sell, I generally only transact in a single house at a time).<p>There are other tweaks on this:  rental/owner-occupied housing aren't perfectly substitutable (covenants, HOA restrictions, etc.), there are non-financial returns to housing (or at least longer-term returns), notably school district access and crime/safety rates.  In markets with low vacancy rates, rental values may fluctuate more broadly.  Bank lending practices may make buying easier (2000s) or harder (2010s) at any given time.<p>But the upshot is still:  rental prices in a given market tend to be a better guide to local economic conditions than real estate prices.",1336889718

3966198,comment,3965588,3965808,5,0,zem,,,"parsing is absolutely the sort of problem for which functional programming excels. if you think about it, there is no time dependence, no need to respond to external inputs, no concurrent access to mutable data, none of the things that would make pure functional programming a constraint rather than a help. all your are doing is writing one conceptual function of the form output = f(input), and that transformation is in turn made up of smaller transformations that can be written and tested independently, and then composed together to build up the solution.<p>now it might still be a little harder to do this sort of thing in haskell, which is aggressively pure, simply because some algorithms are pure from the outside but have internal steps that involve mutating data for efficiency. but racket is not a pure functional language; if you need to, say, transform an array in place rather than take an array and return a new one, it will not stand in your way. the difference between racket and, say, java, is not that it enforces functional over imperative programming, but that it makes functional programming a lot easier, and fp has a lot of powerful tools in its toolbox for tackling this class of problem.",1336889269

3966192,comment,3964774,3964774,8,0,Shenglong,,,"Reading this article was oddly reminiscent, as he sounds like me when I was younger. In fact, I can seem to relate to a large portion of the article. Let me try and shed some light on several points:<p><i>His gaze settled on Allan. Grabbing a wooden chair, he hoisted it overhead as though to do violence but paused for several seconds, giving Miguel a chance to yank it away.</i><p>Right - first, psychopaths (let's just call it that for now) absolutely understand reward and punishment. The question, however, becomes more ""can I avoid the punishment?"" rather than ""oh no, if I do that, will I be punished?"" It's not entirely conscious - it's natural. Maybe this only happens with a certain degree of intelligence, but if his parents made it clear that he'd have no way of weaseling out of a punishment, and would be caught for sure, then it would deter his behavior. That is, of course, unlikely. His parents are emotional, and I'm sure he knows it. Either that, or the punishment just isn't affecting him. He just screams and pretends, so they won't try something new. All tactics I've used. He realizes that if he throws the chair, he will ACTUALLY get in trouble. He just wanted to get a point across. He overreacts, and his parents respond accordingly, and lectures his brother. Win-win.<p><i>Some, including Michael, were actually worse; one had begun biting the counselors.</i><p>This is probably misrepresented. When a kid throws a tantrum, often the counselors will try to restrain him. Yes, this happened to me (twice). If the kid cannot use his arms or legs, it should really be expected that he's going to bite. He believes he has a logical reason for throwing a fit - restraining him isn't going to change that.<p><i>Coldblooded, callous-unemotional children, by contrast, are capable of being impulsive, but their misbehavior more often seems calculated. Instead of someone who cant sit still, you get a person who may be hostile when provoked but who also has this ability to be very cold. The attitude is, Lets see how I can use this situation to my advantage, no matter who gets hurt from that. </i><p>I'd argue that psychopaths have both 'hotblooded' and 'coldblooded' elements. Which they display at any given time, is simply a question of which has the most reward. If the situation is hopeless, even the most hotblooded psychopath will return to being coldblooded. They'll probably never swallow their pride, but they'll win, one day. The trick is understanding their logic - because their logic is more cause-effect, than reflecting on societal norms we've grown up with.<p><i>So they dont develop the same aversion to punishment or to the experience of hurting someone.</i><p>That's not true at all. My parents used to beat me (Chinese family, accepted norm) when I threw tantrums and did something wrong. I used to hate it, but I doubt I would've grown the same way without it. Rather than having to form my own mental punishment, I could relate ""if I do this, I'll get beat"". Then the question became, ""is it worth the potential of a beating, and can I prevent them from finding out?"" Psychopaths understand punishment just fine... at least intelligent ones do. When I entered high school, however, I found out that any suspensions go on my record for University. I also heard that good universities don't accept people with bad records. I was suspended over 50 times in elementary/junior high, but since high school, I've had excellent behavior. It's easy to trick your parents into thinking you're remorseful... it's harder to convince an organization that deals with thousands of applications.<p><i>In another study, the researcher Mark Dadds found that as C.U. children matured, they developed the ability to simulate interest in peoples feelings.</i><p>It's not just simulating interest - it's simulating emotions altogether. It was difficult as a child, but over the years, I've learned what emotions are supposed to be, when people display them, and what degree they should be displayed. Hence, if a psychopath starts to live two different lives, they can easily switch between different levels of emotional display. It makes adaptation a lot easier, and people don't really consciously notice.<p>It's like programming. if(situation) { respond(situation.severity)} Eventually, you get to see enough situations, and can extrapolate responses for situations you haven't seen. Once in a blue moon, you're completely off. That isn't to say ALL emotions are restricted. Shame, guilt, fear, sadness, and love may be difficult, but happiness, boredom, and anger come easily.<p>All in all, I feel people really misunderstand psychopaths. If you're a parent, and have psychopathic children, find something they inherently cannot live without, and threaten it. Beatings may work, but it's not fool proof. You can't starve them, because they realize it'll hurt you more than it'll hurt them, and mutually assured destruction (up to a point) is acceptable. Remember - it's not how they inherently behave. It's how they behave, given the circumstances. Instead of trying to fix the root problem, go after a symptomatic treatment. Just because they misbehave, doesn't mean they won't be productive members of society later on.",1336889079

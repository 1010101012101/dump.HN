2548899,comment,2547887,2548097,3,0,raisenBran,,,"I think you are missing the main point that the article is arguing.<p>You're right about Google. They do not need Skype, but the article does not say anything about Google needing Skype at all. The article only said Microsoft needed Skype. It was a defensive measurement on Microsoft's part.<p>I think this is the most important sentence of the article: ""Were Google to buy Skype theyd convert those 663 million Skype subscriptions to Google Voice and Gmail and in a swoop make parts of Yahoo and MSN irrelevant."" This is important for a number of reasons.<p>1. If Google were to buy Skype, the 663 million users would probably convert to Google's search engine - if they have not already - and not use Bing, which Microsoft has invested heavily in.<p>2. By buying Skype, Google could force the 663 million users to only register with a Gmail account. Meaning, those with an MSN email account would be forced to convert.<p>3. Google would also integrate Google Voice with Skype. With the two utilities working together, they would make an incredibly powerful tool, and the users might start to rely on the two combined utilities. This would mean the users would want the utility on their phones which entices them to buy an Android phone and not a Windows phone.<p>4. With the buy, Google was looking ahead in the future. They could integrate Skype with Google TV. (Which I know was first a failure, but they are still banking on the idea. They'll come out with it again soon enough.) They would also integrate with Chrome OS, and, if the users come to rely on it heavily with the integration of Google Voice and Android, then it would entice them to us Chrome OS and not Windows.<p>I think Google had much more use for Skype compared to Microsoft. So, Microsoft did not buying it to go after the consumers of Google and Apple; instead, they mainly bought it to keep their users.",1305417524

Gcc programmers are smarter than an average programmer. If it was easy, they would have gotten it right on the first try. Accordingly, C or Java or C# or Go compilers didn't have such problems so C++ is more complex for compiler writers than pretty much every other known language.<p>The same goes for error messages. In the past decades we've had tens of C++ compilers. If clang is the first one that is able to generate decent error messages for templates, then it means it was a hard problem to solve.<p>None of that got any easier: if you want to write another C++ compiler, it'll still be hard for you to generate decent error messages or compile tricky C++ code reasonably.",1305417199

Let's suppose that there are roughly a trillion, that is, 2^20, files; this is way more than the actual number of files, by the way.  And let's suppose that we have a 256-bit hash such that every 256-bit string is equally likely(a reasonable assumption as long as the hash hasn't been defeated)--the number of possible hashes is 2^256.  So the chance of a collision is roughly 1-e^(-2^80/(2^257)); since the number inside the exponential is so small, we can approximate it as 2^-177, or less than 10^-53.  That number is so small that it's more likely your office will get hit by multiple independent meteors.<p>[1]This formula is taken from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox</a>",1305417179

2548884,comment,2548190,2548421,2,0,MichaelGG,,,"If it's user@domain, it's probably just using SIP URI routing. (You define records in your domain to lookup the responsible SIP server, similar to how email works, but more complicated just for the fun of it.)<p>FreeSWITCH is a great starting point, but NAT traversal isn't reliable for point to point, for the general case. You have to consider symmetric NAT without UPnP  and firewalls that allow outbound+response, but no incoming. In these cases, you are going to need a proxy with a public IP that can relay audio. That's the only reliable thing that's going to work in all cases. (Just look at the IETF's documents on NAT traversal where they come up with all these complex ways to try to exploit limitations in certain NAT devices...)<p>Actual NAT traversal in SIP/RTP is very straightforward. You just ignore the silly parts in spec that specify IPs, and just reply to the IP:port combo you received from. For RTP, same deal. You know where you'll receive RTP, so as soon as you get a packet there, you just reply to the IP:port it came from.<p>Skype's ""breakthrough"" that let them win so much early on was that they used P2P to do public IP relays, since connectivity between any two points is not guaranteed. (Had MS been smart enough to proxy audio/video in their clients early on, they might have dominated this market to begin with...)<p>So, to overcome this with free software, they'd need a public IP relay system that protects things end-to-end. If they do that, it could be worth watching. But from that linked presentation, they expect Sipwitch to update the firewall rules in such access. Good luck with that.",1305417151

Otherwise, I get the impression that the site was last updated in 2009.</i><p>I have considered making the blog the main site and the main site an ""archive"", because the information there is mostly pretty outdated but makes for a good intro/overview.  It would involve a lot of work and I'm not sure how to tackle some of the technical issues.<p>Any idea how I could easily make the blog more visible?<p><i>I'd write a one paragraph summary of who you are and what you're trying to accomplish, the ""elevator pitch"" if you will.

This past year has been very hard in terms of my physical healing process.  It's been enormously eventful (like I have had way too many Saturdays where I threw up all day).  There are plans to redo the main page, there really are.  But I really don't want to put the focus on me (re your comment about explaining ""who I am"").  I have struggled a lot with the fact that information on the site is so personal -- not because I care about sharing such info (I spent years in therapy for sexual abuse endured as a child and both my therapists were ministers -- I'm perfectly comfortable blathering on about crap that makes other people desperately want to tape my mouth shut) but because of the negative fall-out that occurs and that it takes the spotlight off the information per se, which is where I want it to be.  So I wrestle a lot with that and I very much want to work on making the site more about ""this is good info and helped me"" and less about ""me, me, me"", which just causes all kinds of problems in all kinds of ways.<p><i>I'd consider coming up with a short timeline - as a new visitor, I might be interested in quickly knowing things like how far along you are in your journey.

But you can't separate this dramatic piece of my life experience from who I am and I don't think it's possible for me to entirely walk away from it.  I think if I shut down the site and made a fortune doing something else entirely, then years down the road reporters would hound me for info on how I got well. I would rather just leave the site up and say ""here's that info -- now back on topic, it's so not that interesting, thanks"".  As I noted elsewhere, the site grew out of an off-the-cuff remark I made on an email list I belonged to and the strong reactions people had to the information I casually commented on as a normal part of my everyday existence (a list, btw, that had nothing to do with health issues at all).",1305417046

Whether that's a capacitor holding or not holding a charge, of a bit of spinning iron oxide with a measurable magnetic orientation - any actual ""bit"" is made up of many atoms, and any ordered collection of bits requires many more atoms to hold them in their ordered arrangement (and many more atoms to provide the capability of reading this bits).<p>A terabyte is 2^40 or ~10^12 bits.

I checked Best Buy and the best they could do was something like $36 for the length I wanted.<p>I then found that I could buy THE SAME cable from MacMall for $6. Not a generic brand--the exact brand name cable. Same manufacturer's part number and everything. And I could get overnight FedEx with Saturday delivery by 10 AM for $10.

Go to some place like monoprice.com, and give yourself a budget of, say, 75% of what one long cable would cost you at best buy. Use that budget to order a variety of cables. For example, for USB, for the cost of one 10 or 12 foot Best Buy cable, you could get 2 or 3 long USB cables from monoprice, 2 or 3 six footers, and a handful of 2 or 3 footers. Do that now. No rush, so use the cheapest shipping.<p>Now you've got a stock of cables, and as you use them you can replenish your stock at your leisure.

I posit that you don&#x27;t have experience with everyone who&#x27;s lost money on kickstarter and uttered that particular phrase.  And not knowing the sample size of your experience, I don&#x27;t really trust your opinion on people, except that some are oblivious and some are jerks.  Some are.  People&#x27;s oblivion does not stun me anymore.  I don&#x27;t expect drivers to stay on the road.  People do things that are terrible for their health, and can generally be counted on to make objectively bad decisions, especially my mother.  But the thing is, if you get all the human souls in a room, and get them to guess how much a mountain weighs, the mean average is consistently closer than any individual guess.  So I guess some people&#x27;s idiocy is a counterbalance to the wise people.  I hope I&#x27;ve filled your heart with hope just a little bit.",1405047511

8018653,comment,8004812,8016645,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> Netflix and YouTube</i><p>And multiplayer online games, and others that have been mentioned in this thread, and... The basic error you are making here is to think that the set of applications with these bandwidth requirements is small and easily predictable. It isn&#x27;t. And it will get less and less so as time goes on.<p><i>> Why should people who don&#x27;t use Netflix and YouTube pay for the upgrades that help only users who make use of these things?</i><p>They shouldn&#x27;t, and they aren&#x27;t. They just buy a cheaper, lower bandwidth Internet plan from their ISP. They&#x27;re doing that already--certainly I am. I don&#x27;t want or need Netflix so I don&#x27;t pay Comcast for that level of bandwidth.<p>If your reply is that that money still ends up going to pay for network upgrades that I don&#x27;t need, first of all, if that were really true, Comcast wouldn&#x27;t have had to try to charge Netflix for the privilege of faster connections, because, as I said before, they would have actually been using the monopoly rents they&#x27;ve been extracting for the purpose for which they were intended--network upgrades to keep pace with demand.<p>But more importantly, network upgrades that increase aggregate bandwidth benefit everybody, not just Netflix or Youtube users. Except for the &quot;last mile&quot; connection to each individual house (which is <i>not</i> affected by deals like the Comcast-Netflix deal), everybody&#x27;s traffic travels over the same network, and network upgrades speed up all that traffic. Which is precisely what net neutrality is trying to <i>preserve</i>, and what Comcast charging Netflix for faster connections does <i>not</i> preserve.<p>In other words, your claim that passing the costs on to users will make everyone pay for Netflix will only come true <i>if</i> we allow ISPs to privilege Netflix traffic over other traffic. Otherwise everyone is just paying for increased aggregate bandwidth from which everyone benefits. And if everyone pays just for the bandwidth they need, what&#x27;s the problem? Everyone then contributes their fair share to keeping up the network that everyone uses.",1405047269

I don&#x27;t find the devs attitude lazy unless they actually come out and say screw it we aren&#x27;t going to both to support Windows.<p>And this attitude being displayed toward Microsoft is just lazy (and very likely the province of the young), because while they did give us a crappy browser and Webforms for way too long, and they are fun to poke fun at, they&#x27;ve done more than most companies to push both the computer revolution and the Internet as a whole forward to what it is today.

8018648,comment,8015991,8016960,1,0,mbesto,,,"> <i>Likewise, music has been around forever, but the chances of someone like Lorde, a 16 year old from New Zealand, seeing such success was much less likely before the Internet democratized music for listeners and creators alike.</i><p>You know, I see this argument a lot and I&#x27;m not buying it. To paraphrase Nate Silver in &quot;The Signal and the Noise&quot;: just because the internet provides an exponential amount of information to the public doesn&#x27;t mean everyone is smarter, because with every increase in total information there is an increase in bad information. The solution is basically better curation. Curation, in today&#x27;s world, is still run by individuals and people in positions of power. Music, just like information, has seen an explosion in data points since the advent of the internet. All of this becomes democratized until it doesn&#x27;t. In other words - these markets go from non-democratized (the CD world), to democratized (YouTube), and the back again (Spotify/Rdio). Cheaper access to art creation only means the market is more saturation. The signal to noise ratio (i.e. chance) stays the same, it just means a lot more noise exists.",1405047150

8018631,comment,8016055,8016055,1,0,Athens,,,"The real problem is the ownership of the physical lines that interconnect everything. The high cost and the limited right of way access prevents duplication of physical networks leaving one company in ownership thus control and this is a monopoly. This is why most North American cities (Canada and the United States) have one cable company and one phone company in each region. Services from competitors and small companies just access, use and resell from the single company in the region. In BC for Example you have Shaw and Telus. Bell, Videotron, Rogers rents access over the Telus Network in most cases.<p>What is really needed is to separate the physical network form the service provider. We need a Provincially and State owned network or county or city owned networks with one mandate only. Provide a physical network and charge a price to maintain and grow it. owners of homes and businesses and other buildings would pay for the last mile connection to the network and own that last mile connection. Companies like Bell, Rogers, and dozens upon dozens of small companies offering service be it phone or internet or TV can plug hardware into the network and provide such services. Both the consumer and the ISP pay a network access fee that pays for the network. But this puts every one on equal footing because its the same fee. the physical network can&#x27;t throttle or control or manipulate any of the content. Would be easy for small companies to expand by adding hardware into data center locations all over the network. Would allow consumers to buy and plug in equipment to allow for point to point VPN connections between family members at a fair price.<p>It is the only way to solve this issue. I would suggest the same be done with the Cell Phone networks. The Cities and Provinces and States own the towers using all the frequencies and they charge a access fee to the subscriber and phone provider to manage and expand the network. Any company could start up a cell service and compete head to head. As long as the core infrastructure is owned by one entity that has its own motives on how to use it, it will always be a monopoly situation and thats bad for business and consumers and innovation. Take the expensive part out of the puzzle and make it a public owned resource let the ISP and companies fight for customers on equal footing.",1405046719

[emphasis mine]<p>Hey now, &quot;Le Langage Caml&quot; might be in French, and it might be pretty dated at this point, but it&#x27;s a solid introduction to functional programming and Caml (note the lack of &quot;O&quot; -- like I said, it&#x27;s pretty dated).<p>One of the things I like about it is that it it has 5 chapters dedicated to walking through some pretty complicated examples (following 11 chapters giving a tutorial introduction to Caml).  With many programming books the examples are so simple that it&#x27;s hard to see how they all fit together, but Weis and Leroy do an outstanding job of showing how interesting programs would be written in Caml:  an interpreter for a little logic language, a file compression/decompression utility, an emulator and assembler for a RISC processor, a &quot;mini-Pascal&quot; compiler targeting said processor, and a regular expression search utility (à la grep).  It doesn&#x27;t just show the code for these programs, but it walks you through building it, from design(!) all the way to the finished product, explaining every little bit in detail.  I wish more programming books did this kind of thing!<p>Like &quot;Real World OCaml&quot;, it covers a bit of the runtime -- it&#x27;s the Caml Light runtime rather than the OCaml runtime, but some of the discussion applies equally to OCaml as well.<p>Lastly, it has a style that I feel is lacking in many programming books:  the authors are careful to use rather precise phrasing.  I think this is good because it helps to eliminate a lot of ambiguous or misleading text.<p>So sure, advise against it for people who don&#x27;t understand French.  For people who do understand French (even a little -- it&#x27;s mostly technical terms), &quot;Le Langage Caml&quot; is an excellent book.",1405045293

8018534,comment,8013855,8014676,1,0,waps,,,"Asking lefties to side with Israel isn&#x27;t going to work for several reasons, but the main ones are :<p>1) Israel started out as a &quot;free&quot; communist state (the Kibbutzim system) and over a few decades the people en masse freely abandoned it to create what pretty much is the cutthroat almost purely capitalist society that it is today.<p>It is the poster child for the idea that voluntary socialism doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s existence at this point is an offence to the ideas that guide the international leftist movements.<p>Israel&#x27;s evolution is the reason that socialists worldwide aren&#x27;t satisfied to create the option for people to be socialist, but want to have the state force socialism on everyone.<p>The fun thing is, there is one single thing islam and the west agree on, and that&#x27;s cutthroat capitalism. In fact, islam&#x27;s sharia is significantly more cutthroat than western capitalism, including for example slavery. You&#x27;d think lefties would have a huge problem with an extreme capitalist party. Hell, you&#x27;d think Americans would have more problems with religions pushing slavery.<p>2) Israel creates a hard-to-deny &quot;western ideology&quot; idea of superiority (not that Israel is all that western). Compare any property of Israel. Without resources, without much area, without much means it has achieved so much success it&#x27;s not funny :<p>(a) a democratic state, surrounded by dictatorships (Egypt and Saudi)<p>(b) large, functional cities with an actual economy in that region (meaning not just foreign contractors drilling for oil and slaves, or just a sea of people wholly dependant on foreign food aid)<p>(c) the population actually has decent lives<p>(d) freedom of religion (maybe this ought to be higher up the list). Actual significant, prosperous pockets of pretty much every religion.<p>(e) can actually survive without external sponsorship (e.g. the US pays more to a Gaza inhabitant than it pays to an unemployed person inside the United States ... that&#x27;s the worst example, of course, but the US pays per-capita recurring amounts for every person in every country bordering Israel except Syria and Lebanon (where it&#x27;s mostly done by other states).<p>3) Israel is an easy scapegoat for the very bad relations between the west and islam. What everyone forgets is that there has only ever been open war between the west and islam for ~1400 years, and then low-level terrorist/insurgent warfare in the 20th century that&#x27;s easier to ignore.<p>Israel is obviously not the cause of this conflict, but it combines this unfortunate position for both parties :<p>(a) for muslims it&#x27;s the ultimate offence, an open, country-sized, big font note on every map saying &quot;western freedom-of-religion culture is superior to islam !&quot;. A western state controlling one of the &quot;holy&quot; cities of islam. The central &quot;reason&quot; for islam is that allah promises muslims will conquer the world. Well, they can&#x27;t even conquer Jerusalem ... They literally are unable to impose sharia law on one of the places it was created.<p>Needless to say, muslims give zero consideration to the fact that it&#x27;s also a holy city of Judaism and Christianity.<p>The crime of Israel, in the eyes of moslems, is not the victims it&#x27;s defensive campaigns caused, it&#x27;s not the lost territory, it&#x27;s is that it shows you can resist islam, right in the middle of it&#x27;s heartland.<p>Think of it like if there was a successful communist mini-state controlling a few neighbourhoods of Washington DC, that the US constantly, unsuccessfully, tries to sabotage using any and all means. That&#x27;s how Israel appears to middle eastern moslems.<p>(b) for western states it&#x27;s the demonstration of what is needed to live with moslem neighbors. That the situation is effectively unchanged from the 19th century : the only way to survive moslem neighbors is to constantly be ready to start a military campaign at the drop of a hat.<p>The moslem way of fighting makes following human rights, the separation of civilians and soldiers, nonsense. Islam dictates that every moslem is a soldier, or has to contribute to the war on &quot;dar al harb&quot;, meaning they have to contribute to fighting some non-muslims. The big problem this causes is that moslem soldiers pose as civilians (because that&#x27;s how &quot;the prophet&quot; fought), then suddenly take out weapons in a crowded marketplace and start fighting.<p>Contrast the Christian (meaning canon law) way of fighting is : you send an envoy to the enemy, stating &quot;date such-and-such, we fight here-and-here, we will not touch your forces in area A, you will not touch our forces in area B, and whoever wins gets to take city X&quot;, this is negotiated until both parties agree and then hostilities open. Surprise attacks against civilians, raids and insurgent attacks, moslems&#x27; basic strategy (whether you&#x27;re talking about the prophet&#x27;s wars or recent stuff), is utterly out of the question and considered a moral abomination.<p>Obviously canon law is about as successful regulating war as sharia law was, or any other law really, once the guns start blasting, but it generally does govern the start of conflicts. The best example of &quot;but the law says&quot; versus warfare in my mind is the Spartacus campaign in the Roman Empire. That&#x27;s a story that you start reading very hopeful, everyone starting with good intentions, everyone out to improve everyone&#x27;s life and everyone agreeing to abide by a legal system (even if that legal system is somewhat ...) and you are literally terrified at the end. It doesn&#x27;t happen because one side behaves badly (they do behave badly, of course, just for good reasons). Everything that happens is sort-of reasonable given the situation, yet it ends in a torture massacre, and a global repeal of some freedoms in the Roman Empire.<p>This means that military bases are the central feature of every moslem town, and everyone is a soldier. It means schools, mosques, shops and rocket launching facilities are one and the same thing. (Mosque, incidentally, translates to &quot;fortress&quot;. Historically mosques were fortresses first, and had several other functions. In historical mosques you will find markets, slave markets (recognizable by the fashion-show like podia), weapons inventory, food inventory, stables, schools, soldier&#x27;s bunk rooms, walls, siege weapons, ... The prayer room (masjid, not mosque. There do exist masjids that aren&#x27;t mosques, mostly in non-sunni brands of islam).<p>Western states do not want to get into this fight, and Israel is a constant reminder that if one side in a conflict decides you&#x27;re in a fight, then you&#x27;re in a fight. If one side decides to destroy some legal right, there is a massive cost on the other side to maintain it. Freedom of religion, civilian versus military separation, economic freedom, freedom of movement, immigration, ... all of these cannot be sustained in a real conflict. The west simply hasn&#x27;t gotten in a real conflict for more than a generation, so nobody seems to remember what happened to legal rights in America during WWII.<p>In strategic reality, Israel is a lightning rod : it&#x27;s getting attacked by moslems, who would otherwise be attacking other things (they have for 1500 years, never stopped). In public opinion, it&#x27;s a stark and public reminder that there has never been even a single decade of peace with the moslem world, there have only been periods where muslims were utterly defeated in most regions, with conflicts limited to border regions. It&#x27;s a reminder because it&#x27;s an offence to moslems and so moslems won&#x27;t stop attracting attention to it, where the conflicts islam gets into everywhere else, Sudan, Mali, China, Pakistan, India, Azerbajan, Iran, Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Zanzibar, Kenia, Somalia, ... sort of fade into the background.<p>What people don&#x27;t realize is the stakes of this conflict : if the conflict escalates (moslems don&#x27;t have to win to achieve this) much of the 20th century social advances will have to be at least temporarily reversed. Since the alternative is destruction, they will be, because when it comes right down to it, survival and freedom from raids is more important than pretty much anything else, including things like due process, democracy, ... There is no way islam&#x27;s strategy can work, but it can destroy a lot before it is defeated. Sadly, if the conflict escalates, some of these rights will be lost for a long time.",1405044634

Finally the assessment of the basic PHP knowledge such as using PDO to connect MYSQL had already be made on paper test so there was no point repeating this there.<p>- The JS is certainly not perfect, game.js could use some refactoring, but my intent was not to make a production ready app but to show that I know how to write proper and maintainable vanilla JS. Given more time I would have addressed those details (which BTW are not the real issue in that code). \nAlso you&#x27;ll notice that I chose NOT to use a framework there as it was not needed. Again this was an informed decision.<p>- Sudo: I was worried that whom ever would try to install the app bumped into permission issues so I tried to make easier to install.

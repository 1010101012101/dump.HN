7026111,comment,7021962,7025101,7,0,JackC,,,"Ah hah! I actually think that HiDPI mode and retina mode are the same thing, but the issue you&#x27;re getting at is that OS X doesn&#x27;t yet have drivers for external 4K monitors that support HiDPI mode.[1]<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on: on a retina MBP, the screen basically always runs in HiDPI mode. That means everything is rendered twice as large as it should be, for a screen twice as large as the virtual resolution you want, and then scaled down to native resolution. Icons that would be 32px are 64px, fonts that would be 12pt are 24pt, etc., and then they&#x27;re shrunk down to their proper size.<p>This is really cool because it lets us run at _any_ resolution between 1x and 2x with minimal loss of quality, even though apps are only coded to run at one of the two extremes.<p>So, say I have a 2880x1800px screen on my rMBP, but I want a virtual extra-sharp 1920x1200px screen. I render the screen twice the size I want it (3840x2400) in HiDPI mode where everything is twice as large as it should be, and then I scale it _down_ in the graphics card to my native resolution of 2880x1800. This technique allows me to pick _any_ resolution between 1x (2880x1800) and 2x (1440x900) and have it look pretty good, because I&#x27;m only scaling down to my native resolution rather than up. Some stops along the way are nicer than others, and 1440x900 looks the best because it requires no scaling at all, but I have lots of options along the way that look good.<p>The first thing you need for this to work is, obviously, for your apps to know how to render at 1x or 2x. 95% of Mac apps seem to be there by now. (The ones that aren&#x27;t fixed still work fine -- they just look obviously low-resolution because they&#x27;ve been scaled up and back down.)<p>Then you need your graphics card to be capable of rendering a screen with twice the virtual resolution you want, and scaling it down to your native resolution in realtime. That&#x27;s a serious amount of processing, and apparently it&#x27;s not supported so well yet for external 4K monitors. But importantly, it&#x27;s something that only has to be solved at the driver level -- the OS and apps are already there.<p>[1] See <a href""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013/1"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013/...</a> and search for &quot;HiDPI.&quot;",1389211197

Since promotions are merit-based, and due to the stack-ranking employed by Amazon to rank the enggs, things only get diff for &#x27;B&#x27; candidates.&quot;<p>This is probably completely wrong , unless all of your B candidates are being hired at very low levels only, and none of them ever get to participate in the promotion process.<p>Additionally, most tech companies are really bad at dealing with low performers in general (they tend to stay around too long).<p>In any case, my sources are completely empirical, having managed large numbers of people at a number of tech companies (and thus watching things like what happens to B candidates during cross-organization score calibrations, etc), as well as mentoring and helping managers with some of these issues.<p>I&#x27;d love to be wrong, but I have yet to see a company where the hiring of B candidates did not have <i>significantly</i> more impact that was expected.",1389211114

If the car behind you is a robot, it will come to a stop at 5cm from your car.<p>Unless, of course, the manual drivers counteract by driving more dangerously. Why stop for a red traffic light if all other cars are driven by computer? Can you try and get an autonomous car to drive into a ditch by moving your car very close to it?<p>I think there will have to be laws governing such behavior (&#x27;harassment of an autonomous vehicle&#x27;), with video cameras in the autonomous vehicles providing the evidence.<p>That also is a reason that I think driverless cars will not work everywhere for quite a number of years. In the typical old city in Western Europe, an automated car will have to negotiate with pedestrians and cyclists for room. Once the pedestrians know that a car will brake if &#x27;challenged&#x27;, they will change their behavior.

7026094,comment,7023650,7025275,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"High school education in the US typically requires a 1 <i>semester</i> economics course, at most. A one semester or one year government/civics course. Two years of history (US and World, the latter typically being very eurocentric). In the sciences, college bound students will have taken (usually) one year each of biology, chemistry and physics. On the math front they&#x27;ll have gone through trigonometry, perhaps pre-calculus. For foreign languages they&#x27;ll have usually taken two or three years of some language (almost universally available: French, Spanish; common: German; some regions or schools will have more options available). For literature (also known as language arts or English) they&#x27;ll usually have taken three or four years. The first is often a refresher on composition, with reading really being intended only to provide material for discussion and writing assignments. The second and third courses are often region/time specific (American Lit, British Lit, World Lit from 300AD-800AD), the fourth (again, for college bound students) will involve more complex novels and writing assignments.<p>Knowledge of specific economists is not the norm in the basic college prep curriculum in the US. Students in the IB program (relatively rare, available in major cities so the majority don&#x27;t have the option) or the AP program will have studied the subjects to a greater depth. At least equivalent to freshman/sophomore college courses in the subject.<p>For a bachelors degree the students will apply to schools and get in based on: GPA, SAT/ACT scores, extracurricular activities, interview (not used for the average university), and essays. Some schools put all freshmen into the same pot and require them to apply to their major after their freshman year. In that case, it&#x27;d be similar to your &quot;Don&#x27;t know Keynes? Probably won&#x27;t get an offer.&quot; situation. However, that&#x27;s also not the norm. And once at the school the students can usually change major with ease.",1389211009

First of all, I don&#x27;t think sweet.js macros can implement a full type system like TypeScript has which can load type definitions from other files, do type inference and support interface definitions.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s difficult to get a community around a single type system. Thirdly, it&#x27;s difficult to get IDEs to support these sweet.js macro type systems.<p>The fact is, a sweet.js macro type system which is widely in use and supports everything TypeScript has and is supported by many IDEs doesn&#x27;t support, and is unlikely in my opinion, if not technically impossible. In theory it might work.<p>If you compile TypeScript and then call it using JavaScript with the wrong type the code will misbehave. It&#x27;s a downside, true, but a dynamic type checking system written in JavaScript would be too costly.

7026008,comment,7022742,7022742,6,0,zeidrich,,,"1: A little pain is good for you.<p>The article states that &quot;constructive, even painful feedback&quot; is necessary.  It conjures an idea of being hurtful to students.  That&#x27;s not the truth though.  It means giving uncompromising honest feedback. When something is incorrect, it is stated as being incorrect, and a student can learn.  That might be painful to the student&#x27;s ego to hear that they were wrong, and is something we might tiptoe around now, but it&#x27;s not being cruel, in fact it&#x27;s being respectful to the student.  It&#x27;s not the pain that&#x27;s good for you, it&#x27;s the honest and constructive feedback, and if you feel some pain in hearing that, deal with it.  But show me a study that shows that going around calling your students idiots who will never make anything of themselves will help them because it&#x27;s painful and I will be surprised.  In response, pain isn&#x27;t good for you, honest evaluation is good for you, and you might feel pain when you hear it.<p>2. Drill, baby drill.  The article mentions drills, but the real takeaway from the article is memorization.  I&#x27;m in favor of memorization in terms of learning, because it allows you to conjure up simple methods without having to go through a process.  When I want to know what 8<i>7 is, I know it&#x27;s 56, I don&#x27;t have to count on my fingers. When I need to think about what 82</i>70 is, I know it&#x27;s 5740 because I know 8<i>7 and 7</i>2 off the top of my head.  That said, drills in school aren&#x27;t necessarily the most effective way to memorize something.  Many memory training things use very different methods, and we don&#x27;t even try to teach our children with those methods.  If we recognize that it&#x27;s commitment to memory that is important and not drills, we could be more effective.<p>3. Failure is an option.  This I absolutely agree with.  But part of the problem we have is that we have institutionalized the fear of failure.  You say that failure is a good thing, but the article pushes for antiquated systems where a failure can have all sorts of permanent social ramifications.  From primary school where a student gets held back, to secondary school where grades determine your choice of post-secondary education, to university where a poor GPA can ruin your options.  We rarely get an opportunity to learn from these mistakes without judgment. If a teacher allowed you to retake a test until you understood the material, that would allow failure to be an option, but we concern ourselves with the logistical problems of having students at different points in the curriculum.  So we are afraid that if we fail we will not keep up, and once we stop keeping up, there&#x27;s little point in trying any more.  The class marches on, and even if we learn the things we failed the first time around, that test is already taken.<p>4. Strict vs. nice is again honest vs. dishonest.  A strict teacher says &quot;Do this assignment by this date and I will grade it for you.&quot; Then they accept the assignment on that date and grade it. A student who is late completing the assignment asks the strict teacher to submit it late, and the strict teacher says no.  The &quot;nice&quot; teacher will say yes. The strict teacher was honest and forthright in their request.  The nice teacher wasn&#x27;t.  When you&#x27;re dealing with someone who honors their word, it&#x27;s easy to know what is expected, and it&#x27;s easy to respect them.  When you&#x27;re dealing with the nice teacher, you&#x27;re a bit uncomfortable, why did you do the assignment on time when Jimmy handed his in late and didn&#x27;t have anything happen?  Then next time when you have an assignment due, you aren&#x27;t sure if you have given your best work, (and you&#x27;re afraid of failure), but you think maybe the nice teacher will let you hand it in late.  You wait to finish it until it&#x27;s late, and then you&#x27;re uncertain whether the teacher will still accept it, and eventually it just goes unsubmitted altogether.  With the strict teacher, you know they will only accept it tomorrow, so you do what you can. Or you don&#x27;t.  Either way, you know the consequences.<p>But what that gets twisted into is an idea that a strict teacher has to be dishonest, and tell the students they are worse than they are.  That they have to hurt them to make them feel better.  Again, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the hurt that helps, but the honesty and integrity.<p>The article gives an anecdote about coddling a child in first and second grade vs. a third grade teacher that tells them to get to work.  This isn&#x27;t really a matter of strictness the way the rest of the point is.  It also has not a lot to do with learning in the traditional sense, but more of learning in a social sense.  The big takeaway in this is still integrity.  When you make a reasonable request to the class, and a child in the class has an issue with it, do you modify that request?  You you make things lighter for them.  If you do, you&#x27;re undermining your own integrity.  You&#x27;re saying &quot;What I asked you to do wasn&#x27;t important, so if you have a problem with it, you can make me change it.&quot;  It&#x27;s hard to hit a moving target like that.<p>5. Creativity can be learned.\nCreativity is only as useful as the student&#x27;s ability to express it. A problem with this model is that an excellent student doesn&#x27;t have an opportunity to demonstrate any special talent.  Neither do they have much ability to do so in the current system.  Does that mean that it&#x27;s better to regress to a point of rapping knuckles with yardsticks and ineffective drills?<p>6. Grit trumps talent.\n&quot;Grit&quot; is a person&#x27;s ability to continue to work consistently.  When a person gives up on something, it&#x27;s often because attempting to continue working on it causes unbearable stress, or there&#x27;s an absolute indifference to it.  The stress is going to come from a fear of judgment from failure.  Something is hard, that means we&#x27;re recognizing that we might make a mistake, that we don&#x27;t understand it fully and if we ask for help or show something incorrectly we will be ridiculed.  This means we barely dip our toes into things we struggle with, and don&#x27;t get interested. How will moving to a culture of fear and pain teach students to be optimistic?<p>7. Praise makes you weak. \nYes, praise in general is pretty pointless. It&#x27;s vapid and hurtful, because it makes students seek more praise.  Instead, if a student is left alone, they&#x27;re going to feel intrinsic motivation from the actual learning.  There&#x27;s an element of overjustification effect that takes place.<p>That said, the absence of praise doesn&#x27;t mean that a culture of insults and diminuation should take its place<p>8.  Stress makes us strong\nNot really.  I just strictly disagree with that.  Dealing with stress makes you strong as you learn to deal with it.  Being under stress is harmful. Being put into a stressful class will not make you strong because you can&#x27;t do anything about it.  Sort of the difference between a good exercise regimen where you damage your muscles and then let them heal, and a situation where you&#x27;re constantly overstressing them and never have an opportunity to have a break.  One will build strength, the other can cause long-term damage.<p>The Mr. K in the article is finally described as cold, unyielding and kind of scary.  These are not bad qualities.  Being Cold just means he&#x27;s not likely to yield to an emotional request, unyielding indicates he&#x27;s going to stand by his word.  Like I mentioned earlier, honesty and integrity is a good thing, and he embodies these characteristics.  Being scary is a bit of a wild card, it means he&#x27;s causing anxiety in the students, that&#x27;s probably not great for performance, but it probably leads them to not question his requests, which just leads to a stronger understanding of his expectation.<p>The Mr. K character in the story doesn&#x27;t embody the sort of things that the individual points seem to.<p>You can be a kind and fair teacher, you don&#x27;t have to lose your temper, you don&#x27;t have to yell, you don&#x27;t have to tell your students their work is terrible when it&#x27;s average. You don&#x27;t have to embarrass them in front of their peers.<p>But you will be more effective if you are honest, trustworthy, and challenge your students to excel.  If you structure your class so that the student is graded based on how well they know the subject rather than how few times they have made mistakes.  If you provide the resources that a student needs to improve themselves when they&#x27;ve fallen behind the pack, and if you provide the resources that a student needs when they&#x27;ve excelled beyond the pack.",1389210354

There are some things we do know, if only anecdotally (maybe there&#x27;s been some research on the subject – I don&#x27;t know). We do know that C++ was a real boon when it first garnered wide appeal, but that very quickly large teams began to curtail the use of some of its more advanced features because of that reason. We also know that people have been writing much larger projects in Java (and possibly C#) than in any other language in history, certainly relative to the effort invested (there might have been larger C++ projects). Some of it just seems intuitive (though may not be the actual case). The problem is that it&#x27;s hard to gather data because the languages adopting this view are the ones that are most popular, which helps them get selected for large projects to begin with. But we might have more data soon. I think JavaScript is the first &quot;magic encouraged&quot; language that will be used in multi MLOC projects. Ruby is more &quot;magical&quot; but doesn&#x27;t seem to be favored by large teams working on large projects. So we might know more soon.<p>Personally, though, I think that&#x27;s the wrong issue. Whatever extra productivity is gained by language magic, we&#x27;re not talking orders of magnitude here. Usually it&#x27;s mostly about developer enjoyment, lack of annoying boilerplate etc..

7025889,story,,,55,90,niallpaterson,"Ask HN: Sick of your bank? Want to build a open source, non-profit, online bank?",,"Hey there, I&#x27;m Irish, and here our banks are shady and private. The government owns most of them (through bailouts) yet still there&#x27;s little to no transparency - they act as the please, grabbing as much profit off their customers as possible. Most people here hate their bank and would gladly move to a half decent alternative, but of course there is none. It&#x27;s identical in most countries nowadays, including the US. I think we can all agree that fundamentally, the finance industry is backward, greedy and corrupt. It needs to change.<p>Here&#x27;s the idea: An open source, upfront, transparant and <i>humane</i> bank driven not by profit but by the passion to simply create a bank that people like and enjoy using.<p>A few key ideas or keystones might include:<p><pre><code>    * Transparant/Open Source\n    * Non Profit\n    * Great Customer Support\n    * Few and fair fees\n    * Great User Experience\n    * Mobile First (cliche I know..)\n    * Open API\n\n  \n</code></pre>\nThis wouldn&#x27;t just be a projects for fellow developers. We&#x27;d need designers, lawyers, and people involved in banks who are dissatisfied at the current status quo (after all we&#x27;ll need a partner bank in every country we want to operate in to avoid logistical nightmares). I really think it could be a project anyone could help out in - Think of it as a generation coming together to drag one of the biggest industries in the world into the 21st century.<p>By partnering with a local bank in each country, it would cut out a lot of issue logistically, making the project a lot easier to implement than just building a new bank from the ground up.<p>Any thoughts?<p>By the way, my email address is npaterson1 [at] gmail [dot] com if you&#x27;re interested/want to know more :)\nNiall<p>P.S Regarding Credit Unions, I can see why people are bringing them up but mcuy issue with them is that they don&#x27;t offer stuff like checking accounts, atms etc, aren&#x27;t really open that much, are exceptionally slow at allowing you withdraw and are completely offline. That&#x27;s just my experience, but I don&#x27;t think you could actually <i>bank</i> with a credit union, which is what I&#x27;m trying to get at.<p>P.P.S I think if you were to look at the three things I mentioned - online, non profit and open source, non profit is the one I think is least differentiable if that makes any sense. I think an online open source bank is the real innovative part, not the non profit part.<p>EDIT: A lot of people are asking something along the lines of &#x27;well this works when it comes to banking, what else is there to it?&#x27;. I think banking is a really really backward system, there&#x27;s so much you could do, simple tiny things that would make experiences so much more pleasant. Here&#x27;s an example: Imagine if your bank account had a profile, almost like a social network, and you could go to someone else&#x27;s profile and quickly see recent transactions you&#x27;ve had with them. I&#x27;m not thinking of something like a credit union, rather something quite different, and I really feel there&#x27;s lots more that can be done with banking from a tech pov. I don&#x27;t get why we have to assume banking is as advanced as it can be, it&#x27;s clearly not.",1389209472

If you&#x27;re on a leisurely ride through the country or are looking for a place with no address, you can&#x27;t use automated navigation. So disabling it would be a necessity for a variety of driving purposes. As an aside, motorsport enthusiasts would be up in arms if they had to pay a premium just to be able to drive their expensive sports sedan the way they want on a closed track.<p>What will probably happen is a black box will record if the car was in automated mode when a crash occurs. If it was driving itself, the manufacturer will probably be at fault and forced to pay the insurance company. If you were driving it, the standard rules apply.<p>I have to say though, automated drifting is really depressing. I used to drive a Toyota MR2, which is an ass-heavy car that was very susceptible to snap oversteer. Unlike most other cars, if you felt like the car&#x27;s rear end was about to slide out of control, you had to PUNCH the gas to get traction back.

It&#x27;s the most exciting thing i&#x27;ve ever experienced in a car (even more than sitting in on hot laps with an indy driver in a Lexus IS-F), and I would never get to experience it with automated driving.<p>As for non-drifting, automated driving is definitely an amazing and useful feature.

I have been doing this sort of thing for ~15 years which doesn&#x27;t make me right, just experienced. The problem with most of those languages and frameworks is that as soon as you need something outside of that framework or core language, it is uncommon that the library is setup for async I/O, streaming, etc. You end up writing a lot of wrapper and/or glue code to string everything together. Or worse you find an amazing library, but because of its design it is difficult to make it do what you want so you resort to reinventing the wheel albeit poorly. Because of the nature of Node and its module ecosystem, much of that problem is solved.<p>It isn&#x27;t about using Node because it is cool or I like Javascript (which I hate BTW). It is about accomplishing my goal of an efficient HTTP API server much more quickly with Node than any of the other languages/frameworks that have come before.

Consciousness does require memory. It is not possible to observe, experience, or process without memory, all of which are required for the integration of consciousness. Even to perceive requires memory, since it requires the integration, filtering, and processing of large amounts data into consistent perception and a conscious interpretation thereof - none of which is instantaneous and all of which takes time, requiring memory.",1389208215

A standard which, by the way, was developed by not one but two international standards bodies, the proceedings of which I can view online (<a href""http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meeting"" rel""nofollo"">http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/meetings</a>).<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve been in this for too long, but when I started, codecs like DLI were the norm rather than the exception. The top competitors at the time were Sorenson, On2 (VPx), RealNetworks, and Microsoft, and MPEG-4 had barely trickled out of the demo boxes in the form of a cracked copy of a MS draft implementation that ended in &quot;;-)&quot;. Patent dangers were well known thanks to Fraunhofer&#x27;s actions against LAME, but since they didn&#x27;t extend to Europe where much open source codec development occurred, and since they were (before GPLv3) largely within a separate legal sphere from copyright issues, and since it had long been folk wisdom that doing video compression without stepping on someone&#x27;s patent was impossible, they were seen as little more than an unavoidable detail (here&#x27;s some source code, compile it yourself in America.) It was none other than H.264 (ostensibly with a lot of help from x264) that put an end to this era.<p>So when I see folks putting the MPEG Licensing Authority (unaffiliated with ISO and MPEG, by the way) on a pedestal, and I see it a lot, and using it as an excuse to further technologically inferior codecs which are themselves (unlike MPEG standards) technically proprietary, I have a hard time reconciling the thought process. And to bring it up in response to a comparison against something like DLI?

You do typically have two guys and you really need two for safety as sometimes you need human eyes looking out both windows at once (freight trains have poor visibility compared to trucks).<p>A freight train with one dude strikes me as unlikely.  The few single person trains out there have excellent visibility for the one driver.  So you&#x27;d have an interesting capital expense if you tried that with freight trains.  I do know some small switcher locos run single person but thats in a barb-wired switchyard well away from the general public.  So you&#x27;d &quot;have to&quot; eliminate all grade crossings or something, another big expense.",1389207638

Truth be told, I had a terrible instructor -- he could code, but he couldn&#x27;t teach very well. One caveat is that I already knew HTML and CSS before entering.<p>I appreciated that they try their damnedest to hook people up with jobs if they want one. The instructor you wind up with might just be the most important puzzle piece. People in previous classes with better instructors are now in jobs making 70-110k in NYC. I landed a job at an education startup and they offered me 62k.<p>A friend of mine who entered the bootcamp a few months ago, based on my experiences, landed a job paying 50k. We both admitted that there wasn&#x27;t much actual coding going on, though -- my job was working with Puppet configs and building out new instances of cookie-cutter websites. His was mainly messing around on the front-end and putting together email templates.<p>I&#x27;d do it over again if I could. It did teach me a whole lot, and got me started on a junior path, but there is no question that most of us need a bit more experience and work before really being able to call ourselves junior devs. As the previous commenter said, a lot of the knowledge they impart is skin-deep -- until you run with it and make projects with it.

My opinion is: Android should <i>not</i> adopt Scala as one of its primary languages.<p>I think a platform&#x27;s primary language should be accessible. It is an unfortunate fact that the stuff that most people only know about programming using some object oriented imperative language. People find it harder to hobby with unfamiliar styles, and it is hard to find leverage within your organization to go into unknown territory. If it isn&#x27;t a popular widely known language (Java) it should at least <i>resemble</i> popular widely known languages (Swift). Give people a piece of Java or Swift code, and they can read it. Give people a piece of Scala code, and they usually cannot.<p>Scala <i>can</i> be an accessible language; its imperative syntax is really nice. But Scala <i>is not</i> an accessible language in that idiomatic real-world Scala and most of its libraries are written in a wholly unfamiliar style. Powerful, yes. People should learn it, yes. But if Scala comes to Android it will only serve to make the platform seem <i>less</i> accessible. And that&#x27;s a much bigger downside than whatever expressivity Android Java currently lacks.<p>Scala can&#x27;t even properly be a primary language in <i>parallel</i> to Java at the moment. Swift is just a better syntax for expressing idiomatic Objective C programs. Good Swift programs should look mostly like good Objective C programs with a different syntax - Swift has been made for this purpose [1]. Scala is <i>not</i> a better syntax for expressing idiomatic Java programs. Despite backwards compatibility, good Scala programs look very different to good Java programs. This means that Google cannot present them as equivalents. The Android platform APIs heavily promotes mutability which makes writing idiomatic Scala code for Android a pain in the ass. Should Google ask people to write non-idiomatic code for their new primary language, or should Google provide new APIs for their new primary language?<p>I dislike Java very much. But I think it&#x27;s a great language for Android, because everyone can do it and that makes the platform accessible. There&#x27;s only one other language I can even remotely imagine in its place, and that&#x27;s Dart. And that&#x27;s not happening either.<p>In the meantime, making Scala run on Android is perfectly doable. That is good enough for me.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m aware that this comparison doesn&#x27;t do Swift as much justice as it should.",1408376696

For instance, once we had the prototype done we started pitching it to clients, but for every 10 clients I pitched the product my co-founder would pitch to 1.

You can do what they can&#x27;t (or struggle with), and vice versa. As such, I would encourage you to find a sales person/designer/hustler, as opposed to another developer.<p>2.

The right to food implies that someone must farm it, possibly without pay.<p>Even the experts can make mistakes.<p>So rather than read what others have said on the topic, it may be better for you to simply think it out for yourself and see what you come up with.

You mean that wealthy individuals will someday be able to use technology to completely automate out the need for goods and services from others. That seems farfetched, even in a mostly automated economy. Somebody&#x27;s still got to produce, upgrade, and repair all those bots. Not to mention greet people on the phone, give haircuts, make sales, and do other jobs that benefit from a human touch.<p>Now if those bots can produce, upgrade, and repair themselves, and do jobs in a &quot;human&quot; way, that&#x27;s approaching strong AI. At that point if everything is automated top to bottom from mining raw materials to a finished product, why wouldn&#x27;t it all be free for everyone? That sounds like a post-scarcity economy to me, so it would seem pointless to hoard at that point. Backing up, the reason why I disagree with you and the video is because I think that over the long term, the more things get automated, the <i>cheaper</i> they&#x27;ll be, for everyone, and therefore overall everyone&#x27;s real wealth has gone up, on average.<p>It is easy to say that this may result in a greater concentration of wealth, and that will probably be the case. Where I disagree is that it will result in the &quot;everyone else&quot; group being worse off than they are now. At the very least I think their/our quality of life would remain the same.

After that, the &quot;real&quot; doc comes in, and the resident presents to the doc his findings and conclusions.<p>While I guess that some folks might object to an examination by &quot;only&quot; a resident, I find that this helps me because of the interchange between the resident and the teaching doc.

I&#x27;m not much of a frontend developer, but I found things to like about both React and KO. We aren&#x27;t making single page apps, but we do need to create more rich user interfaces in the browser. I spent a week exploring both, creating two different UIs in each.<p>For environments where you don&#x27;t have dedicated frontend people, I think Knockout is more approachable. I very much like the flow based programming ideas behind React, but in the end I think the need to either learn/implement the Flux architecture or having to follow chains of Javascript callbacks really dissuaded my coworkers from supporting it.<p>KO has a more familiar template-like approach. And now that the latest version also offers components, I like that I can use templates where they work and switch to components when necessary, which should eliminate some of the boilerplate I faced in React. I&#x27;m very excited to try out the new KO features, and I&#x27;m always surprised to not see much mention of KO in front end discussions at HN.<p>That being said, while working with KO there were times where I created bugs that would have been impossible or difficult to create with React. But I think for a team of backend developers that don&#x27;t do much frontend work and who aren&#x27;t that familiar with functional programming, React (whether callback property style or using Flux) is too much of a jump.

There is quite a bit of juggling of information to do to pass around the appropriate information between client, server and auth providers that seems to have been nicely abstracted.<p>There were three major challenges for me in my implementation and I&#x27;m wondering how these could be addressed with Satellizer:<p>1. Anonymous content creation that can be attributed to a user upon sign-up or sign-in. On Plunker, anonymous users can create &#x27;plunks&#x27; that will then attributed to them if they decide to register. This is important to allow streamlined user acquisition.<p>2. Account merging when someone accidentally creates two different user accounts with different social identities. This gets weird when anonymous content creation is involved since someone could create content while signed out and would need all that content re-attributed when they sign in.<p>3. Multi-provider authentication. In Plunker, certain features will only be available if the user has linked (for example) Dropbox. This means consumers of the api need to be able to add / remove social identities to / from users.<p>Hope to hear how you might attack these problems with something like Satellizer (or other people&#x27;s approaches that have worked).",1408374482

If you had an oracle you could consult while debugging, you could do this. But we rarely are in that situation. Instead, you can only increase your confidence.<p>In my experience, it is best to fix problems as you find them, even if you are confident that they are not the cause of your current bug. Each thing &quot;wrong&quot; I find in the code leads me to question my current mental model of what is going on. A bug means that, somewhere, there is a difference between my mental model, and what the code actually does. A seemingly unrelated error gives me evidence that my mental model may be <i>even further</i> from reality than I realized. That&#x27;s bad. At that point, I know of at least two deviations from reality. And just like trying to establish causation in a scientific experiment, you want as few variables as possible.",1408374348

I am already doing fine financially, so if I launch a new project it&#x27;s because it has the potential to solve a big problem and consequently to earn good money, that is why I get so motivated.<p>The first time I had a co-founder things didn&#x27;t work out, exactly because I felt I was doing a lot more than my co-founder. For instance, once we had the prototype done we started pitching it to clients, but for every 10 clients I pitched the product my co-founder would pitch to 1. I decided to abort the project as I didn&#x27;t want to do 80% of the work while earning only 50% of the profits. In this case my co-founder was also a developer.<p>After that experience I had the opportunity to co-found products with other people, but I always backed down for the same reason, I was afraid the other person wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep up with me, so I would end up doing most of the hard work. This fear gets amplified when the co-founder is not a technical person, which means I&#x27;ll certainly need to take care of the development aspect myself, while the other person focuses on the business aspects, which in my opinion are much less demanding on software related projects (at least in the early days).<p>And to be clear, I do know how to manage the business aspects too, so it&#x27;s not like without a business co-founder I would be lost.<p>My questions:<p>1. Psychological Aspect: How do I overcome this fear?<p>2. Practical Aspect: How do I structure things with my co-founders so that I don&#x27;t end up doing most of the hard work?",1408374286

I haven&#x27;t put a ton of time into learning Scala and only occasionally interact with it, but in that capacity I&#x27;d definitely say I find it a bit intimidating and someone hard to read.  Certainly there are many ways to write Scala, and a Java-like style is doable, but idiomatic Scala, as far as I&#x27;ve seen, encourages terseness and the use of opaque punctuation-laden operators that aren&#x27;t immediately interpretable by people not familiar with the language.<p>Whether legibility from non-experts is important is absolutely a matter of opinion and personal taste (it&#x27;s a clear source of disagreement between the Python and Ruby communities as well), but if you&#x27;re someone who thinks it&#x27;s an important property for languages that get widespread adoption to have (and I am), looking at Scala code as it seems to typically be written would give you (or at least gives me) pause.

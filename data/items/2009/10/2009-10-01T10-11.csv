You're rehearsing the fallacy I was pointing out: 'could care less' is not fossilized and there is no bloody reason to allow it to fossilize. Moreover, you're comparing something that used to be standard idiom and has fossilized in that state with something that is changing and may fossilize in that new, changed state. The argument for the first rests entirely it's history and age, both of which the second lacks.",1254394248

(and I'm trying to say this right) ... some part of me feels really depressed that a Malawi kid building a scrapyard generator is hailed as being so inspirational.<p>Is our view of Africa <i>so</i> pessimistic, then, <i>so</i> jaded, that what appears to be routine on Scrapheap Challenge is an inspirational act, just because it happened in Africa?  Does it mean we normally operate on the underlying assumption that it is <i>preposterous</i> for the average African kid to work to improve his life, but perfectly normal for a kid in Texas or Utrecht to do so?<p>Does it mean we view the normal functioning of the good human spirit, of generosity and inventiveness, as somehow nonexistent in typical African children and therefore worthy of immense celebration in this one child?   Do these views permeate our governments?  Do we send aid not as the favor a good-natured neighbor would perform in times of duress, but rather as we might offer a beer to a man we have beggared, knowing his condition to be permanent but wishing nonetheless to lend him a moment's joy in a world of suffering?<p>Maybe our celebration of this kid (and it's true, what he did is awesome and helps his village and family out tremendously) is just about being genuinely warmed by the overcoming of a supremely difficult environment.  Or maybe celebrating a minor victory assuages our guilt, pervasive hopelessness, and ultimate indifference regarding Africa.<p>I'm honestly not certain - but every time I see one of these stories, this same feeling of uneasiness comes up, and I'm not sure which way is the truth.  Probably, like everything in the world, it's some of each.",1254393716

854666,comment,852938,854640,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"It’s funny, because you’re not inclined to have a practical discussion rather than a philosophical one — my entire point is that by declaring that people are speaking the language ‘wrong’, you are yourself introducing the entire philosophical question of what ‘wrong’ means. You can’t say people are speaking the language wrong unless you’re ready to define what ‘wrong’ means. And I think you’ve realized that there’s no good way to answer that question.<p>Can you give me another example of where we use the word <i>board</i> in English to mean food? If not, I could ask you never use the phrase <i>room and board</i> again. But that would be silly. It does not matter whether <i>could care less</i> is a one-off instance — it is an idiom and that is the entire point. It does not matter whether you argue that the phrase adds unnecessary complexity to the language: it is already in the language despite your objections, because people use it. There’s nothing you can do to change that. Language is what people say; if they say it, it’s language.<p>It does not impede understanding because the idiomatic usage is pronounced differently. There is no confusion and no ambiguity. What you are saying simply isn’t the case.<p>Finally, it’s not the case that we ‘may or may not’ be going through a period of transition in the language. Language change is always happening.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_change</a>",1254393104

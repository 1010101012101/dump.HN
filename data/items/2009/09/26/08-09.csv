845263,comment,845082,845252,0,0,mahmud,,,"Theory is one thing, practice another. I arrived at this after repeated trial and error; most big advertisers will not talk to a little guy no matter what. I do this just to crack the corporate shell and reach someone, after that we're on first name basis.",1253954075

They are work fast and are more experienced than a young temp or weekend worker. \nFor me the people who are waiting makes a big difference. Couples are good, because when one is paying the other will be handeling the groceries.",1253953681

845256,comment,844490,844490,0,0,daeken,,,"This is the type of thing that bothers me about mandated net/carrier neutrality.  It's all well and good in theory, but in practice it ends up restricting innovation and limits freedom.  If people didn't like what Google Voice brought to the table, they simply wouldn't use it.  All you get when you regulate something like this is yet another way to bludgeon the competition into submission.",1253953476

In the requisite speech, he commented that the hardest term of teaching he ever had was when he had to go from teaching ""Ethics and Corporate Responsibility"" to ""Introduction to Marketing"" with only a 10 minute gap in between.<p>That said, I don't believe that working in advertising gives you a free pass to act dishonestly.  Advertising should be about making people aware of a good product -- not deceiving them about your product's quality.",1253952340

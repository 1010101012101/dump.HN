There are others that pay higher, more here:

They would always crop up.  Indeed, I remember one person using that same argument: That other MT implementations sucked, Apple shouldn't/couldn't do it for the iPhone.  The reality is, MT was a missing feature, and it took them till revision 4 to deliver it.  It wasn't because MT isn't important.  It's because they didn't know how to implement it.

If you do regular multitasking (just split up cpu time between the top N apps) you have no idea how efficient apps are being, or why they are using cpu. You can't easily prioritize certain activities over others (i.e notifications vs. voip vs location). You can't optimize everyone's calls with core library functions (each app would re-implement their background tasks, perhaps poorly).<p>When people say they need multitasking they really mean ""streaming music/skype/background notifications"", like when they say they want flash they really mean they want video.

More interestingly, the number of type annotations can be as little as 1/20th as in C#.<p>The benefit comes from that many ""small"" things you do in C# become much nicer in F#:<p>C#:<p><pre><code>  int target;
  int someValue;
  if (dict.TryGetValue(""key"", out someValue)) {
      target = someValue * 100;
  } else {
      target = 42; // default
  }

F#:<p><pre><code>  let target = match dict.TryGetValue ""key"" with
               | true, x -> x * 100
               | _	   -> 42 // default
</code></pre>
Not only is the code more concise in F#, we get another benefit too. The temporary value x, needed because of the use of out params in C#, no longer exists in the F# version. In C#, this temp val escapes its needed scope - it should only be needed in the branch where it's used, but instead it's now a normal local.<p>A more large scale win is any async code. In F#, you can use the async workflow (monad), and with 1 character (!), you make the compiler emit code that'd take at least 10 extra lines in C#. Inside an async workflow, a let! (example: let! foo = bar.AsyncGetResponse()) is like calling bar.BeginGetResponse, bar.EndGetResponse, while preserving the current exception handlers and all locals. It makes heavily async code trivial to write, where in C#, it's near impossible.",1270746733

8181233,comment,8180493,8180952,2,0,scythe,,,"After reading it, I would say it is really written badly, but the author&#x27;s point seems to be that most of Esperanto&#x27;s structure was basically designed at random, with no particular goals in mind, other than looking superficially similar to other European languages. His substantive objections are as follows:<p>* the language has an excessive number of phonemes<p>me: On this point I disagree strongly. A language with more phonemes can form shorter words and convey information faster. that&#x27;s just basic math (43^9 >> 16^9)<p>* the vocabulary is too large to be practical and has dubious links to other languages. specifically, Basic English requires far fewer (>10x fewer!) words for competence and is more recognizeable due to worldwide borrowing.<p>me: Here I agree. The amount of memorization required is quite large and borrowing words doesn&#x27;t make up for it. Interlingua took a better path, but it targeted the only continent that doesn&#x27;t need it.<p>* synthesis mechanisms are irregular and insufficiently general. in particular, esperanto&#x27;s semantic structure and word synthesis fail to allow the speaker to compensate for missing vocabulary by using compound words or overly general words with attached descriptors<p>[I don&#x27;t understand this sort of thing, but it sounds serious]<p>* the alphabet is needlessly complex. it uses symbols people do not recognize and cannot type in favor of ASCII digraphs with wide recognition.<p>me: Also, it does not accord significant importance to the way that an orange bikeshed would clearly clash with the trees in the background.<p>Okay, fine, I agree. This is just putting the nail in the coffin at this point.<p>* the noun-to-verb-to-adjective declension is not compatible with the structure of meaning, and so cannot be extended in a consistent, predictable way. that is to say, the variety of possible verbs is such that it is basically undecidable what noun should correspond to a given verb in the general case, and vice versa.<p>me: I don&#x27;t know this but as far as I can tell he&#x27;s right. For example, what is the &quot;verb&quot; associated with &quot;electron&quot;?<p>* the language is inherently sexist.<p>me: This is not a trivial criticism.<p>So there are some substantial criticisms in the article, methinks. And you can&#x27;t discount the impact of difficulty on network effects: if one person has too much trouble learning Esperanto, they&#x27;re not going to pass it on to their friends, who will not pass it on to their friends.<p>I wonder if a language designed to be usable with as small a core as possible -- something the author suggests -- could have a substantially better chance of catching on? Perhaps if it were also good at borrowing words from other languages (&quot;extensible&quot;), and grew in the right community for a little while...",1408085784

8181223,comment,8180493,8180639,7,0,WildUtah,,,"What I wrote about Esperanto and its failure to go viral:<p>&quot;There&#x27;s already an existing language that fulfills so many of those criteria that it&#x27;s going to be very hard to organize a new one from scratch. And the existing language already has a deep legacy of literature and culture.<p>That language is the world&#x27;s second most widespread: Spanish.<p>Spanish has been destroying the dreams of Esperantists and others over the years who hope to build a more regular, orderly, and easy to learn common language based on common Indo-European roots.<p>Turns out that it&#x27;s dang hard to design anything easier or more accessible to speakers of any European language than Spanish already is. The spelling and pronunciation are already completely regular and predictable. The grammar is straightforward and common to almost all European tongues. The vocabulary is mostly based on Latin with some Arabic variety thrown in, but it&#x27;s been standardized over the centuries so that a lot of it has a simpler and more natural morphology. The sounds are a simple subset of what most languages already use.<p>It&#x27;s a great second language: it&#x27;s fairly easy, the world&#x27;s second most widespread tongue, and spoken in warm countries with very friendly natives. It&#x27;s not likely to provide you with many lucrative business opportunities, though. None of the world&#x27;s financial capitals use it.&quot;",1408085189

I’m a long time reader, first time poster with a question: Is there an open health and/or fitness tracking api?<p>Obviously with the rise of wearable technology, fitness tracking has become very popular.  And many a company have created systems for tracking, storing, and analyzing the data.  These include the forthcoming Apple Healthkit and Google fit, but also include Microsoft Healthvault, Nike Plus, Fitbit, and RunKeeper HealthGraph to name a few.  But all of these are limited to what the technology company allows you to store/retrieve and require you to put your health data on their servers.<p>Therefore, I am wondering is there a such thing as an open health/fitness api.  This would like be a combination of open source, platform agnostic and self hostable.",1408083391

Acquired for $101M then subsequently shut down in 1-2 years (just kidding of course).<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my best interest to answer this publicly, but screw it. The honest answer is I&#x27;m not entirely too sure, but an acquisition is always on the table for any startup IMO. I think whenever you ask a founder, &quot;If someone offered you $100M, would you take it?&quot;, it&#x27;s a pretty loaded question.<p>There&#x27;s really three outcomes to a startup: They die, they get acquired, they IPO. The thing is, if you think your company is valued at $1M and someone offers you $100M, of course you&#x27;re most likely going to take it. It&#x27;s 100x what you were expecting and it would be unwise not to take it. However, if you deep down believe that your company is worth more or can be worth more than the offering price and you have the proof to back it up, then it&#x27;d be unwise to take the offer.<p>For me, I strongly believe that email has A LOT to go. I mean, it&#x27;s nearly 2016 and I still can&#x27;t connect my Dropbox to my Gmail app client or send stuff into Evernote / Trello? Given all the time we spend on email, shouldn&#x27;t we at least have some better automation / AI integration by now? Something smarter and more contextually aware that can make my life a bit easier?<p>So many people use email in the world. Literally everyone that has a Facebook account has to have an email account. I think the reason why we haven&#x27;t seen a billion dollar plus company yet is that it&#x27;s very ubiquitous and it&#x27;s hard to build solutions for the masses. So companies give up, sell out, close down, and then we have to start again at ground zero.<p>So to your question, what&#x27;s the end goal? Well, if we&#x27;re right about our beliefs, hopefully we can become the next billion dollar company. If not, then it&#x27;s the other two options: get acquired or die. Which one will it be?

10692063,comment,10691294,10691294,0,0,CM30,,,"Nice article.  But I think there are a few other things they missed out that make building an email client so difficult:<p>1. Consistency.  Okay, this is always going to be a problem, since rendering anything more than plain text in emails is a minefield that makes the bad old days of Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator look like a utopia. But people still expect their Amazon/eBay/Google/whatever account/confirmation emails to look decent, so you have to figure out a basic HTML parser as well.  And then try and make it somewhat work with people who are designing their messages with stuff like Outlook&#x27;s Microsoft Word engine in mind.<p>2. Spam.  I&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t really mentioned in the article, but it&#x27;s arguably the biggest issue any email provider, client developer or email server software maker has to deal with.  You have to make sure your software can figure out what messages are unwanted, then either send them to the spam folder or delete them.  Most startups don&#x27;t have to figure that out, since their systems are closed and spam prevention can be done on sign up.  Not so much if you&#x27;re building an email client where any Tom, Dick or Harry can send messages to anyone with no real way to verify if they&#x27;re human or not.<p>So yeah, few other issues.",1449517067

Fredrick Winslow Taylor was the favorite industrial theorist of both the Harvard Business School and Josef Stalin, which should set off all alarms right there.<p>In Taylorism, &quot;skills&quot; are replaced with &quot;processes&quot;. Employees are taught to do small, simple, repeatable, and thoroughly documented processes, without understanding of how the whole system works. This covers huge swaths of manual labor today - both factory labor and service jobs like fast food tend to be heavily Taylorized.<p>The value of Taylorism isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s more efficient than relying on skilled workers. It&#x27;s <i>less</i> efficient, and unashamedly so. But it has the side effect of disempowering the worker. Employees are now replaceable cogs, to be fired on a whim and replaced by the next warm body who can be taught the steps (and punished even for improving on them). Taylorism shifts the balance of power between employer and employee strongly in the employer&#x27;s favor.<p>The only &quot;safe&quot; jobs in a Taylorized society are those that demand skills immune to Taylorizing, like engineering (and that&#x27;s mostly because any job I do that can be replaced with a dumb human process can also be replaced with a program).",1449516948

There was practically no documentation on this and it felt like I was venturing into territory never before seen.<p>* Parsing emails to be display correctly seems impossible. Sometimes emails have &quot;<br>&quot; in them and sometimes they have &quot;\n&quot;. But what if the &quot;\n&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean newline but it&#x27;s just what someone wrote in the email? They come in a variety of mime types and formats. It sometimes seems impossible to do this.<p>* Not everyone uses the RFC standards! I thought the RFC said that a subject can only be 78 chars long. Yet I get emails all day long that go way beyond this which cause major problems in my code. AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE THAT CARES ABOUT RFCS?",1449516653

(<a href=""http://inky.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inky.com</a>) The challenges outlined in this thread are all accurate. If you&#x27;re thinking about putting effort (or money) behind an email startup, think again. I simply don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s doable for a normal startup (i.e., one without a crazy rich guy plowing money into it until it&#x27;s good enough). The VC-backed &quot;winners&quot; will all get aqui-hired, and then the acquirers will be unhappy because what they bought wasn&#x27;t actually good enough for prime time.<p>Here are just a handful of the reasons:<p>- It is deceptively hard. Like airfare pricing, most people think it&#x27;s a couple weekends of work, when in fact it&#x27;s at least 5 years and millions of lines of code to get to a real MVP that someone could use instead of Outlook, Thunderbird or Apple Mail, etc... The set of abstractions required to do it right are unobvious and nontrivial, and you end up with unfixable problems if you don&#x27;t get them all right. We&#x27;ve rewritten Inky essentially from scratch twice, and only in the current version 3 (circa October 2015) do we finally have the abstractions correct. Look at the Thunderbird bugzilla logs and you will find thousands of bug entries, many of which go on for pages and pages. ITA was similar, by the way: 1996-2001 was basically iteration to get to an MVP.<p>And because it&#x27;s not just hard, but <i>deceptively hard,</i> founders and their teams systematically underestimate the effort required, which leads to all kinds of failure modes. Even in the success stores like Mailbox, the teams basically punt on a number of hard problems that really are required for an MVP (like properly sanitizing HTML, supporting Exchange and IMAP &quot;for real&quot;, proper support for all the weirdly encoded mail you see in the wild, encrypted mail via S/MIME, etc.)<p>- The other entities you have to work with are a complete nightmare, and as the client app everything appears to be your fault. Google, Apple, Yahoo, etc. just do whatever the hell they want, randomly, have broken servers they never fix, and place arbitrary problematic restrictions on clients: all limit clients to a small number of connections, and Apple won&#x27;t let an email app run in the background, so you can&#x27;t support &quot;real&quot; push notifications without keeping the user&#x27;s credentials unencrypted in the cloud (which I refuse to do). Google, out of the blue, started banning clients that didn&#x27;t use oAuth, sending users scary messages about unsafe software. oAuth is great, but just breaking everyone who doesn&#x27;t support it yet is really, really nasty.<p>- VCs absolutely hate the space. Email startups have been dogs forever, and every name-brand VC has been burned on a crappy email investment.<p>- Consumers simply don&#x27;t care about usability, privacy, or anything else enough to not use what comes with their phones.<p>- Security-conscious people who might pay for something that&#x27;s genuinely secure never believe anything is genuinely secure in practice unless it&#x27;s open source... in which case there is no business model.<p>- Existing mainstream clients are ironically sticky, because once users develop coping strategies to deal with the quirks of the client they&#x27;re forced to use, they never want to invest the effort into learning the quirks of a new client.<p>So why do I work on it? Because in my opinion it&#x27;s a really important problem that affects billions of people -- and one that needs to be solved properly by folks who are doing it not just as a data harvesting operation, loss-leader to sell devices, or as a way to build a moat around a core offering (search).",1449516339

But why were people&#x27;s votes for sale so cheaply?<p>During Rome&#x27;s ascendancy, the citizen-soldier institution sent hundreds of thousands of Roman men out into the world on military campaigns. As their successes grew, so did their terms of military service.<p>In turn, this lead to the collapse of the farms that these men used to work in order to provide for themselves and their family. These farms were purchased by the patrician class, and worked by slaves.<p>Within a few generations, wealth inequality in Rome was so bad that most of the households that had previously been small landholders were reduced to urban poverty.<p>Some Roman politicians did attempt to address this stifling inequality (such as the Gracchi brothers). After the Senate repeatedly murdered such &quot;class traitors&quot;, the compromise of bread and circuses became the Senatorial (and later, Imperial) solution to the problems that the Senatorial classes had themselves caused.<p>Universal income in Rome was a symptom of a completely dysfunctional society. Rome collapsed because its working classes ceased to work, but its working classes ceased to work because its ruling classes ceased to rule for the benefit of the many. Rome was brought down by its wealthy elite.<p>If modern Western societies really are analogous to Rome (which they probably aren&#x27;t), then universal income may herald the collapse. However, if it does, then this collapse will have been ultimately precipitated by the aggregation of power in the hands of the wealthy.<p>In any case, pointing the finger at the Roman poor is a historical trend that was conjured by Rome&#x27;s ruling classes to justify their own positions (think of all the howling about the &quot;welfare poor&quot; by the well-off in North American society today) and later by conservative British historians to justify the lopsided distribution of wealth and power in their own society.

While on the way out, I observed a cop issuing some sort of traffic citation to another parent on their way in.  This was causing a major delay for hundreds of cars, due to this guy blocking the only way in and out with two stationary vehicles, one being the typical suburban full-time-parent kid-chauffeuring battle-tank SUV.<p>I may have allowed an annoyed look to appear on my face.<p>Seconds later, this same guy was pulling <i>me</i> over.  The reason?  My vehicle stickers expire February 28th.  I renewed online late in the month (the shortest month, naturally), and the replacement stickers had not yet arrived in the mail.  Fortunately for me, I had the printed receipt of my renewal transaction on the front passenger seat of my car.  (The stickers arrived in the mail later that day.)<p>While walking away, the guy tells me, &quot;Next time don&#x27;t wait until the last minute to renew.&quot;  ~Dude.  I&#x27;m sorry that my timely production of exculpatory evidence precluded you from ratcheting one tick closer to your ticket quota.~  If you&#x27;re going to be overzealous in enforcing the revenue laws, I don&#x27;t need to hear any complaints about me paying the full amount and on time.<p>Next time, and all subsequent times, I will try the &quot;not making your job easier&quot; approach.

I <i>know</i> he had an in-car computer that showed him my current registration and insurance status.  He probably pulled me over because I gave him a dirty look for screwing up car line, and he wanted to be an extra-big dick about it.<p>The policing for profit has to stop.  Whether its from dubious municipal court fines and fees or War on Drugs grants, the distorted flow of money is rewriting the relationship between police and public.  The public is simultaneously employer to and customer of the police.  That means that the cop has the burden of being professional and respectful at all times, even in the face of horrendous rudeness.<p>When a waiter or delivery driver gets stiffed on a tip, they suck it up, maybe post a pic to social media, and move on.  When a cop gets frowned at, they swagger up, solicit some respeck for their authoritah, and maybe hurt someone while the cameras are inexplicably turned off.  It should not matter whether or not the public gives or withholds respect.  Those cops are on the clock and serving customers.  If those customers are curt with front-line employees, perhaps it is because the company as a whole has been behaving as badly as AT&T or Comcast.<p>Just as you may get better results being calm and polite with your customer service rep while on the phone with those companies, you still might get a freakin&#x27; Ernestine, not caring about you, because the company is a [local] monopoly and it doesn&#x27;t have to.

10691788,comment,10685785,10685785,0,0,api,,,"I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll quibble with a few things.<p>(1) Conspiracies<p>I totally disagree. I find long-lived conspiracies quite believable, but with the caveat that they must be socially realistic and have plausible operating principles.<p>First of all, a long-lived complex conspiracy cannot remain <i>totally</i> secret. That&#x27;s not plausible. Something&#x27;s going to leak. But it can act and/or distract (disinformation, etc.) so as to limit the damage and exposure brought about by these leaks. Keep in mind that in today&#x27;s information overload world the information might be out there but if it&#x27;s not clamoring for attention it will be ignored. When was the last time you Googled the secret initiatory practices of the Order of the Blahblahblah?<p>But more importantly: people do not engage in long term coordinated complex action without motive, and just &quot;eeeevil!!&quot; or even just profit or power are not sufficient motives to keep people in a coherent &quot;always-cooperate&quot; game theoretic mode with one another for that long. If power and profit are the motive then the group will dissolve through internal strife. Other motives are needed.<p>A long-lived complex conspiracy therefore rapidly converges with religion or cult. It must have a Doctrine(tm), an initiation process, some form of eschatology either real or metaphysical, etc. If it&#x27;s a really nasty cult-driven-conspiracy it might employ cult mind control techniques. These as we know from the real world can be devastatingly effective. Whole massive groups of people have been convinced to commit suicide (Jonestown), so why couldn&#x27;t they be convinced to perpetuate a lasting criminal or &quot;parapolitical&quot; conspiracy even at risk to themselves and their own personal fortune or power?<p>A plausible Big Bad X-Files Conspiracy therefore must be a cult and is going to look and operate like a cult. It&#x27;s going to have internal cult jargon and crazy doctrines that will sound shockingly batshit to outsiders but that internally actually serve as belief-and-language-based social signaling. (Galactic emperor Xenu, etc.) If it&#x27;s a conspiracy that lasts longer than a life span then it must have a doctrine that transcends the personality of its leadership and some mechanism for transfer of kingship. It&#x27;s going to have totally brainwashed True Believers following manipulative and obsessed upper management for whom the cult is a proxy for their personal ego. It&#x27;s going to have some process for both initiating new members and purging itself of dissent. The later is going to look like the shame-driven practices you see in manipulative cults in which the dissenter is first shamed and vilified before being banished or killed.<p>Profit or power are not sufficient motives, but a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; can be a part of cult mind control. Membership may have its benefits if the cult is powerful, rich, or well-connected, and once one has accepted these favors they are a &quot;made man&quot; indebted to the cult. Blackmail can also play a role. Many gangs and mafia groups require members to commit a crime or misdeed in order to join, and revelation of that crime or misdeed can later be dangled as punishment.<p>Fundamentally a long-lived conspiracy with coherent goals is going to be a cult that operates a lot like the mafia. In fact it&#x27;s not uncommon for mafia like criminal conspiracies to have racial identity doctrines, honor codes, a romantic image of themselves, and other mythologies that serve at the very least as social glue. Many began with political goals -- the true Mafia were if my memory serves me originally a political resistance. Combine that with some crazy-ass religion or political eschatology and you&#x27;ve got your cigarette smoking man and his compatriots nailed.<p>I actually take an opposite tack on conspiracies: while I think the woo-woo variety of conspiracy theory is woo, I also think there&#x27;s a kind of faux-rationalistic over-reaction in skeptic circles that amounts to &quot;coherent group motive denialism.&quot; Conspire just means &quot;to act together,&quot; and secrecy through flat silence or through distraction is definitely possible within certain realistic bounds. Hell, if nobody wanted to ever be secret we never would have invented encryption!<p>Finally though -- it is true that nothing remains the same forever. At some point one of two things is going to happen: the conspiracy/cult is going to act in a big way and in so doing both reveal itself and immanentize its eschaton, or it&#x27;s going to fade away and dissolve into socioeconomic background radiation. If the group is strongly motivated the former is more likely, <i>especially</i> if it feels &quot;the time is nigh&quot; (it has enough power) or conversely if it feels itself losing power and feels forced to act. Sometimes the latter is driven by the leadership&#x27;s need to maintain internal credibility. If people start doubting then they must escalate. (Some propose that ISIS is now launching international terror for exactly this reason, though they are far from secret. But the same principle applies.)<p>... and remember that end-justifies-the-mean fanatics can be <i>very very bad</i>, so we&#x27;re well into plausible villain territory. If the end justifies the mean and the ideology provides a moral &#x27;out&#x27;, people will do insanely evil stuff... like... I dunno... tell people gas chambers are showers? Open fire on cafes? Force children to drink poison? Only the author&#x27;s personal depravity is the limit to what they might imagine such a group plausibly doing when the chips are down.<p>Who knows, maybe that&#x27;s a big part of the story? What happens when your dismissed-as-wacko conspiracy nut is proven <i>dramatically</i> &quot;as in breaking news&quot; correct? Or maybe your conspiracy theorists&#x27; investigations actually prod the group into paranoia-driven action? Such a group is likely more paranoid than the foil hatters that might chase them.<p>An alternative plot twist I thought up once for the X-Files and that would fit into the emerging &#x27;rational fiction&#x27; trope is if Mulder discovered that while (most of) the paranormal stuff wasn&#x27;t real and the aliens weren&#x27;t invading... <i>the conspiracy that The Smoking Man belonged to believed alien invasion was nigh</i> and was all the more dangerous as a result. The stuff that did turn out to be real might have a rational (but perhaps still very SF) explanation... and the conspiracy plot revolves around how its existence has inspired insane paranoia among an element of our intelligence apparatus who are utterly convinced it&#x27;s a sign of impending alien invasion. Think of it as a more elaborate SF-based version of a comet inspiring a dangerous doomsday cult. The big finale could have been Mulder now struggling to find a credible way to reveal the truth about UFOs (which might still have a neat SF edge... von Neumann probes?) to the world not just for truth&#x27;s sake but to stop the impending global-scale Jonestown meltdown of the conspiracy.<p>(2) World-controlling corporations<p>I sort of agree and disagree. A world-controlling corporation is plausible but will have in becoming such a thing become a government. Therefore you have a similar convergence path here as you do with conspiracy -> long lived conspiracy -> cult. Corporation -> mega-powerful totalistic corporation -> nation state.<p>To become a government requires that the corp evolve new traits like a national mythology, the adoption of governmental function and ritual, and a support base in the general population. The latter is important: for this to happen, someone has to think it&#x27;s a good idea!<p>It&#x27;s not impossible that a corporate entity could undergo such a metamorphosis while retaining some of its original mega-corp DNA. But it would most certainly no longer be a corporation in the traditional sense. It would have some sort of national identity.<p>The socioeconomic, political, or technological forces that might push a corporation down this road and lead to it emerging as a government/nation might be quite interesting. It&#x27;s not at all implausible given that Congress has something like a 15% approval rating.<p>Here&#x27;s a back story for you: an aggressive Uber-like startup invents an economically plausible win/win way to shrink the exploding wealth disparity in developed nations... maybe something based on an innovation in game theory. But to make it work they need to change a few laws. Fast forward a hundred years and you have a global socialist state presided over by something that is now a government but retains the organizational DNA of an Uber-like growth company. For its brand of game theoretic win/win socialism to keep working it <i>must</i> meet certain numbers, which leads in practice to some kind of nutty/weird Keynesianism. ... and of course dissenters are <i>provably</i> (via game theory) threatening the well being of all.<p>That&#x27;s quite plausible and no idiot ball is required.<p>(3) Space travel<p>I disagree that routine space travel is implausible, but I do agree that if you do it and have any <i>hard SF</i> aspirations then you must read up on physics and orbital mechanics. You&#x27;ve got to make a genuine attempt to make it physically plausible... unless of course you&#x27;re going the SF-flavored-fantasy route of Star Wars in which case that&#x27;s okay too. In that case it&#x27;s got to at least be in-world consistent and not terribly cliche.<p>I do agree that MacGuffins like He3 are unlikely. Really interesting original motives for space travel and/or settlement are much better. These could include necessity (Seveneves), politics (escaping global dystopia), religion (or desire to freely practice such in a world where that&#x27;s forbidden), weird but plausible economics (after two generations of global Japan-style stagnation, the World Central Bank decides a big space economy would make a better stimulus package than WWIII and launches a PR effort to sell it, etc.), a massive discovery that demands a major exploration effort, etc.<p>One that I&#x27;ve toyed around with is this: that in an almost post-scarcity and incredibly rich society people might do space travel for the same reason they climb Everest or try to break deep sea diving records... to have fun and show off. Implausible today but not implausible in an economy 10X larger or where technology like reusable spacecraft has geometrically reduced cost. Space travel and attempts at space settlement could be a <i>sport</i>. Think a cross between extreme mountaineering and Nascar.",1449515141

Now lets assume you decide you want a new toy, or some general spending money. Your base government income has your rent and food paid for, but you want fun money.<p>How much time is that fun money worth? Would you work a whole week for $50? What about $200?<p>I also wonder if there&#x27;s a bit of a mental incentive to push you to better yourself. If you&#x27;re working a week for $200, maybe you consider it a waste of your time. So, you fight for a better job, maybe through training or education. Now you&#x27;ve got plenty of fun money, but you also start to raise your base lifestyle <i>(and income requirements)</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these are absolutes of course, i&#x27;m just curious what would happen in these sort of environments.

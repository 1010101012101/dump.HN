373763,comment,373675,373738,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"You're not reading the hypothesis correctly:<p><i>Asian children, by contrast, don't face nearly that same sense of bafflement... maybe that makes them a little more likely to enjoy math, and maybe because they enjoy math a little more they try a little harder and take more math classes and are more willing to do their homework, and on and on, in a kind of virtuous circle.</i><p>The argument is not that the clarity of the Chinese-language numbers is, in itself, that big of an advantage once kids grow beyond four, five, or seven years of age. The argument is that kids who are comfortable with math at age four are more likely to remain happy with math throughout the rest of their schooling, whereas loss of confidence at an early age results in loss of future confidence.<p>Obviously, while you can test the difference in math skills among seven-year-olds, this stronger hypothesis is hard to test rigorously, because you can't easily control for all the other cultural differences. But it's a very interesting idea, nonetheless. One of the most amusing things about this hypothesis is that it mirrors the difference between the English and Chinese written languages: Chinese writing is badly designed compared to alphabetic systems, to the point where there are serious effects on the literacy rate.

Before Nitrogen, most people did the front end in Rails and the back end in Erlang, and used a bridge, such as Apache Thrift, to get them talking.<p>Once your web app is in Erlang, you can:<p>* Run on Mochiweb or Yaws, both extremely performant http servers.<p>* Distribute your web server across multiple nodes without worrying about sticky sessions.<p>* Reap all of the other Erlang goodness, such as hot code swapping, built in application monitoring and restarting, an extremely stable environment, etc. (All of the stuff that made Amazon use Erlang for SimpleDB and Facebook use Erlang for Facebook Chat.)<p>""What about the DB layer?""<p>Mnesia, Erlang's built in database, actually does the job quite well. Languages tend to add a DB layer to ease the pain of jumping into and out of SQL, and we're so used to this that we expect to have to do the same in any language. But in this case, Mnesia thinks in Erlang syntax, so there is really no need to wrap it in anything. Plus, Mnesia works really well for documents with changing schemas, which is very Web 2.0.<p>If you'd rather avoid Mnesia and use SQL, then ErlyDB is your best option.<p>Happy to answer any more questions.<p>Best,<p>Rusty - Creator of Nitrogen Web Framework<p>p.s. - Saw this post through a backtype.com alert (hooray BackType!)",1227454317
373755,comment,373400,373400,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"An old principle here perhaps: evolution does not mean making an organism more complex or ""better"" necessarily, only ""more adapted"", so sometimes more complex organisms can become less complex organisms, such as cave fish losing their ability to see. Similarly, perhaps with memes. Better adapted memes mean just that, better adapted, even if they are completely insane from one way of looking at things. So if the meme of say plastic wishbones mentioned in this article is adapted for some crazy reason, it will find a niche. This is the dark side of evolution. Sometimes organisms lose features and complexity for the sake of adaptation, and perhaps there is a memetic corollary here to, sometimes in the free market the most adapated memes are some of the most insane or revolting, from an aesthetic standpoint. Which just proves the ""selfish gene/meme"" paradigm - if they can get copied, they will, and they don't care about whatever pain or suffering or cultural decline that may occur as a result.",1227454294

Tell me if you post it on Reddit: I'd like to see the answers.<p>I'm still a virgin, because - somehow - I still believe in abstinence until marriage. No clue how long that will last. And I find it really sad that people tend to become cynical about lust and sex and romance. Thanks to that, the best relationship I had started with the girl being with another (pretty awful) guy: we got really interested in each other at least in part because it was so clandestine at first, so larger-than-life.<p>And I don't know if it's because of youth or not, but I loathe people who are very into romance and very <i>against</i> any sort of physical contact. I think that's like the exact reverse of casual sex and it's just as bad. There needs to be a balance.<p>Cheers.",1227454201

The people here are always in it to get back at a boyfriend or they're too drunk to realize just what they're doing. That's what I can't stand.<p>I think that people who worry about livings and books are often just as bad, to be fair. I switched out of an English major because I realized that the people I knew going for English were often really out-of-sync with the real world and were really unpleasant people. I moved to a major that had a few people who were really with it, and formed a group there.<p>I've never seen <i>American Beauty</i>. Would you recommend it?",1227453965

It's a good college, but it's mind-numbingly slow. I already have a general idea of what I want to do, so a lot of the introductory classes seem pointless and dull. I also feel really guilty about using money that's not mine to take classes that I don't feel will affect what I do later in life.<p>Right now, I'm in that sort of ""isolation."" I have friends, and a bit of a social life on campus, but the whole of it really doesn't interest me. The problem that I and my cofounder have is that we both attended handpicked programs a summer ago, with an absolutely top-notch set of students from across the state. (I went for the arts, he went for the sciences.) Both of us are finding college a let-down after the intense 8-hour-day programs that those were, hence us starting up.<p>As for college: I really don't think leaving and never returning would be a good idea. But we're applying to YCombinator this summer, and we figure that one way or another it might be worth a year away from college to try our hands at entrepreneurship. We've got a good idea and a good product; worst comes to worst, we'll go back to college after a year much wiser and much more understanding of what we want to do with our lives.",1227453717

I read this as: ""self-directed learning is a necessary condition for achieving rockstar level skill."" My point is that in other fields, institutional training can create rockstars without self-directed learning. That is to say, self-directed learning is not a necessary condition.<p>Your point is that programming is different from those other fields, because you can become a rockstar learning on your own. I.e. that self-directed learning can be a sufficient condition for achieving rockstar level skill. But that does not contradict my point, which is that it is not a necessary one.",1360216623

One day a friend told me that theres a really cool site called Hacker News which I should check out .

I do know, however, that reddit gold members get this functionality via the more-inefficient server-side magic. The coolest thing about the reddit gold implementation is that it allows you to select highlighting of comments from different times of past views so if you happened to visit but not read the new comments they're not wiped out on you.<p>About the original topic of conversion, discourse, I think I really need to see the site without all the cruft before deciding much about it.

Prime among this is the ability to spawn off a discussion thread from a main post to its own subpost. I always though that subthreads tend to get derailed to the point of needing to be a separate discussion. I think that what really matters is how the surrounding communities use such features. It being a playpen that is wiped every day, with users coming in to test features over and over might be painting my experience a bit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hckrnews.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hckrnews.com/about.html</a>",1360213940

For something like Hacker News, flat would be a nightmare as it is such a large loosely connected community and each submission usually generates comments that are only loosely connected.<p>A smaller online community, maybe a few thousand where all the regular contributors know each other can have flat work fine depending on the topics discussed.<p>What is the answer?

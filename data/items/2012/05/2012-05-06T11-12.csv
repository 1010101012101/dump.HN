That doesn't mean people are ready to ditch social networks outright, but it means that the stupidest abuses are going to leave a sour taste in peoples' mouths, and Zynga is so well associated with these behaviors that, even if people like some of their games, no one likes <i>them</i>.<p>Zynga's asset is that they understand addictive behavior and are probably the world's leading experts in a specific niche, which is the online delivery of addictive (not always high-quality) games through social media, and the monetization thereof. This knowledge is going to be valuable no matter what happens in social media over the next 5 years. Their brand and reputation are decidedly <i>NOT</i> assets. The opposite, actually.<p>If Zynga's executive team is smart, they're going to stop being a primary publisher and acquirer and start working behind the scenes, like a consultant, using their knowledge without doing brand-damage to the games they work on, because even though 90% of people don't care about a game company's reputation, the people who set trends do, and by 2014 no one will play Zynga games.",1336305469

Think small programming exercises, IQ tests, personality tests etc. Use this to establish a minimum score for hiring.
2) Apply these same tests to all prospective employees. 
3) Of all the candidates that meet the minimum criteria, hire a random set of them.
4) Follow up the progress of all these employees over 1-2 years.<p>Now, this would never fly in many legal senses, and I doubt that anyone will ever let me do it, but it would provide useful data to improve hiring processes. I suspect that this would need to be done for each individual company at least 100+ times before you would start to be able to derive useful patterns.<p>Some hypotheses:
1) non linear  relationship between IQ and performance

You speak a single language, you have a single president, a federal senate, a federal army, a federal police, a powerful federal intelligence agency, and many institutions at the federal level.

However there's a market, there's people who dearly love the iPhone but can't justify the full price device, or kids or someone who's transitioning to their first smart device.<p>So Apple has a situation. Go low end and basically go against the corporate ethic, or allow Moore's Law to let them price the previous generation down so they're still making a profit but allows them to fight at a lower price point.

VARCHAR(12) is a VARCHAR which can not go beyond 12 characters, CHAR(12) is a fixed-size string which will <i>be padded</i> to 12 characters.<p>I'm pretty sure Rails uses VARCHAR (or its equivalent in other DBs) exclusively. But unless a size is specified it will use VARCHAR(255). VARCHAR(16) will enforce a maximum size (through truncation) and may (depending on the database[0]) lead to optimizations by storing the string differently and/or ending with lower row (and table) sizes.<p>As for TFA, his example using phone numbers is not very good because while there are standard sizes for phone numbers (E.164 allows for 15 digits including a country code of 1-3 digits, giving national number maximums of 12 to 14 digits depending on the country) people usually fuck them up hard (by using the sizes  and formattings  of their home countries), and when adding local formatting conventions it's an even bigger messes (depending on the country, you can have up to half a dozen format characters interspersed between digit groups)<p>[0] it does not in Postgres: as your link notes, Postgres will dynamically decide how to store a string  in-row or out-of-row for instance  on the spot based on its size. On the other hand maximum string size has an effect on Postgres indexes: b-tree (the default) will blow up on strings beyond 4k chars, and this is <i>not</i> statically checked by postgres, it will blow up while trying to insert a string of more than 4k chars.<p>Of course if you're trying to index a string column with such sizes using anything but full-text indexes you're probably doing something wrong anyway, but if you're using VARCHAR (which maxes out at 1GB due to implementation details) you <i>may</i> find yourself in that situation even though you're only storing 4-letter codes.<p>In that case, you're better off using VARCHAR(4).",1336302084

But in another way it convinced me that Python is actually fine for most of what I'm doing since it's easy to drop in to C for parts that need performance. And even more importantly there are often already already C libraries with python bindings that do the thing I'm looking for (ie parsing, numpy, etc).",1334192044

It's a massively-scalable, decentralized, asynchronous messaging system that supports large file attachments. At this, it excels. There's not one big evil company controlling all messages and unless you're sending massive amounts of emails every day, your messages almost always end up exactly where they're supposed to. I'd challenge anybody to do better.<p>The author's main gripe is Mailer Daemon messages. It's not <i>email's</i> fault that people write shitty clients that don't display a pretty failure message. If your car doesn't have anti-lock breaks, it's not the road's fault when you hit a patch of ice and slam into a tree.<p>Email is great not only because it works simply and beautifully, but because it's so extendable. People think it's broken. It's not. It's just simple...and it's this same simplicity that makes it easy to build on top of. Look at Gmail or Xobni. Both have incredible features that ""email"" doesn't have because they took the time to build extras on top that make it work nicely.<p>Email is NOT broken. There's nothing to fix. Whatever fixes you think it needs <i>you can make yourself</i>. The underlying platform works great. If you have a problem, write/patch a client.",1334191842

  Social networking notifications
  Text messaging
  Planning meetings
  Planning vacation
  Discussing issues with colleagues (mailing list)
  Bill notifications
  Newsletters / grey mail
  File sharing
</code></pre>
We do all of those different things and shove them into a single client that was designed (with minor alterations) over 30 years ago.  What were they using email for then?  To send holy shit, this is cool! messages to other neckbeards.<p>We should be using a separate client for all of these uses.  Email is nothing more than a messaging protocol.  You could launch a group texting app and use email as the delivery protocol. Your user base would instantly be every person with an internet connection.  It wouldnt matter that person A has your app and person B doesnt, you could make it transparent to the person that has the app and pitch to the person that doesnt.<p>The biggest obstacle to this is that we all use regular old email clients today and increasing the already incredible noise would not be without backlash.  I think you have to start out with apps that dont require adding to your message count (a notification app that scrapes your inbox, for example).<p>Meanwhile startups are trying and failing to make every service its own silo that travels over port 80.

Half of those above projects were written when JVM, .Net and python/ruby/etc were mature widely used solutions.<p>Think about what a gc pause would do to an OS - it could kill performance for every single process on the system, cause issues with input buffers overflowing, and other related issues. A microsecond here and there in call latency may not matter most of the time, but in thousands of syscalls or in low level network processing have large cumulative effects.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love my high level languages and modern GC runtimes, but there are days and places when microseconds and bytes still matter, and for those, I still grab C. Just like the nailgun hasn't fully replaced the hammer, or the vacuum hasn't fully replaced the broom, there is a good reason C still exists and finds acceptance.<p>Maybe Go or Rust will start to creep even more into the C space than JVM etc already have, but I really don't see it fully going away, it is just too useful and a well understood proper tool for some jobs.",1334188958

Sure, German isn't the easiest language, and most Germans aren't willing to use a English-only service.<p>Still, there's enough translators and copywriters available, never mind that anything big enough will probably have a local support team anyway. And the market seems big enough to justify that investment. If that argument would fly, is France any better off? About 4 times as many high school students learning it, roughly comparable market<p>And I'd need to see actual evidence for the ""attention to detail"" argument. Germans are prone to be portrayed as perfectionists, now apparently for consumption, too. Little of that is true (well, at least more true than for Americans). After all, Germans are buying MS Windows, too<p>So in my opinion, the added localization effort and the fictitious ""cultural divide"" aren't the true reasons for the copycats gaining ground. It's mostly a lack of focus on foreign markets in the first place. The US is a huge market, and by the time most companies try to expand their horizon in a serious manner, a ripoff has its chance and will make some money.

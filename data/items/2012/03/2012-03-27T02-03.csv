i wonder if this is because their lizard brain hasn't yet been trained to filter what's important vs what isn't.<p>i find myself constantly questioning little details in my codebase like, ""why do we thread a request all the way through the business logic"" and i think the reason i catch these things, is because my brain hasn't become complacent with this style through 15 years of solving low level problems in C. all sorts of things jump out at me as accidental complexity that the most senior guys don't even notice. i think it's because it didn't used to be important, or maybe its not important to them because they wrote it over years and are already familiar, but it sure is important when you're trying to scale your team and they're facing a brick wall of code needing to be understood for every single little defect.<p>this complacency is why big codebases get so noisy that you can't see the nuances of requirements in a code review. it's not possible to ask high level questions like < <a href=""http://www.dustingetz.com/how-to-read-code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dustingetz.com/how-to-read-code</a> > without aggressively abstracting away all non-essential complexity. breaking experienced people out of this complacent tolerance for accidental complexity, as we tackle higher and higher complexity, is a really hard problem.",1332817069

Initially, money is brought in from a CC, but they just moved to Bank Accounts.

3759779,comment,3752859,3752859,3,0,ArloBelshee,,,"(I'm the author of the original paper. So take my ramblings here with a grain of salt.)<p>The experimentation that led to Promiscuous Pairing was certainly based on the practical. It was not scientific; it was process engineering. We had no goal to make a great discovery. Rather, we had to ship software RTFN, so we were optimizing our process to do so.<p>The company board had told us that they were liquidating the company if we didn't have 2 signed letters of intent at the end of the trade show on May 25. We started the project in October, using a traditional development approach (what we'd been doing for the last 2 years).<p>On Jan 15 or so, I got the group together and asked. 100% of the engineers agreed we had a <5% chance of even having a sales demo ready for the trade show. We were guaranteed not to have enough to get a sale.<p>So we were desperate and had, literally, nothing to lose (and no time to lose it in).<p>That was why we were so extreme. We measured the outputs that mattered to us (defects, long refactorings, output), and we reviewed our process each iteration. We did 1-week iterations (industry, as we learned later, was doing 3-4 weeks at the time). We continually developed qualitative heuristics and used our quantitative numbers to filter them on viability. We needed to know what would work faster than any quantitative approach could tell us.<p>And then we just tried all sorts of stuff. As we got more useful heuristics, they encouraged us to try more bizarre stuff. One of those heuristics was that learning was king: rate of progress == rate of invention == rate of learning stuff (techniques, domain knowledge, ideas that others on the team had).<p>That was what led us to try the very short pair swap times.<p>In the end, we stayed with them only because they worked. And man did they work.<p>5 years later, Ward & Jim convinced me to write up the experience for Agile 2005. Then a couple of other teams tried it.<p>Interestingly, many of them had exactly the same direct effects from the practice as we did - and those direct effects led to project failure, rather than success (Mitch's team & paper is a fine example).<p>On the basis of that, my current assumption is that you should only use PP if you're good at removing roadblocks and are already pretty low friction. PP makes all problems glaringly obvious all at once, and gives you the info & learning to address them. But if you can't address them quickly enough (or if there are too many friction points) it just destroys morale and productivity.<p>I now think of this as a 400-level practice.<p>First learn to pair (this takes time - it's a set of skills). Do stuff to improve feedback. Shrink all your cycles (we were shipping software 2x per day and hit 100% of our 1-week, 2-week, and 3-month commitments before we tried PP). Once you have eliminated that friction (we did it by fiat, since we were basically being laid off otherwise), then PP can be an awe-inspiring tool.",1332816860

3759771,comment,3759589,3759589,2,0,unimpressive,,,"1.) The average computer users fear of their own computer. It hurts me on a deep level (Deeper than just seeing a business opportunity.) to see the bicycle for the mind being marginalized in it's potential by people trying to sell things. (Microsoft, IBM, and co. Have probably done permanent damage to humanity by spreading the meme that computer knowledge is for 'nerds'. Whatever those are.) As we move further into the 21st century, and computers become ever more ubiquitous, it seems that computer knowledge becomes ever more scarce. (I'd have to run the numbers to be sure, but while the number of computer literate people has objectively gone up, I would think that the percentage of people with any sort of understanding deeper than the surface of point and click has gone down.)<p>I'm not even sure if it's a solvable problem. But if someone did it would be a great service to humanity.<p>2.) I'm 99% sure that this can't be solved by an external third party. But my 1% nagging doubt is enough to make me list it.<p>Quite simply, I have problems getting things done. It's not necessarily that I'm lazy, it's just that It takes more effort to figure out what I should be doing right now than it does to just keep procastinating on the same task. To-do lists help, but are ultimately inadequate. A pen and paper to-do list always seems to evade my attention when I try one. Writing it out in a text file usually works better, but it's still not a surefire thing. It's not necessarily that I need better <i>to-do list software</i> so much as it is that I need a better way to manage my time in a way that either:<p>A] I don't have to manually write down and erase tasks as I do them. Besides an erase shortcut I don't think that this is really feasible. Computers can't read my mind yet.<p>B]  It will make or convince me to habitually update and read it in such a way that it's not annoying or somehow feels out of sync with my workflow.<p>Maybe I'm alone on this one, maybe I'm not. Maybe it's solvable, but I doubt it.<p>I'd just like to remind anyone who's read this far that not every problem is best solved by a start-up or business. If you feel strongly about anything in this thread you should at least consider the possibility of other methods of achieving your goals.

Disabling updates allows you to stay at the current version (or, by enabling updates, go to the most recent version).  But you can't get any particular version.  Suppose I know that version 12.1.3.135 works perfectly for my internal application but that the current doesn't for some reason.  How do I get that version?  With versioned software this isn't so much of an issue, but with Chrome's continuous versions, it's a little harder.  And how would one roll that out to 10,000 users?  I'm sure it's not terribly difficult, but not as obvious as giving everyone Firefox 8.  And what happens when the CEO decides to enable updates and it breaks your web app?",1332815800

I'm talking about just the act of choosing which health care you should get and then keeping up with all the paperwork once you're sick. I've been outside of Canada for the past 12 years, but when I've gone to the doctor in the states for something as simple as stitches or a bad cold, I've always been amazed at how complicated it is in terms of bills and co-pays etc. I know that everyone things the system is so great, but I agre with you, it's not. It's ugly. People wait months for critical cat scans. Surgery is often cancelled or bumped. And patients regularly abuse the system rather than be proactive about their health. So in summary (sorry this got so long!!) neither system is perfect, but when I came to the states, I felt like I was just totally blind as I was choosing which insurance to get. I'd love to see someone fix the issue of helping people choose the right health care that's best for them, make best use of the FSA system, and manage bills / paperwork in a more efficient way.",1332815767

I'm not sure I agree; but the practical problem is: how to protect such a thing?<p>The legal system (patents, copyright); withholding secret sauce (closed-source webapp); or component in a larger system that's harder to copy, because of technical difficulty, commitment/resources; network effects (many users; mindshare)... or my favourite, continuously improving it faster than the copiers (like Apple).  Unfortunately, many things don't admit of improvement - they're ""done"" (as here); or copying is much faster than improving (as here).<p>You can do other things, like not target a technical audience that is able to copy it quickly (as here) - instead, target a mainstream audience, for whom the idea of copying it has no interest. A related, very dangerous, one is to stoke demand without satisfying it (as here) - this is one argument for serving every market (e.g. price point): not for maximizing profit or market-share, not even for being nice, but simply denying oxygen for a competitor to get a foothold (to mix metaphors).<p>Unfortunately, thinking about competition is quite machiavellian, and a long way from the work (and values) of actually creating something that's really cool.

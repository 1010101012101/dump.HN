These are, often, the same people who complain that they can't keep up with 100+ feeds in Google Reader either (and are incredulous that some of us maintain Inbox Zero :-)).<p>I think those people fear missing something. Mostly because I used to be in that group. With age, though, I realized a) that almost nothing is <i>that</i> important in the grand scale of life that it matters if I miss it, and b) if something is important, it'll bubble through another way anyway.",1282881501

1637932,comment,1634843,1634843,0,0,Flux61,,,"I'm a fan of the complete ingenuity of this entire concept. We've all seen and played the timeless smash and grab player-controlled games that have dominated our obsessions since Pong. However, in this day and age with video games becoming more and more complex, I love this simple idea. Instead of letting the player with the best reflexes, or an ability to seek out glitches in game play become the best, this concept attacks it from a completely different means. A game where creativity, humor, engineering, and street smarts all combine into one to form a brand new niche for gamers.<p>I've read all of the comments thus far and I have to say that I agree with many points on both sides. However, I would have to definitively say that if you want to control your player, this concept isn't for you. This is of course through the basic player moves that so many people are used to. Click A for jump, B for attack, different combo moves etc. Yes this appeals to many for great gaming, but I would argue that it is a gaming genre that may be at it's absolute peak. Even with today's most complicated games, there is a certain amount of creativity, street smarts and ingenuity in how you play the game.<p>What I love most about these arguments is that the creator (argued most notably for by dave_chenell) is telling you that you in fact DO have control over your character and the fight. It's just a higher level of control than one is used to. Basically, the 'player' gets to play 'god' in creating characters. By changing the slightest drawing, weapon accessory, and proportions (as is my understanding of this algorithm), one has complete control in how one should act in an all out brawl. If you want your gorilla to have great grappling moves, provide him with powerful arms, etc. I would argue that this feature gives complete control to the gamer.<p>This game type wouldn't be for anyone, that is certain. However, look at the massive amount of popularity games like Armadillo Run (<a href=""http://www.armadillorun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.armadillorun.com/</a>) have received. You don't have any control over the armadillo in this either. One must use their knowledge of physics, materials, and common sense in order to build a device to complete the objective, like a puzzle. This graFighters idea seems very similar; spend some time playing to learn how the game works, and it'll be just as addicting.<p>I understand that this concept isn't for everyone and it'll be tough to spread word to gamers who are willing to give it a shot based just on concept alone. But let me ask these gamers something. How many times have you been bored maybe in class or talking on the phone, and you doodle some complex robot. Maybe you give him a lightsaber for good measure. Wouldn't it be nice to put him to some use instead of tossing him away with your class notes?",1282880217

I guess it happens because there is no corporate redtape, infinite market sizing, or corporate apathy in a YC startup that exists in larger companies. I believe YC is much more efficient at turning ideas into products than large companies. Which is why I feel that YC can act as the fast throughway where the best and the brightest from google/ facebook etc depart temporarily for a year or two and return to the fold with a successful product. Large companies have a lot of policies meant to push the average employee up which end up holding their best employees back. Working in an autonomous setting within YC or another group would allow the best and the brightest from the larger companies to create products quickly.

Now, I was raised on good old normalization and all of that, but it doesn't mean that I'm a master at it. It's possible that there's a good way of relating this that I'm just overlooking. Or maybe I should have just denormalized it from the start.<p>Okay, so we have a domain object, Foo. Foos represent individual instances of a Foo that a user has, but we want to keep general information about the different standard types of Foo, so we also have a relation between Foos and FooTypes. Oh, and each FooType can have a few different sizes, and some FooTypes are the same sizes as each other, so we also need a FooSize. Not only do we need to relate the number of sizes that each FooType could have, but when a User has a Foo, we gotta know which sized one they have. All this stuff... it's complicated.<p>It probably would have been much easier for me to have just done each FooType up as a document, with an embedded array of sizes, and then each Foo gets a document, with its own copy of the data.

It doesn&#x27;t. Going from a completed cut that&#x27;s good enough to screen at a festival to a streaming deliverable in a great deal of work, and QCing it all is extremely time-consuming. It involves <i>weeks</i> of work for multiple specialists. Measuring compliance can be automated to a certain extent. Repairing defects cannot.

There&#x27;s blame all around, from consumers that are willing to skirt and outright break the law, to rights-holders that have time and again resorted to morally ambiguous contracts and actions with a consumer base that&#x27;s quickly coming to the conclusion they can&#x27;t always expect a fair deal[1].<p>That said, only one of these groups has any real power to make a change in the short term.  In the long term other possible solutions exist, such as through enacting new laws, but that seems to backfire as often as not given a enough time for the landscape to change yet again, so I don&#x27;t hold hope that a good solution will come out of that.<p>1: <a href=""http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/amazon-takes-away-access-to-pu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/amazon-takes-away-access-to...</a>",1411539395

But Bitcoin is in the opposite situation.<p>> The only difference with Bitcoin versus a small fiat currency is the people who are using it are distributed geographically worldwide instead of clumped together in one area.<p>So with a currency you can buy life essentials, with Bitcoin you can buy virtual things or things that are feasible to send through the post. I wonder what is going to be more valuable overall?",1411539274

When the company goes public the value of the shares soon drops to $20/share. What I thought was worth $500,000 is now worth just $200,000 (pre-tax). That&#x27;s a huge difference. Had the company&#x27;s shares been valued at $20 the time I was offered a position, I might have negotiated for more of them.<p>Now, to be fair, maybe salary plus $200,000 is still the best compensation package (and overall outcome) available to me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it was risk-free or cost-free.<p>As for the cost of purchasing 10,000 shares of Facebook stock outright, yes this is expensive. But you can easily establish a meaningful leveraged position through the use of options if you have the conviction. Also, keep in mind that this is precisely what employees do when they fail to sell their shares when they first have the chance. A Facebook employee who has $500,000 in newly-vested shares that can be sold, but who doesn&#x27;t sell, is in effect purchasing $500,000 in Facebook shares in the hopes that they will rise in price. If they fall in price, his or her loss is still very much a loss, even if it <i>looks</i> less painful because the shares were purchased with labor instead of cash.",1411538508

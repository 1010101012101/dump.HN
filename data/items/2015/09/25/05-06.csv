Idris is far from being production ready and or demonstrating it can be effectively used for real-workd programs. Even then, it still remains to be shown that such languages will be cheaper to use than validating the translation and still be performant enough for the purpose they&#x27;re used for (and, BTW, systems that require this level of correctness usually require proofs of timing and memory use -- including stack use).<p>[1] There is actually one such language -- Esterel. It (and its descendants) have been used to write safety-critical software successfully. It&#x27;s an incredible language, but it doesn&#x27;t translate well to other domains as it&#x27;s not Turing complete.",1443160771

Younger people just don&#x27;t watch TV conventionally much any longer. They may watch TV shows, but they do so using computing devices and the internet, not cable or broadcasts. The internet will only get better for that, and people will increasingly be abandoning conventional TV service.<p>More so when you consider that more and more of the highest quality and most popular video content has shifted away from the traditional model of regularly aired shows and schedule based content consumption to more plot driven content that is designed more for on-demand viewing. The shows people are watching the most and talking about the most are increasingly of the type that have fewer episodes per &quot;season&quot; and are more story driven. And many of the most popular shows today are only available online (House of Cards, Daredevil, House of Cards, Narcos, Sense8, etc.)<p>A lot of teens and younger folks aren&#x27;t even watching traditional television style content. They&#x27;re watching &quot;streamers&quot; and other video content on youtube.

It also has a bit more SDE and lower FOV so there&#x27;s a trade-off.<p>In terms of rendering pipeline, even w/ the latest Gameworks VR / Liquid VR drivers and WDDM 2.0, the GearVR may still beat out the PC&#x27;s latency - Carmack&#x27;s OC keynote from last year is worth watching for some of those details. Since the GearVR has both a direct kernel driver for the sensors and front-buffer access to the GPU, he quoted something eyepopping, like 4ms M2P latency.<p>IMO, the killer app for GearVR is watching movies on long trips, and the really compelling 360 photo/video content that&#x27;s starting to get made.

The possibility that two aircraft could get close enough that it would become a dogfight should always be accounted for.<p>Munitions could be expended to the point where no long-range missiles remain. An enemy aircraft could use terrain masking in mountainous terrain to get close; no radar can detect an aircraft through half a kilometer of rock. How about the effects of inclement weather? Or, perhaps, some F-35s are themselves using terrain masking on a ground-attack mission due to enemy SAM presence and are surprised by an enemy squadron.<p>The point is, there is always a way things can go wrong. Ignoring that gets people killed. That said, it has been accounted for in the F-35; the Distributed Aperture System along with off-boresight missiles could actually make the turning battle of a dogfight obsolete... until the F-35 expended all its missiles.<p>Of course a UAV could be much better than any manned aircraft in a dogfight; but battles aren&#x27;t always picked, one must always be prepared for a battle to be forced under less than optimal circumstances.",1443159091

It’s not so much that he’s thinking ‘move the right leg and than move the left leg’. What happens is that the computer system detects when the brain waves change from a state of not walking into a state of walking. When the computer detects that a person is walking, based on these brain waves, it turns on the electrical stimulator, which starts creating muscle contractions in the right leg first, and then the left leg; right leg, left leg. And then it keeps on doing this automatically until he stops thinking about walking, then it shuts it off and keeps him in a standing position.

However, while the mass grows geometrically with the size because of volume, the surface area of the panels only grows exponentially (x^3 vs x^2). Just like with single celled organisms: at some point the surface area can no longer absorb enough energy to support the massive machinery.<p>There are tricks to increase surface area but the panels still have to face the sun so you&#x27;re forced to make planes short vertically but very long horizontaly. I don&#x27;t think existing airports would be able to support such a different design.",1443157814

In that environment, a manned fighter, that cannot pull high-G maneuvers (because the human pilot will pass out) cannot beat a supersonic missile or drone.<p>We should not build planes to perform well in dogfights in the style of the Korean and Vietnam war.

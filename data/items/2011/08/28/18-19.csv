2934635,comment,2934581,2934581,18,0,bonzoesc,,,"> Cockpit component company Rockwell Collins, for example, made waves at this years Paris air show when it talked about developing a panic button for commercial airplanes that would give confused and stricken pilots the option of flipping a switch and letting the computer fly the plane to safety. Not surprisingly, the concept drew ridicule from aviators, who are quick to point out that computers are hardly infallible, as anyone who has ever struggled with a crashed Web browser knows.<p>One of the more dangerous things when operating a vehicle is cognitive overload; when shit goes wrong, a bunch of stuff tends to get dumped on you and you can't think fast enough to catch up. A way to let the airplane worry about itself for a minute while the pilots can catch up seems to be a decent way to address this side effect of being a conscious being instead of an automaton.<p>The jab about the unreliability of computers is just that; avionics software is on a much slower release schedule and has a much more fixed set of inputs than a web browser, allowing for a more thorough (or even formal) analysis of its behavior.<p>> People say its impossible to stall an Airbus, right? It has stall-protection systems and it wont allow you to exceed the maximum angle of attack where a stall would occur, argues Paul Strachan, an Air Canada pilot who is the head of the companys pilots union. But thats not true. If theres ice on the wing, that whole detection system isnt accurate to begin with. I would be pretty hesitant to get on a plane with no pilot.<p>Flight control systems can be built to compensate for all sorts of failures[1] that would pose grave difficulty for human pilots, but nobody's really advocating for completely-autonomous passenger planes. The problem right now is that the autonomous systems to reduce pilot workload and improve safety have failure modes that tend to overload the pilots with information. A working, reliable ""panic button"" would definitely help pilots get back in front of the plane in an emergency situation, but so would fixing the information overload to allow pilots to prioritize important issues (pitot freezing up, speed indicators unreliable) over side effects (unreliable stall warning, alternate law activation).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN9f9ycWkOY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN9f9ycWkOY</a>",1314557840

Too many to unpack.<p>One of them is that this ""men with guns"" phrase is often deployed to plant some kind of ""government over-reach"" meme around the most trivial of adult transactions, like paying parking fines and property taxes.<p>It betrays a childish political naivete.  The reason I say it's childish is that it's egocentric, as if the concerns of the speaker (to park where they want, to own large plots of land, that abut other people's land, without any consequence or restraint) were the only ones in existence.<p>That house is served by roads, protected by police and fire services, and must be in compliance with various perfectly reasonable regulations (like brush clearance).

The quantitive finance profession isn't exactly open and taking a constant influx of new ideas from the rest of the industry. They're a much more secretive bunch. Is it any surprise, then, that their tools stagnate somewhat because of their reluctance to engage openly with the rest of the industry?<p>I know that some people are engaged in high-speed trading applications where they require a language with a close analogue to machine instructions for the purposes of performance. I haven't seen any evidence that this is all quants everywhere, or that these suites of quantlibs actually provide all their functionality to that segment of the community.<p>Meanwhile, the CLR and JVM actually generate remarkably fast code from remarkably high-level specifications and LLVM is a real thing.

Outside the USA you can invest in more risky investments, (like canadian warrants often on companies small enough that we'd call them startups) ... but for the most part, I haven't.   It is a shame, because I would have liked to be an angel.  I'm very well aware of the risks involved.  I had a couple bad investments in the past where I lost an amount equivalent to an angel's part of a funding in the stock market... yet I can't risk the same amount in a startup? That's just wrong.<p>I do invest in the markets, I tend to do very aggressive options strategies.  I like to take something fundamentally sound or strong, and then use options to increase returns while reducing risk.  Specifically I use spreads.

I'm not quite certain that any other form of communication has ever been either freely available or remotely anonymous for anyone remotely like an average person.<p>What communications platform has it ever held true for?<p>1.) Telegraph -- cost money, not universally accessible, open, message assured to be read by at least 2 3rd parties.<p>2.) Mail -- costs money, need a registered address, handled by a quasi govt agency, can be read by 3rd party.<p>3.) Land line Telephone -- costs money, not universally accessible, requires registered address, every action is logged including recipient and duration.  Calls can be listened to by 3rd party.<p>4.) Cell Phones -- costs money, not universally accessible, burner can be had with no address or name.  Calls can be listened to by 3rd party.  Location tracking available.<p>5.) Home Internet -- costs money, not universally accessible, requires registered address, everything routed through ISP who keeps user logs, network that can intercept.<p>It's unclear to me why the service layer attracts so much attention, when the underlying network layer currently makes it largely impossible to have what you want for the average person.  Having anonymity at the service layer is almost confusing when the underlying framework guarantees it is largely not real.  There are all sorts of options already available at the service layer that can give all sorts of false appearances, many fewer at the network layer to make those false appearances turn real.  Twitter and Facebook and G+ are trivial issues in comparison to getting around the fact that backbone and access points are a network owned by 3rd party intermediaries (just as with all the previous communications platforms above).",1314556412

I have a blog on the same site (long story) and I have a couple of other sites that are old and rarely updated.  I have a parenting/homeschooling site and a health site. But I get reactions from people like I'm an effing messiah or something and they want me to save them, which is all kinds of trouble.  Messiahs end up dead (like crucified, burned at the stake, etc). Alternately, I get the crap kicked out of me by people who think I am a charlatan, because their problems are too hard to solve, all the experts say so.  This is apparently another means to get burned at the stake, not make money. Sigh. I'm good at solving personal problems -- real good -- and after much thought have concluded that there are two venues for that (for the ""wisdom"" schtick):  1) religion/personal messiah (no thanks) and 2) humor/entertainment.  So after much suffering over the strong reactions (both positive and negative) that I get out of people, I have decided to go into the humor/entertainment business.<p>There might some day be a product (a game) on one of my sites.  But for now, I would like to just get the comic going (trying to decide on the exact starting point in the story) and make enough money to get out of my day job.  Then other things can happen.<p>BTW: I happen to be 46 and am not the typical demographic for this site in other ways.  (I'm female, not a hacker, and so on.)<p>As for naming the forum:  I am actually hoping to at some point find someone who knows how to make money who will talk to me (probably via email) and help me figure that out.

Most people just have no clue.  They operate at a low level of awareness and understanding.  The ""Jay Walking"" segments that Jay Leno used to do illustrate this well.  Those are not stupid people, they just aren't aware.  To use another movie analogy, they're still plugged into the matrix.   Intrinsically, with becoming an entrepreneur is to disconnect yourself from the matrix a little bit.  You do want to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes because it is  very illuminating.  Don't look down on the people still plugged in.  The people who google for Facebook so that they can get on Facebook are the market. They're your customers and they may seem stupid, but they aren't.  They're just trapped in a narrower perspective than you have.  Most of them don't want to be freed.  Do your best to help them out with your products, but understand where they're coming from.<p>The thing about these different perspectives that is really profound is that people who are operating from a different perspective often don't even realize it.

A lot of so-called professional programmers could learn a thing or two from games developers about everything from writing high performance code to co-ordinating large development teams via the value of developing in-house tools to make development work more efficient.<p>But the games programmers are screwed by the simple fact that the market will accept games that are buggy/require insane hardware/etc. and pay for them, will usually not attempt to return them if they simply don't work but will rip them apart in on-line commentary if the game sucks, and will rip them off at the first opportunity if the game is cracked.<p>That means the business guys who are, quite rightly, calling the shots, are interested in basically the first few days after launch and nothing else. That in turn means there is no need to bother with things like code quality and long-term maintenance. Better to spend the money on a cinematic trailer and DRM that takes one more day to crack.<p>This will continue as long as people continue to accept buggy games, dubious policies like shipping incomplete games and then filling in the blanks with paid-for DLC, and so on.

(Timothy Vick's books on investing like Buffett are good here.)<p>- Everyone in the world think their country is special and unique.<p>- Get outside of the USA to see how different the world is from how it is portrayed within the USA<p>- Internationalize your products.  It isn't that expensive and you'll get most of your sales abroad<p>- Read ""Economics in One Lesson"".  Economics is really key.  Understanding it will give you amazing powers of prediction.<p>- People are the same everywhere, but also different.  Every new culture you live in, levels you up.  You'll be surprised at what you learn.  And going and living somewhere for 2 months is much better than the tourist thing.  You can get work done while you do it too.<p>- Never be involved in a franchise unless you're the one selling franchises.<p>- ""The Millionaire Fastlane"" is a hokey books, and written for seemingly the lowest common denominator, but it contains great wisdom.<p>- Atlas Shrugged is the most important book I've ever read.<p>- All capitalism works by enriching the lives of your customers.  The path to wealth is seemingly ""altruistic"" because it comes form improving other's lives.  They're inextricably intertwined.<p>- If 4 out of 5 businesses fail, start 6 businesses.<p>- 1 out of 5 businesses fail in my experience, 2-3 break even, and 1 does rather well.<p>- This one from fight club: ""Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!""<p>- And again: ""Only after disaster can we be resurrected.""<p>- The above two are very taoist / buddhist concepts.  You have to let go of you and see what the market says.  ""hitting bottom"" is getting to the point where you take in the response of the market to your product or your idea as the ultimate reality.... you have to let go of your idea that you have a clue what the market really wants.  Only after a product launch disaster can you be resurrected as an entrepreneur.   Or at least, it was something like that for me.  Stop trying to control everything, because doing so keeps you from hearing what the market is telling you.<p>- Always be Closing.  Ok, too many movie quotes, but they resonate with me.<p>- Always have a marketing strategy.  Have at least an idea of something that customers will stop and take notice of.  Something outrageous could be good- the Virgin method of promotion might work for you.   But you gotta be able to wake people up with just a handful of words that immediately resonate with them and make them go ""damn, I've been having that problem! Sign me up!""<p>- If you value the education you receive from failure, you can't lose in business.  That said, might as well go into it whole hog.  When you can't lose, it is impressive how much fear you can eliminate.<p>- Never start a business that costs more than $4,000 to get going (for the essence of the business. )  Never put in real money... it should either make money on its own right away, or if it requires some investment in technology, it shouldn't require any real capital. People are great at shopping and it is easy to rationalize a lot of spending... don't.<p>- Options, if properly used, greatly reduce investment risk, while also boosting returns.  Stock options (calls and puts) are the least understood investment vehicle among the mainstream.<p>- I never spent money on a book, including a $90 ""Due Diligence"" book that I barely ever read, that didn't pay for itself many times over, on topics such as investing, business and marketing.  Even the bad ones were worth many times the cover price.<p>I'm sure a lot of that is obvious... maybe I'd be better talking about specific topics or sharing specific experiences.",1314554781

The check box should have a date.  &quot;I agree to your terms of service (last modified on 10/11/12)&quot;\n2.  Break your TOS into sections by usage.   For example, &quot;when growing our site&quot;, &quot;when you create an account&quot;, &quot;when you post a comment&quot;, &quot;when you make a purchase&quot;.\n3.  Usually, write your TOS yourself, in plain language.  Then take it your IP attorney and have them mark up what&#x27;s wrong.  It saves you money and provides a more friendly and readable TOS.

Inherently preferring one over another isn&#x27;t rational. Charities incentivise participation through altruism and the promise of political access. Corporations through self-interest and power. Corporations can make water pumps as easily as charities can find frivolous ends. If we are saying charities are less efficient than corporations, that is one thing.<p>I think the statement is more about time horizons. Governments and foundations have long inherent time horizons. But short electoral and fund-raising cycles turn them myopic. Charities, similarly, must raise funds on an on-going basis. This makes them, on average, more short-sighted than even corporations. Particularly corporations backed by horizon-seeking visionaries such as Elon. Page is not denigrating the work of charities <i>per se</i>. He is observing that today is being kept at the expense of tomorrow. The portfolio deserves balancing, and the best way to do that, he thinks, is through long-viewed companies.",1395352397

Could we allow users to modify the TOS for themselves and have a quick round of TOS negotiation?<p>Yes, for a large enough price.   In most cases, the cost of having anyone even acknowledge a new customer means that customer is unprofitable.   Quicken (Intuit) was the poster child for recognizing that a customer ever asking for customer support was unprofitable.  Usually, a minor round of contract negotiation for a $50K product happens, and always happens for contracts greater than $250K.<p>2.  Can we ask the user why they balked at the TOS?  If there are enough common reasons for balking we might change the TOS.<p>Yes, absolutely.   Lawyers I work with often complain about products, some aimed at lawyers, that don&#x27;t understand the diligence implications of &quot;we may change these terms without notice&quot;.   Any lawyer placing client confidential information on any service with this clause is failing their legal duty to take reasonable measures to protect attorney-client privileged information.

Failing to establish a reasonable migration strategy was a bad <i>business</i> decision likely rooted in bad <i>engineering</i> management that fell out of starting with <i>bad technical decisions</i>.<p>It&#x27;s much harder to hire people that can pull you out of a mess like PHP when, at the same time, you have to hire people that can keep writing PHP for you.<p>> <i>That the initial team didn&#x27;t rewrite Facebook in Python/Perl/Ruby/Haskell during the fast growth phase?</i><p>That would have been a good time to bring on new engineering blood as part of scaling out, which would have provided opportunities to enact mitigation and transition strategies. Imagine if the massive amount of talent currently devoted to HHVM had been devoted to Facebook&#x27;s actual business?<p>There are migration strategies other than &quot;rewrite everything immediately&quot;, and in fact, I&#x27;d bet that&#x27;s exactly what HHVM is. It&#x27;s just a shame they waited so long that the most cost-effective migration strategy was to tackle an enormously difficult computer science and engineering problem that the world&#x27;s biggest software companies already invest hundreds of millions of dollars on and provide to the world largely for free.<p>> <i>If you have ever experienced the growth phase, you understand how ludicrous the idea of rewrite would be.</i><p>Yes, and I&#x27;ve also (repeatedly) been the team brought in to rewrite the mess of a code base that was about to <i>torpedo</i> the growth phase.<p>There&#x27;s not much correlation between funding, initial success, and engineering talent. Which is why you so often wind up with a mess that has to be cleaned up once you can hire people who know what the hell they&#x27;re doing, instead of the ones you happened to be stuck with because you didn&#x27;t know how to grow an engineering team.<p>> <i>We underestimate how much hidden wisdom a production code base has and that the messiness is often there for good reasons.</i><p>Messiness is never there for good reasons other than that replacing it is more expensive than not touching it.

Your point about a poorly designed SOA being an equally poorly designed app is well taken, but I think it&#x27;s more work to design a good SOA than a good monolithic app.  And this is where the effort of designing the interface comes in.<p>In a monolithic app interfaces can be more fluid because you can have automated tests and static analysis and compile time checks verifying that a given change works.  That means you can prototype and iterate faster while the business requirements may still be churning considerably.  To realize the benefits of an SOA you need a much more stable interface and some way to handle validation and correctness of the wire protocol.  If you do it right and come up with a stable interface, you gain the benefits of decoupling system administration, scalability, and even development to a great extent.  But if you do it wrong you end up a lot more work for an equivalent business logic architecture, and if you don&#x27;t have any scaling issues than the cost-benefit is likely not to be there.<p>My rule of thumb about whether an SOA is a good idea to pursue at a given point in time is much more related to the team size than the nature of the app.",1395351465

You can make the exact same people with the same effort generate order(s) of magnitude more wealth per year by making different products, making the same products more efficiently, or combining people with capital(=machinery, automation, economies of scale).\nThird, trade generally creates wealth as such.

And second, if you &quot;give a fish&quot; to kids&young adults, then that enables them to &quot;learn fishing&quot; and generate more wealth in the future instead of being stuck in  ineffective menial jobs (that don&#x27;t generate much wealth for them nor their employers) from early childhood till death.",1395350492

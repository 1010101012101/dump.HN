Then I got introduced to C which made me realize what studying computers is all about. Then I got to know Unix and Linux. I still remember the day I got my Unix login. I was the first student to get one! My college projects (Linux clusters, routers), my geek friends, my first job and my professional life - all got started by learning C & Unix in a remote university lab thousands of miles away.

Artificial intelligence has been around since the dawn of computers (think Clippy), helping us do our shit. In fact, AutoCAD is a bunch of 'artificial intelligence' that's letting you draw vectors and write code in a more intuitive way (ok, not exactly and technically, but you know what I mean)<p>It seems like the author of this article has never in their life seen a computer do anything more than push numbers, but machine learning and AI have been around for at least a decade. This is just a very mainstream case of very well developed AI.<p>Saying that 'this is the start of a revolution' is not only ill-advised, but totally baseless. What's the innovation? What has changed in what was previously possible? For a revolution to occur, there needs to be an innovation that causes expansion of technological capabilities. Although Siri is (supposedly) great, it does not represent an expansion of technological capability. Just because the team behind Siri spent years building out a great voice activated AI system does not mean that we all can now do it. Computers have not become smarter... they are the same as they ever were. People have not realized a more efficient way to create AI... it's the same as before.<p>I'm truly surprised that such a shallow and misguided article made it to the popular page in a community like this.",1318600312

Uh, all the ""A.I."" is doing is googling it. So basically Siri will use speech-to-text (which I've had on my Android phone for years) and put it in the google search box for me. Then it will read the first result. Zippity-doo-da.<p>""We will teach it how to use Excel.""
Can you possibly imagine trying to <i>tell</i> a speech recognition system to input into a spreadsheet? Quite a step backwards, if you ask me.<p>Look, the interpretation of language into meaning and then into commands has been around for a while, and it's been constantly improving. Siri is another product in that crowded market. It's really swell that they included it in iOS; like I said, I've had it on my Droid for two-plus years and it's pretty handy.

And it's async in core and by rule, thus nodejs modules are async too, yet no async-motto is coupled with Python, so it's much harder to get async-ready libs suiting Tornado. Therefore COTS-wise NodeJS is actually also a better solution.<p>But in the end the most important thing is whether you're more familiar with Python or JavaScript and which solution will be more productive for you. Unless you're going for really large scale project and want to shorten your time by using existing modules, Tornado is obviously as good as NodeJS.<p>Loosely relevant: <a href=""http://amix.dk/blog/post/19484#Comet-with-node-js-and-V8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amix.dk/blog/post/19484#Comet-with-node-js-and-V8</a>",1318598529
3111037,comment,3110025,3110025,5,0,jarek-foksa,,,"I find libraries such as Require.js to be too complicated to trust them.<p>I put all my client-side JS files into ./src directory and watch them with Node.js server. When any file in ./src is added or modified then server automatically copies it to ./build directory and wraps it with additional code required by module loader.<p>This way I can use (almost) the same syntax for handling modules on both client- and server-side, e.g. I can write client-side script which looks like this:<p><pre><code>  var button = require('widgets/button.js').button;
  var toggleButton = Object.extend(button, {
    label: 'Toggle me',
  });
  exports.toggleButton = toggleButton;
</code></pre>
And it will automatically get compiled into:<p><pre><code>  'use strict'; module('widgets/toggleButton.js', function(exports) {
    var button = require('widgets/button.js').button;
    var toggleButton = Object.extend(button, {
      label: 'Toggle me',
    });
    exports.toggleButton = toggleButton;
  });
</code></pre>
The client-side framework for handling such modules takes 28 lines of code: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1287050"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1287050</a><p>Unless you are writing really large apps, this approach seems to be much cleaner, just remember to combine and minify all modules before deployment.",1318598507

For example, for SN 1987A the FTL neutrino event would have preceded the visible light neutrino event by <i>over four years</i>.<p>They could go through all of the old data, to be sure, but they would have to specifically have had to be looking for something which they think fundamentally is impossible in order to find something like this.

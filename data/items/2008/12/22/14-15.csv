Perhaps the canonical example of this is naive set theory itself - paradoxes were discovered, but set theory was interesting enough that mathematicians looked for alternate definitions that did not contain the paradoxes, and they succeeded.<p>There are two things to note here. First, axiomatization was a useful tool in distinguishing various types of set theory and defining the ones that did not contain the (known) paradoxes. Second, the full formal treatment of these set theories came relatively late to mathematics, as did widespread use of formal, axiomatic methods in general. Rigorous axiomatic formalisms are very useful mathematical tools, but mathematics got along without them for a long time (not even Euclid counts, by modern standards) and can do so again if necessary. It is unlikely that this will happen, not because axiomatics can be proved to always work or because mathematics cannot get along without it, but because it is too useful a tool to abandon easily.<p>This was really Godel's point: mathematics is not identical with formalism. They stand and fall separately. This is not to say that mathematics could never collapse for any reason, only that it would take a lot more than finding a paradox at the center of ZFC to make it happen.",1229957947

But I disagree with the statement that Sarbanes-Oxley is killing entrepreneurship, so I'd like to hear comments about that from the entrepreneurs here. I'm also not sure that it is a sign of failure that many start-ups sell themselves to an existing big company rather than doing an IPO. It seems to me (again I would like to hear from the entrepreneurs here about this) that the whole point of starting a start-up is to have FLEXIBILITY to decide later how to cash out the business. Some like to sell to one company, some like to sell shares to the public at large, and some stay closely held for a long time. To each their own, methinks.",1229957664

406394,comment,405557,406361,0,0,kragen,,,"<i>I keep saying this, there is more to computing than websites.</i><p>I'm aware of that; I wasn't suggesting that people should be programming their websites in Verilog, after all.  But running websites <i>is</i> part of computing.<p><i>I completely concede your point that F#/OCaml/FP in general has little to offer when it comes to serving up web pages more quickly.</i><p>That wasn't my point; I think functional programming might have a lot to offer when it comes to serving up web pages more quickly, and especially programming web-server software more easily.  My point was that functional programming doesn't have a lot to offer when it comes to making your code more parallel.<p><i>Formatting records from a database for display on a client device isn't all that different since the 80s anyway.</i><p>I cannot imagine in what sense this sentence could be true.  The database architectures, the languages used, the required level of efficiency, the CPU architectures, the scale of operations, the kinds of failure we expect from components, the structure of the machines (then SMP mainframes, now shared-nothing clusters of thousands of computers), the type of people doing it, the client devices, the networks, the formatting, and the nature of the data have all changed dramatically since the 80s.<p><i>I care about, for example, people not trying to do Monte Carlo work in Java because that's the organization's ""standard"" language. A language like F# that it is acceptable to use in a large organization with arbitrary standards made by non-technical people is a huge deal.</i><p>Do you think doing Monte Carlo work in Java is bad?  Because of performance?  Last I heard, the optimizations in the CLR's JIT were pretty minimal, while the Java JITs had pretty much reached parity with GCC and were breathing down icc's neck.  (What Fortran compilers do people use these days?)  Maybe you should get excited about people doing Monte Carlo work in Scala instead?<p>Anyway, whether a language is pleasant to program in or has a good compiler has very little to do with whether it helps you take advantage of available hardware parallelism â€” unless the way in which the compiler is good is that it auto-vectorizes your loops or supports HPF directives or something.  As far as I know, F# and Java are equally abysmal at that.",1229957466

It <i>is</i> possible to prove the consistency of arithmetic, but to do so you must use an even more complex system of axioms whose consistency can itself only be proved with an even more complex system, and so on.<p>So strictly speaking, the theorem doesn't rule out consistency proofs, but it does rule out proving the consistency of complex systems by simpler systems, meaning that the consistency of the consistency proofs can't be trusted any more than the consistency of the original system!",1229956270

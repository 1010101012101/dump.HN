I think people just don't want to waste the time searching for an answer, when they are seeing a perfectly good suggestion already posted. It takes a lot of time to find a good suggestion, so the users just don't want to bother, unless they know they can make a difference.<p>Pretty much the only times I've seen a 4th answer, is when a person starts out their reply with ""all of those other choices suck, here is my recommendation""<p>Or it could be because the site is just starting out, and a year down the line, you'll be able to get 20 different suggestions...time will tell",1259189837

But once you drop down to the 0 mark, it's a different matter entirely (certainly, naive calculations of value break down). Even if you charge for your far superior product, you will have 
difficulty competing with an inferior free product.<p>The only real strategy here is to target a niche audience who's needs can't be satisfied with the free product. Many web services take this approach by offering both a free version (for the masses) and a premium one (for the hardcore users), while some solely target the niche (e.g. Smugmug).<p>But targeting a niche really means that you really aren't competing for the same users as the free product.",1259189534

Regardless of whether their conclusions are right or wrong, they are doctoring numbers to fit their desired conclusions and sidelining scientists who raise doubts.<p>As scientists and engineers this <i>should</i> disgust us.  The sanctity of the scientific process is a much bigger deal than climate change.  It embodies all our technological decisions and it cannot be tainted.<p>It would be as if the supreme court was burying evidence to convict people they thought were guilty.  It's wrong.  Even if we think it achieves the right result.  Once you lose faith in the system, it ceases to be useful.",1259187389

Virtually no one uses clojure, so hiring and training are different, etc.  You've incurred a lot of overhead for something not that great.<p>The best tool for this job was to improve the Ruby version by way of C extensions, or write a new C command that does this work for you, linking in the Git and SVN code directly.

4038041,comment,4037799,4037984,7,0,jwr,,,"In my code, there are two kinds of places where I get a performance boost by using Clojure:<p>1. Micro-optimizations, mostly due to JVM and its excellent JIT (the garbage collectors are quite impressive, too, if what you need is predictable response time).<p>2. Architectural gains: thanks to the Clojure's excellent concurrency support I can make much better use of multiple cores. I get more parallellism, hence better performance on same hardware.<p>The first kind is cool, because you get it ""for free"". The second kind is the real game-changer, because non-parallel software only gets you so far in terms of performance, and writing concurrent software is Hard. Clojure makes it much, much easier.<p>But overall I wouldn't say that Clojure is a performance daemon on a single CPU. You can get performance similar to carefully written Java code. This is good, but you can always do better with C or hand-written assembly on critical sections. But that's not the main advantage: the big thing is that I can write correct Clojure code <i>fast</i>, it runs well enough, and I can easily make use of multiple cores. You can debate micro-benchmarks all you want, but what really counts for me is how quickly (and correctly) I can get from zero to production code that runs fast enough.",1338306779

In a city like London or Paris, a pedal cycle is faster than a car for most journeys. In a city like LA, a motorcycle can be twice as fast as a car during rush-hour.<p>This has effects beyond the two-wheeled rider; Remember, you're never stuck in traffic, you <i>are</i> traffic. A recent study suggested that if 10% of car drivers switched to two-wheeled vehicles, congestion would reduce by 40%[1]. Currently, riders of motorcycles are at an exceptionally high risk of death or serious injury. A fully enclosed two-wheeler could be every bit as safe as a car.<p>There are also substantial efficiency savings to be made, due to the C1's very small frontal area. A faired two-wheeler with a recumbent seating position is naturally very close to the aerodynamically ideal dolphin-shape. A four-wheeled vehicle could only achieve similar aerodynamic efficiency by being very long and low, with single or tandem seating, as in the Volkswagen 1L concept[2] or Shell Eco-Marathon competitors. This substantially compromises visibility and turning circle, making such a vehicle very poorly suited to its obvious use as an urban commuter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.acem.eu/publiq/PTW_Belgium_Study_FEBIAC_ENG.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acem.eu/publiq/PTW_Belgium_Study_FEBIAC_ENG.PDF</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car</a>",1338306217

When I was training the model, it was just easier to get it to do things squeezing parts of my face.<p>That being said, I wonder if this shortcoming is more on the user. Their userbase are hobbyist and dabblers who have grown up with the explicit knowledge that you CAN'T move something with your mind (this is an entirely unsupported thought).<p>Instead of training just being 'think about moving the box', you could look into techniques like phantom hand therapy. Have the user go through a similar session where the application tries to elicit a response similar to the therapy as a way to get them to start manifesting a better response (maybe mix it with the visualization techniques athletes use) for training. While not optimal, have the user physcially do something X times, then make them visualize doing it.<p>Like I said, I think the problem is more in the user than the hardware (I've never had a problem w/ the Emotiv). If someone comes along with a better training method, then this would certainly help.<p>Lastly, I don't think neuromuscular training is entirely a bad thing. It lessens the 'ooo' factor of controlling something with your mind and alienates people who'd actually want to use this (quadriplegics), but as an able-bodied person, I see no reason not to be able to use them.",1338305721

It started out complex and then got simple over time. Which screws up user expectations -- the people who were attracted to it when it was complicated aren't going to be people put off by complexity. So they may have felt misled a bit when the complex product they chose started becoming something else.<p>In other words, when he decided after launching FeedDemon that what it should have been was a simpler product, Bradbury might have been better off if he'd left the ""FeedDemon"" name on the original, complex product and then rolled out the simpler version under a different name. That way people who picked up ""FeedDemon"" wouldn't feel like they were getting pushed into using ""SimpleDemon"" (or whatever the streamlined version ended up getting called) instead. People underestimate the power of names in setting user expectations.<p>(An objection to this might be the increased difficulty of maintaining two product lines, but there's a simple answer to that -- just stop updating FeedDemon. Eventually the power users who appreciate the simplicity will get the message and switch over to SimpleDemon, and those who ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE radio button #7,131 on the preferences screen can sit on their complicated, orphaned version for life.)",1338305659

4037890,comment,4037447,4037447,4,0,kevinlu310,,,"Facebook's advertising model is a simple classical displaying advertising model. It need be disrupted seriously. Nowadays, the most popular marketing model is displaying advertising model, which is actually an attention-driven marketing model. However, no matter how good they are context-awared and personalized, they are always guesswork, which can hardly achieve high relevancy. It is extremely difficult to guess users actual intention for most cases, even you may have a lot of information of them. For example, it is super difficult to guess what an individual is exactly looking to buy when he walks into a Trader Joes, no matter how much information you obtained on him, like his income, profession, age, education and etc. Users intentions are always dynamically changing from time to time. There are no general equations that can perfectly predict peoples intentions. As a result, no matter how perfectly a system can attract attentions, attention-driven marketing can never achieve high efficiency and accuracy.<p>As a matter of fact, nowadays advertisement industry is the biggest bubble of the world. Every year, trillions of dollars completely wasted by irrelevant advertising unnecessarily. What is even worse is, the user experience is badly hurt by ads and spams. Such marketing system can be called as attention-driven marketing system. Everything is done to attract attentions. However, only a few attentions are really attracted, but majority of the attentions may not be finally turned into intentions. As a result, majority of the marketing costs are totally wasted.<p>The future marketing systems will be built on intentions. Intention-driven commerce systems need let every user to express his/her intentions freely and help him/her achieve his/her intentions in highly optimized way by socialization and crowd-sourcing. The future world needs to be a world without displaying ads, but only pure relevant information that matches users' intentions dynamically and real-timely. This is the very objective of my current startup project as well.",1338305103

By purchasing something you're changing ""who"" you are from the perspective of an advertiser (e.g. a Chevy driver could become an Audi driver).<p>So Facebook has a great picture of ""who"" each user is at a the moment, but no real way of knowing ""who"" each user would like to become or when.

It's generally a strategy I approve of.<p>Even dropping 20% since the IPO (currently trading at just over $30 as I write this; and bear in mind that even <i>Groupon</i>--at least initially--enjoyed a nice IPO bounce), the company is trading at a huge P/E ratio.<p>I get why this is: it's speculative. FB is still viewed as a growth company and the speculators feel that there is huge unrealised monetization potential.<p>I remain a skeptic regarding the value of ""social"" in advertising. The OP is right: all this data just means--maybe--a slightly higher CTR, at which point Facebook is just another display ad network and that doesn't justify their valuation.<p>As an aside, IMHO Twitter is in this same ""put up or shut up"" boat. I don't believe Facebook is doomed (IMHO Twitter is). I just believe the value of the data silo they have is both overstated and transitory (at some point--one way or the other--Facebook won't be the gatekeeper to your profile and social graph).<p>Facebook has done a lot of things right as a business (the Like button being foremost among those IMHO).

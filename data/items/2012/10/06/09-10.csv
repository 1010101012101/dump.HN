This help cut down false positives in situations like<p><pre><code>   if (p == NULL)\n       fatal_error();\n   *p = 0;\n</code></pre>\nWith the inference-based analysis we did in PREfix, if we don't recognize fatal_error() as a function that's likely to exit the program, we'd report a potential NULL pointer on the next line.  But we didn't have the source code for fatal_error, how could we possibly know that?  Ideally it would be a volatile function but a lot of older code is very sloppy about that.  So we employed various heuristics based on the names of the functions (and gave the user an opportunity to tune the results) ... it worked surprisingly well in practice.",1349516112

That's a subtle point, and it wouldn't happen on every forum.<p>That said, I recognize that such meta discussions can be a little derailing, and I don't want to derail this discussion any further - so I'll just leave it at ""let's not be a place that discourages new people from asking questions"".",1349516050

Teams of programmers are often involved in developing class libraries and specializing existing class libraries.

Weve been working hard to get back to everyone and we thank you for your patience  were bringing in some help so we may answer your questions more quickly.<p>As we noted yesterday, we have gone far past the original 1,000 Lockitrons we intended to make in the first run. We have been very careful to hold off from selling Lockitron in bulk or wholesale quantity to ensure that individual backers have a chance to get in.<p>Weve been in touch with our manufacturing partner, and to ensure that we satisfy all the backers who have supported us already in a timely fashion, we are going to restrict the first batch of Lockitrons to 9,000 units. Were planning to start shipping batch 1 in March. Once batch 1 fills up, we will open up pre-orders for batch 2. (Edit: batch 1 is now full. We have just opened pre-orders for batch 2.)<p>It will take us a few days to get a more accurate quote for the new production times, however we dont anticipate batch 2 to begin shipping before May.<p>In the coming weeks we will be posting new pictures and videos of the Lockitron mechanism in action. Weve had a lot of questions about compatibility - of course, if you discover that your door is unfortunately incompatible with Lockitron you can cancel your reservation.<p>--8<---<p>[1] <a href=""http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=blog.lockitron.com%2fpost%2f32927907961%2fproduction-updates&d=348495168431&w=4e238952,391779c8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=blog.lockitron.com%2fpost%2...</a>",1349514733

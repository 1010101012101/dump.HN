A successful city needs two major things: ready access to water and ready access to trade. That's why most major cities are on rivers or around major harbours.<p>Take my home town Darwin, for example. It is not destined to be one of the world's great cities because it is poorly positioned. There's buckets of water but due to the flatness of the country it's hard to dam. The harbour is large but shallow. The approaches from East and West are not friendly to bulk shipping.<p>Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth are already hogging the best spots for large cities.",1295920765

Two years later someone comes and says, remember dev X, Y, and Z.  They were using some GPL code in your project.  We've found at least 50 instances of it.<p>Now here's where it gets ugly, because everyone who picked up your project thinking it was a BSD project, just picked up a GPL project.  They may be using your code in very intertwined, fully in compliance with the BSD license, but you must now inform them that the must comply with the GPL or cease using this code, or pay damages.<p>That doesn't seem like a great situation to be in.<p>Although it is ironically a good argument for the GPL...

   Application acceleration engineers work with client applications 
   to deliver order of magnitude speedups. You'll be involved 
   in every stage of accelerating applications, from analyzing 
    multi-million line code bases through developing new algorithms,
    to implementing complete solutions running on FPGA, GPU, or 
    other technologies. We are in the early stages of growing and 
    building up the Palo Alto office, so you'll be part of a very 
   small team working in a start-up-like environment.

   You will need a degree or equivalent professional qualification 
   in Computer Science or a related discipline as well 
   as experience in some of the following:

    * » High performance software development in C/C++ or FORTRAN.
    * » Program analysis and transformation
    * » Compiler design and implementation
    * » Computer architecture / digital circuit design.
    * » Working with scientific software code in HPC application 
        domains such as computational finance, seismic processing, 
        life sciences or fluid dynamics.

The angles between the eyes and the focusing power of the lens differ minimally once you get several meters away on out to infinity. From several meters to your nose, yes, heaps of variance is required and it would be very hard to do.<p>This is just Ebert being an idiot and saying ""This is my opinion, stated as fact, case closed. I won't enter into any discussion because I might be wrong"", just like he said when he declared video games weren't art. It is /profoundly/ unscientific to dismiss something as unfactual simply because you don't like it.<p>Back in the day, my honours degree was specifically involved in investigating ocular vergence (research jargon as 'angle between the eyes' as opposed to the /action/ of converging), comparing between a collimated image (= light coming to the eye in 'parallel' - from a military helicoptor pilot's HUD) and a real image (= light coming in 'non-parallel') displayed at 3m. At that distance there is already not much difference between focusing or vergence at 3m and at infinity (ie collimated), though discrepancies slightly increase as you move towards the periphery of your vision, though this may have been an artifact of the presentation of the HUD.<p>I am not an expert in 3D and don't proclaim it to be 'there yet'. I do think that 3D is doable if the director stops the temptation of the 'power' closeup to showoff the 3D. So yeah, I think within constraints, 3D is doable. All film has constraints though, and those constraints are gradually eroded over time - such as night-time filming. Fifty years ago we would have heard Ebert proclaiming that it's impossible to film in natural light at night because film needs a certain amount of light, case closed, yet we've seen some amazing cameras arrive recently that can film at night using natural light.<p>EDIT: Another example constraint is limiting yourself to a 'viewing box' - you can't turn your head for a full view of the scene in a movie. You're limited to a particular forced view. Despite this rather incredibly limiting constraint, film has managed to do some pretty amazing stuff.",1295918735

Not that I think any calendar software out there now is particularly nice to use, but that's a different issue (though it may be the cause of the first).<p>USE CALENDAR SOFTWARE.  The problem goes away.  Just share links, overlay, and look for gaps in the method of your choosing.<p>More on topic: entirely disagree.  Which is more annoying: me listing off time after time after time that of course is unlikely to fit into their clearly-busier schedule, or asking if they have free time soon?  Prior to getting a job, I could just start asking about hour after hour, endlessly, until they say yes, or I could say ""any day, between midnight and midnight"".<p>If <i>your</i> schedule is busier than theirs, yes, it's rude, because you'll have to say ""no"" a whole lot.  That's rude because it's a waste of time.  But when you're trying to meet up with ""(potential customers, investors, biz dev partners, employees, journalists)"", ie, people you probably will take time out of your day to deal with, offering them the choice is closer to a compliment, as you're basically saying they're more important than you.",1295918001

You haven't refuted the logical premise of the article in any meaningful way. This isn't a smoking gun refuting the point of the article.<p>The fact is that inadvertent infringement, such as someone copy/pastes a few lines of code from GPLed code without awareness of its origin, does <i>not</i> impose a requirement on the entire work. It merely means you either rewrite the offending code (call it ""stolen"", ""borrowed"", ""misplaced"", ""inadvertently copied"", whatever you want), obtain the code under a different license from the original author (this is entirely plausible, and I've sold licenses in the past in this way on code I held the copyright to and licensed under the GPL), disable that feature, stop distributing the code entirely, or whatever you want to do. You simply are not forced to GPL your code, and it's FUD to suggest that a license would somehow force you to do so.<p>I'm not saying the article is the best written or most coherent defense of the GPL ever, but its primary premise is correct.

The FPS &quot;model&quot; was a great way to translate realistic environments to flat, 2d screens but the typical run-and-gun style of FPS is just terrible in VR.  Every time I read about these elaborate workarounds (omni-treadmills and the like) I can&#x27;t help but think that people are missing the point and trying to shoehorn what works in 2d into the VR realm.<p>I get that FPS-style games seem like perfect contenders for VR since they are already pretty realistic and immersive for 2d constructs.  Still, the conventions of FPS evolved to fit the flat world of computer monitors and TV screens.  Once you&#x27;re immersed, running around can be quite nauseating even if you&#x27;re experienced with VR or have a decent resistance to VR motion sickness.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in trying out (and building) new conventions that are a natural fit for VR.  Seated experiences and, eventually, ones that allow for walking around 1:1 in the room you&#x27;re actually in will beat running around with a controller while looking through a HMD.",1441807056

New peers that try to fetch the new content at some IPNS name would see a new IPFS object hash, and search the DHT for that new hash. Nodes that have an old version won&#x27;t be involved (unless of course the object &#x27;hierarchy&#x27; contains cached data, which will only speed things up). At first the only peer having the new content will probably be the creator, but this will quickly spread across the network.<p>As long as peers do not decide to keep the data (by pinning the hash), the old content will simply be deleted and replaced with new content. Pinning is extremely cheap, so you can imagine that you would want to auto-pin pages as you visit them. This is not on by default though, and I think that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>> [B]ut without a central management how does IPFS associate correct file to the correct hash?<p>It does so using cryptographic identities. In IPFS every peer has a private/public keypair, and the PeerId is the hash of its public key. When publishing content under an IPNS name (which always has the PeerId at its root), you must prove that you &#x27;own&#x27; the PeerID by signing the object with your private key. Other nodes will not &#x27;mirror&#x27; your IPNS object unless the signature matches (which makes a nice consensus).<p>The paper calls this self-certified names: you can distribute the objects, and let them be provided by third parties without losing authenticity.

It featured an &quot;IBM Insights&quot; segment which claimed to have mined 8 years worth of Majors competitions to generate stats. And one interesting result it was able to produce went something like this: if Djokovic is able to return only 25% of his opponents serves, then in 85% of past matches it has resulted in victory for him. The implication being that such is the strength of his defensive game.<p>While this is no doubt really interesting, I find I am getting diminishing returns from outputting stats like this from big dumps of past historical data. What I would like to be able to show is a live heat graph style stats tracker, where each point in the match updates my belief net about who is winning, or playing better. Of course, the final outcome may be upended by some fluke occurrence such as a Hail Mary pass in the final seconds which is what makes sports interesting, but nonetheless I think a live tracker would say a lot more than the actual score of the match.<p>So, I am wondering if anyone has specific resources for real time online data mining? At web scale for high throughput data streams. And I agree with shubmajain above, libraries and repos are preferable to books and academic journals ;)",1441804967

This is a thought experiment, obviously.<p>Her neighborhood will have a slightly lower standard of living than her clone because the residents have no where to park, are not a cultural fit with the neighborhood, their voting patterns and motivations are not the same as their neighbors or are otherwise screwing up carefully gerrymandered districts (WRT funding local schools or police, for example).<p>Also there are likely zoning issues based on old laws, for example maybe the zoning laws somehow prohibit my long dead great grandfather from running a small accounting practice or a yoga studio next door by banning retail traffic, but somehow they&#x27;re skirting the zoning laws by sneakily not allowing retail traffic or visitors or some other cheaty hack of the local zoning laws.  This will also make her life a living hell when the zoning laws are inevitably changed to permit the outsiders and suddenly neighbor X is screaming because neighbor Y used the new loosened rules to sneak in an autobody repair business and is legally running a weld grinder at 2am every night and neighbor Z is dumping waste from his home electroplating business in his backyard.<p>Now she can&#x27;t go out in public and start whining that she doesn&#x27;t want to do work and take risks in exchange for the same salary she got for doing basically nothing, like in the past.  And she can&#x27;t whine in public about how they screwed up the perfectly gerrymandered districts.  And she can&#x27;t whine in public about cultural fit because we tolerate, even encourage, that in business but in public thats just old fashioned racism, whatever-ism, etc, and that doesn&#x27;t fly in public.  But she can go in public and rant about how &quot;they hate us because we cling to our God and our guns&quot; and &quot;they hate us because they&#x27;re rich&quot; or whatever.  So she&#x27;s a bundle of hate and anger but all she can say in public about it is babble.<p>So from an empathy standpoint, whats in it for her?  Oh nothing?  But there is a huge potential downside?

However, if you&#x27;ve spent any time in a committed relationship, you&#x27;ll know that pretty much the only things that matter are how she feels about herself and how she feels about you (and the converses for you, which are heavily influenced by those).  All the stuff about hotness, income, intelligence, background, careers, etc. fades into the background, and you figure out how to make it work.<p>I suspect the reason that dating sucks in the Bay Area is because the Bay Area attracts guys (and women, but to a lesser extent) who are overly concerned with how they&#x27;re perceived by others.  After all, everybody is chasing the latest hot startup that will make them wealthy and famous.  That same insecurity - and the same insecurity that would make you bail on an area just because there are no girls - is massively unattractive to women.<p>I spent a year and a half dating around, including some very hot women.  After realizing that none of that mattered and the only thing important was how I felt when I was with her, it took me all of 3 weeks to find a partner.",1393973923

While it&#x27;s true that all software can have bugs, these are extraordinarily unsophisticated attacks that any non-hacker can exploit by, say, refreshing his browser in rapid succession.<p>That is, there is a sliding scale with regard to the level of competence imputed to, say, a certain <i>type</i> of bug. And, this wasn&#x27;t a simple coding error (which, can be more easily forgiven). This was a fundamental oversight in the overall approach to the software, with regard to a critical operation. And it involves such basic concepts as transactions and race conditions. While eliminating the latter can be difficult to get right, it appears that they didn&#x27;t even consider the fact that they could occur.<p>I am one of the guys in your group who thinks &quot;have I considered everything?&quot; In fact, I would be inclined to believe that I haven&#x27;t. Perhaps that&#x27;s pessimism or just realism, given what I&#x27;ve seen from determined hackers attacking my business over the years. So, I can certainly give a pass to oversights or errors.

I&#x27;ve always thought it was coincidence but I remain wary of the cost/benefit. Here&#x27;s an interesting article on experimentation with LSD by mathematicians, engineers, designers and artists.<p>&#x27;In mid-&#x27;60s LSD research study, dosed scientists achieved creative breakthroughs:<p>Over the course of the preceding year, IFAS researchers had dosed a total of 22 other men for the creativity study, including a theoretical mathematician, an electronics engineer, a furniture designer, and a commercial artist. By including only those whose jobs involved the hard sciences (the lack of a single female participant says much about mid-century career options for women), they sought to examine the effects of LSD on both visionary and analytical thinking. Such a group offered an additional bonus: Anything they produced during the study would be subsequently scrutinized by departmental chairs, zoning boards, review panels, corporate clients, and the like, thus providing a real-world, unbiased yardstick for their results.<p>In surveys administered shortly after their LSD-enhanced creativity sessions, the study volunteers, some of the best and brightest in their fields, sounded like tripped-out neopagans at a backwoods gathering. Their minds, they said, had blossomed and contracted with the universe. They’d beheld irregular but clean geometrical patterns glistening into infinity, felt a rightness before solutions manifested, and even shapeshifted into relevant formulas, concepts, and raw materials.<p>[The volunteers] remained firm: LSD absolutely had helped them solve their complex, seemingly intractable problems. But here’s the clincher. After their 5HT2A neural receptors simmered down, they remained firm: LSD absolutely had helped them solve their complex, seemingly intractable problems. And the establishment agreed. The 26 men unleashed a slew of widely embraced innovations shortly after their LSD experiences, including a mathematical theorem for NOR gate circuits, a conceptual model of a photon, a linear electron accelerator beam-steering device, a new design for the vibratory microtome, a technical improvement of the magnetic tape recorder, blueprints for a private residency and an arts-and-crafts shopping plaza, and a space probe experiment designed to measure solar properties.

7343781,comment,7335211,7342930,1,0,halostatue,,,"Your extraction attempt actually proves my point: your code is more complex, is less readable, is demonstrably wrong, and destroys performance in at least two ways (I’d benchmark my “ugly” code against yours every time and win).<p>More complex and less readable: you’ve taken the comparison out of context of the class which is being used for comparison and put it in a different class and file that has to be opened for understanding a priority comparison. Worse, that separate class and file <i>isn’t</i> going to be reusable for anything else, because it depends heavily on the (admittedly large, but justifiably so) public interface of MIME::Type. So, readability is made worse for the sake of a dubious improvement in testability and no value in reuse.<p>If your editor supports code folding (it should, and you should be using it), then you don’t even have to see the implementation of `priority_compare` if you don’t need it.<p>Demonstrably wrong: you’re calling `#simplified_value` twice. You could make that not as ugly by caching, but that’s already known to be a waste of time because your extraction…<p>Destroys performance: `priority_compare` is used for sorting (as the code comment states outright). Creating a new object for each and every comparison is going to send sort performance to hell in a handbasket with rockets on it. It’s the same problem that plagues people who use decoration heavily: performance sucks and memory use gets ugly quick. The calling of `#simplified_value` twice doesn’t help here, and caching the value only makes memory use worse.<p>The code comment on `priority_compare` is clear: it’s a specialized implementation of `<=>` used for sorting from MIME::Types#[]. That should <i>immediately</i> halt any consideration of extracting the code into an object that needs creation, and continuing on with that is a failure of good software development in favour of purity suggested by stupid rules. Even extracting it into a class method is of highly questionable value, because now you have to (as you do with your extraction) know the left and right comparison objects, rather than (safely) assuming that the undecorated version is the object itself. It’s rather the difference between operators overloading in C++ where you need to provide both left and right values vs only providing the right value because the left value is the object itself.<p>I considered separating the if/elsif conditions to separate methods, but you <i>still</i> need the if/elsif conditions, and all you’re doing is pushing code around in ways that, once again, will not be used <i>outside</i> of `priority_compare`.<p>I had considered implementing `priority_compare` at the call-site, but it’s used at two places in MIME::Types. So, the `priority_compare` is reused, but the component parts aren’t, really.<p>I will admit to laying a trap with `priority_compare`: I’ve worked on this code off and on for ten years. Code Climate, being a naïve program, cannot understand how the code is going to be <i>used</i>, but only understands how it’s defined and measures it against some fairly simplistic and stupid metrics. They can be interesting when you are first approaching a program to understand hotspots, but their value drops to zero <i>very</i> quickly compared to the understanding you have from working with the code regularly.<p>Where I think Code Climate (and similar tools; they just happen to be fairly high-profile in the Ruby community) goes wrong is that a lot of inexperienced and naïve developers tend to treat it as Truth that Must Be Followed. Many of these folks are also fans of so-called “Clean Code” techniques and otherwise lack the experience necessary to know <i>when</i> not to follow these sorts of rules and assume that Code Climate is good becaus it simplifies the score to a GPA/grade.",1393973247

Rewriting in a stricter language, maybe.  But Haskell has a big runtime and garbage collection and its own compiler and would be a big pain to integrate everywhere that uses C TLS libraries; smaller compile-to-C languages might be easier, but who wants to use an experimental language to develop crypto code?  ...And you&#x27;d still want to test it, because although functional programming style makes many bug classes less likely, it&#x27;s not a panacea.  You&#x27;re still basically hoping that the developer doesn&#x27;t make a single thinko.<p>Compared to that:<p>- Better unit testing is much easier to integrate into existing projects.  Yes, it can only prevent a bug if the developer generally thought of the class of error, but at least it sort of forces them to spend some time thinking about possible failure cases, and can detect cases where their mental model was wrong.  Also, it helps detect regressions: &quot;goto fail&quot; wasn&#x27;t a strange edge case the developer didn&#x27;t think of, it was a copy paste error which good unit tests could have caught.<p>- Functional testing can be independent of the implementation and written by someone unrelated.  They can only do so much in general, but they might have caught both of these bugs.<p>Yes, audits are another option, but I&#x27;d say they should complement tests, not replace them.<p>ed: oh, and if you want to be really intellectually rigorous, you could try to formally verify your C code; model could have bugs but could also be implementation independent.

7343568,comment,7336024,7342212,2,0,randomsearch,,,"ok, to clarify: I was talking about academia as a job, not as a PhD student. Also, I think your points were interesting and I didn&#x27;t disagree with a lot of them, but I&#x27;d like to add a little more, don&#x27;t know if this helps at all...<p>> I&#x27;ve found it to be quite stressful, unrewarding, and intellectually smothering. Reasons include overlong hours, jerks and bullies in positions of power, territorial battles, arrogance and shortsightedness.<p>I know plenty of PhD students who struggle to cope with the stress. Not so many academics, to be honest. The academics who complain about stress would also likely struggle in industry.<p>Also, I did say <i>less stressful</i> than industry. I can assure you my industrial job was a lot more stressful - if only because I had responsibility for major systems that affected 10000s of people directly. Basically, being terrified of messing things up or trying to fire fight when things went wrong. Overlong hours are rife in the tech industry, and you won&#x27;t find the other complaints to be any different, I&#x27;m afraid. So, it&#x27;s a relative decision. Most jobs carry some stress. But for me, the wins of academia far outweigh the downsides. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I felt it important to point out that the academia-backlash we&#x27;re seeing at the moment is not necessarily an objective viewpoint.<p>> Others are also really smart, but don&#x27;t care (deeply about what they do).<p>That is far more common in industry, because people turn up for the pay cheque more than anything else. I know few academics with this attitude.<p>> Most are pretty smart, but not very interested in anything outside of an extremely narrow focus. Since most people have no interest in or knowledge of what others do, or desire to learn, I find it decidedly un-stimulating.<p>I guess this depends on the institution you&#x27;re at. The two I&#x27;ve worked in within the UK are quite highly regarded. Colleagues tend to love learning.<p>> As a young and enthusiastic student bringing new ideas to the table, I&#x27;m on the other end of this. Ideas are met with resistance, mockery, endless rounds of meetings and debates, and intellectual laziness (i.e. &quot;I could spend some time thinking about this idea and give meaningful feedback, but instead I&#x27;ll just axe it&quot;). It&#x27;s incredibly demotivating.<p>This just sounds like bad supervision. A lot of PhD students complaining on the web seem to have had poor supervision. It&#x27;s not uncommon either, and something I think academia really needs to work on. FWIW, the people I work closely with dedicate a huge amount of time to their PhD students and the feedback we get from them is overwhelmingly positive. It does take a lot of time though, and we do go above-and-beyond somewhat.<p>> However, I haven&#x27;t really gotten much benefit from being \t\n\tphysically near to experts. Perhaps that&#x27;s my fault.<p>Could it be the stage in your career? Have you never walked into a seminar on something completely different? Or sat down with a colleague over coffee and had them explain (say) the current state of cancer research, amidst their cutting-edge discoveries? Those opportunities are priceless.<p>> This has not been true in my experience. We&#x27;re forced to focus on what is publishable (often, in the short term).<p>This is true, to some extent. But you <i>can</i> spend significant time looking further ahead, that&#x27;s the difference. And what may be regarded as &quot;short-term publishable&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be something you can deploy in a product. It could be something insightful and far-reaching, but ready for publication. Or just a great idea. Or something that inspires people. Most companies are not going to say &quot;that&#x27;s a great idea that will never make us money, do some more of that!&quot;<p>> Also, negative results (i.e. disproving a hypothesis, or showing that there&#x27;s no link between two variables) -- which can be significant, applicable data -- aren&#x27;t publishable.<p>They&#x27;re actually <i>less publishable</i>, rather than unpublishable, and there&#x27;s plenty of research on the relative publishability (to coin an unwanted phrase). See &quot;Bad Science&quot; for a summary.<p>> We&#x27;re also forced to focus on what is likely to bring in grant money.<p>This is true to some extent. But really, you have to find a balance. The greatest, supersmart researchers I&#x27;ve met have to follow the money too -- to an extent. But they get a balance, do their bit, contribute some money that often supports PhD students through their study (as someone once pointed out to me when I made the same complaint as a PhD student!), and then get back to working on their research.<p>> Wouldn&#x27;t know. My work has been crap-covered crap, with a side-helping of crap. I feel that the current trend to focus only on extraordinarily meaningful results has actually made it tougher for people to make real contributions -- because if you don&#x27;t sell it (in the sense of over-hyping it), even if it&#x27;s going to make a real difference, it&#x27;ll be tough to publish in a decent journal, or to get grant money.<p>Selling is indeed part of the job -- it also has been. Communication is really important in academia. Collaboration and dissemination are key.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t feel that your work has been great :-/. Sometimes this can be a problem of judging your own position; it&#x27;s really hard to see the big picture wrt your work. You may be your own worst critic. I don&#x27;t know your situation, but I&#x27;ve seen others students feel the same and it wasn&#x27;t true in those cases...<p>> I don&#x27;t want to be part of a machine that has generated enormous progress, if 1) it&#x27;s not currently generating enormous progress, or 2) I&#x27;m not helping it to generate enormous progress.<p>ok, (1) is clearly false, if you&#x27;re objective.<p>(2) is more difficult. I don&#x27;t think you can expect to see how your contribution fits in without looking back over a long period. And much of research is about 10 people trying something and one person&#x27;s idea comes off - the kind of reason why industry doesn&#x27;t do the work we do. I still think the other 9 people made a worthwhile contribution. Also, you don&#x27;t have to change the world to help. If you&#x27;re involved in teaching; if you&#x27;re part of the wider academic environment; if you contribute a tool that helps others; there are many ways to contribute to the overall, phenomenal, progress that academia has provided. And it takes time to learn how to do important work. It&#x27;s not as straightforward as it sounds!<p>One problem PhD students often have is that they don&#x27;t realise that the purpose of their PhD is research training. Most of the real research contributions come from postdocs, at least in the UK. Lecturers and Professors are busy and mostly act as supervisors/managers. PhD students are very much learning their craft, and as my assessor said to me &quot;you can forget about your PhD work now -- the best things you do will be in another 10 years and you&#x27;ll have forgotten what your thesis was about by then&quot; ;-). She was being facetious, but there&#x27;s a grain of truth there.<p>> Agreed. Conferences are awesome.<p>:-) I would add perhaps that &quot;some conferences are awesome&quot;! btw, I find conferences to be a larger and more specialised example of the environment of academic life in general -- so maybe you have been a bit unlucky with your environment, if you haven&#x27;t found the same experience at your uni.<p>> How, where, with whom -- I have little control over these.<p>If you&#x27;re a student, I could imagine this may be the case.<p>> This has been somewhat true for me. However, doesn&#x27;t really matter how flexible the hours are, if they&#x27;re way too much (and they are).<p>Again, compare to working for Google and the like...<p>> I expect that it would be extremely tough to afford a family.<p>The average household income in the UK is £40k, where two people work. A senior lecturer or a professor is going to be earning more than that on their own, and it is not uncommon for professors in particular to earn much, much more than that. I don&#x27;t think academic wages reflect the sacrifices we make, particularly the time and money sacrificed during a PhD; however, I love what I do and I feel I&#x27;m contributing to society in a way that my previous work in industry didn&#x27;t allow.",1393971049

I might be wrong again here.",1393970611

It assumes that members of Group X are the best (or even good) advocates for the welfare of Group X. But if Group X is underrepresented in the halls of power, it <i>does not follow</i> that Group X would be better off if they had more influence. This is easy to see by setting <i>Group X</i> to <i>minor children</i>, whose representation in powerful positions is negligible, and indeed whose members are ineligible even to vote. But extending the franchise to five-year-olds isn&#x27;t (to my knowledge) a top political priority, and rightly so. &quot;Children&#x27;s suffrage&quot; would generally make children worse off, not better.<p>Rather than a dog-eat-dog free-for-all that pits Group X against Group Y and Group Y against Group Z, a sounder principle is this: <i>for responsible government, the responsible must rule.</i> Responsible rulers can balance the inevitably competing interests of different groups, using the time-honored but curiously unfashionable virtue of <i>human wisdom</i>. And while it is certainly the case that there are many wise and responsible women—and, indeed, not a few wise and responsible children—the assumption that all human subgroups are on average equally wise and responsible is <i>completely unjustified</i>. The trickery implicit in the phrase &quot;excluded from a source of power&quot; is thus revealed: just because a group is underrepresented in the halls of power, it <i>does not follow</i> that they are being &quot;excluded&quot; by anything.<p>How then to ensure that the responsible will rule? We arrive now at the key question. It is as yet unanswered. But it seems like a question worth working on...",1393970509

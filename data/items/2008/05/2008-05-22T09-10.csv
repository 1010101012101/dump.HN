197013,comment,196729,196965,0,0,rms,,,"On the term sheet, a valuation that gives the VCs 5-6% of the company and no company board. It's a reasonable valuation for an idea-stage startup when the investor is not YC. Most investors I know of at this stage offer better valuations than YC. A couple VC firms even give out free money. Of course none of the other firms are Y Combinator, where like Sequoia it would be a good deal to just give them equity for free. None of the other investors at this stage have been proven to provide a compelling value to their startups, but it seems obvious that a competent incubator that invests without asserting control is much better off for a startup than no incubator.<p>I think I would refuse to do the deal if they refuse to negotiate, though giving them 10% would be acceptable if they were reasonable about the process. Though it's really a bad sign that they proposed such a manipulative deal. I wouldn't want any of these guys on the board or to have a right to invest, because it torpedoes future deals if they don't do a follow-on investment. Lightspeed Summer Grants offers 500k investments to some startups coming through their program, but it's an offer, not an obligation.<p>But, if the idea was mediocre, no other investor would talk to me, I didn't have a job, I had no marketable skills, I had no place to live, and someone was offering me $25k dollars in check form, I'd probably just start the company and do whatever the VCs said. It's certainly possible that they will run the company well.<p>If the idea was the next facebook, or already was, I'd make a new post sharing the idea here as a document hosted on my site. At least one person has successfully raised funding by posting their executive summary here (slide deck or YC application would also be fine), I believe they offered to sell 5% for $25,000.<p>There are more investors out there, some even answer cold emails. Try asking for intros here, there are a lot of powerful lurkers. Or, make something great and wait until the next round of incubators.<p>--<p>These guys have usernames here and talked to me: <a href=""http://www.tandementrepreneurs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandementrepreneurs.com/</a><p><a href=""http://crv.com/quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crv.com/quickstart</a> also responded to me.",1211448334

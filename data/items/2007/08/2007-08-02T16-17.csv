38761,comment,38590,38700,0,0,diabloernest,,,"Nice thoughts! We share a common goal! :)<p>I am trying to solve  the problem of blog consumption. Blog consumption, by nature is personalized. You have your own set of feeds that you read daily. I have a different set. Which means that whatever feed/post appeals you, might not suit my taste, and vice versa. Thus, community rating like digg etc, is not the right way to treat your blog posts, or in other words, you should not draw your recommendations ""completely"" from such a system. That's why i intend to build a personalized system, (may be plugged in your favourite reader) for this!.

38760,comment,38699,38699,0,0,zach,,,"So I once watched this nutty 70's film series on time management - 43 Folders retro.  It was actually pretty good if you could get past the awful fashion.  The host, a professor in horn-rimmed glasses and a bowtie, had a piece of advice I found surprising at first.  It puts a different spin on doing hard things and I've found it very useful.<p>He said if something is truly hard to do, put it off as long as possible.  But if something is merely distasteful, do it as soon as possible.<p>The rationale is that if something is truly hard to do, you can spend time thinking about it, researching it, gathering resources and asking others about it while doing other necessary things.  Oftentimes, there will be a way to make the hard thing easier or even unnecessary.<p>But if something is more distasteful than hard-to-do, you need to do it right away.  It's worse to put off distasteful things than just get them over with.<p>Anyway, that bit of wisdom has worked for me.  In programming specifically, I also endorse David Heinemeier Hansson's advice: ""If something is too hard it means that you're not cheating enough.""",1186073213

38755,comment,38715,38747,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've got a couple coworkers trying to steer me towards business school (MBA, not undergrad), and they said that the real value is the network of classmates that you develop.  The courses basically consist of reading lots of case-studies - if you read a lot, you probably do that or the equivalent anyway.  But you can't fake the experience of getting a lot of smart, successful people together.<p>I found that that was also the primary benefit of going to a top private college.  My courses at Amherst weren't all that much better than those at a good state school - yeah, they were challenging, and the professors were good, but if you look hard you can get that at many other universities.  But almost every single one of my classmates is doing something interesting, whether it be physics grad school or traveling abroad or running a hedge fund or eliminating child soldiers in Africa or writing Broadway musicals or starting a company with me.",1186072834

38753,comment,38485,38713,0,0,edw519,,,"I don't want to debate fine points of ethics (I know, too late), but I thought I'd share a little more background, and then shut up.  OK?<p>Believe me, I'm not holier than thou - you should hear me in traffic.  But I really think that this is a black and white issue.  I don't see any difference between illegal downloading and walking out of Walgreen's with a CD in your pocket.  Or putting that extra chicken leg from the buffet into your purse.  ""They'd just have to throw it away, anyway.""  I don't care.  Right is right and wrong is wrong.<p>I don't ever want anyone to get the impression I'd employ situational ethics in business (or anywhere else, either).  And I do not want to knowingly conduct business with anyone that does.  It's simply not worth it, period.<p>I once had a partner that drew the ethical line where it was most convenient for him.  First, he copied software from one account to another.  Then, he went through a client's employee's drawers looking for something to ""save us a lot of time"".  Before I realized it, he was making back door deals with clients and vendors because he ""didn't think I'd mind; it was money I'd wouldn't have ever seen anyway.""<p>I'm certainly not suggesting that everyone progresses down that path, or that reusing tidbits of code is the same as murder.  It's just that when it's time to draw an ethical line in the sand, my position is clear and firm.<p>Just a few antecdotes to give you an idea of how strongly some business people feel about this issue:<p>- An acquintance of mine was earning $150 per hour advising a Fortune 1000 company which multi-million dollar enterprise package to buy.  As an aside, he brought in a buddy to sell printers to his client and split the profit.  He was immediately fired and black-balled.  The CEO's reasoning was, ""I would have never known if we made the right decision.""<p>- A vendor was presenting their software package to my client.  They said, ""We already know your industry.  In fact, we sold a system to XYZ Company.""  My client immediately dismissed the vendor.  He later said, ""That's all I need.  For one of his programmers to accidently say what I'm doing to an XYZ employee over coffee.""<p>- My client went bankrupt.  Their assets (including all IP) were acquired by a third party in the settlement.  Imagine their surprise when they had to compete with my client's ex-employee who set himself up in a software maintenance business at 1/2 industry rates.  How did he know who to call on and what software they had?  The case is still in litigation, but that guy's name will forever be dirt in this town.<p>- A contractor at one of my clients accidently left a thumb drive on a desk he was using.  It had 70,000 social security numbers on it.  What were they to think?<p>I could go on and on.  They are some real slime balls out there.  There are also plenty of good people who make stupid decisions to save a little time because ""it doesn't make much difference anyway"".  How are people supposed to know the difference?<p>And when it comes to technology, many business people are doubly in the dark.  Sometimes, TRUST is all they've got.  It's so ridiculously easy for many of us to earn a nice living (try digging ditches instead), why would you ever jeapordize that over something so trivial?

38752,comment,38715,38715,0,0,jraines,,,"This article says absolutely nothing about the value of a formal business education.<p>It says something vaguely negative about the value of business <i>textbooks</i>, the crapiness of which is pretty well established and acknowledged by professors and students alike.  See here for a classic example:  <a href=""http://www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textbookleague.org/103feyn.htm</a>  This refers to highschool textbooks but applies equally well, if not more so, to college business texts.<p>It's all about the professors.  Business is one of those academic fields, like Paul Graham notes, where the best practitioners are not the educators.  While this is very true as a generalization, there are exceptions -- mainly:  non-practicing educators who happen to be excellent at imparting practical knowledge, and ex-practioners who were once tops in their field.  You will find these professors concentrated in top schools, and you will not find them teaching from these textbooks.  So there is actually quite a lot of value in a business education <i>from a top school</i>.  The well-worn cliche about the value of networking at these institutions applies as well -- and it's not just networking in the abstract, it's learning how to network with people who can get things done, and getting things done for people who expect big things out of you.  Just like I'm sure it is in computer science, the value of the education is what you extract from it.

Simple and Robust is good.  I would be surprised if there was more than a couple of hours in it if you know what you're doing but it's beer money for a poor student ;-)
if you're interested, email me and i'll give you some more details (current website location for the 'before' shot and a copy of what i've got to hand and a brief spec) and then if you could estimate the time/cost (maybe an example of something you've done in the wild) I'll get some budget authorised and we can take it from there. if it is as easy as i think, should be done in a week or so.  Prefer UK based but not a deal breaker, just easier to move the payment.

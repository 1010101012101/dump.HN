That&#x27;s about what they&#x27;d need to make up the revenue from the current Sunday Ticket package, if DirectTV&#x27;s pricing (around $300/season) is any guide.<p>Maybe more consumers would buy access to games if they could buy them individually, so you&#x27;d end up with 4x the number of current Sunday Ticket subscribers buying at least 5 games a year. But that seems like a lot. Eventually you run out of sufficiently motivated out-of-market fans. Remember that the teams with big out-of-market fan bases are just the teams that get picked routinely for national coverage.

6755639,comment,6750898,6753566,1,0,gtaylor,,,"> Yes, every situation is different, but replacing capacity that you use at peak on AWS will cost you much less to buy, rack, and power yourself considering hardware and hosting costs.<p>The important thing to keep in mind with a DIY situation is that there are additional costs besides hardware/rack/space, and a lot of things that you may have a hard time putting a dollar value on (flexibility). It&#x27;s not accurate to just throw out the cost for a Sandy Bridge Xeon + rack space without factoring in the other stuff (upgrades, maintenance, if you need to add an employee, the lessened mobility, the increased responsibility, etc).<p>At our current scale, if we went the DIY route, we&#x27;d need to hire someone else to take over more of the Ops situation for us. An additional employee would cost a lot more than paying AWS a bit more (salary, management overhead, good benefits, communication). We&#x27;d also have more &quot;stuff&quot; to worry about, whereas right now our small team spends 98% of our time working on our product, marketing, and sales. This is entirely anecdotal and specific to our situation, but I mention it as an example.<p>> All the hype of &quot;cloud&quot; makes people think that it&#x27;s the only and/or best way to do it - certainly not the case for every sort of business.<p>I personally can&#x27;t stand the &quot;cloud&quot; buzz word, because it doesn&#x27;t adequately describe anything. I am no &quot;cloud&quot; zealot, but on the same token I think some bare-metal-always-wins advocates don&#x27;t really &quot;get&quot; what AWS is doing or when it&#x27;s appropriate to use them (even if they appear more expensive at face value). As a developer, I&#x27;ve seen the kind of crazy neat things we can do with the flexibility and the shifting of responsibilities to AWS. For us, AWS is a no-brainer, though we do wish we had a more affordable route to going hybrid than DirectConnect or their dedicated machine offerings. But like I said, I wouldn&#x27;t dare make a generalized assertion of AWS&#x27; value to others based on our situation. Every company/staff/application is different.",1384796907

6755621,comment,6754924,6754924,29,0,annon,,,"This article does a good job of covering the basics of bidding, but most of these things should be obvious. In performance marketing, the goal is to know how much money you are going to make for a given visitor before that visitor enters your site. Then, you can use any number of bidding models to reach maximum profit.<p>What is really lacking here, is that Adwords is not just a basic auction system. If I have a Max CPC of $1.00, and you have a Max CPC of $0.85, it is not certain that I am going to be at a higher ad space than you.<p>There are a number of variables that Google takes in to account to determine the order of placements in an auction, and it obfuscates all these variables in to something called a &#x27;Quality Score&#x27;, which publicly operates on a integer scale of 1-10. Google uses the quality score to manipulate auctions to perform better for google, not the advertiser. Here&#x27;s some of the most important factors:<p>CTR: If you&#x27;re holding down position one, but nobody is clicking your ad, google is not making money. Just like you as a performance marketer, Google is not trying to get the maximum profit per individual click. They are trying to get the maximum volume of profitable clicks. One key here is to not just dip your toe in to a keyword. If you overbid (usually to a loss) out of the gate, you will get substantial volume faster, thus giving you a better CTR and a higher quality score. Once you have solidified your position in the auction, you can then ratchet down your bid to a profitable level.<p>Page Relevancy: It is important that your landing page is relevant to both the keyword you are bidding on, as well as your ad copy that you displayed. Google AdsBot will index your landing page using algorithms similar to it&#x27;s organic bot. Page load time is a major factor here as well. This is google playing the long tail. They want to make sure that whoever clicked on the ad is happy with the experience they get on the landing page, so that they will in the future click on more ads. If a user keeps ending up on junk pages, they are less likely to click on ads or use google in the future.<p>Account History: This is in my opinion, one of the most frustrating parts of adwords, and it&#x27;s impact seems to vary wildly from vertical to vertical. The age of your account and ads can play a major role in how much you are paying. How much of an impact? I&#x27;ve seen ads that are 3-4 years old cost $1-2/click, and an entirely new account at a new company cost upwards of $10-15/click on the same keyword. The more volatile the space, the bigger the disparity is. There is very little information out there about how/why this is, but here is my theory: The majority of people using adwords at scale are using it entirely for performance marketing. As such, if you get knocked out of a top position on a high volume keyword, it can have a significant effect to your bottom line. If a company has consistently been on a keyword spending money every day for 2-3 years, you would assume that they are going to stay there if they keep their position. If you allow a newcomer to come in and spend to a loss for a while, disrupting the positions of established players, there is not a guarantee that the established player will ever recover on that keyword. And since this new player has been spending so much, they can&#x27;t afford to keep operating and have closed up shop. The net effect is less money for google. Again, this comes more in to play in volatile markets, but is straight up market manipulation.<p>----<p>As far as questions regarding technology to optimize SEM is concerned, Google has mostly prevented this from happening by having one of the worst API&#x27;s I have ever worked with. They will make marginal changes and sunset the old version after only a couple months. Many of their practices seem somewhat openly hostile to developers working with their API. While being good performance marketers, data is our friend. We want as much of it as we can get. Google, however, wants us to only have just enough information to keep spending money. It is not their goal for you to have a 100% optimized campaign. They know there are junk queries that are worth less, and want you to keep blending those in with those that are performing, so that they can make more money.<p>Anybody that&#x27;s curious about their tech should take a look in to what it takes to build something that uses the Adwords API. The fact that they can have such an awful API and tools for something that makes 70%+ of their revenue is amazing.",1384796679

Terrorism is but a small piece of it, though it&#x27;s the one easiest to sell to the public. But even serious terrorism doesn&#x27;t accomplish much without state support (you might consider the Taliban a &quot;state&quot; for this purpose) and it&#x27;s well within the purview of intelligence to spy on other states.<p>But ultimately, the real reason of intelligence? Look at it this way: the US is sitting at a poker table with Britain, Germany, Russia, China, Japan, and so on. Some of the other players might be our friends--Britain and the US have a deal that we&#x27;ll share each other&#x27;s winnings and cover each other&#x27;s losses. But nonetheless, everyone at the table is playing to win. And everyone at the table is trying to sneak a peek at everyone else&#x27;s cards. This is why the distinction between spying on Americans and spying on foreigners is such a big deal--if you spy on a Japanese industrialist, you get to see some of Japan&#x27;s cards, and that helps in the game.

One comment below suggested that you read the literature (I presume that means the literature about suicide prevention) and I would second that advice. To expand that advice a bit, I&#x27;ll note that Martin E. P. Seligman and some other psychologists who have studied depression and suicide think that the &quot;self esteem&quot; movement that took over United States schools after I graduated from high school may have actually INCREASED risk of suicide in the United States--certainly the rates of both attempted and completed suicide, and the rate of diagnosed youth depression, went up over the years when those school programs were put in place. In other words, don&#x27;t just rely on intuition about what would be helpful, but look into actual research. Seligman&#x27;s books <i>Learned Optimism</i>[1] and <i>The Optimistic Child</i>[2] are both helpful, although there should be some even newer research out by now. Reading those books may help you deal with the challenges of working on this interesting project while keeping up with your school work.

6755464,comment,6754849,6754849,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"(trigger warning, obvs)<p>....And actual discussions about rape and rape culture become even more diminished as the law <i>completely overlooks</i> the wide-ranging aspects of rape. It&#x27;s often very difficult to identify if what you are seeing is consensual or not, so now the law&#x27;s basically going to redefine rape as... What? Some stereotype of a guy in a mask with a knife to a defenseless person&#x27;s neck?<p>From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, 
  abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable 
  of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, 
  incapacitated, or below the legal age of consent.
</code></pre>
How the fuck are they going to be able to tell if the person in the picture is of legal age of consent, or under the influence, or if they&#x27;ve been coerced? What if they&#x27;re just scared shitless and go along without consenting because of prior trauma? Does the law give any indication how to tell just from a picture or video what is rape and what isn&#x27;t? Does a blog post or support forum depicting one&#x27;s own rape count as &#x27;porn&#x27;?<p>There is no way to tell if something is or isn&#x27;t rape just from looking as an outsider. Rape varies in who is the victim, who is the abuser, and the circumstances of how the attack takes place - often it doesn&#x27;t even look like an attack. Often it&#x27;s a family member or relative. It very rarely gets reported and it&#x27;s almost never prosecuted successfully. All this law&#x27;s going to do is whitewash the reality of rape culture and prevent people from addressing real issues in an adult fashion.<p>The other way to look at this is: Was rape already illegal? Yes. And wouldn&#x27;t possession of proof of rape just be used against you in court? Yes. So what does this law actually accomplish? It attempts to sweep under the rug any thoughts or imagery of rape, as if to pretend it never existed.<p>Good job, Cameron.",1384795419

The Conservatives (David Cameron&#x27;s party) are in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. We can debate the merits of the coalition (many do), but the upside is that some of the more extreme policies many Tories wanted to put through have been blocked.<p>This creates a dilemma for David Cameron, not too dissimilar from that of the US Republicans right now: on the one hand, there&#x27;s an increasingly vocal wing of the party that favors extremely conservative policies (such as pulling out of the EU completely, replacing the EU Human Rights Act, small government, big cuts, etc). On the other, there&#x27;s the harsh reality that these policies have no chance of getting through a parliament where they don&#x27;t have an absolute majority.<p>So we are left in this situation where David Cameron announces, on a fairly regular basis, policies that are intended to appease his vocal right wing members (a &quot;British Bill of Rights&quot;, a referendum to exit the EU, outlawing violent pornography, etc) that realistically have no chance of becoming legislation. In the unlikely event these policies actually <i>do</i> become legislation (such as forcing unemployed people claiming benefits to work for free) they normally end up being struck down by the courts.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t disagree with your assessment that the UK is rather more puritan than many of its continental Europe peers - but these policies aren&#x27;t coming out of that. They&#x27;re coming out of the fact an election is not all that far away, and the Tories desperately don&#x27;t want to end up in another coalition government.",1384794383

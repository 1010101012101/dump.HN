Its defintely an exciting idea, but I just can't see anybody become truly taken with their thermostat.Perhaps its a jaded world view, but I feel that there is great demand for games and distractions, and not necessarily quality products or innovation. I can't help but consider that RIM is struggling for market share, and its largely been attributed to a lack of innovative games/apps.<p>I do agree that this product presents a greater benefit to the earth and humanity as a whole, but my concern is that the populous may not notice.

I was up to speed and productive in it within a couple of days. (This was in the days of Perl 4 -- the OO stuff in Perl 5 came years later.) At that level, Perl was basically every UNIX text-handling tool rolled into one handy bundle oriented around script execution rather than interactive shell work, with a bunch of POSIX extras and things like the socket() API thrown in to take it beyond the toy language level.<p>The point is, Perl isn't a beginner's language. Rather, it's an elaboration of a pre-existing toolset that assumes you're already familiar with the UNIX way before you get started. Pitching it against a teaching language isn't even an apples/oranges comparison: it's like comparing a circus merry-go-round to a helicopter (they're simply not intended for the same purpose or the same user demographic).",1319535246

The difference is that the vehicles are fresh (new from old stock/conservation) and they &quot;come with all the accessories, if you know what I mean&quot; (wink-wink, nudge-nudge, say no more).<p>Maybe the guys from the South-East really did buy their stuff at the surplus store, like Putin said.<p>According to the same source, a tank (with all accessories included?) would cost ~$200,000.",1411102766

8339048,comment,8334442,8334442,1,0,brantcooper,,,"Regardless of how you define brand, most of us appear to agree that the world has changed and so branding itself needs re-branding. I think all the responses here address that with viable viewpoints. The mistake would be -- just as with implementing lean startup on the product side -- is to believe that there&#x27;s a silver bullet or &quot;one right way.&quot;<p>The key is to digest the principles and eventually &#x27;make them your own&#x27;, so that you develop products, services and yes, brand, that are true to your values and authentic.<p>There are a lot of variables at play here, not the least of which is, how &quot;disruptive&quot; is your startup endeavor? If you are truly disrupting a market or turning an existing market on its head, your methods around brand development differ versus re-segmenting [Steve Blank] an existing market, or merely re-branding an existing market, or creating new markets within the innovation efforts of existing large enterprises.<p>IMO, to think that a brand definition is owned by the consumer is as foolhardy as to think it&#x27;s owned by the business. This is why it&#x27;s a relationship: it&#x27;s two sided; it encompasses both the promise of the product plus the emotional impact the customer hopes to achieve with her relationship to the organization.<p>This is pretty straightforward, actually. And, by the way, measurable. Customers don&#x27;t share, endorse, show-off, or refer products they are satisfied with. And yet, products themselves most often can&#x27;t achieve an emotional impact beyond &#x27;satisfaction.&#x27; So what&#x27;s the difference between brands that satisfy and those that generate passion?<p>This is what The Lean Brand tackles. How do you <i>discover</i> and create a lean value stream that purposefully creates &quot;satisfaction&quot; from the product utility and &quot;passion&quot; from the emotional impact the entire organization delivers.",1411102412

8339036,comment,8338241,8338923,3,0,robert_tweed,,,"They appear to be using the term &quot;slow reading&quot; to distinguish it from online reading:<p>&quot;One 2006 study of the eye movements of 232 people looking at Web pages found they read in an &quot;F&quot; pattern... None of this is good for our ability to comprehend deeply, scientists say.&quot;<p>I personally have 3 styles of reading:<p>- Fiction, I read incredibly slowly, and always have done.<p>- Technical books, I absorb very quickly, often scanning through parts covering topics I already know well, and spending longer on anything that is new. In any case, there is no &quot;narrative&quot; to follow, but the structure still tends to be linear (one topic builds on the last).<p>- Online, I read in a &quot;spiral&quot; pattern, skipping between headlines, then reading the first and last parts to narrow in on what I think is most relevant.<p>Reading every word from start to finish is an inefficient way to extract information online. If I am interested in a particular topic, I don&#x27;t have to read just one article on that subject. 90% of online content is badly written or factually incorrect in some way, so over-committing to one source typically results in a lot of wasted effort. The better strategy is to speed read 5 or 6 different sources and then return to whichever one gets its point across concisely. This also tends to reinforce a bias towards content that is presented in small chunks with diagrams.<p>Over the last 18 months I&#x27;ve been spending a lot more time than usual reading technical books and I have noticed that the amount of time I spend reading online has affected my ability to speed read technical books the way I normally do. I have to concentrate harder to avoid scanning in an F or spiral shaped pattern.<p>That strategy works online because the aim is to discard bad content as quickly as possible. It does not work when your aim is to follow the narrative of a book that is almost always linear and is often more information-dense than online content.<p>This linearity is amplified further in fiction because it is an intrinsic property of the narrative structure (except perhaps, in &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; books).<p>It therefore makes sense that reading fiction helps people avoid the habit of scanning content, skipping over the middle parts. Online, the middle parts often don&#x27;t matter because the signal to noise ratio is low. In other formats, that is often not the case.",1411102195

There are things that are easier to learn in an academic setting than in any other setting.<p>So, the short answer is I would highlight your professional experience, but would not hide your lack of education.<p>The longer answer is, if you are getting into a resume/web form search cycle you are probably doing it wrong.  Your best bet is for personal recommendations.  If after 5 years in the industry you do not have colleagues that can sherpa you into a job that you are interested in, education is not your problem.

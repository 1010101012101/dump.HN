6589345,comment,6588802,6589260,2,0,Groxx,,,"If you have any ideas (I have little experience in building libs like this, but will definitely learn): currently I need a streaming JSON decoder (which handles base64-encoded blobs as some values, so values need to be stream-decoded too, possibly with another custom step).  So far this lib (and nearly every other) seems to assume a pre-defined set of classes, and/or that you want the full response before acting on it (no streaming access).<p>Before you ask, I don&#x27;t control the response, so I can&#x27;t do something more sane :)  And it&#x27;s on Android, so memory can be quite restrictive, and GC hurts a <i>lot</i> with so much allocation.<p>I don&#x27;t see an easy way to plug those requirements into this library.  Superficially it seems I can modify/add something inherited from BaseRequest and add my own HttpClientHelper.requestAsync-style method to do this, but it&#x27;s yet another library that doesn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> allow this kind of thing natively.<p>But by the time I&#x27;ve understood and made those changes, I might as well just do it all by hand in that particular request.  This is especially true since my code has to be read and understood by others I work with, and it makes updating the Unirest library a much more error-prone event that might leave people in the lurch since they didn&#x27;t write the extension.  There&#x27;s no real happy solution.<p>--<p>Not that I really think it <i>should</i> easily handle my case - it looks really nice to use, and it&#x27;s probably not worth it to you / most people, and my case is weird and might ruin everything to properly support.  But it&#x27;s a minor thing that annoys me a bit and makes me want to make my own (minor annoyances are a major motivator for my personal projects).  Before I can make anything decent though I need to see a few more ways to do things, try a few crazy architectures, etc.  This has helped remind me what it can <i>look</i> like at least, and the code looks surprisingly clean underneath.  Definitely a worthwhile read :)",1382406711

I should note that Asia overall (not just Japan) does not have a track record of developing globally popular consumer-facing software aside from game software.

The data structure could be saved to json, and them reloaded back into javascript.  The cool thing is that changing a value (a2 = 3) automatically updates dependent values in the rest of the data structure.  The data structure can be referenced much like the spreadsheet - it is a tree with branches for pages, rows, columns.  There is a simple faster csv like API that makes it easy to go page by page, row by row.  Also, cells can be looked up explicitly.<p>The code is proprietary, which is a shame.

That said, VMs and containers have been around for decades.<p>Lots of the recent activity is more about packaging and usability improvements, rather than theoretical improvements.<p>A quick overview:
CoreOS is a super-minimal Linux distribution designed to be used as a base for applications. It&#x27;s essentially equivalent to the JEOS buzzword from five years ago. It would run inside of Xen or KVM or VMWare.<p>Xen, KVM, VMWare, Virtualbox, you probably already know about- they provide a virtual machine, the operating system running inside of it (theoretically) can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not on its own hardware. Xen uses a &#x27;hypervisor&#x27;, which is essentially a very tiny, custom kernel. KVM uses the Linux kernel as the hypervisor, which makes a lot of sense- you don&#x27;t have to reimplement all the years of hardware support and scheduling work they&#x27;ve done. VMWare and Virtualbox run as applications on whatever OS you provide. You lose out on some opportunities for clever performance hacks this way, but there are other advantages. VMWare ESX[i] is more like Xen & KVM, but I don&#x27;t really know that much about it.<p>Containers (BSD jails, Solaris zones, LXC, and of course, HN&#x27;s lovechild Docker) let you provide VM-like isolation and resource management between processes or groups of processes, but you only run one kernel. This means much less duplicated effort and memory, and Docker&#x27;s AUFS lets you deduplicate your storage too. There are slightly more security concerns about this approach than full VMs, the Linux kernel (and others, but let&#x27;s be honest about the target audience) has a long and ugly history of local privilege escalations.<p>ZeroVM is based on Google Chrome&#x27;s NaCL, and that&#x27;s about all I know about it. I would expect VM-like security (it validates machine code), and an environment that requires serious porting from POSIX. That said, if you use Python, Ruby, Mono-compatible .NET, or Go, the heavy lifting has already been done for you.",1382404812

Quite why it has so much to spend is the other question, especially in Quebec where there are other rather pressing needs.<p>I don&#x27;t think many Canadians realise just how many non-Canadian workers they are subsidising as a result of all of this. There is the official logic of training locals in skills that get imported alongside government incentives, however, what seems to happen is you get a mobile group of people that just follow the incentives around from province to province.<p>One thing Bombardier do have in their favour is they are a local entity and the taxes on any profits do return to the system, so I can&#x27;t fault them on that.",1382404406

Or shoot even look at Disney and its repurposing old tales.\nI think it is also true a lot of people create things BECAUSE there is a copyright and people can make money of it.\nThe question is, how long do we let them have a copyright? Where would music be today if we couldn&#x27;t build on Beethoven? So obviously infinity isn&#x27;t the answer.\nAnd while some people would create, just because, some people wouldn&#x27;t if the copyright term is too short.\nThe US Constitution says &quot;a limited time&quot; but what does that mean? I think that any term that is longer than the average lifetime, may as well be infinite.\nI can&#x27;t find the article now but there was some research shown that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have many books over 25 years old that are still in copyright.

Hopefully yes; hopefully the story makes sense without this extra chapter.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to watch a film with extra fluff that added nothing to the story, just for a cash-grab by the maker of the film.<p>Extra add-on features are always pointless: look at the Dreamcast and the add-on packs you could put into the controller.

They cleared out <i>tons</i> of misconceptions people have about space, while introducing very little of their own (Gravity being the biggest offender) - and they did it in a way that captured the interest of general population. I like the trend of making realistic science fiction, and I hope it continues.<p>> <i>Maybe all scientists and researchers should take classes in creative writing, fiction, and speech.</i><p>There&#x27;s a risk with going too far with that though. A scientist who makes their writing <i>too</i> creative can do more harm than good to the domain, and to public perception of science. The risk increases exponentially if the work is being managed by a creative director - they&#x27;ll likely take liberties with accuracy in order to make the work more general-population-friendly. Science is a hard thing to explain right. Yes, quite a lot of even the most advanced concepts <i>can</i> be presented simply, but it&#x27;s a very delicate and precise work, if you want the simplification to be right, and not misleading.<p>--<p>As for space education, Kerbal Space Program is absolutely the best thing ever.

You probably have thought about these yourself, but anyway:<p>- Have you ever thought about increasing the price? I find $5/month to be at the very low-end for something that a language learner may be using  regularly. If I find the product useful I&#x27;d be happy to pay $25/month or more for it. Increasing the price also has the side effect the you&#x27;ll get &quot;serious&quot; language learners to sign up, which is probably what you want.<p>- Have you thought about recommending appropriate texts your users based on their difficulty? I don&#x27;t know anything about Chrome plugins, but I assume that you can collect data about which pages and texts users are browsing, how often they&#x27;re clicking on stuff, and so on.

Won&#x27;t you need to state a concrete size there?<p>No, Idris doesn&#x27;t actually care what &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are (concretely)... it just knows that if you happen to have a (Vec n a) and (Vec m a) lying arond, then you&#x27;ll get a (Vec (n+m) a) out.<p>> For usual generic types, erasure and code generation are equivalent in what they can do, because at some point you will specialize to concrete types.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand what you mean, but I think this is slightly wrong... You can think of the fully erased (Vec n a) representation as (n, void-star) in C-style or Array<Object> in JVM style. Note that &quot;a&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually appear. So the type is actually never needed at runtime -- all functions which have (Vec n a) as a parameter will just assume that it has been (statically) proven[1] that the pointed-to-array has the correct size. Because of parametricity, functions will not be allowed to actually access any &#x27;a&#x27; values directly. So it all works out.<p>Here&#x27;s another comment of mine that goes a bit deeper into the interplay between static proof and runtime checks: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10302863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10302863</a><p>Key being: You either need to <i>prove statically</i> or you need to <i>prove statically that you&#x27;ve checked at runtime</i>.<p>HTH.<p>[1] This is valid because call sites <i>must</i> provide such a proof (statically).",1452159055

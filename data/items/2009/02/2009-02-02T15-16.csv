462411,comment,462244,462380,0,0,gcv,,,"Looks like the Esc-. trick works in zsh as well. I didn't know about it. Cool. Thank you.<p>With regard to pushd and popd: these tricks work in zsh also. In addition, (again, zsh-specific) you can set these options:<p><pre><code>  setopt auto_pushd         # automatic directory stack
  setopt pushd_minus        # swap +/- for pushd and popd
  setopt pushd_silent       # no output after pushd and popd
  setopt pushd_to_home      # pushd with no arguments goes to ~
  setopt pushd_ignore_dups  # no duplicates in directory stack
</code></pre>
With these options set, every time you change directories using cd, the directory goes into your directory stack, basically executing an implicit pushd. Then, move around the directory structure a little, and try typing 'cd -<Tab>' (meaning type 'cd -' and press Tab for autocompletion). It'll list entries in your directory stack by number (so -1 is your previous directory, -2 is the one before, and so on). It's a handy wrapper for bare pushd/popd functionality.<p>Bash might offer similar functionality, but I don't know much about bash.",1233589924

It's worth more if teachers can sell it -- if a student starts working, that stake represents a fraction of the next forty years worth of earnings, but the teacher might expect to spend it over the next ten (and since it is equity, rather than fixed income, it might not be an appropriate thing to own for retirement).

462381,comment,462350,462350,0,0,pj,,,"The two are not mutually exclusive.  You can do business while learning programming.  Programming /will/ help you in business because with programming you can find answers easier.<p>The first thing I would do if I were you and I know what I know now, I would investigate Platforms as a Service.  These services allow you to get up and running with a database driven application very quickly and they reduce the amount of ""stuff"" you have to learn to build systems.  Your goal as a business person is not to be the person everyone goes to to get code done, but they'll come to you for answers in the form of reports, charts, and analysis. Today, you can get very far in that direction without programming.  My opinion is that web based Platforms as a Service (PaaS) are the future of systems development. Many will disagree.<p>Lots of people will also disagree with me when I say this, but I would suggest if you <i>are</i> going to learn programming, start with SQL.  It's not /that/ difficult, but it is very very powerful.  What you want to do as a business person is get complex answers out of a database of numbers. If you sit at the top of a company, you want to be able to drill into any piece of data, any aggregate you want and get the answer you need. These are the kinds of answers you will find yourself relying on a computer guy to get for you.<p>Why do I say SQL?  Because nearly every system you will ever use will use SQL.  It'll use SQL to create, read, update, and delete data in those massive databases you use.  Even if the SQL isn't exposed, you can use SQL to mine your own datasets outside applications.  Export them, then import them into your personal database and go to town. You'll be amazed at the answers you can dig out with SQL that you can't get any other way.<p>The first thing you will have to do is install a database server, which you'll need for nearly any kind of business programming anyway.  Go with Microsoft SQL Server Express, or MySQL. It depends on your work environment and what most people around you know.  Use whatever most people around you use.  You can choose something else later.<p>Now, once you learn SQL, you will naturally want to display the results you find on a web page.  At that point, you'll learn JavaScript and HTML, plus a connector language like .NET, PHP, or Java (unless you go with a Platform as a Service).<p>If you want to skip SQL, I say learn JavaScript. It's very powerful and used in the browser, so nearly every website uses it.  There are tons of tutorials and examples on the web. You can use it on the Pre. It's nearly ubiquitous anymore and all you need to get started is a text editor and a web browser.  Most other languages require a lot of setup, installation, and configuration of development environments.<p>That's my $0.02.  Ask programmers you know in the real world.  They'll be invaluable when you run into problems installing the database, connecting it up and getting something working at all.  Once you have that, the sky is the limit.<p>P.S.

If you compile a binary with debugging symbols (-g in gcc), 'objdump -S binary' will intersperse the assembly with the original code, letting you see what each line compiled into.<p>I use 'pushd' and 'popd' bash builtins. It lets you remember current directories and have a stack of locations that you've been.

462377,comment,462118,462223,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I am a native speaker of English who learned Chinese as a second language, beginning at the beginning of my university studies. I was part of the norming administration for the (never officially launched) test of Chinese as a foreign language developed in the early 1980s by a consortium of United States universities, and set the bar for all other test-takers with my reading score, and did very well in my grammar score too. For most of the 1980s, I was a contract Chinese-English interpreter for the United States Information Agency.<p>On Professor Moser's points:<p>1) Agree. Professor William Boltz points out that China missed one chance, historically, to transition to a more user-friendly writing system along the lines of Japanese kana syllabaries more than 2,000 years ago.<p><a href=""https://www.eisenbrauns.com/ECOM/_2KO0LUDAZ.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eisenbrauns.com/ECOM/_2KO0LUDAZ.HTM</a><p>2) Actually, there has only been mass literacy in China since alphabetical writing (either National China's zhuyin fuhao [BO PO MO FO] system or the PRC's Hanyu pinyin system) has been used for primary reading instruction. But, yes, there has never been an extension of that use of alphabetical writing into a sufficiently large number of adult texts for the systems to become pervasive in Chinese-speaking countries.<p>3) Historical sound change has played havoc with the originally sound-indicating aspects of traditional Chinese writing, so, yes, one can't rely on pronunciation as a guide to what to write, nor can one reliably read aloud an unfamiliar written character in most cases.<p>4) The next objection only applies to native speakers of English (or another Indo-European language) learning a second Indo-European language. Or else it's a mere restatement of what is above. In fact, the many Chinese people who are not native speakers of Mandarin<p><a href=""http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200501/03/eng20050103_169500.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200501/03/eng20050103_1695...</a><p>(a number far larger than most Western observers guess) rely heavily on cognate features of their native Sinitic languages (Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hakka, etc.) to muddle through in speaking and even writing Mandarin.<p>5) Yes, dictionary look-up in Chinese is very messy. The best approach, and the approach taken by professional editors in Chinese-speaking countries, is to learn the alphabetic writing systems well enough for alphabetic look-up. (I have seen this done.) But one still has to be able to count strokes to look up an unfamiliar written character of unknown pronunciation.<p>6) A peculiarity of the modern Chinese written language is the preservation of many stock phrases and cliches from the ancient written language, which has quite different grammar and some significant semantic changes in the meaning of individual characters. A well-read reader of English can bluff through some French and some Latin, but a reader of Chinese has to deal with much more ancient language.<p>7) This is just a restatement of point 2 above. If there were just one or two regularly used alphabets (a situation comparable to Japanese), the official ones would be used for romanization. Hanyu pinyin is in fact very elegant, having been designed by a team of linguists from the Soviet Union and the Chinese communist movement, and I find it very easy to use.<p>8) Yes, that's very Anglo-centric. I know various speakers of various languages (Ibo is one example) who have thrived when learning Chinese because their native language has phonologically distinctive tones, so learning tones is no problem for them. I agree with most native speakers of English that learning Chinese tones is difficult, but I can manage to speak Chinese over the telephone. The late Y. R. Chao told a funny story of traveling to Sweden one time and failing to buy a train ticket to his destination because he pronounced Malmö with the wrong tone. (Swedish has tone, also.)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language#Sounds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language#Sounds</a><p>9) Big deal.

Goldstein ""I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind."" In a 1950 letter to M. Berkowitz, Einstein stated that ""My position concerning God is that of an agnostic. I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment."" Einstein also stated: ""I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth."" [...] Einstein clarified his religious views in a letter he wrote in response to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal god and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.</i>",1233587795

I know there are already some ""how to learn to program"" threads on HN but I feel like they are not helping with my decision. I'm a 25 years old business student from Germany and I will graduate this year. I already have an MBA degree from an American university. However, my big passion is the Internet and Internet startups. I'm also the co-founder (<10%) of a startup in Germany where I'm responsible for business development. I'm really enjoying what I'm doing and I'm planning to start my own Internet startup after I graduate. However, I'm not happy with my lack of skills in coding/web development.<p>Sure, there is always the possibility of hiring programmers or getting a programmer as a co-founder for a startup, but I would really prefer to be able to test my ideas myself and not just to be the ""business guy"" who's crunching the numbers. However, I know that it's a long road to learn coding and I've already made the decision in life to be a business guy. Usually my attitude is that it's never too late to learn something, but I'm not sure whether learning to program is the right choice for me. It would take years before I would be a decent coder and somehow I feel like doubting the path I've chosen (--> business).<p>I would really like to have your opinion on this. Should I just focus on business or should I just do it and learn to program?<p>Thanks,
Malte<p>P.S.: Even though I've studied in the United States, my English is far from being perfect. So please ignore typos etc if possible. ;)",1233587489

I don't think its malicious, but there must be something in peoples psyche that makes them think you've done a favour.  What I have now are set rates where I might discount slightly for friends, but not substantially. I also try not to take on jobs that are too small now.<p>I've also always found that lawyers can often exacerbate a situation.

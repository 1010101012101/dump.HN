699124,comment,698996,698996,0,0,trezor,,,"I see the hype around scaling has now reached so massive heights that even Google is willing to misattribute it to mean things that it doesn't if they think it makes them look good.<p>That Android over time may get a higher market adaptation has nothing to do with scaling. If I were to take on Google's interpretation here, Symbian would seem to scale better than any other mobile OS, and I'm not even sure what that would mean.",1247317067

699121,comment,698996,698996,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Marketers use the word ""scale"" the way Star Trek writers used the word ""phase"".<p>Cue Inigo Montoya: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""<p>And even if you ignore the poor choice of words and the inane anti-iPhone spin (what, the iPhone OS won't run on products besides iPhones? I'm <i>typing</i> on the iMac that disproves that point!) what I see here is Google trying to put a positive spin on one of their platform's big <i>problems</i>: Android not only <i>can</i> run on a thousand kinds of hardware, but that appears to be the official plan. Some of that hardware will have physical keyboards. Some of it will not. Some of that hardware will have screens the size of a dinner plate. Some will not. The result is a loss of coherency: What kind of hardware is an Android app for? What is Android for?<p>If you build an Android app, you have to decide if you'll optimize it for a physical keyboard on the long edge, or a physical keyboard on the short edge, or a software keyboard. You'll have to decide how much of the screen you can take up with your control panel. You can't optimize for everything at once.<p>The likely outcome is that you'll have to support your Android software on a divergent set of hardware, and you'll inevitably disappoint a subset of your customers. If the customer base breaks into thirds and you can only please one-third at a time, you will routinely disappoint <i>a majority</i> of the customer base no matter <i>what</i> you do.<p>The fact that the iPhone has one consistent hardware platform is a <i>big advantage</i> for Apple. The newest iPhone OS runs great on my two-year-old original-edition iPhone. The phone is getting better by the month: The interface works better, the crashes are fewer. This is presumably because Apple's engineering team can focus on refining the current platform rather than on porting their OS to a dozen different platforms.",1247316748

699119,comment,698753,698924,0,0,colomon,,,"You know, I'm very happy for you that your work lets you show real results to customers every week of development and get meaningful feedback.  That's awesome.<p>But before lecturing the rest of us, you might want to consider that not everyone's work works that way.  In my own work, it is not at all unusual to go weeks without having anything that could be usefully shown to a customer; and by the same token, the customer's desires are usually simple and unchanging.<p>Let me give you a concrete example: importing the geometry and topology from a Parasolid XT file.  Now, the good news is that the file format is publicly available.  The bad news is that it more or less amounts to a direct serialization of their internal data structures, in a format where there is absolutely no room for error: a single misread byte will make the rest of the file unreadable garbage.  And of course, every version of Parasolids (there are 75 or so now) used a slightly different format, and a number of crucial details were left vague or thoughtfully undocumented.<p>As you might suspect from that, it took well over a month to get the basic file parser done.  What was I going to show the customers in that?  Me: ""Well, here's the dump of this file as I parse it now.  As you can see, it gets completely screwed up about three-quarters of the way through.""  Customer: ""That's great progress!  But we've been talking it over, and we think your debugging dump should be colored chartreuse.""<p>That would be the norm for my work.  On shorter things (adding a simple new feature or fixing a simple bug), it usually takes less than a week, and we get as much feedback from the customer as possible.  On longer things, usually the customer's only feedback is ""We want to read these files"" and there is little meaningful I can show them in the middle of the project.",1247316464
699118,comment,698477,698613,0,0,trezor,,,"<i>Compare to the disaster of IE which sometimes looks at the file extension to decide how to display the document - that caused me huge problems way back.</i><p>Agreeing with most of your post, I think you are wrong on this one.<p>IE will do lots of stuff to detemine what kind of data it is actually getting from the server, somewhat overriding the http spec. Even if something is served as a appliction/octet-stream, IE might resort to looking at the extension of the URL (or the content-disposition header, if one is present).<p>If these checks fails, it will resort to MIME sniffing, by analyzing the first 256 bytes of the file to see if it can figure out what kind of content it contains. This method is surprisingly accurate, and you can test it yourself. [1]<p>In my opinion IE does a <i>lot</i> of things to make life easier for it's users to overcome problems caused by people configuring their <i>servers</i> incorrectly, something which is getting increasingly common.<p>I don't think IE deserves to be ridiculed over this extra effort.<p>[1] For some demo-code you can try out, check the following link: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510?sort=oldest#sort-top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510?sort=oldest#sort-to...</a>",1247316263

699102,comment,699082,699082,0,0,brk,,,"This is a poorly written article, IMO.<p>The author chides Googles for having two OS's with overlapping marketshare, yet seems to forget about WinCE, XP, XP Embedded, Vista.  There is certainly more than a bit of overlap there.<p>And of course, like every other upcoming version of Windows for the last 15+ years, this next version (Windows 7) is going to be the end-all OS, with all the bugs and issues and whatnot worked out.  We heard that about Windows 95, and 98 and 2000 and XP and Vista, yet it never really seems to hold true.<p>I personally think Google has a really solid shot at this.  Microsoft just doesn't get it, their overhead is too large to allow them to charge a fair price for the product and still turn a profit.  Apple is their own island and (IMO) doesn't really want or need to be a threat to the computing world at large, they target a successful and profitable niche.  Linux is just too disjointed to ever become mainstream, that ship has sailed.  But Google, they have the R&D power, the marketing savvy and the ability to create a universal OS that could directly challenge the Windows franchise, and I think the world is ready for it.<p>Google has developed so much of their own technology already, that an OS is probably not a major departure for them.",1247314696

I guess that is what you get when you are not looking into making the world's biggest companies, but into contributing the society. No one will hear about you.<p>In Tesla's museum in Belgrade, his notes are absolutely stunning. He invented the radio (later development leading to TV), remote control (tele-commanding a boat model), generator and polyphase AC... It is interesting to note the work that is leading towards the revolution Einstein is known for.. Tesla was a mean hundreds of years before his own time, and while moving towards the final ""theory of relativity"", his work suddenly stops, and is being scratched off. He never was an inventor of weapons, and it is claimed that he knew where such invention could lead. After all, what good did Einstein do? Millions killed, and devastating nuclear waste from energy extractions.<p>The only war-kind of invention was the EM shield that could protect a whole country from attacks, and he was proposing it to the Serbian king in Belgrade.<p>Basically he is behind everything we geeks care about today. Yet, he is considered ""American""??? Until his last day he was loyal to the king, the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians later to be Yugoslavia. He was not born in Austro-Hungaria, as the region was invaded by them at the time after the lengthy wars, later to evolve in the WWI. He was a Serbo-Croatian.<p>Americans used him, stole all of his patents and made an image of him in public as a crazy man. Not a monument or anything until much later at Niagara through the efforts of the Yugoslavian immigrants in the US.<p>I want to high school in the US (senior year). Not one single person knew who he was, and everyone thinks Edison invented ""electricity."" Not much to complain actually, they also don't know who Alessandro Volta is, speaking of US education.<p>Thank God we've all heard of P Diddy.",1247314375

If you happened to decide the BBC's goals were becoming contradictory to your own then who knows which way you'd bend? The point is YOU would be in a position to say yes or no to their needs, and no offense but to tell a very large company like the BBC, ""trust me, I'll make sure you're happy, now build all your web pages on top of my library"" is not particularly reassuring.<p>And I don't think anyone has to be a mindreader to know what you'd say if they submitted a patch that meant you'd have to lose some of the selectors you now support and run more slowly in order to add support for a browser with 1.5% market share.<p>They looked into it and determined it wasn't cost effective to maintain a parallel fork. Okay, whatever. Their needs are unique and they came up with a unique solution, so what? This isn't a zero sum game.<p>> C'est la vie.<p>Indeed.

8673282,comment,8673066,8673229,0,0,jcrites,,,"DMARC helps you most in two situations: (1) you&#x27;re a person or organization with an Internet presence that&#x27;s crucial to you, where it&#x27;s especially harmful for spammers or phishers to trick people by impersonating you (2) You&#x27;re on the receiving end of the attack.<p>If I recall correctly, PayPal helped put DMARC together since large numbers of their customers were being phished. &quot;More than 25 million email messages spoofing PayPal were rejected during the 2013 holiday buying season&quot; according to the DMARC site.<p>I agree that it may not be worth the bother to enable DMARC until there&#x27;s a lot at stake when protecting your domain. SPF is easier to set up, offers reasonable protection, and is widely adopted. DMARC&#x27;s best value comes from helping to protect large, important domains, for whom intelligence about impersonation attacks or misconfigurations can be valuable. For the domains that I&#x27;ve helped protect I think DMARC has been worthwhile.<p>It&#x27;s also true that DMARC breaks compatibility with common email use-cases like forwarding. However, if we are to move forward in email security, it can&#x27;t remain possible for every person to originate email claiming to be anyone else, which is what email lists and forwarding do in some cases.<p>We need a sensible way to take a message from Bob, validly signed by Bob, and wrap it so that I can send it on to you, perhaps with some added content at the beginning and end, or quoted, and additionally signed by me; so that you know the part claimed to be from Bob is really from Bob; and you know that I really forwarded it and wrapped it with my content. If we could solve the forwarding use-cases, I think that would remove the primary bottleneck to adoption.<p>The minimal bar to setting up DMARC is not high. The monitoring features are optional. A minimal DMARC setup is a policy saying that email from your domain will be authorized by SPF or a DKIM signature; a DNS record with this statement enables receivers to drop email lacking these proofs of legitimacy.<p>Did you know that SMTP includes no provision to determine whether a sender is allowed to send email from a domain? All anti-impersonation authorization logic has been bolted on later through protocols like SPF, SenderID, DKIM, and DMARC. DMARC is the first protocol to achieve meaningful adoption that protects the &quot;From&quot; address that you see in email clients from impersonation. DMARC is consequently the first protocol to provide an actual guarantee for receivers of the authenticity and integrity of email sent from your domain. Anti-spam systems predominately work around the lack of widespread adoption of these capabilities by correlating lots of factors; I suspect anti-spam would be slightly easier if strong domain-level message authenticity was common (for whitelisting if not blacklisting).<p>Email could use an evolution in a similar fashion to the recent standard updates for HTTP and HTML.",1417243998

There can be numerous subtle ways that timing information leaks while the code appears to be constant time.  And programmers who touch sensitive code can easily forget the requirement for constant-time behaviour.  Yes, having constant time operation without clamping is the best solution but it seems too easy to accidentally slip from this ideal.<p>I&#x27;m leaning toward the approach of having a simple clamping library at the application level that (a) throws an exception if the sensitive code takes longer than the &#x27;clamp time&#x27;; and (b) has some simple heuristic to determine the clamp time, such as &quot;double the maximum execution time recorded during the first 20 runs&quot;.

      char c[x];

I&#x27;m pretty sure there is no way to do that in C, but I&#x27;m wondering if a bit of (Intel) assembly could give me something re-useable from a C context. Any ideas?",1417242085

Typical of the kind written by western scholars without a single shred of understanding of the chinese culture. The chinese culture is one which places emphasis on the cream of the crop i.e. the top scholars, scientist etc. Politicians usually rise to power through connection or by slowly working their way up. This is completely contrary to those of the west where politicians are usually those who are the best at convincing people, not chosen because of their ability. The west worships democracy and condamns china for it single party rule, yet they set double standards when it comes to human right abuses such as guantanamo bay.

8673213,comment,8673066,8673166,0,0,jcrites,,,"True. The email community ought to put more thought into the interaction between email auth technology and email lists or email forwarding. Lists or forwarding can break DKIM and DMARC, for example. Yahoo users ran into trouble earlier this year when Yahoo enabled DMARC strict mode [1].<p>Idea: perhaps a way to allow forwarders to wrap existing content with a header, footer, or quoting, such that the receiving client displays the parts consecutively, but can reason about them independently. A bit conceptually like iframes. Display the author of each part, perhaps with a visual lock and boundary if signed.<p>On the other hand, there are adoption obstacles to introducing new email technologies, similar to the obstacles to evolve HTTP / HTML. Furthermore, email lacks as strong a steering leadership as browser vendors provide in the website space, and the market is more fragmented than the browser market is (varieties of webmail clients with differing display and validation capabilities). Since sensitive information is sent through email less commonly than through web browsers, there appears to be less demand and less genuine interest in email security technology than website security technology, making the adoption challenge for security technologies even harder. Although support for SSL in email delivery is rising [2], most delivery connections are protected by opportunustic TLS (which has many known weaknesses). A good starting point would be a widely-adopted standard for receiving domains to declare that they support TLS and perhaps pin their certificate, so that senders can require TLS.<p>[1] <a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/postmaster/yahoo-dmarc-policy-sln24050.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/postmaster/yahoo-dmarc-policy-sln2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/saferemail/</a>",1417241091

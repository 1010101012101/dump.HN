The primary interest of unions is to preserve for their members jobs that pay above-market compensation.<p>The presence of teachers' unions means that teachers see teaching as an industrial factory job in a mature field where no more innovation is possible. Students in such a world are the products of the factory. They come into the school system at 5 years of age as unprocessed raw material and they exit 12 years later as high-school graduates, ready to take on a job.<p>This whole mindset is wrong. The industrial-factory model of schools should be abolished. People, whether young (students) or old (teachers), are not fungible. They should not be viewed as factors in factory. They are not.",1298642371

Do we pay teachers who choose to work in more challenging schools less (and more likely have lower grades but possibly greater impact on students' lives with their successes)?<p>What do we do with teachers hand picking elite classes to improve their perceived performance?

It's the way it was with AOL, and maybe something will kill it eventually, but it's the way it is now.<p>I look forward to seeing where it will go, and I hope it's better than anything we can currently imagine.<p>It probably will.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:<p>When I clicked the link I got:<p><pre><code>    You are using an incompatible web browser.\n    Sorry, we're not able to support your browser.\n    Please use one of the following browsers:\n\n      * Mozilla Firefox\n      * Safari\n      * Microsoft Internet Explorer \n</code></pre>\nI'm using a very old Firefox.",1298639331

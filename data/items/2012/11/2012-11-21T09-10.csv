Very densely populated areas like new york are already reasonably served by a metro - scaling that system might be cheaper and equally effective as the hyperloop described by jacques mattheij. building new tunnels is very expensive and would probably account for most of the costs in this endeavor. additionally finding spare space in dense cities to construct such a hyperloop might be very difficult besides existing sewer systems and electrical lines, offsetting the benefits of the hyperloop (after all this would require massive public funding)<p>expanding this system to long distances would be really interesting, however even more expensive, given the need to construct long tunnels or tubes.",1353491836

Code and sentences can say the same things in different ways - what's the one that minimizes misinterpretation while remaining concise and interesting to read?

But make no mistake, scalability of component interaction <i>is</i> an issue, just a solved one (for those that see REST for what it is).<p>The solution is: specify an input scheme (for a hand calculator: put the first number, then plus, then the second number, then equals) and let the user choose the inputs.  This saves you from the (intercomponent-unscalable) combinatorial explosion in which you have to give the user a link to every possible computation as they navigate the interface, and which is the REST method.<p>So, any exposed function in which you can't feasibly blast every possible input set over the network is REST-incompatible, so I guess the <i>serious</i> RESTers don't think you should do it.

The important currency (the gem thing) can in large part be obtained from in-game achievements. Not in huge quantities, but...<p>2. It really only works as an accelerator: more builders, instant purchases and (in the last update) work acceleration. And the game does not hammer you with it at all, as opposed to some others I played in the past.<p>3. The one thing that shocked me the most, as you progress in the game <i>it starts requiring less of your time</i>. A good example is the collector things, they produce at a fixed hourly rate but store their production for collection so you don't have to open the game and click it every 10 mn, but more interestingly the internal storage grows faster than the production rate: the level 1 thing can store 2.5h worth of production, at level 6 it grows to ~15h.<p>> every action prompts a IAP (wait or pay)<p>That's not even true, when raising or upgrading buildings for instance there's only one flow, the IAP comes after that by reselecting the building itself after launching the action. There's surprisingly little prompting for consuming the crystal things, and I've yet to see a single in-your-face full-screen dialog suggesting buying these gems explicitly.",1353489006

I also never did the mistake you mention myself, despite the UI so flawed.<p>And i've observed that most people start by adding the recipients first, then content, then subject and then maybe in the end they decide to add a CC.

On the other hand, if the people you say it to, suffer as much or more, than it will hurt them. This is the short term effect.<p>On the long term, the real benefit of sharing such types of feeling is that other people get prepared for the hurting feeling in a similar situation. This generates an inhibition effect which is today best transmitted by films. This is not entertainment.

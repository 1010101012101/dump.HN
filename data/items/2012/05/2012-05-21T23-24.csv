""Hes referring to laws of nature of course, but lets take a step back and imagine that society is a scientific enterprise. Discovering good legal rules, good regulations, or good constitutions is hard  they are not given to us. They evolved. They appeared through different experiments in different places at different times, by different people. They will continue to change.""<p>I think that's stretching it, and going towards the dangerous territory of framing social debate as if it were a science, and as if the 'disruptive innovation by entrepreneurs' was scientific experiment.<p>I think Feynman was exacting about what could be considered an experiment.   From his commencement address, on 'cargo cult science', which covers this general area:
""I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person--to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know the the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control.""<p>He also points out that it can be bad to use the language of science, if you aren't really doing science:
""Another example is how to treat criminals. We obviously have made no progress--lots of theory, but no progress--in decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to handle criminals.
Yet these things are said to be scientific. We study them. And I think ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience. A teacher who has some good idea of how to teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it some other way--or is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her method is not necessarily a good one. Or a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or another, feels guilty for the rest of her life because she didn't do ""the right thing,"" according to the experts."" <a href=""http://www.physics.brocku.ca/etc/cargo_cult_science.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physics.brocku.ca/etc/cargo_cult_science.php</a><p>I'm not saying the article is making the mistake of cargo cult science; but just that it seems to be skirting a little close to that territory, by applying the language of science to situations in which people are not trying for rigorous experiments, and where isolating variables is particularly hard.<p>I don't think that disruptive innovation by entrepreneurs would meet Feynman's definition of science.  I like the framing of a startup as a company set up to test a hypothesis about a business model, but I think there's a distance between entrepreneurship and science.",1337644509

It has been around for quite a while.<p>They are pretty good pieces of kit; but there is something of a limit in terms of the information they can extract (i.e. because phones are so ""proprietary"" it's only logical data they can easily recover).<p>> Until now, officers had to send mobiles off for forensic examination in order to gather and store data, a process which took several weeks.<p>Hilarious.<p>Anyway:<p>In a sense this is very old news (over the stuff HN is likely to be interested in); before if your tech was seized and sent of for analysis the data would be retained, no matter what the outcome. I can't remember the exact length of time but it is measured in years.<p>This appears to be extending the technical ability to ""acquire"" mobile phones down to the police station level. My thoughts:<p>* Despite how simplistic (and the Aceso is brain dead simple to use) they make it, there will still be mass confusion<p>* No one at police station level will understand how to secure digital evidence effectively (no matter how much training they hand out - it took me several years to get to grips with the minutae), I hope they have a plan to mitigate this.<p>* This is all part of the govt. plan to in-source as much of their forensics as possible. Which just ends up putting the technical stuff in the hands of people ill-trained to handle it, and risks more people being convicted<p>* It's not discussed, but I would be interested to see if this means they will be acquiring <i>more</i> data than usual. i.e. does this mean every phone will be analysed, or will they only do it for phones they could (in the past) justify sending off for detailed examination.<p>* In the former case (acquiring everything) how, legally, are they justifying it.<p>As a forensic analyst this whole thing seems to verge on violating every ethical and moral rule I would ascribe too. It increases the chances of abuse by many factors and reduces the effectiveness of forensic mobile phone work.<p>> The cost of leasing the 16 terminals for 12 months and training the officers will be 50,000, the Met said.<p>They are being ridiculously fleeced. I am unsure of the exact volume of phones they might process, but I suspect they could sub-contract it to actual experts for much less. I could process 10's of phones a week, for example.
Mostly this is a Radio Tactics press release.<p>Even in the best case scenario they are reducing effectiveness, increasing error rate and costing themselves more money. From my side of the fence this is not the first idiotic thing I have seen the public forces do in recent months - and it won't be the last. As a member of the public I don't feel paranoia and insecurity, but I am certainly cautious about the way this is going.<p>(disclaimer; this sort of thing is what is making my profession redundant)<p>p.s. put a PIN code on your SIM and phone.

There are just some industries that lend themselves better to this kind of marketing than others. Ecommerce sites are in this category. Generally speaking, if you provide a service that cannot be done by web app then social media marketing doesn't work well. That's generally. Think of pool cleaners, housekeepers, gardeners, nannies, car washes versus any ecommerce product or services like web hosting, online insurance, travel bookings, etc.<p>The web is all about instant gratification. If what you're selling can't be delivered over broadband you're going to have a you time. You have to set up your product to be available as an impulse buy or your chances are slim. On the other hand, when people use search engines not only are they more likely to have intent but if they're specifically looking for your product or it's category they're more likely to be prepared for a non-instant buying experience. This is where those physical world service providers fare far better.

And by that I mean that one of the things video games have over programming (what I had previously spent 12 hrs on a Saturday doing for fun) was that in the game everything is set up so that you can get right toward making progress against your goal, and you can stop, and then come back later and get right back into it. From power up to 'engaged' was like 3 minutes, vs programming which seemed to have an hour just to get to the point where everything was in shape to work on it.<p>Since that time, I've been trying to make programming as easy as gaming in that regard. Things like 'screen' can help since you can pop right back into a session, everything is setup your cd path is current, as is your history etc) and stuff like picking one editor and using it everywhere helps too. A USB keyboard is essential because switching between Macbook keyboard to desktop keyboard can generate a lot of mistyped keys. Finally there is the 'questing' system, where in the game you log in and the quests you have to complete are sitting there in a list with a short note about what needs to be done. I use a notebook for that but it has the same effect.

Pass it around and people can have some fun.  I get it.<p>On the other hand, I echo some of the sentiments expressed by others who have experience actually playing guitar.  I play classical guitar and have been teaching my kid the same.<p>Once you get past what I call single-note-at-a-time pieces progress into more interesting music requires real work.  On the guitar, just like the piano, fingering is of paramount importance.  Without developing an understanding for this you'll twist your hand into a pretzel and simply will not be able to advance.  Then there's proper right hand technique, which is different between and electric with a pick and classical or finger-style.<p>The guitar has weird and difficult simultaneous left hand finger motion that one must drill and learn.  I suppose they could include such drills in the app.  My favorite source of pain for both left and right hand training is ""Pumping Nylon"" by Scott Tennant.  Most who know the subject would probably agree.<p>Reading written music is, in my opinion, very important and --I'll venture that far-- the only way to go.  Tab is cool, but why go there if reading actual musical notation isn't that hard at all.  As someone mentioned, there's a ton of information in a score.  Scores written for guitar, particularly at the beginner level, include right and left hand fingering as well as all sorts of other notations.  All of my sheet music has copious notes on pencil as I learn the pieces.<p>A neck full of LEDs just can't take you very far at all.  I'm sure I could be fun, but there's a real brick wall that'll make the fun stop pretty quickly.<p>That said, if something like this inspires the player to move up and learn the right way then I am all for it.  I might actually get one just because I'm a sucker for gadgets, but it will be just that: a fun gadget to bring out, show off and possibly take camping.

The benefits would be enormous to everyone- you are pushing the very boundaries of what's possible, you are going to uncover some interesting new tech along the way. If the US got into a massive space race with China (sending a manned spacecraft on Mars for example) the benefits would be felt globally for decades.

A former trial lawyer.<p>This differs from donating to the EFF in that you have a say over what specific cases you want to invest in.",1337641703

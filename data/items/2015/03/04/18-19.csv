As we&#x27;re seeing more and more on HN, there&#x27;s a huge amount of people in the tech industry who are in it for reasons that do not include a passion for technology, writing code or developing things.<p>So you&#x27;ve a huge amount of people fairly dissatisfied with what they&#x27;re doing 40+ hours a week, in an area full of similar people, and who have the disposable income and time to look for more in life outside of those 40+ hours.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising more cultural/outdoor/etc. things are flooded with people from the tech industry in SF, I suppose, where elsewhere they would be both less people in the industry and those that are would be slightly better geographically dispersed.",1425495589

Management is explicitly not looking for an exit: they just want to keep building this company for the long term.  My salary started on the low side for my career, but was reasonable, and it has slowly ratcheted up over time to the point where I think it&#x27;s certainly fair but I could be making more elsewhere.  On the whole, it feels like I have a large chunk of (potential) ownership in something very successful.<p>My question is: how does this actually benefit me in the big picture?  I&#x27;m approaching the 10 year date when my options agreement is going to EXPIRE, and it&#x27;s still unclear to me whether I should exercise them, because as far as I can tell, they&#x27;re just very expensive (when you consider the tax implications) paper.

9146442,comment,9143255,9145370,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"There&#x27;s a long history here. An abridged and slightly biased / not complete story follows.<p>In the beginning, Rust had only green threads. This was because concurrency was deemed important, and everybody knows green threads are where it&#x27;s at. (totally not sarcasm. Totally.)<p>Eventually, it was decided that a systems language without systems threads is... strange. So we needed to add them. Why not add choice? Since the interfaces could be the same, why not abstract over them, and you could just choose which one you wanted?<p>At the same time, the problems with green threads by default were becoming issues. Segmented stacks cause slow C interop. You need a runtime to manage them, etc.<p>Furthermore, the overall abstraction was causing an unacceptable cost. The green threads weren&#x27;t very green. Plus, with the need to actually release someday looming, decisions needed to be made regarding tradeoffs. And since Rust is supposed to be a systems language, having 1:1 threads and basically no runtime makes more sense than N:M threads and a runtime. So libgreen was removed, the interface was re-done to be 1:1 thread centric, and Servo got mad. That&#x27;s another story.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that green threads are evil. Remember, I/O isn&#x27;t a language thing, really, it&#x27;s a library thing, in a language as low-level as Rust. In fact, that&#x27;s one of the reasons green threads could be removed: libraries like mio could provide the benefits, without the problems that were being caused. Servo might also write a green threading library, with a different set of tradeoffs from mio&#x27;s implementation.<p>Anyway, this is my pre-coffee explanation of the history. I&#x27;m being a bit silly, so please don&#x27;t read into any particular bit of language here, that&#x27;s just the high-level story.",1425495350

It provides reliable, verifiable unit of account without relying on any one actor to be trustful.<p>The blockchain absolutely does NOT verify that a person won&#x27;t lie to you to get your money, or that they won&#x27;t blow it all in casino once you send it to them.

9146386,comment,9144862,9144862,0,0,karpathy,,,"I really like this line of work and I expect will grow quite substantially over the next few years. Of course, Reinforcement Learning has been around for a long time. Similarly, Q Learning (the core model in this paper) has been around a very long time. What is new is that normally you see these models applied to toy MDP problems with simple dynamics, and linear Q function approximations for fear of non-convergence etc. What&#x27;s novel about this work is that they fully embrace a complex non-linear Q function (ConvNet) looking at the raw pixels, and get it to actually work in (relatively speaking) complex environments (games). This requires several important tricks, as is discussed at length in their Nature paper (e.g. experience replay, updating the Q function only once in a while, etc.).<p>I implemented the DQN algorithm (used in this work) in Javascript a while ago as well (<a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo...</a>) if people are interested in poking around, but my version does not implement all the bells and whistles.<p>The results in this work are impressive, but also too easy to antropomorphise. If you know what&#x27;s going on under the hood you can start to easily list off why this is unlike anything humans/animals do. Some of the limitations include:<p>- Most curcially, the exploration used is random. You button mash random things and hope to receive a reward at some point or you&#x27;re completely lost. If anything at any point requires a precise sequence of actions to get a reward, exponentially more training time is necessary.<p>- Experience replay that performs the model updates is performed uniformly at random, instead of some kind of importance sampling. This one is easier to fix.<p>- A discrete set of actions is assumed. Any real-valued output (e.g. torque on a join) is a non-obvious problem in the current model.<p>- There is no transfer learning between games. The algorithm always starts from scratch. This is very much unlike what humans do in their own problem solving.<p>- The agent&#x27;s policy is reactive. It&#x27;s as if you always forgot what you did 1 second ago. You keep repeatedly &quot;waking up&quot; to the world and get 1 second to decide what to do.<p>- Q Learning is model-free, meaning that the agent builds no internal model of the world/reward dynamics. Unlike us, it doesn&#x27;t know what will happen to the world if it perfoms some action. This also means that it does not have any capacity to plan anything.<p>Of these, the biggest and most insurmountable problem is the first one: Random exploration of actions. As humans we have complex intuitions and an internal model of the dynamics of the world. This allows us to plan out actions that are very likely to yield a reward, without flailing our arms around greedily, hoping to get rewards at random at some point.<p>Games like Starcraft will significantly challenge an algorithm like this. You could expect that the model would develop super-human micro, but have difficulties with the overall strategy. For example, performing an air drop to enemy base would be impossible with the current model: You&#x27;d have to plan it out over many actions: &quot;load the marines into the ship, fly the ship in stealth around the map, drop it at the precise location of enemy base&quot;.<p>Hence, DQN is best at games that provide immediate rewards, and where you can afford to &quot;live in the moment&quot; without much planning. Shooting things in space invaders is a good example. Despite all these shortcoming, these are exciting results!",1425494816

Reason one is wrong as both increase in transaction volume and BTC price are both not only possible but can actually be positive externalities that reinforce each other. The increase in transactions could lead to an increase in price as more people adopt BTC. This has already proven to be the case in the early history of BTC.\n2. See above. Once adoption increases, the incentive to convert to Fiat decreases thus making this problem gradually irrelevant once the market tips (the big if).\n3. The need for regulations: Obviously total garbage. No need to refute.\n4. Decentralization is better than monopoly central control. Legislators and Regulators are the only true monopolies. Market actors are not, so market based intermediaries will still have reasons to exist. This is not a necessary condition for widespread BTC adoption.\n5. Full decentralization and &quot;censorship resistance(aka freedom)&quot; are important when there is a threat of property confiscation, which will become increasingly relevant when states become desperate for more revenue (already happening).\n6. People don&#x27;t find daily utility in fast decentralized transactions? That is ludicrous.\n7. Trust. That&#x27;s the whole point of btc protocol.

But as I noted, the things he related were not accessible in any recorded medium, nor did I speak of them to Jim nor anyone else during the time I knew him. Prior to that, I lived in a different part of the country and was even out of the country for awhile. Some of the things I&#x27;m fairly certainly I never related to anyone at any time.<p>I was never intoxicated during the time I knew Jim – I gave that up several years prior.<p>Jim never claimed to be possessed, nor anything like that. He would have found the idea repulsive. On the contrary, he generally considered himself to have a privileged relationship with God – a not uncommon delusion among persons suffering from severe mental illness. At the same time, I never heard him justify his personal behavior on that basis. Generally, Jim seemed to believe that other people, especially the police, had serious moral and intellectual defects which caused them to misunderstand and persecute him. He also displayed paranoia (sometimes extreme, to the point of self-harm) about most everything and everyone.<p>Finally, I never gave (and don&#x27;t give) Jim a &quot;pass&quot; because I believe he was possessed. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure he was. The only thing I am certain of is that he displayed all the signs of serious, prolonged and untreated mental illness. I also thought he was deeply spiritually troubled – so I prayed for him a lot (still do) and I tried to encourage him to seek the counsel and ministry of a couple of wise pastors in the area. However, for all his hyper-religiosity, Jim displayed a strong aversion to church and to authority figures in general. The incident I described previously did make me consider that some aspects of his malaise might be related to demonic influence, and the events seems to defy a natural explanation, but I cannot presume to know for certain.",1425493182

Platform owners realized that they were in a race to make development as easy and cheap as possible for their platform, except for a few odd cases where that wasn&#x27;t in the best interests of brand image (game consoles, iOS).<p>Libraries are a different story, but if you look at e.g. C# development tools you&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re subsidized to drive adoption of Windows and SQL server licenses.  Java was an attempt to drive people to Sun hardware, and now Oracle is monetizing it with the Ask toolbar (I guess?).",1425492875

I do the database for a sequencing center (so essentially CRUD - though its a moderately complex schema), and I work with a lot of bioinformaticians.

Usually the quality of code is really bad (often the script will only be run on one or two data sets, so that&#x27;s not such a problem).<p>Now compare that to a decent web app written to a good standard. There can be orders of magnitude more complexity in the second, even if it is &quot;only CRUD&quot;.

Not too long ago — hell, 5 years ago, licensing a big, brand name engine (including Source) involved gnarly negotiations, NDAs, and a small mountain of cash. Then Unity came along and changed the game.&quot;<p>Unity did change the game. There have always been game engines and game makers. But Unity was the first big name engine, with complete tooling, to go free. Suddenly developers had access to a full featured game engine with little upfront investment. If the game failed, it wasn&#x27;t as big of a deal. If you payed the half a million for Unreal or Source, and the game failed, you had bigger problem.<p>Torque tried, but failed to compete. Blender, Orge 3D, Panda 3D, etc never became big name, widely used engines. They might be cheep/free, but good luck getting everything to work. The documentation and support just aren&#x27;t there.<p>Modding is different. Unreal and others included their editor so you could mod the game, but you couldn&#x27;t make a new game and <i>sell it</i>. You had to stay in the confines of Unreal/Half-Life/Warcraft/Starcraft. DOTA and Tower Defense came from the Warcraft 3 modding community, but they where still Warcraft 3.

So why do we tolerate databases as they are?<p>This isn&#x27;t true. Databases _can_ be those things, but that isn&#x27;t the definition of a database. Most of the databases I have worked and created do not use update or delete except to archive old data that is no longer in the working set.<p>And mutability isn&#x27;t always faster. Most of the time when people are championing mutability, it is because it is the most expedient (esp with their mental model), not because from a whole system standpoint it is actually faster.

3670222,comment,3669802,3670120,9,0,rdl,,,"Arbitrary configuration networked disk is Hard, probably harder than anything else AWS does.  Enterprise still spends a lot on storage (generally big hardware RAIDs, dedicated storage area networks, etc.).  1 GB of enterprise storage might cost 50-100x the base per-GB cost of the cheapest SATA disk, by the time you include all the costs.  No AWS customer wants to pay that much of a premium.<p>You can often build a storage system for a very specific purpose more more cheaply (maybe 3x the base drive cost?), like the Backblaze pods, or just figure the cost of adding 4-8 x SATA drives and software RAID 10 to each of your servers, but then you get to try to solve the filesystem problem, and have weird performance characteristics.  Plus, if you think EBS reliability is bad (it is), wait for the joy of statistically significant number of spinning rust drives in anything not designed with enough redundancy, and where some failures are correlated (trays failing at the same time, controller bugs, ...).<p>One of Google's big advantages was always their Google File System.  And GFS is a lot better for the specific loads in search than for the kind of loads applications like gmail impose.<p>Local instance storage is really the only performant and cost effective thing.  You can hang a lot more direct attached disk off your own server than off any AWS instance (1.7TB).<p>The other area where AWS kind of falls down is ""mad RAM"" servers.  I can buy 288GB RAM servers (18-slot) cheaply now (well, 144GB is cheap, 288GB is less so), and 2TB RAM is available (64-slot).  AWS tops out at 68GB for about 5x the lease payments on these servers (so maybe 2x the loaded cost after Reserved Instance discounts)",1331024382

Hopefully the interviewer realized that only  source code samples are a good positive indicator of programming prowess, the rest are fluff, nice to have, but fluff none the less.<p>The best programmer (I estimate he is the 10x at least) that I know, has no SO profile, no tumblr, no twitter. Pretty sure, he has not committed any patches to open source projects in recent years. He comes at work, gets more done in 5 hours than a team of 4-5 people, then he leaves to go home to his family. He is the one who can handle 100k project with ease (and probably 1million project). His knowledge of code and the ability to travel move up/down abstraction chain is astounding, he knows more about my source code than me, and he only has glanced on it a few times.<p>If he was looking for a new job, he would not be able to show the closed source he is working on, as it is a large embedded project.<p>Granted this is an edge case, but there are programmers like him out there.",1331024302

3670209,comment,3669568,3669568,15,0,kamaal,,,"Frankly speaking I interviewed for a bigMegaCorp last year which is pretty famous. Can't give out the name of the company for obvious reasons.<p>They first had a telephonic round and checked around my skills. They talked of my last projects and make me write some code. It went well. Then they invited me to have some onsite interviews. It was the most pathetic interview experience any body could ever have.<p>They gave me a laptop and made me code. Which I did. The first day they had three 1.5 hours session coding session based interviews. Of which I missed only on one question. They went pretty fine. They told two days later I need to go through more interviews, It was a another two coding sessions plus a database and common design pattern based interview which I also did well.<p>But they called in a week later and said I needed to come again. Frankly speaking my patience had ran out. But nevertheless I still went. Only to find I had to go through another three rounds. This time the experience was pathetic. Its was full of puzzles and memorizing arcane facts of various bits and pieces of software which I bet no productive programmer will ever have time for. It was puzzles and fact quizzing galore like I had never seen before. Coupled by one Algorithm interview and I bet they asked mathematics I had never heard of before.<p>Another week later they told me I was rejected. Now this is what I have a problem with. You want somebody who can build quality software, who knows his trade. Programming languages, Databases, Tools, design patterns, Quality and other daily stuff.<p>How the hell does it matter the guy doesn't know facts and puzzles? Frankly speaking I can learn that too! If I spend 30 mins a day reading the career cup ebook and other internet puzzle forums I can very well game the algorithm and puzzle rounds. But what will this every say about my skills as a programmer?<p>All this 'Github as a resume' , and 'Stackoverflow profile as a resume' work fine only in forums like these. Otherwise every interview has a puzzle and algorithm quiz round which has absolutely no relevance to the daily work of a programmer.<p>Honestly all big web companies claiming to hire the best are definitely hiring the most <i>knowledgeable</i> person. But none of them are hiring outliers, passionate and productive people who can do miracles. This also perfectly explains, why most of their innovation and growth happens through acquisitions and not in house innovations.<p>Because most companies have people who know a lot, but not necessarily who can do a lot.",1331023839

The reality of the hosting business is that different providers give different levels of service, and in a lot of industries you do not want your customers to know your costs, so breaking it out as a separate line item isn't always optimal.  Businesses actively try to avoid their product being viewed as a commodity.<p>There are also purchasing people in big companies who are paid to negotiate down quotes.  If you tell them there is only one price for EC2, and they can't get a 5% discount for a large order, they will in some cases have a perverse incentive to go to a more expensive (list price) provider who will give them a discount (so they appear to be doing their job), even if the total price ends up higher, or the service ends up worse.

3670156,comment,3666564,3667173,5,0,shubber,,,"""The alternative would be to make Rails secure by default, but that would mean pretty much nothing would work until you explicitly granted access where necessary.""<p>Given the amount of logging that occurs if you do set whitelist_attributes, it's not like this is a huge problem to fix.  And, that logging (and the fact that your app mysteriously doesn't work) serve as a loud signal as to what action to take.  On the other hand, the ""insecure by default"" solution is a silent and potentially catastrophic failure.<p>Compare to how brake pads squeal: even the least mechanically savvy driver brings their car to a mechanic when their pads are running thin.<p>Finally, the suggested fix (which, frankly, wouldn't have helped github) was simply to update the default generator to set whitelist_attributes, rather than merely including a comment to the effect.  The ""everything is broken"" list would be introductory guides, full stop.  So, novice developers would be held up until the guides could be updated with good security practice.  Experienced devs, who supposedly all know about this, wouldn't have any problem on new apps.<p>And the core team have basically said ""meh, too much trouble.""  Apparently, they haven't been chasing html_safe! calls through their views, which is frankly way more of a pain than attr_accessble'ing data fields.",1331022115

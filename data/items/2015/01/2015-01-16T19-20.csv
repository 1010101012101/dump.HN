8901288,comment,8900016,8900946,0,0,Someone1234,,,"> Is this not almost always the case on every technology breakthrough?<p>In the case of the hyperloop the technology isn&#x27;t too bad. We can likely build it without developing too much. Most of the technological problems are already largely solved in aircraft design.<p>In this case it is more a &quot;this cost literally too many resources&quot; problem. High speed rail is fairly simple, you clear land (expensive), flatten it, even it out, and then lay metal tracks with wooden/concrete sleepers.<p>With the hyperloop you&#x27;re literally building a tunnel that has to withstand weather including extremes, withstand negative pressure internally without crushing, transfer the weight/internal/external forces down to pillars, and yet still you&#x27;re left with the &quot;clear land&quot; problem as nobody wants to live under a hyperloop track, or have it blocking their natural sunlight.<p>Hyperloop might see some savings as it requires less land than high speed rail, but you&#x27;ll easily offset that by physically how many resources go into the tunnel and pillars (and raising the tunnels into position and sealing them).<p>If all hyperloop was was a tunnel in the sky it might be easier to imagine the financials making sense. But then you add negative pressures within, and you&#x27;re talking about aircraft skin the entire length of the thing, and then dealing with attaching these pieces of loop together on-site (so presumably double-riveting them like aircraft skins are, which is time consuming/expensive).",1421438382

8901286,comment,8900016,8901184,0,0,32faction,,,"> Where was this video a couple of days ago?<p>Usually when there&#x27;s an error or a failure on a mission, there will be an immediate lockdown of all PR, videos etc to analyze the problems first and understand what happened before the official release of material. This might seem trivial but I&#x27;ll type it anyway.<p>First off, if SpaceX released videos and didn&#x27;t know what happened, the press would obviously speculate and SpaceX&#x27;s brand would lose value somewhat. If the videos were released and the problem is a little harder to solve, well now you have a video of your error circulating and you don&#x27;t even know what to tell the press what happened.<p>If you watch the Mission Control footage during Columbia&#x27;s fatal reentry, when Houston realized the worst had happened, Flight Director Cain said over the intercom &quot;G.C., FLIGHT, Lock the doors&quot;. This was meant figuratively and literally; He told Ground Control to lock the doors of Mission Control so no one could leave, and that all information regarding the incident would not leave that room. Not even the President could enter that room after Ground Control locked the doors.",1421438356

8901258,comment,8894474,8894756,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I also used that book in college, it’s still sitting on my shelf.  It had some really fantastic discussion of things like wait states (NOP&#x27;s after branches or whatnot ) that fundamentally can&#x27;t be worked around because the propagation delay of the logic gates for one operation take longer than the delay of another operation.  It also talked about the dangers of long pipelines.  I feel sometimes that most of the &quot;progress&quot; since I graduated in 1999 has been to work around these bottlenecks with things like branch prediction and excessive caching, but the cost of that has been to largely ignore more lucrative opportunities in multiprocessing.<p>We probably should have moved to processors with distributed CPUs/ram so that computations could be done in-place with languages like Erlang, Go and MATLAB.  We should have ditched GPUs for general purpose DSPs also.  Computers today really aren’t much use to me because I want to experiment with parallel code like neural nets and genetic algorithms but my hands are tied (OpenCL/CUDA focus on the wrong abstraction level).  To effectively do that, I’d have to design a parallel processor with an FPGA first, say 256 MIPS cores with 4 MB of ram each at 1 GHz.  As little hardware as possible would be wasted on cache and interconnect, instead, cores would just have pipes to their neighbors and software would handle replication.<p>Does anyone know of an open source emulator/virtual machine for a processor like this that runs on ordinary slow hardware and high latency networks?  I visualize it as each core having its private memory space and the ability to open 4 sockets to its neighbors (someday 6 with 3D chips), with the global shared persistent storage showing up as a slow mount and acting as a software transactional memory for resetting and synchronizing the cores.  Spinning up another instance of the VM would connect another N cores.",1421438130

However <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/missions/schedule/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/missions/schedule/index.html</a> shows they are launching 3 new projects, they just aren&#x27;t the sexy science right now so don&#x27;t get all the cheering. You better believe there was a lot of ooo&#x27;s and aaahhh&#x27;s around the new Hubble photos. So they come out with something amazing like that, then you hear that the government (in 2004 mind you) is not willing to fund them enough to keep Hubble alive, combined with the feature of loss of human life from the 2003 Columbia disaster making them risk averse.<p>When we see SpaceX taking risks and making discoveries, or SpaceShipOne doing the same and exploding, but then the team keeps going, we cheer that, we rally around the against all odds determination to make space accessible.<p>NASA has done amazing things, but they are hamstrung by the government and their own bureaucratic growth. What once was a warm blanket in the space race is now being used to try and smoother them to death now that there isn&#x27;t a commercial or war time payout.<p></rant>",1421437882

8901214,comment,8898341,8900291,0,0,rada,,,"Practice is great! Girls want to meet guys as much as guys want to meet girls! Here is my take on how to do it respectfully:<p>1) Do not limit yourself to only the prettiest girls. The whole beautiful girl/rich guy dichotomy is ugly. Do you want to be seen as a full-spectrum human being and not just a walking wallet? Then see girls as full-spectrum human beings and not just tits on legs.<p>2) For god&#x27;s sake, do not set up a lose-lose situation for the other person. SeanDev&#x27;s practice method has two possible outcomes: if the girl does not like him, well then he just added to the endless stream of go-nowhere &quot;sales calls&quot; that she has to answer all day long; but if she does like him, then she feels sad and disappointed that he didn&#x27;t call for a date. The whole thing is just so... disingenuous and defeatist.<p>3) Practice in an environment where girls are actually looking to meet guys. Dating sites is one obvious example, bars is another. Ambushing women as they go about their daily business is problematic. Human interactions are complex and there are no scripts but the closer you can get to implied consent the better.<p>3a) It&#x27;s hard for <i>anyone</i> to meet sexually/intellectually/temperamentally compatible people on the street. I am a conventionally attractive woman; I&#x27;ve been approached on the street probably over 10,000 times (a totally unscientific but conservative back-of-the-envelope estimate) and I can tell you that it&#x27;s never led to anything. Bars and parties have better outcomes, and being out and about doing fun stuff has yet better outcomes. For example yoga and volunteering are over-run by women, at least in cities where I&#x27;ve lived.<p>4) The initial conversation with someone you want to get with is no different than the initial conversation with someone you have no interest in getting with. I think that&#x27;s the hardest thing for some guys to wrap their head around, hence all the weird &quot;cheat codes for women&quot; floating about. Social anxiety is a real thing but there is no rule that you need to hit on the prettiest girl in the room to get over it. I&#x27;ve practiced my social skills on strangers that I have no interest in, and it&#x27;s helped me a lot. Granted my social anxiety is not very high to begin with - if yours is debilitating, see a doctor, it&#x27;s treatable!<p>Speaking of social anxiety. I don&#x27;t want to re-open the whole Scott Aaronson debacle either but since you mentioned him I&#x27;d like to point out that he actually went to a physician to request castration as a solution to his social anxiety issues so we are talking about an <i>exceptionally</i> disturbed individual who attempted a full-on sexual suicide. The vast majority of people - men and women both - are not looking to &quot;kill&quot; themselves so I think it&#x27;s superfluous to bring him into this discussion. I don&#x27;t mean that as a jab, I just mean that it is unhelpful to mentally lump yourself in with someone like SA.",1421437778

If your dependencies are declared correctly, there is little danger of misbehaviour. The advantage to this is that parallelization is free and you never need explicit waits. In practice of course there will be misbehaving units and incomplete dependency declarations, but I think as admins gain experience with systemd those kinds of issues will drastically decrease. You&#x27;ll still be able to run plain old scripts from unit files. I do that on my home server to start containers. since the contained process doesn&#x27;t background itself and just prints to stdout and stderr, when started via systemd all its output will go into the journal and the tail shows up when I do &quot;service container@foo status&quot;.<p>Analogous to SQL, I suppose something like &quot;systemctl explain&quot; might be useful.

I see the big difference here as being between the people who think that the job of the OS is to provide a simple base for executing user-defined scripts, and well, everyone else. I think that an appropriate analogy would be handcrafted goods versus mass production. Linux has been transformed into a wide variety of products at various times, and while I don&#x27;t think the init scripts played a very large role in any of that, the idea that the OS is what you choose to turn it into does have strong credence in this community.<p>The other side of the debate, I think, are the people who feel like a collection of init scripts should be refactored somehow, and mostly this seems to involve rewriting things in C, adding dependency annotations to init files, and implementing support for cgroups. At least that&#x27;s what OpenRC has been doing. Systemd unit files go a step further, but it&#x27;s a good step in my opinion. Anything that any two scripts do should be refactored into a common method or library, and hopefully that process leaves very little for the init script or unit file to do.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter to me personally whether this stuff gets done in Bash or C; I can&#x27;t really maintain either. I could probably write a unit file if I had to. I understand there are lots of people who have put lots of time into writing Bash scripts. Some sysadmins may even think that their job is to write scripts. These people should continue to write all the scripts that they want, because Linux is all about that, but maybe they should also let other people write a decent plumbing layer for Linux, because modern OSes are all about that.",1421437268

Bush is, NASA/NOAA actually built a satellite to measure one of the most important unknown variables in Earth&#x27;s climate (&quot;albedo&quot; -- basically how &quot;white&quot; the surface of the Earth is when seen from space) but it has been stuck in a warehouse because the US administrations didn&#x27;t want to launch it. It is finally getting to launch <i>at the end of this month</i>; but it was completed in 2001.<p>Individual scientists might be able to &quot;prove&quot; arbitrary points in the sense of baffling people with things they don&#x27;t understand until they accept the scientist as authority. They could perhaps even &quot;prove&quot; in the sense of cooking up statistics to support an arbitrary point. But we&#x27;re not talking about an individual scientist talking to an individual person.<p>What&#x27;s instead happened is that a bunch of disparate scientists for disparate reasons have called attention to one central historical question (the trend of global average temperature); and a whole scientific research program has been created to investigate it involving lots of scientists at lots of institutions in lots of countries. That research program has confidently been able to conclude that those early scientists were wrong -- they predicted global cooling precipitating a new impending ice age -- and that instead we are going in precisely the opposite direction, and that the major causal force emerging in the models is a forcing term from CO2-emissions which have spiked dramatically.<p>This research program has also been able to identify several risk factors for runaway warming, which would be just as bad as runaway cooling. Slight warming and slight cooling are also both bad, mostly because the Earth is huge. So, I&#x27;m from a physics background and the basic problem is what we&#x27;d call &quot;relaxation to equilibrium.&quot; If you imagine a massive boulder which is stationary and you dig a hole next to it so that it rolls somewhat to the side, there are a couple of concerns. Only one of those is whether there&#x27;s an appreciable slope which will cause the boulder to roll uncontrollably downhill -- the &quot;runaway warming&quot; idea. But you can still get injured even if it doesn&#x27;t roll very far, if you&#x27;re in its way when it rolls -- and the bigger the boulder, the more momentum it will have to do that damage.<p>That&#x27;s sort of a two-minute way to understand why slight warming/cooling can enhance tropical storms and send parts of the polar vortex out over the US midwest: the Earth has a new equilibrium point for all sorts of climate variables which were functions of the global temperature, and as things relax to this new equilibrium they will potentially cause large weather upsets simply because the Earth is big.",1421437095

Problem is, no girls want to read your politicized feminist comics. Girls have their own thoughts and that causes a certain demand.  That demand probably isn&#x27;t large and historically girls mature earlier and are into reading novels (think YA and chick-lit) and comics don&#x27;t provide something they aren&#x27;t getting elsewhere.<p>I really hate how a lot of the people in this thread keep saying &quot;oh fix it&quot; and &quot;display more comics.&quot; That is fucking regulation there. Right now comic stores sell what sells.  This skirting of what you actually want to be done to get your outcome is weasel language.  Apparently, starting yoru own store and publishers is too much work, but SJW&#x27;ing on HN is just fine. Nothing like low-effort whining eh?<p>Retail space is limited so the lowest common denominator items will be sold to maximize profit. Its not a conspiracy against your values.

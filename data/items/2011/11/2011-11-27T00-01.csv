She contradicts herself within her first two sentences: she says America must welcome innovators, and then says the tired and poor as well. Which is it?<p>Mexico by far has been the biggest contributor of immigrants to the US in recent decades, yet it doesn't even rank within the top 20 nations with the most immigrant entrepreneurs. Mexicans are responsible for a total of 1% of the these immigrant founded companies in California. They number about 10 million in California, far more than any other immigrant group, yet they hardly rank as a source of entrepreneurs.<p>If growing the number of entrepreneurs is your only goal, asking the tired and poor to come here is a recipe for failure. Mexicans, despite their origins in poverty, have not achieved much in the way of tech entrepreneurship, relative to Indians, Taiwanese, Chinese, etc. Some countries are better than others in producing entrepreneurs.",1322355403

3281232,comment,3280498,3280498,2,0,extension,,,"Here is my trick for taking great photos:<p>Carry a small camera in your pocket at all times. ALL. TIMES. It has to be one that can turn on and take a photo within two seconds tops. You also have to be able to get it ready to snap the photo while it's still in your pocket, using touch alone. And the shutter has to react instantly when you snap the photo. Unfortunately, most smartphones can't do these things, but a Canon Powershot or similar style of camera can.<p>Now, whenever you get a sense that something interesting is about to happen or someone is about to do something amusing, put your hand in your pocket and get the camera ready. And when the moment seems right, whip it out and snap the photo <i>right away</i>. Do not let anyone know that you are about to take a photo before you shoot, not even an instant before.<p>This is the only way to get fly-on-the-wall photos when you are part of the action, which you usually are when you're with friends. Some people might get a bit annoyed at first, but they will forgive you when they see the great photo of them where they look relaxed and natural.<p>I've captured some strange and magical moments this way. It's a shame that my camera has been displaced by my phone, which can't do it.",1322355325

When there were 10 million of us, this wasn't a problem. When there were 100 million of us, this wasn't a problem. When there were 1 billion of us, it was <i>mostly</i> not a problem. Now as we zero in on 10 billion... it's becoming a problem.<p>The way our society and our economy works should in so many ways tell you this is true. Look at the urban decay that occurred in many American cities in the 20th century.<p>Urban decay post-WW2 was fuelled by the interstate system, the cheapening cost of owning a car and that it was cheaper to build new communities than it was to maintain existing infrastructure.<p>Some cities experienced negative population growth with devastating consequences (eg Detroit, Baltimore). Certainly in Detroit's case, there are large swathes of the city that really need to be returned to wilderness. But who's going to pay for the demolition, relocation and clean up?<p>The Western world is essentially dying with net migration being pretty much the only reason any Western country is growing at all. The social experiments of the early 20th century (ie state-funded retirement) are, at present rates, ultimately unsustainable when we get down to 3 or even 2 employed people pre retired person (initially it was in excess of 50 to 1 at least for Social Security).<p>An aging population is a natural consequence of slowing population growth, just like urban decay is. So far we've largely shown ourselves at being ill-equipped at dealing with either, except for politicking around migration, which basically just kicks that can further down the street.<p>It is my opinion that there need to be an awful lot less of us and there will be one day, one way or the other. As much as people point to space as a solution to these problems we have an economy built in basically digging not-that-deep holes for our metals. While there are metal-rich asteroids out there, the cost of moving, processing and using those materials is so many orders of magnitude more expensive (both realistically and conceivably) that I have to wonder if it will <i>ever</i> be comparable (although it might one day be viable just because every other way has become so expensive, which will be an earth-shattering adjustment for us all).<p>So migration is, I believe, a short term fix. But it doesn't address what I believe to be a key driver in unemployment: we're slowly automating our way out of the most unskilled jobs (and increasingly skilled jobs too). That too will be a challenge.",1322355001

I would not characterize the entire private insurance industry as an ""employer-provided insurance ghetto"" - what does that even mean?<p>The whole second paragraph makes it clear that you don't understand the complexities of the Healthcare industry. You provide very broad brush statements like ""allow insurance competition across state lines"", the complexities of that single issue alone are staggering. Are you aware that the strength of most in-state insurance carriers is their in-state network. An insurance company IS it's network. In addition each individual state has a Department of Insurance  which also regulates all carriers in that state. DOI rules and regulations vary from state to state. Expanding your coverage to another state is a very complex undertaking.<p>Also, Individual groups do have the ability to purchase healthcare - see many professional organizations(AIGA, etc) as working examples of this today.<p>In either case, making those changes won't just magically open the industry to ""the web and to innovative, competitive forces"". There are already competitive forces at play. Any new player attempting to join the fray faces an uphill battle just in the regulatory aspects of the business alone.<p>What do the advantages of the web and new technologies bring to insurance? How do these changes the provider networks which are the backbone of major insurance coverage today? These are the types of questions which need to be posed, and the people in the best position to answer these questions and change the game are insurers themselves. There are many smart and talented people working in insurance. The recent proposed Healthcare changes have helped to begin the process of moving forward and thinking differently, but with an industry like this it will take time.<p>It is happening, insurance providers are looking at new technologies and ways to provide the coverage that people expect, for lower costs, in new and different ways.",1322353907

With decreasing numbers of jobs, the old ""get a job to get money to get food"" solution breaks down.  An alternative solution could be for the government to provide a base level of necessities to the entire population.  For example, it is within our current technology level (the US overproduces food, and various farms lay unused) to provide a 2000 calorie per day ration to our entire population.  By replacing minimum wage laws and welfare checks, which simply drive inflation, with explicit grants for necessities (food, shelter, clothing) we can maintain higher levels of unemployment without perverting the capitalism-based incentive structures in other areas of our economy.  That is, we want people to be motivated to better themselves by the prospect of those traditional capitalist rewards, and we don't want a solution which simply gives raw money away because a percentage, perhaps a significant percentage, will be misspent on luxuries rather than necessities and would likely reduce motivation to seek gainful employment.<p>TLDR: A two-tier economy based on enabling luxuries for those who work and providing a ration of necessities for all members of the society, scaled by our technology level, will enable us to sustain the higher levels of unemployment driven by technological advances.",1322353655

Then, and only then, she makes the point that an entrepreneur visa for founders is a good idea.<p>The author uses immigrants' children/very young immigrants not immediately connected to the plan of starting a company to reference the entire immigrant demographic as a whole, since current US policies make it extremely improbable we can come up with good positive examples of a young immigrant starting a company, because US immigration rules prevent this situation from occurring.<p>Her logic is as follows:
-Fact: ""According to statistics from Partnership for a New American Economy, 40% of Fortune 500 companies were created by immigrants or their children.""
-Examples: Immigrants' children starting Fortune 500 companies<p>The logic here is using the immigrants' children to support the point that both immigrants and their children start companies, since the only direct immigrants who started the companies were either much older and already gone through the green card or broke the rules to start their company.<p>One of the major problems in our advocacy is that there is this big negative space that we /think/ can be filled. By definition, because it's a negative space, there are no positive examples to point to in making the argument. Positive examples strengthen any abstract argument, so they must be made. In this case, the author goes to young immigrants not immediately connected to startups to make the case that immigrants as a class make for good founders.<p>From there, the author makes one of her major points:<p>-Argument: US immigration prevents people from starting companies shortly after entering the country due to current visa rules

However, if there is such a way, it has certainly never been applied to date for the Eurozone. This is the grand experiment ongoing in the EMU.<p>In a sense, the experiment not only already failed, but failed from the outset due to states choosing to ignore leverage rules in the 1997 Stability and Growth Pact, including even Germany.<p>The probability of this ending well, or without Germans paying in some shape or form and potentially severely against their long-term interests, is low.<p>If Germany had any sense, they will be making preparations to leave at any time, possibly taking the few remaining Germanic (+Switzerland) and Scandinavian creditor nations with them too.",1322352401
3281127,comment,3279768,3281053,3,0,da-bacon,,,"It's an interesting question: how those who work on quantum algorithms think about quantum algorithms.  As someone who worked on quantum algorithms for many years, the interesting intuition that I developed was not what made quantum algorithms tick, but more along the lines of ""when is a method likely to NOT yield a quantum speedup.""  That is I found I could pretty quickly tell when I was doing something that had a nice classical analogy and was therefore doomed to failure.  Classic examples where when your intuition about why you might get a speedup involved exploring an exponentially large solution space without some reason that interference could be used to help dig out the interesting parts of the global superposition you created.<p>An interesting example of how one discovers a quantum algorithm is the story of the NAND tree algorithm (See <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=207"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=207</a> for a nice explanation.)  Quite literally the quantum algorithm was discovered by thinking about interference of particles hoping around, combined with physicists uncanny ability to calculate scattering cross sections.

Which court is going to force them to pay? And under which set of laws? Sovereigns can rewrite the law to change the terms of these contracts. What they can't control is how (allegedly independent) third-party ratings agencies rate their bonds, and declare whether a credit event has occurred or not (triggering insurance etc).",1322352323

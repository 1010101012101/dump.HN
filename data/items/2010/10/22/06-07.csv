Rapleaf's personalization service--which is designed to let websites personalize based on who is viewing the website--does not serve PII.  Instead, it serves targeting data like ""Age 40-50"" and ""Interests Basketball"".<p>The idea behind the Anonymouse project is that a person should not be able to be personally identified based on the targeting information served about them.  Only sets of targeting data which cannot be traced back to a unique individual is stored in the personalization cookie.<p>For example, it would be okay to serve a targeting cookie about a person which contained ""Male, Wealthy, looking to buy a Ferrari"", because thousands of people fit that description, and the ad network or website cannot identify the person with any reasonable specificity.<p>It would not be okay, however, to target a person as ""52 year old Male, makes $256,000, lives in Sometown OH, and was born on April 12th"", because in all likelihood, only one or two people fit that description, and the data would effectively serve as PII, and this would be no better than dropping a facebook ID in the cookie.<p>Let me know if anything's unclear, or if you want more details.  From a CS perspective, it's a really cool/hard problem, and something we've spent a lot of time on.  We're planning on writing an update blog post on where we are... as soon as we're done coding : )",1287730622

1818839,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,dasil003,,,"Let me echo the sentiments that TC isn't worth jack shit.  I am at a startup now that has been slogging it out for 3 years, slowly meeting people in the industry, doing deals, and building traction with the product one day at a time.  We've received a lot of press in various forms, the only ones that generated any lasting traffic were partnerships with big names.  The general news coverage (blog and print) was pretty worthless, with TC ranking near the bottom. That might not be true for tech-centric products like Twitter where the service itself is disproportionately useful to tech bloggers like Arrington and Scoble, and thus they gush all over the product for months on end with utter disregard for the uselessness of the product outside their own niche, but it's true for most products.  The bottom line is there are lots of ways to get the word out about your product, and media coverage is not anywhere near the best one.<p>The first thing you need to do is make your product compelling.  There is a reason for all the talk about rapid iteration, minimum viable product, and the lean startup; creating a compelling product is hard.  There is no formula for it, and customers are infuriatingly fickle.  It's hard enough with established markets for things people really need (eg. food, toiletries, houses, cell phones), but when you're creating something brand new there's this huge hurdle to get people to understand how it fits into their life.  There's no telling what will make something compelling, so you need to just put something out and iterate on it.  Get 5 customers, get 10 customers.  If these people find your product compelling and can give you real world feedback and evangelize the product, that is worth more than 50,000 visits from bored TCers who spend 5 minutes then jump to the next story.",1287729951

The Apple Java runtime has already been moving closer to the standard Sun one (i.e. default renderer was switched over to Sun's a couple of versions ago).<p>My guess is that we'll either see Oracle take back support for shipping a version, or Apple contributing to OpenJDK (like they do with X.Org) - having A version of Java available on OS X is necessary - but for the most part it is as a web server for developers, not for native GUI development - and it is the latter point where the differences are.<p>(Also doesn't SWT use a different approach to the same native look-and-feel end?)",1287729859

I'm from Toronto too (looked at your Twitter).<p>I'm a designer (though not kick-ass) so here is my input.<p>Design school is very different from one another. Some design schools focus on style while others are focus on conceptual development. Neither is inherently better than the other.<p>While you can be self-taught, I would say school was great for making important connections in my career and in exposing me to different subjects that would add to my creative arsenal (namely photography).<p>If you have a good eye, that's a great start. Having a sense of style is supremely important as a designer since having a creative vision is one of the core responsibilities.<p>I think some of the best resources are books that deal with some of the principles. Josef Muller Brockmann Grid System in Graphic Design is certainly one of the Holy Grail books of grids. Reading about Typography is also of utmost importance if you indeed to do web design, as it plays such a central role.<p>But I think some of the most important things are: doing a huge volume of work and getting critiques from designers who you respect. Both of these will help you get a feel of what is right and wrong.<p>And if you can, intern or work for an agency/studio for a bit. You'll learn TONS.",1287729531

Unfortunately, it also resulted in me taking a bunch of pictures of the inside of my pocket and some random dude on the bus, as I happened to sit in such a way as to trigger camera mode.

Microsoft has serious plans for multitasking, tethering, VPNs, and corporate security policies, etc""<p>- Microsoft's communication on missing features is making early purchasing decisions difficult, they could stand to improve communication.<p>- Some interface issues he doesn't like, in particular BING search doesn't search phone in its entirety.<p>- ""The integration of Facebook and Windows Live is fantastic"".<p>- Media management isn't awesome, highlights major problem with the integrated HUB is that MSFT must choose to support apps and standards which means most apps wont work, notably twitter not integrated yet.<p>- Curious that there's no native windows chat client.<p>- Windows 7 Mobile dev tools are good, but not great. Notably lacking ability to access camera, and compass, bigger concern is that the cool Windows 7 interface cues are missing forcing devs to recreate, making some apps look clunky and could cause repeat of Windows app clunkiness.<p>- He thinks the naming strategy is stupid, should have gone with ZunePhone, too tied to single release but clearly piggy backing on Windows 7 desktop success.<p>- Major complaint is missing features, features there executed brilliantly.<p>- ""Windows Phone 7 looks great, works well, and is a treat to use.""<p>Phew.",1287728006

This is true for the financial and time cost, as well as the resulting lost productivity and chaos created when having to hire, fire, and find a replacement.<p>Therefore given how ""picky"" companies have to be in hiring someone, they often have an order of magnitude more people to say no to than yes, and the earlier in the process you go the more orders of magnitude of ""no"" they have to reply with.<p>Thus it makes sense for them to only provide feedback if someone requests it explicitly, and because it also shows them that you are still interested and put some extra effort into the process.",1287727775

7963144,comment,7962715,7962859,1,0,tempestn,,,"How exactly would a negative tax bracket work?  Taken literally, this would mean that up to a certain income level, the government would pay you an amount proportional to how much you make.  Presumably what it actually means is that you would be paid inversely proportional to how much you make.<p>At first glance it seems to me that this would have one of the same problems as the current system, which a guaranteed basic income is intended to solve - a high effective marginal tax rate at low (or no) income levels.  (Unless the payment actually is positively proportional to earnings, in which case it has the obvious problem that it provides less benefit to those who need it most.)<p>Either way, I&#x27;m not clear on how this would be superior to a fixed guaranteed income with adjustments to the current tax rates such that the middle class end up with approximately the same after-tax total income.",1404089875

I think my response was measured and calm, clearly explaining why the comment in the original post was problematic, and furthermore adding information people might not be aware of (that Sodom wasn&#x27;t following modern &quot;not your business what consenting adults do&quot; practice; &quot;rape culture&quot; was alive and well there.)

7963130,comment,7962345,7962345,3,0,briantakita,,,"This article presumes that everybody <i>wants</i> an elaborate type system. I&#x27;m not sure that is the case. I still see an elaborate type system as incidental complexity. I may be in the minority and I may not have worked in domains which benefit from such modeling. Maybe I&#x27;m stuck in a blub paradigm.<p>Here&#x27;s my reasoning. I&#x27;m a fan of human language & domain ontologies. Word definitions are quite flexible & do not have an elaborate type system. I don&#x27;t feel the need to have a provably correct logical system to have a useful conceptual tool (i.e. analogies). I enjoy ambiguity. Ambiguity can lead to paradoxes, which in turn leads to exploration & novelty.<p>Strongly typed systems, by default, give me the impression that the domain ontology is figured out on a highly precise level. That is never the case. You can almost always go deeper. Domain language precision is tough to model & express.<p>I prefer data structures to drive operations. I suppose that a schema is often useful, however I don&#x27;t feel like I need the programming language to enforce the schema.<p>I also like to evolve the design, using tests. Tests are really examples to exercise the program&#x27;s API with expected I/O.<p>People often equate an evolved programming language/paradigm as being better. In the case of Javascript, they point out that is was created in a few days as evidence that it&#x27;s &quot;bad&quot;. The thing about an evolved language/paradigm is it has evolved down a certain path. That often means restricting the freedom of the programmer to evolve the program down another path. I&#x27;m not picking one way to be better than another. However, I do see tradoffs to both approaches. I personally prefer a more flexible language. It can be evolved, as long as the evolution does not restrict my freedom to evolve the program.",1404089459

For example, if you wanted to make a new site/network similar to StackExchange (but presumably with some revolutionary changes; not just a &quot;me too&quot; copy), you could start by adding an interface layer using the StackExchange API and adding some of your new smarts to give your users some of the benefit of your tool, on top of the StackExchange content.  Most likely you wouldn&#x27;t be able to add all the new goodness there though, so you would also do as other comments have suggested to build up your own content.  Maybe even incentivize users to add stuff based on StackExchange answers they find (assuming some manual intervention is necessary to make the answers suitable for your site - and also assuming you comply with terms of use and such).<p>It&#x27;s hard to give exact examples without knowing what you plan to do of course, but that&#x27;s the general idea.

Allowing a number of execution contexts to share a single thread, automatically relinquishing control when they initiate an operation whose result won&#x27;t be available for a while, can be a more efficient approach in certain circumstances.<p>Given that, I do respect what Microsoft was trying to do with async/await in C#. I&#x27;m not convinced they were entirely successful, though.

Don&#x27;t shy away from injecting a bit of personality in there and use your superior web-saviness to get better SEO, page-load times, responsive-ness and so on than what others already writing on the subject can do. A simple blog will suffice for the purposes of getting initial interest.<p>After a while a regular audience will materialize and they will start talking to each other in the comments. Some might even start offering spare parts to one another, uploading pictures and posting links to videos. Ideally they are drawn to your site to see what you have to say this week however they stay for the comments.<p>For this automotive analogy you would probably want real world community things, e.g. meet ups, galleries, a way for people to enable film-makers to hire their Model T&#x27;s, a supplier&#x27;s directory, a &#x27;wiki&#x27; and so on.<p>Once enough &#x27;user generated content&#x27; arrives you can move the &#x27;forum&#x27; (or whatever) to the homepage and relegate your original articles to some archive buried somewhere in the site.

A deliberate pivot is made and the original specialism broadened.<p>There are many sites that have grown with a variation of the above.

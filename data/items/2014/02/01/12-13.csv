In it, Seymour Papert mentions emotion and feeling as important concepts in mental model building[0]. You might find it an interesting viewpoint.<p><i>&quot;What an individual can learn, and how he learns it, depends on what models he has available. This raises, recursively, the question of how he learned these models. Thus the “laws of learning” must be about how intellectual structures grow out of one another and about how, in the process, they acquire both logical and emotional form.&quot;</i><p>It is also worth reading Papert&#x27;s colleague Marvin Minsky&#x27;s book, The Emotion Machine.

I have found that the only real differentiator in terms of retention and progress (as measured by the likelihood that a native speaker would mistake me as such in person or over text) was the quantity of time that I spent speaking to native speakers. This improved not only my spoken abilities but also my reading abilities, although there is no clear reasoning for why the latter occurred.<p>If at all possible, go to barbers that speak your target language. If you&#x27;re old enough to drink (or have a good fake) go to bars where your target language is spoken, start listening to news in the target language. Hell, if you&#x27;re single or have a particularly liberal significant other start dating a guy/girl in your target language.

Renting it a LOT of work and it isn&#x27;t for everyone. You have to find good tenants, but that is a crapshoot. Everytime someone moves out you gotta spend time getting the place ready for the next people, advertising it, then showing it. If your tenant stops paying you have to evict them, but that takes time and you lose money in the meantime. Then when you finally get them out of there, you can sue them for back rent and win a judgment, but if they don&#x27;t have any money to pay you with, you aren&#x27;t getting it. Once in a while you got a tenant who leave the place a BIG HUGE MESS that you can&#x27;t even imagine, that&#x27;s a few week job. Then you gotta deal with things like being woken up in the middle of the night when people have locked themselves out. If something breaks, it might costs thousands of dollars to fix. If you don&#x27;t have DIY skills and time, then the cost of labor is going to kill you.<p>If you are renting to more wealthy people, these things might not come up as often.<p>If you had LOTS of money, a property manager, staff, then it might be different, but not in any way risk free.<p>I have family who were doing a REAL lot of work just to break even at property rentals.

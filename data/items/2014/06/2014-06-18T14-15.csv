It was really used for Windows 3.0 which was a bit better. But the first majorly popular Windows release was 3.1, which was contemporary with the 486 (though it could run on 386s too).<p>C) The number of Windows 3.x users with direct Internet connections was awfully low. At that point everyone doing consumer-facing networking was on AOL and similar services. Associating &quot;Windows&quot; and the &quot;rise of the Internet&quot; gets you to at least Windows 95, which was a Pentium-era product.<p>I guess that intro statement doesn&#x27;t really matter to the project, which does seem kind of cool, but it&#x27;s also the first thing you read going to the page.",1403103582

I never considered suicide, but during a snowy winter where I also experienced financial pressure and a lot of family strain and changes, I very slowly slipped into a sort of &quot;fog.&quot;<p>I also became very sensitive, both to how people interacted with me, but even to physical things. I remember bumping my shoulder into a door one time and screaming, &quot;OW!&quot; It couldn&#x27;t have really hurt - my shoulder is plenty strong - I think I just wanted attention. It was a natural overreaction. I would get upset about things that, in retrospect, shouldn&#x27;t have really bothered me.<p>I also tended to wake up at 4am, filled with anxiety. I would tell myself to work, but really I would just waste time until morning came. You can&#x27;t really be productive or focused at 4am.<p>I never felt sad or happy. I just felt nothing much at all. I was completely unaware of this at the time, of course. Other people around me were very aware of it.<p>My mood really disabled me, which only made things worse.<p>I was hesitant and too embarrassed to seek medical help, so instead I privately got a hold of some over the counter treatments: specifically 5-HTP supplements and St. John&#x27;s Wort, if I recall. Although in retrospect I&#x27;m positive it was placebo effect, the <i>instant</i> I took these pills, I felt the fog lift over me. I physically felt something happened to me. I&#x27;ll never forget it.<p>Really I think I just felt the relief of turning a corner, of taking some kind of action. I&#x27;m a naturally positive person who has childhood experience helping myself out of things, so maybe I was built better to deal with it. In that case, despite my success, I absolutely encourage you to seek medical help. It&#x27;s no big deal. Don&#x27;t sweat it. Just take a small step.<p>Life is short and it is amazing. Not &quot;iPhone amazing&quot; - but truly, absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a gift and we have a responsibility to put good things back into the world in return. You never know what good things are around the corner - but even more importantly, you can ACT to influence your life and what happens in it. Don&#x27;t stress about any one thing, and make sure you are treating others well (by taking care of yourself).<p>Take care of yourself. You deserve to feel better.",1403103365

Zero weight for spammy links is gamed by spammers by spamming everything at full blast. There was no downside for them. There are better dials and switches than falling back to a known broken model.<p>With penalties in place spammers need to get those existing bad links removed for their own sites / or build from scratch new sites with clean link profiles (which they are doing anyway, slash and burn). Now they will need to multiply their efforts to negatively target sites above them (not just rank one site, but unrank several sites). Good luck doing that without leaving a detectable fingerprint/trace.<p>The history of when links are created - that will leave a clear beacon that a site has been targeted. Unless a spammer does it very slowly over the course of years. In which case, LOL.<p>Don&#x27;t you think it would be noticeable that a site ranking well, with a clean back link profile suddenly starts attracting heaps and heaps of bad spammy links? That&#x27;s a clear indication something is going on.<p>The better time to use negative SEO is when the spammer has already gotten ahead of his competitor. Then the influx of bad links might look like an effort to regain rankings. That would be more interesting.",1403103019

A given fact will be seen as part of a huge trend by one person, an outlier by another, and a lie by someone else. This explains why there are some facts that are just ignored by people even though they&#x27;re a big deal. For example, Ronald Reagan supported Apartheid in South Africa. People don&#x27;t know how to fit this into a larger framework or pattern so it doesn&#x27;t become part of the social construction of this person.<p>I think this explains why the NSA revelations are such a non-issue to so many people: it doesn&#x27;t fit into their narrative, so it must somehow be overstated or misleading in its presentation. I think a solution to this is to try to notice your aversion or second-guessing of straightforward information. If you immediately start seeking to minimize something or think &quot;This must be wrong&quot;, then that thing is worth deeper investigation.

I feel like if you have a job that is critical to your business process, the job should be persisted to your database and created within the same database transaction as whatever is kicking off the job.<p>Consider how background jobs are typically managed with RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.  They are usually created in an &quot;after commit&quot; hook from whatever gets persisted to your relational database.  In this scenario, there is a gap between the database transaction being committed and the job being sent to and persisted by RabbitMQ or Redis; during this gap the only record of that task is being held in a process&#x27;s memory.<p>If this process gets killed suddenly during this gap, that background job will be lost forever.  It sounds unlikely, but if RabbitMQ or Redis is down and the process has to sit and retry, waiting for them to come back online, the gap can be sizable.",1403102203

Not to be mean, but they are clearly woefully misinformed. I&#x27;ll try to add some data for those not in the field.<p>I was just watching a youtube clip on a B-52 upgrade. A plane we plan to fly into 2040 or so, which is an 80 year life cycle. I started cackling while watching this &#x27;modernization&#x27; as I watched a crew member pull a black rectangle out of the avionics. My gf asked me what was so funny. How to explain.<p>This was a DTM. I have done a lot of work with them. They are more commonly called a &#x27;brick&#x27;. It&#x27;s a tiny amount of flash memory used to move data on and off the airframe. Cost many thousands of dollars, slow, old technology - well, I&#x27;ll let google tell you, I don&#x27;t yack about military capabilities (<a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=a1ff338808a3609c0ccb459600ed3346&tab=core&_cview=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=a1ff338...</a>). But old, obsolete, and so expensive we kept them locked up in our SIL, with sign out procedures to actually get the chance to put your hands on one.<p>Replace that puppy with a USB stick! Pivot! Be agile!<p>Ya. Okay, so this is a device to move data around, and yes, one of the last things I was working on was a USB version of these. Oh, it was still the &#x27;brick&#x27;, but with some ports added. I also worked on previous versions that had a slot for PCMCIA cards. This is still the state of the art version, so far as I know.<p>Why so slow to update? Well, there is the one vendor problem, to start. The military is trying to move to open, but it is slow, and we have untold systems that are not open. It&#x27;s sole source, and the lead time for orders are, interesting.<p>Screw that noise, I&#x27;m putting in a USB port. Sure you are. Equipment on a 1960&#x27;s airframe should handle that, no problem. Okay, so we have a major development effort ahead of us, but it is not insurmountable. How many billions do you want to spend? Because it makes no sense to do this for a B-52, and not other airframes. So it needs to be robust, radiation hardened, capable of operating in dust storms at 150F, in Siberia during blizzards. It needs a self destruct capability so the crew can destroy it if they need to abandon their equipment. And so on. We aren&#x27;t exactly talking 2 week sprints here.<p>Okay, we built it. Bolt that puppy on! No. Have you ever gone through the logistics of a retrofit? I have. So, a few of the things to consider. You have to ground each individual airframe - make time for the installation and tests. That means taking it out of service. What do you do with the crew in the meantime? Someone has to install it, someone has to test it. You need to give them training, and then test them to make sure they know their job. which means earlier some defense contractor had to author that training material, and someone else had to make sure that that material is correct. Then we have supply chain issues. Okay, so how many of these do you want me to build? At what price? Oh, ha, ha, add two zeros. Okay, for that price I will make a single line in a factory. Some of this is classified, so we are building a secure facility. Better add another zero to that price. It&#x27;s built, let&#x27;s start the run! Hmm, need workers, need to get them clearances, need to train them, need to do all the paperwork required by the government to prove you are handling classified materials correctly, prove that you aren&#x27;t ripping them off (I honestly think we spend more money proving we aren&#x27;t ripping the Government off than we save by avoiding the rip offs, but I digress). Okay, line is running. You only needed 1,000 units, you aren&#x27;t paying to have these workers sit idle, so they are invited to pursue a career elsewhere. My line is mothballed. Oh, got a new order? I can maybe rehire and retrain and be ready in 6-12 months.<p>Okay, so we have our units. Who is going to maintain them, repair them, test them, store them. How do they get shipped to a war location? Who is going to track them?<p>Oh, forgot we actually have to get data on and off them. You aren&#x27;t allowed to just stick a USB stick in a military computer (I hope the security reasons are clear). JMPS, the station the air crew uses to write and read data to these things, needs to be upgraded. This is a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; unit - they serve many different aircraft, so there are multiple data formats, multiple requirements. Which airframe do you want me to upgrade first? (insert massive politics here which don&#x27;t necessarily bear much resemblance to the rest of the logistics). How fast and cheap do you want it? I can honestly give it to you fast and cheap - by using the same, obsolete protocols and formats from 40 years ago, tying you in deeper to that obsolete technology. But, I can do it faster, testing is easier. Oh, you want a new protocol? Hmm, wonder how many systems <i>that</i> is going to affect? Anyway, decision made, we hire some programmers, get them cleared, get that process going. Somewhere down the line we have to actually test this stuff, so at some point some aircraft will be idling on the runway while us software squirrels swarm around it, running out tests. Opps, some bugs. Can we keep this an extra two weeks? You have a war to fight? Maybe we can get some time in 2016? Awesome!<p>Software is written and tested, we have a 10 year installation plan, let&#x27;s go! This is so friggin&#x27; agile! I mean, sure, USBs will be obsolete by the time it is fully deployed, but hey ho, we are current to the century!<p>Not so fast, young and foolish one. Time to rotate the air crew through training. They only have to understand 100 different systems, adding one more ain&#x27;t no thing. They have to know the old system, and the new one, because it is not being rolled out all at once, and then there is the massive infrastructure for all the other airframes still using the old system. We have to interoperate. So, train air crew, either train the soldiers and marines who will be supporting this in various war zones, or wait for them to be rotated out and rotate in ones that have been trained in the states. Impose a whole friggin&#x27; logistics infrastructure over that to deal with having two incompatible systems fielded. Hire up IT folk willing to travel to IRAQ to install all the support hardware. It goes on...<p>I&#x27;m thinking, what, 3 sprints? Ya,right ;). Waterfall will become your best friend, and for a good reason, not obstinance and thick-headedness.<p>Anyway, this is a small view into how development and &#x27;waste&#x27; goes on in the defense world. I put waste in quotes because a lot of this is unavoidable. At least, I&#x27;ve wracked my brain, and I don&#x27;t see any easy, obvious way to stream line a lot of stuff. I was brief; the above implies a huge amount of logistics, and anything misplanned, any setback, has a ripple effect.<p>All of that has its frustrations, but it is also very challenging. It&#x27;s a huge optimization problem. Sure, you are one piece, but your piece is inevitably trying to optimize for a very difficult environment (budget, schedule, capabilities, environmentals, you name it).<p>We can iterate, pivot, and throw away web apps. There was an article on Ars on how the old Android sw doesn&#x27;t work because google is shutting down the servers for the obsolete capabilities. It doesn&#x27;t, and cannot work that way in the military.<p>I don&#x27;t mean any of this as a rant. I think it is a really fascinating world, and not many here have experience with it, unless they served (I didn&#x27;t) or worked for a defense contractor. I do urge you all to rethink making easy potshots at government programs. I have my thoughts about the F-35, and other programs, but hey, until you&#x27;ve tried to run even a tiny program you really aren&#x27;t in the position to make an informed judgement. I certainly don&#x27;t feel competent to say &quot;you did it wrong&quot; to F-35 except perhaps in the most sweeping, broad things. That DTM-PCMCIA-USB thing? Real story, and a reflection of the tradeoffs of having different hardware in different systems vs one-size-fits-all. You make 10 disparate systems, well, you are just duplicating effort and wasting tax payer dollars. Try to make one system to do 10 things? Whoa, buckaroo, specialization is the way to go. Solve one problem, cheaply. Okay, I am going to use COTS (commercial off the shelf). I don&#x27;t think so. It is not secure, hardened, etc. Okay, I&#x27;ll pay someone to make a system. Oh, tack on 3 zeros to make the IP owned by the government? Yell at me for that. Okay, we will accept a proprietary format. Don&#x27;t forget to yell at me in 5 years when the company goes bankrupt, gets acquired, or whatever. I should of foresaw that, right? Oh, we&#x27;ll be agile when that time comes and just swap in a new system. How long could that take? (I refer to to the top of the post for that). When we have all that yelling done, don&#x27;t forget to yell at me for not having the insight of going with secure wireless that the military just invented... Oh, you want a modernization program to replace the USB? Okay, how big is that checkbook? And don&#x27;t forget to schedule some yelling time when the wireless gets jammed in the next war.",1403101823

7910270,comment,7909908,7909908,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Speaking directly to OP.<p>A. Culture shock. I&#x27;m guessing that English isn&#x27;t your first language. You&#x27;re in London, an expensive and hard city. <i>It&#x27;s normal.</i> (Hell, I had culture shock moving to New York City when I grew up in Pennsylvania, 3 hours away. I&#x27;d been there before and I still got it.) Some of my friends, who&#x27;ve moved from China or India to NYC or SF, got it a lot worse. It&#x27;s <i>really fucking difficult</i> but it does get better. Yes, there&#x27;ll be lonely nights and financial hardships, but the rewards are real as well.<p>B. Judgment of character. I&#x27;m guessing that this relationship (with the girl who dumped you) was one that meant more to you than to hear. That&#x27;s normal, too, when you&#x27;re starting out. I was an awful judge of character in my early 20s: bad relationships and even worse startups. It does get better. You learn the warning signs through trial and error (mostly error) and, one day, you&#x27;re suddenly badass.<p>C. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re around 22-25. That&#x27;s way too early to be thinking about having kids if you&#x27;re living in a major city. I have friends who are MD-level at banks and hedge funds and started in their late 30s or early 40s. That&#x27;s too late if you ask me, but it&#x27;s what the game demands. Get your career in order first. You&#x27;re not ready for kids.<p>D. Get yourself into therapy. No excuses. There&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of. The culture shock alone (which is difficult for completely normal people) is something you can use help with. It&#x27;s really useful to have one person in your life who you see consistently, but that you have no other emotional relationship with. (Therapy isn&#x27;t &quot;paying someone to be your friend&quot;. It&#x27;s paying someone who knows mental health issues and not part of your personal life to spend <i>consistent</i> time with you.) And if you have a biological illness then it&#x27;s not your fault, and not something to be ashamed of, but you need to take responsibility for it. (The good news is that, for most people, treatment works.)<p>E. I&#x27;m bipolar, probably 85-90% remitted compared to my worst (ages 19-26). When I used to have suicidal thoughts, I looked at the people who wronged me and thought, &quot;are these mediocre assclowns really worth <i>my</i> death?&quot; The answer was always a resounding &quot;no&quot;. So should yours be. Yes, I&#x27;m sure that some people have treated you badly. If you take enough risks (and if you&#x27;re not taking risks, you&#x27;re doing it wrong) you will encounter people who will harm you, often for no reason at all. They aren&#x27;t worth your death. They aren&#x27;t even worth you being unhappy. Just say &quot;fuck him&quot; and get on with your life.",1403101717

Constructors should never call virtual functions or attempt to raise non-fatal failures. If your object requires non-trivial initialization, consider using a factory function or Init() method<p><i>consider using</i> is a far cry from *required to use.  It also explicitly spelled out the situations in which you should consider using something like a factory method.<p>- When you need to call virtual methods since a factory method implies the full construction of the object<p>- When you want to indicate non-fatal failures since a factory method implies being able to do so without exceptions.<p>If your code doesn&#x27;t require virtual methods and doesn&#x27;t need to indicate non-fatal failures, then there is nothing in that particular guideline that&#x27;s relevant to you.<p>It&#x27;s a sensible guideline, especially in an environment where you need to be able to avoid using exceptions.<p>He also took issue with the following:<p>> Provide a copy constructor and assignment operator only when necessary. Otherwise, disable them with DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN.<p>The entire point of this guideline is to disallow the compiler from doing anymore magic than is completely necessary.  Especially surrounding things like construction and operator overloading, C++ does a lot of &#x27;magic&#x27; to keep the user syntax relatively clean, but it can also make the code misleading/hard to understand.<p>The point is that both guidelines are actually sensible, and nothing in them explicitly prevents you from doing anything the author complained about.

There are always 10 other signs there. There is one very overworked official who checks the signs to make sure they aren&#x27;t overtly bad for people looking at them.<p>You notice that two of the signs competing with your client blatantly say that they sell widgets, that their widgets cure cancer, and that other cancer treatments are shams. You know that this sign will mislead or annoy people at the very least, and also that the officials who decide what signs stay up would probably removed it if they look closer.<p>It just so happens that you know that the overworked official will look closer at signs if you put a red flag on them. Putting a red flag on a &quot;good&quot; sign will make the official look closer but not do anything about it. But if the official notices the &quot;bad&quot; signs in question, he will probably take them down.<p>You do it self servingly, of course, but if the signs weren&#x27;t on the &quot;bad&quot; side in the first place, then the official wouldn&#x27;t take it down. It&#x27;s arguable that its not immoral to flag those signs - the flag just tells the overworked official algorithm to look closer and a little more stringently.<p>---<p>To be clear: I don&#x27;t do negative SEO or anything not 100% white hat in the little SEO work I do.

7910147,comment,7909908,7909908,58,0,gobots,,,"I had struggled with untreated suicidal depression for 15 years. I was very quiet about it. I am a web developer.<p>Three years ago I was divorced from my wife, left my birth religion and quit my job. On top of all my issues I was suffering from burnout – I hadn&#x27;t had a vacation in years. Since I was the religious guy at my job I worked the holidays and was promised make up time. Company policy shifted at some point and we were only allowed to accrue a certain number of days with no rollover – when I quit, I also lost 35+ &quot;make up&quot; vacation days.<p>I tried getting another job right away, but quit after a month – it was an easy job, but I had lost my ability to work around others. I managed to pick up steady contract work for about a year, but this didn&#x27;t give me much of a breather.<p>I also found a girlfriend who kept me distracted from my problems, but that wasn&#x27;t to last.<p>Winter is when my depression hits hard, and it kicked in during the second year I was dating this girl. Having zero experience with depressed people, she couldn&#x27;t handle it and dumped me. That&#x27;s when everything I had gone through prior caught up to me.\nLong story short – I got on medication and started therapy which helped a bit, but the suicidal thoughts and planning continued.<p>I don&#x27;t remember exact time lines, but I think it was around 8 months ago that I decided to weigh the pros and cons of living by making a list. I decided not to off myself yet, and that instead I would try to focus on improving myself.<p>I am a homeschooled community college drop out. I grew up in a trailer and taught myself how to program when I was a child by making video games. I&#x27;m also a very creative person who writes, draws, composes music, etc. I started thinking about these things after making the suicide list, and realized that I had lost my way. I&#x27;ve never been one to care about money, but around a decade ago I was on welfare and living in the middle of nowhere. I managed to pull myself out of poverty by learning PHP and getting a job in Chicago. That was my salvation but also nearly my ruination. I had lost my creativity and life was all about work – I was making $96,000 a year at my full time job, plus keeping clients on the side.<p>In the last year I have been able to land another six figure job and multiple contracts with pretty big clients, but everything has consistently fallen through. I collapse a few months in, get panic attacks and feel suicidal again... so I had to take a different approach.<p>My current situation is this – I take on 3 to 6 month short term contracts, live on a shoestring budget (no cellphone, no car payment, nothing but the bare essentials), and then I self educate and work on personal projects for 3 to 4 months solid.<p>By doing this I have been able to learn 4 different game engines, 2 programming languages and finger pick on the guitar. Being raised as a homeschooled Jehovah&#x27;s Witness left me with knowledge gaps, so I have also spent large amounts of time educating myself about science (genetics, biology, cosmology) and religion (I&#x27;ve read most of Dawkins, Hitchens and Sagan).<p>My goals have completely shifted over the last several months. For the first time in a very very long time I&#x27;m not thinking about suicide on a daily / weekly basis. I have put all of my creative energy into creating video games, and though I may never make a hit game or be a great musician or a scientist, these things are giving me exponentially more pleasure than working a full time job, spending 8 to 10 hours a day with people I don&#x27;t love, playing office politics, supporting a platform I don&#x27;t care about and just waiting for the weekend so I can sleep.",1403100462

But <i>it could have</i>.<p>Please remember that at this time, we don&#x27;t claim Docker out-of-the-box is suitable for containing untrusted programs with root privileges. So if you&#x27;re thinking &quot;pfew, good thing we upgraded to 1.0 or we were toast&quot;, you need to change your underlying configuration now. Add apparmor or selinux containment, map trust groups to separate machines, or ideally don&#x27;t grant root access to the application.<p>Docker will soon support user namespaces, which is a great additional security layer but also not a silver bullet!<p>When we feel comfortable saying that Docker out-of-the-box can safely contain untrusted uid0 programs, we will say so clearly.",1403100115

(Which are incredibly specific, due to free speech issues.)<p>Why should slander and libel be illegal at all - why can&#x27;t anyone say, claim, or publish anything they want whatsoever?<p>If you reflect on that the reason is fairly obvious.<p>Likewise, if negative SEO were illegal, it might have the same benefits.<p>Of course technically the standard would be much different from slander/libel, but the fundamental reason that we would limit free speech in this way is clear.  It is just more damaging to the person being damaged than the limit on the free speech that it imposes costs us.  (Which is taken seriously in the United States).<p>So, for this reason, there is a good argument to be made for specific, nuanced, laws against negative SEO in the form of civil penalties.  I would support such a law.",1403100067

I now run a small studio in Wales and day-to-day it is tough, I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts also and it is not easy. The only advice I can give is hold tight, it is very hard finding decent people (few and far between). Don&#x27;t forget to enjoy the things you do for yourself, and slowly continue to hack away at things you want to change in your life - if I have learnt anything as of late, it is that things take time.

7910109,comment,7909421,7909547,1,0,Jach,,,"I wonder if Elohim would accept increasing one&#x27;s tithe a bit as sufficient repentance. While I dropped Mormonism after I left childhood, I still find little thought patterns in myself like wanting to give by default that I think are most simply explained by my upbringing in a smallish (~13,000 to ~26,000 over my first 10 years) city in Utah and around a close-by and religiously-involved extended family, plus cub/boy scouts.<p>When I see bums nowadays I think I should always give to them, but two beliefs have saved me from letting guilt get to me since about 99% or more of the time I don&#x27;t give. (Especially if I&#x27;m in a bum-heavy area like Vancouver or Seattle or if I can quickly rationalize it away by the fact I don&#x27;t usually carry cash or finding a place to buy a banana or whatever would be out of my planned way.) First is my relative lack of spare money since I&#x27;ve only recently finished college and don&#x27;t have a nest egg (I do believe in paying myself first), second is my belief in optimizing charity (see the GiveWell comment). Every time I see a bum and don&#x27;t give, I try to make a small mental note to donate an additional $5-$10 to my chosen non-profit at some point in the future. I&#x27;ve got a few hundred dollar backlog right now due to financial constraints (fortunately I don&#x27;t see too many bums in my area), but this has worked out in the past. Sometimes I do give anyway, and I do feel good, and it&#x27;s not just the feeling of guilt relief. Though I feel a lot better helping people who are trying to help themselves, I do judge, and I feel best helping friends and some family especially when they don&#x27;t ask. In the end I&#x27;m glad when I can live with my decisions and am able to &quot;repent&quot; mistakes not for fear of perishing forever but because they were mistakes that I eventually recognized as such.",1403100040

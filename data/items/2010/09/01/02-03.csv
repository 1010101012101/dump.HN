That is, while they might indeed have the potential to make a big impact, they also involve a lot of detailed technical work and focus in computer science. I think part of that is that I'm simply exposed to systems far more than most other fields, so it's interesting to see the kind of stuff other people come up with. I would never think of Twitter, for example.",1283309953

In fact, I bet you could differentiate services for different amounts: Evernote integration is probably not worth nearly as much as Salesforce integration.<p>You could also consider buffet-style pricing, where you get X services for N dollars, X+Y services for N+M dollars, etc.  As you get more services, that may enable you to keep the value/data ration reasonable.  It doesn't make sense with 12 services available; with 144 services, it might.  I know I don't want to pay extra because you support 130 services I'll never use.",1283306887

I'd say 'make use of' to suggest a thin layer of indirection not implied with the word 'use.'",1283306834

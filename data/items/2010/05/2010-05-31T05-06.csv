They're still making plenty of money, but he wants them to be chasing the tech press a little more.  It's pretty obvious to me: Microsoft isn't in the innovation business just like IBM and GE. They make money hand over fist, but they don't focus on the latest fad of social media or micro-blogging or mobile devices.  If those any of those businesses show long term growth and profitability, one of the established leaders will acquire them and I would imagine Microsoft is constantly looking at such businesses for acquisition.<p>On a side note, I think he's reading into leadership departures in ways that suggest that he has more information regarding them, but he never shows it.

We were taught what was a subset of what was in the books, designed to help mediocre students pass. Learning extra was not encouraged. How the knowledge came about, or is used practically, is glossed over. Half of my classes were Computer Science, but what I remember is mostly from non-CS courses. And on top of it, a lot of teachers gave me pointless exercises and confusing tests and some had grading that wasn't at all straightforward.

a) send a blogger a pitch along w/ a license code.  Also send us a video and some pre-made quotes.  Your story needs to be easy to write (and ideally an actual story, but we'll take what we can get.)
There are some items for which sending a license code does not make sense - for instance, enterprise software, security software, basically things we couldn't really use or evaluate. (""Another day, still no viruses, UI looks good. 5 stars."")  If you think we can successfully use your product, send a license code, but err on the side of caution.  A screencast might really can be very helpful for some personal productivity products, especially if it's something built to handle complexity.<p>b) give him/her some set small number of license codes to give away (5 or 10 if you're looking at something w/ a higher price point, more for something lower.)  Free trials are really better here than license codes - something that turns off in a month would be just fine.<p>c) give him/her a discount code that they can send to their audience/followers and their followers/audience will get 20% off.  This is actually a great alternative to giving people free licenses to give away, and in my experience works pretty well.  And, of course, it will give you a much better idea of how your media outreach is working so you know who you should take out to dinner.",1275284447

1391882,comment,1391208,1391368,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Well, I agree with his first part; and here is why.<p>I've employed a goodly few programmers - invariably the least good are CS majors, the best are usually engineers or physicists.<p>The reason is that CS is a theoretical degree, and far too many people do it assuming they will become a ""programmer of value"", rather than a potentially important CS researcher. I've had applicants bore be with details of compiler theory they learned, or algorithm programming they worked on and so forth. All interesting stuff I admit - but the question of ""can you write a program"" is skipped around :)<p>Compare that with a degree like engineering (any engineering really). They have learned one skill, that is driven home over and over: how to <i>solve problems</i>. The actual knowledge from their degree is irrelevant (you don't generally learn all that much at university) it is their analytical and solution skills that are key.<p><i>There is nothing wrong with this setup</i>. The problem is that CS is treated like an Engineering degree rather than a Mathematics major. Really it should be the latter; if you wish to do research in CS, teach it, work in sort of related fields (CS Majors make good traders, for example, like mathematicians) then CS is the way forward. If you want to be an industry programmer it isn't.<p>What we need is an intermediary; an Engineering degree that hands you some basics of CS and a whole lot of critical thinking. The whole aim of a degree like that is to point you in the right direction and let your interests develop into a career. This needs to replace CS as the majors for most people - and I think, actually, it would make them happy :)<p>Hackers are an odd exception; personally I think a good hacker would get much from any of the degrees - theoretical or not - though it is worth remembering that a good hacker will generally be a good programmer anyway because they can hack around, and solve, problems.<p>(Just to point out: I disagree with all of what Zed has to say about CS itself - clearly there is a lot to learn there, if you go for the right reasons)<p>University is a great choice for someone to further their education; not because it will teach you much (if you expect university to be the peak, or even the start, of your education you've failed already :P). But because it teaches you the ability to learn for yourself, think critically, break the discipline cycle that school drilled into you, get drunk, make important friends, find people to bounce ideas off.. the list goes on. Somewhere down the bottom is ""sit in lectures and learn stuff"". Learning is easy; the rest is far more important! :)",1275284187

And, if you read <i>The Ethics of Belief</i>, you will find that my view is completely at odds with the position of the church - I do not recognize ""faith"" as a legitimate basis for believing something.<p>I'm not really sure where you are going with a statement like ""Who's to say her ideas are wrong?"". It sounds like moral relativism, but I don't want to assume that is what you intended unless you explicitly say so.  I assume you agree that people can have ideas that are wrong (e.g., 2+2=5, ""the world is flat"", etc.), and that other people are justified in pointing out that those ideas are wrong. If my assumption is correct, then you are either saying that these particular ideas are not wrong, or you are saying they are wrong but that Jenny McCarthy and Oprah should not be held culpable for promoting them. I'll assume the latter.<p>To be clear, I am <i>not</i> saying people should refrain from making any statement unless it is universally agreed upon.  I'm saying that before believing something (and trying to spread that belief to others), we have a duty to investigate our beliefs and subject them scientific scrutiny. Failure to discharge that duty injures society. Given the  lack of scientific evidence of a link between vaccination and autism, one must conclude that Jenny McCarthy (and by extension, Oprah) has either failed to subject her beliefs to such scrutiny, or willfully ignores evidence to the contrary. In my opinion, this does constitute <i>some</i> degree of culpability.",1275283931

Aside from eliminating 6.001 (which is the most talked about change), computer science students now have more freedom to take computer science courses (rather than certain required electrical engineering courses) and vice versa.  For example, in the old curriculum, electrical engineers had to take 6.001 and computer scientists had to take 6.003 (signals and systems).<p>IMHO, the more freedom, the better.  If you are concerned about having a well rounded education in EECS, then you can sit down with your advisor, or talk to your friends, and ultimately decide to take the old curriculum anyway.

Let's put our investor hats on. There are these businesses, Windows and Office. They throw off a certain cash flow. It doesn't last forever.<p>So what to do? First, we re-invest some of that cash flow into extending the life of the cash flow from the profits themselves. Advertising, new versions, and so forth.<p>Second, we can pay a dividend to investors.

1391854,comment,1391208,1391390,0,0,snikolov,,,"I think characterizing the courses that replaced 6.001 as exercises in ""pasting libraries together"" is unfair.  The new introductory courses 6.01 and 6.02, are focused on introducing fundamental EECS design principles, in the context of mobile robotics and digital communication systems, respectively.<p>Having just taken 6.01 and 6.02, I have mixed feelings.  One the one hand, you had to write relatively little code within some larger skeleton that had been written for you.  But the code you had to write emphasized important engineering design principles without making you write an entire mobile robotics system from scratch (which is not the point of the class).<p>On the other hand, the problems were somewhat contrived, and didn't allow much room for creativity.  There was only really one way to fill in the blank code.  This required understanding the structure of the rest of the code to figure out exactly the way in which the professors might want you to write the missing code.  The intention seems to be that this is a valuable skill, but for me it was at the cost of stifling any creativity.<p>Time and again, I would be partnered with someone (we had randomized partners for 6.01) and I would say ""this is interesting, maybe we can solve it like this"" (and I would start proposing some ideas), and my partners would say something like ""I don't think that's how <i>they want us to do it</i>.""

I don't really get it, as the 12 core AMD systems are extremely impressive, for loads that thread well enough to use that many cores.<p>In recent memory, it seems that Intel has been following AMD technologically, albeit at higher clock speeds.  First, they copied the amd64 instruction set, and then they copied the hyper transport architecture.   Right now, it looks like Intel occupies the high end of the market, but as far as I can tell, their lead is based as much on superior sales ability than on any technological lead.<p>For loads that thread well, they beat the intel chips both in work done per watt consumed, and they absolutely destroy intel chips on cost to acquire, so I'm not sure why people seem to think that AMD is down for the count.",1275283083

It's something you can largely ignore during a degree, where it is unlikely that a project lasts more than a few months.  The best way to learn what challenges you'll face in the real world is to take on a long-term project.  You'll make assumptions and mistakes early on which you can learn a lot from.<p>It would also be great to observe or join an existing project -- a project that has been around for some time but still maintains a strong momentum -- and learn from the way it works.  That is, short cut some of the process by observing others that have overcome some of the challenges.<p>This should also teach you that there is so much still to learn about successful software projects that you'll be doing it your whole career :).",1275282703

Indeed this is part of a different major (Civil Engineering, I suppose).<p>In contrast, Computer Science is a very broad discipline. Large portions of it are science; large portions are engineering (or similar to engineering, if we exclude Computer Engineering per se). A good student, or a student with a good mentor, should be able to choose a more theoretical (scientific) or more practical (engineering) path and work on the curriculum accordingly. I understand that it is not always possible (in some places, for example, students cannot choose classes), but at least a student should be able to choose where to focus.<p>A small point about ""picking languages on their own"". I think basics of languages can be taught to freshmen, at least selectively, to help those students who may be lacking in previous exposure to computers in high school. (Depending on the university, this may or may not be an issue.)

There is a 'chicken and the egg' scenario in online advertising where you can't sell ads if you don't have enough 'inventory' (aka ad impressions) and you can't pay for marketing to bring more viewers/content without $$$ from ads.<p>So what happens is Hulu goes out and sells a few advertisers  $100,000 in pre-roll ads. The advertiser is used to paying $15 per pre-roll so the Hulu sales people build some crazy equation based off of those two variables (sometimes they'll add in things like 'value adds' which are basically custom stuff that the ad agencies refuse to pay for) and come up with an impression goal.<p>You read that right, the # of impressions per campaign is solely based on the price of the unit and the amount of the ad buy. It's left to the Adops division to see if they can actually FILL that order.<p>Generally, you'll find that companies like Hulu oversell their inventory between 25-50%.

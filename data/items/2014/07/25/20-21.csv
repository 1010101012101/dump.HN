It doesn&#x27;t have to slow a company down at all, and it&#x27;s definitely a function that can enhance a company culture in really positive ways without dampening it.<p>However, if you think sexual harassment doesn&#x27;t happen in small startups, you&#x27;re not paying attention. At the end of the day, HR is a mediator for the company to protect it from lawsuits. HR can stop a little issue from turning into a big, expensive issue, which is positive for both the company and employees.",1406321936

Later, Carol buys a share from Dave for $50. This new trade implicitly values the company at $50,000.<p>The value of the company fluctuated by $50,000, but if you look at every trade, an equal number of dollars and shares were exchanged on each side. Alice lost $100 of money while Bob gained $100 of money.

Even though you provided one quote to counter his one &quot;selective&quot; quote. I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with what you state in that context, I simply disagree with the selective quoting label.<p>I was trying to point out that the majority opinion was not really relevant to the point because it was not decided on morality, but on not following the law. Therefore, a quote from the dissenting judge that was relevant to the topic at hand, i.e. whether it is moral or not to reduce one&#x27;s tax liabilities, was fair. Using the majority opinion to counter the poster&#x27;s point is not fair because the opinion is not relevant to the point.<p>I shall attempt to provide an example. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a court case about the legalities of puppy mills. The majority opinion is that they are illegal. In the dissent there&#x27;s a statement concerning the desire for a certain breed and that&#x27;s why the defendants ran a puppy mill. I quote the dissenting judge about people&#x27;s desire of that certain breed, not mentioning puppy mills. You state my use of the quote is not valid because the majority decided that puppy mills are illegal. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.<p>Finally, I know that the law should have nothing to do with morals. Morals are subjective and attempts to legislate morals almost always results in unintended consequences. I simply disagree with judging a company by moral standards based on their actions under the law.

8087401,comment,8086549,8087108,3,0,king_jester,,,"> Think about the open source software movement (OSS). One crucial perspective that the OSS shares with D&I is that both view discrimination as an impediment to progress. OSS licenses include several non-discrimination clauses (economic, field of endeavor, other restrictions). The licenses go to great lengths to ensure the technology is available to everyone.<p>While licenses may have clauses that deal with some kinds of discrimination, OSS communities are not inclusive and may actually be outright hostile to groups of people. The last Model View Culture had an article about this [1]. Suffice it to say that there is no common community behavior that appears in all OSS groups and what is exceptable in one group vs. another varies quite a bit.<p>> Or is it the open air bazaar, with all kinds of people talking (softly or loudly) in a place known for public discourse. A place where anyone can walk by and join in and become part of what&#x27;s going on?<p>Well this come back to the very common myth of meritocracy in tech, that tech only looks at merit and thus avoids discrimination, personal and institutional. However, meritocracy in tech often simply functions as a way for people to avoid talking about bias or pretending like bias doesn&#x27;t exist. Moreover, what it means to look for merit is often defined as those statuses and symbols that are comfortable to the dominant group of people in tech, white men of middle or higher class backgrounds.<p>> So this isn&#x27;t really about embracing D&I. Instead, the tech community needs to start living up to its own rhetoric--it&#x27;s own values. This isn&#x27;t about adopting an external issue, it&#x27;s about a community fully aligning with its own values.<p>Again, there is no consensus on values and often people actively advocate that there should be little criticism or reflection on what people and groups in tech value. Without that kind of introspection and discussion, little will change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/leaving-toxic-open-source-communities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/leaving-toxic-open-source...</a>",1406319341

This active discrimination is an ongoing and constant problem that goes all the way back to apartheid.

Not sure if that's true today, or in certain categories (graphics cards?).<p>But, credit where credit is due: Around 2005-6, I chose to run OpenBSD on my desktop computer at home because its support for wireless network interfaces was far and above better than Linux or any other open source OS. At that time, getting on my home network with Linux was a complete no-go, while OpenBSD worked flawlessly out of the box.<p>At that time there were several OpenBSD devs doing the hard, ugly work of reverse-engineering the crappy binary blobs that were accepted in mainstream Linux distros (and FreeBSD), and instead turning out reliable, open-source drivers.<p>Today I find Linux more practical to run on my laptop, but I really hope OpenBSD never goes anywhere. We need different approaches like theirs. (Actually, the non-availability of Flash was a big reason I switched back to Linux, and that's becoming less of an issue with HTML5...)",1353185703

""<p>I, and several of my colleagues, have been running dozens of OpenBSD systems for about 10+ years.  In particularly, OpenBSD had an elegant IPv6 Firewall/failover mechanism about 5 years before Cisco finally decided to port Active/Failover to their ASA platform - so we were forced through sheer necessity to deploy OpenBSD in what was otherwise an all Cisco shop.  Further to that, OpenBSD's  ability to track several hundred thousand shortlived UDP sessions state fully on inexpensive x86 systems saved us several 10s of thousands of dollars over the equivalent Cisco systems.<p>At one point, all of HPs internal infrastructure was transitioned off of the Cisco ASA onto OpenBSD firewalls - OpenBSD is reliable, and industrial.<p>Needless to say, I'm a fan of OpenBSD and consider it critical to the various infrastructures that we deploy.<p>I've never been tempted (nor, to my knowledge, have my colleagues) to even consider installing X-Windows on an OpenBSD system.

For the most part, the pages are created on public sites because the links are spammed on social networks, and those networks quickly block postings with the same links over and over again.  So, if you can create hundreds of different URLs with the same landing page, you can have hundreds of times the spam posts go through and not be blocked.  Most of these guys don't bother with private domains because social networks will quickly issue a blanket block to all posts containing links to untrusted domains that have been reported to them for spam, but they will never issue a blanket block for a site like Github or Facebook.  So the links last longer.<p>As to the specifics:<p>1) <i>1. hide the referrer from their affiliate program (to prevent getting banned for spamming)</i>.

That gives you a rough idea of the typical markup in that neighborhood. I've known street vendors in thailand to give 90% off.<p>But the thing is that these people need the high margin sales to make a living. They'll sell at the lowest price that they're still making money, but if all of their sales are like that they're not making a living. That's why you shouldn't haggle all the way down if you like the vendor.",1353183590

You certainly would not be able to sublicense those rights further, except to those you had already. This is not the same as Novus's ability to ""stop licensing the software to new parties"", it means you would not be able to give others the rights you had gotten through estoppel.""--I agree 100%. My apologies to other readers if I implied the opposite. I do still think that estoppel would protect licensees themselves insofar as they had relied on the software in, e.g., the development of their businesses.<p>Your point about sub licensing is well taken and deserves further exploration. It would appear that, estoppel or not, those who are now rereleasing the software may be on shaky legal ground. As you said, estoppel would probably not give you the right to sublicense, which is effectively what these folks are doing.<p>""Essential to the creation of apparent authority are words
or conduct of the principal, communicated to a third party,   
that give rise to the appearance and belief 
that the agent possesses authority to enter into a  
transaction""--Agreed. I was under the impression this had transpired in the present case. I'm not sure about New York, but in many jurisdictions a principal's failure to act (given some other criteria) can be enough. I was thinking that would come into play here. Naturally it would depend on the exact facts, of which I am uncertain.<p>I would also raise the question of jurisdiction. Novus may be in New York, but what of licensees in other states? They could potentially make the argument that their states' laws apply, because part of the ""transaction,"" i.e. the downloading and licensing of the software, occurred there. Would this argument succeed? I dunno.",1353183379

If hardware companies had full open source drivers then this would be less of an issue, this is not the rosey situation we have and in many area's we have binary blobs.  Binary blobs targeted at an OS and CPU.<p>Now with the advent of ARM, the sence to have open source drivers becomes more palatable and hopefully sainer.  More options for your hardware to run upon and be sold upon is more sales.  If you open source things and let the community help then they help and you get more win win.  It is the area's were companies want to protect IP they have above and beyond the patent protection.  There are cases if they are using others IP in there product which they pay to use that prevents them from releaseing the source and at best able to do binary blobs.  If we had binary blobs that you could add your own wrapper around and accomodate a OS's needs, then you would still have more platforms than not open to you.<p>But this realy is mostly down to fancy networking cards, graphics cards and anything with a radio in it mostly.

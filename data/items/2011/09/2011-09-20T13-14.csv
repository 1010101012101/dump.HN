New products are shipped in higher quantities to meet retailer demand (ever been in a store that has exactly one new item?). But once the supply pipeline is flowing its much easier to estimate demand and produce enough to meet it.<p>This is something that Apple has been terrible at despite great marketing.<p>But all companies will parade the numbers that show them in the best light. Samsung isn't producing a lot of tablets just to dump them in landfills and retailers aren't stocking more than they can realistically sell in <1 months time. For the retailer it ties up money and floorspace. Apple owns all it's stores and can tell you exactly how many iPhones they have sold, they won't tell you how many Apple TVs they've sold even though they know that number. Samsung might be able to tell you how many tablets sold. But numbers shipped is more palatable to investors and developers. If they were getting a lot of returns (and early android tablets were) they wouldn't exactly parade them out.",1316527199

3017539,comment,3015479,3016247,4,0,Gatsky,,,"Your point is very valid. The Wired article seems to suggest that placebos are genuinely effective. We shouldn't consider the medical researchers studying the placebo effect to be idiots however. Unfortunately, focusing only on hard clinical endpoints is not a luxury medical research has, and would involve excluding most psychiatric research, most palliative care research, quality of life analyses in cancer patients etc etc, in other words, lots of important stuff.<p>So if you still want to try and make people feel better, the placebo effect has to be dealt with.<p>I do agree with you though this being a poor article. Some additional points:<p>1. Placebos can have adverse effects. For example, it is quite common for patients to experience nausea and even vomiting when taking a dummy pill in a clinical trial. So they aren't universal panaceas.<p>2. Sometimes placebos can be the intervention arm, not the control arm:<p><a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61115-4/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67...</a><p>This study compared simply administering air versus oxygen to patients with a terminal illness who were short of breath. Giving air was as effective as oxygen for relieving shortness of breath.
This isn't the placebo effect getting stronger, this is just realising that doing less but doing something works perfectly well.",1316527136
3017538,comment,3016319,3017474,11,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"Being open-source and wanting to control the experience are diametrically opposed ideas.  When you choose to be open-source you are choosing to allow people to hack your code in whatever way they wish. That includes hacking it in a way that some might consider to be a poor experience. The fundamental value proposition of open-source is that some people will use your source poorly, but that on the aggregate good stuff will bubble up. If you don't believe in that, you don't believe in open-source (which is fine).<p>I don't see anything in Andy Rubin's resume that suggests he's an open-source advocate. I'm not aware of any of his previous projects being open-source.  Please call me out if this is incorrect.<p>Android is open-source in this same way id Tech is open-source.

3017536,comment,3015597,3017260,4,0,wisty,,,"Doh, you're right. I really didn't compare apples to apples ther.<p>Still:<p>1967 - 59,236k households, GDP 3.9T ~= 65k / household (2005 dollars).<p>2010 - 117,538k households, GDP 13T ~=  111k / household (2005 dollars).<p>That's something like 1.2% GDP growth per household, while median household income is going up at 0.5%.<p>On one hand, there might be less dependents per household, but on the other hand, there's a lot more women working. Despite all the housewives burning their bras, forgoing large families, putting their kids in childcare and getting a job, household income <i>still</i> hasn't risen.<p>Maybe there's a lot of low-payed single women, dragging the median down. That doesn't convince me that everything is OK though.<p>Let's look at incomes of income-earning over 15s:<p>Between 1960 and 2004, the salaries of white males went up 0.068% a year. White women's salaries grew at 2%, probably because they were working much greater hours. Black men did well, and black women did even better. But overall, it was a 0.74% per year increase. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States#Over_time_-_by_Race_.26_Sex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_S...</a><p>People are better off, but mostly because the women are working longer hours, they don't have kids. Soon, they will also be working more years, as the boomer realize they can't retire. It's a lot better if you're black, but not because of productivity growth trickling down to median workers.<p>I could track down the numbers, to find how many workers over 15 there are (or maybe how many people there are over 15, or between 15 and 65), but I just don't think productivity growth is <1%, like median income growth. If productivity growth is <1%, then we have another problem altogether.<p>OK, here we go, real growth by percentile (1960 to 2007):<p>95th: 1.86% / year.
80th: 1.58% / year.
60th: 1.4% / year.
40th: 1.1% / year.
20th: 1.05% / year.<p><i>Arguably</i> (as pg says), this is a good thing, because risk-takers and innovators are being rewarded, driving growth. But it's not as simple as high inequality = high growth, and that doesn't explain why inequality is growing. pg says it's because corporate structures are becoming more efficient, cutting out deadwood managers. Whatever. If this is the case, why isn't GDP growing at a higher rate than the 60s? Has our society simply reached the point where technology no longer drives growth? That's scarier than greedy executives, compliant governments, self-serving boards of directors looting society; but I don't think it's happened yet.<p>China had huge inequality in the from 1750 to 1950, and stagnent growth, low inequality and moderate growth from 1950 to 1990 (with a few hiccups, notably the Great Leap Forward, and Cultural Revolution, but communism worked a lot better than their previous system of capitalism + corrupt feudalism), then high inequality and high growth from 1990. While inequality might be a requirement for high growth, it's not always a good sign. It can just mean that the rich and powerful are screwing the poor, which makes it harder for a poor innovator to take their idea from rags to riches.",1316527088

I'm open to a lot of ideas and directions that a discussion may take but this is just a non-starter, a laughable example of exactly the sort of benighted, willful ignorance that dooms fruitful discussion. This is the kind of statement you can only make if you <i>haven't read philosophy written before 1859</i>. I mean, of course, _The Origin of Species_ was a watershed to be sure, but there's certain philosophical freight even Darwin can't carry.<p>I think underneath this is a problem of false analogy. Philosophical insight is not the same species as math, and doesn't ""build"" the same way, in a scaffold of proofs and deductive confidence towards an inevitable conclusion that, once reached, can be accepted on its own terms without understanding of the prior movements.<p>I'd suggest reading a bit further and broaden your engagement. As a mathematician, you might appreciate Pierre Duhem's views on religion and history, Whitehead's ideas on the history of science, and in particular I'd say check out Hans Jonas' ""Is God a Mathematician?"".

3017486,comment,3015246,3016723,2,0,fmap,,,"That's a very good point. One way to circumvent this problem is to combine hashing and crit-bit trees,
by constructing an unordered tree on the hash values of the set elements. The nice thing here is that if the
hash function behaves like a uniform random variable the resulting tree will be balanced. Furthermore,
without ordering the implementation is trivial.<p>At the same time you will not need rehashing once the table ""fills up"" and since you use don't discard
bits from the hash function the expected number of collisions after inserting n elements with a 32 bit hash
is n / 2^32 - or 0 for reasonable values of n.<p>Additionally you can use clustering (e.g. build a crit-nibble tree, with 16 pointers per node - one 64 byte cache line)
to reduce the number of cache misses. This can backfire spectacularly unless the data is essentially random,
so the hashing step remains important.<p>It may not be a silver bullet, but there are some interesting trade-offs.",1316526300

All of those could have potential privacy or safety implications. For probably around 99.9% of all people using cell-phones, the exact same reasoning holds for how they think about them, and how they would prefer it to just work well and have more functionality, instead of carrying this (to them) abstract notion of being 'open'. If 'closed' means they get a better product (which is very often the case), then closed is better for them.<p>Also, you are fooling yourself if you honestly believe that 'open' is a guarantee for 'safe', 'secure' or 'thrustworthy'. Open-source software has exploits and security holes just like proprietary software. Maybe less, but let's not pretend 'open' is equivalent to 'safe'. You can never be 100% sure the source code you are looking at is actually exactly the same as what is running on this piece of hardware you bought anyway, even though the manufacturer says so.<p>I kind of agree with what spokengent said. FOSS has many advantages, but RMS is really taking things too far, as he has always done, pretending FOSS <i>only</i> has advantages and no downsides, and proprietary software is <i>always</i> bad and evil. He doesn't seem to understand there are many devices and applications that are simply incompatible with the FOSS way of doing things, for various reasons that have nothing to do with privacy, freedom or security.<p>RMS is a FOSS absolutist, advocating FOSS like it's a religion, not a way of doing things that works really well for many things, but maybe not so well for others.<p>Whether FOSS works well for cell-phones is up for debate, personally I don't really believe in it, and the way the Android ecosystem is developing and the strange sem-open development model behind is, is only confirming this, at least for now.",1316524662

Not because they're logically inconsistent, but because they're based on premises I don't accept. I think a lot of people are the same way; we can recognize an argument that ""if you accept X, then Y"", and say ""OK, but I don't accept X"".<p>In this case I think he's reaching the same conclusion I would, but via a different route (albeit one with some of the same stops along the way).

Some of them are loony; and they are in part the creation of some older, tireder, Republic faction.<p>But I guess they do all share vaguely Republican values, and the belief that both major parties (not just the Democrats) have been taxing too much.<p>My issue is that they are attacking taxing, not spending. It's spending that's the problem, as total revenue (tax) will eventually have to match total spending. And the Republicans can be cynical bastards who spend like crazy, then force the Democrats to raise taxes (later down the track) for fear of the debt becoming unsustainable.<p>But I guess ""Spent Enough Already"" doesn't have the same ring, or historical kitsch.",1316523744

India has a family centric society , where welfare of the family gets priority than  the  welfare of the nation, which is one of the factor for rampant corruption (IMO).<p>2. The infrastructure is poor.<p>3. The divide between rich and poor is high! (income inequality)<p>4. The Public sector is very slow to respond to the growing needs of infrastructure! They have no clue at all!<p>5. There is still caste system in rural India, where they don't respect fellow country men as a human being.<p>6. The politics is only for the rich and heirs of powerful politicians (the parliament is filled with sons and daughters of old politicians read:family business)<p>India has a long way to go!",1316523675

Now trying to squeeze something out there is not a good idea if you're trying to keep your sanity and dignity. So far each and every project seems to be flooded by people from all over the world and the few projects that screamed 'I'm made for you' where closed to private bids _after I quickly finished the project and while I was typing a ""I've got what you need, this is what I did"" bid - or the employer went with a _more expensive_ alternative, probably because I cannot ramp up any ratings there.<p>Now I'm at a loss right now, trying to look into the recently discussed tinyproj (let's see what Saturday brings in terms of opportunities), but it seems that competition online is a disaster.<p>So - do you earn some extra money in the evenings/on weekends?

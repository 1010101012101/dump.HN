But I think that if you knew you might use any key in the space, and you didn&#x27;t insist on a minimal perfect hash, i.e. one where there is a 1:1 mapping from hashes back to keys, that you could write such a function without having all of the keys.<p>If you did this, you&#x27;d also need to prove you were generating a unique and effectively random hash.  If I was a crypto academic, that might be an interesting line of research.

Yet the comic allocates large amounts of space to China&#x27;s relationship with the US and the US trade deficit, neither of which are targets of the TPP.<p>* The comic is many, many pages long and only begins talking about the TPP at the very end. In that discussion of the TPP, there appear to be a total of just two panels actually based on any text from the TPP, despite <i>extraordinary</i> claims made about the breadth of the TPP earlier.<p>* It has an extended segment on US job exports, as if the TPP somehow changes the fact that every job that could be viably exported to Asia already has been. The US does not need the TPP to outsource manufacturing to Asia.<p>* The most important goals the US appears to have in the TPP is to harmonize intellectual property rules across the Pacific Rim. There is a very reasonable, very important argument against making Asian IP law more like the US, which is that medical care across Asia depends on lax IP laws. What does this comic have to say about intellectual property? <i>They&#x27;re coming for our music downloads!!!</i><p>* It has an extended segment about an evil robot that alternately represents either the finance industry or (once again) China and never connects it to the TPP or, for that matter, reality --- it&#x27;s a pure appeal to emotion. &quot;Modern finance is scary; reject the TPP!&quot; The segment isn&#x27;t even internally consistent! This is the <i>lead-off argument</i> the comic poses against TPP, and it boils down to &quot;finance is friendly right now but might not be in the future; China&quot;.<p>* Despite the domain name, no economist seems to have had a hand in its authorship. The author himself is not an economist.<p>Like I said last time this came up: if you&#x27;re looking for coherent opposition to the TPP, there are great economists you can read to get that information.

(OK, KIBO makes do without, but I&#x27;m talking about serious programming here.) In a way, programming is a subclass of writing.

Yes, the need for programming skills in the world around us is big and growing rapidly, but it is probably not as big as we as programmers tend to believe, for two psychological reasons that skew our perspective:<p>If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail - and if you have a programmer&#x27;s mindset, you will tend to approach (almost) all problems as if they were software problems. That&#x27;s just human nature. Mathematicians try to solve problems mathematically, carpenters look for a practical solution, etc. (There&#x27;s a good TED talk on that, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find it right now.)

But it formalizes the insight that quality-control is trying to impart -- the identification of inconsistencies among consistent variation.<p>So let&#x27;s run some simulations in Matlab. We&#x27;ll generate M numbers distributed like Beta and N like a Pareto (a &quot;long tail&quot;, &quot;black swan&quot; distribution) with identical mean and standard deviation, and shuffle them before we interpret them as a time-series. Then we&#x27;ll check Nelson&#x27;s rules. Since we know how many ordinaries there are, we have a target.<p>In 10^4 repeated simulations each with samples of 180 ordinary betas and 20 Paretos, we expect to identify 10% of abnormals. Now, my samples are shuffled, and Nelson rules rely on time-structure (but this is precisely their weak spot); my code [2] also has visible bugs I didn&#x27;t bother to fix because they&#x27;d involve thinking too hard and didn&#x27;t seem so serious in large samples. Still, here are identification rates:<p>- Rule 1: 0.5%. This will be counter-intuitive to students of the normal distribution, but recall that the ordinary observations have a bounded distribution and we&#x27;re really catching only the abnormals. Now, we&#x27;ve missed a lot of the 10% by this rule.<p>- Rule 2: 6.32535%<p>- Rule 3: 3.4421%<p>- Rule 4: 4.484%<p>- Rule 5: 27.83735%. This is the &quot;medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control&quot;.<p>- Rule 6: 8.49465%<p>- Rule 7: 4.38775%<p>- Rule 8: 2.1294%<p>(Edited after some bug fixes that, comfortingly, didn&#x27;t change the results by much!)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_distribution</a>

You don&#x27;t have to use Linux to verify that claim.  There will be some sticking points, though:<p>- Round trips will be problematic.  So if you export to doc and then reimport and then export again you will likely have some difficulty.<p>- Some things won&#x27;t work (like multi-page footnotes) because Word formats them incorrectly.  This will affect pagination, but probably will be fine for most things other than legal documents.<p>- Fonts can be a problem.  If you don&#x27;t install the same fonts you can have font metric problems.  This isn&#x27;t really an issue because it is easy to install the same fonts.  Some Linux distros don&#x27;t make it easy because the fonts are non-free (as in freedom), though.<p>I worked for 5 years teaching English and for 4 or those years I had to interoperate with people using Office (they were forced to use Open Office in the 5th year because the school board decided not to renew their MS licenses).  I was making <i>very</i> complicated documents with precise layout, multi-lingual fonts (Japanese and English), and many pictures.  I very rarely had any problems.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I hate Open Office with a passion (and I&#x27;m glad that as a programmer once again I never have to touch it).  But it&#x27;s not really much different than Word in that respect ;-)<p>Some work flows are just impossible, though.  If you are group editing a document and marking it up as you pass it around a group, then it just won&#x27;t work because there will be too many round trips.  As I said, there will be pagination issues for very complex formatting and so it is not possible to use for legal work (most people who do serious legal work use Word Perfect, though, because Word&#x27;s formatting is broken).<p>As for resumes, I always avoided sending doc files to people for fear that someone would try to edit it.  I always send PDFs.  However, in the few cases where I was not allowed to submit anything other than a doc file (for example my teaching job), I had absolutely no trouble.  YMMV.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, the programmers at Microsoft actually work very hard at keeping things as interoperable as they can (as far as I can tell).  It&#x27;s just that they have a massively huge legacy app and it&#x27;s hard to work with.  The MS QAs even used to send me bug reports when Word Perfect outputted poor doc files.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of MS, but in the course of my career I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of past and present MS programmers/QAs.  I don&#x27;t have a bad word to say about any of them.  In fact, when we did some joint ventures with MS while I was at Corel, the QAs we worked with were some of the best I&#x27;ve ever met.",1438355446

The net effect is censorship through fear.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9869755"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9869755</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</a>",1438355149

It&#x27;s very nice having that level of control if you find it to be worth the time to fiddle with a few sites&#x27; request settings.  I find that I prefer the simplicity in a site loaded without a lot of third party BS (and often not even CSS for sites that use a CDN for it).",1438355146

The secret is that you teach how to program, not how to JavaScript.<p>How to program is entirely different. It involves breaking down problems, creating abstractions for those problems, and turning them into code. And JavaScript is the one language that gets out of your way and lets you create programs that give new learners immediate feedback in a web browser.<p>Python and Ruby are great and all, but this is 2015 and new students are not that interested in black and white terminal applications. JS and HTML make it easy to make things closer to what they experience.<p>People my age learned to program while playing text adventure games.

No one wants to go through algebra; that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s siphoned off to grad students. Do you really think a tenured professor is going to spend time checking the grunt work on /someone else&#x27;s/ paper when they won&#x27;t do it for their own? I&#x27;m intrigued by the possibility of using natural language processing and logical system tools like Wolfram Alpha. Wolfram recently posted on his blog about building machines that could store data about complex mathematical objects, and already you can build machines that confirm first order logical statements.<p>Farming out low-level tasks to automated systems would be interesting. Imagine if the format of papers changed entirely, ie, you had to submit your proofs in certain formats, or at least certain parts in specific ways. I&#x27;m sure that many professors would be elated to see the number of papers they have to review go down drastically; although, I&#x27;m sure many will be disappointed to get a return letter that says, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but the low level flaws were so serious that they were automatically rejected and are not fit for review.&quot;",1418244897

More than once, I have had papers rejected simply because a single reviewer barely read the paper and dismissed it. These kinds of reviews are very frustrating to receive, not only because they failed to understand the basic premises of your paper, but because these reviews contain no useful information on how to make your paper better for future submissions.<p>Of course, the opposite can happen where mediocre works slips through, and the reviewers that allowed that should be held accountable too. Its painful to me that so much of the acceptance process for research papers (in my field at least) is based on luck.<p>Moral of the story: reviewer anonymity is good but it comes at the expensive of accountability.",1418243908

I&#x27;m part of the team at Common Crawl and thought I&#x27;d clarify some points in the article.<p>The most important is that you can download all the data that Common Crawl provides completely for free, without the need to pay S3 transfer fees or process it only in an EC2 cluster. You don&#x27;t even need to have an Amazon account! Our crawl archive blog posts give full details for downloading[1]. The main challenge then is storing it, as the full dataset is really quite large, but a number of universities have pulled down a significant portion onto their local clusters.<p>Also, we&#x27;re performing the crawl once a month now. The monthly crawl archives are between 35-70 terabytes compressed. As such, we&#x27;ve actually crawled and stored over a quarter petabyte compressed, or 1.3 petabytes uncompressed, so far in 2014. (The archives go back to 2008.)<p>Comparing directly against the Internet Archive datasets is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. They store images and other types of binary content as well, whilst Common Crawl aims primarily for HTML, which compresses better. Also, the numbers used for Internet Archive were for all of the crawls they&#x27;ve done, and in our case the numbers were for a single month&#x27;s crawl.<p>We&#x27;re excited to see Martin use one of our crawl archives in his work -- seeing these experiments come to life the best part of working at Common Crawl! I can confirm that optimizations will help you lower that EC2 figure. We can process a fairly intensive MR job over a standard crawl archive in afternoon for about $30. Big data on a small budget is a top priority for us!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.commoncrawl.org/2014/11/october-2014-crawl-archive-available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.commoncrawl.org/2014/11/october-2014-crawl-archi...</a>",1418243117

(Note: as this case wasn&#x27;t an employer/employee relationship, the EEOC doesn&#x27;t apply, but you are making a very broad claim.)<p>For example of confidentially as part of the resolution process in a public organization, see the EEOC&#x27;s own internal resolution guidelines at <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/adr/resolvehandbook.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/adr/resolvehandbook.cfm</a> .<p>You are right that the court decisions are nearly all public.<p>Bu to be clear, you want every investigation of a violation of internal policies to be public?

Or is there something about this case which is special, and if so, what?<p>In the case of EEOC-related topics, your advice seems to be contrary to what&#x27;s regarded as best practices.<p>You also seem to want an entire new level of government rules and oversight. For examples: What&#x27;s the publication system for those decisions? Who can access them, and for how long are they made available to the public? Are they required to be in English? Can anyone start a internal proceeding or is it limited to managers? Or to the CEO? What about customers and students? In the courts, the plaintiff can be anonymous, as it was in Roe v. Wade. Does the same hold for publishing internal cases? In EEOC guidelines, invalid accusations made in good earnest are protected from retaliatory action, including requirements for management to prohibit retaliation from co-workers that find out about the issue. Does the same hold for the now-public internal investigations? Do other employees have a right to refuse to make a statement they know will be public, and who has the responsibility for preventing the use of this resolution system as a fishing expedition? Which government authority has oversight over the process? What are the penalties for an organization which refuses to publish their internal investigations?<p>Really, a requirement that all these proceedings be public seems open for a world of pain, and I don&#x27;t see what the benefit is, given that it&#x27;s ripe for abuse.

However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;<p>Wicherts has published another article, &quot;Publish (Your Data) or (Let the Data) Perish! Why Not Publish Your Data Too?&quot;[3] on how important it is to make data available to other researchers. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence. When I see a new publication of primary research in that discipline, I don&#x27;t take it seriously at all as a description of the facts of the world until I have read that independent researchers have examined the first author&#x27;s data and found that they check out. Often the data are unavailable, or were misanalyzed in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/10/pubpeer-files-motion-dismiss-sarkar-defamation-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://retractionwatch.com/2014/12/10/pubpeer-files-motion-d...</a><p>[2] Jelte M.

There were so many times when I just could never get a pickup on the peninsula.   With Uber/Lyft, no matter how busy it is, or what concerts are playing, I can always get a ride.  100% of the time.  (And yes,  I know surge pricing makes those rides pricey, but I would <i>much</i> rather pay 3x or 4x and have a ride in 5 minutes than spend an hour to 90 minutes waiting for a cab. )<p>o When the driver/dispatch claims they are on the way - they always show up.  Not only do they always show up, they show up reasonably on time.   And, better yet, I can see if they are moving in my direction.  That real-time car location technology is a major innovation.<p>o The feedback mechanism means I haven&#x27;t been picked up by one psycho, or in one half-broken down vehicle yet.  I&#x27;m not claiming they haven&#x27;t existed on Uber/Lyft, I&#x27;m certain they have.  But, those types of drives will be downvoted so quickly they&#x27;ll cease to be a driver very quickly.  With Taxis, I had a <i>ton</i> of drivers on the peninsula I dreaded being picked up by.  One of them was frequently undergoing some weird psychotic episodes which had him shouting out to voices.  Another was just an asshole.  I frequently got into old cars with non-working windows, and often doors that would not open from the inside.<p>o No screwing around having to &quot;pay through an app&quot; - you don&#x27;t pay - you just book your ride and get out at your destination.  Particularly when you have a bunch of bags and stuff - that&#x27;s awesome.<p>These are just a few of the reasons why Uber/Lyft changed everything.

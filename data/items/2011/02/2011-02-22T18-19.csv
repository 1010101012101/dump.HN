There is no need to point out/talk about the one you mention - every action anyone does is/can be argued for self satisfaction/gain of some sort - since everyone does it already. Yes I agree with that one. However, the gain I'm talking about is taking away a physical object away from someone else for the sake of gaining possession of it. Again, this is not what motivated the kid to break in and obtain a copy of the source code. However this type of gain is exactly what motivated the guy from Roosevelt's story. My original reply was trying to point out this difference.<p><i>>...you cannot recognise the significance of actions beyond their physical consequences.</i><p>Yes I can. Not only I can, I am also making a distinction between the actions with obvious physical consequences and the actions with less/no obvious physical consequences. It is <i>you</i> who insist on generalizing the two into the same thing and cannot see the (somewhat subtle) difference.<p><i>>The only way he could fail to be aware of the negative repercussions is if he accidentally took the source code and thought it was something else. He clearly did know what the code was, its value and why it was protected...</i><p>I beg to differ. That is just one extreme way. It is definitely not the <i>only</i> way he could have failed to be aware of the negative ramification. This is where evaluating his intentions/motivations is helpful. He loves the Valve company. He wants to play this game that he's been waiting for 4 years to ship. But the game keeps on getting delayed. He wants know the progress of the game's development. So then he decides looking at the source code is a good way to achieve this. I think it's very reasonable to argue that, ""Had he known that by doing what he did would only further delay the game he wants to play and cause his heroes a lot of trouble, he would not have done it."" The ramifications in this case is not as nearly as straight forward compared to breaking into a factory for the sake of gaining possession of the factory's secret plans. I really hope you can see this difference.<p><i>>so i don't see how what he did was any different from someone breaking into a factory and stealing secret plans</i><p>I think I've already done the best I can to explain to you the differences. If you still cannot see it then you are just going to have to figure this one out on your own/with someone else. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Dichotomy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Dichotomy</a>

    - How computer memory is organized/optimized
      (and how the abstractions involved can break down)
    - How compilers/interpreters/computer languages work
    - How a handful of the most commonly used algorithms work
      (and the implications of their time/space complexity)
    - How networks are organized and implemented
    - What operating systems do, and how that relates to hardware
    - Basic security, how exploits work
</code></pre>
The thing I see, is a lot of people learn something about the above, but only in the very narrow confines of their particular web development stack.  I suspect they're just reciting a set of best practices by rote without understanding principles.  They're completely unable to <i>generalize</i> the knowledge, to the point where they say patently incorrect things in comments, even sometimes here on HN.  If people can't generalize in a basic way about computer systems, how do they properly think about things like security?<p>It's like my sister, who is a choreographer and has an exquisite understanding of physics and geometry -- as it applies to dancers.  Yet, as far as I can tell, she's completely unable to generalize this to driving and furniture, though she would benefit greatly if she could overcome this limitation.  For one thing, when she's driving the family around in a rented car in Italy, she wouldn't end up straddling the center line <i>every time</i> we go around a blind curve.  For another thing, her DIY kitchen table made from salvaged parts wouldn't have 3 inches of shear wobble, and her custom desk made from IKEA parts wouldn't have a huge sag in its center.  I know she understands the physical ideas behind static mechanics and diagonal bracing applied to dance.  I know she has a knack for spatial geometry, because she can have a half dozen dancers move around between each other, keep them from colliding, get everyone where they need to go for the next move, and make the whole thing look beautiful.<p>I'm also reminded of that Richard Feynman story about teaching physics in Brazil.",1298398822

So I would like to try my hand at continuous deployment.<p>I am using django as my web framework and have had a lot of success in the past for building quick sites for friends and family.<p>I currently have a two tree development, a ""frontpage"" and a ""master"". The frontpage is not moving and only contains enough backend to run my landing page/beta testing scripts. But I am getting closer to MVP and I would like to replace the frontpage with a moving ""master"". This master would maintain the frontpage/beta testing scripts but allow logins for initial first adopters.<p>I have looked into migration addons such as: django-south and django-evolution. And I am currently at a good crossroads to implement one of them.<p>I am asking the community for their general experiences implementing continuous deployment and any django specific continuous deployment schemes.<p>Thanks!",1298398157

2250787,comment,2249918,2250204,0,0,rayiner,,,"It's scary because it's old and ALL IN CAPS. Modern Lisp code is much easier to read, especially in a proper editor with syntax highlighting and braces matching. Eg, fib in C:<p><pre><code>  int fib(int n) {
      if(n < 2) return n;
      return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
  }

  (defun fib (n)
      (if (< n 2)
          n
          (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
</code></pre>
The parens aren't really that annoying once you get used to them, and I personally find them a lot less distracting than the profusion of commas and curly braces that C-syntax languages use in their place. Eg:<p><pre><code>  {{""apples"", RED}, {""bananas"", YELLOW}, {""oranges"", ORANGE}}

  '((""apples"" RED) (""bananas"" YELLOW) (""oranges"" ORANGE))
</code></pre>
Also, don't forget that abstraction makes everything more readable:<p><pre><code>  (dolist (var '(1 2 3 4)) (princ a))

  for(list::iterator itr = list.begin(); itr != list.end(); ++itr) {
    cout << *itr;
  }</code></pre>",1298397876

But it was another feature I had to kill. I find the hardest thing about building a site is killing stuff. It took me forever to strip out as much as I could from hn-books. Right now I'm a bit shy of starting to put stuff back in. Over and over again it looks like whatever I add -- reviews for tools, a link to get your own Kindle, a new question category, live real-time commenting with social links -- all seems to meet with some resistance from the community. I'm never sure if I'm hurting the community or just making artistic decisions that some small percentage of people don't like.<p>I really like hackerbooks with the simple categories and multiple books above the fold. One of the emails I got recently was from a guy who set up a ""bookshelf"" with books on it -- an image of a real bookshelf with what looked like real hacker books sitting on it. That was pretty cool too.<p>When I set the site up, I consulted with a few HNers about this very issue -- how to sort/filter. Like you, I'm still not happy with where it is right now.<p>So I'm open-minded, I'm just keeping the bar a bit high for any changes right now. One of the most difficult things I am learning is to separate what might be cool from what might be best. Still working on it. If you guys keep asking for tag clouds, happy to put them in.<p>EDIT: Bit of trivia, if you hold down ""ctrl"" and click on questions in hn-books you can apply multiple filters. So say you only had time to read 1 book, but wanted to know as much as you could about ""how do I make beautiful web pages"" and ""How do I tell people about my business"". You just ctrl-click on both, then get a list of books that covers both questions: <a href=""http://hn-books.com/#BC=0&EC=0&FC=0&Q0=1&Q1=3&QC=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn-books.com/#BC=0&EC=0&FC=0&Q0=1&Q1=...</a> Not sure tags would work that way by default (Also this is probably a great example of something I spent time putting in that means absolutely nothing to anybody)",1298397668

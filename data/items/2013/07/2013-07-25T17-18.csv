It&#x27;s better for the ad network as well since their customers (the advertisers) will get better results.<p>Intent mining is really more about analyzing what people are saying online (or, equally, the text they&#x27;re entering via search engines) and working out what they are intending to do - are they looking to purchase a camera, or are they looking for information about a business?<p>The two aren&#x27;t completely separate - remarketing combined with intent mining could presumably have some interesting results (we&#x27;ve seen you were investigating shoes yesterday, and you&#x27;re travelling to a mall - I&#x27;ll show you some adverts from shoe stores there), but they&#x27;re slightly logically different.",1374775162

We are just about to hire another full-time person to help us with this as we scale out our consulting-as-onboarding process. I promise to write a blog post once I have more data on how well this works, but I will say this: You can get a well-qualified person in the U.S. who&#x27;s smart, technically savvy (not a programmer but knows his/her way around computers), and has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a related field for $40K/year in salary--and that&#x27;s a step up from where many of these folks are today.<p>I&#x27;m really excited to have a FT person working on this, and I think in the future we&#x27;ll see the &quot;hacker/hustler/designer&quot; trio that Dave McClure et.al. are so fond of speaking of expand into four people, with the fourth being a customer service/customer onboarding role. In fact, this is our fourth FT person on the team (other 3 are two savvy developers plus me, the business brain.) A designer will be our fifth hire.<p>More data: We plan to implement consulting-as-onboarding for any plan priced over $499/mo (which is our sweet spot right now), and, in fact, &quot;do it for them&quot; in terms of getting all their data into our system (which is where many of our customers are struggling now.) If it works and pays off in terms of customer acquisition and retention, I have full plans to do this for EVERY customer. I learned how to do this in the hosting industry--Rackspace was my example 10 years ago, and I did this with <i>massive</i> success with my hosting company as well. It was also one of my top tips for WP Engine when I consulted there.<p>P.S. Patrick, if you&#x27;re still reading, we talked about doing a podcast, and this is what we should talk about.

Living organisms appear (IMO, and subtly in other research) to be able to detect code base tampering, and reject it. How do they reject it? Infertility.<p>I <i>am</i> a farmer and it is difficult as hell to create a non-GMO farm (non-GMO contaminated mulch and compost, non-GMO animal feeds, non-GMO source animals, non-GMO seed). The OP is correct in all points about Monsanto&#x27;s power over seed production, but misses what SciAm (and almost everyone else) misses:<p><i>Genetic material is code being used in a production environment!</i><p>As such it needs to be protected. Code contamination (forks) need to be registered publicly and isolated with extreme prejudice from the production environment. We didn&#x27;t write the code, and as far as I am concerned, I feel that Monsanto as a policy maker (by default or by lobbing) and any of the most advanced geneticists are script kiddies on a Galactic scale. We will get to adequate understanding it time, but that time is not now. Who gives a fk if you or your grandmother can live a longer or more pain-free life if the result is a global genetic seg-fault? I don&#x27;t.<p>My answer is to set up my own isolated farm, as free of GM as I can make it. As I see it, existing organisms do have a genetic conversation (via viruses and other single cell organisms) and will resist and correct some amount of genetic contamination. Honestly I have my doubts that even this will work, but its the most I can do.<p>Food for thought.",1374775110

6103630,comment,6100794,6101102,1,0,DaniFong,,,"In his own words:<p>&quot;The patent system exists to give economic incentive to create inventions -- not products. After all, profit is the incentive to create and sell products. In order to have a level playing field, inventors must have a full set of rights, regardless of whether they are big or little, or whether they make products or just invent. Those rights are what give them the incentive to work long and hard on new ideas that may not work. A lot of big innovative companies agree with this -- companies like DuPont, GE, Qualcomm and 3M, as well as the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, have filed amicus briefs in support of MercExchange and equal rights for all inventors.&quot;<p>&quot;Perhaps the biggest myth is the danger &quot;patent trolls&quot; -- people who supposedly manipulate the patent system in a shady way. It does happen, but apart from some anecdotes, no evidence has been offered that patent trolls are a major problem. Court records show that only 2% of all patent lawsuits are due to plaintiffs that have no ongoing product business. Of that 2%, the vast majority are perfectly legitimate companies or universities. A tiny minority of patent suits are due to bad actors, but it&#x27;s hardly a crisis. While I was at Microsoft, we encountered a couple of patent manipulators, but frankly we won those cases; at worst they were a nuisance.&quot;<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114368437650611883.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114368437650611883.html</a><p>I think that on the balance IV in actual operation strives to create a good working environment for inventors and invention. I think that the invention session s that they holds and the work they do to commercialize is in fact a significant, genuine positive.<p>I think they are actually trying to do good, and are a net plus within the existing system.<p>That said, I think the existing system has long outlived its usefulness. I think, today, it is a net negative. The biggest problems: overhead, unclear rights, patents that should never have been granted, the assumption of validity, thickets, and injunction as the primary right. That, and the fact that it is difficult to willingly give one&#x27;s inventions to the public.<p>But I have come around on much. In previous eras, I gave the honor to those who could create products and companies around their inventions. Ideas were cheap, I would say.<p>In fact, it takes immense determination to legitimately reduce an idea to practice -- the intended goal of a disclosure in the patent system. Through immense effort I have learned the ropes, learning to found companies and manage them, raise money, find markets, plan, recruit and manage commercialization and manufacturing. I might only get 10 - 20% of my time to invent. It is absurd that we ask all of our inventors to do this simply to make a buck. For every one of me there would be dozens who either couldn&#x27;t, or shouldn&#x27;t have to.<p>In private discussions with Nathan, he is well aware -- more than I -- of the limitations in the patent system. Nonetheless, within that system, he is trying to do a good thing. I do not call this evil.<p>My own company has essentially had its strategy forced upon us. We have applied for nearly 80 patents, at great expense of time and money, to defend ourselves from other companies. We had a great many ideas. Eventually, several multi-billion dollar organizations became interested in a few ideas we had patented. Each would be worth a huge amount to their organization if the product was successful. Should we not license the patent because the patent system is &quot;evil?&quot; Occasionally the system actually fulfills its stated purpose.<p>Intellectual ventures buys intellectual property, often directly from inventors. It sells particular chunks to interested buyers. In one, highly controversial &quot;peacekeeping&quot; tactic, IV buys and assembles bundles of packets, to destory packet thickets and get &quot;live ammo&quot; out of the play. They then license the bundles to large organizations, like Microsoft, Cisco, Apple. The big guys; selling them the closest form of freedom to operate that exists in todays world.<p>Is this evil? I think not. At the end of the day, through IV&#x27;s actions, inventors get checks in the mail, large corporations get more freedom to operate, lawsuits that might have existed are defused, and some of the ideas that make the giant tech megacorps so profitable are actually paid for, to some extent, to their originators and appraisers. That is how the system is supposed to work.<p>It might be that the system has so much collateral damage that all these activities are a net negative. But let us not begrudge IV their intent. If actors are legally trying to do good within a flawed system, and in the process doing more harm than good, it is a flaw of the system more than the actor.<p>I basically think they&#x27;ve taken the flak for being a &quot;patent troll&quot; simply because they were a prominent target. They are scapegoating, without good judgement.<p>In fact, I believe IV is, at worst, misguided and large enough that missteps cause devastation out of line snd proportion to their intent, and at best, genuinely working to usher in a new age of private invention.",1374773461

6103447,comment,6100957,6100957,1,0,nerdzero,,,"This is really interesting.  Nice find.  Here&#x27;s a very brief summary: Participants were shown a few words and then four different identifiers, one of which matched the words and three of which did not.  The example in the paper is:<p>phrase: &quot;full pathname&quot;<p>identifiers: fill_pathname, full_mathname, full_pathnum, full_pathname<p>From the conclusions section:
&quot;Although, no difference was found between identifier styles with
respect to accuracy, results indicate a significant improvement 
in time and lower visual effort with the underscore style. The 
interaction of Experience with Style indicates that novices 
benefit twice as much with respect to time, with the underscore
style. This implies that with experience or training, the
performance difference between styles is reduced. These results
add to the findings of Binkley et al.s study&quot;<p>So, finding the correct identifier was just as likely regardless of style but the correct identifier was found faster if it was using underscores as opposed to camelCase.<p>I think the underscores acted as &quot;whitespace&quot; in this study which in my experience is the most important factor in how quickly you can visually parse code.  However, from a subjective/aesthetic perspective, I still prefer using camelCase over underscores.",1374771653

For now it is - allegedly - being used purely to identify and track bad elements, but these dubious &#x27;values&#x27; exist in the data regardless (and, notably, also for attackers).<p>Knowing the intent of individuals and what they plan to do would clearly be massively valuable as well - PKD &#x27;pre-crime&#x27; springs to mind, and I think Eric Schmidt was <i>strongly</i> signalling to the world that Google is hunting this value aggressively during this 2010 interview:<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/eric-schmidt-we-know-where-you-are-we-know-where-youve-been-we-can-more-or-less-know-what-youre-thinking-about-2010-10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/eric-schmidt-we-know-where-yo...</a><p>As connectivity spreads and devices become closer to our biological selves, this is only going to become more accurate - and thus more powerful and controlling for anyone with the ability to use and see the data.<p>The real questions I have are: how accurate are these predictions really (is Google anywhere near as advanced as their public statements would have us believe?), and how many organized criminals / terrorists will in their right minds continue to use these services, extrapolating, as they must, about these directions as well.  With the current silicon valley mindset, the technologies to support all this infrastructure <i>will</i> be pursued even if for reasons of pure capital - they all align perfectly with valid use cases in the advertising, sales and marketing realms. (see: intent analysis)<p>I think there is a dream of purely computerized security based on &#x27;enough&#x27; global buy-in to US-based services, aligned with sufficient communications interception.  For example, if 70% of the world uses US services for communications, perhaps that is enough to identify suspicious holes/gaps/anomalies in social networks - as well as simpler patterns of criminal behaviour within the covered communications - and thus anticipate problems.<p>But whether this is near a reality, and whether the ones who suffer on aggregate are {citizens/residents} or {organized crime, terrorists} I think is very unclear without transparent statistics on coverage / actual crime preventions / etc.  I would <i>guess</i> that the NSA, GCHQ, Facebook, Google et al are not there yet, but what they have done is create an arms race where if they do not follow-through, others elsewhere may do - and thus it <i>has</i> become a matter of national security (in terms of supremacy of the allies) after all.<p>Frankly I would question given the financial crisis whether they are even hunting the right targets, but direction is presumably still set from a political and defence angle as opposed to overall public good.<p>Given that other nations are likely now following in these same footsteps, I think it is <i>extremely</i> important that the US sets good precedents, because others will take their lead.  And to make a parallel with the cold war, it seems like resolution of this kind of arms race would need co-ordination and agreement with other international spy agencies - after all, the volumes and value of the data/analysis they are storing is presumably as potentially destabilizing to international safety as nuclear stockpiling is.",1374771623

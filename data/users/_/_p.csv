I particularly have a passion for products that I can personally relate to. After working in investment banking, merger and acquisition, and business development, I ""hacked some system"", in 2008 to attend Stanford Graduate School of Business and pursue my entrepreneurial goal. My hobbies include traveling, art, food, board games and most recently video making (check out my latest: http://bit.ly/ngnvideo3 and more to come on this site: http://bit.ly/gradnet)! I love observing the beauty of humanity through different lenses whether through friends, travel, or art. Having lived in three continents, I love meeting new and different people. My previous work experiences involved a lot of working with people and that was always the part I enjoyed the most, more than building complex financial models. Painting and designing products allow me to release creativity. Finally, board games provide a great playground for strategies and spending time with interesting friends.",1265162386,1452888852

iPredatorInc,0,1,0.0,2,0,"iPredator Inc. was founded in September 2011 to provide educational and advisory products & services to consumers and professional institutions on cyber bullying, cyber stalking, internet predators, cybercrime, internet libel, digital reputation and digital forensic psychology. Owned by New York State licensed psychologist and certified forensic consultant, Dr. Michael Nuccitelli, his goal is to reduce victimization, theft and disparagement from online assailants.\nAt the center of IPI's products, services and marketing strategy is Dr. Nuccitelli's two theoretical constructs, iPredator & Dark Psychology. Over the last 2 years, Dr. Nuccitelli has dedicated himself to learning the psychological composition of those engaged in malevolent activities using information and communications technology (ICT.) On 10/19/11, Dr. Nuccitelli received confirmation that his construct, iPredator, was the cover story in the December 2011, fall/winter issue of The Forensic Examiner published by the American College of Forensic Examiners International (ACFEI.)\nOver the last two years, Dr. Nuccitelli has compiled an enormous database leading to his development of online risk probability assessments designed for parents, businesses, teens, adults and public figures. Concurrent with these assessments, IPI will offer a unique advisory-based membership service, iPredator Protected, on the appropriate strategies for prevention, intervention and guidance if targeted by an iPredator.  \nOnce iPredator.co is launched in January 2012, visitors will have free access to their entire resource library of information on cyber bullying, cyber stalking, cyber crime, child predators, forensic psychology, dark psychology, iPredator and exploration of the criminal/deviant mind.",1324939403,1452899157

There are some bad sides, too : I'm not always on time, I might keep your pen and I like wine. For the Californian part : I'm a dreamer.

The day job isn&#x27;t always fun or challenging, so I find other things to do like search and rescue and musical groups. Also tried my hand at consulting around 2000-2001, failed; tried another startup based on a GPS logger concept that never got off the ground. Would like to contribute to open source, but the aforementioned extra-curricular activities get in the way.

We have a grand vision about our product, but for now the SpokenBits iOS Application allows you to give it any of your favorite articles or blog posts&#x27; URLs (in any language), and it will extract the uncluttered context from it and read it for you. Think of it as mini Audio Book of your favorite articles or blog posts.<p>Why\nWe the founders love reading a good article or blog post, and it was hard to keep up with our always increasing queue of articles. Then we thought &quot;what if I could listen to these articles during my commute ?&quot;. As you can imagine, we are scratching our own itch with the SpokenBits iOS Application, and we&#x27;ve been using and loving it since the very early prototypes.

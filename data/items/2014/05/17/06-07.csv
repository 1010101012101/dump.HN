I mean the &quot;expensive&quot; is a guess, but given that they do not list prices on their website but ask you to contact their sales department, we can assume they are far from cheap.<p>In a world where you can develop commercial, closed source software in all popular languages using free tools this seems anachronistic. I understand that AdaCore needs to make money somehow and this is probably the best business strategy for them, but still, it seriously limits the appeal. The appeal of Ada in general too, because it seems there is no (truly) free, modern Ada compiler.<p>Interestingly enough the situation seems to be similar for most of the failed languages of days gone by.

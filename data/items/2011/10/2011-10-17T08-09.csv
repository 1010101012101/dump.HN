And ""The Ubuntu Way"" seems to be being forced on ""power users"".<p>It's a great shame.  Linux does need an easy to use OS, and Ubuntu has filled that role for a while now, and will continue to do so.  But the great thing about Ubuntu was that power users could use it as well.  Now some people are going to migrate to other distributions (debian for power users, mint for people who dislike the idea of an ""easy to use, linux for newbies"").",1318841722

But they don't have to, because brands on the internet too are becoming localized.<p>A Swedish email company may very well co-exist with Sendgrid, catering to other Swedish companies. The Swedish startup Kundo competes successfully with GetSatisfaction, in Sweden. A company specializing in sending out the same email to many people instead of one-to-one, may co-exist with Sendgrid, just as Mailchimp is.<p>Create a matrix with the dimensions [every thinkable service a company needs] x [the number of possible functional specializations for each service] x [the number of geographical markets] x [the number of possible target groups in each geographical market] x [the number of companies that can co-exist catering to each target group] and you get a search space that can fit as many startups as there are sands in Sahara. Even with a very low fill-factor of that matrix there is room for millions of companies to co-exist over the entire planet.<p>The debate is not to what extent there are huge numbers of market opportunities, because it's a fact that there are. But whether a larger corporation is more fit to compete within that matrix than many smaller ones. That balance is rapidly shifting. The flatness of the Internet does cause a lot of ""winner takes all"" scenarios, but it also makes it possible for the winner to be a small company.<p>A company like Google still has to do PR to compete with Sendgrid if they create their own email sending service. Yes, they have their brand recognition to leverage, but it's possibile for Sendgrid to say ""Google has mediocre customer services and may be a great search company, but we do only what we do best and that is one-to-one email sending with excellent customer service"".<p>And people are increasingly discovering that it is on a personal level more gratifying to be the founder of a small company competing for a very specialized market opportunity than to be an employee in a large company competing for a very broad market opportunity.",1318841621

3119709,comment,3119155,3119461,2,0,masklinn,,,"> The way the do notation syntax (used by most people for describing monads) in Haskell translates to function application allows you to do some fairly interesting things with syntax abuse.<p>Sure but it's not syntax redefinition.<p>> Interestingly, C++11 now allows you to override string literals, so you can actually do this.<p>You still have a literal string notation. Literal notations don't have to impede multiple implemetations, and the truth is there is generally a primary representation used for the vast majority of cases (even if that representation is a cluster class and flexible under the interface).<p>In Cocoa, the primary sequence and maps are NSArray and NSDictionary, what would be the issue with making those literal? And one of your objections is<p>> When this suddenly matters, you are in the situation where what you want to be able to do is to make a very small modification to areas of your code where you need to select a different algorithm, in order to get the different result; you don't want to be forced to rewrite half your code to use a different syntax just because it was slow<p>But that makes no sense: as long as all equivalent containers implement the same interface (which they do, or you can't swap them anyway) that creating an object be done with a literal or with a constructor and a bunch of messages has no influence on the rest of the code, the only thing you need to change is the initialization code in both cases.<p>Hell, a smart enough editor can even swap between the literal and the ""constructor"" versions of a given collection (IntelliJ can do that for Python dicts, for instance). Not to mention in many cases the non-literal can just take the literal as a parameter, if the collection with a literal syntax has been well chosen, that way you get your cake eat it.",1318841172

Where I live, if I earn double what two people in a relationship each individually earn, the couple make an extra 12% after-tax vs. what I do because they are taxed at a lower rate on their lower individual incomes.  Furthermore, while two people eat and poop twice as much as one person, the greatest expenses (living) can often be shared.",1318838570

It's popular and fun to give Apple all the credit, and they made a great purchase.<p>But this is not a story about Apple the innovator. This is a story about a startup that won big. That they were bought by Apple and integrated instead of remaining a strong new company is more a reflection on the current state of the software business than anything else.<p>All credit to the Siri team and the projects that it is derived from. The funding for this includes government (DARPA) as well as several academic institutes:<p><i>""Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Massachusetts, the University of Rochester, the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, Oregon State University, the University of Southern California, and Stanford University, as well as from SRI.""</i><p>References:<p><a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_stealth_startup_siric.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/semantic_stealth_startu...</a><p><a href=""https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pal.sri.com/Plone/framework</a>",1318838552

You can open a sub-menu to access the various instances, you could open the most recently used one, or you could bring all of them to the front.<p>Unity basically does the latter. I like docks, but I don't like having to click twice to access an application, so it works well for me.",1318838545

And, can be rolled over -- at worst, rolled over at historically prevailing interest rates.<p>Off balance sheet liabilities are more of a concern than the official debt.  The declining ability of the US to repay debt is a major concern (due to declining competitiveness).  The actual level of official debt right now isn't itself a huge concern.",1318838463

Imagine trying to work with different projects that have different versions of ruby, different versions of rubygems and different versions of  rails, some gems from github, some gems from source, some gems from rubygems.<p>A beginner would not be able to sort through the dependency mess this creates. Gemsets help you avoid this nightmare.",1318838405

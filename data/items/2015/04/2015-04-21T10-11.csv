9413195,comment,9412872,9412872,0,0,jonchang,,,"I can say with confidence that this sort of thing would never occur in a modern research laboratory. Note that standards for ethical experimentation on animals (including humans) hadn&#x27;t really appeared until the 70s and 80s. A couple of points here:<p>Any type of animal experimentation must be accompanied by an IACUC protocol that is approved by a committee, typically at least 3 people, and usually including a veterinarian, research scientists, and layperson. The protocol justifies why using animals is necessary for the research and exactly how the animals will be cared for during the experiments.<p>Performing surgery on live animals - You have to be trained in the procedure by practicing on dead animals first. Any surgery that happens must be done under anesthesia using approved chemicals. For example, in fishes and amphibians, this is an anesthetic dose of MS-222.<p>Sacrificing animals - Typical standards require that the experimenter sacrifice the animal quickly & humanely, using at least 2 methods (chemical and physical) to ensure that the animal is not suffering due to a sublethal dose of your chemical. Again for fishes, this is a lethal dose of MS-222 followed by either pithing or freezing. For rodents this is usually anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation.<p>Experimental endpoints - You will not get your IACUC approved if you don&#x27;t have a way of dealing with your live animals after your experiment is over. Simply killing them because you don&#x27;t have money to keep them around is absolutely forbidden. For fishes, they get released back into the ocean or kept around for aquarium outreach purposes.<p>The issue of animal rights is an important one. For example I personally think that the IACUC protocols don&#x27;t go far enough. Nonvertebrate animals are typically not covered by IACUC at all so this means that it is legally above the board to vivisect slugs without anesthesia. Of course you might not think that slugs deserve rights but this is a debate that needs to happen. In particular many countries do not cover cephalopods (octopuses, squids, etc) under their animal use laws..",1429613432

And you don&#x27;t need http mode for this.<p>2) HTTP performance (and performance in general) is now much better.  Particularly on newer kernels (IIRC somewhere in the 3.12-3.15 range, when splice was fixed for small objects).<p>3.  I&#x27;m not sure why you found it fragile.  I&#x27;ve run HAProxy in HTTP mode at much higher QPS volumes than you were seeing - this did require a bunch of tuning, and I&#x27;m actually hoping to have time sometime in the next few weeks to write some articles on doing this.  But it worked, and worked well.<p>What&#x27;s worked well for me is the following:<p><pre><code>           /-  [haproxy]
  [router] --  [haproxy]
           \-  [haproxy]
</code></pre>
Using anycast routing to distribute the load over the haproxy servers, who run BIRD[1].  It&#x27;s simple and pretty effective - although you want to chose your router hashing method carefully, and if you use persistance (stick tables) you <i>have</i> to use a recent version of haproxy, with support for peering.<p>It is difficult to make it work, though - just how difficult I only recently appreciated when trying to help a friend over IRC make haproxy scale to very high volumes.  I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll find the time to write the articles I mentioned above, which will hopefully be useful to others with this sort of problem to solve.<p>1: <a href=""http://bird.network.cz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bird.network.cz/</a>",1429611541

I&#x27;d personally love to see more Aussies where I am from staying local rather than heading stateside when their funding needs come up as well as the benifits this can bring to poorer countries.<p>However it&#x27;s really not good news if it is a bubble. My take from the article, while companies may be pulling a profit, given the average valuations they are still extremely overvalued. If this is the case absolute profit means diddly without income to value ratio and there will be a rude awaking when people realise this as we have seen repeatedly in history. Unfortunately finance world errors like this flow heavily into day to day life of everyone else.<p>And as for people crying out &quot;bubble bubble !&quot; on china for 10 years. In my life typically people make these claims for years pre-implosion (see dot-com bubble) almost to the point you get skeptical and think they are naysayers, and then it happens. And if this market pops, people wont trust the sector for some time after a bust forcing people out of the tech industry, general flow on repercussions to the economy, let alone the international repercussions for an economy the size of China.",1429611420

It&#x27;s costly for the employer, time consumer for both of you and the odds of getting accepted are small. If you were to find some company willing to spend the time and money to get you there through that process, you would have the job you like already and would just have stumbled upon an insanely great opportunity. It doesn&#x27;t look like that&#x27;s the case.<p>Regarding the fact that all the opportunities you find require experience... Well everybody wants someone experience, it&#x27;s just must faster to get them to be working and productive. That doesn&#x27;t mean all companies will find that person. Itcould be because there is more demande than people looking for a new job with that skillset or because they don&#x27;t want to pay enough. When that happens, they&#x27;ll have to resort to hiring someone with less experience than they hoped for, and that&#x27;s where you come in. Show that you&#x27;re good, have some pet projects to show you know something about the language already, be great during the interview and you could get hired.<p>Job offers describe the ideal candidate, not the mandatory requirements, even when it says so, companies will do with what they get so apply anyway and see how that goes. I never fully met the requirements for the jobs I applied to when I got hired, and it forced me to level up, learn new things and tackle challenges, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal and you still have a shot.",1429611182

I know they're not all going to be hitting the site simultaneously, but I believe each request to rails blocks.<p>So at 4 Mongrels a virtualized server I'd need 250 to serve 1K simulataneous users.  Is there a good metric for breaking down how many simul users I should plan for based on the total number of users?\ncomments, links, ridicule welcome\nTIA",1200891436

I was in amazing shape, rode my bike along the Continental divide, got a below freezing outfit to hit the road as soon as the snow was plowed in the winter, amazing skiing up Interstate 70.  But if you're looking for fine art, symphony, theater, opera, great dining, etc, this is not a good place to be.  For a shorter period though - a great experience.",1200889363

For instance, it might be better to teach kids how to manipulate an existing program, like changing the color of a circle that is being drawn, or changing the radius. Slowly, you could introduce more complexity in the modifications. Trying to teach kids a language outright wouldn't be feasible.",1200888999

We also had the experience of people saying ""yeah, we don't really know how well our algorithms our doing, so if you can develop software to tell us, we'll pay you big bucks.""  (Though, last I heard, nobody had actually paid big bucks for the software we did develop.)  But it's the kind of truth that nobody really wants to face, so they just kinda acknowledge it and then go about their business.",1200888031

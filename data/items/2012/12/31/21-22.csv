Rules everywhere, for everything!<p>My favorite living and working conditions are those where there are no rules simply because they aren't necessary--a very productive sort of anarchy.

If I owned it, they also respected my ownership/privacy over it. Because of this, I feel like I grew up with a good sense of judgement, and a feeling like I could be trusted.<p>When I look at this list of rules with my ""younger"" eyes, I see a leash -- this isn't so much a present for me as much as an additional way to keep tabs/hold authority over for the mother. Children need to feel like they have some privacy, and I'm sorry, but knowing your parents can log in and see everything your doing, along with a laundry list of things you can't do makes things the kid might find fun suddenly an experience in anxiety.<p>What I want to know is, if the kid said no, and used his personal savings/worked a job to get his own phone, would the mom still have this list of things he would need to do, even if he never asked for a dime of help?

It is not circumstance that dictates the skills someone acquires. That is 110% you, and don't let some nobodies try to take that away from you. They could have had the same things you did, and they still would not have achieved what you did, and they know it. They just want to project their shortcomings onto you to make them feel better about themselves.<p>Most people I know who consider themselves good with computers only know how to use them for gaming. I don't have interest in gaming and I make no apologies for that. I'd rather spend my time learning new things and if that happens to make me more money down the road, I see no reason I should have to make excuses for it.<p>If you still think you're privileged, go and try teaching somebody all the right things to do. Give them the best advice you can until your tongue falls out. Give them every opportunity you wish you had. I guarantee it will all be a waste of time, and later on, that same person will still want to tell you all about how didn't earn your success.<p>It's one thing to be grateful about something, but its another thing to try to make excuses for yourself. Making up excuses for success is just as bad as making up excuses for mistakes. It's your fault, own up to it, and don't let anyone (not even yourself) tell you it was just circumstance.",1356990562

Similarly, 'The Blair Witch Project' was successful at the box office because it too was uploaded ""accidentally"". Coincidentally, both of these movies' box office release were within weeks of each other and did far better than they perhaps normally would have, if it hadn't been for piracy. Piracy can create a buzz or social network effect when friends talk about movies, that is far more substantial than simply seeing a trailer.

RAID5 is perfectly fine in most instances.<p>Desktop drives will drop out of RAID arrays frequently, so you have to use RAID6 if you choose to go that route. If a disk drops into deep checking mode for physical errors, then it won't respond to the RAID controller fast enough, and then be considered a dead drive.

4990975,comment,4989952,4989952,23,0,zt,,,"So, as I read through the comments on this post I see a lot of indifference to her argument and a lot of anger toward the government. Government is broken. Government uses outdated, bespoke technology from the 90s. Technology is not a priority. Government is inefficient. (I could say the same things about much of the not-for-profit community as well). \nThose are all true, but that's partially because the exact people in Silicon Valley who are capable of bringing expertise to the table are not willing to. Government's so broken it is not worth fixing is exactly the attitude that ensures that government continues to be broken. There aren't many people who live in the Valley who ask themselves how they could give back or improve society with the skills they have.<p>For example, there was just a search conducted for a new CIO of San Francisco--what would that position look like if one well-qualified engineering manager from HN left their job at Google or Facebook, sucked it up and dove in? I'll tell you what would happen--a lot of good stuff for our city and our society. I'm currently in the civic tech community of practice nationally (Today is perhaps the last day I can claim that, more on that below), and there aren't enough people who get it who are willing to work in government, but that's exactly the problem that needs to be solved. The person I know who is doing the most innovative work in civic technology is Brett Goldstein, the CIO of Chicago, who use to be the head of IT Services at OpenTable before becoming a beat cop, director of analytics for Chicago Police, Chief Data Officer of Chicago, and now CIO.[1]<p>Lets take another view of this point--there is to my knowledge no software developer in Congress. That seems like a problem to me and one that comes from the fact, perhaps, that developers are less likely to throw themselves in to politics in their 40s because of a lack of expertise. That doesn't seem to stop lawyers and other businesspeople though. I think we would be having a slightly different national conversation about technology, innovation, the internet and even the very methods by which we solve problems in our society (for the better) if some Silicon Valley folks sucked it up and got a little more involved in politics or, you know, in improving the lives of poor people. The I AM a geek campaign.<p>(By the way, I'm inherently skeptical of Ron Conway's Sf.Citi, which is basically a glorified lobbying organization against the payroll tax in SF. But, having said that, I think the attitude could be useful. I've heard it said by a few Silicon Valley billionaires that they don't want to give money to, for example, education because they don't know anything about education. What they know is how to build software products. Since that's so, why can't we come up with software products as philanthropy rather than give up on giving back [2]).<p>I think some of the passion is there but there needs to be new ways to focus that energy collectively. Just as an example, I co-founded Datakind (formerly Data Without Borders), which matches pro bono data science capacity from people who work at, for example, Google or Bit.ly, with not-for-profits that have defined data science needs and projects. The hard part here was not in finding the data science capacity--tons of people volunteered--or the not-for-profits--tons of them have signed up--but in the interface between the two. That's why the organization needs to exist, but it also points to the fact that the ecosystem of doers in Silicon Valley should give some thought of how to act as a community to bridge those gaps and provide support and help beyond the peninsula.<p>Lastly, as a personal note, I am keenly interested in this whole thing. Today is my last day as Senior Tech Policy adviser to Newark, NJ Mayor Cory Booker. I am starting next week at Stripe. The more I have worked on civic technology, the more I realized I wished I knew more about and had experience in technology in the private-sector. I feel like a sort of false prophet  one who had read about revelation but who has never experienced it himself. But my passion is in and around using technology to innovate in the civic space, particularly within government. I feel the best long-term play to do that is to work at an engineering-focused, growing, tech company for a few years. Then I can tack back to civic tech--because innovation rarely comes from people who are too far down the rabbit hole of any field. I can likely come back to civic tech after working in the private sector but there are only a few years (without a wife/partners and kids) where I am willing to work my ass off at a startup.<p>I mention all this about my own life to say that although government is hard and addressing societal problems is hard it's only by choosing to care that we can make a difference. That sounds corny, but if government is broken and you're an expert at revolutionizing business process, why don't you spend a few years working on it. I am not suggesting that everyone organize their life as I have, but if you really cared about the hardest problems you could find why isnt addressing civic and social problems on your list?<p>[1] cf. <a href=""https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/doit/auto_generated/doit_leadership.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/doit/auto_genera...</a>, <a href=""http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2011/may_2011/Mayor_elect_Emanuel_Names_Chicagos_Technology_Leadership_Team.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/...</a>, <a href=""http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1102/arts_sciences/byte-cop.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1102/arts_sciences/byte-cop.sht...</a><p>[2] I take a crack at one, not particularly modest, suggestion on this at <a href=""http://www.ash.harvard.edu/Home/Programs/Innovations-in-Government/Mayoral-Performance-Analytics-Initiative/Guest-Post-Introducing-the-idea-of-an-open-source-suite-for-municipal-governments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ash.harvard.edu/Home/Programs/Innovations-in-Gove...</a>",1356989578

TechMeetup  groups you can always expect to have a public policy aspect to the tech offerings the problem is the majority of these fail. As someone who works in the government and is part of the start-up culture, I can tell you: these attempts are typically terrible at coming up with ways to blend tech and bureaucracy. I have no idea why. Well, not no idea. I think the main hurdles are as follows:<p>1. The people who make the best change in industries or start-ups are people who have been working in it a while.<p>2. Few people who have worked in government are the types to become high-growth entrepreneurs. They exist but in general the mindsets are reciprocals.<p>3. It takes a long time (in start-up time) to understand how a federal/state/local government does things. Anyone who wants to make a mark from the outside isn't going to identify a problem/solution efficiently. So anyone who has a real solution has likely been in government for 5-10 years and is established in a comfortable position - not likely to break out. Not only that they probably have schooling in something political science-y/history/etc.. versus math/CS/physics<p>4. As a general rule, it takes a long time (infinitely long in start-up time) to actually get a federal/state/local government to implement anything. Part of this is by design and the other part is incompetence or ignorance because they have...<p>5. Really really poor understanding of how to implement technology. For example $25,000 for a shitty 4 page web 1.0 government website because that is what was budgeted and Booz Allen took the contract because...<p>6. ...they promised to make the whole thing comply with the IT requirements (ie: IE7 is the most recent browser) and security requirements.<p>So yea.

This problem interested me because I noticed that there was very little correlation between how smart my friends were and the types of offers they received. And more broadly, I noticed that most interviewers will tend to over-weight negatives. Then I realized that I did the same thing, which got me thinking.<p>I'm not just trying to find talented programmers. I'm trying to address the more general problem of figuring out whether somebody is good at X. You're right that the easiest way to judge on a case-by-case basis is to ask known experts. But since this is/was a cognitive bias of mine, I'm trying to overcome it myself.<p>I have spent a lot of time, done plenty of reading, and spent my own money on this problem. Like you said, I actually have paid experts to give me advice on how to identify talented people their field. More frequently though, I'll network and ask in an informal setting. And as a result, I have managed to severely correct several biases I had, such as thinking that anyone who couldn't do basic Math must be not be very bright.<p>One thing that's relatively easy (i.e., only took me a few months of effort) is learning how to identify generally smart people who learn fast. (I would actually divide this into learning social systems quickly vs. learning technical systems quickly.) If two people are entering a field or starting a job at the same time, I can generally predict which one of them will learn faster after a 30 minute conversation. The biggest surprise was that very smart people can be catastrophically bad at things ""normal people"" would consider basic-like eating spaghetti or not offending their interviewer (or even realizing they'd offended someone.) Before I tended to assume that fast learners would be good at most things and exceptional at a few things.<p>A more challenging problem: say I meet a lawyer, or doctor, or anyone with a lot of experience in an area I don't know much about. How can I tell if they're genuinely good at what they do? So far, general intelligence + percentile-based accomplishments (""I boosted revenues by X which is better than 95% of marketers..."") + asking them to walk through a real life situation has been my best predictor. I'll validate this by asking known experts afterwards or looking up the person's career track.<p>Even so, it's not a particularly good predictor, and asking a real expert works much better. But by looking at actual data, even if it's relatively weak and anecdotal, my ability to accurately judge competence has become much stronger over the last few years. I think this is something that most businesses could benefit from, but the more common response seems to be throwing up their hands and complaining about the lack of qualified people.<p>Edit: when I said ""how we judge talent is actually one of the biggest problems"", I should have specified ""we as a society."" It clearly came across as ""we as a company"", sorry about that.",1356989266

The reason is that the person's second order desires, feelings like the impulse to eat ice-cream or the urge to put off making a certain phone call or writing a  particular program, those desires are almost always more powerful than first order desires (like goals or ideals).<p>That's because our behavior is ruled as much or more by subconscious motives as conscious ones, and those subconscious motives aren't governed by the decisions we make or the picture we have of the life we want. They're ruled by an imprint of your childhood, by habit, and by anxiety, depression, and so on.<p>Another easy example is addiction. It's not that most alcoholics don't want to stop drinking.

On the mundane side: one of the points is that Microsoft objects to the requirement to procure the lowest-price software that meets the specs, because there is FOSS that meets many of the specs (as written) and it's no-cost, therefore no commercial supplier can possibly compete. That's an argument you'd expect any commercial software supplier to make, and in fact they do make that argument pretty much anywhere those kinds of procurement rules come up. Whether making that argument is trying to fleece the government or not probably depends on whether you agree with commercial software providers' arguments about benefits of their software vs. FOSS, e.g. in functionality and/or total cost of ownership.",1356988559

It's currently having CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control)[0] installed, which will give dispatchers much higher resolution information about the location of every train, and go a very long way towards automating the entire system. CBTC installation is scheduled to be completed in 2016, and it's the reason why there are currently so many service disruptions afflicting it during weekends (it actually just began a series of 13 consecutive weekends during which it will not go into Manhattan). If I recall correctly from the posters, the total budget of the project is about $750 million.<p>If and when the line is fully automated someday, it will become possible to create a reliable barrier mechanism (like what currently exists on the very small automated portions of the NYC subway, which is really just the JFK AirTrain). Until then, human operators can't reliably get the train cars to stop in the same place.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications-based_train_control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications-based_train_cont...</a>",1356988079

Eventually you'll muscle-memory a set of actions, for the way that you uniquely use vim, that you don't even know how to explain without thinking about it.<p>Rather than trying to go through one end of a tutorial or reference to the other (don't know if that's you), find a site or two of vim tips, and let them randomly trigger your mind. I think it's more interesting than going through anything beyond page/chapter 1 of a reference.<p>Coupled with that, whatever you find yourself doing in vim, take some time to understand what it is and the alternatives. Becoming familiar with :help's table of contents, rather than the contents of every chapter, is probably helpful here.<p>Similarly, when you do something accidentally, try to understand what happened. Sometimes you'll discover a feature. q: for example is discovered by accident by many people, including me.",1356987885

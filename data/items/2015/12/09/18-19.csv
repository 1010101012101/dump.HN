10705889,comment,10701566,10704864,0,0,100ideas,,,"Regardless of the corporate claptrap, if we give Nanobiosym the benefit of the doubt and assume their geneRADAR platform does advance the state of the art in qPCR, microfluidics, and point-of-care diagnostics, what might that advance be?<p>It may have to do with how much blood they need for each multiplex test. Clinical qPCR diagnostics need at least 5-10 uL of blood for each test (ballpark minimum). A finger prick or dried blood sample card [1] may provide enough DNA (human or pathogen depending on the test) for one or two of these tests, but not more. To run 100 or 1000 tests in parallel, a lab would need 5-50 mL of blood. Easy to get from a venous blood draw but not easy in the field.<p>So perhaps Nanobiosym is developing a reliable method purifying DNA from blood and running multiplex qPCR at nanoscale volumes, and possibly enriching the purified DNA first for particular pathogen DNA sequences with a non-qPCR method. The capability to run hundreds of qPCR-based diagnostic tests in parallel from a single finger prick of blood would result in significant improvements in clinical convenience and reagent cost-savings.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting challenge: in a person who is HIV positive but hasn&#x27;t presented with AIDS, how many viral genomes can be expected to be found on average in a single finger prick of blood (viral titer)?

10705878,comment,10702779,10703537,0,0,geebee,,,"You don&#x27;t even need to go all the way up to medicine.  According to US News and Report &quot;Best Jobs&quot;[1][2], median salaries for developers in San Francisco ($114,400), ostensibly ground zero for the &quot;shortage&quot;, are only a whisker higher than they are for dental hygienists ($112,970) and are considerably lower than for registered nurses ($127,670).<p>[1] go to US News and World Report &quot;Best Jobs&quot; and drill down by salary and region.  Alternatively, you can go to the BLS site - which is what the US News numbers are based on.<p>[2] I&#x27;d also like to acknowledge that these numbers &quot;seem&quot; low to me.  It&#x27;s based on BLS data by region, but dev salaries seem higher than this in SF.<p>I&#x27;ve posted this on HN a few times, and I&#x27;ve realized that I need to qualify this with a few statements.<p>I have no problem with nurses earning higher salaries than software developers.  It&#x27;s a difficult and vitally important job and nurses deserve their high salaries and high scores on surveys of professional respect.<p>Yes, programmers have more upside, but check the BLS directly for higher percentile salaries.  It isn&#x27;t until you get to the 90%ile for devs and nurses (in SF) that the devs earn more, and even then, it&#x27;s only by a whisker.  There are also lots of downsides - age related employment issues can get pretty bad for software developers.  I do think that nurses have better job stability, experience few age-related employment issues in middle age, and may actually have better job flexibility (they can&#x27;t wander off and get a cup of coffee whenever they feel like it like most devs can, but many nursing and medical specialties have remarkable options to scale back on work for a period of time, such as having a kid, without severely compromising the long term career path).<p>Another complicating factor - anyone who reads a book on PHP can call him or herself a &quot;software developer&quot; (though BLS stats base this on people who use the title or something similar on a tax return, I believe).  Nursing, on the other hand, requires a degree and formal licensure.  So it&#x27;s not quite apples-to-apples.  Then again, we separate out physicians from nurses, whereas we include very high salary devs in that number, so again, it&#x27;s complicated and difficult to make these comparisons.<p>Also, these are numbers for San Francisco - nurses do not out earn developers everywhere.  However, the higher concentration of devs in SF/Silicon Valley could skew the numbers as well.<p>I&#x27;ll stop here, and simply acknowledge that interpreting this data is certainly more complex than simply listing some medians.  My real problem is that most analyses of why group X isn&#x27;t going into profession Y almost never consider the possibility that this may in fact be a highly rational response to market signals.  This isn&#x27;t the only factor, and the social issues NPR mentions are highly relevant.  However, we really do need to explore the extent to which a preference for law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentisty, or even dental hygiene over software development may be highly rational.",1449687369

10705874,comment,10697939,10702991,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Sounds pretty much the same as the AAP advice, just more cynical.<p>The fundamental difference is the inclusion of &quot;guided&quot; vs &quot;unguided.&quot; There is this implicit assumption that &quot;screen time&quot; means &quot;without continuous parent interaction&quot; because our conversation is colored by the early 90s and television. The AAP advice doesn&#x27;t differentiate. There&#x27;s also a strong scent of &quot;excluded middle&quot; in your argument. Two 30 minute sessions of screen time, guided by parents, with programming specifically and scientifically designed for that age bracket is a hell of a lot different than parking your child in front of a television for 2 hours while you answer emails.<p>But even if we ignore that, 24/7 parenting presence is the province of the ultra rich, and often even then the province of women delegated to full primary caregiver status. So smug it up, friend. It&#x27;s simply not economically possible for many people.

From <i>the project&#x27;s own 5-minute introduction</i> [1]:<p>If you have just installed Maven, it may take a while on the first run. This is because Maven is downloading the most recent artifacts (plugin jars and other files) into your local repository. You may also need to execute the command a couple of times before it succeeds...The POM is huge and can be daunting in its complexity...You executed the Maven goal archetype:generate, and passed in various parameters to that goal. The prefix &quot;archetype&quot; is the plugin that contains the goal... the second [command] is simply a single word - package. Rather than a goal, this is a phase. A phase is a step in the build lifecycle, which is an ordered sequence of phases. When a phase is given, Maven will execute every phase in the sequence up to and including the one defined. For example, if we execute the compile phase, the phases that actually get executed are [list of 6 items]...Although hardly a comprehensive list, these are the most common default lifecycle phases executed [list of 10 items]...<p>So in order to use this, I have to understand its own specialized non-standard vocabulary, like artifact, repository, archetype, plugin, goal, package, phase, lifecycle...the build configuration is in XML...it does a lot of stuff automagically, like executing five extra phases or downloading dozens or hundreds of executable files from the Internet.<p>People love Maven for some reason, but I&#x27;ll use shell scripts or Ant for my Java builds, because <i>when</i> the build breaks [2], I want to be able to understand what&#x27;s going on without having to read a few hundred pages of the build system manual.<p>[1] <a href=""https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-fiv...</a><p>[2] Anyone who&#x27;s ever worked with any build system knows the build <i>will</i> break.",1449685587

You can&#x27;t say &quot;oh that&#x27;s easy - the hegemonic empire doesn&#x27;t want its stormtroopers - that would be its population - to die, because they can&#x27;t fight for hte hegemonic empire or pay their taxes&quot; because if that were the case it would ALSO be in the interests of the &quot;hegemonic empire&quot; to ban grossly unhealthy foods so people don&#x27;t die of heart disease - the U.S. has the lowest life expectancy among rich countries in part for this reason: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expe...</a>   But they don&#x27;t do that, or many other things.<p>there&#x27;s just no answer to why my grocery store isn&#x27;t allowed to sell arsenic-laced apples as long as they&#x27;re labelled, except the COMPLETELY OBVIOUS one that the government does its basic job and protects people from this thing.  there&#x27;s just no other answer.  the mental contortions you would have to go through to believe that they&#x27;re &quot;seeking to enrich their corporate sponsors&quot; and that&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t sell arsenic-laced apples is just - I mean, come on.<p>The reason you would have to put &quot;some thought&quot; into answering my questoins - even though they&#x27;re <i>super</i> simple - is the same as why a flat-earther would have to put &quot;some thought&quot; into answering the question of why someone can broadcat an image of a spinning, round, Earth, from space.  This requires some explanation, because the idea that the Earth is actually flat is so obviously untenable.<p>I was on the debate team in high school, out of these two statements: &quot;Resolved: the Earth is a flat disc, not a round sphere-like object in space&quot; and &quot;Resolved: it ought to be legal to sell apples that are or might be arsenic-laced and deadly to consumers as long as a label is affixed to them informing consumers of this fact&quot; it is absolutely easier to argue the affirmative of the former.  It&#x27;s just sooo easy, all you have to explain is a few images from space, everything else people don&#x27;t have any personal experience with.  Even the bible is on your side.  There are people who believe this <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Flat_Earth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Flat_Earth</a>  - on the other hand, everyone has purchased apples.  You won&#x27;t find anyone who would have been okay with them being arsenic-laced, as long as there is a label on them.  It&#x27;s just not something anyone can actually argue - which is why you go off on this totally irrelevant tangent about enriching corporate sponsors.<p>this entire thread with me discusses nothing but why the government shouldn&#x27;t deregulate selling poisoned food.  That&#x27;s it.  it&#x27;s obvious.  completely obvious.<p>Excuse me if there is some vitriol, but I&#x27;m not okay with someone arguing a position that I have to start reading labels on my fruits to make sure I don&#x27;t die.  It&#x27;s not a position you can take.  It&#x27;s why you had originally gotten downvoted when you asked &quot;in theory, why not&quot;.   me dying of fruit is not a small price to pay for your right to test some alternative economic theory.  you&#x27;re arguing for my death.

10705517,comment,10698478,10704103,0,0,padobson,,,"Co-dependency is definitely something to watch out for. I&#x27;ve read a number of books on the subject, and I&#x27;m a little surprised I was interpreted that way.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between healthy support and enabling bad behavior.<p>Examples:<p>Your husband is drunk in the gutter. You can A) leave him there or B) drag him inside, clean him up, and put him to bed. If you pick A, you&#x27;re allowing him to experience the consequences of his own mistakes. If you pick B, you&#x27;re enabling him and saving him from his own mistakes. The person picking B is co-dependent, not supportive.<p>A wife has always dreamed of having a lake house. The state of the house is immaterial, she just wants to walk out the back door and see the water. She finds a house they can afford now, but the husband finds the dwelling unlivable, and they&#x27;re unable to afford a nicer house. The husband can A) veto the lake house outright, saying he won&#x27;t be uncomfortable for her dreams or B) move into the house and be uncomfortable for his wife&#x27;s dreams or C) put a plan together to earn/save extra money and make sacrifices to get the house that will be agreeable to both of them. The person picking A is taking care of themselves, but sticking it to his wife. The person picking B is being co-dependent, doing something that makes him miserable for the good of their partner. The person picking C is the healthy one here, enduring shared, temporary pain to achieve an end that is agreeable to both.<p>A husband and wife have a vacation fund. They set a goal to save enough to go to Nepal the following year, and put together a savings plan to go. The wife follows the plan, sacrificing her gym membership for jogging and making fewer trips to the hair stylist. The husband ignores the plan, buys a new TV, eats at restaurants too often, and finds himself with a sizable debt at the end of the year. When it comes time to pay for the trip, the vacation fund has enough money to A) Pay for just the wife to go on the Nepal trip B) Pay for both of them to go to Disney Land instead C) Pay off the husband&#x27;s credit cards. The person who chooses C is a text-book co-dependent. The person who chooses A is probably being healthy, but missed an opportunity for relaxation with her husband. This makes B a suitable option as well. The husband still has to handle his credit card debt, but his wife was willing to sacrifice her Nepal trip so they could be together. Perhaps it will inspire the husband to change his spending habits the next time around, or perhaps next year he&#x27;ll be waving to her from the dock as she leaves on a cruise with her friends.<p>The key to avoiding codependency is setting clear, definable limits with your spouse, and then allowing them to suffer the consequences when they ignore those limits. It takes a level of self awareness to set good limits, but self awareness is not selfishness.<p>If you&#x27;re able to build a marriage around self-sacrifice that has clear, definable payoffs, then your needs will naturally begin to align and the needs of the couple will supersede the individual needs.",1449684691

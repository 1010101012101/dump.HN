None of the really good ones are open source, and the best ones I have heard of are not even for sale.<p>The best implementations make an advantage in markets so they are well guarded. We do not know about the best implementations, because we did not notice a thing. For example some phone operators have replaced their customer services with TTS / STT solutions. Because people tend to lock up when they realize they are talking with a computer, they have had to make those systems sound very natural.<p>I know a few are pretty crappy ones, but a few are plain spooky. Customers that tend to joke and flirt with the computer, hoping for an emotional response, probably are most likely to notice them.<p>Then there&#x27;s the case where the US intelligence services demonstrated their capabilities to a politician (senator/congressman) by recording him, and producing a voice clip of him saying something like &quot;death to america&quot; so well that no one could distinguish the speaker. It also seemingly passed further voice analysis. Google it up, pretty interesting read.",1445399878

Long stretches where car drivers don&#x27;t expect to slow down, will increase overall speeds. This is already evident on long neighborhood streets that don&#x27;t have stop signs, and where they are now installing speed bumps at the request of residents.<p>Perhaps not a planned benefit, but the inconvenience of stop signs also funnels car traffic onto the larger trunk roads, leaving the side streets for cyclists -- a cheap and cheerful way of separating car and bike traffic.<p>On the other hand, I suspect that stop signs are also just a cheap traffic control device that works with minimal case-by-case design, especially in neighborhoods with narrow streets. Alternatives, such as roundabouts, tend to involve complete re-design of an area with at least a 50 yard radius, for instance eliminating visual obstacles and parked cars.",1445399451

Congestion in London is really bad, not just cars, but public transport and pedestrian traffic as well.  The city has worked really hard to optimize everything for the massive movement of people.  Vans and motorbikes sometimes go onto the pavement (ie. british for sidewalk), and sometimes pedestrians overflow into the road.  Buses often go into the oncoming lane to get around other buses with the full expectation that oncoming traffic will make room for them.  All of this happens with a fraction of the road rage that you experience on much less congested US streets.  Part of it seems to just be an unspoken moral duty and perhaps even comradery of everyone doing there part to help everyone else get where they&#x27;re going.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s all rainbows and unicorns in other countries—tube/rail commuting in London can be pretty traumatic, and if there&#x27;s a strike or mechanical problems the knock-on effect through the system can be dramatic given how stretched it already is—but San Francisco transportion is drastically unoptimized (eg. BART 4-trains/hour per line vs Victoria Line 33-trains/hour) and it&#x27;s not going to get better by quibbling over rolling stops and warring between drivers and cyclists.  There was a time when the American people had the sense of duty and self-sacrifice to get on with massive transportation infrastructure projects like the Interstate Highway System (however misguided it may have been in hindsight), but now it&#x27;s all about entitlement and NIMBYism and fighting over the crumbs from a decrepit and inadequate system.",1445399147

This can be optimized in certain situation, e.g. you can crawl a product listing and only go to product details page if some basic property changed. Saving HTML for each page is certainly possible, but after the crawler finished loading a page, running a pageFunction adds very little extra overheads.<p>- if a page cannot be loaded for any reason, a detailed description of the error will be present in the JSON results. We want to implement a limited number of retries for these pages, for situations the error is just temporary.<p>- certainly, if your crawling strategy cannot be expressed using simple pseudo-URLs, you can use the low-level &#x27;interceptRequest&#x27; function to control exactly how each new page navigation request is handled (enqueued/ignored), tell the crawler which URLs refer to same pages and shouldn&#x27;t be visited again etc. You can also enqueue arbitrary pages to crawl using &#x27;context.enqueuePage&#x27;.

I actually feel much safer on two wheels than while playing frogger trying to cross a street on foot.<p>I also felt safer here on a moto than I do in SF, simply because the culture here is to accept the insanity and not fight it. In SF the &#x27;us&#x27; vs. &#x27;them&#x27; argument has gotten so out of control that I feel like many people in cars literally have put a target on my back. I get none of that attitude here in Saigon and it is refreshing.<p>So if SF wants to let cyclists yield at stop signs because it is actually safer for the cyclist, then let them do it. If you hit the cyclist with your car because they did something stupid, you aren&#x27;t going to get hurt and you won&#x27;t be liable (just like before this rule). Many other places in the world have already figured this out and are working just fine.",1445396787

Usually 45 mph roads are 2-lane, there is a perfectly serviceable extra lane for all the car drivers in a hurry.<p>> The other day everyone was patiently waiting to get around this guy going 15mph on his bicycle, and once we did, at the next stop sign he just cruised to the stop sign in the 2 foot space between the cars and the curb and blocked slowed down even more cars.<p>You were probably driving too close to him (with your rant, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised) and pushed him into that space.<p>> If you want to share the road you should be held to the same standards.

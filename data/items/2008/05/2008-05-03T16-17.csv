I was using it to fix some Safari JS bugs the other day, and then was just blown away by how much snappier it feels -- even at a perceptual level that makes a big difference. I feel bad cheating on Firefox, though.",1209833849

- Pound (http://www.apsis.ch/pound/)
- HAProxy (http://haproxy.1wt.eu/)
- Perlbal (http://www.danga.com/perlbal/)<p>Does anybody have experience using any of these, in live production environments (under reasonably heavy usage), and if so what pros and cons do you see with them ?",1209833658

Itâ€™s the people that make the difference ...""<p>I don't know much about YC since I am of a very different demographic but I would say the same thing about the people who comes to this discussion site (YC News or Hacker News) which I discovered by accident six months ago. I bet most people who keep coming back to YCN do so because of the quality of the discussion (i.e., people) as well.  And my observation is that many are coming from all over the World, with very different startup experience, and obviously of different age group (i.e., very few are YC candadates).<p>And I bet it would be difficult to replicate YCN for the same reason that it would be difficult to replicate YC.",1209833149

I don't know what it is, but for a field concerned with abstraction people miss the forest for the trees.<p>I try to catalog insights right as they happen, and try to capture the before-and-after: what, exactly, was the turning point that made it click? Unfortunately that makes articles slow coming, but I think they can be more genuine than explaining something after you're already an expert. Most of us can't remember what it was like trying to learn to read, for example -- it's too hard to relate to that problem.",1209832873

180296,comment,180233,180233,0,0,uuilly,,,"Watching NVidia make this transition has been fascinating.  The world changed when a guy wrote a log(n) sort in a graphics shader.  GPU's were really dumb parallel processors that could only work w/ 4x4 matrices.  Now they are much smarter general purpose parallel processors with languages and debugging tools.  The GPU is not just for graphics anymore.

Now, even ignoring the fact that <i>github itself is chopping those lines because they're too long</i>, they're simply not meaningfully readable.  The ridiculous repetition (which is the proximate cause of those awful line lengths) totally obscures the meaning.<p>Note all the repeated use of this weird dictionary name ""my_stats[condition][strand]"".  This thing appears, often multiple times, on ever line of that loop.  You're telling me that this couldn't be made more readable by using a simple local ""stats"" reference name ""st""?  Repetition of expressions is the sign of lazy code, it's the same kind of thought process that gives us cut-and-paste bugs.<p>Note likewise the repated use of ""kc_stats[condition]"".  Same deal. Same treatment.<p>Note likewise the oddball commented out line (assigning a tuple of m2_ci_lo_fwd, m2_ci_hi_fwd) which is disabled without explanation. Remember my list of attendant symptoms?<p>And, on the design side: note the mean/median/stdev calls.  Those are generally pretty well-defined properties of ""sets"".  Why is there a ""Metric"" postpended to the method names needlessly?  Surely the reader would understand ""st.stdev()"" already, right?  And <i>why do the methods take five named parameters?</i>.  That's insane -- they should take <i>zero</i>.  It looks like this is trying to pass in some extra ""stuff"" (maybe to control some side effects, or to filter the data) to what should be an idempotent operation on a fixed piece of data.  If you have to filter, or if the object does some extra counting or whatever, those should be set up on the data ahead of time.<p>This code is crap.  Sorry.",1364230740

Go to meetups, hang out at engineering clubs at your school, post fliers or find other appropriate means of putting it out there that you are looking for a cofounder. You don't want someone who is going to ""learn on the job"" if you want a chance at making this successful. So finding CS students at your school won't be that useful unless you can find someone who's published some web sites or apps before. Look for someone with proven ability to start AND finish projects (non-school ones).<p>Outside of school, attend meetups. Learn to code, but not to build it yourself, but to have an excuse to be around developers. That's a reason to be at meetups. There are also meetups specifically for people who are looking for cofounders.<p>You can also post online (as you did here), to find co-founders, or on things like craigslist in the jobs section.<p>Other options are to outsource on e-lance or something like that.

I don't want to go in to the details for obvious reasons, but it's been really stressful and difficult.<p>I was recruited to work as the first employee for this startup, spent a good deal of time and effort on it, and then had the founder turn around and sue me.  They're demanding more money from me than I was ever paid to begin with, because of some vague damages that I (allegedly intentionally) caused.<p>All of his claims are patently false (and I have documentation to that point), and boils down to the founder trying to scapegoat me for his own mistakes.  However, he's independently wealthy and knows that I don't have much money and likely won't be able to defend myself.  So, in essence, it feels like an adult form of bullying.<p>I have no idea what to do.  I can't afford an attorney.  I'm also concerned that there's this public mark on my record (e.g., a future employer googles me and finds this lawsuit).<p>So, what do I do?  Have any of you been in a similar place with an early-stage startup?  How do it go?  Why do people suck so much?<p>EDIT: I was apparently responding to too many questions, and am rate limited, so I can't respond anymore.<p>I am a student and I have called my student legal services.  This case is too big for them to handle.  In the words of one of the people I spoke with, ""you would have been better off getting a DWI.""<p>It is a lawsuit in federal court, not just a threatening letter.  I have considered going pro se, but I'm too concerned about following proper procedure.<p>I was W2 not 1099.  I've reviewed my employment agreements, and that's part of what makes this whole thing baseless.

Existing mockup tools are either too high-level (focusing solely on the UI and less about the functionality) or too limited (works only for a very specific type of application).

This really is the Microsoft playbook of old.  You want resistance and choice to be minimized in this case, and lock into tools and platforms due to their ease.  On the web all the libs/frameworks are really just faster ways to use web technology (HTTP/TCP/etc), where native apps have to tie into hardware and systems so you must use them so there can be only one.  There are actually lots of ways to develop for mobile beyond these frameworks though.<p>But even within these frameworks (Android, iOS) things are changed and swapped out at their will i.e. changing UIKit, Apple switching from Carbon to Cocoa, In-App Billing changing etc. So lock-in sometimes creates massive ripples of forced change.<p>If you are making cross platform apps, like the web is cross platform, that is where things get more difficult.

I've been a Spotify user since before they were in the US (using a proxy), and have been a paying customer ever since they expanded to the US.<p>To see how bad the problem is, check out the reviews for their Android app [1]. For <i>years</i> they've released update after update for Android, adding new features and breaking old ones, without addressing the #1 feature request by Android users (many of them <i>paying customers</i>): landscape mode. I've been playing Spotify in my android dock (home and car) by tilting my head 90 degrees to scroll and navigate for a long time. Makes for a fun driving experience.<p>Android users have been getting so frustrated, I've seen a few saying to the effect of, ""I'm editing my review to remove a star every time you release a new update without landscape mode."" Needless to say, there are lots of 1-star reviews. It's actually a ritual for me now. Every time they release a new update, I like to see what obscure feature they were able to think of this time (usually something like ""Added Portugese  language support"" (no offense to existing users who actually did request this)), and then go read all the new reviews from pissed off users. I'm pretty sure Spotify must have an internal bet going to see how long they can go before adding and fixing the features their existing users are actually asking for.<p>My point to all this?

Nor does it mean that if a report isn't true then the company may retaliate.<p>Yes, ""participating can nullify the inference that the jokes were unwelcome"". That is correct and you, I, and the courts are all in agreement. But you are ignoring the second part, which is that stopping participation isn't enough to indicate that the jokes are unwelcome. Someone must first complain in order to indicate that there is a change in status.<p>So it most certainly does say that if someone has a reasonable belief that dirty jokes are a form of sexual discrimination, then that person may file a report - even if that person once participated in those dirty jokes - and Title VII protections apply.<p>Using 'basic logical reasoning', if someone has a reasonable belief that dirty jokes are a form of sexual discrimination, then that person may file a report - even if that person has never participated participated in those dirty jokes - and Title VII protections apply.<p>The reason you may have difficulties is you are looking at the results of an incident where the courts have decided that a ""proliferation"" of pornography is an example of sexual harassment which is not allowed under Title VII. However, PyCon does not want to be a place where sexual harassment is allowed.<p>The Title VII reporting mechanism which end up in court are the same as the Title VII reporting mechanisms used to point out possible cases of sexual harassment in a company, so that a company might correct the situation and avoid going to court.<p>That's why there does not need to be a ""proliferation"" of sexual discrimination before people can complain about their civil rights being violated.",1364229045

5437809,comment,5435060,5436896,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">According to national trends, in 10-15 years, the problems that they are having in California are likely to become national problems until they can change their political identity. (Why do you think that the Republican leadership is trying to be soft on immigration reform?)<p>The fundamental problem the Republicans have is that they have kind of an unstable coalition. The Democrats have a lock on the urban working class. That's close to half the country by itself, so the Republicans need a majority of <i>everyone else</i> in order to win. But ""everyone else"" is not a homogenous group. It's libertarians, religious conservatives, Wall St., rural blue collar workers, small business owners, etc. And it's shrinking as a percentage of the country, largely because ""urban working class"" is growing.<p>So the problem they have is that to get more voters, they have to gore somebody's ox. There are a huge ton of libertarian-leaning Democrats who would switch parties if the Republicans would stop pandering to religious extremists on social issues, but then they risk losing the huge voting block of religious conservatives. I personally think that could be a good strategy: Just say ""screw it"" and go to the <i>left</i> of the Democrats on social issues. If the Democrats stick with liberal social positions then the religious conservatives don't have any religious conservative candidate anymore, and they're still largely pro-free market people who may continue to vote Republican. Meanwhile if you can push the Democrats to the right on social issues then all the better, because now the <i>Republicans</i> can claim the growing demographic of urban voters who want liberal social positions, to say nothing of what it would do for women voters. But that's a pretty radical change.<p>Changing their position on immigration instead makes a lot of sense, because the growing Hispanic demographic leans pro-market and religious and is mostly disgusted with Republicans for their immigration policies. The problem is the result will be to increase polarization, because it allows the Republicans to double down on ""monopolies are good + gays are bad"" while making <i>all</i> the races closer, because it allows the Republicans to gain with Hispanics in urban areas, while giving the Democrats more votes among blue collar voters in rural areas who don't like the new immigration policy. And having a larger number of contentious races with more polarization is not likely to be good for the country.",1364228208

It would be misaligned with their incentives. When Apple develops UIKit and the associated development tools, they convince developers to move to iOS. When Google develops Android, they convince developers to move to their platform. When someone makes a web framework, they convince people to move to a platform where they have no skin in the game. You don't sell more devices through convincing people to move to an open platform.<p>Further, I think the author hugely underestimates the effort that goes into designing an iOS/Android quality framework. Those frameworks go way beyond the MVC microframeworks that are the rage these days. These frameworks consist of many detailed high-quality images, gradients, sheens, and finely tuned animations. You can't just start an open source project and expect engineers to magically produce these assets in a coherent manner.

There are RFCs, but every browser has its own rules about encoding, and IE is especially problematic because it tries to second-guess your intentions at every opportunity. You can't use capability detection to solve this problem, because browsers don't execute CSS/JS when they just download files. If you really want to make it perfect for every user, you'll probably need to write a slightly different version of the download script for every browser, and several for IE 6/7/8/9/10.<p>Another valid reason for sniffing the user agent string is when you're trying to offer browser-specific instructions.

Is she a feminist? Who knows. I don't think ""not working to the detriment of women"" counts anyone as a feminist--being decent towards women should be the default state without a specific name. Her actions were more likely driven by a need to seek validation for being a good, compliant worker, in the corporate mold, as expected of her.<p>Her expectation that she would gain more attention for complaining about the absolutely minuscule sexual content of their jokes than she would for complaining about disruptive noisiness indicates a corporate culture that is so sex-negative that it cannot tolerate even the mere mention of sex. By extricating such a fundamental aspect of the human condition from the place where people spend most of their waking lives, it serves to dehumanize the worker. The message is, when you are at work, you are not a person with needs, you are a part of the corporate machine.<p>The dehumanization enables further. Why dip into record corporate profits for seniority-based raises when the worker fulfills no greater functional role to the company, regardless of inflation impacting the employee's real net worth just as much as it helps the company's valuation? And the self-policing compliance of informant systems builds a distrust between coworkers, thereby preventing attempts to collectively act against the corporation.<p>The worker is thus merely one, solitary unit, easily bullied into the most profit maximizing mold.",1364227414

5437715,comment,5436614,5437205,1,0,VLM,,,"""Maybe you both are bad at growing trees""<p>Trees are pretty easy to grow, and the posters might be good at growing trees.  The problem is there are so many kinds of tree.  More likely growing the wrong tree for the local climate and microclimate.  Being able to buy a sapling from someone who profits from people having to buy saplings doesn't necessarily prove anything about either the sapling or the environment other than you can definitely make money selling saplings.<p>If you go into the design process with a selected species before you design its environment, and then ignore its biological requirements in the environment design, its going to fail.  Ignoring the environment while planting a tree anyway, is the opposite of being truly ecological or truly green.  Looking a couple levels up at the guy with the two dead trees... just grow a different species, it'll take off like a weed unless you're in a desert or worse (grow a cactus?)<p>The existence of professional arborists proves nothing.  There's nothing wrong with trying to stretch both your own abilities and your local/micro climate abilities.  An arborist is an expensive way to get someone who knows what they're doing to have your back when you get a little too ambitious.  Growing two oak trees in front of my childhood home was a little overambitious once they got up to 100 feet or so, and an arborist (for quite a fee) trimmed the dead branches every couple years for my parents.  If you insist and have way too much money, an arborist can probably find a way to grow a palm tree in Alaska or a conifer in Dubai.  But you won't like the bill...<p>Analogy:  I want to grow and eat some edible plants.  I like bananas (whats not to love?).  I plant some bananas outside in Wisconsin.  They die in January when it never goes above freezing for three weeks.  Therefore no edible plants can or should be grown in Wisconsin, and no one else should even try, and growing edible plants in Wisconsin is just a wasteful fad that should go away.  Or maybe not, since I know personally you can eat pretty well off fresh farmers market produce... however, no bananas.",1364227267

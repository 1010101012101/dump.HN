People were gathered from the streets, from their homes and their workplaces. None were told what they were about to face, none were allowed to talk to anyone back home, and none were allowed to leave when they got there.<p>All in all, there was a handful of people who really knew the risks and who truly, heroically sacrificed themselves. Then there were some volunteers, and then there were masses of involuntary laborers who were told that they should take a few charcoal tablets a day and they&#x27;ll be fine.<p>About 600 000 people were involved in the liquidation effort. Surely you cannot believe that they were all Soviet heroes, or volunteers for a cause no one actually was told about at the time. You don&#x27;t need to hope for volunteers in a totalitarian regime if you can just gather any able-bodied man you can find.",1411498790

I&#x27;ve replaced television (of all sorts) with streamed video content and/or on-line reading.  It&#x27;s not about the delivery method it&#x27;s about spending my free time watching/reading the most entertaining content.<p>When I was little, if I hadn&#x27;t brought books and magazines home from the library, the only &quot;new&quot; content I could be entertained by the television.  New regulations on Internet content providers won&#x27;t solve the CATV viewership problem it will simply push viewers from the (newly regulated) popular content providers to other providers.

8357398,comment,8353006,8355536,2,0,tankenmate,,,"You <i>have</i> to fork, it&#x27;s the only way to make a new process. Now exactly which process does the fork()ing is, somewhat, academic. Some might argue about the band aid approach of the requirements of parenting and process groups; but that would require leaving POSIX (and hence source compatibility) behind. Allowing any process to set their own parent, process group, or controlling terminal without very strong bounds is dangerous; kind of like having Erlang with mutability, it&#x27;s possible but it breaks the model (and all the cuspyness that comes with it) and leads to bad juju.<p>Requiring init to spawn the final daemon process (and hence getting the pid from fork()) is a red herring, any process can get a list of its children and query their proc structure (modulo permissions, but most sane people run init as root).<p>init should be as small as possible to do <i>only</i> what it is required to do; this is simple anti-fragility at work. The less code and state the better. Feel free to stick your process manager, dependency calculators, and helper daemons in other processes. init should be able to handle something as catastrophic as a SEGFAULT and just execve(/sbin/init) and just carry on (while logging locally and remotely of course).",1411498774

Rules is rules.<p>Netflix quacks like a broadcaster so it falls under the rule, no? Not quite. There&#x27;s a &quot;new media&quot; exemption that says, in return for giving the CRTC, when asked, statistics on the Canadian consumers of your service, you can be exempt from that particular scrutiny.<p>Netflix was asked. Netflix didn&#x27;t give the information.<p>Now we see what the CRTC will do. It has every right to ask for an injunction from the courts to shut down Netflix&#x27;s Canadian operations.

8357394,comment,8355941,8356387,4,0,nostrademons,,,"Your first article is based on faulty economics.  When productivity increases are shared across an industry, nobody in the industry benefits.  Instead, the benefits accrue to the customers and complements of the industry.  There&#x27;s a long historical precedent for that - productivity improvements in textile manufacturing destroyed the textile industry, productivity improvements in farming destroyed the small farmer, productivity improvements in fishing destroyed the individual fisherman.<p>Applied to software, the reason engineers aren&#x27;t capturing most of that value is because <i>all</i> engineers are getting more productive.  The benefit is accruing instead to those who employ engineers and those who use & purchase software.  The exceptions are those fields where there are still significant barriers to entry and effective techniques are not widespread - isn&#x27;t this why you want to become a data scientist?<p>I might buy that we&#x27;re not in a salary bubble, but not for the reasons you propose.  Rather, I&#x27;d say that the existence of a thriving market for startup founders is a market inefficiency.  When engineers top out at $200K at a corporate job (and they don&#x27;t always...I know some engineers with multi-million-$ stock grants) but can quit their job and instantly get millions in seed funding, that indicates that salaries should rise and seed funding availability should fall to bring those options back to equilibrium.",1411498720

A big one.<p>We, as a community of innovators, need to stop these online communities of &#x27;hackers against women&#x27; from existing because their threats, like the nude leaking of emma watson photos, prevent women from being public figures, starting companies and sadly participating in a huge chunk of the internet.  Read below an excerpt from the article:<p>&quot;Those three problems — women being threatened, women being pressured to change their own behavior to avoid sexual assault, and women being told that they don&#x27;t deserve protection unless they stay pure and ladylike — are all individually terrible. But together, they add up to something even worse: a vicious cycle that pressures women out of public life. When we tell women that the threats and attacks they experience are their own fault, for failing to be sufficiently chaste or failing to take &quot;responsible&quot; precautions, we are telling them that they are on their own: that they cannot rely on society&#x27;s protection against those crimes.

Nothing you say indicates that labor was a decisive or major factor.

If you try it and encounter annoyances because it does not behave exactly like what you want, you have to hack in the code! I will never fix something myself if it does not annoy me. This does not mean that I did nothing for you, instead I tried a lot to make the code such that everybody can hack it, it is very regular, short, simple and occasionally well documented (vicmd.w, buf.c).<p>I spent a probably unreasonable amount of time thinking on its design and I believe I came up with something satisfying, the code is only 3000 lines but one or two features I want remain to be hacked in. The undo and the buffer data structures were tested automatically for several hours with success (see the tools/ subdir), no data was ever lost. The file saving command is even formally proved correct in Coq.<p>Any suggestion that could simplify the logic and preferably decrease the line count is more than welcome.<p>Also, note that the version showed in the video is a bit deprecated, the master branch now supports better handling of async commands and window splits (vertical and up to 6 windows) with resizes using the mouse.<p>Some are concerned about the license.

HN doesn&#x27;t allow that. HN titles are pointers to stories, not little op-eds, and need to neutrally reflect the story&#x27;s content as a whole.<p>HN readers can make up their own minds about what parts of an article are important. It&#x27;s not the submitter&#x27;s prerogative to do that for everybody. Being first to submit a story confers no authority over it.<p>HN&#x27;s value hierarchy starts with respect for the content and for the reader; submitters are somewhat down on the list. Sorry, but it does apply to all of us qua submitter.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing about the detail you singled out. Arguably, the article buries the lede. The place to point that out, however, is not in the title but in the comments, where there is ample opportunity to discuss the details and where the submitter is on the same footing as everyone else.<p>Edit: this discussion always comes up in the context of a title where people agree with the submitter&#x27;s rewrite and disagree with moderators&#x27; reversion to the original. But that&#x27;s not a good basis for assessing the rule. Instead, you should consider the far more common case of all the rewritten titles you <i>disagree</i> with, either because they&#x27;re flat-out wrong or because the author&#x27;s and your opinions differ. Imagine what HN would be like if it that were routinely ok. The front page would mostly be spin. HN would be more tendentious and have more kibitzing about titles than it does now. Those effects would be compounded everywhere else. It would be a very different place. The more experience I have with HN, the more I feel that pg&#x27;s decision to have it always focus neutrally on content is one of the wisest design choices he made.",1411497686

Though the message has remained the same, the means used to achieve that message have evolved drastically. Furthermore, the actual <i>truth</i> of that message has gone from hopeful fiction to practical reality.<p>Specifically, having real, large codebases written in the language (Servo and the compiler itself) as well as an ever-expanding ecosystem of libraries has allowed the developers and the community to determine what approaches work best and should be emphasized. Abstractions and tools that are little-used are torn out or redesigned, while features that play to the language&#x27;s strengths are given greater prominence. Modern Rust is actually a <i>much</i> lower-level language than pre-0.1 Rust (circa 2011), which, back then, conceptually resembled Go (via convergent evolution).<p>To answer your questions directly:<p>1. Yes, it was hype (or rather, naive optimism) in the beginning to believe that a memory-safe language could be compete with or exceed C++ in performance while also offering modern language features (without the menagerie of gotchas that accompany those features in C++). Thankfully, as the result of much iteration, it seems as though our optimism was not unfounded, and that such things really are possible.<p>2. You don&#x27;t need to trust it now. The community is exploding all on its own, and I suspect that its growth is still limited by the fact that we&#x27;re pre-1.0. Once the stable 1.0 release hits and a dependable library ecosystem coalesces, <i>then</i> evaluate the language and those using it to determine whether or not it&#x27;s a language worth placing your trust in.

Sometimes I&#x27;d pick a random vegetable that I didn&#x27;t know the name of, then take it home, figure out what it is called, check the indexes of a couple paper cookbooks, google it, see the types of things people make with it, and then throw out all that research and just try cutting it into cubes and baking it in a shallow pan with other veggies I&#x27;m more familiar with. :)<p>Turnips, parsnips, rutabaga!<p>Radishes, beets!  A dozen types of kale.  All the brassicas.  Heirloom tomatoes (the flavors vary a great deal).<p>Most of these things are harder to prepare than the contemporary American Standard veggies: tomatoes (two types), broccoli, lettuce (two types), peppers (three or four colors), cauliflower, carrots, etc.  And they all have richer flavors.<p>Personally I think that mustard greens make a great lettuce replacement for a burger.  Just rip the stems out first if you find this too ... chewy.<p>I also slow cook different hunks of meat with veggies and different curries.  I visited an eastern grocery of some kind a while back and took advantage of their promotional pricing on curries.  With the types I got, it seems that you&#x27;re suppose to COOK with the stuff, rather than adorn what you cook.  I&#x27;ll put half a cup of cinnamon-based curry into a slowcooker with a pork roast and some hours later I have heaven in that pot, heaven that falls apart when you put a fork to it.<p>Oh, bread machines are awesome.  I&#x27;ve only made a couple of loafs so far...  Super easy.<p>Speaking of bread, industrial-scale bread is terrible.  It turns into dense material in your gut.  Get some bread that isn&#x27;t completely homogenous--if it&#x27;s too hard for you, try warming it or moistening it.  Soak it in butter, or milk, or soup.  (Don&#x27;t those things sound sort of familiar?)<p>> 4. Do you follow any diet? Atkins, Slow Carb etc.<p>Wut?  I like butter.  And bacon.  Does that count?  Wait, I also like my butter on bread, and bacon in my salads.<p>> 5. Do you have any life hacks, tips to be more productive as a cook?<p>Remember: cooking is older than the internet.  It&#x27;s older than your favorite economic system.<p>The recipes that have survived across time are not just tasty, they are also easy and cheap (but maybe not quick).  The food species that have survived across time are themselves tasty, easy, and cheap.  For both, you might need some knowledge to utilize them...  And you&#x27;ll certainly screw up a few times.  But, you can be sure that people with less resources (perhaps including mental resources) successfully ate these things--keep at it and you&#x27;ll not just catch up to your predecessors, you&#x27;ll exceed them.<p>If you are the sort of person who carefully peels garlic, try this tactic whenever you encounter some hard or annoying work in the kitchen: ask yourself, what would a cave person do?  Yeah, the husks just fall off when you smash the garlic.  The same is true for a variety of veggies.  I also find that for some leafy greens, ripping them produces better results than cutting them.<p>I&#x27;ve said a lot about OLD things.  Before someone associates me with that whole paleo diet thing, let me point out that I&#x27;m not following a fad, I&#x27;m following my stomach and common sense.  I&#x27;m also an emacs user. :)<p>ALWAYS wash your greens as if you&#x27;d just submerged them in a muddy rain puddle--get into the nooks and crannies with running water and your fingers.  It&#x27;s not just about the E coli, it&#x27;s also about the actual mud and grit.  Plants come from dirt!",1411497545

I like that there&#x27;s a science behind it, and I like that if you become any good, your standard-of-living (of eating?) will be vastly improved.<p>Tip #1: get a good knife. If you can, go to a store that&#x27;ll let you actually hold a knife prior to purchase, to test its heft and balance. Find one that fits you comfortably. (I like Shun knives, but this is a pretty personal topic; don&#x27;t let that be my personal endorsement so much as my personal choice.) The knife should be sharp, and you should keep it honed with a honing steel. Eventually it may get dull to the point where you might want a whetstone to sharpen it again, but you&#x27;d probably need to use your knife a decent amount before it gets to that point.<p>Tip #2: mis-en-place, which is French for, basically, putting things into place. Your mis is your work station. Clean your counters. Get out your cutting board. Have a bowl for food waste (e.g. the ends you cut off a carrot, the skin off a potato that you peel) and somewhere to put food once you have finished whatever you are doing.<p>Tip #3: prep work will make your life much, much easier. If the dish calls for diced onions, then you should dice your onions before you turn the heat on the stove. Having all of the vegetables chopped, things marinated, meat salted and spiced, whatever -- ahead of time -- will make the act of cooking about ten times less stressful than otherwise.<p>Tip #4: taste your food. Needs some salt? Add salt. Maybe some pepper will make it pop. This is a hard thing to quantify; how things taste and what you think you will need is partly your palate, which you can develop beyond what it is now, but some stuff (salt makes things taste better -- to a point, beyond which it just makes things taste like salt) is universal. Just don&#x27;t be afraid to try some things, in small measures at least, and taste it to see where it&#x27;s at.",1411497109

I really like good food, but don&#x27;t always want to pay restaurant prices for it. There&#x27;s a certain satisfaction in creating something delicious. It&#x27;s sometimes a struggle between making time to cook at home and wanting to be lazy and just go out, though.<p>2. Not as much as we should. My wife prefers to plan ahead, but I&#x27;m not so good at always sticking to it.<p>3. We&#x27;re pretty eclectic in what we cook. I enjoy Asian inspired flavors and have been intending to make more curries.<p>4. Not really. I have a certain affinity toward paleo, but I don&#x27;t follow it too consistently. Mostly when I&#x27;m cooking I just try to eat &quot;clean&quot; without a lot of processed junk in it. I&#x27;d like to start baking my own bread again so I know what goes into it.<p>5. Several. Learn to use a knife, and keep it sharp. Get the biggest cutting board you can find. Season everything. Taste frequently, when practical (good with soups and sauces, not good with raw chicken ;)). Use a rice cooker, it&#x27;s set and forget and keeps a burner (and pan) open for other things. If you have stainless steel pans, learn to use them correctly. To make it easier to slice meat thinly, put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes first. Clean as you go. Don&#x27;t be afraid to fail.<p>If you need something relatively fast and hands off, oven-roasted veggies and protein (particularly chicken, pork, and fish) work really well, and are much healthier than eating out.<p>Seriously, I can&#x27;t overemphasize &quot;keep it sharp&quot; when it comes to knives. It&#x27;s not just easier, it&#x27;s also much safer. Dull knives are prone to turning and cutting things you didn&#x27;t want cut, such as your fingers.",1411496790

There are several factors you&#x27;re neglecting to consider here.<p>The salaries listed here are in our highest cost of living areas. The vast majority of developers aren&#x27;t earning anywhere near these wages. Most are in the $50,000-$90,000 range (not too far off of your EUR$35k - $50k figures). Second, I think you&#x27;re discounting far too heavily how much extra the average American has to contribute on his own for his own health and retirement. One might consider the 15%-20% one should take out of his pre-tax salary for savings to be an implicit tax we have to pay. The federal marginal rate for an individual earning $130k/yr is around 30% (for the sake of argument--it&#x27;s actually a bit higher). In SF and NY, the state taxes wll boost that 8%-10% (or more). So the base tax rate is already around 40%. Couple that with this implicit tax, and Americans are paying a &quot;tax&quot; that is about what Europeans pay. Except we get a lot less for it by a long, long way. And, actually, since it&#x27;s infreqent to earn that much money as a software developer without having a college degree, there is the additional factor of the cost of our education. Most people can&#x27;t afford the 15%-20% hit to their pay because of the high cost of everything else, so the &#x27;add-on&#x27; cost that hits them in retirement is even worse.",1411496132

In particular look at the year the book/tutorial/etc. was written and try to get stuff that was written or updated recently.  Both languages have been around for many years and evolved quite a bit.  Advice about how to use C++ in 1990 is vastly different than how to use it in 2014 with modern C++ versions.<p>Also read some reviews of the book before you spend any time reading it.  The mid 90&#x27;s were a really bad time for C++ in my opinion since it was kind of a new language and being pushed heavily as the default &#x27;learn computer programming&#x27; language (which Java later usurped).  This means there are tons of very badly written and confusing resources that do more harm trying to teach C++ than actual good.

Her books are amazing too.<p>Buy a few standard cookbooks. I love Joy Of Cooking because it&#x27;s practically a canonical reference to make anything, and there&#x27;s lots of info on technique. There are a few Culinary school books that are really good too (the ICC book &quot;Fundamental Techniques of Classical Cooking&quot; and the CIA &quot;The Professional Chef&quot; are good).<p>Practice, Practice, Practice. Make certain dishes because you want to get good at a technique or skill.<p>On general recipes: Don&#x27;t make too many dishes because they were on a blog, sound good, or use a trendy ingredient (beer, bourbon, kale, bacon). Often they are overly complicated and they aren&#x27;t very diverse. Don&#x27;t underestimate how delicious basic dishes can be. Don&#x27;t underestimate how many techniques and skills from classical french cuisine apply to cultures everywhere, and importantly, the ingredients are almost always available.

At the extreme end of this, I do a christmas meal for 20+ friends every year, generally involving turkey, beef, ham, two types of potatoes, sprouts, a bunch of veg, home made sauces, christmas puddings, etc. This is great fun, but I need to start planning in October (note to self - remember to start planning that soon).<p>3.

That will be sixteen times the density of Virginia. And that is the best case scenario.",1411495429

I cook for myself most of the time, which makes this approach work...if I mess up on a new improvised recipe, I just have a less-than-perfect dinner. Then, when I&#x27;m cooking for friends, I&#x27;ll whip out a home grown recipe that I&#x27;ve made enough times to trust.<p>I&#x27;ve found paper cookbooks preferable to apps, because I can spill stuff on them, burn them, use them with wet hands, set stuff down on them, and they don&#x27;t turn off. I have a couple of cookbooks with simple, staple recipes that I use for reference, but I&#x27;ve also found The Flavor Bible(1) to be incredibly useful—it basically works as a big index of ingredient affinities, so you can look up flavors that go well together for a huge variety of ingredients.<p>I keep my kitchen stocked with a lot of basics, but I live right near a grocery store, so I&#x27;ll drop by after work if I need anything special.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Flavor-Bible-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Flavor-Bible-Creativity-Imaginativ...</a>",1411495365

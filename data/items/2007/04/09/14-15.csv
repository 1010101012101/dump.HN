The only people afraid of Microsoft is the Microsoft Haters out there who for some obscure reason, can't think much about anything except bashing MSoft<p>If any of you knew anything about the software business, you would know that almost all the drive for making your product a great product is so M$oft will buy you out. Again for some silly reason a lot of the haters believe that all companies other than M$Soft are fair, reasonable and above board and that sure ain't true. Name me one company that M$oft took over than didn't make the owner a millionaire.<p>Lets get real and realize that consumer's opinion is not worth zippo to all these companies.\n",1176130575

At some point you have to filter them out and trust that the people who are able to understand have understood and move on.",1176129109

10788,comment,10667,10674,0,0,python_kiss,,,"""..Even when you find genuinely good things to copy, there's another pitfall to be avoided. Be careful to copy what makes them good, rather than their flaws. It's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws, because they're easier to see, and of course easier to copy too. For example, most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors. They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance, whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt. Those paintings have since been cleaned, revealing brilliant colors; their imitators are of course still brown."" - Copy What You Like, by Paul Graham",1176127360

78538,comment,78472,78505,0,0,qaexl,,,"To add to this, there's several different kinds of mediation. The one you're looking for helps you relax your body in a way that doesn't fuzz your mind, or burns up your focus. <p>Some of the meditation methods overlap with deep breathing. You breath deeply by expanding both the bottom of the lungs, the sides of the lungs, and the top of the lungs. You make sure the bottom ribs are expanding. You don't try to force the expansion to the point where you're trying to hold air in like a puffed up balloon, greedy for more. <p>You cannot force yourself to relax. Consciously relaxing requires you to relinquish control over the muscles that are tensing up while still observing it.<p>In your case, I would also work on clenching and then relaxing your toes. There's connective and control tissues going from your feet to the jaws and temples. <p>If you're going to learn how to do this though, you'll need to set aside definite time where the startup cannot intrude. Supposing you set an alarm clock to buzz in fifteen minutes, then within the fifteen minutes of meditation/relaxation, you must allow all of the concerns, worries, thoughts, obsession, guilt with the startup to drift away. Otherwise, this won't work very well. There are people who develop superlative levels of skill in relaxation and meditation; these folks spend as much time and energy dedicated to it as you would to a startup ... so the least you can do is respect it during the fifteen minutes you are cultivating calmness.

78524,comment,78409,78409,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I felt parts of me resonate with the Nerd Stereotype. It made me laugh. <p>There is a good description of a personality requirement I found on this blog (<a href=""http://blog.boxee.tv/2007/08/08/wanted-a-code-poet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.boxee.tv/2007/08/08/wanted-a-code-poet/</a>) for a programming job in Israel typifying the stereotype:<p>""someone that can write PHP with two hands tied behind his back, but dreams in C++.<p>favorite beach book reading: design patterns (hard cover edition, signed by the authors)<p>favorite debate topic: LAMP vs. J2EE (prefers LAMP, but can argue both sides of the issue)<p>favorite animal: penguin.<p>hobbies: none.<p>(social skills are not a requirement)<p>if you think you fit the bill please send us an email (don't forget to mention your favorite compilation flags for the Linux kernel).""<p>
Obviously they're trying to find someone of the stereotype - they'd be the best for that job. I laugh at my Nerd side, it's only just the beginning of personality development. ",1194826619

On the other hand, when I do turn it on, it will apply retroactively.  <p>As for the question of what effect this story has, that depends on what the editors think. Probably they'd be split on it.  This is arguably an Internet story as much as a political one.",1194826518

The only time I'd be nervous is if I had nothing to say. I love sharing the things I find interesting with other people, so after you get started it comes very naturally and you can just be yourself.",1194826464

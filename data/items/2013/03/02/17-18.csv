5310273,comment,5308611,5309075,2,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""The point is that those who want to study art will study art.""</i><p>In another post of yours, elsewhere in the thread[1], you yourself pointed out that:<p><i>""when I was a kid I wanted to be a poet. Poems wouldn't keep a roof over my head and hell, at the time, neither would code. Hasn't stopped me from writing poems in my spare time and engaging in my other pursuits. If ever a time comes when one could sustainably make money selling art, then I'm sure many artists and even non artists will flood the market.""</i><p>Presumably, you didn't study poetry.  Not because you didn't want to, but because you didn't think it was economically viable.  Many if not most people interested in art are in the same boat.  On top of that, there's the stigma associated with art and artists that influences their own attitudes and decisions of whether or not to pursue or study art.<p>So, no.  I don't think that ""those who want to study art will study art"".  Most who do want to choose not to.  It's a minority who are wealthy enough, driven enough, or naive enough (with tolerant enough parents) who do actually study art.<p><i>""Again, I'm going to have to ask you to be specific with your definition of the ""creative arts"" because it seems your gripe is that we are teaching kids math instead of drawing in school;""</i><p>Drawing is, in fact, one of the so-called ""creative arts"".  So is painting, sculpture, printmaking, creative writing, music, theater, and dance.  Architecture, illustration, and graphic design could arguably be squeezed in to that definition as well.  History, English, and various other ""humanities"" subjects would not.  Though creativity is required in many if not most fields of human endeavour (including math), that does not make them part of the ""creative arts"".<p><i>""to which of course the appropriate response is school is for learning, not for doodling.""</i><p>Now that's a condescending view of art and its role in education if I've ever heard one.  I'm sure you would not enjoy hearing math described in a similarly condescending way.<p><i>""Just like you should have a certain level of reading capacity, you should also have a certain level of reasoning capacity. This is the bare minimum one should have. So if your gripe is about the amount of math taught, well, I hope you take that same gripe with history, literature, geography, and even PE.""</i><p>I do have the same gripe against all those other subjects, which are certainly looked upon as more ""serious"" than art, and are generally given more resources and emphasis in the education system (well, except maybe for geography).  Art is unjustly demeaned and underappreciated.  That's not to say that these other subjects are also underappreciated compared to the moneymaking and ""practical"" fields.  They are.<p><i>""Now is when it is most painfully obvious that he who understands the world holds the power. It used to be he who holds the purse strings, but thanks to the litany of these technologies that we're talking about, it's becoming less so (though not fast enough).""</i><p>But we're not talking about what used to be (though your depiction of math as being neglected in the past relative to art could also be argued -- I don't know when in history the ""creative arts"" as I defined above were ever near as popular in education as math was).  We're talking about now.<p><i>""The important questions in the world are/have been/ are being asked, and not many of them involve ""self-expression"".""</i><p>Well, this is indeed an expression of bias that could be corrected through better education.<p>Unfortunately, your attitude of condescension towards other fields is not limited to math/physics folks.  It's all too prevalent in most fields.  Many people who are passionate about their own field are often disparaging of others (especially ones radically different from their own).  I think this is generally due to ignorance and lack of appreciation of the worth and value of other fields.<p>Of course, that doesn't mean that every field is necessarily equally valuable.  But perhaps every (or nearly every) field has something of value in it, perhaps even of great value.  Until this is appreciated on a deep level, I'm afraid we're going to continue to have the kind of bickering over which field is most valuable and which should get more dollars and emphasis in education that we have now, and there'll continue to be a stigma on certain fields.<p><i>""Knowledge of Science and Math add a whole new dimension to our exploration of the world and people are just taking notice. That is the point. The journey that STEM has made from esoterica to becoming a full participant in the cultural discussion. The idea that we can even consider STEM a cultural activity.""</i><p>Wonderful.  I'm all for that.<p><i>""Smashing that barrier that keeps people assuming that STEM people are these little weird people with their irrelevant subjects and threats to human existence and starting to see it as a part of the human experience like any other.""</i><p>A part of the human experience like any other.  Like art.  Which also has deep value to the human experience.<p>If you don't agree, I'll just refer you to Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, DaVinci, Van Gogh, and Michaelangelo.  Their like are not exactly encouraged by cutting arts funding in favor of math, nor by stigmatizing the creation of art as ""doodling"" or whatever other derrogatory terms you wish to use.<p><i>""I'm sure you're very passionate about art, and in a perfect world, we would all have the things we love be recognized both culturally and economically. But antagonizing an entire field just because one's field isn't getting the limelight is not a productive way to go.""</i><p>Pot, meet kettle.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5308873"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5308873</a>",1362246376

Maybe it doesn't work with the message surrounding it (does that even make sense?).  I have no idea how to judge that.  How do I know who does?<p>For the coding analogue, I don't think it's ""pretty/beautiful"" code (except by proxy).  Suppose I write something for you that shows off the art that you want to sell.  This is a unique app to you (let's say)- Your plan is to generate traffic by blogging about art, and have your stuff tactically displayed throughout to prompt people to buy it.  I build the app, you click on it and it works exactly the way you think it should.<p>Now, you take the app, integrate it into your site, and stick on adwords because you need to make some short-term cash while you iterate your long-term strategy.  But my coding sucks, and my script doesn't play well with adwords, and your site fails in a way that you can't see- perhaps you don't get the credit for the clicks you actually generate.<p>Mind you, I'm not claiming to have answers (I wish I did).  But it may be helpful to compare and contrast the plight of artists with that of other professions that are self-identified.  When I was growing up, car mechanics were among those professions also.  What creates distinction?<p>Maybe there are two types of distinction to consider:  professional prestige and financial success.

5310238,comment,5309366,5309788,1,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Referral links in book reviews are a problem because of the conflict of interest they create. If the author of the review chooses to put a referral link into it, they create a financial incentive to bias their own review in favour of the book.</i><p>OK, some of my observations on the whole issue of reviews and criticism here:<p>1) Are referrals that different than the publisher advertising on the newspaper or magazine that reviews his books? Or if the author is a friend of stuff in the magazine, or even the reviewer? All the above have been going on for ages in the publishing world.<p>2) What about a site or blog that ALWAYS puts referral links to the books it reviews, whether the reviews are favorable or not?<p>3) What about a site that only posts about books they really like, along with referrals, and skip the ones they don't?<p>4) I think the presence of referrals and quality of the review are orthogonal. Not in the sense that a referral doesn't give a ""conflict of interest"" to the reviewer, but in the sense that you shouldn't judge good reviews by the presence potential conflicts of interests or not anyway.<p>5) There is only two ways to know if a review is any good.<p>The absolute way: read the book yourself and compare to the review.<p>The faux-bayesian heuristic way: the critic has a consistent track record in his other reviews that tells you that he is good and honest.<p>6) That said, I think there is also another way. If you read enough reviews, you get the ability to judge the review itself in a meta-level. So much, that you can get useful information about the work reviewed out of it, regardless if the critic is good/honest or not. And I think this meta-reading of reviews is the more important skill. Never trust the review completely, judge it and take the information that you need by also reading behind the lines.<p>A simplistic example: maybe a review of a programming book is horrible (and paid by the publisher) but it gives code examples used in the book. Just looking at the example code you can tell with some certainty if the book itself will be a disappointment or not.",1362245770

5310119,comment,5309378,5310033,2,0,networked,,,"It does contradict the claim that ""Linux users will not pay for software"" directly.<p>You also have to note that while Windows users are more likely to own the games prior to any given Humble Bundle sale (esp. given that many games were first ported to Linux specifically for a Bundle) at the time of the sale they are unlikely to find a better deal on any of the games either separately or as a package, even games unlocked for beating the average payment. That would make buying those games from the Bundle a rational choice if you are a Windows user and want even one of them.<p>Of course, the above argument doesn't negates the fact that Windows gamers have more choice. For them the opportunity cost of paying more for a HIB could be not buying another game on Steam, GOG or elsewhere.<p>I guess in the end it all hinges on how much the buyers (all of them: Windows, Linux and Mac users) are interested in playing those games specifically vs. playing any games at all. If they are interested specifically in the titles sold, then yes, the statistics would mean that Linux users are more generous. Otherwise it's probably more about opportunity cost.",1362243921

Printouts and the like generally get forgotten a few minutes after they were printed. Whenever I need to map out an idea within a script/program I'm working on I usually turn to my good ol' number two pencil and a couple sheets of paper and map out the basics of what I need to do, why I need to do it and any similar links.<p>I find that this allows me to clarify things greatly, even the simple act of sitting for a moment and mapping things out. Pretty much I have found that without fail this leads to better outcomes with scripting for me and things just flow better.<p>I'm not saying this will necessarily work for you, but for myself at least, writing certainly clarifies and brings into focus programming tasks.<p>Also, getting into the whole bit with reading from LCD screens when reading from them, the material I read on LCD I find that it is remembered less clearly than when it is on paper (be it a book or, notes, etc.).

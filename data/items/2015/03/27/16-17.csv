That immigration is disproportionately undereducated, rural farmers.A thriving middle class has tended stay in Mexico.<p>Actually, lots of Mexicans have complained about the enormous brain drain of the Mexican middle class into the USA; while undereducated rural farmers may be disproportionately represented in <i>illegal</i> immigration from the US to Mexico, <i>legal</i> immigration (which is, even considering the not-inconsiderable expenses that often associated with illegal immigration, in practice as I understand it more resource intensive) from the US to Mexico (and some of the illegal immigration, as well) is educated professionals, especially those with family in the US, moving here because the pay they can get even taking a big step <i>down</i> in prestige compared to the positions they are qualified for in Mexico is enough to not only live better in the US <i>even accounting for the higher cost of living</i>, but <i>also</i> provide surplus after that to improve quality of life for a lot of their family living in Mexico (plus, give more of their family the opportunity to eventually legally immigrate to the US, through family-based immigration visas.)<p>The uneducated, rural farmers get more attention in US media coverage of immigration, perhaps because they are overrepresented among illegal immigrants (which is usually the focus of media coverage), and perhaps because they are better fodder for emotional images (<i>both</i> those seeking to provoke sympathy for the poor <i>and</i> those seeking to provoke fear of the unwashed masses).",1427475557

I know my compiler well enough to use it to build my programs in the various configurations I need.<p>Aren&#x27;t these somewhat different details to know tho, compared to knowing the insides of git?  Knowing the commands, and options available in an editor is familiarity with an interface.  You don&#x27;t need to know exactly how it stores the buffer so it can stay responsive with large files, you don&#x27;t need to know the rendering algorithms involved, etc. etc.  Just the same, I don&#x27;t think being able to use a compiler effectively depends on knowing how it does register allocation, or knowing if the parser is LALR or recursive descent.<p>These are all implementation details.  Good interfaces generally abstract over them, and present the user with what they need to use it.  Version control being necessary doesn&#x27;t change how people should approach learning it.

Different styles are completely different vocabularies that require different dexterity to be effective.

Im not particularly good at any one instrument nor do I feel Im an expert to speak on any instrument but if I had to rank the instruments I can play in order of difficulty I would say:<p>1) piano - playing chords in a rhythm is not hard, separating your hands can be tough and playing classical can be infinitely difficult.\n2) drums - I am not a natural drummer, so staying on rhythm and fills and different styles was a hard won battle for me. I think that some people are born with this ability so drums may seem simple to them.\n3) guitar - probably the easiest instrument to compose a full song with, and its somewhat easy to vary from chords to leads and back. I think that anyone with 6 months and some determination can be a &quot;competent&quot; guitarist or at least get over the learning curve.\n4) bass - I think this is easiest because you have the choice to relegate yourself to the rhythm section and just play a groove.<p>Im sure that others may feel differently, and I don&#x27;t think there is a right answer.

There is no shame in that. But finally admitting fault after months of intransigence (I&#x27;m taking about from the launch of the book, when people first started criticising it, until that thread) doesn&#x27;t excuse your behaviour prior to that. With a bit more humility from the beginning none of this would have happened. If you are going to pick a fight with people, C language lawyers are probably about the worst target.<p>I don&#x27;t care about &quot;winning&quot; the argument - just about everybody already agreed that C is highly unsafe, and personally I think K&R is quite outdated now, since it doesn&#x27;t dwell as much as it should on all the dangerous and difficult aspects of C. Much like C itself, it generally assumes superhuman competence on the part of the reader.<p>Putting that aside, I do think we are lacking in resources that teach people about the many pitfalls of C in one place (if only to scare people away from the idea of using C for anything network facing). Especially in an era when a lot of people learning C are probably already familiar with the basic syntax and control flow, through knowledge of Java or other languages, and will thus probably be tempted to skim through beginner C books. People coming from that direction probably find C deceptively familiar, and aren&#x27;t aware of a bunch of things like the undefined behaviour of certain integer overflows and shifts, or the strict aliasing rules, or possibly even reading uninitialized variables.<p>John Regehr has a lot of good blog posts on this topic:<p><a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1054</a><p><a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1136"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1136</a><p><a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/959</a><p>As you can see in some of those examples UB can be very difficult to spot, even for experts like compiler engineers or crypto developers who are intimately familiar with the rules. Also some things are just plain tricky to do correctly and efficiently (e.g. <a href=""http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063</a>) and in the past compilers were much less aggressive about optimisations that affected code containing undefined behaviour. So you could get away with it, and incorrect code became the accepted way to do some things. This resulted in a lot of gnashing of teeth and a few well known security vulns when old code started to break with newer compilers.<p>If you are looking to catch bugs and undefined behaviour in test cases you should certainly look into the -fsanitize options in clang.

So let&#x27;s catalog your claims in that light:<p>1. &quot;no use of context managers when working with files&quot; - I teach files early on, before they even know how to make a block.  After my book they can easily learn this.<p>2. &quot;no use of format when working with text formatting and output&quot; - Which format?  At the time I was writing this there were what seemed like 10 changes to it and how it worked.  The % format syntax works all the time, and it&#x27;s something found everywhere.  Learning it is useful, <i>and</i> doesn&#x27;t prevent them from using format later.<p>3. &quot;Avoid any project that mentions &quot;Python 3&quot;&quot; - They should, Python 3 is not ready and is simply frustrating.  Python 2 is on all of their computers already for many people, so that&#x27;s the better one for a beginner.  Also after learning 2, they can learn 3 if they need, but if they learn 3, they have to learn 2.<p>3. &quot;Every if-statement must have an else&quot; - This is for training their ability to think of the entire set of possible boolean results in an if-statement.  It&#x27;s <i>also</i> the cause of many logic bugs and you should consider it as a good way to check your own logic constructs.<p>4. &quot;no list|dict|generator|set comprehensions.&quot; - The book is for beginners who can&#x27;t even figure out how to run a python script on their own.  You think they&#x27;ll get comprehensions?  That&#x27;s insane.  Later they can easily learn this, and I think a theme in your comments is that you think once someone reads one book they are done learning, which is a bizarre idea.<p>5. &quot;no idiomatic hints&quot; - Which idiom would that be? The early Python that&#x27;s like JavaWithCamelCase or the new Python that&#x27;s like c_with_underscores? The problem with Python idioms is they warp fairly regularly depending on what&#x27;s in vogue at the time, so I just teach the simplest thing that seems to be common among all of them.  And again, they will whatever &quot;idiom&quot; you think is important later when someone like you who thinks they&#x27;re important yells at them about it.  Brains are not made of stone.<p>6. &quot;no gotchas.&quot; -- The book has loads of gotchas, <i>AND</i> I have videos that go with it where I show people the gotchas, <i>AND</i> there&#x27;s additional problems for them to solve at the end of every exercise, <i>AND</i> I encourage them to break their scripts to see how Python gives them errors.<p>You would do well to ditch the idea that people cannot relearn things.  Maybe this is holding you back as well, and it&#x27;s simply false.  Heroin and smoking are &quot;bad habits&quot;.  Playing a guitar scale wrong is a &quot;bad habit&quot;.

The Safe Harbour scheme is what makes it lawful for European businesses to use US services to process personal data about their customers. Without Safe Harbour, any European business that did this without explicit consent from users would be at risk of legal action under the usual data protection legislation. A few activist lawsuits and/or formal action by national data protection regulators would make things like using US-based SaaS or processing payments with services like Stripe a complete no-no. It would also put multinationals with any US element, such as Google and Microsoft, in a difficult position, because even if their formal in-house policy is to keep all such data exclusively within the EEA, EU data protection laws can then conflict with US disclosure requirements.<p>The article makes it seem like this is a new concern, but in reality this has been on the radar of European businesses concerned about privacy and personal data since <i>at least</i> the initial Snowden revelations that rendered the polite assumption that US companies could actually meet their obligations under Safe Harbour no longer credible. Everyone is just hoping that the obvious economic damage from preventing this kind of trade will be so dangerous that either the US government will back down (highly unlikely) or the European authorities will cave and pragmatically overlook obviously illegal (and rightly so, if you&#x27;re on the privacy side of the debate) data sharing.<p>Note that there is no general exception to the European data protection rules permitting disclosure of personal data outside the EEA upon request by foreign authorities under their own laws[1]. Specific international agreements have been created to cover specific cases like PNRs for people travelling abroad. So arguing that the US Safe Harbour scheme is still OK because it&#x27;s only the US government breaking the rules for its own official purposes has no weight in EU law.<p>[1] <a href=""https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-8-international/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protectio...</a>",1427472486

That was just a jokey comment about how angry I was about the Chinese govt.<p>As one of the billion people who live inside the Intranet &quot;protected&quot; by the GFW, I guess I can say I&#x27;m quite aware about how and why this happened. Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.<p>For those who host things Chinese govt doesn&#x27;t like, it usually just block the website altogether (Twitter, FB, and recently Google). But it had tried to block Github, twice. Each time there is a <i>huge</i> response from the Chinese webizens (mainly programmers) calling to unblock it.<p>Another way to block certain content from a website is to filter by keyword (like Wikipedia). But GH is encrypted so that&#x27;s a no. The govt even tried to use some fake SSL certificates to MITM it. So some &quot;smart&quot; guys exploited this feature and created the repo greatfire/wiki and things like this.<p>Then some evil guys from GFW thought of this way, directing the attack at these user accounts, to warn GH to remove these accounts.<p>What I don&#x27;t agree with you is the word &quot;reasonable&quot; (and the &quot;no&quot;). First, it&#x27;s <i>never</i> &quot;reasonable&quot; to DDoS attack a website. Second, if you can&#x27;t block the content, you have a choice to block the website and take the bitter from every single webizen against you. Finally, I believe it&#x27;s the website owner&#x27;s choice to choose who / what they want to use their website. Since GH is a U.S. company (I guess), it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to listen to a sh*t from the Chinese govt.",1427472142

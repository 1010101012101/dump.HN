1347091,comment,1346916,1346916,0,0,quant18,,,"The whole ""once I land in a foreign country I'm going to stop speaking my native language"" advice is only applicable to people with very specific personality types and life situations. To the rest of us, it's not inspirational, it's demoralising to the extent that many people living abroad simply never acquire any good command of their host society's language. You can easily find American bankers in Shanghai who speak poor Chinese, or Korean shopowners in Sydney who speak poor English, or whatever. And you can deride them as lazy immigrants who refuse to assimilate, or arrogant expats who are only there because they failed in New York, or whatever. Or you can try to help them.<p>The best advice I ever heard for learning foreign languages is: treat your brain the way it likes to be treated. This doesn't mean being lazy, but it does mean not putting yourself in situations that go against your personality type. And it means using learning methods that don't continually expose you to a sense of failure you hate feeling. Because otherwise your brain will just hate you later for putting it under stress, and take revenge by shutting down.<p>That means you give yourself the kind of intellectual, social, or physical stimulation that you need to feel happy during the time that you <i>do</i> devote to your target language, and ignore the people who think you are ""stupid"" for doing this. Read a book in your native language, talk with people in your mother tongue, eat food from your homeland every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is doubly important if you are learning your target language not because you LOVE LANGUAGES (like 100% of people who write language learning blogs) but because you need it for specific purposes.<p>And finally, if you are the kind of person who is very sensitive to embarassment, then you do not have an ""inhibition"" to be ""overcome"", you have an extremely good system for detecting when you are violating social norms --- and knowing social norms is just as important as conjugations & vocabulary. No one wants to communicate with a guy who is fluent in their language but rude and uncouth by their cultural standards. Don't deliberately try to suppress your embarassment just so you can get 10 minutes of horrid conversation practise with the impatient cashier at your local supermarket while the line builds up behind you.",1273836926

(I recall seeing one study where a group of students who learned Esperanto for one year and then French for three years ended up knowing French better than a group of students who studied French exclusively for four years straight.  Not conclusive by any means, but suggestive.)<p>By eliminating the complicated grammatical idiosyncrasies of natural languages, someone learning Esperanto can focus on learning how to learn a foreign language.  If you've never learned a second language before, it's easy to memorize vocabulary and obscure grammatical rules, but it's extremely hard to make the transition from reading prose word-by-word to reading it fluently.",1273836055

End of story.<p>Almost every sport is like that.  Sabermetrics was an attempt to find an optimal set of players using statistics.  That will never work in the NBA (you could certainly argue that it hasn't worked in the MLB, either).<p>Baseball is ultimately broken down into a series of 1-on-1 match-ups.  A pitcher vs. a hitter, with a defense behind them.  It's a team sport but the largest functions of the game are 1-on-1.  No other major professional sport is like that.  As such, major Sabermetrics stats like OPS and WHIP don't translate to basketball.  You get something like Hollinger's PER rating, which is meaningful but not really telling.<p>Scoring is largely out of context.  A good player may score 20 points a game on a bad team and only 10 on a great team.  Matchups change throughout the game and what your team does has a huge effect on what you do.<p>In baseball, it's much more realistic to look at the statistics of a handful of players and figure out how you should organize your team.  In basketball, crafting game plan strategies and rosters is still more of an art than a science.",1273835856

I meant 90 days for programming languages. In my experience with foreign languages, first you struggle for a while and one day it unexpectedly ""kicks in"", suddenly you're able to comfortably use the language albeit not perfectly yet while the week before you was struggling to form simpler non-trivial sentences. Depending on your experience with foreign languages and the time you spend on learning the language, this can take from half a year to several years.",1273835641

I would guess that the people from 2 year degrees spend a lot of their time actually programming, whereas those with the 4 year CS spend a lot of their time learning about computer science.<p>At MIT and there is really only one software design class you need to take for a CS degree.  It is expected that to learn to program you need to do it by hacking around on your own or working at software companies during the summer.<p>I've found that there is a significant group of CS majors at MIT (myself included) that are more interested in the cool things that can come out of theory (and eventually programming those things) than in programming itself.<p>I would be bored out of my mind gluing libraries together to write a chat program, for example.  While I find the process of designing/building/tinkering with <i>anything</i> exciting and fun, I am simply not that interested in chat programs.  I'm not even that interested in computers! To me, the freedom to explore my interests related to computing and computer science, without being pigeonholed into a ""standard"" computer science curriculum is fantastic.<p>Hence, I've spent more of my time learning about interesting topics in computer science and math than I've actually spent coding.  And I've spent even less time designing software (as opposed to just coding on various simulations/algorithms/mini-projects).<p>To echo what someone else said, yes, genuine hackers my age will probably code circles around me when it comes to programming.  But we're probably not even interested in the same kinds of jobs.<p>I am not saying software engineering is not important -- it's simply taking me longer to become competent at it (or at least ""employable"") because I'm trying to combine it with other interests.",1273835627

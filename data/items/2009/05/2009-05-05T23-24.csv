It's unclear why you think that refraining from doing so is some sort of virtue.<p>> Poor analogy, implies that there's some kind of cost/downside to the rich in this role.<p>There is a downside.  They pay 90% of the NRE.  If they're not 90% of the relevant population, they've paid much of the NRE for the rest of us.

If you look at comparable populations, the difference that you're fixated on disappears.<p>Or, in stat-speak - averages can be deceptive.<p>>  it's in the interest of the wealthy to advance justifications to support their position, whether they're reasonable or not.<p>And what's my interest?<p>Note that everyone has ""interest"", yet only interests attributed to the wealthy rate a mention.

So I wouldn't doubt you'd be able to make a fully electric airplane that is capable of flying a fair distance. In fact, fuel efficiency in airplanes can be better than most cars. Again the fuel efficiency can also be affected by the parts used (obviously li-ion would be the minimum, lead-acid would either weigh too much or you'd plummet to your death after 5 miles) and thin-film PV cells could easily be applied to a plane's broad wingspan, however this likely wouldn't increase the flight distance much (even with 100% efficiency and optimal conditions, your average ultra-light wingspan wouldn't ever produce the total power needed for a 80HP/60KW motor).",1241564912

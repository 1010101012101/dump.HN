If I am a web developer using the service, do myself and my client both qualify as individual ""users""? Can we both use the same account?<p>To simplify the packages I would probably split them up into three different tiers:<p>Free\n- 5 Pages<p>Basic - $10/mo.\n- 20 Pages<p>Advanced - $20/mo.\n- 100 Pages<p>I would give all accounts unlimited users and unlimited ""API Hits"" to reduce confusion. If an individual account is bogging down the system I would deal with that if the time comes rather than try to explain to people what an API hit is.<p>One thing I find curious is that it appears that the client's server requests the data from BitsyBox via a PHP include in which case I am wondering about the content delivery via CDN claim.

For instance the Ruby client supports this feature in a way mostly transparent to the client.<p>In traditional databases sharding is hard not because they are not good at it form the point of view of ""feature set"" (like in Redis VS Cassandra), but because the data model itself is not right for working with data split across different servers. If you use an SQL DB just with tables accessed by IDs and without queries more complex than lookups by primary key, then sharing starts to become simpler.<p>Even if Redis will ever get server-side sharding, I'll code another process that handles this issue instead to put the logic inside Redis itself.<p>Btw how is it possible to build something really horizontally scalable without to use client-level sharding?<p>What you want is to have N web server and M databases, without any single-dispatch-node.

This chapter is focused on motivation in the workplace, and he does have several concrete proposals, organized into sections: 1. Abolish Incentives - While pay is not a motivator, it can be a demotivator. ""Pay generously and equitably...Then do everything in your power to put money out of [the employees] minds."" 2. Re-evaluate Evaluation - Do away with the regularly scheduled performance review, and instead give employees regular, useful feedback, and in particular, the entire process of giving feedback should be separate from the process that determines compensation. 3. Create the Conditions for Authentic Motiviation - Attend to ""the collaboration that defines the context of work, the content of the tasks, and the extent to which people have some choice about what they do and how they do it."" He goes on to give more details about these three conditions in the second half of the chapter.<p>The other 2 chapters in this end section are similar, with one each focusing on raising children and how to structure education.",1256233149

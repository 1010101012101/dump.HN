I don't see any benefit in restating what has already been said, worse. Think of the article as a library function I called.<p>It's an obvious point that there will be some rare souls who prefer Android. For example, if the importance you put on a working Google Voice implementation counts for more than the sum of all possible other goods a phone might offer you, then maybe the iPhone is not right for you. Likewise, a child who will eat nothing but fish sticks will likely prefer them to the best filet mignon ever cooked.

Michael Heller from Columbia Law School writes about new therapies that companies can't bring to market because they involve dozens or hundreds of different genes or compounds, each patented separately; he argues that this will become more common because of trends in medical science.  He also cites some interesting examples like <a href=""http://www.goldenrice.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goldenrice.org/</a> which actually did get produced, but only because they formed a non-profit foundation and basically shamed companies into licensing their patents as charity for the developing world.<p>Many, many more details in Heller's book and in this Econtalk interview:<p><a href=""http://www.gridlockeconomy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridlockeconomy.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/11/heller_on_gridl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/11/heller_on_gridl.htm...</a>",1263278614

1046996,comment,1046388,1046837,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> their whole business is litigating patents, so tying them up in court is not exactly a deterrent.<p>Lawyers can make a considerable amount of money, any disruption to the Patent Trolls' game will severely reduce their numbers. These Patent trolls, as you said, are often lawyers and by tying them up in court you are costing them profitability. Every non-settlement <i>forces</i> them to go to court and actually fight.<p>This is how the courts work: Out-of-court settlements are frequent and are preferred as it saves a Judge's time for real cases, however mass submission and withdrawal of suits are seen as a waste of the courts time and effort. A fair amount of cases end up in front of a judge before settlement, if these end up being withdrawn (and the judge will know it's withdrawn <i>not</i> settled) you're going to be in bad credence with a judge. Pissing off a judge is a big no-no. Patent Trolls will be pissing off multiple judges, which is like putting a shotgun in your career's mouth and pulling the trigger.<p>An insurance agency that fights patent trolls would be ideal. Offer $X amount of legal fee coverage for $Y a month, get a few talented lawyers and a fair amount of paralegals. Once word gets out, the majority of the work can be performed by paralegals (essentially everything up until you're standing in front of a jury-or-equivalent can be performed by paralegals) as no troll will want their time tied up. Eventually, only Trolls with a fair-case will fight, you then have 3 options to give your clients: offer them your lawyers' services/suggest settling/wish them good luck elsewhere. It would be a sort of no-case-no-extra-fee's deal.<p>Lawyer's typically bill by the 6-minute interval, and frequently charge 100's of dollars an hour. In  fact 1-2 billed hours is typically a lawyers daily pay, and they may still have 6-8 hours on top of what they're billing clients. If you start consuming these lawyers time, their profitability drops, especially considering they require settlements for their pay. They're invested in the 'easy win', which isn't conducive to fighting a drawn out case. If companies actually start going through with the court battles, the payment is potentially delayed anywhere from 3-months to 3-years.",1263278298

Despite only that single expense being in question, the auditor asked for complete sales and expense records, which took literally reams of paper to print out, then organize and bind into folders for me to ship (I was out of state at the time of the audit and they wouldn't move it to a local auditor). It took days to click through pages and pages of history at PayPal to provide a separate printed receipt for over 1,000 separate sales, just for starters. I simply used the QuickBooks export to do my accounting, no need to keep each individual receipt on paper.<p>In the end all those reams of paper added up to exactly what I reported on my taxes, to the penny, and the ""investigation"" was closed with no changes to my taxes.<p>I hope every year that the audit means they'll be less likely to audit me again since I always have the same big single deductions each year (suppliers mostly).",1263277537

There is plenty of information available on a book or movie, submitted by users -- spoilers too. As long as there isn't verbatim material provided in whole contexts, I see no problem. People review books all the time; they even summarize its entire content.<p>If I misunderstood your idea's intent, let me know. ",1172958353

2048,comment,2033,2038,0,0,danielha,,,"Competence is of the utmost importance, but it'd be a mistake to ignore those who don't hold the exact same skill-set as you. A startup needs a variety of talents, and it's usually the case where there is some member of the founding team who is the most brilliant hacker, or someone who's great with user interfaces, or someone who has a knack for design and testing.<p>I do agree that your partner should have a hackers' passion and be technically competent. You don't need someone that's all theoretical and won't get down and dirty with some code.",1172957796
2047,comment,2033,2043,0,0,jwecker,,,"working with != partnership.   I really think it's a different beast.  I've also been in bands and occasionally someone would say ""I'd love to partner up with you guys and manage your band or do PR for you guys.""  If they had experience playing or producing music, we'd give them a chance.  If they listened to the radio and fantasized about being in charge of the back-stage passes for the next big band, but had never picked up a guitar- no chance.",1172957771

2044,comment,2033,2041,0,0,jwecker,,,"I could live with that definition, but I've had 2 partnerships now in 2 different companies where I felt the person had qualified on those grounds and while they are still great friends etc., I was a bit disappointed.  If it is a tech company, I really think they both have to have real tech expertise.  It has little to do with just having someone else to do the programming- in both of those partnerships the partner was more than willing to defer to me on all technical matters that they perceived to be technical matters.<p>In a tech company, though, _everything_ is a technical matter- for example- marketing.  Early adopters for 99% of tech products are geeks- if you are not one then you do not understand the market (hence all those MBA lead failures of the late 90's).  Finance for a tech startup usually has to tie into the product / subscriptions, etc- and is thus a tech problem.  PR is to fellow geeks, etc. etc.  Then there's the fact that the bulk of the work to be done is technical- if you're going to be having allnighters for the next 3 months getting a product out- there is a _big_ difference between having a partner who is right there with you in the trenches coding across the room, and a partner who comes by every day and says ""well, uh, how's it going?""- you spend the next hour trying to explain the latest hangup etc. and then they say ""well, let me know if the schedule changes- I've got some great customers lined up..."" or whatever.<p>Sometimes that situation is unavoidable, but I guarantee it is not optimal.",1172957434
2043,comment,2033,2041,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Agreed. If you're a musician and you never partner with someone who isn't as good at singing then you'll never have a band. If you're a writer and you never partner with anyone who isn't as good at writing then you'll have no editor, no publisher, and no book. <p>I don't see why a startup should be any different. You have so many tasks (design, engineering, coding, selling, fundraising, partnering, etc.) that it makes no sense to only work with people of the same skillset. ",1172957225

2041,comment,2033,2038,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'd amend that to ""Never partner with someone who is not technically literate as you, *if* they think they are as technically literate as you or believe that technical literacy is not important.""<p>It can often be very productive to partner with someone with people skills, or business skills, or finance skills.  Those things *are* important, and yet you won't have spare brain cycles for them if you're doing hardcore programming.  That person just needs to realize that *you* call the shots when it comes to technical decisions.<p>Warren Buffett's advice applies, as always.  ""It's not how much you know that matters.  It's how realistically you assess what you *don't* know.""",1172956778

You could then/also require that any quote over 1 sentence (which could be safely covered by fair use) or maybe even any quote at all is simply a reference to the book itself- maybe even formalize the referencing system.

Sometimes sitting down and trying to write for an hour is like trying to bleed a stone, some days it just isn't going to happen.<p>I've noticed I can easily get 3,000 words done in a few days without a problem, but the extra 2,000 words before I finish a chapter tends to screw me up. Suddenly I'm doing two jobs at once, I have to finish one story line but tie it to the next. I also hate the advice of 'you should write <i>n</i> words a day no matter what', because it's inherently useless advice.

On the other hand, they argue that this ""arms race"" to get into the best college psychologically harms kids because they pack their schedules with stuff they don't really want to do in order to get in.  But if all colleges within a tier are basically the same, why don't kids just ignore them, do what they want, and let the cards fall where they may?<p>I did basically that in high school - I blew off classes, picked activities that <i>I</i> wanted to do rather than ones that'd look good, refused to take any SAT prep courses, and didn't even apply to college while I was in high school (I worked a year and then applied).  When it came to application time, I picked half a dozen colleges that I wouldn't mind going to, with no clear favorites, and got in at 3 others.  I don't think my life has been all that different because of it: in most people's minds, Amherst is as good as Brown which is as good as Rice which is as good as Stanford.

Since then the market has become overcrowded. People starting out today don't have the same early mover advantage. Even a passionate and well written blog has to fight for attention against thousands of more established competitors. Bloggers have also gotten more competition conscious and stopped linking as freely as they used to. Twitter, Facebook, et al are sucking up a lot of the attention that used to go to blogs.

535296,comment,534569,535001,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"IMO there's no point in building a vac-tunnel for a modern train car, because firstly it needs to be an airtight vehicle.<p>When traveling at 4,000 mph you don't necessarily have to slow down, you just need to levitate from the sides of the tunnel. Essentially you could make the train act similar to a swinging cart on a roller coaster where the center of gravity will always try to sit under the user. People can easily tolerate positive vertical gee forces with little to no side effect, yet exposure to less than one vertical gee force (like the chair-drop rides at theme parks) can make someone puke their guts out. Equally horizontal gee forces aren't tolerated very well either, but in the linear axis (the one we accelerate through) we're extremely tolerant and are in fact more tolerant if we're facing backwards. Although I don't think facing backwards would necessarily work on a train, you don't really want to hit 2 gees of acceleration and have your coke fly in a straight line to the back wall.<p>Also acceleration wouldn't need to take too long, however in this systems design it probably would. In the dumb car, smart track systems all the force is applied from the outside, which is where acceleration could potentially reach incredible speeds due to the sheer amount of power that could be expended to do so.<p>We're a long, long way from any vac-tube form of rapid transit, but if we ever get to it I think tolerating the corners will likely be a small problem. I think the big problem will be keeping the train pressurized under potentially huge pressure differentials due to the acceleration.",1238171228

That is a huge task when you're competing against bloggers who are living the life that they're writing about (I'm looking at you, Bruce Schneier).<p>Look, a magazine is a delivery mechanism.  If you want to start a magazine you have to create your content, then find a publisher to publish it and distribute it, you (or your publisher) have to eat the cost of magazines that don't sell.  You need to fill a whole however many pages long your magazine is.<p>The internet is also a delivery mechanism, the difference is that if you build the content and put it on the digital newstands like reddit,digg, or gibsonandlily.com costs you absolutely nothing, infinitely less than it would cost to put it on its real-world counterpart.<p>Print media is dying, or is already dead.<p>Things like Communication Arts, or Print (these are both graphic design magazines) can, I think, remain in business, but the bubble-gum poppy trip such as 17 magazine, or Cosmo are going to disappear shortly (if they haven't already).<p>Note...me mentioning 17 and Cosmo isn't because I'm a male chauvinist bastard, it's because I grew up in a house with 5 sisters...the house was littered with these magazines.",1238171195

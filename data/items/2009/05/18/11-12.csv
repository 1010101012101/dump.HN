This party is at a disadvantage after a divorce, and in some cases it may be reasonable to compensate for it.<p>Ideally this should be a tiered system when payments wind down over time (but usually isn't).",1242647972

It seems like you wrote it right after your horrible experience, so being a little dramatic is normal, but go through it again and tone it down (now that you're a bit less frustrated).<p>With that out of the way, I think the redesign is wonderful, it really makes the experience much less painful. Sure, some of the legacy classes of travelers are an annoyance, and I'm sure if American Airlines had to do it again, they wouldn't create so many sub-classes. Like dealing with real clients, you simply have to accept some legacy standards and work around them (maybe explain to me clearly the difference between classes).<p>Overall, it looks like you did a lot of work and I love the end result, could you maybe post a little before/after with some details on what you decided to cross out or move around?<p>Your friendly blogger,\nVlad (vladg.com)",1242647565

After all, a put option is basically a contract whose value is derived from the price of a certain security / commodity (in this case corn) at a certain point in the future. Depending on the price of corn, the buyer of the option will choose whether or not to exercize the right to sell the agreed ammount of corn.<p><i>""and created money where none should exist""</i><p>None should exist?

The rest of the tracks are more or less filler so they can justify charging $15 for a long play album.<p>With digital distribution becoming more popular and consumers buying more singles instead of full albums, I thought pop artists would be the first to stop releasing full-length albums. I guess this is just another example of the music industry being unable or unwilling to adapt to the changing landscape.<p>I really do hope, though, as you mentioned, that real musicians continue to put in the creativity and hard work it takes to produce full albums.

Albums make sense when you have to press a physical medium and distribute it across the country/world, not so much with a purely digital distribution.<p>The making of individual tracks also works well with pop music and its mentality, actually, it makes tons of sense, cutting costs by only writing and recording a few songs and spoon feeding it to the radio stations and the general public. The move away from albums is a total shame from an artistic view point. You'd never end up with masterpiece albums like ""Dark Side of the Moon"" with bands recording a few tracks at a time. I also connect so much of a band and their era's by albums too. Metallica and their change with the black album and everything after that.

And the author's position that folks would be able to withdraw funds that exceed a certain ceiling adds the perverse incentive to risk not spending this money, with the downside being absorbed by the catastrophic plan.<p>On the other hand, you'd do nothing to discourage consumers with irrational fears about their health from distorting prices upwards, or to discourage unscrupulous providers from fomenting those fears.  The plan he describes takes fee-for-service and all its problems to a whole new level.  I think of things like the celebrity anti-vaccine mess and the healthcare debate with its distorted media coverage and disingenuous advertising, and I have hard time accepting a consumer-driven market succeeding, even with all the government-collected and -analyzed data in the world.<p>Even worse, I fear that such a system would result in a tiered system, where the best and brightest providers provide excessive care to those with means while the rest of us continue to struggle with barely adequate, barely affordable care.<p>I don't think that any system that relies on healthcare consumers making the choice between limiting their usage of healthcare services and spending money is destined for success.  Providers need to be rewarded for providing the best outcomes for the lowest cost with the fewest mistakes, not the most and most expensive services.  Significant efforts must be made to improve the public health of Americans.  The conversation should be about how to make those things happen.  All this debate about who pays when is just a side show that is obstructing real reform.",1250193927

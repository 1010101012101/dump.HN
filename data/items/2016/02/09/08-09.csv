Simply by assuming it to be true?<p>How does acting like the problem doesn&#x27;t exist solve the problem? If that&#x27;s not what you mean, then do you mean we should all just <i>suddenly stop being racist/sexist/bigotted/etc</i>? Just like that? How would that work? How do you get your neighbor to go along with that? Or white middle manager, who means well but is uncomfortable hiring people of certain ethnicities or sexualities because of &quot;culture fit&quot;? It seems that anyone willing to do what you are saying, if I&#x27;m understanding it correctly, is probably already of the belief that a world without racism/sexism/etc would be better, and already behaves in the manner you suggest.

It would have to be more than a temporary breach to have a substantial effect.<p>The concept is to make it impossible to do business under the existing conditions. If hospital systems are unable to bill their patients because their systems are constantly scrambled by vigilantes, it&#x27;ll affect the cost-benefit calculation involved in continuing operation under their existing business model.<p>Undoubtedly there would be confusion and misapplied bills involved. I don&#x27;t see that as detrimental to the overarching cause. The only reason these systems are able to operate as-is is because their architects have devised a carefully fragmented and extremely confusing system that splits American society such that unity on the issue can&#x27;t be achieved without substantial personal cost to the members of the more powerful/useful social factions.<p>If someone can level that playing field, we&#x27;ll be well on our way to substantive change. When the powerful people have to feel the indignity of getting their credit wrecked for a decade or more because their kid fell down at a playground and got a concussion, <i>even though</i> they took every precaution that the man said they&#x27;d have to take to survive this kind of routine nightmare semi-intact, the rules will change much faster.<p>At present, the poor get their medical care pretty well taken care of through Medicaid. The rich don&#x27;t care because they can throw infinity money at health problems (which is not to say they actually have to). It&#x27;s the middle class that&#x27;s getting raked over the coals, because they&#x27;re not rich enough to force a change through monetary influence and they have too much to lose to force a change through social action.<p>I&#x27;m really not even a single-payer or socialized medicine kind of guy, but the current system is the worst of all worlds. The ACA provided a few useful tweaks but overall the system is just getting worse and worse. It shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to stand.",1455008029

The token would include details of how long the API should wait before fulfilling the request (or just block it the request). This would require every API server in the network being able to decrypt requests from any other server, which is a problem, but securely sharing keys <i>can</i> be done.

Those changes will definitely decrease the ROI of real estate investment, but don&#x27;t necessarily reflect a decrease in production.<p>Meanwhile, disruptive technologies challenge traditional protected market sectors as regulatory barriers fail to catch-up with new threats to existing businesses (e.g. Uber, Airbnb). Again, those changes will decrease ROI in traditional sectors, and due to efficiencies in the new model the overall money spent in these sectors may decrease.<p>In effect we could be revisiting the arguments around Marx&#x27;s &quot;tendency of the rate of profit to fall&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit...</a>).<p>The flip side to these impacts is that the rapid change to the economy hasn&#x27;t yet been fully appreciated or addressed by current government policy.<p>For example, improvements in health technology have extended the age to which the Baby Boomer generation has been able to remain in the workforce, as well as overall life expectancy, placing far greater strain on social services and health planning than expected.<p>At the same time, &quot;entry&quot; jobs have far greater expectations than 30 years ago as automation has reduced the need for unskilled/entry labour, while increasing the demand for highly-skilled specialisations. This has delayed the entry of Gen Y into the workplace (with many workplaces unwilling to invest in training entry-level workers and at best offering unpaid internships) which has meant far reduced consumption and tax revenue than might otherwise be expected demographically. This has created a bit of a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem as reduced consumption doesn&#x27;t justify increased hiring, but the lack of jobs prevents consumption (and experience required to add greater wealth).<p>Finally, effects on the value of labour have increased inequality (for better or worse as the pg essay controversy demonstrates). In effect, if there is less value for unskilled labour there is the potential for increased demand on social services (see the whole Basic Income debate). Meanwhile the scarcity of high-demand labour increases the wealth accumulated by the educated and talented. How this plays out over time is an interesting question.<p>This problem has been exacerbated in recent times by monetary policy that has seen far more money flow into the economy only to be captured by well-placed rent-seekers (see Occupy Wall Street etc.).<p>Add in the historical increases in global debt and recent geopolitical pressure on energy production and you have a perfect recipe for current economic troubles.",1455006574

I&#x27;ve installed it recently in my family computers since it&#x27;ll protect them from many nasty stuff besides the ads. However, they are surely not able to add any site to the whitelist (they just know they don&#x27;t get advertising).<p>Furthermore, with population aging, I think that for the next 10-30 this will make the adoption even stronger. So let&#x27;s say that it keeps going on until most of the people use some adblock. What is the situation then? Let&#x27;s explore one option:<p>No one sees advertising/tracking on the web. Newspapers, magazines and others have either adapted or died. So, for Wire&#x27;s example, allowing for an ad-sponsored site makes no sense since most of the people use adblocking so there&#x27;s not much public left. Now I don&#x27;t know anything about paid online magazine, but I&#x27;ve read that their numbers are not so great.<p>So who&#x27;s left?<p>- Websites that do it for free to scratch an itch such as codinghorror and Joel on Software.<p>- Corporate blogs that act like news press to improve the brand. This could include Tesla&#x27;s blog, SpaceX&#x27;s news, etc.<p>- Blogs that make it a content strategy so you buy their product such as GrooveHQ.<p>- Personal or professional review sites with referral links.<p>This is arguably a stronger change than when printed papers went online or when they went mobile, since their business model remained unchanged.

Although they encourage people not to use the term &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;, I think that&#x27;s from the perspective that ideas are not property.  This is not at odds with (my understanding of) the legal definition of IP (the name notwithstanding).  The property in IP, is the monopoly it affords, not the idea.  You can&#x27;t own an idea (i.e. it is not legal to do so).  You <i>can</i> own the government granted monopoly for implementing that idea.<p>The FSF is pro-copyright and pro-trademark.  You can literally own software.  In fact, one of the things the GPL makes very clear is that once you have given/sold someone the software, you can&#x27;t suddenly revoke their rights to use it in any way they see fit.  In fact the FSF is very outspoken about the dangers of using services which remove that right (for example ebooks where the seller can suddenly revoke your right to read the book).<p>When you receive software under the GPL, you <i>own</i> that copy.  It is literally yours.  You can modify it.  You can study it.  You can give it or sell it (for any amount of money) to someone else.  Not only that, but you do <i>not</i> own the copyrights.  The copyrights are owned by someone else and are not transferred with the software.  So this means that you can not change the license, even with a derived work.<p>They like it that way.  They do not want to change the ability to own software or own copyrights.  The GPL does not subvert the notion of software as property -- it enforces the normal rights you would have if it were physical property.",1455004869

If you work for one of the big companies, your stock options will get you pretty close to that. If you&#x27;re a manager, bonuses and incentive pay will also bridge the gap. If you&#x27;re an independent consultant and you&#x27;re not making at least this much, you&#x27;re really missing the boat.<p>Are you a senior software engineer, or middle management or higher? Is you partner also? Then it&#x27;s _highly_ likely that your household is a 1% household<p>More importantly, the IRS considers any group of people who live together to be a household. I know of many people here in SF who have two, three, four roommates, each making six figures in tech. Essentially all of those households are 1% households.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve pointed this out to several people I know. Without fail, they always have reasons why they don&#x27;t count. &quot;Oh cost of living is too high&quot;. &quot;Oh, I have to pay back student loans, my disposable income isn&#x27;t this&quot;. &quot;Oh, sure I make this much but look at my taxes&quot;.<p>In reality, describing &quot;the 1%&quot; is not a useful description. For one, many of the 1% are people living middle class lives in high cost-of-living areas. On the one hand, it is true that in dollar terms these people are, literally, in the 1%. But they don&#x27;t live the lifestyles that people think of when they say 1%. And if you think about it, that makes sense. By definition, one in every 100 Americans are in the 1%. That&#x27;s three million people.<p>We don&#x27;t have any chance of solving economic disparity problems when our intuitions are so wildly off base from our rhetoric and our actions. Wish more people would think these things through",1454482753

And your job is to build that software, and figure out exactly what&#x27;s required for it.<p>In phase 1, you <i>need</i> the creative-genius programmers, and they need to work in small teams with large amounts of autonomy.  Because most of what goes on in phase 1 is failure: you are learning about the problem space and all of its corner-cases, you&#x27;re trying out different approaches, and you&#x27;re hoping to make that one creative leap that brings everything together.  Prototyping is invaluable, refactoring is important, and deadlines and estimates might as well be plucked out of thin air.  To successfully run a phase 1 project, you often need to be able to redefine success.  When I read the article, my first impulse was to say &quot;Well, the biggest fuckup management made was to not cancel the feature, because they had ample evidence that this feature was not worth the cost.&quot;  A startup&#x27;s entire life is spent in phase 1, because once it&#x27;s exited phase 1 it&#x27;s called a &quot;high-growth company&quot;, and their version of redefining success is the pivot.<p>Phase 2 is &quot;make it work&quot;.  You start phase 2 with a working prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of what you&#x27;re hoping to do, but still has a lot of rough edges.  And your job is to polish it down to something that the customer wants to use daily.  That means fixing bugs, improving usability, adding admin tools & logging, improving performance and reliability, ensuring security, etc.<p>In phase 2, you need a much larger team of disciplined, detail-oriented engineers.  Because debugging can be parallelized.  You need unit tests, you need formal processes, you need issue trackers, you usually need PMs or management.  It helps to break things into user stories so that you know you&#x27;re always making progress.<p>I see a fair amount of hate for Agile and Scrum on HN, but <i>these are tools</i>, and specifically tools for Phase 2 work.  I use them myself, for my own projects, because I find that they help me manage all the little tasks involved in bringing a product to market.  The hate comes from people who misapply them: startups who have big-company management who blindly apply what worked at their last employer, or established companies that are trying to do new green-field projects and believe it works the same way improving your 10-year-old product works.  But similarly, there are a large number of abandoned startups and open-source projects that never bothered to cross the Ts and dot the Is, and so are largely useless to people.",1454482346

Slower than what? Being months behind schedule?<p>I get that some PMs can undervalue refactoring code / minimizing technical debt, and that&#x27;s super frustrating and shortsighted. But the basic premise of this criticism of agile process is deeply flawed:<p>1. The claim that features took &quot;longer&quot; to ship is directly contradictory to the admission that the project was months behind schedule.<p>2. If they were behind schedule, then &quot;inflating&quot; their estimates in response to a detailed tracking process was not, in fact, an inflation. It was a reality check.<p>Estimates are really hard. But the solution is not to just &quot;give autonomy&quot; with zero estimation, because that&#x27;s how you get into that problem they had in the first place: a guy in a room that doesn&#x27;t ship for months. That&#x27;s why agile&#x27;s approach of breaking things down into tasks with very rough sizing and measuring actual after-the-fact time and shipping small milestones frequently is so helpful. You don&#x27;t have to have super accurate estimates. You just need to report your time and then it figures out a team &quot;velocity&quot;.

I realize Google by having dominant search-engine marketshare and obfuscating their search-terms  from their referrer url makes visitor analysis <i>literally impossible</i> without joining the Google Analytics dragnet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone is willing to do so, nor that they will do it every time. It may in fact be illegal for one to do so.<p>One example would be doing business with local government agencies and having to comply with EU data-locality rules. Will adding Google analytics to my site violate those rules? I don&#x27;t know. But I know I wouldn&#x27;t risk me being in compliance or not up to chance. Automatically adding third party US-based user-tracking to my service certainly doesn&#x27;t sound very compliant.<p>Another example would be if you already have concrete TOS with your customer-base which does not include leaking customer data to a unrelated third party, and especially if you deliver on site software to buying customers. If I bought some software, deployed it on my network and <i>then</i> discovered it was spying on me and reporting everything I did to google, I would be pretty pissed off.<p>Adding it automatically to my product &quot;out of the box&quot; for a completely unrelated service (nginx optimizations) is akin to drive-by installers of the Windows desktop-age.<p>You know what they say about ducks: If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck, it&#x27;s probably a duck.<p>This looks like spyware, deploys like spyware and behaves like spyware.

And, importantly, how to tailor processes to each team member to make them as effective as possible. And they work together collaboratively to solve problems—estimating and discussing features flexibly, not tossing pie in the sky specs and finished products over the fence.<p>In this instance it sounds like they didn&#x27;t do a great job of working with existing scrappy developers&#x27; potential, but instead supplanted a new framework (eng/PM) they had seen work before, and the blunt hammer of that move destroyed a lot of potential the early team had invested in. It sounds like there was a general communication issue that was crippling the team even before a producer and new hires came in.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few teams now grow from no dev process to combinations of issue trackers, estimates, specs etc. Around 14-20 developers it becomes nearly inevitable for someone to take on a high level production role and someone to take point for engineering reliability, whether those are official job titles or not.<p>Often this period coincides with when early team members move on. It&#x27;s rad when growing companies find ways to keep those early, scrappy hires with deep historical product knowledge in productive roles as the company grows and shifts priorities from staff-leanness and product-speed to staff-scale and product-predictability. But that&#x27;s often unfortunately not what happens, and it can be extremely painful for both early team members and those trying to evolve the company. (Growing pains!)",1454481145

Try interviewing at MS, big G or Amazon and you will see what I mean.<p>These developers are great as code monkeys, but a lot of them don&#x27;t have any idea what their code contributes to, or even how their business makes money. I attended a hackathon with a number of Amazon employees, and one of my distinct memories was a Principal Engineer who didn&#x27;t even know what &quot;publicly traded&quot; meant and was sure that Bezos owned 100% of the company.<p>A potential solution to this issue, is to hire engineers with more diverse skillsets. Deep understanding of mathematics and classical algorithms is fantastic for software performance, and low level details.<p>On the other hand, at a tech company - your software is literally your revenue stream. You are hiring people who don&#x27;t understand your business - to build and grow your business.<p>Maybe hire some developers with strong business skills, and a good understanding of the economy and your market - and put them on a team with more traditional engineers. In doing so, you get someone with the big picture, and someone with the details working together and might not even need another PM.<p>Just my thoughts.",1454479689

Then came machine learning.<p>In that context, this advance is a sign that there&#x27;s still momentum going in the current ML paradigm - the hardest board game was at last solved! But as many have pointed out, there&#x27;s a time in the near future where this approach too will stall short of ambitions. Will this lead to another winter?<p>For the algorithm ideologues probably yes. The key to current interest was that NN do vision extremely well, which can be built into image search, etc, which can be commercialized. So I think you are right that R&D for self-driving cars will be the sustaining investment in this field for the future, and this will drag AI research towards &quot;animal common sense&quot; as a goal. If they build a hell of safe car and the people buy into it, there could a Cambrian explosion in AI. But its failure or rejection could break the field too.",1454479599

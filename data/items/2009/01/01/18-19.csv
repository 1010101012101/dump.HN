Really, Facebook events are great for parties and things when you can't get everyone together at once to plan/discuss/whatever, (or when you're antisocial like me and you don't want to).  A lot less phone calls and such to mess with, and a built-in discussion board and RSVP system to boot.",1230836041

416568,comment,414330,416282,0,0,mmmurf,,,"I agree that the item you mention is not a particularly strong argument, but I wanted to mention some examples of how rent control blocks a price signal that might even be useful for the beneficiary of rent control.  I think it's uncontroversial that it blocks the price signal to renovate the buildings and to build new affordable housing as discussed above.<p>But if you agree on the major point that the social engineering geared at getting people to live/work in one place for a long time is on the wrong track, then our differences seem focused on rent control.<p>I should mention that in my last building in SF there was a guy who had lived there in a rent controlled apartment since the 1970s.  After the first year I lived there, a letter arrived in the mail informing me that rent would increase by exactly 1.5%, the maximum increase allowed by law, and that the landlord was pushing for ""utility cost pass-through"", a rent-control exception that allows slightly bigger increases in cases of utility price jumps.  So I was a beneficiary of rent control.<p>Back to the guy.  His apartment had a view of the bay and golden gate bridge from every window, including the bathroom.  It could probably be rented for $3500+/month because of the amazing views.  He was a wealthy lawyer, arch-enemy of the landlord and heavily involved in the tenants union, and completely not in need of any help paying rent. With rent control he was probably paying under $1000/month for his apartment and had been for years.  He will probably live there until the day he dies.<p>I'd have been far less skeptical of rent control if there had been an immigrant family living in that apartment or someone who worked at the local Walgreens.",1230835894
416567,comment,416530,416530,0,0,smoody,,,"Counter to what most people believe, I see development on Open Source apps and libraries slowing waaaay down in 2009.<p>- Most people are expecting a downturn uptick in open source development because there will be more unemployed engineers, but unemployed engineers need to pay rent, put food on the table, etc. so developing open source code will be a luxury like subscribing to premium cable channels. Instead, they'll be fully focused on finding work.<p>- Because being part of a team of people working on open source apps can help engineers get a job, expect people to 'join' projects for resume purposes but not really have the time (or desire) to participate.<p>- Desperate times call for desperate measures and when engineers are considering taking their substantial code base and making it open source, I believe they are less likely to do it during a bad economy simply because there are fewer ways to profit from that move.<p>- And, on a tangential note, I expect the biggest winners during 2009 will ultimately be the drug companies -- especially those that produce anti-anxiety pills.<p>My two cents.",1230835866

Technology is typically a lagging indicator, as its still dependent on other large industries for most of its revenue.<p>Look to see 25-30% cutbacks in spending for the industry leaders (Google, Microsoft, IBM) and tech startups (the funded ones) to tighten belts for real this time.<p>It may seem bad now, but the tech sector all and all has been nearly immune to the economic downturn compared to other industries (retail, auto, financial, and real estate).<p>The tech companies that will contract least will be ones who cater to the entertainment market (games primarily).<p>Hopefully I don't sound too pessimistic. Personally, I've been happily employed throughout the downturn, making as much or more than I'd been getting in the boom times.

416543,comment,416408,416512,0,0,mdasen,,,"Yeah, the euro is being managed quite well.<p>In terms of recession vs. inflation control, most central banks don't see recessions as their domain at all.  The ECB wades into it more than probably any except the Fed and it's probably a good thing.  Most people hate the idea of manipulating money to deal with recessions and booms - heck, it pisses me off.  It's not a good situation - it's often like picking political candidates; you choose the lesser evil.<p>What people worry about with recession targeting is that it will cause inflation.  It can and many countries have shown <i>very bad</i> results with it.  The problem occurs because, as you expand the supply of money, each individual unit is worth less of the pie.  That's ok for a short while.  The problem that most countries get into is that they don't stop it when things get better or that there's a perception that they won't stop it when things get better.<p>While the Fed plays a little looser than I would like, they've shown that they can effectively target recessions without causing inflationary problems by having long-term discipline.  And people accept that it won't happen because of the Fed's history of it not happening.  The ECB, while young, enjoys a good reputation and that's why they felt that they could continue to push rates down to target the recession (although not as strongly as the Fed has).  They know that people accept that they have a good long-term monetary policy that won't just continually expand the money supply as many countries have.<p>In terms of economies not fully synched, I don't fully see it.  I mean, the economy of Massachusetts isn't going to move lockstep with the economy of Michigan.  They're incredibly different - probably more different than, say, the economies of Germany and France.  What makes the economies of different countries different?  Differences in workforce, differences in natural resources, differences in industries. . .  All of those vary regionally in the US.  Iowa and Nebraska's farming economy aren't anything like Massachusetts' biotech economy.  And, what we're seeing right now is that Europe is affected as a unit by this recession (or as much as ever happens).  You can always make the case that you can subdivide something to be more accurate, but for practical purposes coming together works well.  Do you think Europe is more diverse than the US in this way?  That's serious because I could be overlooking something big that's just not on my mind after being up until 4am last night.<p>The euro has been one of the greatest things to happen to Europe.  It's not mismanaged and has a bright future, but it's premature to say that it's the new dollar.  That would be like saying Linux is going to replace Windows on people's desktops.  It might happen.  Linux is good.  It's gaining favor every day.  It might be better.  However, it will still be a good while before Windows is displaced if it ever is and it's premature to assume it will be.",1230833777

Presumably there was a reason that Google chose to not release it until now; the usual reason is that Google doesn&#x27;t want people building apps on unstable APIs, because that means a bad experience for both consumers and developers.

7173433,comment,,7171653,4,0,clbecker,,,"That looks pretty cool.  As far as scaling issues went, the bulk of them were addressed just by using Solr on pretty beefy hardware (for our full library of 30+ million images, we&#x27;re running on Dell r510s w/ 24 cores and 128GB Ram).  Of course, depending on your hardware limitations there&#x27;s compromises you can make to increase speed / reduce memory usage - i.e. the fewer fields you need to index and sort on the better & the lower the cardinality of each field, the better too.  Also, since our input only consisted of one slider, we were able to run all the distance calculations beforehand, and just store a score that represented the image&#x27;s distance from the given slider position - something like that might also work for you, since you&#x27;re using a limited palette of input colors too.",1391461047

Humans correctly determined that the engines were not producing thrust and elected to make an off-runway landing instead of stalling the plane into airport-adjacent houses.<p>2) In the UA case, an engine failure disabled all three hydraulic systems, leaving the plane without primary flight controls.  The autopilot had no provision to command differential thrust from the two working engines, and would have driven the plane into the ground.<p>3) In the AC case, humans flew the plane at best L/D after running out of fuel, which enabled the airplane to land at a closed airport (any airport database would have told the autopilot it couldn&#x27;t land there).<p>4) In the US case, humans determined that making an airport landing would be impossible and elected to land the airplane on the Hudson river, which has (and never will have) a published approach procedure.<p>Please explain how you expect autopilot programmers to anticipate these scenarios and correctly chose a solution.",1391460325

7173304,comment,7172971,7173190,24,0,saurik,,,"This doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. The algorithm to construct optimally implemented lexers is not something any human would ever type by hand. Tools like flex were designed with one goal in mind: performance; it even has a mode that analyzes your set of tokens looking for &quot;mistakes&quot; that would cause backtracking, as it has a really keen interest in getting exactly linear performance. It also strives for an insanely low constant multiplier: the manual page even talks about the number of machine instructions used per character of input. Of course, some people might have needs that allow for lower throughput in exchange for &quot;less memory&quot;, so it had various modes to &quot;compress&quot; its lookup tables, with varying performance tradeoffs, which you can experiment with without changing your lexer definition. This is one of the super powers you get from &quot;the correct level of abstraction&quot;.<p>Like, seriously: what are you trying to achieve by writing your lexer by hand? Your result will be both more difficult to maintain and is pretty much guaranteed to be slower than the output of a tool like flex. At least when people throw away the advantages of parser generators and write recursive descent parsers they gain the ability to have &quot;easy context sensitivity&quot; (which makes implementing many languages much easier), but I don&#x27;t see why anyone would ever hand write a lexer. &quot;I know how it all works&quot; is also fine, but in that case you write your own lexer generator tool, you don&#x27;t skip directly to the lexer (unless you are doing your first one as a &quot;homework assignment&quot;). If you don&#x27;t like the input syntax of your lexer generator, there are many to choose from, or maybe you write one yourself, but that&#x27;s no reason to switch to something that is not only going to be more verbose and error-prone but will also be slower.<p>(afterthought: I guess an interesting analogy: you don&#x27;t lay out a hashtable by hand, like in a C initializer list in your source code that has a large number of NULL entries with only a subset filled in, already in hashed order; you instead write a hash function and let the computer reorder your entries for you. Manually hashing the values feels &quot;hard core&quot;, but offers no advantages, and means you have to throw away all of your work and start over when the size of your table changes. Doing it by hand is also strictly grunt work: you don&#x27;t gain anything by having placed it by hand other than the possibility that you made a mistake somewhere and now your element will never be found. And if later you want to try different hash functions or different search algorithms--maybe you are willing to pay some costs to get range queries, and end up using a tree--you can later do so without changing your input files. You should think of your lexer like a really complex data structure tied to an algorithm that always has the abstract interface &quot;get next token&quot;.)",1391459962

Due process rights should include the right to challenge the legality of evidence, if there is any question about it.

What that effect is can vary based on how the corporate culture views itself.<p>In this particular case I have had over the years a bit more visibility inside [1] the company than some others. And I had been working very hard to get access to their acceleration into third party OSes. The developer program was verbally very supportive of that, but actually not so much. After a lot of work and investigation the proximate cause was the extreme patent mess around graphics and Nvidia&#x27;s aggressive use of same to deal with competition.<p>I also discovered that at the executive level there was a belief that Nvidia was very supportive of Linux and third party use of their drivers. And even though I suggested reality was quite different than that, it didn&#x27;t really affect their thinking.<p>When Linus called them out, and the coverage of that went viral, I thought to myself &quot;This is going to be hard to explain in the context of an impression of support.&quot; In some ways having Nvidia <i>not</i> threaten or attack the nouveaux work was a big step forward. Actually contributing patches suggests to me complete surrender (or acceptance) of making &quot;real&quot; the notion of supporting third party use of their gear.<p>[1] My history was that a friend of mine from Sun was one fo the founders, he introduced me to the development program when the NV1 came out, I interviewed with them but did not take the job, but while at NetApp they were one of NetApps &quot;Top 20&quot; customers and I often spent time with their engineering teams working on ways their design flow would work better on network attached storage. A couple of former Intel colleagues ended up there, and a number of folks came over from there to Google when I was at Google as well.

I really can&#x27;t see how parallel construction can be performed either legally or in a way that would still make that evidence admissible in a court.<p>When the debate about the existence of domestic surveillance was hot, one of the counter-arguments against those who believed there to be a large-scale network was a Fermi-like &quot;If it exists, then where is it?&quot; since signs that such a network exists, such as evidence gathered by it appearing in court documents, were not appearing. The counter-argument was parallel reconstruction, but I recall a further point made by a lawyer who said they would be stupid to do that, since all the reconstructed evidence would be thrown out of court.<p>Wiretaps, search warrants, indictments etc. are all legal and sworn documents made by officers where they are required to disclose everything. I&#x27;m no means an expert, but i&#x27;d imagine a good defense lawyer (heck, or even a judge) would argue that the sworn statements were not entirely true and were compromised by using a surveillance system that is a black box and not open to court oversight. Search warrants get compromised for simple things such as showing up 5 minutes late, or taking something from the property that wasn&#x27;t covered (these rules are there for a reason, to protect us from all-knowing and over-reaching police forces).<p>As an aside, there was a case of parallel reconstruction in a mainstream news story last week. In the News Limited trials in the UK where former editors and journalists are being prosecuted for phone hacking one of the private detectives who was hired to hack phones for News spent an entire day in the witness seat talking about his methods and what they did.<p>In one of his stories, he had hacked the phone of Daniel Craig (an actor) and retrieved a voicemail left to him by Sienna Miller - an actress who is married to another famous actor - which indicated they were having an affair. He played the message for the editor of the News of the World who jumped up in excitement and said they had their new front page story. One problem: how will they reveal the source of the message since it was legal? Simple, the editor instructed the PI to place a recording of the tape into a brown paper bag and to drop it off to the front desk of the newspaper office while nobody was there. It would be an &#x27;anonymous tip&#x27;. It worked - the story said &#x27;an anonymous source, believed to be somebody close to the pair&#x27;, etc.<p>During the entire decade long phone hacking scandal there were all sorts of new &#x27;anonymous&#x27; sources popping up in news stories that it drove the celebrities mad. One actor spent tens of thousands of dollars sweeping his entire house for recording devices, another cut off contact with all friends because he couldn&#x27;t trust anybody anymore and another had all their staff undergo intense security checks to make sure they weren&#x27;t leaking.<p>In one case it led to someone being fired. The manager of a famous model was fired because a story leaked about how that model had been having an affair (or something) and even through the real source was a phone hack, the paper attributed it to a &#x27;close source&#x27;. The model fired her manager after a few stories - blaming her, and only found out years later that it was phone hacking. The manager is now suing both News Corp and the model.<p>If the DEA are practicing parallel reconstruction to the extent as many believe they are, one can only imagine the scope of similar unintended consequences. The stakes would be much higher: suspected snitches being murdered or disappeared by paranoid drug bosses.",1391458134

I can assume the worse and conclude they send 999 requests every 6 months, but then I&#x27;d be a conspiracy-nutcase. They know what they&#x27;re doing. Ed Snowden&#x27;s data is more valuable to the public than this PR stunt. If there are anymore of you people out there with info like Snowden considering doing a leak, please do it. I understand it&#x27;s a very personal decision to kinda ruin your life and be unable to support loved ones around you; that&#x27;s something only you can decide.<p>But if what&#x27;s holding you back is <i>&quot;duty to your country&quot;</i>, look to Ed Snowden.

They can <i>rent</i> servers from companies like Softlayer and Rackspace (#3 and #4 behind AWS for YC startups), or spin up much cheaper VPS&#x27;s (Linode&#x27;s #2). We&#x27;re talking $120/month commitments, not buying hardware and driving to a data center to install it. Deploying to a freshly imaged physical server is the same as deploying to EC2, and they can be provisioned for you in an hour or two. Each of those servers gets you many times the performance of an EC2 instance in the same price class, which means much more time to figure out your capacity needs as you grow.",1391457610

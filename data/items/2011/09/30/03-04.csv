Remote deposit being rolled out now.<p>You can't go wrong with any of the other banks either (ING and Schwab are great also), but Ally really has a nice offering.<p>Also, be careful when and where you use your debit card.<p>If someone gets a hold of your debit card info, they are accessing your cash directly.  With a credit card, they are creating a future liability (no cash out of your account).

3055606,comment,3054912,3055454,17,0,anamax,,,"> Bold regulation on banks and insurance companies is necessary.<p>What about bold regulation on the regulators and the politicians?  You remember them - they thought that subprime mortgages were a good idea, that everyone should own a house, so any bank that wouldn't play ball didn't get to play.<p>You remember Fannie and Freddie - they lied about the fraction of the market that was subprime, so everyone's risk calculations were wrong.<p>> Often the laws are written by the industry they're intended to police (cf. health insurance).<p>Actually, they're always written by the relevant industry.<p>> That's a horrible strategy.<p>However, like gravity, it's how things are.  Any plan that assumes otherwise is doomed.<p>> This sounds like a quote by Herbert Hoover. Contrary to history's view of him (which is intensely negative) he was a very intelligent and probably a good-hearted man. He, however, believed that there was absolutely nothing government could do to save the economy, and that letting the beginnings of the Great Depression go unchecked was the least evil action. He was wrong.<p>And, you're completely wrong.  Hoover tried stimulus after stimulus; he dramatically increased spending.  FDR actually campaigned against the spending and changed course upon taking office.<p>Both Hoover and FDR believed that the great depression was caused by excess production, so they both tried to restrict it.  FDR didn't give up until it became apparent that an ""arsenal of democracy"" had to actually produce lots of stuff.<p>This ""war on production"" is now credited with putting the ""Great"" in ""Great Depression"", that is, with making it last as long as it did.<p><a href=""http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonge...</a>",1317355087

He did come to a somewhat activist government in the second half of his term. Of course, his real but somewhat muted response to the Great Depression led FDR to attack him. But from the Right, using populist rhetoric about government debt and wasteful bureaucrats.<p>Hoover wasn't evil as you point out, but nor was he an ideologue who refused to choose the best policy because of prior beliefs. Believing that story line makes us blind to learning from his failings to better ourselves. To wit, his great vice wasn't lack of compassion or intellectual arrogance; it was simply a... lack of boldness.",1317355077

Only methods that are lableled async implement the new 'await'.<p>Some of the old .NET methods had 2 API's - synchronous & asyncrhonous. Some of the synchronous implementations, as pointed out in your link, have been deprecated.<p>A few of the async methods I have seen (which do not have Async in the title), only accept the old IAsync/callback and do not work with await. Presumably, they do not implement the new C#5 style of async yet. Hopefully, they will at some point, because I'm a big fan of how clean & readable async C# can be now.<p>Again I haven't explored C#5.0  thoroughly, these are just my first impressions.",1317354927

It was totally organic.<p>And it wasn't something my sister or her uncle had either the knowledge or the skills to do. I knew perl and shell scripting and had worked with Unix for some time. (Back before the Internet with 1 or two books on a machine that costs $40,000 that I paid for in 1980's dollars.

My point being that I didn't just wake up in the morning and buy a pack of gum and make money.<p>It's not like patent trolls because there are many possible names that someone can use for their business.

3055594,comment,3055154,3055154,106,0,ender7,,,"I've been tempted to write rants like this before. Ryan's point seems particularly centered around Unix, which makes sense. My experience of trying to get stuff done in Unix has taught me that it is a really powerful, extremely well-thought-out way to <i>waste my fucking time.</i><p>All of it. Down the fucking toilet, and for stuff I don't give a shit about. Every single goddamn thing I try to accomplish while setting up a server involves a minimum of 1 hour of googling and tinkering. Installing PHP? Did you install it the <i>right way</i>? Did you install the special packages that make it secure and not mastadon slow? You want to create a daemon process? Hope you found the right guide! Setting up a mail sever? Kill yourself.<p>For some people, this is not the case. They have spent multiple decades breathing in the Unix environment, and are quite good at guessing how the other guy probably designed his system. And they don't mind spending the majority of their productive hours tinkering with this stuff. But I don't have time. I don't care. I don't have time to read your 20-page manual/treatise on a utility that doesn't explain how to actually use the thing until page 17. I don't want to figure out why your project doesn't build on my machine because I'm missing some library that you need even though I have it installed but some bash variable isn't set and blah blah blah blah.<p>The problem with Unix is that it doesn't have a concept of a user. It was not designed that way. It was designed for the people who programmed it. Other pieces were designed for the people who programmed them. If you are using a piece that you built, then you are a user. Otherwise you are a troublesome interloper, and the system is simply waiting in a corner, wishing you would go away.<p>And yet...we put up with it. Because there isn't a better option. Because it's our job. Because we'd rather just bull through and get things done than spend an infinite amount of time fixing something that isn't fixable.

We only ever respond one way: by agglutinating more code with the old. Compound this a few times and you have irreversible complexity. It's what would happen in a neighborhood if you called garbage ""construction material"" and only ever piled it up all around you.<p>The solution is to delete nearly as much code as we write. Put differently, the solution is small programs, ruthlessly pursued. The reason we don't do this is that it's totally absent from (nearly all) software culture -- absent as in blank stares and why-you-talk-crazy-talk if you bring it up -- and by far the number one determinant of what people do is what other people do.<p>There are a few points of light. Chuck Moore and Arthur Whitney come to mind. From everything I've heard, their programs are small enough not to have these problems. And in case anyone is wondering ""If this is so much better how come we don't all work that way?"" - the answer to that conundrum hit me the other day: sample size.

(Any VCs out there want to discuss other ideas I'm working on?)<p>This kit look me about 6 months to put together, from prototyping the PCB to iterating over an enclosure design. Waiting for components to arrive in the mail (PCBs, laser-cut designs, resistors) was what took the most amount of time.<p>When I started, I was fully convinced that I would have a working product within just one or two iterations. Putting together a polished hardware kit (and I'd say that this has some degree of ""polish"" to it, though  far from perfect) is much more difficult and time-consuming than I would have ever imagined. Quite different from the agile! lean! iterate! that we talk about in software-land.<p>Oh. So I have 4 or 5 PCBs from the first few iterations. If you end up ordering one (and I encourage you to do so!) then send me an email and I can throw one in the box.

Despite having pumped six figures in deposits through them more than once over the course of having them as a bank BofA never treated me any better than if I were some junkie or drug dealer, it was a breath of fresh air to move to a bank that didn't treat me as if I were nothing more than a cow to be milked for fees.",1317351800

I found this out when I'd just moved country, had zero-credit, had a single $1000 visa card and was planning on putting a weekend away with my wife on credit so I'd have two pay checks in before I had to fork out the cash.<p>The worst was when we booked a campsite out of season. It cost us $14 a night and they required booking by credit card. They had $500 pre-authorized for over two weeks until we'd stayed, and I paid them cash. It's absolutely absurd.<p>Thankfully since the hotel incident we've always kept a burner credit card for things like this.

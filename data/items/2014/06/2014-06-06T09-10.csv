That network was designed [ages prior to this point] to have tiny, tiny, upstream channels for use by system control and maintenance devices, and huge downstream channels to shove 100+ analog TV channels. Because it would have cost a metric shitload to replace all of that hardware, the cable companies were forced to give their data subscribers pretty large downstream links and relatively meager upstream links.[0]<p>Frankly, the nerds of the day (remember, this is the mid-to-late 1990&#x27;s) would <i>all</i> have been running home servers, and would have been demanding a symmetric connection so that they would have a substantially cheaper alternative to ISDN.<p>(Note that nerds that remember those days consider asymmetric home Internet connections to have been more harmful than the Eternal September.)<p>[0] Note that this property is pretty meaningless in an HFC network where the cable company <i>could</i> run fiber directly to the home, but chooses not to.

It seems awfully slower than just cranking something out in jQuery but I will admit that something like JavascriptMVC looks rather nice.<p>Ideally I would like to avoid having to hunt down jQuery libraries by using one of these frameworks. For example, I am already relying on the following libraries:<p>LAB.js (because I discovered some edge case where things don&#x27;t load in order)<p>Cookie.js<p>Mustache.js<p>JSON3.js<p>These are rather great for displaying JSON data in a template with jQuery but I had to actively look for these things.",1390903145

These are also the <i>practical</i> capitals, in the sense of these cities containing their respective national governments and institutions.<p>Things only get thorny when you start trying to ask about what capitals are <i>recognized by other countries</i>.  Then you start getting nonsense answers, like the capital of Israel being in Tel-Aviv (then why isn&#x27;t the Knesset there?) and the capital of Palestine being nonexistent due to occupation (then where does the Palestinian Authority govern from?).<p>For legal and practical purposes, there are answers to these questions.  People are just embarrassed to contradict their own politics by speaking these answers aloud.  So if we&#x27;re talking about knowledge extraction, if I were Google, I would give the legal and practical answers.

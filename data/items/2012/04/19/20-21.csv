So about $120/customer. DropBox's valuation is around $5-$10bn, around 20-40x revenue. Which given their growth rate seems a reasonable revenue multiplier.<p>Over the same period Evernote made $18m from 750k paying customers (out of 20m users). So about $24/customer. A $1bn valuation would give a multiplier of 50x.<p>LinkedIn is currently trading at 45x revenue - a figure that's been relatively stable for a while.<p>So arguably 50x is high but not ridiculously so, if Evernote manages to double their customer base over the next couple of years (or their revenue per customer) which isn't unfeasible, it'll look cheap at that price.<p>(Given Evernote costs $45/year that presumably means most of their customers signed up relatively late in the year resulting in the average revenue per customer being $24/year, so even if they only managed to keep their current customers they'd make 34m this year bringing their multiplier down to 30x)",1334868467

Don't believe me? Try looking back at some of the /best lists in archive.org for politics, crime, or sports. They are there and it's the high rep Hners posting them. This is all about framing it right as long as you are seen in a favorable condition for framing the item.<p>So yeah, that's how it is. I am sure to expect a counter stating why this is on-topic, or how this one topic is rare etc etc. Framing. Frame shit well, anything looks like gold.<p>----<p>The backstory?

I can pull references all day.<p>If ever tried swearing here? Or giving a point against the masses? Downvoted right?

I assure you these work. I've experimented with them and have studied high rep members for months<p>* Circle jerk with reference, your point must inflate the previous point if not disagree with reference.<p>* Frame your shit. Follow the masters and their styling, they can make cooking a pasta HN worthy. It's amazing actually they really do have that bullshit making skill<p>* Bring in completely tangential points and references to counter anything written. The aim of the game is to disagree with just the right level of snark<p>* Never ask why HN is the way it is, this will only upset the hivemind, they don't like their emotions swayed.<p>* Attack YC companies, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, the community gets a kick out of this, they love seeing them fail and pointing how crappy they but never when those companies are busting their chops making something successful<p>* If you are really really really angry about something someone wrote, use a throwaway account this is <i>key</i>. HN regulars do this, all the time.<p>* Never interact with an HNer out of HN, not on twitter not on forums not on anywhere. The pseudonymity high they get off of being here makes them who they are. Don't take that away from them.<p>* Never comment on the original article (Cannot let the author know all the snark and non constructive criticism you leave them can you?)<p>* If you find a cool product on the internet that is not free, find a way to clone it in a weekend and put in on Github on rails and say ""Tell HN: This is my piss poor clone done over the weekend give me karma now""<p>pg once/twice/three times?/I lost count/ tried to fix this community but it's not fixable when the top community members fail to see they are full of themselves and imparting that notion to newcomers that this is how the conversation and behaviour must be.<p>You may ask, why am I still here? Well you see, after you get past the circle jerk inflated ego mindset, there is actually treasure in here. And that sucks. Love/hate relationship I tell you.<p>Did I once say frame your shit?<p>If you haven't already, would you mind reading about HN's approach to comments?",1334868248

Also, we think that the git push  deploy dance, is a bit too much when you want to make minor edits.<p>You realize this ""dance"" is solved by a simple post-receive hook right? For example:<p><pre><code>  git clone ${GIT_REPO} ${TMP}                                                                                               \n  ${HOME}/gems/bin/jekyll --safe --no-auto ${TMP} ${PUBLIC_WWW}                                 \n  rm -rf ${TMP}\n</code></pre>\nAny time you push to that repo, it builds and deploys the new site automatically.",1334865714

A developer creates a playback of only the 'interesting parts' of the code and provides a narrative about why they think it is interesting.<p>Then, when someone looks at some unfamiliar code they can search to see if there is a 'story' about that bit of code. The code and the narrative playback side by side. The noise can efficiently be bypassed.",1334865667

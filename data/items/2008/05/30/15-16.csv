I've thought about moving to a software version but I find the physical act of writing to be crucial to the process.<p>For a software to work for me, it would need certain features. I want wiki-like cross-referencing but don't want html output. Just text. I want to be able to edit in vim. Some basic formatting would be nice, and I want links to web sites to open in my browser. I want to be able to scan changes by date, to search through content, and to be able to view multiple entries at a single time. To-do lists are nice but I don't need a scheduler; I just need a place to keep track of current concerns. I want to integrate with my email, browser history, and IM logs.<p>Now that I list out the sorts of features I'd like to see, it looks like what I want is not just a single program.. it's a different way of interacting with my computer.",1212163115

204490,comment,204374,204374,0,0,gaius,,,"The answer to this is that it depends what their problem is. There is a lot of horizontal stuff that is applicable to any industry. You could get a lot of experience building (say) workflow software in one industry and reuse that knowledge in any industry. This is the classic systems analysis approach.<p>But if that industry uses software to solve problems directly, then you will need domain knowledge. You could be the best C programmer in the world, but without the domain knowledge all you could offer (say) a biotech company would be help in optimizing their code or writing generic functions such as the user interface or the data access. How could you write code to simulate protein folding without knowing it yourself?",1212162796

204487,comment,204374,204374,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I think you are asking a very important question for any entrepreneur which is ""how do I go about finding a substantial business opportunity upon which I could build a viable enterprise?""<p>Recently I wrote about ""entre-sumer"" which I believe is an important cornerstone for bootstrapping startups.  Basically I am arguing that we need to refine the ""Build Something People Want"" concept further by narrowing it to ""Build Something I want"".<p>That is, to maximize our chance for success, we need to be the ""entre""preneur who creates the solution and at the same time, be the con""sumer"" who has a burning need for such solution.<p>So in that sense, the Founders of Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, etc., were doing just that.  They were the representatives of their generation and they were the ""alpha"" dogs.  By eating their own dog food, their success is assured since by definition there are plenty of ""beta"" dogs who would follow.<p>But rather than saying that these are ""software-related"" opportunities, I would say that these are E2C opportunities, building an ""E""nterprise to sell to ""C""onsumers.<p>My own opinion is that while these are interesting and highly visible opportunities, they have the fundamental problem that more often than not, you will be competing with ""free"".  It is difficult if not impossible to get consumers to pay, however much they might live to depend on your products and services.  So typically the viable business model is advertising, i.e., monetizing eyeballs.<p>The other side of the coin, and I believe this is the gut of your question, is E2E, building an ""E""nterprise to sell to other ""E""nterprises.<p>Then the answer to your question is YES.  Someone in your team would need to come from that industry who can be the ""surrogate"" customer.<p>My experience with selling to enterprises is that customers are actually not the place you start when you build a company from scratch.  They know how to criticize an imperfect product but they have no idea what to do with a perfect PowerPoint.  You need to have someone inside your team who has the insights to guide your vision.  If that person is you, it is the best.<p>Hope this helps.",1212162737

For reference, ""Q for Mortals"" is a good read, and Joel at wagerlabs.com blogs about q/kdb+ occasionally.<p>q/kdb+ could turn into something really useful, and has some nice tricks, like very easy to use remoting capabilities, and a way to send lambdas to another machine anywhere and have that machine run the code. Unfortunately q/kdb+ are still a bit too domain specific to the finance world where the product apparently has a strong commercial following, so some of the stuff, like a robust, secure web server to compliment the powerful remoting capabilities is currently not available. Additionally, the language should have separate variable creation and setter operators, because it would be pretty easy to inadvertently start working with a new var after a mistype when an original var was intended.<p>If this stuff was cleaned up for consumption by a larger market, I think it would be pretty hot.",1212162623

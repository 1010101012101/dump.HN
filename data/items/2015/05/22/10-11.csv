Even in developing nations I think people are more likely to go with a dirt cheap Windows Phone when Windows 10 is out over a Firefox phone. One thing Windows Phone does really well is run great on very low powered devices. I can&#x27;t ever see Firefox OS getting above 0.x market share.<p>Perhaps Mozilla is just too big now? Do they need to scale back to save money? Can they survive on a donations alone?",1432292328

Unfortunately, this was probably inevitable, given that Mozilla was firmly in the &quot;Open Source&quot; camp. A lot of people like to complain about the strict ideological rigidity of RMS and the FSF. As we see here, without the foundation that is focused on the Free (as in speech) ideals and putting the user first, the &#x27;pragmatic&quot; decisions of Open Source allow it to be captured by popular faction.<p>The problem with this situation isn&#x27;t ads. It isn&#x27;t even the obvious privacy issues that end up being lampshaded with promises of anymization and servers that never get hacked or changed in future updates. The really damning thing about putting ads into Firefox is the conflicting incentives it introduces. Previously, Mozilla just had a cache problem. Now they have a slightly smaller cache problem and are financially dependent on advertisers.<p>When (not if) those advertisers request something more intrusive, is Mozilla prepared to give up that income source to protect their users? No, that&#x27;s the problem with paying the Dane-geld[1] - you never get rid of the Dane.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/dane_geld.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/dane_geld.html</a>",1432292140

With a few exceptions, open source projects tend to be consistently underfunded. I get the feeling the HN crowd doesn&#x27;t realize/appreciate/care about this fact.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at two contrasting open source projects: Ruby and the V8 Javascript interpreter. Ruby is dog slow in comparison to V8. They both languages are extremely dynamic and present similar optimization challenges. Why? Because Google has enough cash to hire world-class experts to make V8 f<i></i><i></i>ing fast. One of the guys behind V8 has <i>20 years of experience</i> with writing JITs for dynamic languages. The guy practically invited JITs for dynamic languages, and was also one of the main contributors of the Hotspot JVM JIT.<p>In contrast, Ruby does not. I met up with a panel of Ruby core developers a couple of months ago. It became extremely clear that Ruby is underfunded. Ruby has maybe 2 full time paid developers. They are skilled, but are nowhere near as skilled as the V8 guy when it comes to optimizing dynamic languages. They also lack funding for infrastructure projects.<p>Web browsers are one of the most complex pieces of software in human history. Mozilla literally spends millions per year on developing Firefox. Sure, a browser might exist in a completely free, lowly-funded FOSS form. But at what expense? Just look at Ruby vs V8. You can&#x27;t just hand-wave away the importance of money.",1432291681

I particularly like this nuance:<p><i>Growing food in a desert may seem nutty, but there are advantages. Frost, hail, and damaging rainstorms are far less common than they are in other parts of the country, and the growing season is year-round, as are the jobs. Last year, Brawley received a little over half its average annual rainfall on a single stormy day, August 21st, and other than that got just the odd sprinkle. Total reliance on irrigation is a drawback in one way, because the water has to come from somewhere, but the absence of rain is what makes precise planning possible: farmers in the Midwest don’t know to the day when they will harvest the corn they hope to plant next month (weather permitting).</i><p>As well - the fact that conservation, can actually be <i>negative</i> - this article is full of all sorts of nuance you can get when you let a writer actually spend time, and do the research:<p><i>Cox drove me past a field in which one of his employees was planting lettuce, and parked by another ditch. “This is some of our citrus, here,” he said. “It’s grapefruit. It’s been flood-irrigated in the past, but we’re switching it all to micro-sprinkler.” Doing that will reduce Cox’s water need, but it will also have the perverse efficiency effect that Bradley Udall described, by turning a non-consumptive use (irrigation runoff) into a consumptive one (more grapefruit). That’s an especially complicated issue in the Imperial Valley, because runoff from farms like Cox’s is the only source of water, other than modest amounts of rainfall and mountain runoff, for the Salton Sea, an immense but shrinking and increasingly threatened lake at the northern end of the valley.</i>",1432291066

I never really had the problem of pushing them instead of left/right, but I was annoyed at it at first because I couldn&#x27;t find PgUp/PgDown. After using it for a few months, I actually prefer that layout.<p>What annoyed me more was the swapping of ctrl/fn from my older model (Fn is at the leftmost now). I got used to that too, though I would still prefer ctrl on the left.<p>As for the keyboard itself, I preferred the pre-chiclet keyboard on the old thinkpads, but of the current-generation laptops I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s still the best one by miles.",1432289250

Doesn&#x27;t take a very big cache hit ratio before caching all external reads becomes profitable.<p>If cost is a consideration, it&#x27;s pretty rare for AWS to be the way to go for anything but batch processing where you need instances or short periods of time in the first place.",1432289095

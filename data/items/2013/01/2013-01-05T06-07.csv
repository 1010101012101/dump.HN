While we know a great deal about human physiology, it's still an equation that we have yet to solve. The systems of a cellphone (and the battery) are probably better understood, with less variables to account for.<p>Also, when the food at your local grocery store is completely replaced with GMO foods, you don't really end up with a choice in the matter. On the other hand, you still have a choice to get a cellphone or not (even in today's world).<p><pre><code>  | Bananas didn't evolve with ""being good for you 20 or

Are you saying that it's impossible for plants to end up having a cumulative effect on your body? For example, checkout this thread: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4494083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4494083</a>. Summary: Broccoli has mutagenic and anti-mutagenic properties, and in one study of fruit flies the mutagenic properties won out. What happens when GMO broccoli ends up further tipping this balance towards mutagenic? What happens when another food is engineered and tips the balance from the anti-mutagenic side (to the mutagenic side)?",1357368937

5011922,comment,5011619,5011795,4,0,jsnell,,,"It's totally reasonable for Google to decide they don't want to spend the resources to support WP8 due to low usage. But here they were taking an apparently already working (even if not officially supported) site and breaking it. That's a bit less reasonable, but it could admittedly still be a technical issue.<p>But that clearly can't be the case for the GMail and Youtube issues. Google still continues supporting the Exchange sync protocols for business users, so there's little technical benefit in disabling it for another class of users. Likewise Google is under no obligation to make a native WP8 Youtube app -- but given they've given partners API access to Youtube in the past, clearly there's no technical reason why they couldn't also open up the API for MS to use. In either case there's no plausible way the low market share of WP8 could be the explanation.<p>Now, of course both of these cases could have totally benign explanations. Maybe the licensing terms of ActiveSync make it undesirable for Google to support it for free users in the future. Perhaps MS and Google can't come to a reasonable agreement about Youtube API licensing terms, and the real villain of the story is MS for trying to now score cheap publicity points with it. Or maybe Google is trying its best to smother WP8 in the cradle. And you can't ignore these other data points when looking at the motivations for these petty Maps changes.",1357367935

You were right in that many companies have strict education requirements.  It may not limit you now at a younger age but once you are in your 30's or above and you start to be considered for management that's when the education requirements really kick in.  In many cases you may be in line for the management position but they simply cannot hire you due to internal policy.  That royally sucks.

In principle fun and gen use the machine stack for return addresses whilst proc uses a heap allocated list which allows cooperative multi-tasking using channels for communication: such so-called spaghetti stacks are easy to swap. Machine stacks can only be swapped in a conforming way in C/C++ by using pre-emptive threads which is precisely what we're trying to avoid.<p>I said ""entirely"" above because semantics and optimisation are heavily intertwined in any system.<p>The comment about ""syntactic sugar"" is valid: there are at least four operators with different precedences all meaning ""application of function to arguments"". However note that in most languages this is true anyhow: x + y is really just add (x,y). Finding a good set of squiggles and marks that's acceptable to many people isn't easy.<p>However the syntax is defined in the library, in user space, so you can add your own grammar or design your own domain specific sub-language, and add your favorite squiggles that way.

There are very few reasons to UA string sniff to determine functionality, and redirecting based on it is about as low as you can go on that axis.

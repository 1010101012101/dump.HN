I felt flattered as this article hammered home the importance of being up to date on tech, and employing the kinds of people that'll get great work done.<p>I've noticed a tendency, not just amongst others but also something I catch myself doing, for people like you and me to be a little over-sensitive. I spent a big period of my life being ridiculed over what I liked, and what I did, and what I looked like. I got used to confusing insults being thrown at me veiled under sarcasm, and felt like the whole world was laughing at me and I didn't even hear the joke.<p>So I got mean. I stopped trusting people, and I always assumed the worst. If someone (particularly someone matching the profile of former tormentors - bigger than me, cooler than me, better hair than me, plays sports better than me) said something that was maybe sincere, but possibly a sarcastic insult, I took it as the latter. These people were out to get me and if I gave them the benefit of the doubt, they would set me up for a fall!<p>Of course, the real world isn't high school, and more than that, the world has changed and attitudes have moved on. But any geek who is still carrying around a defensive attitude has turned the tables: now they are the ones judging others, being exclusionist (see: people crying about ""fake"" nerd girls), judging people on their appearances (many of us are anti-suit) or what they do (and many of us are anti-sports).<p>> self-content righteousness in making fun of those people who created everything modern society cannot be without: facebook, twitter, the internet, apps, you name it<p>On the one hand this sounds arrogant; I think as a developer I'd be remiss in not including many other people in the credits (product managers, finance, legal, designers, ux experts - many of these people are not nerds). On the other, whenever I speak to people about what I do (""What's a software engineer?"" ""I uh.. make websites"") the reception is generally positive and enthusiastic - most people acknowledge that they enjoy the fruits of technological development, appreciate the people that bring it to them, and often aspire to learn more of the inner workings.<p>Of course, there are some bad articles - but they aren't representative of people's opinions in the wider world, in my experience, and the number I read that are flattering versus insulting is improving all the time.",1353159599

By comparison, the Euro-like nations below Finland all cluster together.<p>For unknown reasons, Finland is special. Bringing up Finland is a bit disingenuous.<p>You could bring up more typical Euro nations, but unfortunately several of them get pretty decent outcomes with privatized school systems (e.g., Sweden).",1353157883

While a non-parliamentary approval-voting system would allow people to vote for a third party and also help elect their preferred major-party candidate.  That could sidestep the ""forming a government"" parliamentary negotiation process.<p>How that would actually look in practice, I'm not sure.  Would it actually help those third parties if they get votes but don't get elected?  Would third parties be able to ""extort"" major parties just by offering pre-election endorsements?  How many of those third party candidates would actually end up in the legislature?  I don't know if it's been tried at scale.",1353157502

I think they focus more on the people then the app. For example: how long have you guys worked together? How many times applied? I think the question about ""hacking the world"" plays a big part. As every founder knows, the application changes so much during development- that it's not really about the idea- it's about the parters. You need to have a history with your partners, you need to balance each other, you need to be creative and ""think outside the box""(hacking). Lastly you need to show previous success. If they're investing time, money, credibility into you - they want to see previous success to know you have the right drive and you are a ""winner"". Just my thoughts. Good luck on your application!",1353157385

I'm assumng this is a show HN (could be wrong), so if its critiques you'd like I'd say the #1 problem is the design and visual layout, the generic bootstrap is nice for quickly throwing ideas together but for an actual project where you want traction for me its kind of too unprofessional looking. Otherwise, great job though, I think from an idea and functionality perspective this is awesome, and I would be interested in helping out if you would like it :)",1353157213

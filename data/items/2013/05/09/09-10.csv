5679575,comment,5667606,5678975,2,0,mheathr,,,"Emacs could gain a lot of performance boosts with some significant changes to its architecture.  It would be a lot of work to do and doing so requires a set of skills that are much less available than other software engineering skills unfortunately.  I am hoping either that occurs or there exists a viable replacement for Emacs that incorporates the improvements more easily due to starting with a blank slate.<p>Proprietary programs are a deal breaker for me as far as contributing to them in my free time a great deal due to how frequent they go out of business and lose support.  So, a new iteration of Emacs would require a very free license for me to have confidence that my efforts won't be wasted in a short period later.<p>I am hoping that Light Table is released with a license and degree of openness that provides a similar degree of hackability as the Emacs platform does.  If that happens I think I will make a lot of effort to bring it up to speed with features Emacs has but Light Table doesn't at the time.<p>Chris Granger has made a lot of smart design decisions that really appeal to me about Light Table.  His point in one presentation that while Emacs and VIM are fantastic at text related operations, there doesn't exist something comparable that has both great support for text and great support for visualization.<p>That is a thought that really resonates with me.  Having fantastic graphing capabilities and embedding of graphic tools such that the work flow can exploit both graphics manipulations and text operations would be a huge boost in capabilities, something which adding to Emacs would be much harder due to so much legacy code in the platform that will have to be accommodated in the process.<p>As an example, people have really wanted to move Emacs underlying language from elisp to common lisp for a long time, but it is such a massive undertaking and transitioning the community to using it would be so difficult that (without a team to work on it constantly) no one has succeeded in doing so fully.<p>Light Table's decision to use any language which can compile to javascript as its backend and use node-webkit as its front end results in a lot of features that are free in the process that are very nice to have for tool building.<p>And Granger has made a point to customize the compilers for the languages it supports to glean even more information and manipulation of the languages in the process, something which I hope is kept up as its support expands.<p>I absolutely love its instarepl design that is motivated by his idea of real time debugging.  Combining that with Crockford's context or scope based coloring concept would be a massively useful feature set for development and tools to be able to exploit.  The scope based coloring isn't something that Light Table has already or something Granger has mentioned adding, but it is something I hope enthusiasts can add assuming the platform is sufficiently extensible.<p>Granger's earlier idea of breaking down the environment based on functions as the smallest unit of focus instead of a file is another brilliant design concept that will be available in the future (according to another presentation he did).<p>So, I am very excited about its potential as a replacement for Emacs that takes that idea and makes it even better based on adding modern developments, and Granger seems to really appreciate open source and has a willingness to contribute towards that.<p>So, I am hoping that somehow the Light Table team is able to both charge for the tool and make it fully extensible as well as remove the potential for abandonment of the platform to result in a volunteer's effort being wasted, such as fully porting SLIME (a very exceptional lisp development environment that emacs has) to Light Table as well as ESS (a statistics development environment which could benefit from more graphics potential being available) that emacs has.<p>I think Light Table will already be a killer app for REPL centric platforms by the 1.0 release, and languages which have excellent REPL support and debugging is what I mainly use already. Adding the other features I mentioned will make it unquestionably the new state of the art for that context.",1368093122

What's the legal status of the copy Dropbox have?<p>Dropbox say they encrypt my data when they store it on Amazon, what's the legal status of the encrypted copy on Amazon, and who'd be held responsible for that if it happens in a different jurisdiction to me and my original copy? What if Dropbox already has a copy and uses de-dupe to not bother storing my copy? What if I try-but-don't-end-up-uploading-thanks-to-dedup my legal-in-Australia copy from my laptop, then download a copy-of-something-I-never-uploaded to my iPad? What if that happened via WiFi sync instead of downloading the files from Dropbox/Amazon? Are the hashes of the files somehow ""THE PROPERTY"" of the author of the book they identify?<p>What If I'd dropped the Gatsby .mobi file into my BoxCryptor(EncFS) folder inside my Dropbox folder? Without my key, it's just random data that happens to be called ""TheGreatGatsby.mobi"". What if I'd saved in in a PGPDisk image stored in Dropbox - then it's just random data without even a questionable filename - it;s mathematically no different to /dev/random, somebody's encrypted pron collection, or wikileaks upcoming nations-state-embarrassing-drop.<p>What if I travel through the US with encrypted copies of Gatsby but don't decrypt them while I'm there? What if I ""delete"" any copies from devices I travel to the US with, but my OS leaves all the data on my disk and just removed the filesystem pointers? What if I did a dd bit-for-bit copy of that disk-with-deleted-but-still-recoverable copyright-in-the-US data? What if someone else who never knew the disk contained possibly-recoverable copyright encumbered data bit-for-bit copied the disk?<p>If the answers to the above depend on some status or location of the passwords or decryption keys, what are the further implications of that - does storing my keys/passwords in Dropbox put them and the encrypted data the protect into some particular jurisdiction? What if I store my 1Password encrypted password file on Dropbox? Does having my head cross the border into the US with the passwords/key inside it make a difference? Does it matter whether I'm carrying a device or memorycard/stick with the encrypted potentially copyrighted data on it, or does have the encryption key in my head to data stored ""in the cloud"" somehow matter?<p>Copyright law, at least as it's developed/evolved since Gutenberg, really wasn't written with the capabilities and edgecases of modern technology in mind. Judges are called upon to interpret century-old artistic-expression-as-a-physical-object copyright laws to modern sync and cache enabled technology much of which is considered obsolete withing half a decade - and they don't always have sane/sensible interpretations available to them. They've got an army of oblivious/self-entitled Game Of Thrones torrenting kiddies on one side, and an army of Prenda Law style vexatious litigants on the other.",1368093085

So there's no way to tell the patient beforehand that their care will cost x amount. In addition to this the customer often doesn't know what they want and has no basis for making an informed choice before seeing a doctor. This is fundamentally different than (for example) selling products in a supermarket where costs are known up front, shops can vary prices and quality, and people can shop around. So the benefits of patient choice of hospital and treatment etc are questionable.<p>Other countries spend far less using a single-payer system with comparable or better outcomes than the US according to the statistics on life expectancy and expenditure per capita on healthcare, so IMHO the US should have more and better regulation of the healthcare market, not less.

5679455,comment,5678116,5679044,12,0,nhaehnle,,,"The question is: Does fast trading provide a net positive to society?<p>Real investment decisions - as in, decisions of which factories to build, which products to develop, who to hire, and so on - are made on a time-scale of weeks or months. Having the stock market react on a sub-second time scale certainly has no effect at all on those decisions.<p>To gain some perspective, consider if trading operated on an hourly-auction type system. The stock price would react slower and in a different manner that it does today, and that could change the income distribution among traders. But honestly, why should anyone care?<p>When it comes down to it, there is no upside to trades going that fast to anyone outside of the myopic circle of professional traders. Even those professional traders only have an upside as long as they participate in a vicious arms race. However, there <i>are</i> downsides.<p>One downside that many people argue is that the resulting distribution of income is not just, because HST firms suck a revenue stream out of the economy without building anything real.<p>The more important downside (in my opinion) is that HST sucks intelligent people away from sectors of the economy where they would positively contribute by developing and improving directly useful technology.",1368090597

This is still a pretty young industry and historically, the demand for programmers has been pretty low.

Not only do the standards play a role in what is and is not cacheable by default, but browsers and (to some extent) users also play a role in deciding what is and is not cached.<p>>Why? And why would you get bonus points for making it 700kb or less? This isn't 1983. Worrying about bandwidth, memory, and processing power (in user space) is no longer relevant. Instead, worry about scalability, cross-platform compatibility, code practices, etc, etc.<p>Bandwidth matters. The Web is not South Korea. Even in the US, broadband penetration in only 68 percent: barely over two-thirds.<p>Processor power matters. The Web is not gaming rigs. With the death of Moore's Law and the rise of mobile, the average Web-enabled device's processing power is actually falling, not rising.<p>Memory matters.

NumberProxy was created to provide user-to-user privacy, meaning that if you call or text someone your primary number is not visible to the person you are communicating with and is not easily traceable. Full details can be found in our Terms of Service and Privacy policy, but these are the basics: Once a number expires or you manually toss it, its not easy for us to figure out much about you or your conversations, your associated phone number is removed from our active servers. We do keep backups of our data for 24 hours and should these records be subpoenaed, we will cooperate with law enforcement. NumberProxy is great if you are trying to protect your phone number from other people. If you are trying to protect your phone number or conversations from the police or equivalent, its probably best to seek another solution.",1368090013

3098552,comment,3097880,3098457,1,0,exDM69,,,"I would say that using a shared_ptr is going the wrong way. A shared_ptr is a reference counter pointer and as such as many shortcomings, such as not being able to do cyclic data structures, being slow, hard to make thread safe. They're also quite complicated and require knowledge of C++ destructors, copycons, RAII, etc to understand.<p>So, please, don't push shared_ptr as a magic one-size-fits all solution, especially to newbies. There's a reason why reference counting is not used everywhere.<p>With C++ you must remember that it's using pass-by-value semantics by default, which is very different from pass-by-reference semantics of other (syntactically similar) languages (like Java). Using shared_ptr's will not get rid of this fact and makes things even more complicated.<p>In fact, I have a very hard time to find _any_ use for shared_ptr's in my C++ projects. scoped_ptr's and ptr_containers have proven to be more useful.",1318341567

If the need for an additional server arises, I want to just start it and not matter about buying licenses and entering keys.<p>This is one of the main reasons, I prefer my infrastructure to be open source.<p>""But, open-core is also open source"", you might say, but none of these projects ever end up getting a good community behind them. Many talented people would not sign a CLA and they would not want to invest their time into something that's ""tainted"" by a ""better"" enterprise edition.<p>Also, often times, submitted patches would not get accepted because the submitted feature is conflicting with an enterprise-feature - maybe even just one that's planned for somewhere in the future.<p>So in the end most of these open-core projects are exclusively developed by the same people who do the enterprise version and have a vested interest in selling enterprise licenses, degrading the ""open"" edition to nothing more than a trial version.<p>I would hate to see this happen to nginx. Not because there are no open alternatives (there are), but because nginx is elegant, fun to work with, fast and, above all, stable.<p>Let's hope that a pure support-based revenue model is going to work out for them.<p>(edit: nginx is released under a very liberal license, so it's entirely thinkable that, nginx would be OpenSSH'd: OpenSSH AFAIR started as a fork of the last Free version of ssh.

You drive up a ramp and the robot is inside the ramp.<p>Regarding slightly degraded batteries, I think that's less of a concern.  You'd pay less for a less charged or capable battery (only fair).  There'd probably even be grades of batteries, like we have for gasoline (RON or octane).<p>Also, people seem to have no problem doing exactly this with propane tanks (in the USA) for their BBQ grills.  The tanks you exchange are definitely not as nice as the ones you can buy new and get filled but the convenience of being able to exchange a tank outweighs a lot of people's desire to get their tank refilled.  You can always get your tank refilled, even if you previously exchanged it, you're not required to only exchange them.  Same exact business model as exchangeable batteries.<p>The exchange system (or fast charge) is simply for longer trips exceeding battery range or when you weren't able to recharge enough at home.  Curb-side parking spot chargers don't do anything different than in-home chargers, they're still slow and still don't solve the ""I want to go further than my battery"" problem.<p>Fast chargers, if used sparingly, could work.  It's overuse of it that's the problem.  I guess it all depends on how often people are using them.  The one worry I'd think is that people won't install a home charger ($2k or so investment) but will rely upon the fast chargers or exchange systems as they do now for gasoline.  If you're fast charging every other day or even twice a week, that's not good.",1318340419

I've spent years at this for the JS standard. It's part of the inevitable commoditization you cite.<p>Also, going back to 2006 or so when I invited pre-Google Alex Russell and other JS hackers to Ecma TC39 meetings, Mozillans including yours truly have tried to open up the standards process. Mozilla, Opera, and Apple co-founded the WHATWG and set up an open membership structure for it in 2004, to create HTML5. W3C finally relented and internalized much of that structure.<p>So alleging that ""Mozilla"" is trying to keep the old boy's club closed is simply false.<p>I've cited hard, in some cases physical (as in physics) reasons for why there won't be a lower-level bytecode standard for browser-based VMs any time soon.

Mozilla has no control other than what users of our software delegate to us by trusting us enough to download and run our stuff.

Baltimore in many ways had three-way segregation -- black, white, and Jewish -- with Realtors for all three communities refusing to show houses in the ""wrong"" neighborhood to anyone.  However, the public school system only had two-way segregation -- black and white, with Jews attending white schools.<p>Johns Hopkins, then as now an elite institution located in Baltimore, encouraged local kids to apply, and was integrated long before the public schools were.  Hopkins never had any kind of restriction on the number of black students, but they <i>did</i> have quotas on the number of Jews.  That's because the black school system was bad enough (and blacks generally financially disadvantaged enough) that they knew they'd never have more than about 5 percent or so of their student body being black -- enough to show that they were liberal and enlightened, but not enough to change the character of the student body.  But if they let in all the Jews who qualified, the school would be half Jewish, which would be unacceptable, as they'd get a reputation as a ""Jewish"" school.<p>This is also one of the reasons for the long-ago heyday of City College in New York: as a public college, they didn't discriminate, and so a lot of Jewish kids who would have otherwise qualified to go to the Ivy League ended up there.",1318338068

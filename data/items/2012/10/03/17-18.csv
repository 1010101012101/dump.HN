I would suggest taking all versions of the page and signup methods to test usability of the product. Optimizing on the initial signup is great, but if your users don't use the product after they signup bc it's so vague.. then you've just wasted all that optimization effort. Unless the goal is to create a huge list of signups.<p>Also, where is traffic coming from? Paid, organic search, social media, press release, tc, etc? That has a huge difference on your results. And what tools are you using to run the tests and what is the sample size? I think readers would love to hear those tidbits too<p>Thanks for sharing your findings.. good luck =)",1349287104

In fact, they flatly reject such relationships.<p>Nor is being a criminal remotely causally linked to being black, the way being ignorant of straight white male privilege is almost (again: almost tautologically) causally linked to being a straight white man, or the way being a 'mansplainer' is almost causally linked to mansplaining. [1]<p>[1] To state it more explicitly: you can't likely grow up mansplaining and reach maturity without having the tendency pointed out to you if you're not a man. Because our cultural baggage is that women defer to men and thus face more scrutiny/skepticism/criticism than men when they do disagree.<p>So even if we assume that everyone starts off equally likely to be a 'mansplainer' by mere chance, the female mansplainers are overwhelmingly going to have that tendency pointed out, challenged and be made aware of it.<p>Mansplaining adults will, thus, be almost entirely men because of said cultural baggage.<p>Similarly, it's pretty much impossible to grow up and reach maturity ignorant of remaining straight white male privilege in the US unless you happen to be a straight white male.  If we again assume that the tendency to be 'blind' to remaining racism/sexism/homophobia is randomly distributed, only those with that 'blindness' who are  straight/white/males are likely to reach maturity without having encountered situations that made it impossible to remain ignorant of such remaining tensions.<p>Applying the same considerations: if we assume the tendency to commit crimes is evenly/randomly distributed at birth, there's no evidence that non-black would-be criminals overwhelmingly receive some life experience that steers them away from crime. To the contrary we find that white would-be criminals are much more likely to have life experiences that result in the crimes they do commit being <i>excused</i> or <i>ignored</i>.<p>So not only is there no evidence that being black makes you more likely to commit crime, there <i>is</i> evidence that being white makes you far less likely to be charged, prosecuted and found guilty.<p>That is: a black person is no more likely to commit crime, refuting the assertion, <i>and</i> they have the deck stacked against them, meaning that asserting such a link is not only wholly unfounded by the data, but it takes a further act of white privilege to ignore the existence of the stacked deck.",1349286821

Some points that I'm taking the liberty of clarifying or adding some information:<p><i>>A student can apply for as many as 75 companies</i><p>This is the case for students majoring in the humanities. Engineers typically tend to apply to fewer (15 or so). Some of them rely on corporate connection between the lab/school and a company to get a leg-in on the process.<p><i>>you beg to your parents to fund you through your master and you then try again once you are done with your master (if they are rich enough, it isn't cheap and same thing goes for Ph.D.;s)</i><p>It should be noted that PhD candidates must pay tuition, much like a Master's student. A PhD also makes it <i>more difficult</i> to find a job.<p><i>>the only successful Japanese start-up that I can think of that has gone big in the last 20 years or so is Rakuten</i><p>GREE and DeNA (social gaming companies) are the other big ones. I'm kind of impressed with kakaku.com too (a price-comparison site for retail goods).<p><i>>but the way foreigners fit into this whole mess is that we, to a large extent, are exempted from this honour system. </i><p>I think that one of the main reasons why the status quo is so impenetrable is precisely because of the racial and cultural homogeneity of the country. I presume you are in Tokyo, where the culture is at least somewhat mitigated by the presence of foreign nationals and their foreign employees, but as I'm sure you know, things get pretty monotonic when you step out into the other major cities.",1349286756

First off, it's untrue that nobody else had the software expertise to challenge Apple: there's Microsoft, RIM, Palm, plenty others in 2007. Apple had 1% of the market and no monopoly. But let's pretend that none of that is true and that Apple did come to dominate the market. The dependence was mutual, and Apple would have every reason to fear dependence on Google as visa versa. This should have rationally encouraged cooperation. Apple's only alternative for search and web services would have been Microsoft, <i>even more</i> of a direct competitor (then, in 2007), and one to both Apple and Google at that! Undesirable.<p>Second, Google's handing out bullets to its competitors like candy and is hurting its ability to lock down mobile. In China, Baidu has ripped out core Google services from Android and has replaced it with Baidu services. Amazon has done the same thing for Fire and replaced Google with Bing. If Facebook were to ever build a phone, it wouldn't have to look much farther than Android. And of course Google on iOS isn't long for this world.<p>Third, the dependence on a single dominant player still exists. Samsung owns the Android space and can hold Google integration hostage for all kinds of goodies. It's pretty much back to square one re: Apple, except Samsung has OS alternatives (including forking Android [hey, who made S Voice?]), where Apple didn't have Google alternatives. HTC is in the dumps and Google is in a tough spot with privileging Motorola, its new baby, for fear of angering aforementioned Samsung.<p>So no, in short, it's not clear at all to me that this was a rational move.",1349286097

You have deviated from the true path, which is to secure employment in the ""job hunting"" period, which lasts for about two years leading up to your graduation as a bachelor or a master student (Ph.D. is generally a different story, so let's save that for a different time).<p>This job hunting involves an initial one year of ""getting to know"" (the companies do take attendance) each company at seminars and events. You register at their websites and attend in your own spare time. Schools try their best to respect this and are not as hard on the students during these years. Hordes of students dressed in suits (mind you, there is one kind of correct suit for this, well, one, depending on your gender) try their best to learn about the company and their goals, because this step is the preparation for the second stage. The second stage is filing applications, we are now somewhere between 1 1/2 and 1 year prior to graduation. A student can apply for as many as 75 companies, the reason for this will soon become clear, the failure rate is high and so are the stakes. At this stage the student has some idea of what he or she wants to do, but they will apply for anything they can consider okay. Each company has a different time when they accept applications and then go through three, four, maybe even nine steps of tests, interviews, group interviews and procedures (public sector jobs usually has an exam with questions from history and English to IQ-testing, you need to pass to get to the next stage). Once a student gets past these steps, they get an offer and are faced with the choice of accepting it or maybe to wait since their dream job may not even have started accepting applications yet. Once you enter the company you may very well receive training that is very different from your educational background, you are now ""one of the family"", for life, but that is a different story, let's get back to the start-ups.<p>Now, how does all this play into the start-up scene? Well, the one correct way to go through job hunting is when you are about to graduate. Some students fail to get a job, if you are a bachelor (this I am told holds especially true in science and engineering), you beg to your parents to fund you through your master and you then try again once you are done with your master (if they are rich enough, it isn't cheap and same thing goes for Ph.D.;s). Being outside the system for a year without a very good reason, such as interning abroad, will label you as an outcast, making it difficult to reenter the system. The same, of course, holds for those that try and fail to take part in a start-up. This creates an enormous disincentive to take risks and I think plays a major role in why the only successful Japanese start-up that I can think of that has gone big in the last 20 years or so is Rakuten. I can't blame students for simply asking, ""Why should I take the risk? Why should I build the companies of the future?"".<p>This is turning into a speech (maybe I am entitled?), but the way foreigners fit into this whole mess is that we, to a large extent, are exempted from this honour system. We are not expected to ""understand"" the correct way and can more easily jump between companies and most of the smaller start-up;ish companies I know in Tokyo are at least 50% foreigners (I think I may be a bit biased here). What I suspect is the attraction for foreigners is the culture and the challenge, maybe also the good (and diligent) labour. I think it was Bertrand Russel that said that Japan doesn't move ahead at a continuous pace but rather by skipping ahead after a major collapse of the foundations of its society. The Meiji Restoration and the end of WWII springs to mind. Only then has it been demonstrated that the old ways have failed and there is a climate where innovation can take place on a grand scale and companies and society can be resown. On a personal note, I hope that it won't have to be quite so dramatic, but the whole situation surely is problematic although getting better and better over the short amount of time I have been here.<p>If you got all the way to the end, thanks for staying with me. Having been in Japan for a few years now I tend to reflect upon these things. The above opinions are of course biased by my own limited understanding of things, I am an amateur at best, but maybe they can prove useful.",1349285878

4608602,comment,4607423,4607891,8,0,rogerbinns,,,"There is a fundamental difference between well written Android applications and iOS ones.  iOS apps are expected to run as an island.  Everything they want to do should be included into the binary.  There is essentially one entry point (a main() equivalent).  Think of it like a statically linked binary (which it mostly is).<p>Well written Android applications are structured like mashups.  There is no main.  There are multiple entry points for screens (aka Activities) as well as entry points for processing (Services), data (ContentProviders) and even a mechanism (BroadcastReceiver) for telling all interested apps about events (eg battery charge level changing, incoming calls, apps being installed).  There is a mechanism for decoupled communication (Intents) which allow specification of a verb (eg VIEW, PICK, DIAL, EDIT) and one or more bits of accompanying data (eg text, urls, images).  It is trivial to bring up/use part of another app that didn't even exist at the time yours was released and have the experience combined.  (You can always tell iOS apps ported to Android because they don't do mashups or collaborate with the apps already on your system.)<p>This means that an iOS app will never be improved by other apps installed on the system, while Android ones can be.  And because of Intents it becomes possible for a user to choose their own experience - want to use a different browser or app for viewing images?  No problem.  For example I installed the GitHub app on Android and it added itself to the AccountManager.  Now other apps can collaborate with it (eg it supports the SEND verb which creates a Gist) or ask it to display an issue/user/commit.<p>The (long winded) point behind this is that app installations are <i>far</i> more valuable to Android users.  If things were only decided on technical merit then Android will end up nailing iOS because of this.  But that walled garden sure looks nice to many people, and it is rare for users to really notice what is going on and they definitely won't have both devices to continually contrast and compare.",1349285787

So we have a good situation in which we can take our time to refactor the code and make the final transition when we feel it's ready.<p>On the other hand, the OP conflates changes in the language with changes in the applications built with it, which is an error. The Python community is very happy using the language in projects with cutting edge features and uses. You have to look further than just Django, at Scipy or Biopython in order to see that.

4608569,comment,4606610,4607991,2,0,saalweachter,,,"Eh, I'm not worried about demographics in my lifetime.<p>The birthrate declines in industrialized nations are only a problem if you're an optimistic xenophobe and imagine that borders are going to stay shut.  The younger end of the workforce in industrialized nations will be taken over by immigrants from countries with exploding birthrates like Africa or India, and the dreaded population implosion won't happen.<p>Maybe another N decades later once countries with exploding birthrates sort their shit out we might be at risk of an upside-down pyramid, but I think it's just as likely that we'll gradually oscillate around the replacement birthrate until we reach a comfortable steady-state population.<p>Once we hit steady state population, I think we'll be fine.  Assuming we don't back-slide on industrialization (say, if post-peak fossil fuels make everything prohibitively expensive), we're already massively over-supplied on labor.  Despite its far-below-replacement birthrates and a hearty helping of xenophobia, Europe's suffering from a demand crisis, not a labor crisis.  The US peaked at a 63% employment ratio, pre-crash.  I don't have the slightest doubt that we could maintain a pretty nice civilization with an employment ratio of 40%.  I wouldn't be surprised if a 25% employment ratio is doable with the right social infrastructure to allocate resources.<p>As long as there is enough labor, it's all just bizarre math.  Say in 2050 the total personal income in the US is $27 trillion in 2012 dollars (2% yearly growth above inflation from today).  The population of the US has grown to about 400 million (assuming a 0.9% growth rate, it'd be 437 million, but 400 million is nice and round).  With a 25% employment ratio, that $27 trillion gets divided 100 million ways, so the average income in 2050 would be $270,000 in 2012 dollars.  Right now the average income is about $70,000.<p>Now to tax it.  Right now the total US government tax revenues are about $5 trillion.  We're running a helluva deficit, so let's add another $1 trillion for a balanced budget.  Apply the same 2%-above-inflation growth as we did for income, and the US tax revenues in 2050 should be about $12.7 trillion in 2012 dollars.  There are also more people on the dole, so let's increase the budget by another 50%, to $19 trillion, and the average tax burden in 2050 is $190,000 / (working) person.<p>End result, the total tax rate in 2050 is about 70%, compared to a tax rate of about 38% in the US now.  After-tax income in 2050 is $80,000 / person, after-tax income in 2012 is $43,000 / person.

This is massive inflation and definitely has an effect on the currency.<p>No one really knows what the effect of halving of the mining rate will be.  The currency is young, relatively small, and not yet very efficient (from an economic standpoint).  However, everyone know the event is coming up.  It MAY already be priced in.  We won't know until the end of the year.<p>There is a small risk that this event may cause some disruptions in the underlying bitcoin infrastructure, however.  The idea goes: Many miners are running full tilt going into the event.  They know their income will half, so they want to get as much out of mining as possible before it happens.  This drives up the difficultly level.<p>After the event, many of these miners may drop off as their operations suddenly become unprofitable (they are already running at the edge of profitability by revenue per kilowatt hour metrics).<p>When the miners drop off, it takes some time for the difficulty level to adjust (up to two weeks).  Before the difficulty level adjusts, the time between transaction blocks will begin to grow, which slows down the confirmation of transactions.  In a worse case scenario where a large volume of processing power leaves the network simultaneously, it could take several hours to get transactions confirmed for a few weeks after the event.\nWill this actually matter, or even be noticed?  Again, noone knows for sure.",1349284713

Why isn't this another ""competition is good""?<p>Apple is not playing unfairly here (as you might argue in other battles, such as with Samsung), and neither is Google. They are competitors, and both Maps and Voice/Siri are key functionality for these mobile devices: Google spent a bunch of time building their technologies, and if Apple wants to use it on their highly profitable hardware maybe they should have to pay a <i>lot</i> for it; example: half their margin.<p>This is, then, what competition is: it is two people/companies duplicating effort to get a similar result, purposely putting each other down whenever possible, and setting up situations where they have whatever advantages the system allows over the other. The customer <i>often</i> loses in these situations, because so much blood and sweat has to be lost to the ""fight"".<p>The alternative, ""cooperation"", normally is frowned on in these circles. Even in the aforementioned cases of open source projects, such as the with web browsers (where the cost is painful fragmentation caused by some vendors misunderstanding or not disliking specifications enough to not bother implementing them) or compilers (the gcc/clang split has been brutal: clang doesn't really compile things correctly, and yet is now the only compiler from Apple for Mac OS X), people are again all ""competition is good, deal with it"".<p>Well, sometimes, often, possibly always (yes, even for the restricted domain of ""prices"" and even when cooperation includes ""trusts"", at least apparently according to Judge Posner; however you certainly needent go that far with this argument): ""cooperation is better, yielding a more powerful result for less development cost""; this is, after all, the premise of open source collaboration.",1349283836

If we continue the historical trend, this century will see no more than a few million killed in wars. You can always cherry-pick. Look up Steven Pinker, who is convinced that global violence is the lowest it's ever been...<p>While deaths in wars post 1950 might be much smaller, it's still far from insignificant. Are we content that millions of lives are disposable?<p>It's possibly worth pointing out that of the post 1950 wars, a significant portion of them have been perpetrated by the US and it's allies, who have not yet been held to account for their crimes.<p>> There's an enormous growing middle class in Asia and Africa that begs to differ...<p>Don't just look what's happening, but ask why. The growing middle class in Asia is due to the demand created by our outsourcing of manufacturing to there, along with the growing Asian based industries. They're given more opportunities to work. Not coincidentally, this coincides with the growing unemployment and poverty in the US and Europe. It's more economical to hire Asian labour than western labour.<p>But with the improvements in the physical and cognitive capabilities of computers/robots, it won't be long before that huge demand that brought work to Asia is replaced by machines.

Many projects have development workflows where new features are developed in branches, and only merged when they're ready to be deployed.""<p>Features, exportables, Strongarm (et al) are all compatible with the workflow you're describing. Our development workflow is heavily dependent upon branching. All new feature development takes place in branches that are later merged into dev, with stable ""snapshots"" taken from dev whenever we do a release. Pretty standard stuff, and we use features and installation profiles heavily in our implementation work.<p>""Suppose, in a Drupal project, you had two such features being developed simultaneously, and each added different new fields to a given content type, with corresponding changes to views and authorship workflows.""<p>What you're describing isn't a credible workflow, it's a mess. Field declarations for a single content type strewn across multiple features? Why? Designing a content type and exporting it to code shouldn't take more than 30 minutes for even the most complex content types. If additional features are required they can be added to the feature but separation of concerns typically dictates that that code goes into a separate module. Cleaner that way.<p>""ssuming it were even practical for each developer on a Drupal project to have their own development instance of the database powering a site (which it totally isn't)""<p>All of our developers maintain local mirrors of the dev environments for all of the clients they work with. This includes snapshots of the dev database. Also, how is maintaining a local copy of a database either impractical or in any way a Drupal-specific problem? Any project that includes a datastore is going to have similar issues.<p>""The exported blobs are pretty much opaque to many Drupal developers (or non-developers, as you say), though, and may not be expressed sufficiently sanely that Git could figure out what changes actually took places. When these features were ready to be merged, would the merge work? Who knows? What if there were merge conflicts? Would developers be able to resolve them? Worse, what if Git's notion of the correct merge strategy didn't actually produce a semantically correct result?""<p>Merge conflicts happen with any workflow. Merge uncertainty is an issue with revision control, regardless of what platform you're developing in. As far as manual merges goes, I submit that any developer should be capable of manually merging simple array declarations (because that's all exportables are).<p>""All of these operations take place on generated code that nobody wrote and nobody reads, which is scary enough that the whole process wouldn't be trustworthy.""<p>I think our definitions of both ""code"" and ""trustworthy"" differ greatly. Exportables aren't huge blocks of opaque logic. They're simple associative arrays. I have no problem trusting code that generates array declarations and has been tested by the core project devs, security team, module maintainers, and several thousand developers on tens of thousands of websites. Your mileage may vary.<p>""Exportables are yet another in a long series of efforts in the Drupal community to attempt to address a deficit they have with respect to most other web stacks, and again they've done it in a way that doesn't really deliver the benefits of the feature as it exists elsewhere""<p>100% accurate, you'll get no argument from me here.<p>""database abstraction layer""<p>My kneejerk reaction when this was first announced: DBTNG is a fucking travesty foisted onto the community by Acquia as part of a corporate play for the ""enterprise"" market. After a year of screwing around with it: It still a pain in the ass but with all of the bullshit going on with the MySQL project courtesy of Oracle, this might turn out to be very very useful.<p>""object-oriented design""<p>Who claimed Drupal was object oriented?

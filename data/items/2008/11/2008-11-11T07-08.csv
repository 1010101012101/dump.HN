360353,comment,360117,360287,0,0,delackner,,,"""you probably can't distinguish the meat of a free-range cow from one that ate nothing but corn""<p>This is incorrect.  Antibiotics, growth hormones, all of that doesn't just disappear from the cow's bloodstream the instant it dies.  Just one simple delivery mechanism: Meat is muscle tissue.  It is full of blood.  Blood carries the various drugs that the cow has been pumped full of to deal with eating corn.  You EAT that blood when you eat the meat.  Now, certainly some chemicals change when the meat is cooked, but they don't all disappear, nor do they necessarily change into something harmless.  Some chemicals may become (more) toxic after being cooked.",1226390197

360348,comment,360125,360125,0,0,unalone,,,"""Startup founder skills?"" Are there such things? If you look at it one way, pretty much any skill can be a ""founder skill"" if you use it right.<p>I've been working out, if that counts as practicing. I like being able to look at my body and feel a measure of pride in it. And absolutely, if you look good, it influences how other people think of you. I've also been trying to write music: mostly classical-inspired pop. I'm not very good at it, but it gives me something to fiddle with.<p>If I could say some things that aren't current, though, my two big ones are acting and Dungeon Mastering.<p>Acting, because it teaches you to become comfortable with your body, your voice, and with other people: you learn much more about your relationship with other things. It teaches you both about how you interact with yourself and about how you can change yourself to get a reaction in other people. Also, because the clich√© is true: there's no people like show people. They've vivid and fast and alive, and there's no sort of person I'd rather be with on a boring do-nothing day.<p>Dungeon Mastering, because it forces you to think. You're dealing with an extremely complex system, you're dealing with four-ish other people who each often know all the rules pertaining to them, and you're dealing with a world that you have to create yourself. Being a good DM means you learn how to handle complex systems and how to innovate within said systems. You need to balance four people at once and keep them all constantly entertained. It requires years of reading and - most likely - years of practice afterwards, but it's profoundly satisfying once you can do it. And D&D players are unique in that any group of players is playing because they love the game. You don't do it as a social move, or as a career move. You very rarely do it to pick up girls. It means you're with people who genuinely love what they do.<p>(I'd also recommend working out, if you haven't tried it before, because it's an excellent way of calming your mind, and because you really have to focus to get it to work.)",1226390003

360344,comment,360233,360233,0,0,lacker,,,"If you contact someone at Yahoo, the response will be, do not scrape us in any way.<p>The problem with financial data is that Yahoo (like most other sites where you might find this data) doesn't generate this data themselves. They license it from other companies, and the licensing agreement typically prohibits or greatly restricts Yahoo's ability to provide the data to third parties.<p>That said, if Yahoo is not aware that you are scraping them, they cannot stop you. They certainly do have anti-scraper algorithms (you will start getting http 999 errors) but they will not kick in until you cross some invisible threshold. You can probably use Tor with no problem.<p>Although, if you get large enough that someone notices, you will probably get some sort of cease & desist letter.

360339,comment,359864,360202,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"To some extent, actually, yes.  Here's a way of doing it.<p>Let us say that a hyper-advanced civilization has the ability, through simulations or otherwise, of calculating the odds of life arising in a universe with given initial conditions and fundamental constants (to some rough accuracy).  They can test billions of possible initial states, including our own, and use that to see whether we lie in a very probable location in phase space or an improbable one.  If the location is probable, it strongly supports the multiverse theory.<p>If the location is improbable, the theory is likely false.  For example, if the average probability of life arising in a given universe in some chunk of phase space that includes ours is 40%, and ours is in a subsection of that phase space with a 30% probability, the multiverse theory is not falsified.  If ours is in a subsection of that phase space with a 0.000001% probability (far lower than average), it suggests that multiverse is unlikely, because our existence seems to be in violation of pure chance.<p>The same method can be used to falsify evolution.  Test billions of simulations of the Earth's development of life, and see where our species falls statistically.  If we're in a probable area of the phase space (phase space of possible sentient creatures to evolve), our understanding of evolution is likely correct, and if we're in a very improbable area (many many standard deviations away from the most likely), our understanding must be flawed somewhere.",1226389205

He's had failures that would wash up most of us. Meanwhile, he gets better and better, while others give up.<p>I agree that not everybody can ""remove everything but the essentials"" - but I think that everybody can try to do it; can practice it. The difficulty is in knowing what the essentials are, which requires knowing what you are really doing, and what it needs. Through practice, we improve.<p>Could it be as simple as believing in your intuition? I mean: to consider what you believe is essential, and then act on it And find out if you were right or not. Then repeat many times. Without loss of enthusiasm...",1226389073

Later you are sued and lose a 10M lawsuit wiping out all of the assets in your business and then some. If you have a corporation your personal assets are normally protected from this loss.

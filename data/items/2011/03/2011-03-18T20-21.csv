2341949,comment,2339881,2339881,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Side comment, but perhaps an important one:<p>""it is generating revenue & profit, a couple of hundreds a month. Enough for me to cover my hosting expensives, and working less hours at my day job.""<p>It is generating revenue, it is <i>not</i> generating profit. This may seem like a subtle point, but it really isn't. Take the amount of money you make in your 'day' job, add in all the benefits your day job has as well (paid vacation? health care? life insurance?)<p>You mentioned your wife doesn't want to work at this business, so treat it like a one-person shop. Next you've got a hosting service, do you host on a virtual host? or do you have your own equipment? One of the nice things about things like EC2 and their ilk is that it aggregates a lot of operational costs that you can then consider in bulk (no need to depreciate equipment for example). Presumably you have your own computer (or computers) that you do development on, those you should depreciate because you will replace them as needed.<p>Take all the money you make from this service, and put that on top. That is your 'top line' revenue. Now take all of these costs operational (hosting), local equipment, your salary, your benefits and that becomes your 'burn' rate or recurring expense. Subtract them from the top line. The ratio of that number (the difference between revenue and cost) and your total revenue is your gross margin. Obviously if its negative you don't have any gross margin.<p>But if it is negative (and I suspect it will be) work backwards and make revenue a variable 'x' and your gross margin say ""20%"" Solving for x says your revenue has to be 20% higher than the sum of your costs to maintain a gross margin of 20%.<p>Now look at your customers, if you have N customers and you charge them x/N Euros per year, will they still use your service? If the answer is ""no"" then work that one backwards as well, if your N customers are too few, for what n will the price per n be low enough to meet your revenue and margin goal of 20%?<p>Lets say you figure out that you need another 1000 customers to meet your goals, do a sanity check and ask ""Is there really a thousand additional people who might use my service?"" If so then you need to reach them, so try to figure out what it will cost to ""talk"" to them (this takes various forms, going to a trade show where likely customers would go, advertising in a magazine or on a web site where likely customers would be reading/visiting Etc.) How many do you have to talk to before one signs up? One for one? One out of ten? out of twenty?<p>Anyway, you get the point. Running it as a business is very different than running it as a hobby. I was trying to give you a sense of what you might think about in your question ""What next?"" to see if you wanted to make your hobby into a business. This can be a winning strategy, if the business is sound, because you already you know doing it is fun (since you started doing it with no expectation of return). Of course you may also find that trying to make a viable business out of it takes all the fun out, and that would be a bad thing.",1300481858

That causes VCs who are concerned about satisfying their LPs to also care about fund IRR and liquidity.<p>Sometimes, there is a tradeoff between liquidity and IRR. Groupon could have sold for $6bn, or perhaps they could IPO at $15bn. There, the board members decided that the prospect of improved IRR exceeded the delay in liquidity.<p>It's not an accurate representation to state that VCs only care about liquidity when a company isn't going anywhere: given that it's a tradeoff, and that liquidity has heightened importance the older the fund, VCs will push for liquidity even in investments in companies that are certainly doing better than ""not going anywhere"".

The ReactOS userland, however, is provided primarily by WINE. You can think of ReactOS primarily as an open kernel compatible with Windows's kernel API, and WINE as an open userland compatible with Windows's userland APIs. ReactOS isn't rewriting WINE, they use WINE extensively. The main unique work of ReactOS is the Windows-compatible kernel.<p>Mono is helpful for pure .NET directly from a Unix environment. However, Mono is more of an open .NET development environment than a .NET compatibility environment; while Mono can run a lot of .NET apps that are made for Windows, that's almost incidental of compatibility with the CLR bytecode. There are important implementation differences that Mono is aware of and has no intention to correct because, unlike WINE, Mono is not really a compatibility layer.<p>Additionally, many Windows programs launch .NET programs directly, and afaik it's not very easy to get them to use Mono by default. For instance, I recently purchased C&C 4 on Steam, but it's a pain to make it work because circumventing the .NET-based launcher wants me to include an EA ID (I could use a fake auth server but just don't feel like putting that much effort in), and launching directly doesn't work because of the .NET-based launcher (.NET doesn't work). Further, more and more products are relying on .NET components, including Visual Studio, Office, and other big things. I think getting the .NET runtimes working well should be one of the main goals for WINE devs.",1300480723

For the purposes of the data I was trying to show (that weekend and weekday rides are quite similar), that was the best way to plot the data.<p>Of <i>course</i> if I take a linear function, and plot its integral, it will be exponential. By definition. I recognize that.<p>But that's why I also plotted the weekly averages farther down. You can see the non-linear growth very clearly in that chart. In fact, if I log-transform the average rides per week, the plot is quite linear (as would be expected for exponential growth). r(ln(rides)) = 0.83<p>Your comment about the slope since last November being ""pretty linear"" is misleading, too, though!<p>If you take an exponential function, and arbitrarily select <i>any sub-segment of it</i>, that sub-segment will <i>always</i> have a better linear fit than the linear fit for the whole function.<p>So by definition, mathematically, you're right.

In binary, the only non-0 digit is 1. This means that, if Pi does in fact terminate, its binary representation must terminate in a 1 - any 0's to the right of the last 1 carry no value.<p>Now, that's a pretty big ""if"", but this isn't meant to be serious mathematics.

If you look at the USGS analysis [1] of the tsunami risk it does not extend below the western most part of California (Eureka/Fortuna area). This is a bit of fortunate geologic structure on the part of California. You might also note that there are no US nuclear power plants near the coast between Eureka and the southern border of Canada [2] so for some definition of risk avoidance, no one has built reactors there.<p>Point being, in California at least, there is a very very small chance that one of our reactor's disaster plans will be challenged by a combination 9.0 earthquake and a 30' tsunami.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1661b/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1661b/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NRC_regions_and_plant_locations_2008.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NRC_regions_and_plant_loca...</a>",1300478866

Before you bury this post as yet another frivolous ask HN post, I urge you to read through it.<p>For the last couple of years, I have had this ambition and itch to do my own startup. To pursue that dream, I left a cushy 9-5 job on the east coast,uprooted my wife and moved to the bay area to join a startup as a Django engineer. Since I did not have any great ideas of my own, I decided to take the next best route possible - to join a startup, learn the ropes, network around and then do my own thing.<p>Its been almost an year now working at the startup and I feel that things are not that exciting at work as before. And the urge to do my own startup has become even more stronger than before. As with several other folks, startup ideas continue to pop up in my head incessantly.<p>What I am seeking is some guidance, some direction in terms of how do I go about finding a viable startup idea. The best answer to that would be 'scratch my own itch'. To answer that, I have made several attempts to scratch my own itch. I worked on several ideas:<p>1) Foodspotting idea - I was midway through coding, when I found that FoodSpotting had already launched successfully (I was way behind in terms of development). 
2) Provide phone call support for pingdom alerts - found that pagerduty (YC company) already does this and does this well
3) Chatroulette for lunch - LetsLunch beat me to launch and execution.<p>I am looking for an idea that has a sustainable, viable business model. A geo / location / checkin / picture / group chat idea does not interest me since I dont use these services myself. Plus, I dont think that most of such services have a viable business model.<p>I've hit a major roadblock in terms of finding that next 'scratch my own itch' idea. I've even tried applying the lean startup model to a couple of ideas, but there didnt seem to exist a market for them.<p>Any pointers or suggestions that you can offer will be appreciated.",1300478815

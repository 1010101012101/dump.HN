170257,comment,170080,170080,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"All valid points <i>if</i> compared against a single-instance RDBMS. Except that modern RDBMS used in any large scale web service will also be guilty of these points. When you shard/cluster your data across various master/slave DB instances you essentially lose the ability to store your data in a non-atomic normal form, just like SimpleDB. In both a sharded RDBMS and SimpleDB your data is denormalized.<p>With a DB setup like this (and all major web sites are) you cannot feasibly join, group by (or do associated aggregations), or order by anymore anyway. Constraints are not really a good idea either. It would be nice if SQL was still useful in a situation like this but it just is not.<p>The days of hugely massive single machine databases is coming to and end if not already dead. Even if you are reporting on massive amounts of data and need to do aggregations across large datasets, then OLAP is increasingly becoming the way to go (again, with fact tables and cube partitions sharded across multiple instances to increase query performance).",1208835969

170254,comment,168636,168636,0,0,cowsandmilk,,,"related to malaria, maybe you want to look at Amyris Biotechnologies as a living example of similar ideas to what you describe.  They started with Bill and Melinda Gates money to produce artemisinin, which the grant stipulated had to be produced without a profit, but have taken that technology and have used it to grow an amazing Biotech startup that most PhDs in the field would die to work for.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation isn't usually thought of as a startup incubator, but this is one example of a company that started from the idea of treating malaria, and continues with that idea as they apply the same technologies to solve the other needs they see in the world.",1208835525

No longer having to worry about indexing, scheduled backups and database shrinks, temp table sizes, connection pooling, and all the other nasty stuff that goes along with maintaining a DBMS is equally as nice.<p>I've switched my project from a local MySQL instance to SimpleDB and I'm never looking back.

I know why Google/Amazon needed them, but those reasons don't apply to 99.9% of startups.<p>You don't need to buy your own RAID/SAN and powerful servers to use RDBMS, nearly every modern scalable hosting provider will be happy to rent them to you just like Amazon: get an account on Slicehost for smaller projects and move up to EngineYard or Joyent for high-end stuff: they will all let you scale up as needed, use DB of your choice.<p>P.S. I also think the author forgot about yet another important advantage of RDBMS: there are tons of various tools for them. Yes, he mentioned import/export/backup, but the list is much longer than that.",1208834435

170234,comment,170080,170219,0,0,irrelative,,,"True, but the reason that SimpleDB is so inexpensive is because all of the items you mention have gotten so cheap.  A managed server, where the provider does all the backup and RAID stuff, costs ~$100/month.  That's nothing, given the tremendous benefits (like, joins that allow for normalization, your own backup, no vendor lock-in, etc).<p>I understand the desire for something that's maintained by someone else and makes life easy, but if you're a tech startup, this stuff ought to be second nature.",1208833598

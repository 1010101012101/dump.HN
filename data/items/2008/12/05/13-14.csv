386972,comment,386392,386744,0,0,dpatru,,,"Of course <i>any</i> economic process, when you look at it closely, can appear complicated. To use an old example, think of all that is necessary to make an ordinary wood and graphite pencil. A depth-first investigation of the process shows that wood must be obtained, which requires access to forests, which requires permission to enter land, which implies that land boundaries exist and are recorded, which  requires surveyors to determine boundaries, which require surveying schools, which require learning supplies, which among other things require ordinary pencils, so we're back at the start... My point is that it's not a requirement that one fully understands something before one can make suggestions. I don't have to be an expert in surveying school materials to be able to criticize the performance of a pencil. It's enough to have a general understanding.<p>Similarly, it's not necessary to understand exactly how government makes money or through which agency (be it the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the US Mint, Bureau of Engraving, etc.) to criticize that fact that the money is under exclusive government control.",1228484235

Iodized water should be used to make people's lives better and reduce their pain - not to increase their intelligence by some token amount</i><p>If it was just a ""token amount"" I'd agree with you. But it isn't. Half a billion people in India suffer from Iodine deficiency (source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency#Local_impact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency#Local_impact</a> )<p>If half a country's population have reduced intelligence of about 10 IQ points because of this, then obviously that country's economy will suffer. If India had had no iodine deficiency since independence in 1948 it might be as rich as South Korea today -- it would certainly be richer than it is.<p>People in poor countries have IQ scores (as callibrated using Western norms) of 70 or so. (source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_race#Worldwide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_race#Worldwide</a> )<p>Partly this is due to social differences, i.e. growing up in an environment where there are less problems like IQ tests.<p>But partly also it is genuinely due to lower intelligence. If in those countries you ended chronic undernutrition, ended lack of micronutrients, ended cousin marriages, improved sewers, hygeine and basic healthcare, these people would grow up with IQs similar to those in the western world. This would lead to their economies becoming richer.<p>So it isn't just a ""token amount"" it's a big fucking deal.",1228484202

ObjC 1.0 dates back to the mid-80's, if not sooner, if you count some of the work done with SmallTalk as a predecessor.

Over time cruft accumulates--and you continue to notice new problems you didn't anticipate when you first designed--and almost always it is much quicker to rewrite a second version than the first.<p>The 3 lines of code per day metric seems fishy to me, but it seems to be based on systems level projects (lets build a new operating system) rather than making a new PHP photoalbum for Grandma.

27087,comment,27086,27086,0,0,tx,,,"I have been seeing more and more articles and blog posts about Mono lately but I fail to realize the importance of it. I wish I was rude enough to just email to Miguel and ask him why has he dedicated so much time of his life working on it, but I better ask people who's not related to Mono - you.<p>Seriously, what is their motivation? I mean Mono people's. What they are doing, how I see it, is porting someone else's platform (Microsoft) which by itself is in essense just a copy of another platform (Java)... which <i>already</i> runs fine on Linux! Basicaly it lookts to me that Mono guys are just building a <i>poor performing copy of copy of something original</i> (Java platform) which already is built and works just fine. And have been, for a long time alreay. So long, that people are already getting bored with it.<p>Why??? Any ideas?

tx<p>P.S. I've been working with .NET for a while. Yes, it's rich and seem to have every imaginable feature, so do Python/Perl/Ruby/Java with their libs (all are 1st class Linux citizens). Why would one want to port .NET to Linux is beyond me...

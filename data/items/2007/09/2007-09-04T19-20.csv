Put the ad copy over background images of the laptop with the Scriggler on it.  Honestly, it would be better if you had one of those images as your header instead of the album-cover satellite art.

Unfortunately, the demand for stories is based almost entirely on how appealing they are.

50096,comment,49964,49983,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Dvorak makes it seem binary. You either have a local solution or you have to rely on a web server.  I bet many successful apps in the future will have a slightly thicker client (e.g., based on Adobe AIR, Microsoft Silverlight, etc) that syncs with the cloud but still operates locally.  Google Gears is one step in that direction.",1188934408
50095,comment,49860,50061,0,0,aaroniba,,,"The JVM being well-specified is what allows other languages (like JavaScript) to be compiled to run on it.  It also makes it easier to extend.<p>Rhino on JVM has the advantages of having access to any java library you want (sun distributes many standard ones, and there are tons of other open-source ones on the internet).  Another advantage is that the JVM does hotspot optimization which leads to speed improvements.  Most other interpreted languages, such as Ruby or Python, are not as far along with their runtimes.<p>As for Java vs. scripting languages, that's a matter of taste.  In my experience the way to minimize bugs is to write less code, and I explained above why Java programs tend to be verbose, so I believe the benefits of terseness in scripting languages outweigh the benefits of static typing in Java.

And also I can almost guarantee that there is no non-trivial software that is bug free. As a programmer the only way you can guarantee bug-free code is to not program at all.<p>So if you follow this advice, you will never update at all, which in my opinion is bad because the benefits of an update outway the negatives.",1393203414

There&#x27;s at least one wildly successful example of this successfully being done for GCC, which is a project even bigger and more complex than Vim. Around GCC 2.8, it was forked into EGCS where major changes were made. This fork was so successful that it then became the official branch of GCC, and modern versions of GCC are direct descendants of EGCS.",1393203370
7288520,comment,7283501,7285235,1,0,just2n,,,"Putting aside the fact that the budget for that particular small public state funded University didn&#x27;t require more than the public funding and tuition, that premise seems odd.<p>If the justification for someone&#x27;s salary is &quot;they make us that much money&quot;, then why would the University refuse to compensate an IT worker who demonstrably saved the school $50,000+ a year by having extraordinary skills for their position?<p>Or why can&#x27;t there be Alumni relations staff that only exist to cater to Alumni and extract as many donations as possible? Why does it make sense that the President would do that?<p>Does Obama, to make a stretch comparison, raise all democratic party donations himself? It seems a silly thought. And if he did, would it justify giving him a salary of some outrageous number, just so long as we point out that he raises more money than he costs? Say, $20,000,000/yr salary and he brings in $90,000,000?<p>I&#x27;m all for profit sharing, but that brings up an even bigger question: why is there only a single person in the University being given the option of profit sharing? In a place where raises didn&#x27;t happen for nigh on 10 years straight and bonuses were unheard of, if you could generate more value for the University than your cost, in multiplicity, you should see part of it. It&#x27;s not OK to do that for the independently wealthy white man running the University with a base salary of $300,000, allowances upwards of $250,000 and a paid-for home while keeping the guy making $40,000/yr who just kept you from needing to buy $100,000 in software and consulting from seeing a single additional penny.

7288513,comment,7287789,7288096,1,0,001sky,,,"This is a point well made, but ~marketable demographics are  relevant to a biz based on ad revenue like FB. So it is a legit concern if new customers are dilutive from this perspective. But...and this is the big but...the what&#x27;s app M&A deal seems to be purposefully orthogonal to &quot;ad based eyeballs&quot; both from a product and a strategic perspective. Comms svcs are actually inherently valuable in their own right (point 1) and often this value is ruined by advertising (point 2); as a result things like mobile telco is paid for by services fees rather than intrusive and manipulative advertising. Now, with those two counter-balancing points being made, the valuation question for any company (pre-IPO) with a $19B purchase price at something like 40x Revenues (assuming ~$500m/yr) is still open to legitimate &quot;interpretation&quot; (er, questioning).  I don&#x27;t think pure math questions can be dismissed out of hand on that. The one explanation that does likely have some grain of truth to it, is whether or not we are in a &#x27;bubble&#x27;...FB is protecting its valuation. That is to say, the damage done by <in>action is likely to cost FB more than $19B if they get leap-frogged by the next major evolution in the market. So, in other words, it seems there is some logic that backs this deal with or without the bubble question really being relevant. At least to FB.",1393203233

Many agencies won&#x27;t let you a flat if you make less than 36k, but that&#x27;s below average and way below median.<p>Any regulation or tax will we bypassed.

Less of a problem for unskilled workers, maybe.<p>And it&#x27;s worth bearing in mind that work is pretty difficult to find in many cases – even inside London. A relatively sleepy town in Cornwall is going to have fewer jobs available, and they&#x27;ll offer lower incomes.<p>But I guess the biggest objection is that this doesn&#x27;t really get to the core of the problem – there is a load of underused housing stock in London, there&#x27;s insufficient supply of cost-effective housing, and there is consistent government policy in place which encourages people to move to London. That&#x27;s a really unstable situation and we need to make moves towards fixing it.",1393202540

For more details, you can refer to <a href=""https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-tradeoffs/#Proxies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-...</a>.<p>This specific proposal is interesting because it specifically is related to opportunistic encryption proposals, in particular, the one that allows sending <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> URIs over an unauthenticated TLS connection: <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-httpbis-alt-svc-03#section-3.6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-httpbis-alt-svc-...</a>. The problem here for proxies is, if you mix http and https (authenticated) traffic on the same TLS connection, the proxy cannot tell if it can safely MITM the connection. The proxy vendor would like to know if it can do so, probably for network management / caching / content modification reasons. Of course, the point of the opportunistic encryption proposal is to increase security (although its actual effective impact is controversial: <a href=""https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-tradeoffs/#OpportunisticEncryption"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insouciant.org/tech/http-slash-2-considerations-and-...</a>). But if you believe in opportunistic encryption&#x27;s security purposes, then it doesn&#x27;t seem to really make sense to make the MITM&#x27;able traffic identifiable so proxies on the network path can successfully MITM them without detection.",1393201532

Our intuition for physical determinism breaks down at the nanoscale. One major fault of this video is that, at low Reynolds number, there&#x27;s essentially no inertia. So the representation of kinesin taking deterministic, 100% processive steps is an absurd idealization. The motion is dominated by thermal fluctuations (which, by the way, are occurring on a nanosecond timescale).<p>At the same, even as a biophysicist, I think these animations are superb learning tools.

It has been customary for consumer-bound traffic to not count against the balance, since it was a relatively minor portion of the overall traffic exchanged. With the advent of high-resolution consumer-oriented video services like Netflix, that has changed - consumer traffic has become a significant portion of overall traffic exchanged, which causes a flow disparity between the two peering partners and places a disproportionate burden on one.<p>If this were not consumer-bound data, then Cogent would likely already be paying for the disparity. As it is, it&#x27;s a good guess that Cogent has refused to compensate Comcast for the additional load on their network build-out and maintenance costs, instead relying on the good-faith consumer data exception to exempt them from paying for it. Comcast&#x27;s response to this was to steal Netflix&#x27;s business from Cogent, thereby alleviating the uncompensated load that Cogent was placing on their network and improving Netflix&#x27;s deliverability.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch.

I meant it as being helpful.<p>I&#x27;ll add that the Latin <i>vale</i> can be used to mean &quot;farewell&quot;, which is usually how it&#x27;s translated, but if you dig down the etymology rabbit hole, they come from two different language families and not surprisingly don&#x27;t mean the same thing.<p>&quot;farewell&quot; is from somewhere between 1200 and the 14th century middle English, a composite of <i>faren</i> &quot;fare&quot; and <i>wel</i> &quot;well&quot;. The phrase used to be &quot;fare thee well&quot; but was contracted later. All have Germanic roots.<p>&quot;fare&quot; is old-English <i>fær</i> means &quot;to go forth on a journey&quot; and still hangs around in some words like &quot;sea-faring&quot;, &quot;wayfarer&quot; and &quot;farewell&quot; (&quot;fare&quot; eventually turned into the more modern meaning &quot;payment for passage or conveyance&quot;, but that&#x27;s a digression).<p>&quot;well&quot; in the sense of &quot;farewell&quot; these days connotes good health (as in &quot;are you well?&quot;) but originates also in Germanic tongues to mean &quot;satisfactory&quot;.<p>&quot;thee&quot; is also proto-Germanic in origin and I won&#x27;t belabor it.<p>Swedish speakers may recognize this in the modern form as &quot;farväl&quot; and Dutch as &quot;vaarwel&quot;<p>A &quot;valedictory&quot; is usually translated as &quot;a farewell address&quot; and the act of the speech the valedictorian gives is called a &quot;valediction&quot; (a farewell). But this isn&#x27;t strictly correct. &quot;valedictory&quot; means something more like &quot;words for good health&quot;.<p>So it&#x27;s more like we commonly translate &quot;hope you feel well!&quot; to &quot;have a safe trip!&quot; which isn&#x27;t really quite right.<p>It&#x27;s interesting then that:<p>a) &quot;well&quot; has come to adopt the Latin meaning &quot;health&quot; in the sense that &quot;valere&quot; means &quot;well&quot; i.e. &quot;health&quot; (similar to &quot;valetudo&quot; or &quot;valetudinis&quot;). &quot;valere&quot; more strictly translates to &quot;health&quot; (which all the other meanings connote e.g. &quot;strength&quot; &quot;well&quot; etc.). Also found in words like &quot;convalescence&quot; with the &quot;strength&quot; connotation ending up in words like &quot;valiant&quot; and &quot;validity&quot;. When we &quot;validate&quot; something, we are proving it to be strong, which is a connotation of &quot;healthy&quot;. So it really means &quot;to prove to be healthy&quot;.<p>b) We define Latin words in terms of Germanic explanations, but not the other way around. e.g. if you look up &quot;farewell&quot; in the dictionary it&#x27;s not defined as a &quot;valediction&quot;. Which would come as no surprise to those that know that English is a Germanic language.",1393200208

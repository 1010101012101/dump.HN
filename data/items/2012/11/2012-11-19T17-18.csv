A JIT in the kernel has costs and benefits.  You could as easily say that the ability to load modules dynamically into the kernel is ""utterly wrong,"" since it opens up a code-injection vector that makes rootkits and other malware much easier to write.  In some ways dynamically-loadable modules could be seen as even more risky than a JIT, because a JIT can only generate a subset of all possible machine code.

This was one of the reasons why we encouraged everyone to submit a speaker proposal. Sadly, BritRuby was used as the arena to air these issues on Twitter and this has fundamentally destroyed any chance we had of addressing these issues. Instead the community should have worked together and allowed us to bring these issues to light at the conference. How can the community address these issues if every time someone tries they are shot down and accused of such awful things? ""<p>I really feel for the organisers. Organising conferences is a bloody hard and often thankless task. But when you're aware of the problems with sex and technology conferences - and when their are numerous examples of previous similar shit storms - doesn't putting out a male-only speaker list just seem a tad... sub-optimal?<p>In the last year or so I've been to about a dozen technical conferences and events in the UK, mainland Europe and the US. The only ones that didn't have female speakers were the ones with only 1-3 speakers. I can tell by the quality of the female speakers I did see that they were not chosen for their sex.<p>Great female speakers are out there. You don't have to pick by gender quota.<p>I helped organise the UX stage of Agile 2012. We had a 50/50 male/female speaker split on that stage with zero effort on my part - apart from rabidly pursuing good speakers - some of which were female (the selection process was briefly discussed in another thread for those who might be interested <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3993049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3993049</a>). Plenty of female speakers on the other stages too.<p>At the moment I'm organising a UK conference for early next year (<a href=""http://www.balancedteam.org/2012/11/12/balanced-team-uk-2013..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.balancedteam.org/2012/11/12/balanced-team-uk-2013...</a>) and the survey has already produced some great possible speakers of both sexes, and a volunteer team of one man and four women.<p>Wearing my conference organiser hat: If my CFPs and my personal network had only produced a list of male speakers I'd be going ""Fuck. I've messed up somewhere."" because I see great female speakers every time I go to any major conference.<p>I'd be reaching out to folk like <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/</a>, or <a href=""http://www.womenwhotech.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.womenwhotech.com/</a>.

Nothing is truly obvious, and we've obviously conditioned from our surroundings. While we've obviously adopted conventions to interact with computers, they've offered affordances (or forced us) that hint at a function.<p>Gestures in general offer a challenge from a human factors perspective. Gestures can be very convenient and compelling sources of interaction that can enhance UX. Unfortunately, users are working in flatland, with very little affordances. The biggest problem here and with gestural interfaces in general is the lack of hints they give to an interaction. A physical button has a clear affordance (you can argue this is conditioned/learned) baked into the interface. There are also many issues related to the lack of universal gestures within and across applications and operating systems.<p>In a lot of cases, Gestures are like keyboard shortcuts. Many people discover them because they are told about them (ie. CTRL+C in the copy interface), but physically trying many different keyboard combinations just isn't something people do.<p>Apple has recognized the problem with gestures while pushing hard to make them standard. They still keep the home button on the iPad, even with system wide gestures that can accomplish the same thing. Overall, I agree with your sentiment that particular interactions join the ranks of some ubiquitious interactions you noted, but it will take more than a few months of use from one particular operating system and there are many challenges, no matter how convenient it is.",1353346061

I know, I know, it's a religion and all that, but let's put it this way:  you can get high-performance Lisp code, there are Lisp compilers that allow you to do things at the machine level (SBCL, for example, has support for pointers and inserting assembly language instructions), and OSes have been written in Lisp in the past.<p>Why this over C++?  Well, first of all, basically anything is better is C++ at this point, but as for why Lisp in particular, there are a few reasons.  First, I won't deny my own biases -- I know Lisp, I use it in my work, and I know that the tools to do the things I mentioned above already exist (perhaps an ML fan can answer whether or not such things are available in SML or OCaml).  Second, Lisp is never really ""out of date,"" in the sense that you do not <i>need</i> to rewrite your compiler to introduce a new language feature (consider what was required to add lexical closures to C++, and compare to something like CLOS, which can be implemented in macros for Lisps that do not have object oriented constructs).  Finally, there is the expressive power of Lisp; an experienced Lisp programmer will run laps around an experienced C++ programmer, simply because it is easier to describe a complicated program in Lisp than in C++ (this argument also applies to ML, Haskell, Python, and dozens of other languages; again, I will not deny a personal bias towards Lisp).",1353344989

Laws should serve me, and everyone, in that sense. (I also believe this brings the best overall outcome for society, but that's beside the point.)<p>You can define anything equivalently as a right or an obligation. ""The government should protect my right to own land"" ~ ""The government should provide soldiers (presumably funded through taxation) to evict other people from my land""; there's no qualitative distinction between property rights and e.g. a right to healthcare.<p>Copyright law does not make individuals more free, quite the opposite. It gives a small number of powerful organizations the power to control the much larger number of individuals who would want to create derivative works. There seems to be this weird blind spot on the political right where they're perfectly happy for people to be oppressed as long as it's not by the government. (Of course, the left has the opposite problem).<p>>I do not have any duty to ""serve the common good."" If we keep going towards that model, to the point that my own productive work is no longer productive for me, I will literally ""go on strike"" and just do manual labor to survive.<p>I hope this bluff gets called. Every aspect of modern life is made possible by others serving the common good.

Google? No way. That situation would help Microsoft, because they can start using the x86 chips that got popular on Android to promote their x86 tablets and hybrids, where Microsoft has a real strength because of legacy apps.<p>So Google is now pushing Intel chips into the market, and gaining who knows what, because I don't see any benefit for them, but definitely helping Microsoft in the long term. If Intel survives, Microsoft survives. You'd think Google would realize that and doesn't want that.<p>Google has absolutely no need for Intel in the future, even for their data centers.

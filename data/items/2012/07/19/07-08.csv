That's quite a good deal.</i><p>The only problem with reserving that instance for 3 years is that better hardware always comes along, especially with the cost of SSDs coming down significantly every year. Usually if you're in the big-data space, your hardware is likely retired after 24 months (12 months if you're well funded) so locking yourself in for 36 months might be a bad investment.",1342684772

It would be very handy to be able to spin up a few of these instances, load the indexes from an EBS volume onto the local SSDs, then run for a couple of hours or so. This is a very I/O intensive job that we need to run about once a week, but then the rest of the time could be idle.<p>SSDs would make our jobs run significantly faster.

4264928,comment,4263281,4263281,2,0,rcthompson,,,"Cells have the ability to sense DNA damage. They produce proteins that specifically recognize and bind to various signs of DNA damage, such as single-stranded DNA (normal DNA is double-stranded), DNA ends (which are normally protected inside telomeres), fused base pairs, etc. One possible response is to repair the damage, and this is done quite often. In fact, there is are <i>several</i> checkpoints during every cell division cycle where the cell will pause the cycle and wait for everything to report in as damage-free before continuing. It's actually a bit distressing to realize that pretty much every one of your cells is constantly fixing its genome in real time, and a bit mind-blowing how successful the process is (i.e. the fact that you don't get cancer several times a day).<p>However, another option in the case that the cell detects irreparable damage is for the cell to self-destruct. If the cell detects excessive DNA damage, it will initiate apoptosis. Also, if the DNA damage is taking too long to repair, the same will happen (kind of like Android's ""force close"" feature for hung apps). My assumption would be that most of the germline cells that are damaged by the radiation from a nuclear bomb would either fix it or kill themselves, leaving mostly perfectly healthy cells to produce healthy sperm & eggs.<p>In short, if 10% of your germline cells are damaged by radiation, you will not be producing anywhere near 10% mutated sperm (or eggs).",1342683843

What happened was devs got Linux boxes to replace SPARCstations (using them as cheap X servers) then x86 and x64 got good enough for servers, and everyone ditched Solaris in order to get onto the commodity hardware (Linux wasn't really a factor in this decision, it just happened to be the dominant Unix on that hardware at the time, could easily have been FreeBSD). Thanks to Microsoft and their NT pretensions, supporting hardware vendors (e.g. storage) were manufacturing compatible kit too. It didn't help that Sun managed to forget that they were a business, and a hardware business at that. Giving stuff away to drive sales is a proven strategy, but no-one was buying SPARCs.

Hardly; they're still mere statistics, which always lie. But statistics are closer to the truth than the dubious anecdotes we had before.

So if A is a necessary precursor to B and cannot be manufactured from more base components, we have a situation where low levels of B can impair some performance metric, and up to a point an increase in A will increase that metric. The body will maintain endogenous control of the various systems so long as it has the base inputs it requires. As an aside, even if A can be manufactured by cells e.g. cholesterol, there is the whole issue of whether the cells have enough energy/capacity to produce this compound in sufficient quantities at a given time along with all the other demands of them.<p>>Trust me.

This is a little less than HALF of what Amazon give, but costs about EUR180 a month and EUR150 for setup... but you do loose the elasticity of Amazon... Mind you, it is 1/10th of the price...<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex8s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex8s</a>",1342681464

Windows comes preinstalled on the\noverwhelming majority of computers today, and most of the time, there is no\nway around that. Most manufacturers even deny refunds, even when they are\nrequired to do so by law (""whatcha gonna do, <i>sue</i> us?"").<p>For the record, I've been having ""fun"" with Lenovo trying to get my rightly\ndeserved refund.

Apart from this, the comments contains many anecdotal responses from people who have dropped not only gluten, but all grain from their diet and had positive results. Moreover, take into account the blog's author who has published three books circulating around gluten-free foods -- something that Wheat Belly advises the reader to jettison altogether.",1342681355

I ask because I think the very clear answer is <i>yes.</i><p>I don't think the key issues are in terms of an exclusionary culture.  I think the key issues regarding startups are structural and expectation-based.

Wasn&#x27;t planning to upgrade my GTX680 for a while as it was plenty for GPU acceleration in Adobe apps and for gaming at 2560x1440 but the Rift pushes it to its limit in several applications.  Thought about just getting another 680 to put in SLI but my stupid past self didn&#x27;t buy an SLI motherboard and it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to buy another mobo, another 680, and rebuild the thing now that the 980&#x27;s are out.",1413550794

8470666,comment,8470206,8470206,0,0,seppalala,,,"Here&#x27;s the problems we&#x27;re solving with Docker:<p>* Sanity in our environments. We know exactly what goes into each and every environment, which are specialized based on the one-app-per-container principle. No more asking &quot;why does software X build/execute on machine A and not machines B-C?&quot;<p>* Declarative deployments. Using Docker, Core OS, and fleet[1], this is the closest solution I&#x27;ve found to the dream of specifying what I want running across a cluster of machines, rather than procedurally specifying the steps to deploy something (e.g. Chef, Ansible, and the lot). There&#x27;s been other attempts for declarative deployments (Pallet comes to mind), but I think Docker and Fleet provide even better composability. This is my favorite gain.<p>* Managing Cabal dependency hell. Most of our application development is in Haskell, and we&#x27;ve found we prefer specifying a Docker image than working with Cabal sandboxes. This is equally a gain on other programming platforms. You can replace virtualenv for Python and rvm for Ruby with Docker containers.<p>* Bridging a gap with less-technical coworkers. We work with some statisticians. Smart folks, but getting them to install and configure ODBC & FreeTDS properly was a nightmare. Training them in an hour on Docker and boot2docker has saved so much frustration. Not only are they able to run software that the devs provide, but they can contribute and be (mostly) guaranteed that it&#x27;ll work on our side, too.<p>I was skeptical about Docker for a long time, but after working with it for the greater part of the year, I&#x27;ve been greatly satisfied. It&#x27;s not a solution to everything—I&#x27;m careful to avoid hammer syndrome—but I think it&#x27;s a huge step forwards for development and operations.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://coreos.com/using-coreos/clustering/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coreos.com/using-coreos/clustering/</a><p>Addendum: Yes, some of these gains can be equally solved with VMs, but I can run through /dozens/ of iterations of building Docker images by the time you&#x27;ve spun up one VM.",1413550579

But you can get similar results of representation, even under dictatorships, by varying the people’s location instead.<p>Assuming you are able to move to the canton or municipality where you feel the dictators represent your tastes & beliefs, such competition would put pressure on local municipal dictators to please taxpaying constituents so they stick around.

It makes it a breeze to deploy a Node.js app to a Windows server without ever actually dealing with the pain of Node.js on Windows.<p>Also, it makes the build process more transparent.  Our build server is Team City, which keeps various parts of the configuration in many different hidden corners of a web interface.

Because of this you can increase immensely your reading speed if instead of having to move your focus from word to word, you focus on a point and the word changes at a certain cadence. Typically, with some practice you can increase that cadence to numbers such as 500 words per minute comfortably, which is a lot more than what the average person can read and works brilliantly if you read light stuff (I wouldn&#x27;t use it for hard technical stuff, because you need more time to process the information for it to make sense).<p>I looked for speed reading apps for WP8 and found a few, but they required you to either copy&paste the text you want to speed read, required the text to be in OneDrive or that you&#x27;d copy the url of the page you wanted to speed read.<p>So I did Lectito (it means reading in Latin): http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/lectito/c4f00daf-d815-4868-8e65-a55ae40708e2<p>Lectito can be &quot;launched&quot; from Internet Explorer using the sharing option and it also supports pictures (it will display them and their &quot;alt&quot; text), which was another feature lacking in all the apps I&#x27;ve tried.<p>I&#x27;m still adding features and making stuff better in general.

Doing this properly is very much research-project territory.<p>And unless I&#x27;m reading the RFC incorrectly, I think this is more principled than you&#x27;re making it out to be. `FromError` is not magic or specially-handled by the compiler in any way, it&#x27;s just a trait defined in the stdlib. The `try!` macro isn&#x27;t calling any magic methods, it&#x27;s just expanding to a pattern match that itself makes use of typeclasses. It&#x27;s indeed true that this would only work with variants of the `Result` type, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s especially heinous (users can easily supply their own specialized versions of this type, and almost always do). And if the `?` syntax is accepted, it will be able to be used with any type that implements the `Carrier` trait (which is <i>sorta</i> specially-treated by the compiler, though users can still override it via lang items), and would replace the `try! macro entirely.

It assumes that the top of the wing is greater, so the speed of the air is greater, so the pressure on the top of the wing is smaller.

8470489,comment,8467772,8467772,0,0,benjaminjackman,,,"I am not that familiar with Rust, however every time I see it I am more and more impressed.<p>One thing that I don&#x27;t see here but which I think it might be important is to grab the stack trace in the failure, or atleast the Filename / Line Number of where each Err is allocated. It will be really useful to be able to see the details for figuring out what went wrong, and following the stack trace is very important. With that I think the abstraction is 99%+ superior to exceptions, which is quite a step forward for the programming craft.<p>What really has to be guarded against though is that a lot of functions are going either have function signature that is much more verbose which leads programmers `cheating` and just `swallowing` the error by forcing the result out -OR- Return type inference might save the day (not sure if Rust has return type inference of not), however it doesn&#x27;t solve everything, writing the return types on public functions pretty quickly becomes standard operating procedure, and then programmers are going to get lazy again and we are right back at checked exceptions `polluting` their interfaces and they might not want to deal with it.<p><pre><code>  interface Perfect {
    def foo : Foo
    def bar : Bar
  }

  interface NotPerfect {
   def foo : Result[Foo, FooErr]
   def bar : Result[Bar, BarErr]
  }
</code></pre>
Which of these do I implement first? Does the type system allow me to substitute a Perfect when a NotPerfect is required, or do I have to re-teach it every single time, that in fact, it&#x27;s totally ok to do so (make a method `perfectCanBeUsedForNotPerfect(p : Perfect) : NotPerfect = new NotPerfect ....)`? Can I fix the issue for a limited set of cases and declare that Perfect implements NotPerfect and is therefore a subtype? Can I do similarly if I implement NotPerfect after Perfect was implemented (add an implicit conversion from Perfect to NotPerfect)? Can I just avoid the whole problem all-together with by-name subtyping (aka Point3{x,y,z} is considered a subtype of Point2{x,y} because Point3 has all the same named fields as Point2 with an extra one added) and informing the type system of the fact that Foo is a valid substitution for Result[Foo,_] because Result[A,B <: Err] is a type-disjunction of A | B and type-disjunction allows for substitution by the disjoint types? Where is Rust going to fall on this continuum and how many programmer hours is going to waste for each and every one of them to teach the its type-system over and over and over these simple patterns via boilerplate code?<p>We static programmers will grumble on regardless, we pay our dues to the type checker because we believe its gives us structure and forces failure when while we write the code, not because we want to write boilerplate to teach it simple facts.<p>...<p>All in all this is really cool. From a Scala perspective it&#x27;s a much improved version of Either (and now Try), and it&#x27;s going to be supported by the standard library in Rust. Which is awesome.<p>Either itself basically is Scala saying, we don&#x27;t have type disjuction, so here is a disjunction of 2 types which we will call Left and Right. And by convention Left is used to hold the error condition.<p>Because no one could remember that Left by convention meant error, and because it would by nice to gussy up what is held in the error type by having your errors be able to point a source error, Scala then later added a Try disjunction. Which is composed of two types Success[A](a:A) and Failure(e : Throwable).<p>The Success part is fine it&#x27;s hard to mess that part up, it&#x27;s just like Ok, having a uniform this just a wrapper around another type would be nice but, we suck that down as programmer business as usual, the Failure side however leaves a lot to be desired, by DESIGN the failure side cannot hold a failure and instead has to hold an exception, this is wrong, failure is a failure. Given the runtime on which Scala runs, the JVM, ignoring exceptions all-together is probably a worse evil. However it should have been made a special subcase of the Failure subclass rather than the only thing it can contain, or Try itself should have been the sub-implemenation of some more generic structure.<p>What to add a custom message to your failure? Ok make an exception that has a message in it.<p>Want to pass a Failure up the chain while adding your own error message for context? Ok make an exception then add the failure into it.<p>Want to fail without an exception? Ok make an exception and put it in the Failure.<p>Looks like Rust is moving towards a great implementation. This is something that has to be done in the standard library and has to be done well. The more I see of Rust as a language the more impressed I am, when is Rust going to compile to Javascript, oh never I see[1], well back to my ScalaJS cave then :)<p>1:<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630403"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4630403</a>",1413547366

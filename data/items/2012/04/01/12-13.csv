When you're not anyone important you can be brutally honest and say what you want like everyone else does. But as soon as you're in the public eye you're put on this pedestal. This is what scares the hell out of me. I'm a very uncensored person who says what he means and means what he says (and am an asshole sometimes). So the thought that one day IF I'm successful in getting my business off the ground a life of censorship awaits me. :(<p>Then I see celebrities like Snoop Dog (who owned a porn company), Sarah Silverman (who has some of the most offensive jokes imaginable), lil john (self explanatory), Colin Farrel, Charlie Sheen, Lindsey Lohan, and other well known figures who say and do anything they want yet still have successful careers, keep starring in movies, and even get in on really good business deals and endorsements. Lets not forget the Lady Gaga / Polaroid event where during the unveiling she said ""smile you're fucking famous"" and other unprofessional phrases.<p>It's like there's absolutely NO consequence for them. I guess because it's their ""image"" and it's ""expected"". So I guess the moral of the story is, become an offensive comedian /or/ celebrity known for being crazy and work your way up towards serious entrepreneur. That way you can talk shit and get away with it. OR start out as the well spoken guy, and just 1 accidental F-bomb later, show up on the news as the bad guy and get thrown out by your company board.<p>EDIT: ALSO, wtf did Notch gain by saying ""You're an insane idiot""?!

For just getting some pics up to a webpage, without any chance of it be used in other contexts, YMMV.<p>Compared to GIMP for example, there are tons of stuff that make it better for a professional workflow.

3783499,comment,3781035,3783283,1,0,pron,,,"The Scala hype, if there ever was one, started because for a long while Scala was the only high-performance alternative to Java on the JVM. Groovy was too slow, and many people prefer static typing. But then a large gap started to emerge between what most Scala users <i>needed</i> (and the reasons they turned to Scala in the first place) and what the language designers decided to give them. There were all sorts of funny operators and then implicits, meant to support DSLs. Then came all sorts of nifty tricks like type constructors, whose purpose, I think, was to simply prove that it's possible to build a statically typed language that has inheritence, yet does not require casting, ever. That is, if you're willing to put in the time to learn the intricacies of the type system. Well, they've proven it's possible alright. It is truly a great achievement in PL research, only it came at the price of making the language more annoying with each release. Who cares if you need to cast now and then if it makes the type system simpler and compilation times shorter?\nNow there are other alternatives. For those wishing to see the light of a new, better, way to program modern machines there's Clojure. For the more timid of heart, Kotlin has been/is being released. It is everything Scala's original users wanted from the language.",1333283374

It's naive to think that large ISPs in countries without active legislation aren't linking intelligence agencies into their networks.</i><p>No, it's actually worse having it legislated.<p>Having it happen covertly (and in shame) by the agencies, would be much preferred.<p>By legislating it, you enable it to be more widespread, used in court, etc. But the worst thing is, that by legislating, you make it normal, and that pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable. Since now, this monitoring is acceptable, then even worse things can take its place in the ""secret"" surveillance domain.<p>This line of thinking, is similar to what (philosopher) Zizek describes when talking against  legalizing torture in the US:<p>""*Why not go further still and legalise the torture of prisoners of war who may have information which could save the lives of hundreds of our soldiers? If the choice is between Dershowitz’s liberal ‘honesty’ and old-fashioned ‘hypocrisy’, we’d be better off sticking with ‘hypocrisy’.<p>I can well imagine that, in a particular situation, confronted with the proverbial ‘prisoner who knows’, whose words can save thousands, I might decide in favour of torture; however, even (or, rather, precisely) in a case such as this, it is absolutely crucial that one does not elevate this desperate choice into a universal principle: given the unavoidable and brutal urgency of the moment, one should simply do it. Only in this way, in the very prohibition against elevating what we have done into a universal principle, do we retain a sense of guilt, an awareness of the inadmissibility of what we have done.<p>In short, every authentic liberal should see these debates, these calls to ‘keep an open mind’, as a sign that the terrorists are winning. And, in a way, essays like Alter’s, which do not openly advocate torture, but just introduce it as a legitimate topic of debate, are even more dangerous than explicit endorsements. At this moment at least, explicitly endorsing it would be rejected as too shocking, but the mere introduction of torture as a legitimate topic allows us to court the idea while retaining a clear conscience. (‘Of course I am against torture, but who is hurt if we just discuss it?’).<p>Admitting torture as a topic of debate changes the entire field, while outright advocacy remains merely idiosyncratic. The idea that, once we let the genie out of the bottle, torture can be kept within ‘reasonable’ bounds, is the worst liberal illusion, if only because the ‘ticking clock’ example is deceptive: in the vast majority of cases torture is not done in order to resolve a ‘ticking clock’ situation, but for quite different reasons (to punish an enemy or to break him down psychologically, to terrorise a population etc). Any consistent ethical stance has to reject such pragmatic-utilitarian reasoning.""<p><a href=""http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n10/slavoj-zizek/are-we-in-a-war-do-we-have-an-enemy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n10/slavoj-zizek/are-we-in-a-war-do...</a>",1333283140

3783453,comment,3781641,3782073,2,0,leoedin,,,"That essay is really rather interesting and makes some great points. I do think that it misses some important areas though. Given that it was written in 2004, I'll give Paul Graham the benefit of the doubt. Most of my points have only really surfaced in the last few years.<p>1. He states at one point that ""It's absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty."", which is certainly true to an extent, but not completely. A recent BBC documentary looked at some of the poorest people in America.[1] The thing that really struck me about that is that these people, in absolute terms, are not poverty stricken. They're not short of shelter, food or water. \nIn relative terms though, they've been left behind. The modern american society simply isn't designed for people living on their income level. They live in motels without kitchens, so the option of cooking the basic staple foods eaten by those on similar income levels elsewhere is unavailable to them. They have to buy expensive packaged foods. The high cost of the society they live in means that their disposable income, and their ability to climb out of the economic hole that they're in, is almost certainly less than that of people with their absolute income in a poorer society. Poverty has to be considered in both relative and absolute terms. The people depicted in that documentary have fewer options available to them than those in poor countries. American health costs, education costs and rents are all designed for the average American income level.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9694000/9694094.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9694000/9...</a><p>2. There are aspects of society that set their own value. I know it's popular to complain about bankers right now, but they're probably the best example of this. Banking a necessary evil to allow us to deal with the vast, money based economy we've created. While almost every other industry operates by trading goods or non-monetary services for money (and so only sees money that's in some way related to their business expenses), banking sees <i>all</i> the money. A ""normal"" business can increase profits by maintaining or increasing income and reducing expenses (eg outsourcing, manufacturing in China, reducing material costs). Banks, by virtue of their operation, handle incredible amounts of money. They're in a unique situation that allows them to set the value of the service they provide. Not surprisingly, that service value is set considerably higher than perhaps it truly is.<p>It's obviously hard to place a value on the services provided by banks. In his essay, Paul Graham talks about wealth creation, giving a farmer as an example. The banking (and financial trading system) is not primarily a wealth creator. It's a system for moving that created wealth around. Banking can enable wealth creation with funding, but the system we have today has developed to reward activities with high returns over short periods. What I'd argue as true human wealth creation - manufacturing and valuable service provision - doesn't provide the returns that the banking system was looking for. The house of cards built up by high frequency trading, derivatives, futures and other hugely abstracted banking and trading concepts is far removed from this wealth creation.<p>Society rewards bankers with large amounts of money. Paul Graham argues that Steve Jobs increases material wealth, and so his monetary wealth in return was deserved. That's almost certainly true, but banking isn't a case of the average person going out and buying an iPad because it increases their material wealth. Bankers are rewarded richly because they've constructed a system over the last hundred years which takes large rewards for itself. There is very little true wealth produced by the system.<p>That essay was however written during the good times. In 2004 none of us were aware of just what a damaged financial system our economies are based on. In 2004 the families featured in that BBC documentary had a house with a hot tub. While I agree that there needs to be an incentive for productive working, there also needs to be a safety net. In our technology driven society, people shouldn't be struggling hard just to stay under a roof and feed their children. History has shown that the rich are the ones who have a voice, and so craft the system to benefit them.",1333281868

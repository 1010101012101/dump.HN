I don't think you understand how terminals work! The terminal commands (on <i>every</i> terminal I've used for the past 20 years) are interpreted by the server. If your terminal is connected to a unix machine then generally emacs key navigation is the default. This is true for Mac OS X. Meta-F and Meta-B go forward and backward by words. Meta-delete deletes a word. C-a (and the HOME key) will go to the beginning of a line. C-e (and the END key) will go to the end.<p>That being said there's a couple annoying (for powerusers) defaults in Terminal. I always use the ""option is meta"" setting so I can type Option-f when I mean M-f. Otherwise I have to type ESC-f which is harder for me. The other is that the naked HOME and END keys are by default bound to scrolling the terminal window and you have to press SHIFT-HOME and SHIFT-END to get Terminal to actually send the HOME and END character sequence through the terminal (same for page-up and page-down which are also stupidly backward). If you come from Linux and are used to using SHIFT-PAGE-UP for look at your scrollback then it can be annoying. But luckily those are easily fixed.",1321133836

In a recent project, a C++ version, using memory mapped files with a fixed-length record, was about 20 times faster than the hadoop version, and that's just the CPU.<p>The C++ version had: no deserializing needed, everything random access, multiple runs on same data had <i>NO</i> I/O requirements (mmap was cached between runs). It was about as hard to write.<p>So, instead of running a 100-core strong Hadoop install (which is small, but far from trivial), I was able to do with one hefty 8-core machine.<p>Scaling up is ""easier"" with Hadoop, in the sense that you can just throw money at it and get more EC@/rackspace nodes when needed.

Apes are accustomed to grappling with both hands and feet.<p>Flanged orangutans are considered highly dangerous, not only because they're significantly bigger, heavier and stronger than humans, but that it really doesn't matter if they get you with a hand or a foot, they've got enough strength in that limb that you can't let go.<p>So why does the media find all this amazing? Because humans are weak, and it seems like a divine intervention or something that made us survive because they play to their audiences naivety.<p>So how did we survive these brutal apes? Because we didn't evolve anywhere near them. Ape territories don't really overlap much, the different species have their niche to live in. So by the time humans encountered apes we'd already evolved tool use and sharpened sticks and heavy clubs were likely intimidating enough to keep the chimpanzee pack from messing with our ancestors.<p>This likely extended to other predator species of early humans too. Predators aren't dumb, they want an easy meal not something that could kill them. Once early humans started defending themselves with spears, wolves and lions would likely have looked elsewhere for food.",1321132396

Then there is a source of error because it seems the clock frequency of the ADC/DAC on the iPhone is not 100% accurate. If you recalibrate the app with a known distance (by moving the temp. slider until the displayed distance matches the actual distance) it should be pretty precise. No warranties, however. If the noise level is too high, it usually just doesn't show the measurement. There's one other source of error, that was actually the hardest to filter out: The sound doesn't only travel on the shortest path (line-of-sight) but on many paths. And often the sound from the longer paths arrive amplified, compared to the shortest path.",1321132104

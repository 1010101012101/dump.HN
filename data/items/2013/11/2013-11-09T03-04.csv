6700502,comment,6699737,6699967,2,0,arrrg,,,"For larger displays being shatterproof seems like the more important problem to me. Scratches are already hardly a problem with glass (I get the impression that tiny sharp rocks are pretty much the only thing that can cause problems in the environment those displays are usually in, so to avoid most scratches one has only to avoid laying the display face-first on some dirty/hard surface and sliding it around) and even then a few scratches are not as much a problem as a shattered screen. Shattering is much more fatal to the device and it often only takes one or two drops and the glass shatters.<p>Being absolutely scratch resistant is a desirable property for a camera lens (which is also much, much smaller and thus much less likely to shatter). It doesnt seem like such a desirable property and good tradeoff for screens, at least not as long it isnt as shatterproof as the best glass.<p>In many ways I tend to think that scratches are a solved problem on mobile devices. Current glass is good enough. Shattering is not. (Im not gentle to my devices but my 18 month old iPad has practically no scratches. Some are faintly visible if you look at it from certain weird angles. However, the glass of my previous iPad did shatter from a 1 meter or so fall of the edge of the device on tiles. Also, I see people using phones with shattered screens all the time. It seems to be a quite common occurrence.)<p>Yeah, improving scratch-resistance further would be awesome, but only if there is no trade-off with being shatterproof.",1383966578

To put it in extreme terms, you might only know how to draw with that lighting.<p>For unusual lighting (e.g. uplit), even an excellent artist would have to give it more attention. Similar to drawing a character from an unusual perspective. At any rate, drawing several unusual lighting angles will exercise one&#x27;s talents more than using the same standard one.<p>It&#x27;s literally looking at it in a new light.",1383966420

The cruise itself was, by far, the least expensive part of the entire trip.  Flying to Miami was probably the greatest expense.<p>If you do the cruise the way the cruise company wants you to, you&#x27;ll be blowing money in the casino and (especially) on alcohol.  The group I was with was composed of particularly ingenious tightwads, so we found out exactly how much water you&#x27;re allowed to bring (2L per person, or something similar), bought appropriate water bottles, filled them with vodka from Costco, and each took our allowed bottle of wine.<p>In general, I found the whole thing to be fairly dull, since I don&#x27;t care for gambling or hanging out at the pool, but it was relaxing, and a great way to get a quick view of several areas in a short time.

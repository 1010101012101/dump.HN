1230296,comment,1230099,1230099,0,0,teilo,,,"One of the reasons I love the unix world and despise Windows is precisely <i>because</i> things are not in black boxes. I can read and parse log files. Config is in text files that can be grepped. Automated processes are run from scripts that I can open and examine. Very little is done in a walled garden closed binary format. Even Apple's applications are folders inside of which I can find yet more scripts, text files, resources, etc. When something goes wrong I can usually figure out why. When something fails for some god-knows-why reason in Windows, I get an error box, and nothing else.<p>Please don't try to hide the guts of a system from me.

The loss of the FingerWorks products is bad for consumers, but there's no denying that the iPhone and the App Store it spawned are a far bigger market than FingerWorks would have ever had. If Apple could license the FingerWorks patents for keyboard use in a way that wouldn't erode their other product lines, they probably would.<p>It's important to remember that with the iPhone Apple was very much an upstart, with no experience in the cellular industry. They had a very tough time getting into the market because most carriers wouldn't agree to give Apple enough control to ensure that the carriers didn't ruin the user experience. They've now fundamentally changed the dynamics of the cellular industry, and all the device makers have more leverage. If Nokia and the other established phone manufacturers had been free to clone the iPhone as closely as they wanted, then the iPhone would have been mostly marginalized before Apple could even give it 3G capabilities.

(Terms that are way too long for the pace of the industry, too many vague and overly broad patents being granted, patents being granted for what is arguably mathematics, no provisions against patent trolls, etc.) We see and read about mostly the bad side of the patent system, and unless we actually try to find a good side, we'll assume there isn't one.<p>To give an example, I'm listed as a co-inventor on a pending patent application (though I will never get any royalties from it). The patent is for a type of device that costs more than a hundred thousand dollars to build. The owner of the patent will be a small business that deals with such small volumes that they will mostly have to license the patent to other companies in order to fulfill demand, but they hope to build and sell several of these devices themselves. When the project to develop this device started, most of the experts in the field told us that it was impossible. Now that we've published the basics of how our design works, it would be fairly easy for the large players in the industry to replicate our results without having to buy anything from us. If our patent application isn't granted, then the only way for the company to recoup their costs would be to treat the results of my research as a trade secret. (It's too late for that, though, and I've never signed an NDA.) Going the trade secret route would be a loss for the market, as I've already mentioned that the inventors can't meet the demand on their own. Getting a patent is a good compromise that allows my employer to recoup his costs, but also ensures that our invention can be put to good use.",1269983742

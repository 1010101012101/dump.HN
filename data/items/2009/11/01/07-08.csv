914839,comment,914573,914780,0,0,a-priori,,,"As a general rule, the human brain doesn't notice any delay of less that 100ms. Anything less than that is ""instantaneous"".<p>Light takes 1.6ms to travel 300 miles, or 3.2ms for a round-trip, which is well below that threshold. To get up to a 100ms round-trip, the two parties would have to be 0.05 light-seconds apart, or just shy of 15000km (9314 miles).<p>That's plenty to get you North America, Europe and East Asia, but unfortunately Australia is a bit far from North America or Europe.<p>Obviously, that's assuming the signals are transferred at the speed of light with no other sources of latency, which is an ideal. But still, it's a far cry from ""a hundred or few hundred miles"".",1257062191

Nice to see you around :)<p>So, are you saying that the rote structure of nuanced math is too complicated for it to be accurate or meaningful? I'm sure you're familiar with reductionism (<a href=""http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Reductionism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Reductionism</a>). Just imagine that mechanical duck as math.<p>One possible reason that we have not yet found ""that one fundamental"" thing in math is that our universe itself probably isn't a perpetual machine on its own (or, what we can perceive as our universe). So, there is a good chance that it is physically impossible for us to get to where you want us to be with our understanding of math. We wont know until we reach the singularity. But even then....<p>Anyway, my criticism of math has been that it has been getting far too philosophical. But, I am an amateur.",1257061734

Adults will always praise you; friends, awe and sometimes jealousy. But most people will feel alright and enjoy being your friend. In fact, there is a fairly strong positive correlation between intelligence and popularity at school (as long as you're not too introverted).<p>The culture of highly valuing academic excellence is one of the reasons that East Asia (esp those under Confucius influence) will likely dominate more and more areas of hi-tech industries over the next few decades (esp. the less creative areas--a likely drawback from working too hard at traditional academic excellence from too young an age is tunnel vision and perhaps getting your creative organs stifled.)<p>* Of course, there are exceptions like the Unabomber, but that's a very rare case. And if you want to filter out someone as intelligent as that when he intentionally wants to break the system, you might need to filter out 90+% of entering travelers anyway.",1257061641

Or, what does that sentence mean?<p><i>Maybe a different math for describing the universe written by an alien intelligence with different sensory organs could be simple for them, not still incomprehensible for us.</i><p>I think there is a strong argument against this.  That some alien race is really good at visualizing certain kinds of N-dimensional systems of some weird kind of space is plausible, but to throw all of mathematics out, I think, is not.  They would have a mere superset of the mathematics we have.<p>In particular, take computation.  Are aliens never going to deal with strings of units of data?  If they do, right there you have the notion of their length, and of natural numbers.  You have notions like concatenating strings.  And the homomorphism between the two.  And we're off on the road to abstract algebra.<p>It's very unlikely for smart aliens not to develop the same study of discrete math and abstract algebra that we do, unless they were never to use discrete units of information, and were only capable of processing infinite amounts of information at a time.  Would they then have no use for the idea of associativity?  Of proofs that consist of a finite set of symbols in a finite alphabet?  Of proofs that consist of a finite set of symbols in an uncountably infinite alphabet?  With any of these they would on the road to having a superset of our mathematical knowledge, rather than something different.  We don't know how such a being would be physically possible, in the first place.<p>I think it would be more correct, and less exciting, to predict that some aliens might be smarter than us in certain ways.",1257060655

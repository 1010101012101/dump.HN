So I go to Wikileaks and release the codes.<p>In this case, in whose interest is Wikileaks acting? Not the U.S. citizen's. Not the rest of the world. Clearly their acting as an agent for the Russians. (Russians are used here as a prop. Substitute any players you like)<p>The more I think about it, the more the idea of anonymous information leaking seems fraught with lots of problems. Overall, yes, a great idea. But I have some serious questions. As a third party with access to sensitive information, I can play all sorts of games using Wikileaks.<p>EDIT: I'll add a couple more examples so we don't get lost out in the weeds.<p>The Chinese decide to invade Taiwan. As part of that, over a period of several weeks Wikileaks ""discovers"" several documents detailing how certain Taiwanese officials were caught doing drugs/molesting children/robbing banks/beating old people. Most of these stories are true (but old), and generate quite a bit of negative press in the United States. Mixed in at the end, however, are totally false stories guaranteed to cause the greatest public outrage. The MSM has no time to vet the stories just before the Chinese invade, and since it's a 24/7 cable news world and since Wikileaks has a good track record so far and it runs them the MSM runs them too. Public opinion is sternly against giving Taiwan any assistance, creating a decisive edge for the Chinese.<p>The Israelis decide they are going to have to attack Iran to prevent it from developing nukes. Over a couple of weeks, suddenly documents are found from the French and Saudis ""proving"" Iran has a nuclear prototype bomb. More documents are ""found"" showing that the Iranians are prepared to use it on Israel. Let's assume these docs are real, although from the Israelis standpoint it doesn't matter. Finally docs are found that show the Israelis have decided to go through the United Nations and have given up trying to stop Iran with force. These last docs are released just a day or two before the attack.<p>The difference between a newspaper and Wikileaks is that <i>a newspaper deals in credibility. Wikileaks just deals in leaks.</i> That makes the model horribly broken and easy to manipulate. Just think of the fun an intelligence agency could have with something as simple as marital infidelities. Used to be you'd have to set up an entire operation to get stuff published with some kind of authority. Not anymore.",1269625410

Hedging is not part of its core competency, or at least it isn't unless they are pioneering a new business model of providing a service and then leveraging for profit on the futures markets. As in, they could have lost money on the hedge as well. Unless Southwest could use their understanding of the airline industry to predict a huge rise in oil demand, hedges should only be used as a tool to smooth out expense lines.<p>Here's an oversimplified example to illustrate: A gas station owner hedges oil futures. Might be smart because he isn't going to change his prices every day to reflect the spot price and customers appreciate it. He has a better forecast on his profitability because his expenditures are smoother. But it isn't really his core competency to predict oil prices.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_hedging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_hedging</a><p>TL;DR: Hedging can really help your profits but you don't read about the companies that lost money on hedges. Maybe Southwest was able to build a team of brilliant market researchers but I'm not sure it's a good idea for every company to buy futures.",1269624466

Not only is that only 0.0002% of their budget (the equivalent of someone who makes $50k a year wasting a dime), it probably cost more than that to put together and present the report. Small problems should be solved with small solutions (such as telling the conference planners that things seem to be costing too much, so they should try to be more budget-conscious: a solution which would take 15 seconds and cost nothing). Solving a wasted dime with a 26 page report is like spending 2 weeks improving the speed of a function by a few milliseconds when the function is only called once.",1269624461

One example: Americans’ likelihood of self-employment jumps when they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare</i><p>It's much more likely that people over 65 have started receiving their Social Security/401k benefits and have another source of income which minimizes the risk.<p>I'm not sure why people think insurance is going to be more affordable now. There are aren't any real price controls in the Health Care bill. Exchanges may lower the price but if Massachusetts is any guide premiums are going to increase.<p>There seems to be this belief that the government is going to mail you an insurance card if you don't already have coverage.
I think a lot of people are going to be shocked once they find out what the government has signed them up for.",1269623308

1221491,comment,1221094,1221094,0,0,macco,,,"Short answer: I don't think so.<p>Longer answer:
Business plans are valuable instruments. Their size and their form can differ - it is a difference to launch a web service or a biotect company. The first you can start with little money and your personal time - little plan, maybe only a few ideas on a napkin. The latter needs tremendous amount of money, maybe billions - big plan, over 100 pages.
IMO a business plan is a strategy instrument, that like any other strategy has to be adjusted the whole time. Maybe it is better to not write a business plan, but to develop a business plan - like you do with your software!",1269623276

A lot of people I know were outraged, but then after about a week or so, they get used to it, and before long, they are back to friending people they arent really friends with.  No one rags on the design now.  To be honest, I can not even recall what the old design looked like anymore...<p>Googles slight redesign had the same effect on me.

I was able to kill web server processes, investigate your server, and generally do things I shouldn't be able to do.

Checked exceptions are appropriate for some things, unchecked exceptions are appropriate for others. Use the right tool for the job.<p>Some parts of Java's API have made poor decisions in their use of checked exceptions (the close methods on file input streams and database connections, for example), but that doesn't invalidate the concept.<p>Correct use of checked exceptions helps create more solid code with less testing required, because the compiler is able to do checks that would otherwise have to be written into unit tests. Incorrect use of checked exceptions is what leads to all of the objections I've seen listed here.",1253186577

The cosmic operating system uses a command-line interface. It runs on something like a teletype, with lots of noise and heat; punched-out bits flutter down into its hopper like drifting stars. The demiurge sits at his teletype, pounding out one command line after another, specifying the values of fundamental constants of physics:<p>universe -G 6.672e-11 -e 1.602e-19 -h 6.626e-34 -protonmass 1.673e-27....<p>and when he's finished typing out the command line, his right pinky hesitates above the ENTER key for an aeon or two, wondering what's going to happen; then down it comes--and the WHACK you hear is another Big Bang.""<p>In The Beginning Was The Command Line, Neal Stephenson.",1253186561

Not having to be compatible with a prior lisp made it possible to have a lot of small things changed. Like the lambda function syntax, or the ""def"" special form, or the really nice reader syntax for vectors and maps. Both above the hood and below it's based on consistent abstractions. Other lisps would be too, no doubt, but they suffer from having evolved over a very long time.<p>And it grows, including towards what you it's say it's lacking right now. Recently it got the capability to work with mutable data structures (transients), which makes it less functional, but still without giving up the advantages.",1253186508

Some people drive Yugos, others drive BMWs or Audis. Arguably they all have their shortcomings and advantages, the market place decides who is 'best' for a particular application and budget.<p>Constructive criticism is not telling someone the stuff they use sucks because yours is better, it is telling someone what good things you can do with your toolset. Then you can objectively compare the two and you'll most likely end up somewhere in the middle.<p>The typical basher has already made up his mind beforehand, and will not move a micron to middle ground.<p>As soon as you start to make arguments like everybody should use X because everybody knows Y sucks (with or without specifics) it is no longer constructive.<p>If your stuff is hot shit then do something awesome with it and tell me about it.<p>That's a thousand times more powerful and productive as an argument than any kind of explicit or implied criticism will ever be accompanied by a 'drop what you're using' advice, especially if it comes packaged in the typical internet rant.",1263202252

Not all bashing is productive, but just focusing on positive aspects of every language without any critical thought doesn't work.  I would agree if you wanted to change your call for more balance and less comments that contain <i>just</i> bashing.<p>Critical thought and critical analysis requires criticism, it isn't pretty, but that's how things work sometimes.<p>As a reference, this is some of the more well-written criticism I've seen on languages and its existence makes the Internet a better place: <a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/</a>  (And I say this being rather fond of C++ actually.

Below a certain threshold of ""number of people times dedication"", any software can die. I just think this threshold is higher, or at least less predictable, in the case of proprietary software.<p>My examples makes no sense to you, but they make sense to me: I was thinking about a particular Windows95 game which I would have loved to see ported on the Pandora [1] : Earth siege 2. This is not possible because there is no source code to port, and emulation is out of question (the Pandora isn't powerful enough). The only reasonable solution I have is to clone it, almost from scratch.<p>About creating software, I agree that some (many?) software couldn't have existed as free software (only). However, this is not a proof that society needs them[2]. Even then, this does not prove Stallman wrong: he cares about freedom.

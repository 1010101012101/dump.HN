What do the records contain and what is it to China? Wouldn&#x27;t China be more interested in the &quot;personal information&quot; of their own peons?<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, these files can potentially contain very sensitive information. As part of the background check for some government positions, many dark secrets are unearthed and documented. Why? So that the government has a heads-up on how its employees may be compromised by foreign adversaries. So if the Chinese had such files on 20 million people, they would have a treasure trove of information to use as leverage against US citizens.<p>> Why the hell would the Chinese government give a flying fuck about a comedy about Kim Kong-Un?<p>They don&#x27;t, and the article never implies that they did. &quot;Admiral Rogers made clear in a public presentation to the meeting of the Aspen Security Forum last week that he had advised President Obama to strike back against North Korea for the earlier attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Theoretically, a fully free market (assuming that companies always have consumer <i>and</i> shareholder interests at heart) should be optimal, encouraging healthy competition, choice for the consumer, and the economic freedom to found your own startup. Unfortunately, the realities of the free market encourage economic foundationalism and excessive bureaucracy. Despite the free market&#x27;s relative strengths when looked at from purely a business and consumer perspective, the fastest way to earn revenue and (eventually) break even is to have a company playbook which encourages business decisions that are completely antithetical to what you&#x27;d expect from a free market company. After the inevitable IPO, they slowly tend towards maximizing shareholder profit in place of ensuring consumer satisfaction (there are exceptions to this rule-- Apple and Tesla are good examples), and the results are more acquisitions, more profiteering, more tax avoidance, and more focus on the bottom line than putting out a good product. Particularly harmful is how an unregulated free market encourages trusts and oligarchies -- the latter of which we still can&#x27;t solve today with legislation alone.<p>For every airbnb or Facebook there are a thousand of acquired startups who kept thinking short-term and forgot entirely about long-term. Which is a shame, because I&#x27;ve no doubt that many put out a quality product -- and I&#x27;ve also no doubt that the company which acquired them may very well have killed said company&#x27;s specific product two seconds after filling out all of the paperwork.

I read through it, and found no glaring technical errors (though my experience with a V-22 involves climbing inside one, once, to look at home someone did something I needed to replicate on something else, and a quick test flight in a V-22 simulator years ago as part of a &quot;hey come work here we are really cool&quot; career fair I attended). It&#x27;s competently written and talks about the issues the V-22 encountered in detail.",1438402463

One seems to misrepresent the situation to push his personal success. You&#x27;ve illustrated this pretty well on F-16 case. Another systematically misrepresents the necessity/effectiveness of programs to rake in billions of dollars and has been caught in such schemes many times. Gets away with it because Congress has lots of votes/stock in defense and brass often get hired by them near retirement. I&#x27;m not liking my options haha.<p>You have a point, though, in that my own bias against the wasteful program caused me to leverage sources without enough verification. I need to be more careful about that in near future. Thanks for calling me on it.",1438402425

What you&#x27;re saving is the CPU cost of malloc()+free().<p>I&#x27;ll trust that they had good performance data that made them decide to do this.  Still, I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about these clever string tricks.  It&#x27;s an optimization that looks amazing in microbenchmarks but has costs in the real world.  That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re adding a (potentially hard-to-predict) branch to <i>every</i> access to the string.<p>If your application constantly allocates and deallocates lots of tiny ASCII strings, this clever representation will be fantastic for you.  However, if you use a mix of string sizes, tend to keep them around for awhile, <i>and</i> you do a lot of manipulations on those strings, you pay the branch-misprediction cost over and over.",1438401835

While narcissism like in your extract can be considered part of the dark triad, it seems like you&#x27;ve decided the OP is also a narcissist with little to no evidence to back it up. Then again, I can only guess at what you&#x27;re getting at when your only statement (argument?) is a quote from a piece of fiction.<p>Working out regularly does not make you a narcissist. In fact, he doesn&#x27;t even specify the exercises he does. For all we know, he goes jogging to help boost his cardiovascular health, rather than pumping iron. And even if he did pump iron, let him. It&#x27;s what he wants to do, and it doesn&#x27;t make him a psycho.",1387990766

The options the company has are thus:<p>A: Put Laura into a job that doesn&#x27;t add any value to the company, and encourage Laura to retrain as a CPA. It&#x27;s possible that Laura might be perfectly happy as a bookkeeper, and might not want to retrain. Also since the company needs a CPA immediately, the CPA job isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be open if Laura finally does retrain, so the company would be asking for a big commitment from Laura with no promised reward at the end.<p>B: Give Laura a generous severance and a great reference, and help her find a job that is a reasonable &quot;next step&quot; for her in her career.)",1387990424

I’m honoured to have a chance to speak with you and your family this year.<p>Recently we learned that our governments, working in concert, have created a system of world-wide mass surveillance – watching everything we do.<p>Great Britain’s George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information. The types of collection in the book – microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person. A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They’ll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that’s a problem because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.<p>The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel asking is always cheaper than spying.<p>For everyone out there listening – Thank you and Merry Christmas.",1387989788

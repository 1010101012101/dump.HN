In fact, these days I would say success depends more on the VC(s) involved than the founders.  Mark Cuban was at least half-right when he compared tech investments to a Ponzi scheme (<a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/08/15/mark-cuban-this-tech-vc-bubble-is-like-a-ponzi-scheme/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/08/15/mark-cuban-th...</a>).<p>This is, obviously, a generalization -- there are a few companies that stand on their own feet, and have even done so without outside investment.  But in the majority of cases it seems like startups are acquired because some kind of ""inside"" deal is going on.  When you think about it, most companies rarely benefit from acquisitions and mergers - instead they slowly die.  To list a few: AOL, Bebo, Myspace, Flip, Map Quest, Alta Vista, Netscape, Broadcast.com, Excite, Lycos, Ask Jeeves, Sun Microsystems...<p>What startups are still going strong post-acquisition? I can think of Youtube off the top of my head...what else?  If the parent companies are (generally) not benefiting from acquisitions, why are they happening?",1316933691

3035275,comment,3035037,3035037,1,0,6ren,,,"Re: predicting it based on qualities of the founders: pg has said determination is very important - based on data from startups, it turned out much more important than anticipated. Therefore, one would expect an objective measure of determination to have (some) predictive power. Maybe not as much as the present YC process; but it would be hard data, and a new perspective which might be revealing. Certainly, scientific at least!<p>It sounds like a sloppy thing to measure; but Martin Seligman (learned helplessness/learned optimism) has quizzes to measure optimism/pessimism, which have experimentally demonstrated predictive power (and actually have been used to supplement job interviewing, with measurable success). So measuring determination might be possible. There's even checks to prevent/detect cheating. Of course, extra smart candidates with million dollar (VC) motivation may quickly subvert any a test. Still, it would be interesting, intellectually, to see if it did work.<p>Might also be interesting to ask one of Seligman's students to assess YC candidates for optimism (his definition means that you bounce back from failure with energy - e.g. a pivot). It seems plausible to me that that would also be predictive of startup success (and also predictive of determination - the ability to keep going).",1316932933

3035270,comment,3035195,3035195,2,0,law,,,"Absence of malicious history/intent doesn't render them incapable of being (directly or indirectly) dangerous. One could easily pose a rational argument for users to take prophylactic measures (e.g., Facebook Disconnect, Ghostery, and the other browser plug-ins) based solely on the increasing number of data breaches.[1][2]<p>However, this is a relatively weak argument, as it requires making an underlying assumption that the leaked data is dangerous. We have no evidence to support the assertion that leaked information of the kind shared on Facebook would pose any danger to the affected users. This is fundamentally different from the dangers of data breaches concerning health and financial records; these records contain information necessary to steal identities and engage in other nefarious operations. Facebook doesn't collect social security numbers or other extremely sensitive personally identifiable information.<p>Facebook does, however, collect evidence of our predispositions and predilections. Arguably, this information is far more dangerous than mere personally identifiable information, because rather than identifying us outright, it gets to the heart of what makes each of us unique. We are incapable of imagining the complete set of scenarios where this information could be used nefariously, and as such, its dangers fall within the scope of ``unknown unknowns''<p>Compare this situation to the case of a breach of financial data: the uses of this data are well-enumerated, and one could argue that the cost of the next health information data breach is a known unknown. Based on historical evidence, we know that another breach will occur, and we know how criminals use the leaked information. With data on Facebook, however, we don't know whether this information could be used maliciously. Moreover, if it could be used maliciously, we don't know how it might be used. Therefore, it deserves as much privacy (if not more) as one's financial and health records.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/lib_survey/ITRC_2008_Breach_List.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/lib_survey/ITRC...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach</a>",1316932808

The problem I see is that we are becoming even more and more leveraged/dependent on technology. And these technologies are increasingly interdependent. A successful attack on one technology can potentially bring down entire systems down in unanticipated ways.<p>The recent power outage in San Diego and nearby areas serves as a good reminder. You don't actively think about power, it is something you take for granted. Only when the power is lost, then you realize how dependent everything is on it; traffic lights stopped, ATMs didn't work, credit and debit cards didn't work, freezers and fridges stopped, and so forth. From modern times to the dark ages in an eye-blink, instant paralysis.<p>I don't think nuclear power plants as targets are that interesting. Just turning off traffic light system would be enough to bring down and entire US urban area down to its knees.<p>New networks of complex dependencies are being created all the time. The smartphone boom is going to create one, and people will start relying on the existence of it. If iPhone and Android keep dominating the market it will create more homogenous mass of devices, providing a more consistent attack surface and more potential for widespread damage. I don't see how smartphones could avoid the same problems PCs were/are experiencing. Waiting for the first smartphone ""UNIX worm"".<p>Wireless features are getting added to cars. Yet another potential complex network. War-driving could soon get completely new meanings.",1316932732

3035220,comment,3034573,3035133,10,0,sgentle,,,"I think that would be a fair way to summarise it, but be careful not to reduce something to obviousness and then say it's too simple.<p>The interesting point for me is that much of startup marketing wisdom seems to say ""make things people want"", whereas there's another school that says ""make people want things"" - aka the Blue Ocean strategy and kin. How is it that both of these things can exist? Why did Google succeed by beating the dead search horse? Why did Twitter succeed at selling SMS-meets-chat-meets-blog-meets-I'm-on-acid?<p>Likely everyone with an eye to marketing has some sense of a rubber band connecting the ambition to the zeitgeist. You can pull the market with you a little, but go too far and you lose it. It is, in fact, quite a popular idea that Twitter and Google just happened to be in the right place at the right time.<p>But ""right place at the right time"" is a bit hand-wavy and qualitative. Perhaps it would be better to find a more structured way of thinking about it. That, to me, is the point of this article - not so much Greek calves or the order of growth curves.<p>What if the success of the lean startup movement isn't that it lets you develop faster, but rather that it forces you to develop slower. That is, that by bringing customers and product closer, it prevents you from stretching the rubber band too far. If so, perhaps you could yield better results by reallocating effort from product iterations into determining and exploiting those limits.<p>I suspect where Venkat is going is that instead of asking ""what do people want?"" on one side and ""how can we make them want it more?"" on the other, you could treat marketing and development as being simultaneous complementary processes; much as a good video game will always present content at the limit of your skill, you could position your product at the limit of customer tolerance for change.<p>My guess: this was all inspired by Facebook's hilarious mismanagement of that limit.<p>However, I'm in agreement with the other commenters: major weak sauce that this wasn't examined further. Since when did Ribbon Farm leave the apple cart wheels-down? Conflict-averse indeed!",1316931223

3035216,comment,3032403,3034215,1,0,Gatsky,,,"I disagree with all your points. I think the main reason for differences in salary is that it is easy to measure what a radiologist does. It is also relatively easy to measure what a cardiologist does, particularly if they are doing procedures such as angiograms.<p>Mostly a neurologist diagnoses stuff and manages chronic disease, and how do you measure that? Arguably, the neurologist does the most difficult and complicated job. They get paid based on consultations per time, which is clearly a pretty hopeless measure.<p>Also, the notion that radiology is going to be automated by increased processor power is a bit ridiculous.<p>We are talking about a task where lives are at stake, communication and DISCUSSION with real people is required frequently, and there are large variations in the quality and modality of scanning.<p>Also, any data driven approach is very limited... what happens when a new MRI sequence is developed? We have to wait 15 years for real radiologists to do enough reporting so we can get a proper dataset?",1316930992

Sentiment has been turning anti-FB for quite some time; it's been aggravated by FB's blunders in the past, by defaulting to over-invasiveness, then dialing back in response to outcry. So whenever FB gets press for something that can be viewed in the same light, there's a lot of judging them by their past actions.<p>So while there may be an element of opportunism in covert anti-FB PR, it's working with dry kindling.

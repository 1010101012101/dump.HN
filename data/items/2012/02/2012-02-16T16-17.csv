3599530,comment,3598965,3599391,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"The US courts do place weight on the ""it's patenting a mathematical formula"" argument. There's some nuance and murk, but an application will probably have to pass the ""Machine or Transformation Test"" to be patentable:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-or-transformation_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-or-transformation_test</a><p>Essentially, software implementations of algorithms cannot generally be patented either because they are simply an expression of the algorithm in a particular language.  The fact that this language can be interpreted by a particular hardware device does not change the situation. The hardware is a pre-existing piece of general-purpose commodity hardware that is easily interchangeable with any number of other pre-existing pieces of general-purpose commodity hardware, up to and including a human being equipped with a pen and paper, and therefore cannot really be claimed as part of the patent.<p>A physical device which implements the algorithm can, of course, be patented.  And a hardware/software combination where the computer is an integral part of the mechanism (e.g., it cannot in principle be replicated by a human with a pen and paper) can also be patented, so Amazon's 'One-Click' patent is safe. However, simply tacking on the phrase, ""Written in a programming language,"" does not take an unpatentable idea and make it patentable.",1329411446

Windows 8 is a real risk-take from a company that does not take risks (whether they were forced to do so or not is another argument). Mac OS X is...

Why? Because anyone who can't figure out how to flip that switch shouldn't be installing unsigned binaries, in my opinion.<p>In regards to OSX, the argument seems to be that this is a step towards not even having the switch there, and yes, they may be headed that way which is unfortunate. I think that's a mistake that would end up biting them if they tried it, but maybe I'm naive.

But these rights haven't actually been established as 'rights' - which might need to change - which makes them just consumer demands on your part.  It seems to me as though we've reached the point where piracy makes them make more repressive DRM, which makes more people pirate, which gives them more legal ammo to make more repressive DRM and lobby for laws, etc. and so on to infinity or until the laws change.  You can see why I don't choose to be a part of this cycle.<p>Besides, the reason artists sign contracts is the same reason game developers go work for companies like Ubisoft who then make their games use repressive DRM that they completely disagree with - that is the industry we have, and they'd rather be a part of it, making money and exercising their talents, than standing on the outside struggling to get by while they rage against the machine.  It's not their fault the current institution is set up the way it is.<p>Also, I'm pretty sure if Honda sold a car that only worked on Route 66, people would just not buy it, but I feel the comparison doesn't completely do it all justice because we've long argued that physical goods are not equivalent to digital media, otherwise piracy would be stealing instead of... well, piracy.",1329410764

Are you saying otherwise?<p>As you've decided to pick anonymous security experts, I thought I'd chip in. I don't know if I'd call myself an expert but I've over a decade in industry breaking systems, fixing software and booting out bad guys, I'm speaking at BlackHat EU next month and I co-founded a security conference so I guess that means I'm not a complete security chump. I can categorically tell you that signed binaries are only part of a strategy, and not necessarily the best one at that. If your goal is to increase the cost of exploitation then signing can help, but so can a decent access control model (into which signing becomes a part thereof).<p>To put it another way, it's possible to defeat applocker (windows binary signing), iOS code signing on iOS 5.0.1, the XBox and Xbox 360's code signing restrictions, the PS3's code signing restrictions, and more recently, an analysis of RSA keys showed that between 2 and 4 out of every thousand keys are insecure due to weak randomness[1].<p>The bottom line is that code signing, like placebos only work if you believe them to unless they're backed up by something more solid to augment them and they form a stronger coherent strategy.<p>At this stage all code signing settings will do is encourage developers to get Apple IDs and for customers to use the App store as they know ""it's safe"". Even though we know it doesn't mean anything[2] to the end user in reality. The real thing that Apple will do is further on the line when they decide to make it so that you can only run signed apps (and this is at least the direction apple are taking) through their app store.<p>Your edge case point applies to countless open source developers, including those that worked on the original FreeBSD code that went into Darwin. Apple are of course, under the licences they've inheritied allowed to implement code signing, but please don't think this is an anti-malware measure, it isn't. It's about control of distribution. Anyone that wants to bypass code signing on an Apple product will find a way to do it.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/crypto_security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/crypto_security/</a>

It's <i>way</i> too easy to simply wave Apple off as expensive baubles for image-conscious, vain consumers.<p>> <i>""but it wouldn't matter much to them if the brand wasn't known at all.""</i><p>But yet, it would. Consumers can feel quality when they come upon it. The LV bag without the luxury branding would still be far more successfully than a bag of lesser-quality and equally nameless brand.<p>Going back to what I started mentioning with the last post - a product is perceived at 3 levels. Visceral, behavioral, and reflective. We've already covered the visceral part.<p>Behavioral is the actual function of the product. How quickly does the kettle boil water? Does that teapot drip when poured? Does my phone actually send the SMS or will it leave me in limbo with no confirmation?<p>Reflective is the higher, consciously engaging aspect of the product. Does it make me look good to my peers? Does it bring back memories of a bygone era? Does it appeal to my ego? etc etc.<p>You're positing the Apple's claim to success can be largely accounted for via the reflective angle - whereas I'm saying it's <i>impossible</i> to be successful on that angle alone. A truly legendary product is <i>wildly</i> successful at all 3, and executing on all 3 is what has powered Apple's meteoric rise.<p>Android in its current state really nails behavioral, but it's half-assing visceral, and the reflective is practically non-existent.<p>Not from your post, but to aggregate my reply.

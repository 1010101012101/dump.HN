I did emphasize tool making.\nI should also have mentioned team formation\nfor hunting, building, and fighting.  E.g., hunting\nis not nearly all size and strength but heavily\nunderstanding how to locate and kill the prey.\nAnd if the hunting is with a team, then need to\nbe good at forming teams.<p>So, the women were back in the village concentrating\non child care, food, and clothing, and the men\nwere generating fire, tools, wheels, things made\nof bone, wood, and stone, making progress with metals,\n..., a server farm with 20,000 computers.  That was\nmen&#x27;s work, done by men, in ways convenient for men,\nthat used talents of men, apparently from hunting,\ntool making, team formation, and fighting, that \nchanged the economy, government, and societies.\nAlas, women mostly didn&#x27;t participate and mostly\nstill don&#x27;t.<p>Look, there&#x27;s a recent study about boys and girls\nshortly after birth.  The girls are working on\ncommunicating with adults, especially about how\nthey feel, mostly with facial expressions.\nThe boys are looking at the construction of the\ncrib, trying to figure out how the latch works,\nand wanting to write C++ code to control the\ntoy fire engine on the floor!  That&#x27;s right\nfrom birth.  The boys care about things, tools,\nstrategy, etc., and the girls care about\neliciting support from people.  That&#x27;s just\nthe way it is.<p>In simple terms, the girls have plenty of\nstrength for most tool making and for\nteam formation, but mostly they just\ndidn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t do it.  That&#x27;s just not\nwhat girls are interested in, and there&#x27;s\nlittle promise they will be interested \nduring our <i>knowledge worker</i> society.<p>Girls don&#x27;t want to think about tricky\nalgorithms; some girls actually can, but\nstill they don&#x27;t want to.  They just\ndon&#x27;t.  &quot;Fools give you reasons;\nwise men never try.&quot;  What girls want\nto do is to gossip as a way to be\na member of a group of girls and to\nattract boys.  They like to be asked\nto do things so that when they do them\nthey can get praise, acceptance, approval,\nand emotional security.",1382752780

6615907,comment,6609586,6611904,2,0,thibauts,,,"Very interesting. I feel like the very concept of a grammar is only a model we cast on language to make it easier to deal with. Langage is pretty free and can work without it. Grammar feels to me like a normalization &quot;by contract&quot;. We normalize, then study the normalization tool itself without being aware it is an artefact. We model the model, give it free parameters, randomness, serendipity to make it accomodate reality and its endless string of special cases. We even try to separate meaning from experience.<p>This all feels more like a network of relations and probabilities of coocurrence of various (free?) orders. I followed your link and I strongly feel the suffix &quot;grammar&quot; is the real burden here. We&#x27;re trying to put structure on what is actually creating it.",1382752695

Any, and I repeat, any of the <i></i>problems<i></i> encountered with a computer or the internet, can easily be more attributable to the human condition, and the way our civilization and organizations work. It&#x27;s the exact same argument as guns don&#x27;t kill people.<p>Lets take the title as an assertion, and see if holds any ground when asked as a question. So the assertions are: &quot;The internet hurts your sleep schedule, productivity and personal life&quot;<p><i>The internet hurts your sleep schedule?</i><p>First of all, what&#x27;s the internet? Is it a physical object? No it is not. Does it force me to interact with it? No. People or myself may force me to use it however. When I look into the science, it tells me that what really affects your sleep, is bright lights close to your face. This actually seems like more of a problem with display screens and is more of a criticism of our modern, electrical society, which is fine. This doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s the Internet&#x27;s fault though.<p><i>The internet hurts your productivity?</i><p>Hah. So where are we getting our data from? From before the internet was invented? Yes? Well No. Actually the data is more about what a time sink on average, certain services are <i>on</i> the internet. Again, what&#x27;s the internet?? Unfortunately people use whatever definition suits them. Again, all I&#x27;ll say is the problems are most likely born from personal or social pressures or vices or defects, and while I may agree to more accurate phrase (Facebook hurts your productivity), the internet is where I and many others make their living everyday. To generalize it as unproductive is just incorrect.<p><i>The internet hurts your personal life?</i><p>If you let it hurt your personal life, or you let someone use the internet, and that person hurts your personal life, then I guess you could argue a more exacting phrase (My naked photos being on the internet hurts my personal life). But then again, with such a general definition of internet, then a fair retort is the evidence we have of people&#x27;s personal lives being improved everyday because of the internet. Girl dying of cancer? Reddit donates to her in a caring creative way. Veteran needs some love on their B-day? /b/ from 4chan has over 10 people attend and give the man company. The internet is keeping you single because of anime and porn? The internet got this guy a girl friend and a job in Cologne.<p>It&#x27;s like your said earlier: Does it matter? No. Because people are different, technology is agnostic to our anthropomorphism, and all of our problems stem from humans, human groups, or human civilization.",1382751074

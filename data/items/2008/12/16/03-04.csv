399165,comment,398692,398828,0,0,jrockway,,,"The article misses one key point in favor of web-based applications -- you don't need Apple's permission to write one.  Writing an iPhone app consists of agreeing to an EULA to get the SDK, then writing the app with proprietary APIs and arbitrary restrictions (you can't call this function; you can't use a language that allows code modification at runtime[1]), and then finally gambling on whether or not Apple will approve it.  If they don't like it, all your work is wasted.<p>If you write a web app, you have none of these problems, and you don't have to share your revenue with Apple.<p>[1] As anyone knows, this is not technically possible.  Are config files or preference settings ""code""?  Why not?  And what about languages that allow putting shellcode on the heap and overwriting the saved instruction pointer with its address... like, say, Objective-C?",1229399571

He, and to a lesser extent this article, basically summed it up as ""it will help you learn to do boring stuff well"".<p>Are we CS majors really such mindless brutes that topics such as history, philosophy, religion, literature, etc., are automatically snore-fests that we complete just to make good grades? I'm just really confused how these people can have a seemingly complete lack of interest in the humanities.",1229398373

399143,comment,398597,399115,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Two pieces of unsolicited advice:<p>1. You make your own choices, and there's always tradeoffs.  It sounds like you've decided that a busy internship and a high load class schedule are more important to you than working on a startup.  Own that decision...you'll own the consequences.  If you don't feel it's the right path, change it.<p>2. Be careful about telling yourself someday...it can easily turn into never.  Not saying there's not better times for some things than others, but lean towards taking messy plunges rather than waiting for the stars to align.",1229397295

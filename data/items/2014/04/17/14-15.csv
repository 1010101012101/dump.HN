7603956,comment,7603302,7603474,5,0,exratione,,,"Not really. Actuarial escape velocity is a concept that emerges from the SENS proposals [0]. Next to nothing you do with your life has truly significant expected impact on your future longevity other than providing support and funding for SENS and SENS-like research aimed at repairing the root causes of all the big killer age-related conditions.<p>(Less significant here means a ten year swing in life expectancy. Exercise, not smoking, calorie restriction - these are things that can make 5-10 year expected differences. Everything else is pretty marginal if you exclude the obvious exogenous line items like risk of accident. But an improving implementation of SENS provides indefinite extension of healthy life out to the expected limits due to accident rates, which is somewhere in the 1000-5000 year range for present data).<p>The mainstream medical research community is largely focused on patching late stage manifestations of aging. Most work and funding goes towards either manipulating proximate causes rather than root causes, or trying to find ways to alter the operation of metabolism to make the disease process less terrible - but again without addressing causes. Until such time as the research community is overtaken by the &quot;address root causes&quot; disruption currently taking place, of which SENS is an exemplar, but by no means the only movement, then progress towards extended life and defeat of age-related disease will continue to be painfully expensive, slow, and marginal.<p>The trends in life extension achieved through medicine to date are all largely incidental, unintentional. Where aging itself as a collection of processes [1] has been slowed it wasn&#x27;t because that was the deliberate intent. Again, because until very recently no-one has been trying to address aging itself rather than focusing on the nature of its outcomes. It is the same difference as that between working to reverse or prevent rust in metal structures versus working on repairing structural failures that occur due to that rust.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC423155/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC423155/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a>",1397746727

His point -- &quot;your existing site doesn&#x27;t look good enough to convince my boss&quot; -- is very valid. The new site looks a lot better and it&#x27;s not done yet.<p>It does in fact scale pretty darn well, mostly due to the fact that it&#x27;s connectionless, stateless, and opportunistic. If you&#x27;re on a network with ten million people but are only talking to ten, you&#x27;ll only be sending packets to/from ten.<p>The supernodes have to know about all ten million, but last I checked that wasn&#x27;t very much memory... maybe a few gigs tops? So that&#x27;s what, $20-$30/month per node? Or I could add the ability to put a real database under it and use SSD cloud nodes and handle billions of users with sub-10-ms lookup latency.<p>Of course if I get that many users that&#x27;ll all be in the good problem to have category and I&#x27;ll have plenty of money to scale out and if necessary improve the protocol/architecture. There are many directions I could explore: M:N supernodes with load balancing, various other sharding techniques, moving to beefier cloud providers, further decentralization in the protocol, all of the above, etc. I could set up big labs, run simulations, do all sorts of cool stuff. I&#x27;ve done enough so far to convince me that the problem of monstrously scaling this thing is very solvable. Just have to do the work.<p>I&#x27;m not making the crypto fungible. The protocol does have flags that could be used to indicate new algorithms if upgrading the crypto becomes necessary, but I have been an absolute simplicity nazi with this thing so far and will continue to be.",1397746697

If you had a secondary then the lookup would pass to there so the right (but currently non-functioning) address would be given to the MTA, it would fail to connect and drop the message back into the queue for a later retry.<p>It is rare it makes any difference these days (many agents that were sensitive to this, such as mail servers, no longer are because it is quite common for small arrangement not to have secondary DNS and for ISPs to break DNS in the name of making an extra penny here or there) but it is still worth having an externally hosted secondary DNS host even if everything else is a single point of failure for all (hosted on one box on one link). For a small home concern it needn&#x27;t cost more than ten or fifteen $/year either to run your own bind instance in a inexpensive VPS or to use a specialist DNS service.<p>I run most things from home too, but have external resources (a backup location and a web service that occasionally needs more bandwidth then the outgoing link at home can comfortably provide) so my secondary services sit out there with them.",1397746026

In the same way, you have a guy that is pretty strong at Unix administration, a language lawyer, some people that are big into UIs and such.<p>So while people will probably dedicate 80% of a week to a given kind of task, they can, and do, play multiple roles, depending on how much their specific expertise is needed that week.<p>For instance, I am the number one choice on UIs, but I also play support managing Postgres, because I did a whole lot of that in a past life, and we don&#x27;t need a full time DBA. I am also leveling up in our scheduling system, all Akka actors.<p>At my previous job, the team had all the Database experience it needed, but domain knowledge was weak, so I spent much of my work working with users trying to figure out what they needed, and why they were unhappy with the product.

The same goes for governments. It&#x27;s a trial and error process that goes back to the beginning of life. There is an anaology I really enjoy which relates the idea of saving economy and markets from the natural process of failing:<p>&quot;In the 1970s the US developed a policy of forestry that espoused 100% prevention of forest fires; let’s call it “fire is not an option”. This policy resulted in the systemic suppression of small fires and eventually into very unbalanced forest ecosystems where fire is now not just an option, but a certainty of disaster. We now know that fire is a natural part of a forest’s life-cycle. Without fire, the forest floor gets overgrown, making it a source for bigger and hotter fires. When fires break out in a “managed” forest where fires have been suppressed for years, they burn so hot they turn the ground to glass. Fires that were survivable by trees are now so destructive that they denude hills and wipe out the entire ecosystem. Our financial system has become much like a poorly managed forest, harboring within it the increasing probability of a systemic and destructive conflagration.&quot;<p>Just as no single person knows how to create a pencil, no single person, or group of powerful individuals, have any idea of the complexities that exist when deciding how to guide an economy.

In my opinion though, the schemaless design of MongoDB paired with its ease of use and its native support of JSON data makes it a perfect choice for prototyping and (in some cases) a viable option for use in production.<p>What you also have to consider when comparing document-oriented to relational databases is that the former is still a very young technology: MongoDB has been founded in 2007, whereas Postgres has been around since 1986! So given what the MongoDB team has achieved in such a short time span, I expect to see some huge improvements in this technology over the next decade, especially given the large amount of funding that 10gen received.<p>In addition, the root cause for most complaints (&quot;it doesn&#x27;t scale!&quot;, &quot;it loses my data!&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s not consistent!&quot;) is that people try to apply design patterns from relational databases to MongoDB, which often is just a horrible idea. Document databases and relational databases are very different beasts and need to be handled very differently: Most design patterns for relational databases (data normalization, using joins to group data, using flat data structures, scaling vertically instead of horizontally) are actually anti-patterns in the non-relational world.

You have two pools of inbred (100% or near homozygous) plants, you cross pollinate them and they have very uniform results because they have pretty uniform genetics and have &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;. The next generation (what the farmer harvests) has likely been open air pollinated has a garbled mess of genetics and will therefore underperform if planted.

It&#x27;s not relevant.)<p>Once you have a national reputation and can get $250+ per hour consulting rates, you can live whereever you want. It takes a while to get there. Most people have to put in their decade in a congested, expensive, and not very pleasant region of the country before getting there (and some never do).<p>As for remote work, it has the same issues.

That does not mean that anything we do is a good idea.<p>People who don&#x27;t understand how systems work often jump to decentralization as a solution to any problem. I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe they&#x27;ve been burned in the past by a centralized service, and think the best solution is to remove what they perceived as their roadblock: the centralization.<p>Our current situation is nothing like traveling. You sit in your home, or in your car, or at your work, or in a park, or on an airplane, and you can access anything you want anywhere in the world, instantly. There&#x27;s virtually no time between wanting to read your letter and receiving it. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s uncomplicated. And you don&#x27;t have to prove your identity if you&#x27;ve done it once in the past 30 days. Do you realize how that is possible? None of that is due to decentralized services. Every single service you use on the web is provided via centralized services. And they work <i>beautifully.</i><p>Your wireless card listens for access point probes. It hears one from the AP it wants, and it connects. The AP begins the process of creating an encrypted connection. It checks that your credentials are valid, or passes the request up to a RADIUS server, that holds all the valid credentials of all the users. It then establishes the connection. Your host polls for a DHCP server asking for a lease, and the DHCP server, diligently making sure no leases have a conflict, gives you all the local network information you&#x27;ll need. Your client sends a DNS request to the DNS server, which resolves, caches, and returns your request by polling the closest possible upstream DNS server, giving you a result that&#x27;s geographically closest to you. Your browser initiates a connection, across your AP, across the cable modem, across the DSLAM, across the POP, across the MAN, across the many myriad routers, switches, traffic filters, interlinks, to finally get to the load balancers that maintain a balance of requests between the web servers of your destination. The HTTPS session is established after you verify the server is who they say they are, and then you tell the server who you are over HTTP, finally asking for your letter, and receiving it. And each route long the way has its gateway configured and routing tables filled with curated BGP tables so that they know <i>exactly</i> where to send your data to get you from a cable modem in Indiana to a datacenter in Brazil.<p>What would happen if we replaced every one of those centralized services with a decentralized model?<p>For one thing, you&#x27;d have less bandwidth and higher latency. All the devices on the internet would be constantly communicating, trying to find consensus, trying to update routes, trying to search distributed rings (my personal favorite topology) to find peers, connect services, authenticate trust relationships, query data, update indexes, etc. To say nothing of the potential for disruption of networks by various attacks or the difficulty of troubleshooting a random network failure in a massive decentralized network.<p>For another, storing data on your own host in your own home is taking 100 steps backward. As a very simple comparison, it&#x27;s like taking your valuables out of a safe deposit box in an FDIC-insured bank and putting them on the front dash of your car. Even besides the security concerns, if you have a fire in your house, there goes your data! It&#x27;s just a really dangerous idea to put data you care about in a place that&#x27;s easily available to thieves and isn&#x27;t backed up to an offsite location and maintained by professionals. That&#x27;s what centralized services were meant to provide. It makes no sense to try and support those scenarios in a decentralized way, because the very idea of decentralized services is contrary to high-availability data.<p>Final thought: we put a man on the moon with centralized services. If we had done it using decentralized services, it would have taken a lot longer than it did with a lot more work, for exactly the same result. Sometimes it just makes more sense to be centralized.",1397744649

It&#x27;s correct that SXF (and BER) are in another country (Landkreis Dahme-Spreewald, LDS) and don&#x27;t belong to Berlin which would ordinarily imply that the SXF Airport is not part of the area where Taxis from Berlin have to drop you off and that Taxis from Berlin would not be allowed to pick up passengers at the SXF airport for the return trip to Berlin (and the other way round, Taxis from LDS could not pick up passengers in Berlin for the return trip). Since that is obviously an unacceptable situation the &quot;Berlin&quot; area was expanded to include the airport and that LDS-based taxis could pick up passengers in Berlin in return. It used to be that the fee was slightly different depending on where the taxi was based, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the last years.<p>The reason TXL is cheaper is mainly because it&#x27;s closer, SXF is pretty far out and BER is even further out.

Right now there are some bugs in the system, some improvements that need to be made, and definitely some default configurations that need to be changed before it&#x27;s going to be a consistent database.

I&#x27;m currently building a rapid development platform for these kinds of systems, where users can define an arbitrary relational data model from a Web-UI and get the application with forms and views all pre-made. The user design is changeable at any point without breaking anything and even the underlying static data structures can be changed without any need for an update or data migration process - it&#x27;s all handled when opening or saving a document with a previous version.<p>- CouchDB&#x27;s map/reduce view definitions are interesting when designing a DB system, since they IMO restrict the developer in exactly the right way: One is forced to write the right kind of index views instead of being able to just join willy nilly. Making something slow usually means writing complex views and chaining many lookups together - one has to work for it and, conversely, being lazy and reducing everything to the simplest solution usually results in a fast solution as well. The result usually scales up to a high number of documents in terms of performance.<p>- Being able to replicate without any precondition, including to mobile devices with TouchDB, is a big plus - and in fact a requirement in our case. Offline access is still important, especially in countries where people spend a lot of time in trains or for systems that manager types want to be accessing in flight.",1397743356

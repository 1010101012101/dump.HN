The information specifying those functions must necessarily be embodied within some physical substrate in order for an agent to operate within a physical domain. And thus, an optimally programmed Turing machine should be capable of ultimately ascertaining the utility function of a given agent when provided the states of the agent&#x27;s constitutive variables. Once the utility function is derived from that information, it should be possible to predict the agent&#x27;s preference with respect to various possible states of the universe. Solomonoff induction provides (at least) one means of converting that information into a probability distribution.",1442203106

10213550,comment,10212519,10212519,0,0,ClintEhrlich,,,"One of the reasons for similarities in Hollywood is that outright theft is quite common. Historically, it has been very difficult to prove damages to the necessary degree of certainty.<p>This problem would be mitigated if more jurisdictions allowed liquidated-damages clauses in contracts to be enforced on a consistent basis. Unfortunately, most attempts at liquidating damages fail because courts usually characterize them as unlawful penalties.<p>Judge Richard Posner, the most cited jurist of the last century, argues that sophisticated parties should be permitted to liquidate damages however they want, regardless of whether a court believes their agreement was reasonable. &quot;The reason for the [contrary] rule is mysterious,&quot; he says, &quot;it is one of the abiding mysteries of the common law.&quot;<p>In the 1970s, businesses in California persuaded the California legislature to amend the relevant statute to create a rebuttable presumption that liquidated-damages clauses were lawful. Yet the Courts were so attached to the underlying rule that it made no difference! The California Supreme Court has inexplicably extended the very lines of authority that the legislature explicitly intended to override.<p>I was involved in litigation that involved the red-handed theft of a pitch by the American division of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate. According to the terms of the liquidated-damages clause that the parties adopted, this theft would cost more than $120 million dollars. After years and years of litigation, with back-and-forth rulings, it was finally declared unenforceable. The firm whose pitch was stolen lost the chance for a life-changing opportunity, which may have cost it a hecto-million dollars or more.<p>Until there is some realistic way to protect artistic ideas, whether through contract or state fiat, imitation will prevail over innovation, because the rewards are simply inaccessible to most outsiders. The means of production are owned by the existing Hollywood elite, and they simply steal whatever novel ideas newcomers develop.<p>Please note: I am NOT advocating more stringent patent laws — or even stricter copyrights! People who are inspired by public ideas should be free to incorporate them in their art. But private parties also need the ability to disclose non-public ideas, without forfeiting their value. At least in Hollywood, right now they do not. And before that changes, expect the <i>status quo</i>.",1442201635

If it is gently poked, it will return to its “stable position”. But a slightly more forceful poke will topple it.

But I think there is very little practical benefit to making these documents slightly more accessible to people who don&#x27;t even have enough stake in them to justify the $3.00 max per document PACER fee.

However, they are not something you can prescribe directly.  Just like you can&#x27;t use design patterns like ordering off of a menu (I&#x27;ll have a bowl full of factories, a side order of singletons and a large bridge, please), you can&#x27;t pick a handful of &quot;best practices&quot;, sew them together and expect that, in itself, to make you successful.<p>Being aware of best practices gives you the ability to move in that direction when you see opportunities.  It is a mistake, in my opinion, to try to force the opportunities by dictating best practices (something that is done far too often in software process engineering).  The best practice you choose depends a lot on the situation and the people involved.<p>Having said that, I have all too often been in situations where I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;I know how to be successful if we could do X, Y, and Z.  I have <i>absolutely</i> no idea how to be successful doing the things we are doing now.&quot;  It&#x27;s tempting to try and force people&#x27;s hands, but I have never seen it work.

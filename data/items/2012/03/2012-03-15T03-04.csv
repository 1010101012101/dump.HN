1. it's not sticky 
2. it's value proposition is relatively low<p>When it launched I played around with it for a few weeks before eventually uninstalling. Reason being, when you can check-in to places via FourSquare, recommend food/items you like from restaurants via Yelp, why would you use a system like Oink (especially when it has a smaller social-footprint than the aforementioned services)?<p>Maybe this app was awesome for you Bay area folks, but in NYC I never found much when I used the find nearby feature. Their interface was also inundated with too many data points as well (see there item detail screen).<p>I think the next wave of apps, now that we're experiencing check-in fatigue, is ""passive utility"" apps (Highlight, Sonar, etc). Their value can be ascertained with little friction (literally all you have to do is walk by someone) and there's tremendous room expansion on its core concept (dating based on shared interests, linkedin introductions based on shared contacts, etc.).",1331783984

Celebrity has little to do with teaching ability.<p>It's not like he's popular for being snooki's best friend or something .. I feel Peter Norvig is a celebrity for the right reasons here.. there are two types of teachers - those who get you to see the world in interesting ways, and those who illuminate targets that one wouldn't hit normally on one's own. I'm guessing Norvig's course might be more of the latter type..<p>> ..  but one of the best things about going to college was getting to know smart and interesting people 
personally, I feel 'getting to know' is not enough. As math ematicians/scientists or techies or programmers, our peer group /culture is our identity, and pretty much the main reason we wake up in the morning and check email for patch updates or stay up till 5 running code and what not.
yep, online courses don't give that. And I too badly feel the need  for it<p>tl;dr  first point - disagree, second point - agree

That point is that if he loses $500K, he only has to pay $400K of it. I'm pretty sure that if you bet $100K a hand, and stop whenever you hit the first of +$500K or -$500K, and get a $100K rebate if you hit the lower number ... well, the whole plan would seem to have a positive expected value. And perhaps the same would be true even with a bet increment of $10K or less,<p>Second, it is strongly implied (without details being given) that he has negotiated rules giving him an unusually favorable expected value per hand -- either a very slightly negative one (which would explain why Tropicana is willing to keep playing with him), or perhaps even a positive one that they keep overlooking. The only rule I saw in there that sounds odd to me is ""calling the hand"" -- is that a recent twist to blackjack or something?",1331781654

In the eyes of a DRM writer, a game needs to be protected for at least a few weeks (launch purchase window), and once it's cracked once, it's pretty much the end - the game is in the wild, and the damage is done, because what's being pirated is <i>the game itself</i>.<p>On the flip side, what satellite providers are protecting isn't really the <i>content</i> - it's the ability to display the content in at a certain point of presence as a stream. Public exhibition (bars, clubs) and live PPV fights are the big game for satellite encryption, not Joe Public (or Joe Pirate) watching his shows. They'll be available to pirates immediately after they're aired through other means (stations, screeners, stripping HDCP off of HDMI) anyway.<p>That's why I think the satellite game is easier - not technically, but practically.

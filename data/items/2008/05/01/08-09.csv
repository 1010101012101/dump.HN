At the same point, if a VC funds a company, and nothing catastrophic happens in one year, they're not selling at 2x. To do so would invalidate their original judgment.<p>I'm sure it occurred to Vinod Khosla and the guys at Xobni that Microsoft might one day implement their functionality.

178252,comment,178092,178092,0,0,phaedrus,,,"In Oklahoma it seems to be more like $40K.  :(  When I went to make some job applications, I realized none of my professors gave any of the new CS graduates any advice on what salary to ask for.  It's a moot point because I'm not convinced there <i>are</i> any CS jobs out here.  I'm graduating top in my class, have 3 years experience working at a (folded) software development startup, and I've even done a NASA intership - and even with a resume like that I haven't even so much as gotten an interview yet:  the job market out here is just so low-tech...",1209632198

178250,comment,177859,178199,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well it has advantages and disadvantages. You can get $5m from a VC round while only giving up the same amount of equity you would to take $0.5m from angels. At the same time, you drastically reduce your potential exits by limiting yourself to much higher dollar amounts.<p>You have to weigh the pros and cons and decide what's right for your situation.",1209632018

178248,comment,177859,177896,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"You're wrong. They don't need majority control of the board to veto a merger or acquisition. Most funding rounds give the investors preferred shares. An acquisition would have to be approved by the majority of preferred stock and the overall majority.<p>I'm of course not privy to Xobni's investment terms, but I'm sure it includes that. They get that sort of veto power in >99% of funding rounds.",1209631877

178245,comment,178068,178068,0,0,rantfoil,,,"I did a CE degree (Computer Systems Engineering) at Stanford. To be honest, I should have listened to my CS advisor, who said CE really doesn't give you enough depth in either CS or EE. Four years pass fast, and invariably a CE degree is the ""no theory"" or ""less theory"" degree. This will hurt you in the long run if you end up choosing CS or EE as your eventual interest. Lacking a strong algorithms / theory background, it can hurt both when interviewing (most great programming shops place a heavy emphasis on running times and algorithms) and when actually developing code. On the EE side, you pretty much need a PhD or at least a MS to get one of the more interesting R&D positions. And for applying to grad school, you'll be up to your more solidly EE brethren who have that much more coverage of the material and connection with EE faculty.<p>My suggestion: try some of both, and make a decision, and go deep.<p>If your college really is a 'java school' -- consider doing well your freshman year and transferring to a school known for solid CS instruction. It'll probably make a difference.<p>Good luck!",1209631697

178243,comment,178175,178220,0,0,gojomo,,,"<i>For the lazy, Craigslist says that they can dilute ebay's share because ebay launched Kijijijijijiji, which is a direct competitor for craigslist.</i><p>Sorta. Though Kijiji seems the motivating factor, the actual legal maneuverings are a lot more subtle, even tricky.<p>In fact, there's a curious provision apparently adopted in 2004 when EBay first got their stake. It said that the other shareholders had a right-of-first-refusal (ROFR) to acquire EBay's shares, but that if EBay started competing, that ROFR in EBay's share would expire. That's odd because the ROFR is not for EBay's benefit, but the company/others... so letting EBay unilaterally increase their freedom to sell their shares by <i>competing</i> with Craigslist seems backwards. (Instead, I would have thought the competing party would lose <i>their</i> ROFR to the others' shares.)<p>But I guess someone was thinking a few moves ahead, because it looks like Craig+Jim used the expiration of the first ROFR (in 2007 because of Kijiji) as rationalization for the creation of a new mutual ROFR. For agreeing to this new ROFR, the agreeing shareholders (Craig+Jim) would get bonus shares.... such bonus shares being just enough to dilute Ebay below a 25% ownership share, unless they also agree to the same new ROFR. 25% turns out to be a crucial threshold for electing a board member or preventing other operational changes.<p>Did Craig+Jim agree to the 2004 ROFR-expiration clause, knowing it would provide a rationale for a later new-ROFR-justified dilution? Or was the 2004 agreement just broken, and now they're trying to recover from something which gave Ebay too much freedom to both compete and sell their shares to anyone? I hope Craigslist's filing(s) clarify things.",1209631480

Admittedly, the project I use SVN for is only ~750KLOC, but I think that probably includes the vast majority of people using VCSs for source code.<p><pre><code>  Subversion, despite its marketing hype, has no support for branching and merging\n</code></pre>\nThat is overstating the case (SVN supports <i>branching</i> just fine), but I think that is SVN's only real problem is how terrible merging is (that and the whole centralized model in general, but there are plenty of circumstances in which a centralized VCS is perfectly acceptable).

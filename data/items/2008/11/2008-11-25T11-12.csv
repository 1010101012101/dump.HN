376267,comment,376238,376260,0,0,swombat,,,"That's a good point... I wouldn't consider it wise to try and outsource any <i>complicated</i> technology development to India/Pakistan/etc. However, I would consider doing so to an onshore firm that demonstrates to me that they have a clue. For instance, I know plenty of people who take on consulting work and could deal with your CSS without any problems. Depending on how much work was involved, they might even have been able to do it within $300.",1227614178
376266,comment,376238,376238,0,0,amix,,,"The thing to note about the halting problem is that it's impossible to create a general solution that works for all the input programs. That said, one could create an approximative solution and even solve the halting problem for non-turning complete languages.<p>A lot of the time when we actually solve ""hard"" problems, we only find approximative solutions (this is for example true when doing static code analysis). Asking does program X have  any non-trivial property G is impossible to do in the general case, so we find an approximative solution that can answer this in most of the cases.",1227614098

He was a successful mechanical engineer, received his PhD in philosophy based on the notebook he kept during World War I, taught philosophy, taught grammar school (though, admittedly, that didn't work out so well), and designed a house for his sister.<p>I'm not trying to belittle others, like PG, who clearly are knowledgeable (and skilled) at many things, but given the genesis of the term, I think the entry bar is pretty high.",1227613941

Despite being given a pre-cut Photoshop file, the people could not figure out simple CSS bugs or even create the CSS necessary for the tabs.  I spent more time managing them (aka <i>teaching</i>) than it would have taken me to do it, in the end I had to do half of it anyway and this entire sick ordeal took nearly two weeks.<p>My new mantra is ""Don't outsource anything the neighbors' 10 year old couldn't complete properly.""",1227613869

In my personal experience (a while back so don't know current situation) it was a bit buggy, and the offline reading thing didn't work very well.
With this you can have sort of the same (minus offline reading). 
I still prefer delicious (tag: toread or towatch) though, have to admit I'm a bit of a fan of the delicious site, so I'm not that objective.<p>Edit: How do you plan to monetize this service? Or is this more for fun?",1227612569

Look at Stonebraker's recent publishings -- more restrictive designs are always faster by several orders of magnitude for their specific domains.<p>There is absolutely a theory behind objects, I urge you to read Luca Cardelli and Martin Abadi's monograph ""A Theory of Objects"", you'll find all the answers you're looking for there with both rigorous proofs and examples from languages (real and imagined).<p>OODBs did not fail because of a lack of theory, nearly all of the people writing and using RDBs have a poor grounding in the theory -- see Fabian Pascal's contention that all of the failings of extant RDBs are because they are <i>not relational enough</i>, that <i>SQL is not relational</i>.<p>OODBs failed because the commercial Smalltalk vendors who had quality products all faded from view, and the term was hijacked by marketing departments pushing bullshit.<p>The solution I see [Google, eBay, Amazon, etc.] using is to use the DB as raw simplistic storage with strong guarantees, and to push all of the joining and caching up into an application layer.

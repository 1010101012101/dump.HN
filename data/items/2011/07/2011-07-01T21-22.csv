I've installed the seeds, I've done so without an Internet connection, and I've never had to provide any kind of license or proof of purchase.<p>Never.<p>If you want to make a claim that Apple is moving towards the Windows licensing model or even just the requirement of a license with Lion then you better be prepared to back up that claim with proof. Also please explain how I was able to install without running into the supposed ""licensing"" difficulties you seem to have run into? (e.g. the requirement of being connected to the Internet)<p>Edit: by requiring a license, I mean that the software enforces it. The ""AppStore validation"" notwithstanding, which the current seeds do not seem to use fwiw, where is the evidence? Because the seeds can be installed sans-Internet and without an Apple ID, there doesn't seem to be any evidence for this claim.<p>Edit 2: the image linked below is not of a local install: ""To <i>download</i> and restore Mac OS X, your computer's eligibility will be verified with Apple."" As previously stated, installation does not require online activation. Also I would like to point out, if you are restoring from a back up in the cloud, e.g. iCloud, you damn well better hope Apple verifies your credentials! If you're simply wanting to re-download, I don't know why you're complaining Apple is checking your credentials? At any rate, installing from the local media works without any such requirements; you do not need an Internet connection and you do not need an Apple ID. Now, can we stop with the FUD?",1309557213

2720228,comment,2716714,2718090,5,0,eneveu,,,"<i>DISCLAIMER: I'm a web developer, not a cryptographer. I've had a passing interest in cryptography for the last few months, but I've never worked in the field. I learned about it by reading Cryptography Engineering (great book) and various HN comments and blog posts. So take the following with a grain of salt... and I hope someone knowledgeable can chime in. That being said, let's roll.</i><p>> What about Debian's reason for not using bcrypt, claiming the time it takes to hash is not a weak point in security of /etc/shadow?<p>That's a good question, but I'm not sure the discussion you linked to really explains why Debian does not use bcrypt. The first post is, ironically, the most interesting one: it links to Coda Hale's great article, and to a StackExchange question where we learn that bcrypt has been OpenBSD's default password scheme since OpenBSD 2.1 (<a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.pdf</a>). OpenBSD being well-known for its code quality and security focus, this would indicate that bcrypt is actually quite adapted for OS password hashing.<p>Some critics:<p><i>First, if you don't have the salt, but you do have the hash, then a rainbow table attack is completely pointless. Reason being is rainbow tables store hashes with a 1:1 ration to text. How the table is traversed is another story, but the fact remains that one hash will lead you to one piece of text. Now add a salt. If the salt is unknown, the length of the salt is 8 characters, and the characters used in the salt are [A-Za-z0-9./], or 64 characters, then there are effectively 64^8 possible hashes for one password. That's 281474976710656 hashes. Even moving at 700,000,000 passwords per second, you have to generate that many hashes per password. Point is, you have one massive keyspace to search through. Good luck.</i><p>Here, Aaron says that salts defeat rainbow tables because they are secret, thus increasing the keyspace. While not knowing the salt does complicate password cracking, this is not the reason we use salts. Rainbow tables let crackers trade time for space: they pre-compute password hashes once, and then use this table to avoid brute-forcing each password separately. A salt defeats this because it forces the cracker to either generate a very big rainbow table, which is impractical, or to generate a different rainbow table for each salt, which is the same as brute-forcing... This has nothing to do with the salt being secret. Your only goal here is to have a random salt (a nonce, ideally).<p><i>Lastly, the SHA1 and SHA2 algorithms were designed with security in mind. Sure, they're fast, but that's the point. If you're concerned about knocking a login prompt, you shouldn't be considering the speed of the algorithm. Instead, you should be spending your time learning PAM. If you're concerned about someone brute forcing an unshadow file, bcrypt isn't going to help you if the password is low in entropy (he gives an example of a 6-character password- seriously???). If your password is high in entropy, as it should be, then even if SHA1 could churn through 400GBps, it's not going to find it. Case in point, consider <a href=""http://distributed.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distributed.net</a> hacking the 72-bit RSA key. 72-bits of entropy, and it would take them 1,100 years at their current rate to exhaust the keyspace entirely. That's only an 11-character password with [A-Za-z0-9] and [:punct:] as the possible characters. 1,100 years for an 11-character password.</i><p>Here, the argument is that there is no need to use bcrypt if the user chooses a password with a high entropy. That may be true, but then, what's the problem with making brute force attacks even slower by using bcrypt (or another slow hash function)? Low-entropy passwords would be harder to guess. High-entropy passwords would be impossible to guess.<p>The rest of the discussion focuses on the use of salts, and on how Debian stores these salts in the /etc/shadow file. At no point do they really talk about key stretching / bcrypt.<p>------------------------------------------------<p>Now, I decided to look at what Debian currently uses for password hashing. In the latest login.defs file ( <a href=""http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-shadow/debian/trunk/debian/login.defs?revision=3188&view=markup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-shadow/debian/trunk/deb...</a> ), you can see:<p><pre><code>  # If set to MD5 , MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
  # If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
  # If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
  # If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
  # Overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB option
  #
  # Note: It is recommended to use a value consistent with
  # the PAM modules configuration.
  #
  #ENCRYPT_METHOD DES
  #
  # Only used if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
  #
  # Define the number of SHA rounds.
  # With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password.
  # But note also that it more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate
  # users.
  #
  # If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).
  # The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.
  # If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
  # If MIN > MAX, the highest value will be used.
  #
  # SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
  # SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000
</code></pre>
In my Ubuntu 11.04 install, ENCRYPT_METHOD was set to SHA512 (in /etc/login.defs). SHA_CRYPT_* is not specified, so the default number of rounds is used (5000). I think this means that, by default, Ubuntu hashes password by salting them and encrypting them 5000 times with SHA512. So, Debian uses salted stretched SHA512, which does slow down brute forcing a little... But is still not ideal when compared to bcrypt.<p>I see no real reason to avoid bcrypt when hashing OS passwords. Maybe they avoid it for backward compatibility? Maybe because it is not standard enough yet? Maybe they want to comply with FIPS 140-2?<p>Other great discussions on bcrypt / password hashing:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=995634"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=995634</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1592007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1592007</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=266266"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=266266</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1091104"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1091104</a>",1309555822

If you dream in hex, clickjack for breakfast, exploit XSS, SQLi and CSRF for lunch, Buffer Overflows and Format String Vulns for Dinner and some AuthN/AuthZ hijacking for a midnight snack you're our kind of candidate.<p>You'll have time and budget to do research, go to and speak at conferences, and build tools that will change the internet (We helped develop Firesheep, if you remember that).<p>You can e-mail me directly: jbasirico at securityinnovation dot com for more informaiton.<p>Check out our postings

See my summary here of my recent travails:  <a href=""http://fexl.com/second_thoughts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com/second_thoughts</a> .<p>In short, instead of Fexl I've started using a simple token-based language.  Like Joy, my token-based language uses a stack.  But my language also uses a global mutable key-value space, and it only supports keys and values which are strings (which may be interpreted as numbers).<p>I think my little language is easier to ""execute"" manually on a white-board in a way that's easy for non-programmers to follow along.  I don't need a lot of arcane ""stack flip-aroo"" operators like Forth and Joy use.<p>So how do I do a sort you ask?  I just jam a bunch of keys into the key-value space and then use ""next"" to iterate through them.  The key-value space does the sorting for me.<p>What about strictly sequential lists you ask?  I can just store a bunch of keys using a scheme like this:<p><pre><code>  item/a1 ... item/a9
  item/b10 ... item/b99
  item/c100 ... item/c999
  item/d1000 ... item/d9999
</code></pre>
By prefixing a single character which represents the number of digits, I get the proper numerical order when I iterate in ASCII character order.<p>You know what my real goal is?  I want to be able to give my non-programmer colleagues the ability to embed little snippets of computation here and there, making simple things simple, but also imposing no upper bound on the possibilities of what they might do.",1309554853

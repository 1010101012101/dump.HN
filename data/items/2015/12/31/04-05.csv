The solid modelling has roughly the same functionality as Inventor or SolidWorks, but the user interface is far worse.  It&#x27;s so open source. There&#x27;s a pane which shows you the standard output from Python, in case something happens to print something. (This is mostly useful for people writing extensions to the program in Python, and, in typical open-source style, it&#x27;s far too prominent.)  There are panes in which dialogs appear, but they don&#x27;t fit properly; they may be higher or wider than the pane. They&#x27;re all QT-ugly, of course.  There&#x27;s no visibility in the UI of what&#x27;s important and what isn&#x27;t.  Everything has a large number of properties, most of which are irrelevant unless you&#x27;re developing.  And, of course, the program has a huge number of modal hotkeys.<p>Basically, someone slapped the UI of an integrated development environment onto a CAD program. That&#x27;s so open source.<p>This is a rather good program, too. The underlying solid modeler seems to have all the right stuff. That&#x27;s the hard part. Then they blew the UI.<p>3D content generation UIs are very hard. Some of the issues:<p>- Things may be very cluttered.  Selecting can be difficult.<p>- Some systems allow you to select volumes, faces, edges, or vertices.  In tight spots, selection needs smarts.<p>- For some operations, you need to select a subject and an object. But you may need to pan, zoom, or rotate between those two selections.  Exactly when thing get deselected is a big issue.<p>- Most GUIs are subject-verb.  (Select something, then do operation.)  That follows Macintosh and Windows practice.  This doesn&#x27;t always work out for CAD, where you may need to select multiple things, multiple kinds of things, deselect mistakes, and perhaps perform other operations while selecting.

Some Amiga users began debating how to take the platform forward. After a lot of debate, this culminated in the decision to start by creating an open-source OS based on the design of Amiga OS 3.1, which could be used as a platform for future improvements. This became the AROS project.<p>Ownership to the official Amiga assets (OS, patents and hardware) changed hands a number of times. The common pattern seemed to be a purchase by a PC manufacturer, who would then outsource the development of the platform through a dedicated subsidiary. First owners were Escom. Second owners were Gateway. Gateway was purchased by Acer at one point, so I believe the current owners are Acer. However, as mentioned previously, official development of the platform was managed by subcontractors, that went under names like &#x27;Amiga Technologies&#x27; and &#x27;Amiga Inc&#x27;.<p>Another OS split would happen because of the lack of new hardware coming from official sources. During the time when the official owners of the Amiga appeared increasingly incapable of bringing new hardware to market, a series of PowerPC accelerators appeared for classic Amigas (classic Amigas are based on the 68k family of processors). At first, these PPC accelerators would run on software designed to work alongside Amiga OS 3.x, but in time this evolved into a dedicated PPC-based OS for Amigas. This became MorphOS.<p>What about the official developments? So after Amiga OS 3.1 there were two additional releases in the 3.x series, 3.5 and 3.9. IIRC of these releases were developed by a company called H&P (Hauge & Partner, or something like that). At one point, it looked like MorphOS would become AmigaOS 4.0, however a couple of the H&P developers formed a new company called Hyperion and convinced Amiga Inc to let them develop the PPC version of Amiga OS, which became the Amiga 4.x that exists today.<p>There were various other twists to this tale that I&#x27;ve glossed over, but notable mention should go out to Amithlon (sp?), which was an unofficial AmigaOS port/emulator for x86 hardware. At one point there was some hope that this could&#x27;ve been used to pushed the Amiga forward, but it never got the official backing it needed.<p>So in terms of the remaining factions, it&#x27;s arguable that four remain:<p>1. Classic Amiga (68k-based AmigaOS, running on either real or emulated hardware).<p>2. AROS.<p>3. AmigaOS 4.x.<p>4. MorphOS.<p>In terms of software releases, there&#x27;s still a small amount of new releases, but killer apps that would be worth investing in the platform for are thin on the ground. Closest to that you&#x27;ll probably find is Hollywood, but it&#x27;s available for non-Amiga platforms now too:<p><a href=""http://www.hollywood-mal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hollywood-mal.com/</a>",1451537345

They can then take that money and use it to acquire foreign companies, run their foreign retail/support operations, invest in manufacturing capital, fund overseas R&D offices, et cetera, or just hoard a pile of cash. In the US, Apple has simultaneously taken out big loans (because they currently get ridiculously low interest rates) which money they can use for capital expenditures in the US or dividends or whatever.<p>But Apple isn’t playing any shell games about US sales, profits, or property, per se. In my opinion you should do some basic research before making such obviously false accusations.<p>There’s plenty about the Irish tax setup that is questionable, and arguably Apple should repatriate more of its foreign profits back to the US and pay US corporate taxes on them. However, the discussion should be focused on what they currently do vs. what they should be forced to do by an improved tax code, not on some imaginary scenario based on what some other companies do.",1451537279

I was lucky to emigrate as a child, and my sad, cynical reaction to whenever I see &quot;Moldova&quot; on a page out of a corner of my eye is &quot;oh boy, this is going to be a good one&quot; -- not because I wish them ill, but because the only real hope there is for individuals who can emigrate, not for the country. Fortunately, Romania is handing out citizenships to any Moldovan that cares to ask (in Romanian), and throughout the nineties and the naughts hundreds of thousands of Moldovans have been working throughout Russia, Ukraine and the EU. The remittances from emigres to their relatives left behind are a significant part of all money flows into the country.<p>I can&#x27;t see any path forward for them until they become part of either Romania or Russia, whole or in pieces. That, in turn, won&#x27;t happen,  partly for geopolitical reasons, and partly because small new nations are fucked in the head and will rather cut their own balls off than let go of any territory. Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia are excellent post-soviet examples: to continue the unfortunate metaphor, the respective sets of balls (which Russia&#x27;s got a firm grasp on through military presence and financial assistance) are the separatist Transnistria, Eastern Ukraine, Abkhasia and Ossetia. This is a clever technique, and the fact that it&#x27;s by now simultaneously well-understood and consistently successful unfortunately suggests that these countries&#x27; geopolitical limbo is partly of their own making.<p>The kind of news that pop up are:\n- Moldovan police arrest a guy looking for a buyer for 2 kg of plutonium in his car\n- Moscow road police arrest a Moldovan for naked drunk-driving\n- A sad, sad, hopeless BBC documentary about an orphanage 30km away from the capital that the foreign volunteers come to renovate and donate mattresses and toys to, only to find the toys gone and building materials stolen when they come back for a visit six months later.\n- Moldova becomes one of the desperately poor countries chosen for Michelle Obama&#x27;s program that supports the education of girls.<p>I remember being surprised when I saw Moldova declared the poorest country in Europe -- we were far from rich, but we lived in the capital and my parents shielded us well. Unfortunately, Moldova shows up at the top of that ranking year after year, except for apparently 2015, when Ukraine&#x27;s economy took a hit bad enough to earn it this dubious honor. The underlying reality is that life outside the capital is extremely hard, life in the capital is just hard, and the rules of the game are set by the elites that own whatever little wealth is to be found in Moldova.<p>More to the point regarding the OP of the thread, the capital, Chișinău, and its power and business community, is so small that in the very best scenario of a successful intervention from the outside, their long- and medium- term survival chances are zero. Any Moldovan company&#x27;s most valuable business asset is the right connections, and apparently that&#x27;s the asset that RIT Labs no longer has. If they really don&#x27;t have any funds stashed outside of Moldova, they&#x27;re completely out of their minds. In any case, they really should realize they&#x27;re de-facto already insolvent and focus on how to setup their business outside the country and ask their supporters to help them with that. It&#x27;s extremely sad, but they couldn&#x27;t have possibly not known what country they were operating in (for nearly twenty years now) and what the risks are.",1451535415

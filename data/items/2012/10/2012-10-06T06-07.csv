And when they suddenly got onto HN's front page, a whole bunch of excitement happened and they completely forgot that this was just a prototype.<p>""Pushing it to a public server"" is really minor. Mozilla had this issue, too, when they had a new filename technically available on a server and someone jumped the gun and told the whole world that the new version was ready. Well, it wasn't. A bunch of kids whined that it was all Mozilla's fault for having a file available on their public server, but while it's arguable that a service that is reachable by URL has no expectation of privacy, it's a hell of a lot harder to argue that having a service reachable by URL implies a warranty that it is safe to use.<p>Friends in the 90's would run telnet and web servers with ""Username:"" ""Password:"" ""Credit Card Number:"" prompts.

4619942,comment,4616704,4617944,2,0,mistercow,,,">Why is this an invalid approach?<p>Because of information theory. It's believed that the binary expansion of pi contains all possible finite bit sequences. A program that expands pi is relatively small. Assuming that hypothesis is true, does that mean we could write a compressor that simply breaks input into blocks and then encodes the output as indexes into pi?<p>And the answer is that we certainly could write that program. And the result would almost always be a larger output than input. Why? Because you'd have to search <i>so far</i> into pi that the index would contain more bits than the input blocks. In short, having a library of arbitrary strings to draw from does not help you to compress data.<p>More generally, compression is impossible in the general case. Every lossless compression algorithm will, on average, produce an equal or larger output than its input.",1349504127

2857564,comment,2857214,2857214,18,0,snprbob86,,,"So there are some parts of REST that make perfect sense to me. In particular, the preference for nouns w/ CRUD over verbs has many great side effects: easier caching, better logging, easier discoverability, etc. And I also get the Content-Type and Content-Language stuff, especially in terms of avoiding "".json"" or "".xml"" so that you can compare resource identity via a simple string compare.<p>But I simply do not see any value in HATEOAS outside of largely read-only datasets and generic dataset explorer type applications. Maybe it makes sense for someone like Freebase, but  it's completely useless for pretty much every other API out there.<p>You simply <i>cannot</i> build a useful API client application without deep knowledge of the problem domain and the <i>interface</i> part of API. You're going to have API documentation and you're going to have to read it.<p>Now, I understand the desire to avoid IDs and manual URL construction. That's a valuable goal. And I'll admit that I never thought of using 201 and the Location header on create; clever. But just knowing the list of relative URLs from a resource is useless. It's not like a Link rel=""newcomment"" header is going to show up and magically you'll have comment form. Besides, you need to know which 
""rel"" to lookup, so you might as well just append ""/comments"" and avoid the indirection.<p>And this all breaks down yet again when you get to offline support. If you've got a web app which is going to deal with not-yet-saved objects, you're back to being unable to compare URLs, or constructing them.<p>Lastly, while I like working with clean URLs and GET/POST over RPC calls. I dislike the ad-hoc specifications necessary to build real applications. We've got a ""RESTful"" API for our app, but we keep running into situations where different views need subtly different data. For example, decorating a resource with relationship to the current user (eg. isAdmin) or joining data when returning a list of related objects (eg. members vs memberships). The query param spaghetti is growing unwieldy, subtle authorized data leak problems are an inevitability, client-side models get confusing and easily create bugs if passed around.<p>The only solutions to these problems are excessive discipline. Discipline is something that compilers are great at providing, which is why you see things like ProtoBufs and Thift. There's no arguing over HATEOAS or RESTfulness or GET/POST or Content-Type or any of that. The message definition files act as a baseline API documentation, which are enforced programmatically. The designers of these tools had things to do and didn't have time to deal with this nonsense.<p>Stop the pontificating and get back to work.",1312746780

2857544,comment,2856702,2856702,73,0,katovatzschyn,,,"<i>From Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine: </i><p>In February 1993, Canada was in the midst of financial catastrophe, or so one would have concluded by reading the newspapers and watching TV. Debt Crisis Looms, screamed a banner front-page headline in the national newspaper, the Globe and Mail. A major national television special reported that economists are predicting that sometime in the next year, maybe two years, the deputy minister of finance is going to walk into cabinet and announce that Canadas credit has run out. Our lives will change dramatically.<p>The phrase debt wall suddenly entered the vocabulary. What it meant was that, although life seemed comfortable and peaceful now, Canada was spending so far beyond its means that, very soon, powerful Wall Street firms like Moodys and Standard and Poors would downgrade our national credit rating from its perfect Triple A status to something much lower. When that happened, hypermobile investors, liberated by the new rules of globalisation and free trade, would simply pull their money from Canada and take it somewhere safer. The only solution, we were told, was to radically cut spending on such programs as unemployment insurance and health care. Sure enough, the governing Liberal Party did just that, despite having just been elected on a platform of job creation.<p>Two years after the deficit hysteria peaked, the investigative journalist Linda McQuaig definitively exposed that a sense of crisis had been carefully stoked and manipulated by a handful of think tanks funded by the largest banks and corporations in Canada, particularly the C. D. Howe Institute and the Fraser Institute (which Milton Friedman had always actively and strongly supported). Canada did have a deficit problem, but it wasnt caused by spending on unemployment insurance and other social programs. According to Statistics Canada, it was caused by high interest rates, which exploded the worth of the debt much as the Volcker Shock had ballooned the developing worlds debt in the eighties. McQuaig went to Moodys Wall Street head office and spoke with Vincent Truglia, the senior analyst in charge of issuing Canadas credit rating. He told her something remarkable: that he had come under constant pressure from Canadian corporate executives and bankers to issue damning reports about the countrys finances, something he refused to do because he considered Canada an excellent, stable investment. Its the only country that I handle where, usually, nationals from that country want the country downgraded even more  on a regular basis. They think its rated too highly. He said he was used to getting calls from country representatives telling him he had issued too low a rating. But Canadians usually, if anything, disparage their country far more than foreigners do.<p>Thats because, for the Canadian financial community, the deficit crisis was a critical weapon in a pitched political battle. At the time Truglia was getting those strange calls, a major campaign was afoot to push the government to lower taxes by cutting spending on social programs such as health and education. Since these programs are supported by an overwhelming majority of Canadians, the only way the cuts could be justified was if the alternative was national economic collapse  a full blown crisis. The fact that Moodys kept giving Canada the highest possible bond rating  the equivalent of an A++  was making it extremely difficult to maintain the apocalyptic mood.<p>Investors, meanwhile, were getting confused by the mixed messages. Moodys was upbeat about Canada, but the Canadian press constantly presented the national finances as catastrophic. Truglia got so fed up with the politicised statistics coming out of Canada, which he felt were calling his own research into question, that he took the extraordinary step of issuing a special commentary clarifying that Canadas spending was not out of control, and he even aimed some veiled shots at the dodgy math practiced by right-wing think tanks. Several recently published reports have grossly exaggerated Canadas fiscal debt position. Some of them have double counted numbers, while others have made inappropriate international comparisons These inaccurate measurements may have played a role in exaggerated evaluations of the severity of Canadas debt problems. With Moodys special report, word was out that there was no looming debt wall  and Canadas business community was not pleased. Truglia says that when he put out the commentary, one Canadian from a very large financial institution in Canada called me up on the telephone screaming at me, literally screaming at me. That was unique.<p>By the time Canadians learned that the deficit crisis had been grossly manipulated by the corporate-funded think tanks, it hardly mattered  the budget cuts had already been made and locked in. As a direct result, social programs for the countrys unemployed were radically eroded and have never recovered, despite many subsequent surplus budgets. The crisis strategy was used again and again in this period. In September 1995, a video was leaked to the Canadian press of John Snobelen, Ontarios minister of education, telling a closed-door meeting of civil servants that before cuts to education and other unpopular reforms could be announced, a climate of panic needed to be created by leaking information that painted a more dire picture than he would be inclined to talk about. He called it creating a useful crisis.""<p><a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/106249/US-Credit-Rating-Downgrade-Expected-This-Weekend#3855391"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/106249/US-Credit-Rating-Downgrade-...</a>",1312746420

Much of the hard-core low-level stuff was learned either on your own, or when you got into an environment where it was necessary to know.<p>There are some additional skills that are falling by the wayside as well.  One is how to optimize instructions on a type 650 rotating drum computer.  Or more realistically, how to program co-routines in an interrupt-driven environment. Or how to write a floating-point division routine if you are working on a 286 target that does not have a 287. Or what order to write items to a disk and where to place them to minimize arm movement in a real-time data-driven system.<p>I admit that some of these are actually less necessary now due to technology being replaced, or machines being ridiculously faster.<p>But I was around when those technologies were necessary and useful (well, not the 650, but almost).  We built a real-time system in assembler that had to be seriously well-optomized, and we had to modify the operating system to remove hazardous a latency that was fogging our 2ms data sampling rate.<p>But you know, simultaneously with that were COBOL programmers who had to be schooled in the idea that writing backups to tape was a good idea.<p>So there always has been a gap--this article suggests that this is something new.<p>Having said all that, this is an excellent article, as it is a challenge to programmers who would be better, and has a forest of valuable links to learn more.

2857535,comment,2856702,2857286,6,0,pessimizer,,,"It is a political statement. As the Gr.Grandfather comment said, our debts are denominated in dollars, and can be paid off instantly, simply by printing the money. The only reason we can't is because the interest rates on treasuries would go asymptotic if we did that, because investing in bonds denominated in a currency that has a history of doing that would be a risky thing to say the least.<p>If the reason for the S&P downgrade was based on the debt, it would be purely political, because along with US treasuries, every security denominated in dollars would have to be equally downgraded simultaneously to make economic sense. They understand this, so this is not the reason they gave - they graded the US on its <i>willingness</i> to pay its debts. I think that's a vast overestimation of the power of unpopular spoiler Republicans (edit: and anti-Chinese xenophobia), but a case can be made.<p>But, even with the fiscal shape of the US now, investors are buying treasuries with interest rates at historic lows, because if you're not investing in US treasuries, what are you going to invest in? The property bubble was largely a response to super low treasury rates, and since it has burst, there has been a massive run-up in precious metals as a way to store savings and get a rate that beats inflation. Investors (the only people that have to be answered to in questions of government debt) make their evaluation of US debt available in real time, and the evaluation is excellent, no matter what any individual investors/pundits say with their mouths.<p>The worst outcome of more money printing is that those interest rates start to rise, making the dollar less valuable with respect to other currencies, which will make imported products more expensive for domestic consumers, and make our exports cheaper abroad, stimulating a rise in domestic manufacturing and employment. If in addition, that newly printed money was used to make investments in infrastructure, or simply handed to people with low to negative savings who will immediately spend it, the domestic inflationary effect would be captured by a rise in domestic wages. To the degree that all of this happens is the degree to which the massive trade deficits we've been running since Reagan decline or reverse, and the national debt (the combination of domestic public and private debt) is an accumulation of those deficits.<p>(And I would point out that I can't emphasize <i>this</i> point enough: If we do nothing to Social Security, it will be able to pay exactly as it has until 2035, and if no fixes have been made until then, 80% of what it has been paying until the earth plunges into the sun. This 80% will go further than the 100% being paid now due to the productivity gains between now and then, unless our response to the underutilized economy of this demand crisis is to make cuts that further underutilize the economy.)<p>----<p>edit: that's what I get for not RTFA before commenting. I gave S&P a benefit of the doubt that it didn't deserve, and most of this was actually said by the treasury except for the ""weak dollar is good and SS is fine"" stuff. Well, a weakened dollar is good and SS is fine:)",1312746299

Do not fix it and you will continue to enjoy a front seat to the spectacle that is the destruction of the US from the inside.<p>Whether you lean liberal or conservative, the truth is that if we don't change you can kiss all you hold dear goodbye because we are only headed in one direction...an it ain't up.  Your politicians are too busy trying to get re-elected to actually do what they are supposed to be doing.<p>If you started over, blank slate, how would you structure government and taxation so that they would produce the right results for the country?<p>Some key questions apply here:<p>1- What is the role of government?
2- How much of our lives should government control?
3- What is the purpose of taxation?
4- Should this be a country where the government protects people and companies from failure?
5- If charities and religious organizations operate tax free, shouldn't they be tasked with helping those in need rather than doing it through government programs?
6- The world is complicated.  Shouldn't those who aspire to hold office (at various levels) demonstrate competency in the required fields of study much like anyone else applying for a job?
7- How can we stop voting because we like someone, or they speak well, or they look good on TV?  All of which are far from qualifying anyone to hold office.<p>Of course, there are dozens of questions one could ask on this subject.",1312746259

2857447,comment,2852380,2853873,1,0,jad,,,"> As above, the problem is corruption. We have a structure that is supposed to effectively keep the federal government almost completely incapable of doing anything besides maintaining international borders, treaties, and other boring matters like import taxes.<p>This isn't true at all. There was a group of founders led intellectually by Alexander Hamilton who believed in a strong central government and who saw the federal Constitution as giving that government very broad powers.<p>This is in opposition to the Jeffersonian view of limited government, the primacy of the states, the ideal of the yeoman farmer, etc.<p>>  Because the people in power like power, and because the populace is complacent enough to allow it, they ignore any structural inconveniences like the fact that a strict reading of the Constitution forbids almost all federal programs and activities that exist today.<p>This also isn't true. Setting aside whether the Constitution forbids, say, the Department of Education or whatever, we have the government we have because that's what people have voted for. FDR was elected president 4 times. The New Deal was popular at the time. He wasn't cramming it down the throats of a credulous population.<p>It's a good thing that the Constitution is malleable enough to continue to support the wishes of a majority of Americans. If it isn't, we can either amended it so that it does (which we have done when needed), or, in an extreme case, replace it completely.<p>The Constitution exists to serve the people, not the other way around.",1312744204

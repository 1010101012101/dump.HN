I&#x27;ve been using MATLAB since before it had a JIT.  In fact, for the Julia code I didn&#x27;t even devectorize which would play to its relative strengths. I also didn&#x27;t have to pull out a profiler for all of this, it just happened with the first stab at it.<p>>Since right now I&#x27;m finishing up stuff it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to re-write all my Matlab processing routines into Julia.<p>No need to, just do what I did and pick one function that&#x27;s called in a tight loop and try testing that.  If you don&#x27;t find the performance that you&#x27;d like, post a code example on the julia-users mailing list (under the Community link on the website).  Folks will either help you to 1) improve your code with Julia&#x27;s design in mind, or 2) use your code as a test case to improve Julia itself.  The community is very helpful.<p>A peek at the performance tips section in the manual is a good idea.  Don&#x27;t forget to wrap your code in a function for testing, and to &quot;warm up&quot; your code (= give the JIT a chance) before calling the @time macro on your function.  Good luck!",1391525839

A weapon in orbit has to wait until it&#x27;s over the target before it can attack, which could be a long wait. It also has all of the problems of putting anything in orbit, maintenance, station keeping, longevity, etc. In contrast, a weapon designed to fly through space on a ballistic trajectory can be much simpler and cheaper. Moreover, because they start on the Earth ICBMs can always hit their targets within a single sub-orbital hop, they don&#x27;t have to wait for attack windows to line up.",1391525799

Even with the barcodes, many airports and lounges do not actually check the barcodes, they just visually verify the info.<p>There was a story a few years back when Delta and some others started doing boarding by zones.

Even when you are in a place that DOES use the barcode reader to pull the data, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to hack the barcode.  The reader devices appear to be non-networked, so they are just scanning a code and displaying text.

Well, they haven&#x27;t stuck to any particular plan for long enough to come up with a version three of anything in 15 years.<p>Hell, Microsoft pioneered tablet computers, but after some promising early models and some decent push into the innovation required, they kind of just let that project wither on the vine until Apple came up with a workable model.

I don&#x27;t know enough of the details to understand the link you&#x27;re making.<p>> The existence of market failure is no position. Just for the fact that there is market failure does not have any implication on what to do about it.<p>The first sentence is incorrect, and is not implied by the second sentence, which is correct. The &#x27;position&#x27; is that, in order to have an efficient market, one should not do things that cause market failure. It is a negative position rather than a positive one (DON&#x27;T do X rather than DO X), but it is still a position. It informs you about what sort of things you shouldn&#x27;t do if you want a market to operate efficiently.<p>> That is simply something that is often assert because it makes for good propaganda<p>Saying that collusion can lead to market failure, and thus must be proscribed if one wishes to have an efficient market, is not propaganda. It is the kind of thing that must be said, seemingly repeatedly, to illustrate the point that markets are <i>not</i> a magical solution to the allocation problem.<p>The argument you subsequently make, that &quot;we don&#x27;t know better&quot;, is both completely standard and completely wrong. We may well not know better than an efficient market - I&#x27;m not sure but it seems very reasonable. However, moving from that to suggest that imposing controls such as anti-collusion regulations (along with a whole host of other measures to avoid market failure), is unnecessary, is unsubstantiated.<p>If you examine your own argument, it is based by your own admission on an assertion. The foundation for why one might think that what you are saying is true (market theory) <i>explicitly</i> lays out the assumptions required for it to work, and you ignore these on a purely ideological basis.",1391524729

The only reason that program came to even the bastardized fruition it did was because the Air Force signed on, and they did so only because they needed a means of servicing and maintaining their orbital equipment. In theory, and occasionally in practice, this means involved actual human astronauts going up and doing spanner work on satellites in orbit, but this was expensive and fraught with undue difficulty; cheaper and easier was simply to stuff the whole satellite into the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay and haul it back down the gravity well for repair, refit, and relaunch, and indeed many Space Shuttle missions involved precisely this evolution. (It&#x27;s probable, if uncertain due to the Air Force&#x27;s bent for secrecy with regard to their payloads, that the Shuttle was used to return some or most of these satellites to orbit; on the other hand, a Titan-IV&#x27;s probably cheaper, and the Air Force has used plenty of those, too. I don&#x27;t know much about what goes into that sort of decision.)<p>The X-37, then, far from being some kind of conspiracy-theory FOBS, is just a Space-Shuttle-style &quot;space truck&quot;. The major difference is that technology has now reached a point where it&#x27;s possible for such a vehicle to satisfy the Air Force&#x27;s mission parameters without having to involve all the complex, costly, and potentially disastrous encumbrances required to carry living humans into space.<p><i>Edit!</i> I&#x27;ve finally just recalled the name of the book from which I gained my understanding of the politicking which took the Space Shuttle program from initial conception to final operational &quot;Space Transportation System&quot;.

So if you have a traditional triangular capsule, yes, you do in fact need a honkin&#x27; big engine (and more importantly, a big fuel tank...) to expand your &quot;landing zone&quot;.  But if you have wings, even if the L/D ratio is not exactly a high performance glider, you still have an immensely larger &quot;landing zone&quot; so you don&#x27;t need a honkin&#x27; big engine.  Thats why they invest mass and volume in those wings instead of engines, tanks, and a parachute.<p>Another way to phrase it, is without wings you pretty much land somewhere along the ground track you would have passed over plus or minus like ten miles.  But with wings, you can get hundreds, maybe thousands of miles of cross range glide.  Your orbit can be over Chicago but you can decide to land in Florida.<p>We&#x27;ve had the strategic nuclear triad for decades, this thing&#x27;s certainly big enough to make a strategic quadrilateral or maybe one leg of the triad is getting too expensive and needs retirement.<p>If you have patience, perhaps for a doomsday weapon or strategic deterrent, you don&#x27;t need wings, giant engines, or much of a parachute.  Its obviously a sensor platform not a weapon.<p>So what kind of sensor platform exists where its cheaper to launch 1000 one terabyte hard drives in a NAS than to downlink all that stuff.  Well, &quot;strategic&quot; photographic imaging, maybe some kind of wide bandwidth SDR...  The kind of thing were you press the record button and a year later gather demographic strategic intel, rather than a handful of snapshots of one semi-tactical target.  Like how many total radar units does Iran have, well, you listen to the entire surveillance radar band over the country for an entire year, then do a lot of analysis once it lands.

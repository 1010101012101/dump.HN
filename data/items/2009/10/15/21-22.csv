You could be the one who ends up in hot water depending on how you ""mess"" with this guy. Besides, do you really want to try to scam a guy who might be making his living as a criminal? You basically know nothing about him. He could be your run of the mill dirt bag or someone capable of completely fucking you or sneaking into your house to slit your throat. Just tell him you're not comfortable with the arrangement, report him to the police or FBI and move on.",1255643904

I think that 3 things made Apple the kind of the smart phone market:<p>1) Great product ahead of any other existing product at the time (not anymore though).<p>2) Understand that the mobile market value chain was vastly different than the PC one and architected a platform that would be attracting existing market players while creating a exclusive new market for themselves (this was so bold and smart).<p>3) Steve Jobs genius.<p>Now, the only thing that scares me is that they did it in the most proprietary way that any software companies have ever dare doing. Apple is the living proof that openness is not a required ingredient to create new technology based markets.<p>So, again, kudos to Apple to revolutionize a market that have been frozen for years. However, they are doing it in such as way that it could set a very bad precedence to the software industry.<p>I do not want to have to go through a iMicrosoftStore to publish my Windows application, a iGoogleStore to publish a Web Site, a iAndroidStore to publish a mobile application.<p>I have nothing against software stores, but they should be  optional not required.",1255643546

I remember buying cotton swabs in France that were amazing quality (there were none with bare ends, they were rigid enough to actually <i>swab</i> and they came in a convenient container), however ones I bought from Walmart for the same price (converted, not face value) were god awful in quality (easily 5% were bare ended, they were made of the cheapest thinnest plastic tubes that were less rigid than a bendy straw and couldn't swab at all and came in a cheap plastic bag).<p>I suppose these aren't the things usually purchased online though.<p>Having actually worked as a video game/movie reviewer, I've rarely bought or seen a movie that I knew I wouldn't like. I'm even cunning enough to get out of having to go see chick flicks with my wife (most of the time, but that doesn't spare me from rentals and TV runs).

Most dog foods will get five stars because they just do their job. And only a few donâ€™t, hence the skewed distribution. But the customer has no problem at all to avoid bad products. If anything such a clear dichotomy should make it rather easy.<p>(Just one little theory of mine: I think star reviews donâ€™t work anymore when it comes to more complex [say, than dog food] things. For those you need to read the written reviews and ignore stars. [And maybe look at the distribution. Finding out that a product is polarising and the reasons for that can be helpful.] If someone rates a camera with one star because it doesnâ€™t film 1080p [a perfectly valid complaint] I donâ€™t care much for his opinion because of different preferences. His written information is nevertheless helpful [I could, after all, care for 1080p], but the information conveyed in his one star rating is close to zero.)",1255641095

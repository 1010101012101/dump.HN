I think massive distributed systems processing huge amounts of data using exotic network technologies and super tight code are interesting, but it's not everyone's bag.<p>C++ is still used a lot because it's fast and allows you to efficiently communicate with the hardware and OS.  I'll admit it's ugly, but it's a good choice for certain systems.  On the pure analytics side, most quants seem to be moving to more modern and flexible languages, where prototyping ideas quickly is more important than latency.<p>Jane St Capital uses OCaml extensively (<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2336889538700185341#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2336889538700185341...</a>).<p>I'm curious to see if Google's Go makes any inroads.

Also, North Korea uses the Korea Exchange: \n<a href=""http://www.mapsofworld.com/north-korea/economy/stock-exchange.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mapsofworld.com/north-korea/economy/stock-exchang...</a><p>My point is that North Koreans, like anyone else in the world, communist or capitalist, have very little of their value in the form of paper currency. Whether it be goats, rice, gold, stock, bank accounts, etc.. They may value themselves based on a nationally recognized currency (the won?), but that doesn't mean that most of their value is in the form of liquid cash.<p>The theory of currency recognizes the value of a currency based on its level of trust (to be paid back). Soo in a country like North Korea (ESPECIALLY), citizens probably rarely maintain their worth in the form of paper currency. Because they don't trust it (whether they consciously realize it or not). If Americans don't trust the US dollar, you can imagine that North Koreans don't trust their own currency. Educated or not, brain washed or not, that's common sense.<p>Another example. I personally trust the American dollar very much. But how much do I have in the form of liquid cash? About $50 in my wallet. The rest of my worth is in assets, stock, savings, 401k, car, tv, intellect, etc. Just not liquid cash. So if America changed currencies all of the sudden, I'd say, ""Rats, I just lost $50.""<p>Sooo, again, my point is that this probably doesn't change much for North Koreans. Especially since most of them probably have very little personal wealth anyway (paper cash or other forms of value).<p>Heavens.",1259891168

I hope currying does not confuse you.) I agree that in a lot of scenarios you can be happy with a step function<p><pre><code>  step :: State -> Input -> (Output, State)\n</code></pre>\nand a loop that feeds inputs to the step function, then does something with the output (like displaying it) and repeats with the new state.  Here I could argue that this loop is best described as a tail-recursive function; but I guess the loop is bearable.  However what if you have more complex flow of control?  Like a non-deterministic state machine.  Think of a parser.  There loops won't suffice and you will have to make up your own control structures out of function calls.  (Or emulate them with an explicit stack.  But why re-implement language features?)  Composability also benefits from tail calls.<p>I do not know if the above paragraph contains an argument that's good enough.  What do you think?  I do know that parsing with combinators is pleasant to program and benefits (at least in its natural expression in FP) from proper tail calls.<p>I also toy with the idea of using the following definitions instead of separating the (deterministic) stepping function from the state in the interface:<p><pre><code>  date StepState = State (Input -> (Output, StepState))\n</code></pre>\n(It might be a good idea to then separate state and stepping function in most implementations.  In Haskell I'd also --- probably --- use typeclasses.  But that doesn't add to the point here.)",1259890106

Eventually, both sides agreed to a Settlement. <i>By settling their claims, both sides avoid the uncertainty and cost of a trial or appeal.</i><p>This is common when big companies get sued - usually it's cheaper to pay off the other side what's colloquially called ""nuisance money"" than to fight.<p>> <i>The original deposit of $9,500,000, plus accrued interest, will constitute the “Settlement Fund.”</i> The Settlement Fund will be used: (i) to set up a non-profit Privacy Foundation, described below; (ii) to pay certain costs of administering the Settlement, as approved by the Court; and <i>(iii) to pay attorneys’ fees and expenses to Class Counsel in the amount awarded by the Court as well as any compensation to the Representative Plaintiffs which the parties have proposed to be in an amount totaling $41,500 distributed among 19 individuals.</i><p>The settlement is $9.5 million. Of that, $41,500 goes to Facebook users, 19 of them specifically, and you don't get anything.<p>> If you choose to do nothing, and remain in the settlement class you will be legally bound by the settlement. By doing nothing, you will be giving up the right to sue Facebook and the other Defendants over claims related to or arising out of the Beacon program.<p>Lawyers do this all the time. They'll sue a phone company like AT&T for $500 million saying that the phone company didn't adequately notify people that an ""unlimited"" text messaging plan only included 5,000 text messages or something. AT&T will settle by giving every user 5 free text messages and pay the law firms $20 million in nuisance money.<p>The users effectively get nothing, the lawyers destroy value over nothing of real significance and get paid for it. On the off chance they're fought and lose, the law firms are almost never held personally liable for the company's legal fees.

You completely misinterpreted my post (or just used it as a soapbox to insert your views into the discussion). The post I was replying too said nothing about Google pulling all the information on you together. The poster seemed to be irked that your DNS provider also had access to the content of the pages you were using DNS lookups to view.

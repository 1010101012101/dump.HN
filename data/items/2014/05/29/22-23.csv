The answer was to fix the perceived problems in OpenSSL and make it as solid as it can be. It&#x27;s splitting talent and resources unnecessarily.<p>But that is what the fork is, OpenSSL with new stewards. What is your objection? That they are using a different name? That they decided to remove certain platforms which were a maintenance burden? That FIPS is broken by design and therefore isn&#x27;t a priority? I imagine the OpenSSL team disagrees with the LibreSSL team on all of these issues. The only option was a fork.<p>> Right now, native libressl only works on bsd&#x27;s, when openssl codebase works on many os&#x27;s.

What I meant in my previous comment was that adding more machines for scaling is not only more expensive, but can add significant latencies if those machines are using a distributed cache (as each would invalidate the other&#x27;s caches, creating more misses). It&#x27;s always preferable to utilize fewer machines better.<p>I would say that the risk Quasar brings is no different from any 1 year old library. It&#x27;s young, so test it well and introduce it carefully gradually to production. The bytecode manipulation Quasar performs is vastly simpler than, say, JRebel. Quasar does not change object layouts or any such thing. It simply injects code into suspendable methods to copy local variables into an array and back.",1401403985

For this, you first start with a known set of documents (known means their type, whether business, science, sports, etc is known), and index them. For each word/phrase, you compute the proability that it belongs to a certain category. For example, when you see Shingles, you say 50% is disease, 40% is roofs and 10% is code.

I convinced myself I didn&#x27;t have time anymore to be technical.  After I started writing, I realized I had to immerse myself in the tech I wrote about before composing my articles.  Now, I learn a new technology (or a deeper aspect of one I know) every week.  Strangely, I find more time to write code, build applications and test features than I ever had.  This got me a new role, no longer managing but as an application admin, doing technical work every day.  Bottom line, writing about tech got me thinking differently, reminded me what I love about technology and why I thrive in technical environments.  Staying creative touches on many levels, so I&#x27;d say learn, learn, learn - read and find out what is going on in the world you love, and after you&#x27;ve learned something new, tell someone about it.",1401403620

7818995,comment,7818604,7818604,5,0,vitovito,,,"Hi!  Designer and researcher, here.  When Steve Blank/Eric Ries say you should &quot;validate&quot; your idea, this is not what they mean.  This is not validating an idea.  This is having a solution and looking for a problem.<p>To actually validate this idea, you need a few things.<p>First, you need to get rid of the &quot;I would like&quot; that starts your second paragraph.  If you are creating a product or service for other people to use, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you would &quot;like.&quot;  All that matters is what they would pay for (or actively use, if you have no business model).  That could be something you don&#x27;t want to work on at all, but an idea you don&#x27;t care for but others will pay for will always out earn an idea only you love.<p>Second, you need to get rid of the rest of the second paragraph.  That&#x27;s your pre-defined solution, in search of a problem.  Sorry!<p>(Note: if all you want to do is build something for fun, then you don&#x27;t need to validate anything at all!  Building it for fun should be enough.  Just don&#x27;t expect anything more out of it, and if you decide to productize it, expect to start over from scratch.)<p>Your actual idea is &quot;TripAdvisor&#x27;s &#x27;Saved Trips&#x27; is inconvenient, and doesn&#x27;t help me plan the best possible trips around my vacation schedule.&quot;<p>Third, asking strangers here, in this way, isn&#x27;t helpful.  It&#x27;s not providing true validation.  This isn&#x27;t any better than asking friends and family what they think of your idea.  None of the data you get out of this (or asking your friends/family) is valid.  It can&#x27;t be used to support your business case.<p>So, fourth, to actually validate your idea, you need to find a few different types of people:<p>- people who have a fixed number of PTO days and who have recently (last six months) taken a trip.  you&#x27;ll want to specify the kind of trips you want to optimize for.  day trips within driving distance?  multi-day trips?  national/international?  people think about different kinds of trips differently.  you&#x27;ll want to understand how they made the choice to make that trip, what were their considerations, what was difficult in it.<p>- people who have a fixed number of PTO days and wanted to travel, but didn&#x27;t.  you&#x27;ll want to understand why they didn&#x27;t take the trip.<p>- people who use TripAdvisor&#x27;s Saved Trips section.  you&#x27;ll want to understand why they use it.  maybe it&#x27;s inconvenient for your use case because it&#x27;s meant for people who plan trips differently than you.<p>With this information, you&#x27;ll be able to understand the pain points for your imagined user, and that will let you come up with possible solutions.  The one you&#x27;ve posited above might be in there, but, crucially, <i>it also might not be.</i><p>Once you&#x27;ve addressed the pain points and come up with a potential solution, then you go back to the users in the first two groups and see if they&#x27;d pay for it.<p>That&#x27;s the only true validation: will they cut you a check?  That&#x27;s the core part of MVP that people forget about: it&#x27;s the minimum product that <i>someone will pay for.</i><p>If they would, that&#x27;s validation for your idea.  If they wouldn&#x27;t, you need to figure out if your solution is wrong, or if there&#x27;s not a market there.<p>Good luck!",1401402196

So getting an extra ~10X connections to work with makes a big difference.<p>I guess my next thought would be, how broadly applicable are those service characteristics?

In fact, we have several which are in quite wide use today. See: dm-crypt, loop-aes, luks, tcplay, encfs, ecryptfs, etc (okay, some of these aren&#x27;t FDE tools in and of themselves, but parts of a system which can be used for FDE). Anyone who uses FDE on Linux is surely using one or two of these.<p>It&#x27;s really just a matter of someone being motivated enough to develop one for Windows. The entire reason for TrueCrypt&#x27;s popularity over Bitlocker was that it was open source software. All this means is that one developer got sick and tired of it, which is completely understandable, but it can absolutely not be extrapolated to say that all have.<p>DiskCryptor is currently looking like the next big viable alternative for an open source Windows FDE tool. I&#x27;m hoping we see some EFI support though, so I can finally get off BIOS mode.<p>In my opinion, the best method is to gather a few skilled Windows driver developers to craft a driver based around existing technology, like FreeOTFE, which supports dm-crypt images.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens, I certainly think the demand and interest is high enough that we can get some good people on the case.

The only new feature is &quot;Gates,&quot; which the documentation admits are awkward and need to be revisited â€” and many Promise libraries already provide simple mechanisms for sharing resources similar to what Gates allow, but with more-consistent APIs. Zones also don&#x27;t work several important Node-core libraries (cluster, fs, zlib, and more), whereas Promise libraries solved interop long ago.<p>Promises/A+ is already standardized and is shipping in browsers. Yes, Promises/A+ is more complicated than it needs to be, and I wish a simpler, more monadic approach had won out. But this is an unnecessary flow-control fork, and it&#x27;s not even a particularly good one by comparison. If Zones were built on top of the ES6 standard, all ES6-compatible promise libraries would immediately work with it (and there are many mature ones that already exist). No existing libraries work with Zones, and the existing ones will need to be amended to add Zone-specific interop.<p>God knows nobody needs a zone-to-promise converter; there are enough ways to do asynchronous flow control as it stands. This blog post seems to hope that Zones will some day make it into Node core; I sincerely hope they don&#x27;t in their current state.",1401401876

7818902,comment,7817586,7818468,1,0,esbranson,,,"The difference between lawfully entering a 7-11 and trespass is just as you describe the situation with a server. Authorization can be implied, and &quot;unauthorization&quot; can be trivial.<p>The real problem is that a lock on a door is more obvious than a URL scheme. The government is saying that entering a 7-11 that is unlocked, but walking in backwards, is criminal trespass because that&#x27;s not what the 7-11 intended for the customer to do. That&#x27;s nonsense. Implicit authorization in physical property is just so much more straightforward, and the government is trying to maliciously take advantage of the lack of common sense on what is unauthorized, helped along by a Congress that willfully authorizes such action.<p>And I like your server dealer analogy. The question is whether or not a computer is an agent of its owner and whether its decisions, right or wrong, can be relied upon in business dealings as the actions of its owner.<p>So what is the digital equivalent of a lock on a door? Must the law explicitly say a lock on a door signifies lack of authorization to enter? Is walking into a 7-11 store backwards implicitly unauthorized?",1401401159

There is a subset of American pedestrians who, because the law says they have the right of way, believe that the laws of physics also do not apply to them either.  I have personally witnessed, too many times to count, a pedestrian approaching a crosswalk across a busy, four lane road, who continues, fast paced, without slowing the slightest, towards, into, and across, the crosswalk, without so much as even a glance left or right to check where the oncoming traffic happens to be.  I.e., they just step out in front of cars (4 lanes worth) moving 35MPH, with no regard for how much distance there is between a cars hood and their spot in the crosswalk.<p>The only thing that saves them from getting killed is the random positioning of cars such that they don&#x27;t actually step in front of a car with only 20 feet left before impact, and the fact that the drivers with 100 feet of space left nearly skid to a stop because of the fool that forget what his/her mother taught them: &quot;Always look both ways before crossing the street&quot;.<p>Sadly, this total lack of common sense seems to infest about 20% of the pedestrian population, and is a major factor contributing to the accident rate.  Because quite simply, if you are not in front of a moving car, you can&#x27;t possibly be hit.",1388079702

Ideally all code should be available on github.<p>Then people can examine your assumptions (including ones you knew you were making and ones you didn&#x27;t) and modelling, as well as fork or pull request to do benchmarks in some other way to better model the scenarios they care about.<p>Although also in my experience, you get LOTS of people telling you your benchmark is wrong because of X, Y or Z -- sometimes they are correct that it doesn&#x27;t accurately capture something they are interested in, sometimes they are just confused -- but virtually nobody actually interested in writing code via fork or pull request to capture what they are interested in. Once you put out a benchmark, everyone in the peanut gallery thinks they are entitled to keep demanding you change it in various ways for them.)<p>No matter how much time you spend on it and thought you put into it, publishing a benchmark on HN is probably the easiest way to have lots of people telling you you&#x27;re an idiot who did things wrong. It almost seems like HN collectively wants to discourage people from running benchmarks -- or from sharing what they found publicly.<p>But it&#x27;s because doing good benchmarking is so hard -- well, that&#x27;s exactly we need more people working on it, and sharing how they did it so others can improve upon it, etc, right?",1388079105

And so when speaking abstractly (as these videos are), they are often <i>less wrong</i> than anyone else (Clapper, this is how you use that term...).

Citation of such is nearly a moot point, as no generalizable experiments yet exist.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;d be a great resource if they listed to the side a paper or review about some of the stuff they just spoke of.

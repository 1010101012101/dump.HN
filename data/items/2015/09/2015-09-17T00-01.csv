I think this would come under the &quot;reasonable reliance on legal representations of those responsible for enforcing the law&quot;. Is the fact that a (later-to-be-declared-unconstitutional) law allows something itself a defense? I would strongly expect that to be the case, so to the extent that NSA programs were authorized by the Patriot act, even if said act is unconstitutional, workers would be immune.<p>In any event, following a later-declared-unconstitutional law does not seem to qualify as &quot;deliberately contrary to Constitutional&quot;.<p>>Sure, the Constitution itself doesn&#x27;t provide criminal penalties, but there (as noted above) are statutory provisions creating criminal liability for government officers that use their position to deny people Constitutionally-protected rights.<p>Fair enough.<p>>Government actions by actors other than Congress, and not justified by appeals to statute, can be decided on Constitutional grounds, both negative (Constitutional limitations) and positive (questions of whether positive authority is granted.)<p>If an action isn&#x27;t warranted by statute, why would a court consider Constitutional issues at all?

SMP was a grudging afterthought; the original concept was that each VM &quot;node&quot; was a single scheduler process bound to a single core, and then you tied those nodes together into a (machine-internal) multi-core distributed system, effectively creating a set of &quot;threads&quot; communicating over socket-based message-passing IPC, rather than shared memory.<p>M:N scheduling—where, critically, a task can be re-scheduled from one core to another—is a much more complex and less-predictable design, that&#x27;s not always worth the trouble. For Erlang&#x27;s particular use-cases, it turned out to be worth the trouble <i>enough</i> to justify programming it, eventually. But the SMP VM is still only built via a configure flag, rather than displacing the M:1 VM as &quot;the&quot; VM.",1442451288

10230942,comment,10229802,10230882,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"There are a few separate problems at play.  Security is never one thing.<p>The root of the password problem is that people don&#x27;t use a password database.  I didn&#x27;t until recently, even though I was aware of the risks.  It was more than I could be bothered to do.  Apparently Rayiner wasn&#x27;t using one until recently as well.  It seems pretty likely that most people won&#x27;t use one unless they&#x27;re forced to.<p>The effect of this is that if you use the same password on many services, you&#x27;re at a pretty big risk.  What do most users do, then?  &quot;Ah, I&#x27;m clever; I&#x27;ll put the name of the service in the password.&quot;<p>Trouble is, this is exactly the same as the previous situation.  You&#x27;re sharing passwords across services, whether or not you thought so.  The first thing that an attacker will do when they reverse your password is scan it for instances of the service name.  If your password is &quot;DropboxFoobar&quot;, it&#x27;s likely your Twitter&#x27;s is &quot;TwitterFoobar&quot;.  In fact, passwords of this type are the most valuable to an attacker, because it&#x27;s a surefire flag of &quot;You can get a ton of data from this person if they use the same scheme everywhere!&quot;  (When you reverse other types of passwords, it&#x27;s unclear whether it&#x27;s worth the effort to try it against a bunch of services.)<p>That said, anything to improve this situation is worthwhile effort.  Whether it&#x27;s a new hashing scheme or a public service video about the dangers of not using a password database, security improves incrementally.  Shielding a modern company is extremely hard, as it requires all employees to use the same security measures.  Anything that can be automated would be a win.<p>Are there other automatable things besides hashing?  Phishing attacks can&#x27;t be detected because they&#x27;re crafted so well.  SQL injection can be, though: Throw your server requests through a bayesian filter and watch it decide to put requests containing SELECT into their own class automatically.  Defenses to social engineering are close to impossible: if someone wants to get into your building, they&#x27;ll pose as a maintenance crew.  If they&#x27;re discovered, they&#x27;ll say &quot;Sorry, my work order must be for a different floor.&quot;<p>All in all, this is the general essence of why Sam Altman&#x27;s desire to fund new security companies is good, but might not produce many results.<p>So are incorrectly stored passwords really the problem?  Well... Not if you&#x27;re using bcrypt or scrypt.  Possibly this scheme; time will tell.  The research is valuable for other reasons too: it&#x27;s a whitepaper with source code, which is extremely rare.  Might be good to encourage more of that.",1442451022
10230941,comment,10230685,10230685,0,0,cossatot,,,"The hypocenter (location underground where the earthquake started) is fairly deep (~26 km according to the USGS) so hopefully the rupture didn&#x27;t reach the surface (it&#x27;s ambiguous but maybe 30% likely for an earthquake of this size with a hypocenter at that depth).  If it didn&#x27;t, then the likelihood of a damaging tsunami is far less because there isn&#x27;t a big displacement at the seafloor.<p>Interestingly, from the location it looks like it&#x27;s right at the northern edge of the rupture patch of the 2010 Maule earthquake (8.8), which was at the northern end of the 1960 ~9.4 earthquake (biggest on record).  These earthquake rupture patches are visible here[1].  The idea is that as the oceanic plate subducts, the upper part of the subduction zone/fault/megathrust is locked, i.e. the upper and lower plates are stuck together above 20-30 km, and elastic stress and strain accumulate slowly.  Then, this stress and strain is sporadically released as earthquakes, but these don&#x27;t rupture the entirety of the fault.  Instead, they happen in patches but an earthquake on one part of the fault adds more shear stress to the adjacent parts of the fault that didn&#x27;t rupture. This basically steps the clock forward on the adjacent part, so it ruptures next. In this way, the displacement accumulated along a big fault over centuries or millennia is released in a relatively shorter timespan, then a long period of quiescence sets in.<p>That&#x27;s a theory, anyway, and it&#x27;s almost certainly right in some places, some of the time.<p>A big research question for some (not necessarily funding agencies) is figuring out whether the shear stress released in these big earthquakes is a big or a small part of the accumulated background stress (stress is nigh impossible to measure directly).  If most of the shear stress is released, it&#x27;ll be a long time before another earthquake can occur on a given fault segment, but if only a little bit is released, then the potential energy is still there for another earthquake and it can happen again quicker than the full plate reloading time.  From a statistical perspective, a full stress release may correspond to periodic earthquakes while a partial release may correspond to a more random (i.e. Poisson) recurrence pattern.<p>If anyone is interested in this stuff, let me know here or email me (in my profile) and I can try to write up a blog post with it, and maybe with some Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate.<p>[1]: ftp://ftp.ingv.it/pub/alessio.piatanesi/PAPERS/2011_NGEO_Chile.pdf",1442451021

Some past violent incidents were perpetrated by white kids/persons. So if it were a white kid in this situation, can we absolutely discount 100% that similar amount of concern might have not been triggered in the class teacher&#x27;s mind, or the administration or police.<p>The point is, reasonable benefit of doubt can be given to the teacher, admin, police for going into a heightened/alert mode.<p>But what cannot be justified is the failure in subsequent analysis and diffusion of the tension at every level. The teacher could have clarified the intention, and diffused the tension and not escalated it after establishing facts (and the awareness of the enthusiasm and character of a kid of their own class that they should be familiar with). Or the next level, school security/admin could have diffused and de-escalated the situation.

Script asks you to choose a &quot;work factor,&quot; and the higher the work faster, the harder it is to reverse the hash.  Trouble is, if you set it too high, it&#x27;s a bit painful to change it later.  If you make a computationally difficult hashing scheme, then a lot of simultaneous logins can therefore force your server to use all of its CPU.<p>Does this suffer from the same issue?<p>It isn&#x27;t necessarily an important issue.  Maybe nobody will figure out they can take down your service that way.  Maybe rate limiting is enough.  Maybe you can solve it by having servers dedicated to hashing.<p>I was just curious about the performance characteristics:<p><i>Suppose that three people have passwords that are each randomly chosen and 6 characters long. A typical laptop can crack those passwords in about 1 hour.  If you take the same passwords and protect them with PolyPasswordHasher, every computer on the planet working together cannot crack the password in 1 hour. In fact, to search the key space, it would take every computer on the planet longer than the universe is estimated to have existed.</i><p>The contradiction is that if users can log in to your service quickly, then they can try a lot of passwords quickly.  So is this more expensive than scrypt?<p>If an attacker has read-only disk access, they can swipe any unencrypted data.

answer that is semantically close to identical to a monolithic repo.
Any work flow or command line works identically in both (there are a
few corner cases that don&#x27;t work but almost 100% of the stuff works
like you&#x27;d expect).<p>It&#x27;s sort of like a partial clone, you can clone any subset you want,
work on it, add in other parts, the tool takes care of making sure the
stuff you add in is lined up (if you cloned a week ago and you add in
another repo, it&#x27;s rolled back so it matches time/commit wise).<p>If you want to search for something it&#x27;s the same command in a collection
of repos as it is in a monolithic repo:<p><pre><code>        bk -U grep refactor_me
</code></pre>
but truth in advertising, that searches only what you have populated.
The google answer is &quot;ship grep to the data&quot; so they&#x27;ll search everything.
Google wins if you have their datacenter.  We win on UI, it&#x27;s the same
everywhere.<p>Our design is much more tightly coupled than Git&#x27;s submodules.  We manage
the subrepos so that they are in sync just like files are in sync.
What I mean by that is if you have two files modified in the same commit,
you can&#x27;t pull that commit and only get one of the files updated,
they are both updated because that&#x27;s what happened in that commit.
We&#x27;ve provided the same semantics for collections of repositories.
Git doesn&#x27;t, getting those semantics is an exercise left to the user.<p>We get better performance because you can clone as little as one
repository, what we call the product.  It would be easy and fun to put a
Unix distro in this system and have the top repo just have a makefile and
you type make X11 and it populates the compiler, libc, the X11 sources,
and builds them.<p>It&#x27;s commercial so maybe that&#x27;s uninteresting but if you want submodules
that work and scale in performance, we might be worth a look (sorry for
the marketing, if that&#x27;s against the rules here then I&#x27;ll learn how to
delete a post).<p>Read more here, comments welcome, it&#x27;s beta copy:<p><a href=""http://www.bitkeeper.com/nested"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitkeeper.com/nested</a>",1442449032

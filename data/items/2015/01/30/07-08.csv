8970987,comment,8970466,8970918,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You can turn this argument around too, though.<p>Imagine that you own a bus company in the South in the 1950s.  You personally believe that blacks should have every right that whites have, including the ability to sit up front.  However, if you passed that policy on your busses, all your white ridership would refuse to buy tickets.  Your bus drivers would quit.  Your shareholders would fire you.  And it&#x27;s all for naught anyway, because your customers would go to competing bus lines with bigoted owners who hire all your employees away.  So you make blacks go to the back of the bus, just like everyone else.<p>Does this mean Rosa Parks was incredibly naive?<p>On a pragmatic level, you&#x27;re right - companies are under constraints imposed by their stakeholders.  But if you&#x27;re talking moral philosophy or what is <i>right</i>, it&#x27;s not enough to make arguments based on what everybody else believes.  You need to be able to come up with some distinction that holds even if you swap white to black to gay.  Are people entitled to their <i>jobs</i>, regardless of their race?  Are they entitled to their <i>views</i>?  Are they entitled to make political contributions?  What are the basic rights that we choose to protect for our citizenry, regardless of the specific form that their expression takes?<p>Part of what made the Brendan Eich issue so problematic for a lot of people is that upholding his right to hold his own personal and political views is not inherently contradictory with upholding the rights of gay Mozilla employees & community members to have a safe working environment.  He had publicly promised to uphold Mozilla&#x27;s existing non-discriminatory and LGBT-friendly policies, and to prevent his personal views from interfering with his duties at Mozilla.",1422604729

8970984,comment,8966817,8970441,0,0,harperlee,,,"But businesses work on an accrual basis: once the contract is closed, and you can reasonably assume that some influx of capital is real, you put it in the accounting system.<p>And then: if I am a shareholder, and I own part of the company, why can&#x27;t I have access to the internal not-yet-audited general ledger status? It&#x27;s my company, right? It should be feasible to give me access to a secure site where I can get the information...<p>I believe the real reasons, rather than technical infeasibility, are mainly two:<p>- Extreme &quot;corporate governance&quot;: If shareholders can react on every minute transaction that you do, and they effectively micromanage the company, there is still more incentive for short-term thinking (a problem that a lot of listed companies are already very familiar with).<p>- Strategy: If competitors can buy one of your shares, they would get access to all your information. You can still do the same, though: on public companies, information is either public, or private. But who is going to start? Who is going to rush to be open to the competitor?",1422604672

Consider the difficulty in reducing dependency programs (e.g., SS, Medicare) - these are political non-starters due to old people voting.<p>On the cultural front, note how difficult it is even to criticize teachers or government dependents. Consider the media reaction when Romney correctly pointed out that about half the population is at least partly dependent on the government, or how right wing politicians are described as &quot;attacking&quot; teachers when they propose anything the educational establishment dislikes.<p>Or think for a moment about any policy which might reduce the status of either group - for example, partially replacing teachers with machines, or shaming people on welfare. How do you think such a policy would be received?",1422604646

8970981,comment,8970800,8970800,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I&#x27;ve recently launched a wiki based on MediaWiki, which is the first deployment of MediaWiki I&#x27;ve done in about a decade. I have been really impressed. They&#x27;ve got technical debt, sure, but they&#x27;re doing an excellent job paying it down, and moving forward without ever throwing away the whole project and starting over. I spent a lot of time evaluating wikis before relaunching this one (it was running on TWiki for years, on DokuWiki before that, and was a static site generated from DocBook XML or DocBook SGML before that), and was surprised to find MediaWiki was such a clear winner.<p>I probably shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised, given the resources behind it and the size of it&#x27;s userbase, but I still had notions that it would be like the MediaWiki of old: Slapped together rapidly, always barely ahead of the demands of WikiPedia and never having time to clean up and fix the warts.<p>I wrote a simple module for it, as well as an importer (using existing libraries to go from TWiki to MediaWiki markup, but we had some complexity coming over from such an old/large wiki), and found it really nice to work with. I don&#x27;t like that it stores content in the database, rather than on the filesystem, but they provide such a nice import/export tool that I forgave them. And, performance is good; at least as good as the TWiki it replaced (which was also sufficiently fast), and much faster than some of the other similarly busy sites I maintain (this site gets about 60,000 visitors a month and a couple hundred thousand pageviews, and runs on a modest 4GB VM alongside several other sites).<p>In short, MediaWiki is a great example of an old project aging very gracefully. I&#x27;m happy to be working with it again. I&#x27;d become frustrated with wikis after several painful upgrades of TWiki that kept breaking things further and further until the site was barely functional Likewise, while DokuWiki and MoinMoin were great tools and I&#x27;ve used them to good effect a number of times, they haven&#x27;t really seen the kind of advancements MediaWiki has had.",1422604614

It absolutely is an organized strategy by the left.<p>Anti-oppression activism is founded on social constructionist theories. These claim that bigotry and prejudice are subtly reproduced in society through language. So activists are scrupulous in cleansing their speech of any hint of prejudiced beliefs, no matter how minor, because they believe that if they can accomplish that, prejudice itself will disappear.<p>But people who aren&#x27;t activists are also reproducing prejudice through their speech, so the problem becomes how can you get all of them to stop doing that too. The answer is to make it morally unacceptable. Minor phrases like &quot;man up&quot; turn into huge ethical lapses that are worthy of censure and shaming.<p>Not using those phrases become matters of empathy and not being an asshole towards unknown persons who are offended. But really, no one is offended, it&#x27;s just a tactic for redefining linguistic norms.",1422604473

8970973,comment,8970466,8970466,0,0,Xcelerate,,,"I absolutely detest the way some people &quot;argue&quot; and attempt to shame their opponent.  Shaming doesn&#x27;t work on me; it just pisses me off.  As soon as someone begins attacking me as a person instead of my argument, I lose all patience with them and honestly start to view them as stupid and incapable of rational thought.  The conversation on their end normally contains an implicit assumption that their viewpoint is automatically the correct one (no willingness to even <i>hear</i> other perspectives), and personal attack techniques include phrases like, &quot;you are trolling&quot; (even though half the US population shares the &quot;troll&quot; viewpoint), &quot;the flaw in your argument is...&quot;, &quot;unless you are a [something genetically immutable], your privileged white male opinion does not matter&quot;.  Pull up the list of logical fallacies on Wikipedia and they hit almost every single one of them.<p>I have had calm, rational debates with people who have viewpoints that are completely opposite to mine.  Both of us come away from the conversation feeling enlightened, and occasionally one of us changes our mind on an issue because of a persuasive argument.  This is what a good debate should be like.  But unfortunately, people who can debate like this are few and far between.<p>Far more often I just end up frustrated and leave the &quot;debate&quot; part way through.  So many people get angry and emotional if you criticize their viewpoint, and I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to deal with it.  Although sometimes if I&#x27;m in a good mood, I will stir things up for entertainment: if I am listening to a debate between two people I know, and one of them is using shaming tactics and logical fallacies, I will join in on the conversation (if permitted) and automatically take the side <i>against</i> theirs, even if I have the exact same viewpoint that they do.  Then I will tear their argument down the best way I know how (it&#x27;s fun to argue against your own belief).  And at the end I will reveal that my viewpoint was actually the same as theirs.",1422604409

8970967,comment,8966789,8970003,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The causes of cochlear hearing loss are multiple and diverse. Loud noises will do it for anyone, but many people have one of a dozen-odd kinds of non-syndromic hearing loss that are generally due to single point defects (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms or SNPs) in the gene COCH, which codes for an important cochlear protein. There are also multiple multi-gene or developmental syndromes that result in cochlear hearing loss (not all hearing loss is cochlear, although a great deal of it is.)<p>Most cochlear hearing loss is symptomatically similar, although a degree of disorientation is more common in non-syndromic loss due to SNPs, but because the causes are so diverse what works for one person--even granted there are such things--will be completely useless for most others. It is very important to keep this in mind, because you don&#x27;t appear to have more than incrementally useful evidence that your son&#x27;s milder tinnitus is due to magnesium rich foods. A single case is simply not very useful for increasing the posterior plausibility of the claim &quot;X causes Y&quot;.<p>Remember, reasoning is fundamentally Bayesian, and Bayes&#x27; rule is:<p>p(X|E) = p(X)P(E|X)/P(E)<p>where in this case p(X) = prior plausibility of claim X that &quot;magnesium rich foods reduce tinnitus&quot;, P(E|X) = probability of your son&#x27;s tinnitus being reduced given X is true and P(E) = probability that your son&#x27;s tinnitus wouldn&#x27;t be so bad anyway. p(X|E) = posterior plausibility of the claim X given your observation that your son&#x27;s tinnitus is not so bad and he ate lots of magnesium rich foods.<p>Your prior p(X) will be different than mine: plausibilities are subjective, unlike probabilities, which are objective... it could hardly be otherwise as plausibilities are degrees of belief and you can&#x27;t have a belief without a believer... that is to say, a subject. But what matters is the ratio P(E|X)/P(E), the ratio of probabilities. Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that P(E|X) is 1-&epsilon;, as high as it can be. If &quot;magnesium rich foods reduce tinnitus&quot; is true, your son&#x27;s hearing would almost certainly get better.<p>But here&#x27;s the question: what is the <i>natural variablity of tinnitus</i>? That&#x27;s basically what P(E) depends on. If tinnitus varies a lot due to time or circumstances, the P(E) is also going to be pretty high (well aboe &epsilon;, at least) and therefore the posterior plausibility p(X|E) is not going to go up by much (a factor of two is incremental: interesting arguments and evidence involve many orders of magnitude increases).<p>So although it isn&#x27;t obvious (and forgive me for belabouring the point... I just got hooked on this example) when you claim &quot;it was magnesium rich foods that helped&quot; you are actually asserting &quot;I know what the natural variability of tinnitus is&quot;, due to the argument above.<p>And my question to you is: do you? If so: how?<p>I&#x27;ve gone through this in detail here because this kind of reasoning is incredibly common, where a person pulls a single fact out and presents it as &quot;proof&quot; for some proposition (and you may not have meant to do that here, but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reading into your words and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m wrong in suggesting others will read in the same thing... my apologies if I&#x27;ve taken you wrong!) When someone says, &quot;I did X and Y happened so I know X causes Y&quot; they are saying, &quot;I know what the natural variability of Y is&quot;.<p>I would encourage anyone on the receiving end of such an argument to ask them what the natural variability of Y is, because if they do not have that knowledge, they do not have a legitimate--which is to say, Bayesian--claim on the conclusion they wish to draw.",1422604316

When such people are close to attaining power, actually achieving it is the only thing that matters to them.  They often become just as dogmatic oppressors as the people they fought against.  It takes time to learn higher-level &quot;languages&quot; like empathy, or justice, or reasoned argument, and typically these skills can only be learned in a situation where you have a certain baseline of personal power.

But that is not an issue, because (in most bootstrap scenarios I&#x27;m considering) language acquisition happens before (or alongside) acquiring the intelligence necessary to understand itself to the point of re-formulating itself. So we <i>can</i> formulate the tests in English, and subject to the language acquisition having succeeded (which we can establish independently) we can trust that the tests are correctly understood.<p>This actually makes the tests <i>more</i> robust, because the AI self-describing its own plans in its own internal &quot;vocabulary&quot; is quite able to recognize vague associations, such as the is-it-death-or-not scenario you describe. If it is a similar enough conception that it can be (internally) described as &quot;death&quot;, (past a threshold), it will (with a testably sufficient probability) trigger the associated constraints.<p>The idea that a &quot;buggy&quot; intelligence could acquire language, and understand it at a level sufficient to &quot;digest&quot; advanced technical material, is sufficiently unlikely.<p>More to the point, the &quot;ethical&quot; tests and constraints are only the topmost level of a pyramid of testing that ensures that all the pieces perform exactly as intended along the way. The system at no point behaves in a random or inexplicable way. So by the time such capabilities are unlocked we know that the algorithm works in accordance with theory.<p>You are also completely right that this initial &quot;dumb-almost-AI&quot; would have to be pretty smart already. The trick is that it grows within a set hardcoded framework at first, which is sufficiently flexible to allow it to in fact perform language acquisition and (later) intelligent design.<p>Only then would re-writing its own hard-coded base become interesting. Therefore the design I am working on already passes human-level capabilities. But that does not mean the AI cannot improve itself even further. And the trouble in the context we were discussing it in is that we need to be sure that if it does rewrite itself - and in a way that we might not be able to easily comprehend - it <i>still</i> cannot break out of the mold.<p>As far as the goal function is concerned, it is as you can imagine rather complicated to do. And the solution will undoubtedly differ based on the architecture you are working in.<p>What I&#x27;m doing personally is pretty straight-forward; it involves iterative constraint solving using quantitative metrics to increase trust and/or doubt in various concepts and plans, and this trust is established based on consistency and coherence with previously acquired (probabilistic) background &quot;knowledge&quot; - as well as consistency within any single context of thought. A single context might be a sentence or a paragraph reading, or a logical puzzle being solved, etc.<p>Over time the probabilities increase (at least, in theory), both for any single consideration and across the entire knowledgebase. (See NELL [1] for comparison. Except, it&#x27;s a lot smarter than NELL.)<p>So the goal function is a fairly generic optimisation algorithm, and the initial goals defined are equally generic - increasing overall consistency, coherence, and efficiency. (Measuring these is fairly straight-forward.)<p>The trick is in setting up the reward structure autonomously, so it keeps advancing itself. The learning algorithm needs to create sensible (long-lived) intermediate goals and maintain their relative priorities over time. Among other things.<p>(I really can&#x27;t explain <i>how</i> it works though without going over a whole bunch of other supporting algorithms).<p>In any case, to begin with the A.I. need not have a desire to do anything at all except <i>learn</i> - and it improves within the constraints of the hard-coded base framework. But the model can still advance (at least, in theory) to the point where it acquires the <i>ability</i> to comprehend its own design and re-engineer itself completely.<p>By this time however it is able to understand and apply the ethical constraints we defined in English, alongside all the other intermediate goals (but with specific higher priority).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/</a>",1422603101

I have to be very careful chatting with them, because while they each separately are very articulate and reasoned in their arguments, I cannot even pretend to identify with any of the other side without risking very strongly being labeled and shut out of further discussion.<p>You&#x27;d think you could get these people to agree to sit down and calmly hear each other out, maybe critique each other&#x27;s positions, and perhaps agree to disagree--but no.<p>No, instead one side will immediately feel like they are being judged and condescended to and set up for mocking, and the other will feel that they are probably tempting a campaign of harassment and stalking and abuse. Neither can talk openly and freely because they <i>assume</i> that the other person, once flagged as the opposition, will be doing everything disingenuously. One cannot have reasoned discussions in such an environment.<p>And if you <i>do</i> agree with the people who are either side of GamerGate? You&#x27;re either siding with people who use threats and really sloppy language (&quot;SJW&quot; as a catchall for any goddamn thing that even is remotely related, good or bad), or siding with people who bully and pander and conduct successful mass-media campaigns belittling their opponents. Like, nobody deserves to win this.<p>~<p>The thing that&#x27;s most annoying to me, though, is that one side you can kind of reason with, because you slowly wittle away the crazy into an admission that &quot;Well, yeah, we should treat them with some class, I guess. Death threats aren&#x27;t actually okay.&quot;<p>The other side, though, has made central to its position a sort of victimhood, and that is a position very hard to navigate somebody out of.

Your allies are busy calling in bomb threats and making the most puerile gestures and getting so damned emotional in their trolling they losing sight of the big picture--and playing right into the hands of their opponents.<p>It&#x27;s just so goddamn frustrating.<p>The exact same thing plays out in politics: one side will make fun of and harass the other side, and that side will continually play the abused and purge anybody who doesn&#x27;t fall in with them.<p>And between the two of them, there&#x27;s simply no place for anybody who doesn&#x27;t want to look like a buffoon or an opportunistic victim.",1422601639

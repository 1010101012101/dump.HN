Then you could modify the code any way you wanted, and others could use your modifications. This was before they went the custom social network route.<p>$44M is a ridiculous amount of money, but there might be some potential if they want to get back to their original vision.",1184037574

Say I want to organize an event for Facebook Apps developers, but I need help with the expenses. I put up a pledge for, say, $200, and link to it from my blog. If enough people pledge and the cost is covered, then I'll setup the event. Otherwise, I'll know that there is not enough interest. And, of course, software can still be a category for those who need software built.",1184036961

33392,comment,33350,33381,0,0,wmorein,,,"OK, I see what you mean now -- I assumed this was a typo.<p>I'm still not sure that I agree. I don't think that recent history has shown that the opening price (i.e. the first price at which the public can buy shares) is any higher if the ibankers significantly underprice the stock. In essence, all that should matter to you is that opening price. If it is too high, then you shouldn't buy.<p>If the stock is underpriced, then it is true that there will be less capital that goes into the business so the valuation you use to decide whether to make the investment would have to take that into account. Given the way that I'm guessing that Facebook will be valued, I have to think that any possible loss due to underpricing will be vanishingly small compared to the overall market cap of the company.<p>I can understand a philosophical reason not to invest if it is underpriced, but not a real economic one.<p>One other note -- if the IPO is underpriced, the payout goes not directly to the ibankers but rather to the people that get allocations. These are usually big customers like hedge funds or other people with an ""in"" with the ibankers (e.g. execs of other companies that might go public, although this stuff has slowed down). Obviously the expectation is that these people will benefit the bankers in the long run, but the payment is not direct.",1184036474

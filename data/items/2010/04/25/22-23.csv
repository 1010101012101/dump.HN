1293681,comment,1293262,1293262,0,0,goodside,,,"I accept that some people, perhaps even most people, are fully immune to anything like Internet addiction. If you're one of those people, great. I envy you. But I can say from first-hand experience that compulsive Internet use (""Internet addiction"" is a casual misnomer at best) is real. Further, I very strongly suspect that low-latency Internet connections, up-to-the-minute news and blogs, and social sharing of content have exacerbated such compulsions by enabling and rewarding rapid-fire consumption and shallow analysis of content.<p>I doubt these inventions are the only cause of Internet compulsion, but they encourage it in people who have pre-existing compulsive tendencies. Analogously, gambling addiction is known to be caused by excessive dopaminergic activity in the brain, but that doesn't change the fact there would be less of it if there were no casinos.<p>Many studies show ( <a href=""http://bit.ly/deum0v"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/deum0v</a> ) that compulsive Internet use responds to the same sorts of medications used to treat OCD, namely SSRI antidepressants. You might want to consider speaking with a doctor if your use is really that severe. For me, they have helped considerably.",1272235975

1293677,comment,1292819,1293208,0,0,earl,,,"Well, there are two ways to deal with employee churn.  The first is to create such an awesome work environment (via wages, stock options / golden handcuffs, learning opportunities, career growth, flexibility, etc etc -- whatever it is that works for individual employees) that people laugh at the recruiters that inevitably call.  The other way, which Marc advocates, is to create systemic discrimination against employees that seek out the best opportunities for themselves.  This is contrary to Marc <i>providing</i> the best opportunities for employees.<p>Consider, as an example, the Mahalo stuff that started this.  Jason's employee was given the opportunity to use his web dev skills on a much higher profile site and to work on a big open source toolkit (I assume he was referring to YUI or similar).  Jason could either have wished his employee the best as said employee tried to take his career to the next stage, or provided him with some similar opportunity to convince him to stay, or... advocated for a system in which employees have difficulty switching jobs in order to keep the employee in an inferior position solely for the benefit of Jason.  This is what Marc wants.<p>Note that in Marc's article, there was <i>nothing</i> about retaining employees by creating such an awesome environment that they don't want to leave.  Oh, and btw?  Here's a protip.  If a dev in the valley making $100-$150 leaves for a $10K/year raise?  It isn't the money.  It's the boss.  I claim that except for exceptional cases, salary is a 2nd or 3rd tier consideration for most great employees.<p>So, does Marc's advocacy of keeping employees by urging employers to systematically discriminate against people that switch jobs to find their best place that make him an asshole?  In my book, yes.<p>ps -- protip #2?  One way to discourage people from saying their boss sucked was to discourage it, ala Marc.  The other way is to not be a shit boss.  Again, Marc chooses the first path.",1272235792

1293675,comment,1293401,1293603,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"Ron Conway would be privy to plans of many companies, and in connecting it reinforces his deal flow as startups think ""he may not invest, but he may know a first customer or an alliance partner with whom he is also privy, and then if he does invest, we know he'll be doing the same for us permanently without us asking."" In this case, Conway's benefit from the connecting is a reputation of such that causes further deal flow, and this is the fuel of his business.<p>Other forms of monetizing connecting include finders fees, commissions, and direct work to realize the connection, eg documentation in an M & A deal. But if the connecting has no direct benefit to oneself in the ways mentioned, the only thing one can expect to gain at best is improving one's aura, frequently just being sidetracked, or at worst doing something for a competitor.<p>-- if one does a random connect and one has no direct relevancy to the underlying commerce, the parties at best may remember you if you ask for some type of help later (they may also request or expect more free service from you, seeing you as a sucker), and at worst want to avoid you in the event they fear you'll want or demand a share of the gains later from the success of the connection with which they never requested.",1272235667

Let me know if I'm off track.<p>Isn't it more accurate to say that ""description,"" rather than ""information,"" is the root of everything? Information itself is pretty abstract, so it seems far more useful to do it this way.",1272233070
1293618,comment,1293245,1293480,0,0,Qz,,,"Consider a computer program with access to the memory in which the program is running and no other inputs.  The program is information, and only has access to information.  The information is embodied in some set of hardware, but the computer program has no way of knowing or accessing this hardware (and we assume the hardware is 100% reliable, e.g. no memory faults due to overheating RAM or whatnot).  So from the perspective of the program, everything is information, including the program itself.  Substitute 'conscious mind' for 'program' and you have a conscious mind in a world of nothing but information.  The fact that a 'hard' world exists outside of the 'soft' world is irrelevant, by virtue of being unknowable.",1272233064

On the main graphic in the middle of the page where it says ""Matchio is The best way to buy and sell your books locally. Period."" the letters run together when I view it in Safari 4.0.4<p>2.  On the very bottom, the ""Learn More"" section, I feel that this is kind of an unnecessary use of JS animation.  This section is asking for feedback, and provides useful links so if you don't expand it you might never see this info.  I would just keep it expanded.<p>3.  Everything under ""Feedback"" in the learn more section does the same thing.<p>4.  Privacy policy and Terms of Services links don't do anything (I'm guessing they already know that though)<p>5.  I also noticed in the source that there's a lot of inline Javascript, some in using JQuery, some not.  I would try to keep it consistent and I'd throw it all inside of $(document).ready() to keep the markup cleaner, plus everything inside here will be ready to be used immediately after the DOM is loaded.",1272232853

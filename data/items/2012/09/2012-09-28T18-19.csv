It was a big bet and high risk so I'm not surprised it hasn't caught on.  The concepts and thinking behind the idea, in my opinion, was rock solid and more true to how real networks work.

There are four types of people who stay at Microsoft:<p>1) Top performers who are on a fast-track (<1% of workforce)<p>2) People who can't get jobs elsewhere (30%)<p>3) People who have families and are tied to Redmond area (40%)<p>4) People who can get jobs elsewhere but have visa restrictions and are afraid to upset their status (30%)<p>Everyone else leaves or has already left within 2 years.  I joked with a colleague yesterday, ""Hey, have you talked to anyone from the old team?"" ""Yeah, I've been forwarding their resumes...""<p>Microsoft is working to reduce people in #2 and #3 through its performance review system.  They then want to increase people in #4 so they have more people who can't leave them as they start cost cutting when Win8 isn't a roaring success.<p>I personally find it heart-wrenching to watch friends who would leave their abusive situations and work for a start-up but cannot due to silly visa paperwork.  I just don't trust that Microsoft would want more people to come without restrictions to work for a specific company.  It does't benefit them at all.<p>I just wish skilled computer science people could work for whomever they want.  Our industry would be so much better off.

Previously, our company used Quickbooks Online and used the 'estimate' feature as their inventory of systems. THis was horrible so on my own time at home, I slowly modified and made a new ticketing system. I started using it for myself to manage repairs better and it worked great. The manager caught notice of the system and suggested we used it to replace the current system. At the time, I programmed EVERYTHING at home in my spare time. I was not given any company time to work on this. I was an hourly employee what the system got implemented. Three months later I was promoted to a salary position(basically made me the 'Network Admin + Lead Tech'). They would give me input on problems here and there and I would write fixes for them. I did this a few times for them. Fast forward another 6 months, and I am ready to leave this company. The system I made is our primary and only system in place now and I believe it is my property. I realize the database information belongs to them and that is not what I want. I want to just prevent them from further use once I do leave. Any input would be appreciated.",1348858451

It's painful for Apple to break free of Google. But if it successfully does this, it will become a true competitor to Google on several fronts. The question is, can their brand survive the backlash? My guess is YES. Their coffers are huge. They will hire and catch up in these areas -- and afterwards probably start to innovate. Most of all, they have some of the greatest designers and branding people there. Google is mostly about engineers.

These things are great for educational purposes, and the low cost makes them a lot of fun for classes and workshops.

Everyone wants to hire seasoned veterans, because logically those people reach a higher level of productivity much faster and require less development talent/skill set wise. While there is a specious logic to this, it's extremely short-sided. Everyone starts at the bottom and needs an opportunity to grow and get their initial experience from somewhere.<p>Even with experienced individuals, companies often don't want to pay the premium that substantial experience in a field will confer. There were some interesting news stories (don't remember the actual links, but they're easily google-able) about the large numbers of former NASA engineers laid off in the last year having tremendous difficultly finding new employment. The interesting part is that it wasn't that they weren't getting job offers, on the contrary many employers seemed to be eager to hire highly qualified individuals with 20+ years of high quality experience, they just didn't want to pay for it. These people were getting offers that were literally a fraction of the salaries they were commanding previously.<p>You can't have it both ways. If you want experience, pay for it.

In the course of two days it became very clear how deep and ambitious - socially and culturally - Bush's most central ideas were. At every turn we were reminded that Bush was writing about how fundamentally new intellectual practices could change the entire landscape of human social life. Bush's vision was not just about hypertext, or data management, or information retrieval, let alone about microfilm or calculating machines; rather, it was about extending the power of human beings by giving them radically new ways of working together.<p>The goal of fundamentally changing how we work in order to address pressing human problems continued to be central throughout the development of Bush's legacy in the '60s and '70s, most obviously in the work of Engelbart, Nelson, and Kay. Its continued evidence throughout the symposium - even (perhaps most notably)in the presentation of Tim Berners-Lee, the youngest speaker - and the warm response of the audience made it clear that this optimistic social agenda still resonates. It seems that we are not too jaded, skeptical, or post-modern to believe, 50 years later, that technology can bring us 'a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge', one that will promote 'the application of science to the needs and desires of man' ('As We May Think').""<p>from <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/memex/Bush_Symposium_Interact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.brown.edu/memex/Bush_Symposium_Interact.html</a>",1348856177

But if you loosen them only in a narrow segment of the economy and while restricting mobility in others, you may end up creating severe market distortions that don't resemble a free market in any way.<p>If almost every country and profession had equally liberal immigration policies, then yes, I'd agree.  But we're not doing this evenly, and I think this is why so many people who hold a favorable general view of immigration nonetheless object to these targeted visa/green card programs. As it stands, I think that adding a green card to every STEM degree (but not every JD, MD, MBA, DDS, etc) will end up creating market distortions that will probably just further deter US citizens from entering this field, amplifying the cycle of ""shortages"" and perhaps eventually creating exactly the ""crisis"" that the policy is intended to address.",1348855869

What features could they have actually cut from the Maps app? The mistakes in 3D meshes and fuzzy terrain tiles make for the biggest point-and-laugh screen caps, and perhaps they could have cut that, but that would have caused just as much screaming. And the biggest issues really seem to be with the POI database, which you can't launch without. (And which, it should be noted, isn't something that Apple built on their own; at least in part, what Apple Maps is revealing is how bad a lot of <i>other</i> third-party geographic databases are compared to Google's.)<p>As for Apple's culture, well. I don't have <i>special</i> knowledge of it but I live in Silicon Valley and know a few people who've worked there or continue to work there, and your description about it doesn't seem to me to be accurate. There was a great deal of <i>respect</i> for Steve Jobs but there was no perception that he was always right. People did in fact push back against him, and he'd often listen. (And in cases where he didn't, there's still some controversy going on.) I think you're correct to surmise that there's a lot of arrogance in Apple's culture, mind you -- but I can assure you that Google's matches Apple's ego for ego.

Please investigate getting your file sizes down.  I think you can shrink the file sizes of your mp4 video to 1/3 the current size but keep the same resolution/quality.<p>Update:  Your optins-teardowns.mp4 file is absent.  I can't download it.

That's the _best_ way, although probably not the easiest or most convenient.<p>I know of several angel investors, but it all depends on what your product is, and who your ideal investor would be.  Why don't you send me a message and we'll chat?  I'm one of the 3 guest bloggers at Go BIG Network.",1197078934

87198,comment,87132,87132,0,0,utnick,,,"Here is one thing you could do ( inspired by that youtube video marketer guy on techcrunch )<p>1. Nobody wants to join an empty social site. Either do it yourself or pay some people in 3rd world countries to have multiple accounts on your site and make it look popular. Each story should have hundreds of votes and there should be 10s if not hundreds of comments, its better if there is heated debate or discussion going on in the comments<p>2. Once it has the appearance of being popular, Time to make it popular. <p>-You could pretend to be a ron paul supporter and point out to other ron paul supporters that ron paul is getting the bad end of one your questions, and then 1000s of ron paul supporters would rush to your site to correct it.<p>-You could make a facebook app for it.<p>-You could do traditional advertising on other news or news related blogs.",1197077480

I would suggest you need to get over being shy about it and your first post should have had the URL. Also, track down anyone who blogs about your area (social news sites/poll sites) and contact them to let them announce you and or start commenting intelligently on their blogs.<p>Google will start bringing digg-like sites traffic based on your unique keyword combos after a while. I would post to some free directories to boost pagerank (but not paid links or directories) to help this happen sooner. There are also free forums for link announcements. These won't bring you much traffic directly, but google still is awarding some rank for the links and you will probably start placing for off-beat combos. I was getting google traffic for ""huffing purel"" for a while after a friend made a comment joking about that.<p>Google Analytics is a great tool.  I suggest adwords to get some starter traffic. Be warned, my users were so lazy ( less than 1% post and almost none vote) that I started populating it using scrapers. They will lurk though and read your content. So if you get bored talking to yourself, try and build traffic fast. Avoid Adbrite if you do this--the traffic is worthless.<p>Anyhow, those are my tips...",1197077363

87194,comment,86993,87186,0,0,AF,,,"You can directly compare the speed of an application or a language.<p>It is not subjective to say 'C is faster than Perl' or 'Perl is faster than Ruby'. That is true, in almost every instance, C IS faster than the equivalent Perl code and the equivalent Perl code is faster than Ruby (whether that holds true for Ruby 1.9 we shall see).<p>On the other hand, what constitutes a 'strong' implementation of OO is purely subjective. Would you consider Common Lisp's implementation of OO 'strong'? It is completely different than how Ruby works. But it isn't any more or less OO, it is a different way of doing it. Now if we really want to get into subjectiveness, Smalltalkers would probably say that Ruby's OO is not 'strong' because Ruby resorts to not making conditionals actual objects, unlike Smalltalk, in which literally just about everything is an object.<p>You might even say that Python is more OO than Ruby because functions are objects in Python but methods are not similar first-class constructs in Ruby (note: I wouldn't actually argue this, but it is just an example of how the languages do something differently).",1197076988

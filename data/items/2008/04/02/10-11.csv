What you can't do is put whatever you like on someone else's iPhone.  In that case, Apple insists that you play by their rules, so that their customers can have confidence that the software they buy isn't going to break their wonderful new iPhone.  Apple is essentially offering a service to people where Apple evaluates the technical qualities of software so that users don't have to.<p>If you can't get passed Apple's rules, why should you care?  Write for another platform then.  If your idea is so hot, you are going to have loads of users anyway. People may even buy the phone you support, just to have your software.<p>Of course, if what you really wanted was an easy ride on Apple's coattails, I have bad news for you - Apple never gives anyone an easy ride on their coattails...  But I'm hardly going to cry a river for you.",1207132894

She's inspirational because watching a small child come to grips with the world and discover it makes you look again at things you take for granted and see them as new again.<p>For example, I showed her the pendulum of a clock and how it swings back and forth based on its length (not the size of the weight or the angle it starts at).   The length of a pendulum counting seconds is where we get the length one metre from.  So time and space come together in such a simple thing.  Also you can use a pendulum to show the rotation of the earth.<p>So many simple and beautiful things to discover.  Also, the original measurement of the metre was done by Mersenne of primes fame.   BTW, did you ever notice how children count things by pointing at them one by one and saying the number?  That sort of counting let's you can go straight to Cantor's pairing function that the number of rationals is the same as the number of naturals.  It's child's play.<p>(OK, better stop of I'm going to turn into James Burke: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_</a>(TV_series))<p>2. My A level Advanced Maths teacher who told me that there was ""a Group, Ring or Field lurking in every corner"".   He showed me the beauty of logic and studying systems specified by a few axioms.<p>3. When I was about 6 years old my parents took me to Cambridge for a couple of days organized by the National Association for Gifted Children (<a href=""http://www.nagcbritain.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nagcbritain.org.uk/</a>) where I remember clearly a man (no doubt a Cambridge don) explaining to me the theoretical operation of a computer.   It was only years later that I realized that he had explained the operation of a Turing Machine.  I was utterly fascinated.",1207131644

And they seem to have done OK.<p>Often names of companies sound ingenious because they just seem to fit so well to the company, but what people tend to forget is that the reason the name fits the company is because your association of the two are linked. Google is an example - there are probably thousands of names that are just as good, but they don't sound it because they have no mindshare. Google sounds like a great name because you recognise it instantly and associate it with a great company - nothing more.<p>As long as you can get the .com domain (or be creative like del.icio.us) and make sure you don't infringe on trademarks you'll be fine.<p>And you should also google your proposed name just to see what else it means. There is a classic story of an upscale bathroom factory that called their new line of showers for goldenshower. Bad idea.",1207131216

I bet I could do it with half the staff in have the time. Pissing away money is easy.

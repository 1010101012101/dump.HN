Same holds true for the necessary servers they maintain.<p>Don&#x27;t get this wrong please: this is still probably THE best solution right now, which simply as well has its security limitations, right?<p>Is there any work ongoing on a kind of &quot;verification process&quot; for Apps like these?

10958101,comment,10951130,10957204,0,0,aikah,,,"> This is an artifact of the maximum complexity of front end apps having risen dramatically in recent years.<p>Front-end apps aren&#x27;t more complex. Back in 2006-7 people were already writing complex front-end apps with frameworks like GWT or ext-js. What changed is front-end developers dropped the widget oriented frameworks for a lower level approach (stateless components). But the complexity of the apps have not risen.<p>You don&#x27;t need IoC containers with javascript, it&#x27;s useful but not mandatory. Angular2 tries to be some kind of kitchen sink of web frameworks but is losing its pragmatism in the process. I can guarantee that it will be drag its adoption speed.",1453550342

10958099,comment,10956996,10957750,0,0,geocar,,,"A lot of things need to be considered when designing a new protocol.<p>Versioning is clearly <i></i><i>not</i><i></i> enough: IP for example has <i>many</i> version fields, but that&#x27;s not helping IPv6&#x27;s adoption. You may not be able to &quot;replace all the old versions&quot; if your protocol becomes popular, so you need to consider how you will update it anyway.<p>Tags are worth study: If ECN had been implemented as a new IP option instead of appropriating a bit that &quot;everyone should be ignoring&quot; we would&#x27;ve avoided a lot of problems a few years ago.<p>Differentiating between &quot;must implement to operate&quot; and &quot;may implement&quot; is also useful. Sometimes you can add this with a flag or special notation (e.g. PNG and RIFF), but for protocols you can also use negotiation: Telnet&#x27;s WILL/WON&#x27;T/DO/DON&#x27;T/CAN/CAN&#x27;T system, for example.<p>Specifying failure cases is also good: To make sure people implement reliable systems, I often design into the spec the retry protocol and have a mode (used in interoperation) that causes random failures so they have to implement the retry protocol correctly.",1453550204

I believe if the EU could survive for another decade or so, it will be in a much better shape. IMO the politics of free movement inside the EU changes the lives and behavior of those affected(e.g. students having the chance to live & study in a totally different culture and environment) in a way that makes is almost impossible for them to accept a reversal to the old status-quot. When the generations that are currently criss-crossing in the halls of european universities will get a chance to influence the politics I believe we&#x27;ll see a much more aligned &quot;european identity&quot;.",1453550187
10958097,comment,10957794,10958001,0,0,jcfrei,,,"I would also question whether this period of peace in Europe is really due to the EU. The EU and it&#x27;s predecessors certainly contributed to it, but I would argue it&#x27;s a marginal contribution. If you look at world history after WWII you see that major conflicts - between two powerful nations - have largely disappeared. Instead we got a slew of proxy wars: US vs. China in Korea, US vs. China/USSR in Vietnam or Iran vs. Saudi Arabia in Syria more recently. I think the reason for this is purely economical. No country can afford in the late 20th century to break all diplomatic ties with another country (and their allies), so instead of engaging in an all out war they support local regimes or mercenaries whilst maintaining the necessary economic relations with supporters of opposing regimes. In Europe meanwhile the economies have become so interconnected (even before the EU) that any war would mean economic devastation for the whole region and is thus an impossible course for any regime.",1453550168

Experimentation and the like are important, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you get to throw away the term &quot;minimum viable product&quot;.<p>This article is more about &quot;how to find out what an MVP might be&quot;.<p>> An MVP is not just a product with half of the features chopped out<p>Right, it&#x27;s supposed to be the absolute core of what is necessary. This requires actually knowing what your customers <i>want</i>. It&#x27;s perfectly OK to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know what our MVP should be&quot; and then go and try and find out what it should be. But until you have something that is actually viable as a product then you don&#x27;t have a MVP.<p>> You spend months figuring out how to launch custom mobile apps for your clients, only to find out that what a restaurant owner really wants is a mobile-optimized website that’s easy to find on Google.<p>So you added an extra feature that&#x27;s unwanted and failed to add a required feature. This is neither minimum, nor viable.<p>> Or, after using all the latest technologies to build real-time chat, you find out that restaurant owners can barely deal with email and don’t want to sit at a computer all day.<p>Adding an extra feature nobody needs means you&#x27;ve not built a minimum product.<p>> Or, worst of all, you might find out that restaurant owners don’t want the hassle of dealing with technology and maintaining mobile apps and have no interest in using your product in the first place.<p>Then you haven&#x27;t built a viable product.<p>> Therefore, the very first MVP could be a mockup of such a mobile app<p>Not really, since this isn&#x27;t a viable product.<p>edit - I think this is a common issue, people taking terms and then bringing in what they &quot;really mean&quot;. A &quot;minimum viable product&quot; is a very simple description. If what you have isn&#x27;t a viable product, then I really do not understand the point of saying you&#x27;ve built a minimum viable product.",1453550165

[...] one of the guys I&#x27;d sat next to in the intro to engineering class invited me to rush his fraternity. [...] I met so many amazing, awesome people it blew my mind.<p>So I find this slightly confusing, because in my experience of university, the fact I was living in dorms already offered me the opportunities to meet people that you&#x27;re talking about.\nPretty much from the day I arrived, people were sat talking in the corridors, and everyone else was as anxious to meet new people as I was, so I don&#x27;t know how I could have avoided making friends.<p>That said, I do know that despite my social anxieties, I tend to be pretty comfortable talking to people I don&#x27;t know that well (if anything, more so than people I do), so that might have made it easier than I realised.<p>One thing that does occur to me though, is in the UK alcohol is readily available to students. I realise US colleges are hardly dry, but I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s not quite the same as the UK, where almost every student will have their own stock of preferred drinks ready for any social occasion.",1453550040

The national state is not exactly living a revival. This is majorly a financial crisis.<p>I might be wrong, but it&#x27;s not my impression that the US laws are a hodgepodge of compromises between states. In many ways the US is more coherent. Americans are also viewing themselves as Americans first, secondly as Irish, Latino, whatever their ancestors origin might be. Only rarely do Americans define themselves as being Idahoan, Washingtonian or Michigander (Exception are Texan, New Yorker and maybe Californian). For most people in the EU European wont even be their second level identification, for me personally it might be third or forth level.<p>My point being that not wanting the EU or parts of it, has no consequences for my identity in the same way if would for a person in the US wanting his or her state to at least partially leave the union.<p>The nation state are seeing a revival. Areas like Catalonia want to be their own small separate nation, Scotland considered leaving the UK. Many EU members also want to move power from a distant and anonymous EU parliament, and give it back to their national parliaments.

I think a lot of us (people in tech) suffer from impostor syndrome at times; the approach that helped me to overcome it is &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot;, especially in your internal dialogue.  Try your best to project confidence in your abilities, and (more importantly) squash that little voice in your head that says you&#x27;re not good enough whenever you hear it - even if you&#x27;re inclined to agree with it.<p>I know this is easier said than done, but I think that it really helps improve the situation.  For example, say you disagree with something said in a meeting:<p><self-doubting inner voice>: &quot;Keep your mouth shut, you&#x27;re just going to look stupid!&quot;<p><self-affirming inner voice>: &quot;No! I may not know everything about this subject, but I know a lot, and they haven&#x27;t considered X!&quot;<p><out-loud>: &quot;I&#x27;m not an expert on this topic, but it seems to me that we might be overlooking X...<make your argument>...Does that make sense, or am I missing something?&quot;<p>As long as you&#x27;re careful not to come off as hostile (note that the &quot;out-loud&quot; part has a deliberately humble tone and invites further discussion if others disagree), the worst-case scenario is you get some free education from someone more experienced than you; best-case, you get some immediate, external validation that you <i>do</i> know what you&#x27;re doing.  In either case, you&#x27;re working towards breaking the habit of self doubt.<p>Anecdotally, I helped a friend get his first job in tech a couple of years back (he was previously a trash hauler), working as my assistant (I&#x27;m a DevOp) because I knew he&#x27;d be great at it if given the chance.  His impostor syndrome caused him to totally choke in the final interview (upper management actively didn&#x27;t want to hire him, but I managed to convince them that he&#x27;d be worth the low salary he was willing to take).  It took him over a year to begin to believe that he <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> an impostor, rather just new to the field. He worked hard, and followed my advice above, and his confidence gradually improved.  Today, he&#x27;s the Senior DevOps Engineer at that company (my old job), leading a team of 6, and making twice as much money as when he started.  If he decides he wants to move to a &quot;top&quot; company at this point, he should have no problem.<p>I guess my point is that impostor syndrome really sucks, but if you actively work at it, it gets better.<p>Also, based on your comments on this thread, you seem pretty cool to me.  If you&#x27;re interested, shoot me an email (in my profile), and I&#x27;ll gladly help you get an interview at my current company (Cloudera).",1453548775

10958014,comment,10955285,10956649,0,0,spangry,,,"I just read the PG essay and have to agree with the parent post. From what I can see, his argument boils down to this: increasing wealth concentration is caused by many things. Some of these things are &#x27;bad&#x27; (e.g. rent-seeking, bribing politicians) in and of themselves, and should be addressed. Some of these things are &#x27;good&#x27; (e.g. economic productivity varies from person to person, all other things equal), and it would be ill-advised to do away with these things by blindly optimising towards &#x27;less wealth inequality&#x27; (as it would make everyone worse off, in an absolute sense).<p>Obviously an oversimplification, as the essay also hints at a &#x27;undetermined&#x27; category. On this, the essay touches on two issues I&#x27;ve been thinking about for the past 5 years:<p>1) As capital (i.e. the means of production) becomes increasingly digital, it becomes cheaper to acquire and production can occur at a marginal cost of near 0 (e.g. it costs facebook virtually nothing when a person makes a new account). Cheaper to acquire means fewer people needed to pool money to attain capital. And marginal cost near 0 means more &#x27;winner-takes-all&#x27; markets (e.g. natural monopolies, network monopolies etc.). All this will result in more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.<p>2) Digital capital is highly mobile. AWS instances can be moved to another country almost instantaneously and without cost. This makes it hard for governments to tax returns to digital capital, barring some global tax agreement. So governments have very little scope for redistributing this increasingly concentrated wealth.<p>We badly need to have a public (and probably global) conversation along similar lines as PG&#x27;s essay: do we consider these good or bad things? are we ok with the resulting society? what should we do (if anything) about this?<p>Instead the conversation seems to be dominated by people who are fixated on remedying the symptoms, rather than the underlying disease(s). Supremely frustrating, and will eventually result in more extreme policy outcomes (i.e. expropriation vs. free-for-all).",1453547784

Just because it says end to end encryption and uses some nice ciphers it doesn&#x27;t mean the implementation is not critically flawed.<p>I use Signal right now (from Moxie Marlinspike/Whisper Systems) and would only really consider alternatives if they were endorsed by other cryptographers I know because I really just don&#x27;t have a strong enough grasp of how all the machinery interacts.",1453547304

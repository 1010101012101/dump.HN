The robotic vacuums market is still in its early stages. iRobot may be one of the first but they will definitely face some competition in the future. GE could easily acquire iRobot right now.<p>GE has thousands of products in a variety of industries. I'm sure they evaluated robotic vacuums and decided not to pursue it right away, for their own reasons. But they are still investing tons of capital in other areas. Big companies enter new markets all the time and you can't expect them to always get it right.<p><i>note</i> I agree with the person above, read Innovators Dilemma. Big companies are not the best at building disruptive technologies and lack of innovation is only a small factor.",1220028720

Stock market rises tend to be linked to technological advances. We are pretty close to some significant technological breakthroughs and these will only accelerate over the next 50 years.<p>Consider, for example, that within 15 years, it should be cheap and practical to use solar panels for almost everything. Consider robotics and the way robots will radicalize many industries as much as industrial robots have revolutionized factories, etc.",1220027764

290168,comment,289487,289700,0,0,bp001,,,"Agree dkokelly, and it also gets worse.<p>In your example, $5000/year interest is under the standard deduction.  Unless you already have other deductions to itemize, you are getting no tax write-off for the $5000.<p>For instance, in 2008, the standard deduction for singles is $5450.  Lets assume that you have $2000 in other itemized deductions.  So, the first $3450 of your mortgage interest simply offsets the write off you would get with the standard deduction.  Therefore, only $1550 would get you an additional deduction.<p>Now, if you're married, the standard deduction is $10900.  In my situation, my mortgage interest is just barely greater than that amount.",1220027347

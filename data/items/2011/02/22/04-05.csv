You only gave them a certain amount of energy, but if speeds were additive and you compared them then it would appear that their comparative speed was greater than the speed of light!<p>And that would imply an infinite amount of energy, which would be a problem.<p>Even if they were each traveling at 49% of the speed of light, so there are no issues of infinity, it takes a lot less energy to accelerate two object to 49% of the speed of light than it does to accelerate one to 98% of the speed of light (because it's a lot heavier when it's going that fast, so it contains far more energy), so you would have issues with conservation of energy.<p>Because of all that, speeds are not additive, and they get adjusted in a way that keeps conservation of energy exactly correct.<p>Therefor relativity is necessary if you want mass to be interchangeable with energy.",1298350652

It's not a big issue for me, though I'm completely disinterested in milk on its own. Most cheese is probably made with relatively unremarkable milk, though.<p>For cheese-making, I recommend starting with paneer / farmer's cheese, rather than aged cheeses. Gradually heat milk in a big pot, stir in a curdling agent (such as lemon juice), let it separate, then wrap the curds in cheesecloth and let them drip, maybe press them after. Real directions will be more specific (the book I linked has a great intro!), but that's the gist. Paneer is great fried with spinach and/or scrambled eggs. Also, try making bread with the whey.<p>Homemade yogurt is also good, particularly if you strain it a bit to thicken it (""labneh"", among many other names). Buttermilk is even easier, since it's less finicky about being kept warm, and it's fantastic for baking - soda bread with lots of rolled oats, pancakes, etc. Having a lot of large jars helps; I've accumulated a bunch of half-gallon (~2L) jars from honey used for meadmaking. They're incredibly versatile.<p>I really like _On Food and Cooking_ as a reference, though it doesn't inspire me the way _Wild Fermentation_ does. I also wholeheartedly recommend John Thorne's books, particularly  _Pot on the Fire_ and _Outlaw Cook_. The newsletter is good, too, if a bit sporadic these days.",1298350111

I spent hours complaining to the tech support, they insisted it did support it. Higher level tech would reveal the cablebox is running a version of MS Windows that only supports 2.0 sound over HDMI.

I think the jury is still out on whether OO is inherently a better form of programming in any other sense than approaches that are not built around objects.<p>There's plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest either way, but unfortunately true comparative research based on significant real world projects is always going to be hard to find. Most of us don't write industrial-scale code twice, and even if we did, we couldn't do it with the same team and starting from the same knowledge base in both cases.<p>I do find it interesting that as other non-trivial abstraction tools have become more widespread, the emphasis on using objects as the tool for every job seems to have diminished substantially, though. When all you've got is objects or plain old procedural code in otherwise much the same context, objects are a potentially useful extra tool in the box.

It's like trying to predict the motions of the stock market.<p>I have worked on airline pricing software, and have seen the dirty bowels where your airfare is cooked up.<p>The truth is that pricing rules are so complicated that occasionally even the people who are supposedly in charge of these things are not entirely able to predict or explain the prices.<p>Airline cabins are broken up into a dozen or more ""fare classes"", with a set number of seats available in each class. As you move towards the back, things get cheaper. As fare classes sell out, the prices for all fare classes on the flight will be moved up.<p>Travel between a particular pair of airports does have a base underlying fare, but so many special rules apply based on day of week, length of stay, holidays, and more that prediction is a lost cause.<p>If the airline suspects you are a business traveler, you will be charged much more. Round trips within a business week are tip-offs. Saturday night stays mark you as a leisure traveler.<p>If you are traveling on routes that the airline is trying to promote, or on which they are competing on fares with another airline, you may pay less.<p>If you wait until the last minute to purchase, you will almost certainly pay much more -- unless the flight is nearly empty (and the airline can figure this out), in which case you will not.<p>If part of your journey connects you through another airline, special rates apply.<p>If you are military, special rates apply.<p>All of these rules and many more go into a soup and the ""pricing engine"" is supposed to sort it all out. Afterwards, there may be significant debugging as the engineers try to explain why some fares have been applied.<p>When a competing airline surprises everyone by having extra-low fares, a sudden panic may set in, and new, ""high priority"" rules may be put into place to override the pricing engine to be competitive. These new rules may or may not stick around forever, where they complicate future pricing puzzles.<p>Then, of course, the actual tickets are sold through various online intermediaries, where pricing enters a whole new realm of negotiation, bulk sales, markdown and markup.<p>Hey, it's better than the 60's, when all this stuff happened on paper, and it wasn't until an hour before departure that the airline even knew how many people would show up at the door of the plane.<p>Southwest was one of the first to bust through this morass. One of the many reasons that Southwest kicked everyone's ass was their ability to set prices simply and predictably, and the fact that all of their tickets are sold direct to the customer with no intermediaries.",1298349681

In my opinion, the meditation practices are the main or major vehicle of yoga with the rest of the practices providing the necessary support to be able to attain a ""higher"" or ""deeper"" level of meditation.<p>That's not to say you can't focus on one part, and if you feel you're benefiting from just the postures, then more power to you and good luck.<p>My point isn't to say my definition of yoga is the correct view, but I think it's a shame that many people misunderstand yoga as being simply a form of physical postures.",1298348619

Using hybrid breeding techniques, corn has gone from an average of 40 bushels/acre to 180 bushels/acre in the past 60 years. And the bulk of that gain was simply from traditional breeding techniques - they've just barely cracked the door on using genetic data to make better/more informed seed selection and advancement. The industry is currently averaging a gain of 4 bushels/acre per year and that is only going to accelerate with the massive amount of money that is being plowed into marker analysis.<p>And it isn't going to stop with corn either. Big-Ag is expanding BIG into Asia, South America and to a lesser degree Africa and a lot of awesome work is being done on Rice, Canola, Sunflower and Sorghum. Those crops will be making some major gains in the next 10 years.<p>Don't let the Malthusians scare you, everything is going to be alright.",1298347312
2248666,comment,2247560,2248539,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"I work in healthcare and while I might be incorrect, this is my understanding of the situation.<p>Medicare is the largest payer of insurance claims by far. Medicare also has a lot of rules. One of these rules is that, in order to prevent providers from shortchanging Medicare, they have to charge everyone the same price (otherwise medicare would be overpaying....). Medicare will then pay 80% of the indicated amount and the rest is covered by medigap insurance, Medicaid, or by the patient.<p>As you might imagine, the lack of ability to price discriminate, even to patients, hugely distorts the market.\nHowever, private insurers have gotten around this (how I don't totally understand), by using what is called the contractually ""allowed amount"". This is an agreement that the provider will write off the variance between the allowed amount and the billed amount. This results in <i>de facto</i> price discrimination for large insurers while getting around the medicare law. Patient's don't have this kind of gig.<p>Of course, there are tons of other corruptions and inefficiencies in the system. I could tell you a story about a friend who once worked for NY Medicaid who was actively prevented from working to prevent the state from going bankrupt by paying claims.<p>I don't have the answers, but there is serious distortion of the market ATM.",1298347309

Pretty much every company we've spoken to has told us they're the best source of people, but they don't get enough of them.<p>Part of what makes them so good is that the person making the recommendation (i.e., the employee) knows both parties well. I think we have a good start to solving half this problem, since we're developing real relationships with the companies and being selective about whom we work with. The other half -- actually getting to know the people applying -- is probably the biggest challenge we face (next to meeting/finding people in the first place).",1298347276

Using something other than a /64 will break a number of IPv6 features such as neighbor discovery, secure neighbor discovery (SEND), privacy extensions, mobile IPv6, embedded-RP (multicast), etc.<p>The current IPv6 address assignment guidelines call for allocating a /64 only when it is known that one and only one subnet is needed, otherwise a /56 should be allocated to small sites that are ""expected to need only a few subnets over the next 5 years"", or a /48 for larger sites. (ARIN policy 6.5.4.1)<p>--- end quote ---<p>This is why all those just-bit-counting ""number of atoms in universe"" and ""79 octillion times"" comparisons are wrong. Actual comparison should compare single IPv4 address with something ranging from /64 to /48 IPv6 allocation - /64 is a minimum per L2 broadcast segment - so it's a minimum per-customer allocation (unless ISP is really greedy).

They're only ""stealing"" results from Google insofar as people (/Google employees) used Google in order to illustrate what pages they want returned given a certain search query. I have a sneaking suspicion that the exact same thing would have happened if they were in the position to do the same query bombing on Ask Jeeves or crappywebsearch.net as it did for Google.<p>Search engines to me are an obvious case of a means to an end. If a search engine better than Google were to come out tomorrow I would switch to it (from Google) instantly with no regrets. Google's sense of propriety about their results (or, more accurately, what users clicked on after searching via Google), especially given the fact that they are well-known for their penchant for sucking in user data like a black hole (not that I care-- I want them to use it if it means better searches), to me seems 9 parts hypocritical and 1 part prima donna.<p>Need people be reminded that this is the same company that ""accidentally"" logged users' WiFi browsing habits while driving StreetView cars around Europe?

a query and the fact that a user arrived at a URL by clicking on the spelling suggestion of the query – an important indication that the spelling suggestion is desired""<p>Some of the recent discussion has been about whether Microsoft looks at lots of different sites vs. doing something special or different for Google. This paper very much sounds like Microsoft reverse engineered which specific url parameters on Google corresponded to a spelling correction?

In other words, there's no blue pigment, its always blueish green or blueish purple.<p>This has been a challenge for pigment makers for centuries and has a complicated history.<p>Maybe sometimes a perfect pigment or dye is found, color wise, but then it turns out to easily fade, aka 'fugitive', so artists, the ones who expect their art work to last for more than a few years, are stuck with certain colors.<p>Why does this matter?  Its because of mixing.  You might think you have paints of the primaries, blue, yellow, and red, and you need a bright green, so you mix the blue with the yellow, and you end up with an muddy olive color.<p>Turns out your blue was leaning towards being purplish, and when mixed with the yellow, a component of grey was produced, because they are opposite.<p>So how do you get a nice bright green?  You need to mix a greenish blue with a greenish yellow.<p>In practice this results in artists, who want to paint with a full range of colors, need 6 primary colors.<p>For example, two good lightfast (not destroyed by light) blues are ultramarine (very old pigment), and a newer phthalo blue (much more modern).  The ultramarine leans towards the violet and the phthalo, to varying degrees, towards green.  In the old days I think prussian blue was the greenish blue of choice, but its a weak color and is easily overpowered.<p>Cobalt blue, if I'm not mistaken, is the closest thing we have to a lightfast primary color.<p>Artist really hit the jackpot with blues.  Some are very old.  They are also nicely transparent, which can make a difference in technique<p>The bright reds and bright yellows aren't so good, and the ones that are lightfast are supposed to be toxic.  And not very transparent either.<p>If you don't care about the brightness of your reds and yellows you are in luck, there are plenty of rust and dirt pigments like iron oxide, sienna and umber.<p>This is a complicated subject.  Here's a book about it<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yellow-Dont-Make-Green/dp/0967962870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yellow-Dont-Make-Green/dp/0967962...</a>",1296629060

2169238,comment,2168589,2169186,0,0,recoiledsnake,,,">I mean that the above comment seems to be suggesting that a company that reaches a certain level of success (e.g. Apple's user base) is in the wrong if it doesn't share that success on equal terms with any competitor that would like it. As if reaching that level of success were just a matter of chance and not, y'know...competition. That would be saying that your reward for creating a wildly successful product is to be held back from doing so again<p>All of what you wrote makes sense for a single market. But here things are different.
Apple makes phones. Amazon sells ebooks. The conflict of interest started when Apple started selling ebooks and now is ready to devalue it's phone to get leverage in the ebook space. i.e They're leveraging their smartphone marketshare to gather steam in the ebook space. Remind you of MS and Netscape? Pretty similar except for the Windows monopoly part.<p>Didn't exactly that happen with Microsoft with Windows and Office?<p>>your reward for creating a wildly successful product is to be held back from doing so again<p>Err, how would Apple be held back from creating a killer ebook app and succeeding by the merits of it rather than sitting around and charging a tax on all the ebook purchases on iDevices? How does this benefit the user?<p>So you mean creating a successful product by beating competition in one market should allow one to automatically make another successful product in another by riding roughshod over the competition leveraging the earlier success beyond just using the profit as capital?<p>So, do you think Microsoft shouldn't have been punished for bundling IE(it was actually better than Netscape at that point) with Windows ? They didn't even ban Netscape or attempt to tax it, they just bundled their browser with a very successful OS which is not a matter of chance but, y'know...competition.",1296626531

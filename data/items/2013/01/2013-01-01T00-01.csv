Is there evidence for that?<p>>  6 year old girls don't scream out your product name, get a grip.<p>I think you're misinterpreting my tone, because I'm just pointing out that your comment was full of ungrounded conjecture. It doesn't bother me personally, since I have over 400,000 reasons not to worry what somebody on the internet says about Freckle as a business.<p>What does bug me is the unquestioning perpetuation of the myth that developers don't pay for things, which is a truthy ""fact"" that scares people away from serving a varied, diverse, and incredibly valuable market who needs things.",1357001802

4991502,comment,4991114,4991114,1,0,Mz,,,"I think it depends a lot on context. I used to participate in a free forum. The founder was brilliant at choking off all possible avenues of monetization while bitching endlessly about wanting to make money (edit: mostly to help cover costs, not necessarily profit per se in his case). He did not want to ask for donations and he also did not want to commercialize it. However it was quite popular and outgrowing its hosting solution, which led to lots of complaints of slowness due to traffic load. I thought he should have posted a notice saying ""The site is slow because we need to upgrade from x server costing x amount of money per month to y server costing y amount of money per month. When I get enough donations to cover y for a year in advance, I will happily upgrade. Until then, quit your bitchin."" Then any time someone complained, link to the notice (with donate button, naturally) and tell them ""Put up or shut up"". Similar to the webcomic author whose audience was whining he wasn't updating enough and he said ""I make x amount at my day job. Match that."" Much to his shock, he had $4000.00 in an hour. He said it to say ""shut the fuck up"". Instead, he ended up quitting his job and doing the comic full time.<p>So where do you have demand? Find some way to charge for it. That's what I am trying to say. List your assets, list where you have demand, list different ways that might get monetized. Tie pay to what people want from you.<p>Best of luck.",1357001545

There's no special metaphysical basis for a knowledge of god, despite your stupid rationalisations.<p>And we don't ""hate God"" here - we don't hate any of the imaginary deities invented throughout human history. All of those ideas played an important role in early human culture, even if they are now all firmly past their best by date. Anyway, how can you hate something that doesn't exist? Your claim that we hate your god makes as much sense to us as a Hindu telling you that you hate Ganeesh and Shiva would to you. You would make similar arguments to a Hindu as to why their silly superstition is false, while preserving your own superstition from the same equally-valid critique. We simply observe the most logical and efficient explanation of the many competing ancient superstitions and surmise that they are all equally ungrounded in reality.<p>We are simply irritated by people who refuse to quit clinging to ancient, irrelevant superstitions, refuse to accept the cutting edge of human knowledge, refuse to accept and take charge of our position in the universe and advance the human story, refuse to accept our true ignorance of the nature of the universe (implicit in claiming that ~3000 year old ideas made up by people orders of magnitude more ignorant than us still have any relevance or signal any absolute truth) - and worst of all refuse to keep their irrelevant ignorance in their pants and instead run around trying to criticise intelligent, enlightened, superstition-free people.",1357001527

4991477,comment,4990950,4991200,3,0,objclxt,,,"><i>""porn is one of the few ""safe"" ways for young people to figure their junk out""</i><p>I disagree with this. By virtue of the market, most porn online is targeted towards men. The majority of pornography thus fulfils masculine desires, which is not necessarily what women want.<p>One Swedish study (abstract here[1], but you can find the stats I use cited elsewhere in full) of 4,000 high school students found that a much larger proportion of girls described pornography as ""sexually off-putting"" (it is worth noting that Sweden has an extremely progressive sex education policy in its schools). Pornography re-enforces masculine stereotypes - someone viewing pornography at a young age may take that to be 'how it is done', rather than illustrating a fantasy.<p>Now that doesn't mean there <i>isn't</i> healthy pornography: as other people have pointed out, there's something for everyone when it comes to porn online. But a 13 year old boy (or girl) looking for porn is almost certainly going to start at the lowest common denominator, and that's porn that's often denigrating to women at best.<p>Before I'm flamed into oblivion, I am not against pornography: I am merely suggesting that typical porn - the kind that you may run across as a teenager, on the more accessible sites - is not ""one of the few 'safe' ways for young people to figure their junk out"".<p>This is why I think if you are a parent it is important not to ban, or discourage, your children from watching pornography, but to make sure they understand that porn fundamentally is about fulfilling fantasies, and is not always an accurate portrayal of reality. Those first encountering porn may not necessarily be aware of that.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001387"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110...</a>",1357000888

This usually means the ability to dig into library source code, use debugging tools effectively, and be able to wrap your head around the ""magic"" rather than just treating it like an unbreachable black box.<p>* Comprehensive understanding the various Rails pieces and how they fit together (activesupport, activemodel, actionpack, and the sub-pieces within; the router and asset pipeline, and the Rack middleware nature of a Rails application)<p>* Comprehensive understanding of the <i>hows</i> and <i>whys</i> of testing, deep familiarity with at least one of the common testing frameworks (testunit, minitest, rspec), and an understanding of how to develop features and bugfixes via test-first methodology.<p>* Comprehensive understanding of deploying a Rails app, and the care and feeding of a production application. Multi-server scaling, zero-downtime deploys, and redundancy/failover plans are a big bonus.<p>* Rock-solid understanding of Ruby, particularly as it pertains to metaprogramming.<p>* The ability to evaluate third-party gems, both from a functionality and code perspective, and determine their appropriateness as a solution to a given problem.<p>* Good command of at least one major source control system. If you're using git, you should know how to use topic branches, rebase branches, perform merges, recover lost work, that sort of thing.<p>Basically, I'd call someone a ""senior"" dev if they tend to answer more questions than they have to ask.

Our company [<a href=""http://theory11.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theory11.com</a>] is a collective of artists in the magic industry, but Apollo's expertise extends much further, to applications in law enforcement and military intelligence.<p>Apollo practices not only pickpocketing, but also putpocketing, where he plants an object on the spectator (in their pocket, etc). Their reaction, upon reaching into their pocket to discover a random, rubber shrimp, is pretty funny.<p>Interesting to note is that when Apollo is doing a stage performance, the audience often KNOWS he is a pickpocket. The participant on stage KNOWS he is going to try to steal something. But the more they consciously try to prevent it, the easier he can divert their attention right where he wants.<p>Most impressive about Apollo isn't what he does, though - it's how he does it, and how deep his understanding is of why it works. If you're interested in that sort of thing, definitely check out the book Sleights of Mind (featuring Apollo's insight on the neuroscience of magic) and the television special Brain Games, with Apollo and David Copperfield.

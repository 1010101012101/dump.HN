436207,comment,436053,436053,0,0,natch,,,"One patent is not likely to be worth much. If you can put together a small cluster of them, it's much more compelling for an investor/buyer. Depends on what kind of patent, though.<p>'course, this isn't the best time to bet on getting funding, patents or not. Probably better to focus on finding an actual revenue stream.<p>And have you really done a diligent search for both existing patents, and prior art? Don't rely on your lawyer to do this; he/she has a financial disincentive to do anything that would discourage you from attempting to file a patent (I used the word ""attempting"" for a reason: your lawyer probably has things set up so that even a mere attempt will result in fees, whether that attempt is successful or not).<p>Also know that some patent lawyers file patents just to get the money for filing them. Read carefully, this point is distinct from the one in the previous paragraph. The fact that a patent is filed and eventually granted, does not mean it is a valuable patent. Your lawyer's job is generally not to judge the technical or business merit of the patent, unless you have specifically set up your relationship with him/her to provide an incentive for that. So be aware that your patent might prove to be worthless. While even a worthless patent will grease the skids with some investors, at least go into this with your eyes wide open.",1232084553

436200,comment,435306,435306,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"My start-up is all about comments.  I've spent months thinking about how to go about commenting... and I still haven't cracked it yet, but let me just spill my thoughts on the matter.<p>Threaded/Linear have their pros and cons.<p>To have threaded comments, it means you are limiting the user to explicitly reply to one comment.  As an aside, it's possible to make one comment be a reply to many, and then creating some really neat conversation graph out of it, but that's just so complicated.  I think we can all agree that threading is the ability to reply to one comment, and create a tree structure of comments.<p>Threaded comments create a tree of conversation; it's highly structured.  Nearly as important as your post is where in the thread it goes.  You lose the option to post something more general, or something that references several other posts.  The importance in threaded conversations is the structure and not chronology.<p>Linear comments is all about chronology.  The conversation evolves over time, and you lose the structure.  It's flat.  If you want to reply to someone, you're just quoting then.  By the way, a linear commenting system without quoting, in my opinion, is the lowest form of commenting.  It almost angers me to see it being used, anywhere.<p>Nearly all forums use non-threaded, and it seems to work out great!  It's more of a community builder -- let's all join this conversation as it passes through time.<p>Threaded conversations have the problem of becoming highly specific very quickly.  But, they allow the structure to be clearly visible.  Also, threaded conversations don't allow you to dig for what you want as easily.  You'll never be able to order a tree-like structure in any meaningful way unless you flatten it.<p>The conclusion I ultimately reached was always use threaded, because if you're smart about it, threaded implies linear as well.  You can always flatten a tree -- the data is there.  But it's much harder to take a linear set of comments and imply which is a child of which based on quoted text.  In short, you can go from threaded to non-threaded, but not vice versa.<p>So, I allow my users to view the conversation as a thread, with very smooth features, like instantly sorting children of any post by Date, Username, or Score.  And, coming soon, I'm going to allow a non-threaded view.  It will just flatten the tree and show posts, in any order they choose, date, score, username, etc.  If the post is a ""reply"" then I just annote: ""In reply to [link]summary of replied post[/link]""<p>One major issue with threading is scalability.  What happens when you have 500 comments in one giant tree?  Which do you show?  How do you prune the tree?  Do you show that gem of a comment that has a depth of 8?  Do you hide it's siblings or parents?  It really becomes a lot of trouble... and the solution seems to be: ""ajax it in.""<p>-sam",1232084397

A program can not.</i><p>So, if an artificial information-sensing/learning program is not as strong at sensing information as the strongest information-sensing/learning machine that has ever existed - the human brain - then it cannot sense and learn information at any level? Wouldn't that be a strawman argument?<p>You seem to be claiming that if artificial intelligence does not exist at a human level, that it therefore does not exist at <i>any</i> level. Why are you arbitrarily selecting human-level general intelligence as the only intelligence that could possibly exist? Your line of reasoning seems to imply that human olfactory nodes (sub-processors which help humans sense, and learn, smells) do not represent any level of intelligence at all, since they are not at the level of current human general-intelligence.<p>Is a single-celled protozoan (e.g. ameba) intelligent?

436195,comment,435972,435972,0,0,jfischer,,,"This and the two linked articles really changed my perceptions about airline disasters. People tend to think that the safety lecture at the beginning of a flight is pointless, as you can't survive anyway. However, the article states that 80% of airplane accidents occur during takeoff or landing and most of these are survivable. Also, survival is not just a matter of luck, but often depends on your individual response to the situation. Most people tend to freeze up (not panic) in a crisis situation. If you know the emergency procedures and think in advance about what to do, you are more likely to overcome this instinct and act decisively.",1232083674

Sadly, I cannot claim to have come up with it, and I don't know who did.<p>Instead of working with [a] lists, work with [a] -> [a] prepender functions. So the analogue of [1, 2, 3] is f: \x -> [1 2 3] ++ x. Then the analogue of the append of f and 4 is f . (\x -> [4] ++ x), where the . represents composition.

Do you realize that to serve the cow recognition market, we simply clip RFID tags to their ears? <a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=cow+ear+rfid+tag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=cow+ear+rfid+tag</a><p>The artificial-machine face-recognition market is fueling the development of special intelligence in that area. There is relatively quick-return money in that area, so that is an area where intelligence is being developed first. Smell-recognition is another area where development of special intelligence can pay off relatively quickly, and therefore is providing impetus for development. So far, there are at least these relatively-fast-payoff markets for which special intelligences are being developed:<p><pre><code>  1. face recognition
  2. smell recognition

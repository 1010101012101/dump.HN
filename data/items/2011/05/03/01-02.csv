The client side work scales relatively linearly across this axis for native code, but tends to rise exponentially for a web app.<p>He actually said that couldn't really think of any good examples of a ""delightful experience"" in a web app, particularly on mobile. He cited the example of one of the top web companies on the planet working for years to build what is arguably a worse word processor than the ""hello world"" example code included in most native platform SDKs.<p>Another issue is that once you start really trying to nail the user experience on each platform, most of the cross-platform nature of a mobile web app goes away. Sure, you can use something like PastryKit to make a web app that acts just like a native iPhone app, but then you end up with a very un-Android-like app when using it on Android.<p>Something like JQuery Mobile is a great way to get a usable product to market on multiple platforms quickly, but ultimately not everything that could be just a web app should be just a web app.",1304386083

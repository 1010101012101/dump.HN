In fact, I even think most people who I know that read significantly faster than me do so this way.  The strange part is that when asked, people have told me that they have a hard time deciding whether they read a word a time or in larger blocks of text.  My only question would be: can this skill be learned/trained? If so, how does one go about doing that?<p>I'm a bit ambivalent about the bottleneck, at least personally. I guess it depends on what kind of reading you do most of the time, but I'm inclined that I read more materials that are written in simple text that was meant to be consumed easily and that in those cases the bottleneck is in the text->parse stage.  When reading technical material (which I also spend a fair amount of time doing) the bottleneck is definitely on the parse->meaning stage and that process probably takes several orders of magnitude more time, but speeding up the text->parse stage would be worth its while still.  I say this because the process is a little bit different when reading technical material.  You get through the text and you think about it for a long time, do problems, discuss, perform thought experiments, etc. But everything in the list seems to be a different stage than the parse->meaning stage. It is more of a meaning->true understanding/intuition stage. Something like first you read and you need to comprehend what you have been told at a ""language"" level. Then you go and understand the concepts more abstractly and at different levels. However, it is difficult to draw the line between those two stages.",1207547685

156701,comment,156464,156615,0,0,rguzman,,,"I go back and forth between trying to read between the two styles. It mostly has to do with whether I'm trying to read to ""savor the language"" or to gather information. I'm definitely not willing to skim through Howl, but if I get the point on a textbook without having to read every word in a paragraph that's awesome.",1207546258

156699,comment,156621,156621,0,0,lux,,,"Wow, this is awesome!  Many CS grads I've worked with before had little experience of any web technologies or concepts coming out of school, which makes it that much harder to get them up to speed.  I quickly realized I can't take for granted that someone would know source code version control, or understand protocols like HTTP and POP3 or how to telnet into them for debugging.  Definitely bookmarking this for future use!",1207546082
156698,comment,156464,156674,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"I think the comprehension remains just fine. I use a desktop version of zapreader (now obsolete as far as I'm concerned, I like web apps much better), and I comfortably read at 800wpm without any comprehension issues. The brain caches words as they're flashed to your eyes, and you only have 2% of ""real"" (narrow) vision anyway, so from a psychological viewpoint it makes sense. That's also why zapreader has a pause button. The nice thing about my desktop reader (which I admit I don't use a lot, hence I'll switch) is you can pause it and show the context, which lets you think for a while if you want to.",1207546063

156695,comment,156464,156577,0,0,rguzman,,,"The reason to find shortcuts is that there is a vast amount of information out there and limited amounts of time you can devote to learn it.<p>I am not trying to do it less carefully, I would like to do it more efficiently.  To put in perspective: I know people (mostly English PhD students) who read 2x or maybe even 4x as fast as I do AND retain and understand what they read better than me.  Of course, this doesn't apply to them trying to read SICP, but it does when reading Virginia Woolf. Specialization and practice have something to do with it; but, the point remains that there is something to be gained by making the process of information intake as efficient as it can be.",1207545969

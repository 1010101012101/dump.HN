The only thing society can really offer doctors is independence and respect. That&#x27;s why -- for the longest time in this country -- doctors often owned and ran their own practices. That&#x27;s why we addressed doctors with the honorific &quot;Doctor.&quot; But the first is all but dead in this country and the second, because of some kind of unwashed, egalitarian ethic that only gets worse and worse, is starting to die out too.<p>We&#x27;ve really fucked up, as a society. No one in his or her right mind is going to want to spend life kow-towing to pervasive regulations and third-party bureaucrats second guessing them and tying their hands, while rushing to and fro like a retail clerk in an understaffed big box store, and all the while having to protect the egos of patients by introducing oneself as Bob or Sally.<p>Doctors need prestige and independence.

The average adult has how many &quot;friends&quot; and how many of those are spouses of other friends and friends of family? I think that even if we there was zero racism people would still tend towards marrying those similar to ourselves. On a back of the napkin calculation this means any group might have less friends of other groups based on the overwhelming influence of family and friends of siblings and such alone. I think we have to look deeper than this stat.",1409487693

I am a congenitally blind  person who can (occasionally) find a way to make myself see a tiny bit better, and a lot of what I do is allow my eyes to wander up and down different surfaces. I basically pretend that they are fingertips. I am much less good at the other types of vision, but I&#x27;ve played around with them a bit; it&#x27;s like I am hurling my body through space. I can&#x27;t access the New Yorker article but I suspect my experience is different because I have always felt sighted even though I&#x27;ve never had vision. I really suck at being a blind person and thus am incredibly motivated to figure out how sight works, because I can already tell that I&#x27;m a visual learner (and an artist) and sight makes so much intrinsic sense to me.",1409487670

There are many ways to provide military aid, not all of them involving your own troops; and with the rise of a strongly anti-Russian EU Commission, I bet all these options will be considered sooner rather than later. At the end of the day, it took <i>years</i> for NATO to intervene in Yugoslavia, a situation far less problematic than Ukraine (from the point of view of Russian engagement); but then they did intervene, <i>twice</i>.<p>In the grand scheme of things, EU defense relies immensely on US forces and there are no signs that this is going to change anytime soon. The UK is struggling to just maintain capability, let alone expand it to replace allied resources. The French are now 100% integrated in NATO and have enough on their plate by caring for their African ex-colonies anyway. Italy and Spain can&#x27;t pay state pensions, let alone expanding their military. The only country with some spare capacity would be Germany, which cannot do it for historical and political reasons.<p>In fact, what the Ukraine crisis is showing is how Europe still cannot say no to the US in security matters: it was the US administration that pushed for escalating Maidan (remember &quot;fuck the EU&quot;?), it was the US administration that pushed for sanctions (with Europeans going along grudgingly) and it&#x27;s the closest US allies (UK, Poland) who are now leading the charge for further escalation... and finding no formal opposition, despite plenty of grumbling across the continent. Because in practice, nobody can afford to lose their US umbrella.",1409487402

Just apply the time evolution operator.<p>But wouldn&#x27;t the regular measurement cause a collapse onto a randomly-chosen eigenstate of the measured operator? That is, if we have a PRNG based on a regularly measuring the lava lamp, then to predict the state after N steps, we not only have the issue of the randomly chosen N-th measurement but also have to take into account the random results of the N-1 previous measurements, which can potentially evolve into entirely new directions.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s difficult to place a lava lamp over human time scales, as both are far from the usual quantum/classical limits: We know that even in thousands of years’ time, Earth will still revolve mostly deterministically (in the classical sense) around the sun. Similarly, electrons will hardly ever behave deterministically. Lava lamps and a couple of years are oddly in between.",1409486833

127914,comment,127675,127900,0,0,bobp,,,"I guess it depends on your definition of risk. The definition I was going by is the chance of getting a decent payout after spending 4 years of your life working somewhere. If you work for someone else's startup, especially for a tiny amount of equity, you risk forgoing the opportunity to enjoy the financial benefits of a successful exit after 4 years of hard work.<p>A founder can also get a job in 10 minutes if the startup flops. The additional <i>sacrifice</i> (not necessarily risk) the founders take is living a few months without salary. This sacrifice obviously merits a higher portion of the equity than an employee -- maybe even much higher -- but as an employee you have to wonder whether the tiny equity you'll get is worth it.",1204531096
127913,comment,127751,127910,0,0,rms,,,"I think the distinction here is that the YC partners are investing their own money and the VC are funded mainly by limited partners. In the case of Sequoia, Harvard is a huge limited partner. Though I heard there was a dispute between them because Harvard only wanted to invest in Sequoia's US branch and not the foreign ones. I'm not sure how it was resolved.",1204531039
127912,comment,127675,127675,0,0,Spyckie,,,"For your situation - you are, ultimately, selling yourself not just as an employee but as a package of value contributed to the company. Now, if you are valuable - that means, if you can provide experience, work or code to the company that will drive it forward that not many other people can provide, then yes, you should consider asking for more equity.<p>Really, its all about selling. You have some goods or services. They want/need it. Is the current deal fair in both parties' eyes? Founders will say all sorts of things like ""I bear all the risk"", ""I've been here since the beginning"", and ""I've contributed the most work"", and many of these things will be true. However, you have cards to play like, ""employees need compensation for their efforts"", ""good hackers are rare"" and ""I can add value to your company"" (we assume you can). There's an argument to be had here about how much employee should get, but really, its all about how you negotiate. You have to show them why you think the deal is unfair to you, and offer up one that you think is more fair to both parties. If you like the deal, just take it. If you don't like the deal enough to take it, offer up your own, and if they reject it, you weren't going to take the original deal anyways.<p>But I will admit that like everyone else here has said, the negotiation here is skewed heavily towards the founders favor - still try to get what you can.",1204530925

There are medical technologies growing constantly and while it does involve a little more initial investment some of these areas approach ""startup"" levels of innovation and risk.<p>I'd suggest there may be more variety on the ""healthcare"" side the real estate.",1204530707

127901,comment,127675,127675,0,0,secorp,,,"Startup pros:<p>* great people, unique culture<p>* influence a wide range of issues from tech to office location<p>* great experience for founding a company later<p>Note that I didn't include ""huge potential financial gain"" in that list. A non-founder at a startup really has to value the experience because most likely there won't be a huge financial win. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to negotiate a fair compensation package, but really you are using the opportunity to gain skills and experience to use when founding your own company where you will have more ownership and potential financial gain. If you don't believe that the founders take more risk than the employees now, you will once you found your own company :)<p>If financial gain is your main goal, you may want to take a serious look at getting into the financing side. This will take a different approach, but good analytical skills plus good networking skills are in high demand. Alternatively, you could go down a more corporate path and aim for senior management at a good firm. I'm not necessarily recommending these paths, but it's worth exploring the alternatives so that you can really appreciate the (in my opinion) extraordinary benefits and privileges of working at a startup.",1204528871
127900,comment,127675,127675,0,0,webwright,,,"""working at a startup is riskier for employees than for founders.""<p>That (honestly) is ridiculous.  If the founder is taking the standard path, they are going months or years without salaries, oftentimes accumulating debt to do so.  When they get a little slice of angel funding, they usually pay themselves pennies so their early hires can get non-insulting salaries.<p>You seem to assume that a ""cash-out"" is a foregone conclusion.  99% of startups go belly up.  No payout for the founders, ""modest"" or otherwise.<p>A fraction of a percent for an engineer is not uncommon.  I'd need to know the company size, how far along they are, what sort of salary they are offering, and how senior YOU are to know if it's unreasonable.  But for a funded startup offering a non-insulting salary to a relatively junior person, it's common.  And (honestly) plenty fair.<p>What, exactly, are YOU risking as an employee?  The 10 minutes it'll take you to go find a new job if the startup flops?  Do you know what the founders have on the table?  If not, you could probably ask them.<p>If you want more equity, offer to work for free or ridiculously cheap.  Many smart founders will happily trade a little more equity to avoid a monster salary.",1204528633

127897,comment,127675,127675,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Working at a startup is not more risky for employees than for founders.<p>Consider that the startup you are applying to already has funding (I'm assuming it does, since it sounds like there is already a team).  The founders started with nothing but an idea, probably invested their free time to implement v0 and then sold it well enough to attract funding.  They could have failed at any time, and would have had nothing except experience and pissed off investors to show for it, not to mention the loss of any personal investment in the firm.<p>You on the other hand will draw a salary from day 1, and you already have a better idea of the company's trajectory than the founders did when they conceived of the idea.  Even if the company goes under, you will have earned $X in addition  to the experience gained.<p>And you have the luxury of not having to worry about how to get funding, sign deals, etc.<p>If you don't like the risk/reward, the best way to change the equation is to become a founder, or build/lead something so amazing that your rep alone compels startups to offer you a significant percentage.",1204528032

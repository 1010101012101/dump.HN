759076,comment,757843,757843,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"""When Paris hosted the Exposition Universelle in 1900, it unveiled its vision for the future of transport. The trottoir roulant was a moving walkway that circled the fair in a 3-kilometre loop, its articulated wooden segments ""gliding around like a wooden serpent with its tail in its mouth"", according to one reporter.<p>Chicago's walkway, the brainchild of engineer Max Schmidt, consisted of three rings, the first stationary, the second moving at 4 kilometres per hour and the third at 8 km/h, an arrangement that allowed walkers to adjust to each speed before moving to the next.<p>In fact, the idea of high-speed walkways had been established in New York longer than anywhere else. Back in 1871, local wine merchant Alfred Speer patented the first ""endless-travelling sidewalk"", and promptly proposed an ambitious elevated moving walkway along Broadway. It would have zipped pedestrians along at up to 30 km/h<p>Undaunted, Schmidt proposed a flurry of similar projects around Manhattan - running down Broadway, along Wall Street, over the Williamsburg Bridge and across 23rd and 34th Street. To Schmidt, the advantages of the moving walkway were so compelling that he was convinced they would supplant some subways rather than supplement them. By 1909, he was pushing a massive $70 million scheme that would provide Manhattan with a network of subterranean moving sidewalks.""<p>- <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327200.200-how-the-moving-walkway-nearly-overtook-the-metro.html?full=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327200.200-how-the-m...</a>",1250106817

759069,comment,758458,758946,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"While I'm not claiming to speak for all library employees, I worked for a public library for about six years* , including some time when wireless internet access was relatively novel. Someone camping out with a laptop wasn't a problem, even all day, provided they weren't being noisy (cell phones!), downloading porn, or otherwise being a nuisance. Actually, people who bring their own computers are probably a lot <i>less</i> trouble for staff, who may be busy keeping of track of whose turn it is next on the public computers, helping adults figure out how to file taxes online, etc.<p>The staff (and/or branch policy) ultimately decide what to do if a group of people is obviously using the library as a kind of temporary office, and they may request you make more formal arrangements. (The branches I worked at always had back rooms that could be rented out to tutors.) With several people, noise may be an issue. Still, one person typing, or two or three people working with occasional quiet collaboration is probably on par with a couple teenagers studying together. Just be considerate.<p>Libraries are paid for with tax dollars, and (as tptacek noted) staff are generally more nervous about empty libraries. Branch funding is often closely tied to usage stats - people coming through the door each day, circulation, internet station sessions, etc.<p>Also, depending on the neighborhood, the staff are probably more worried about drunk and/or mentally ill street people, misbehaving teenagers, etc. (Oh, the stories...)<p>* Great job to have through college, BTW.",1250106697

759066,comment,758840,758995,0,0,warfangle,,,"Are you serious?<p>""They're the most data rich and accessible""<p>Visual design aside, there's a distinct possibility that DC.gov is one of the most data rich government sites out there. The only problem is, well, finding the information. The findability level of this information is about like the hand-curated Yahoo! Directory from 1999.<p>And then there's accessibility. Maybe that means something different to you than me, but let's delve into it.<p>First of all, the page uses tables. That makes it a nightmare for any screen-reading software to utilize.<p>Turning off styles and javascript renders the main navigation useless.<p>The markup of the page is entirely table cells and font tags, granting no semantic meaning to the content whatsoever. This makes deep-searching the site even more problematic, as search engines have no context for the textual information contained within the page. E.g.; Google looks at h1 elements as having more important content than, say, a p element. It also limits the usefulness of screenreaders, as they read cell by cell, row by row. (thus, if two related pieces of content are in two cells, one on top of each other, they won't be read together - it will read the first one, then finish up the row before continuing on with the second cell).<p>Then there's deep-link URLs like, <a href=""http://www.rrc.dc.gov/rrc/cwp/view,a,1182,q,447149,rrcNav_GID,1417,.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rrc.dc.gov/rrc/cwp/view,a,1182,q,447149,rrcNav_GI...</a>. What does that even mean? Is it some attempt at securing the ""Play in DC"" page (which, to be honest, is fairly useless: all it does is list links to the history, entertainment, libraries, etc subpages.. the only reason it's needed is because the entire site design is one big Charlie Foxtrot).<p>Anyone who thinks this website is a ""pretty good job"" and has anything to do with: design, usability, accessibility, and SEO - well, you should probably turn in your card. Sorry to say. And if a C-level executive doesn't understand how -- especially with government sites -- accessibility for visually impaired individuals is extremely important, well. He either needs to be educated or, if ineffective, fired. It's nearly criminal (especially for a government website).<p>In finality:<p>Being a data rich site means nothing if accessing that data is akin to crawling through a swimming pool filled with broken glass and lemon juice. And then not even getting the information you were looking for when you first dove into the miasma of pain.",1250106630

759055,comment,758404,758795,0,0,Poiesis,,,"I work for a defense contractor, so I have some experience here.  There are at least two obstacles to making good looking software/sites paid for by the government:<p>1. Nobody wants to pay for ""Looks pretty.""  You have a list of requirements to satisfy.  Each feature costs a certain amount of money.  If it comes down to a feature or a pretty UI, it's going to be pretty hard to justify to someone that you spend money making it look good when it otherwise works perfectly well.<p>2. ""Looks pretty"" is a testable requirement.  Sure, you can have focus groups say what they like (but that costs money, see #1), and you can have requirements like ""no functionality shall be more than 2 mouse clicks away from the main screen""--but then you get a screen with 300 buttons on it.  There are heuristics you can use to do good design, sure--but there's very few ways to create general, testable requirements that reflect good design.<p>3. Sometimes there's the problem that the entity paying for the software is not the entity using the software.  To clarify: this situation is usually the case, it's just that sometimes the people with the money care about the users, and sometimes they don't or have their own agenda.",1250106457

You seem to be pushing this false dichotomy where either we have nigh-omniscience about the climate and can do geoengineering, or we know nothing about the climate and can't be justified in reducing CO2 emissions. That's wrong-headed in multiple ways.<p>Suppose we have 10% credence that SO2 injections will cause catastrophic side effects on the long-term human habitability of the earth. (Rephrased: we have 90% credence that SO2 injections will <i>not</i> cause a catastrophic side effect). In this case it would be absolutely reckless to do SO2 injections, because 10% of catastrophic is too high of an expected risk. That's a risk profile on the same order of magnitude as Russian roulette.<p>But if we only have 10% credence that continued, unrestricted net CO2 emissions will cause catastrophic side effects on the long-term human habitability of the earth, it would be absolutely reckless to continue doing so, for the exact same reason.<p>The fact that we don't have an exceptionally accurate model of climate is the exact reason that we should err on the side of caution. We have an accurate model of a single aspect of climate--the greenhouse effect--and can make some rough projections otherwise, but the climate is inherently a chaotic system, which makes any exact predictions (for instance, any predictions with the necessary confidence required to do geoengineering) impossible. So we're never even going to reach 90% confidence that geoengineering is safe. My personal estimate is around 90% confidence that continued carbon emissions are unsafe, but I am pretty damn sure that confidence level is above 50%.",1250104950

We've actually thought a bit about adding phone-based triggering to PagerDuty (via a 1-800 number + access code).

IMO this would either need to be built onto existing subway infrastructure where access to the system for repairs will be relatively easy . . . or do the cheap-easy way of just build it above ground.<p>I mean most large cities are getting expanding amounts of skyway (the enclosed walkways between buildings), once this gets to sufficient scale it would be no extra effort to attach pre-fabed tunnels to the bottom of the skyway networks. It's currently part of the Calgary by-law that all new buildings have to be connected to their skyway system.<p>The mass installation of new infrastructure is absurd considering the amount of work it requires below-ground, however above-ground would be exceptionally simple with a well developed skyway system. There's very little point of implementing this system without making it <i>big</i>, so until its exceptionally cheap per mile to install it will never happen, because our cities are simply way too big for a project like this if it's costly per mile.",1250103916

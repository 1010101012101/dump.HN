He is definitely not a rails partisan, and much prefers scala to ruby as a language, but his conclusion was that while play has a solid core and does many things right (including some things better than rails), it comes up short on convenience and utility functions, templating, and ecosystem.<p>I think the ecosystem in particular is an area where rails magic makes it possible for the community to create very powerful gems that just work, and is probably where the most time is saved vs. other frameworks that have more of an explicit bent. I understand the skepticism towards the implicit approach--it has certainly bitten me before, and I try to minimize magic in my own rails code wherever possible--but again, if you're optimizing for productivity, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff.<p>Take devise as an example. Despite using all kinds of implicit and convoluted magic underneath, it can save huge amounts of time, especially early in a project, and is well tested and proven in the community. I'm not aware of a lib in any other framework that can handle so many boring authentication issues (sessions, roles, encryption, email confirmation, lockouts, remember me, forgot password flow, session expiration, redirect flows, etc. etc.) with such minimal code and configuration.<p>Sorry if I put words in your mouth.

When I turned 18, I promptly had breast reduction surgery...yeah, they were that big, and I am very small-framed...yeah, there were good health reasons to do the surgery, but mainly my psyche was fucking bruised from having so much unwanted and often mean-spirited attention directed at my breasts. All through college, if I heard a group of guys laughing as I walked past, I'd get really self conscious and think they were probably looking at me and laughing about some aspect of my appearance...even though I'd had that surgery and now nothing much really stood out about me. I tell this little story because you have to understand...when you get hit on, teased, picked on, bullied, all throughout your adolescence, just because you're female, the snickering whispered laughter--and sexual jokes--of guys can make you feel very very uncomfortable and bad.<p>I have no idea if this is something like what happened to Adria Richards, but it sounds like it.

It's a response that, relatively speaking, is a ""punishment"" that was disproportionate to the offense. It's a little hypocritical as it shows little consideration for the various people in the photograph both ""innocent"" and ""guilty"". For example, someone in the picture may have a stalker. Showing up in the background of some random pictures at PyCon would be a bit risky, but largely acceptable. Appearing in the foreground of a picture of picture tweeted on a popular stream and discussed widely is much more risky. In some cases such a response may be appropriate, from everything Adria said in her post it seems a relatively disproportionate response.<p><i></i>More<i></i> importantly though, she didn't give a chance for the proper mechanisms to work...it spoils the victory. This could have been an issue of everything working as it should but now, while the outcome at PyCon (the inappropriateness was stopped) was good...it's slightly hollow.<p>The other disturbing thing is there is a small degree of hypocrisy and bad faith in Adrias original post. The focus on women as opposed to creating an appropriate environment for EVERYONE is a little disappointed. As noted elsewhere in general terms women are absolutely disproportionately affected by this sort of thing in general...but this was a case where gender is less important (contrasted to something like ""booth babes"" or pornography) and was a good opportunity to make this into a discussion about how it's also important to make EVERYONE feel welcome as opposed to a ""boys vs girls"" framing which can be toxic to productive conversation.<p>I have full confidence that Adria was acting almost entirely in good faith. I don't think she had anything personal against these guys, nor does she sit around hoping to be slighted or wronged so she can blog about it. However it's hard to sense any good faith reason to post the picture to twitter...it seems to be entirely punitive. It wasn't out of exasperated impotence because she hadn't even tried the proper channels. I likewise doubt it was for ""help in identification"" since she published it immediately when it was unnecessary. Also it's hard not to detect a little bit of glee in there, she clearly envisions herself as a crusader ""sticking it to the man"".<p>Everything Adria did is absolutely understandable, the sort of thing we all do. I agree it would be <i>nice</i> if she could have said something and resolved it there...however that's not reasonable to expect. There are a variety of legitimate reasons why she may not have been able to...and why it may not have been a good idea regardless. Simply going and talking to the appropriate person of authority should be enough.<p>As an activist I find the idea of losing empathy with those you disagree with extremely dangerous and counterproductive. It happens to all of us sometimes, it's just important to see it when it happens and check it. Likewise it's important to try and react appropriately/follow the correct channels. You won't always be able to...but we need to recognize when we mess up and apologize if necessary.<p>I don't think I need to spend much time discussing why this post and much of the response to Adrias original post disturb me. A lot of it is based purely in misogyny, reactionary, hateful, etc. I don't think it's hard to see a lack of empathy in this post, or an excessive eagerness to attribute negative motivations to Adrias actions.<p>So we end up with a victory that was deflated a bit by classic ills of activism, and then a possible productive discussion of those ills ruined by misogyny. As much as I hate to say it I do hope Adria apologizes - her actions certainly could use one and it would take the ammo away from those who would use this as ammunition against the cause she was working for in the first place.<p>I hope the person who wrote this post, along with the authors of the hateful replies apologize too...but I'm not holding my breath on that one.",1363826224

If you would, then that is part of the problem.<p>Now we're mixing scenarios. wpietri scenario was one I could not change anything because there wasn't anything to change. I don't walk into a gay bar and tell gay men to stop making jokes because they may or may not offend people. Same as I don't walk into a bad neighborhood and try to talk to shady people because I may feel offended by them dealing drugs.<p>What Adria did, did not help making men and women feel more comfortable working together. She made the opposite by publicly pillorying someone with the ""sexism"" hammer. That's a though position to be in as the receiving end.<p>> It's not really about one joke. It's about reinforcing a space that makes it easier to legitimize misogynist behavior through carelessness.<p>I don't agree at all. How do you come to that conclusion? What makes you think that someone who tells a dick joke would discriminate a woman? All those jokes about planes and towers may be childish and downright outrageous for someone that was affected by 9/11, but that does not make people suicide bombers.<p>> Like you said, ""in a room with countless other people""--these guys were in a professional setting, and the joke really had no place there. Maybe they didn't deserve to get fired over it, but it definitely was not the right venue.<p>If those people made a joke like ""A Mexican, a German and a French walk ..."" would you post their picture to Twitter with a headline like ""Those two guys behind my are xenophobes?"". No, of course not. You may turn and say that those comments are not appropriate. The guy didn't deserve to get fired at all.<p>> But it will reinforce a space that makes being religious an easy thing to ridicule, and it will increment the fear counter for any particular person in that space, and more importantly, will legitimize the attitudes of the other non-religious people around you who might have otherwise not done their part in contributing to a hostile environment.<p>You know what? It is my right to ridicule you for believing stuff. Even religious ideas, because they are not different from attitudes towards anything relative (like which music sucks and which not). If you feel offended in that scenario, then say so. If I'm a jerk I'll continue making additional comments. If I'm a nice guy, I'll apologize. You'll meet all kinds of assholes in your life and you'll be offended by a lot of stuff that's going on.

5411856,comment,5393588,5409282,1,0,dalke,,,"You made a specific statement that modern medicine is a ""poison"", according to the logic of ayurveda, because it is a treatment which is neither food nor herb.<p>Do you still regard modern medicine as ""poison""? If so, does that word have any meaning other than ""a treatment which isn't a food or an herb""? Are ultrasound treatments poison? And, are the ayurvedic categories useful for anything other than arbitrary labels? If so, how does knowledge of the categories affect treatment outcomes?<p>Western medicine doesn't reduce things into three different categories. Each type of molecule, and each combination of types, and each dosage, can have a different effect on different people. I am aligned with that more complicated view, and believe that those three labels you mentioned are worthless when it comes to categorizing treatments.<p>As to beriberi in Asia, I researched it before I posted my comment which is why I wrote, ""For several thousand years, beriberi was endemic in Asia, because polished white rice was a staple food.""<p>Here's one of the references I used: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889456/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889456/</a> , in looking specifically on the history of beriberi in India. It's a complicated history, mixed in with colonialism, and racism between English, Indian, and Chinese populations. But you'll have to tell me - what was the pre-1900 ayurvedic treatment for beriberi in India, where definitely there were many people in India who suffered from the disease, but before Western medicine found that it was a vitamin deficiency? My prediction is that ayurveda had no effective treatment for beriberi.<p>I disagree quite strongly with your claim that the western model is ""finding and curing diseases, not concentrating on health.""<p>How are fluoridated water, vitamin D in milk, iodine in salt, and enriched flour not prime examples of 'western medicine' using diet supplements to improve public health by preventing disease through improved diet?<p>Let's take rickets as an example. What's the historical ayurvedic treatment for rickets, and how does it distinguish between the different types of rickets? (I have to say 'historical' since it doesn't mean much if the ayurvedic treatment derived from Western knowledge, would it?)<p>I easily found <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=qbNK6dn_FKIC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=rickets+ayurveda&source=bl&ots=OO3xEcaIJ4&sig=W7yj69PWFk-O5Pzan80dUTfm1bQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=70ZKUebhN47Lsgb1_YHQDA&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=rickets%20ayurveda&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=qbNK6dn_FKIC&pg=PA98&#3...</a><p>which offers some medical advice, but it's wrong advice. Those oil massages (well, it is a massage book) don't appear to contain vitamin D, and in any case, vitamin D must be ingested to work. Also, while it suggests exposure to sunlight, which is one valid treatment, it suggests infra-red light as an alternative, which is wrong. Vitamin D production in the skin requires UV, not infrared.<p>I also found <a href=""http://india.mapsofindia.com/indian-medicines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://india.mapsofindia.com/indian-medicines/</a> which suggests Arbindasava - ""Effective in rickets and other diseases like fever, cough and constipation"" Arbindasava seems to be a general tonic. Or what I'll say is snake oil, given the diseases it claims to cure.<p>A problem, of course, is that there are several different ways to get rickets. Vitamin D diet deficiency is one, but some people can't process vitamin D from the diet so need exposure to sunlight. (Which I mentioned earlier.) What are the ayurvedic recommendations for these different types of rickets? Are those types based on Western research knowledge or were they known pre-1900?<p>You say there's ""a lot of knowledge of curing through herbs."" (Incidentally, I see that ""curing"" is now important, when you wrote that we should concentrate on health.) The Ancient Greeks had a lot of knowledge about curing. That doesn't mean their knowledge was correct, and it doesn't mean that they knew something better than we know now.<p>Similarly, you've made a claim, but where's the evidence? How did you determine if ayurvedic knowledge makes an effective improvement to public health, compared to western medicine? Or even that the synthesis of ayurvedic and western knowledge leads to improved health?<p>I think you'll say that you know people who have gotten better because of ayurvedic recommendations. As I've commented before in this thread, that's not enough. You have to know how many people didn't get better, and you have to know how many got better, or didn't get better, using western medicine. Otherwise your observations, while entirely accurate, suffer from a strong bias which makes it less convincing.<p>If you don't know the failure rates, then you don't have evidence.",1363826016

Take the least amount of stock possible - your startup is statistically unlikely to succeed. It'd be better to bump your salary up $10-20K than to get the stock.<p>2. Unless it's liquid - it's worthless.<p>3. Valuations pre-cashflow - are useless. Anybody can value anything at insane levels using just one dollar. I value HN at $1 billion by offering to buy only 1 share of 1 billion in common stock for $1 right now. See the implicit valuation leverage. I took a dollar, then invented the billion.<p>4. If you work for a ""nasty"" startup - one which people can consider to be negative long term to one or more parties - expect eventual collapse or flat line growth (Zynga/Groupon).<p>5. Companies exist to make management, investors and founders rich - they hold the vast majority of the stock - and benefit greatly from path dependence and network effects. You on the other hand don't. Expect to be screwed at any time.<p>Think of it like this. Managers/founders of most companies are pretty dipshit - how is it that they can own so much more stock? Simple. Be there earlier! Akin to how old money works. Imagine if you were the first person to squat land near what has now become Manhattan. You'd easily be worth hundreds of millions. There is obviously some skill in researching, predicting, working and acquiring land that will soon appreciate in value. But it's not worth nearly that much. Path dependence, luck and network effects do that. See GFC boom and that dumbass cousin who made and almost certainly lost millions in housing to understand how this works out.<p>Startups really aren't that different to a speculative investment in a house during boom times. Once you understand this - a lot of things start to make a hell of a lot more sense.<p>6. PG says be relentlessly resourceful. That's useful. But even better is to be relentlessly cynical.<p>Free t-shirts? Just an easy way to drop your salary and indoctrinate you - scratch that - it's a god damn uniform - freedom be damned! Free food? You took a $30-$40K pay cut to take the damn job - the food isn't worth a tenth of that + you're now working during lunch hours! Free hardware? That's only $2-$4K.<p>Hackathons? That's just work during your free time - or if it's during work time, it's a startup product you should own, but don't. More days off? Aren't you already working 60+ hours a week today! Culture shit after work? That's just more indoctrination. Gym membership? Only $200-500 - peanuts! Flexible work hours? That just means work more, but do it at times that aren't 9-5. Parental leave? Big companies and Europe have had that for ages.<p>Oh, and that culture fit crap? That's just discrimination - rebranded! What? You don't like what other late 20s upper-class educated males like? Be gone heathen!<p>End advice.<p>Not saying big companies or government jobs are any better.

Just because you feel like other people have it harder then you doesn't mean that you're not allowed to feel sad or down. Personally I find one of the most demoralizing things is feeling like your emotions are invalid, and feeling guilty for feeling bad only makes things worse. It may not seem obvious but everyone has their freak outs and times where things are rough and that is ok.<p>2) It may sound weird but try exploring how the emotions feel. Do they feel different in different situations? Is it more pronounced in certain situations? Does the feeling have triggers or feel connected to any aspect of your life? I find simply thinking about how it feels can help me determine the source.<p>3) Find things to look forward to. It doesn't have to be big but it's important to plan things to look forward to, it helps a lot with getting through the rough times. Even something as simple as a nice dinner every once and a while, going out with friends, or even a cold beer after a days work.<p>4) Seriously think about what makes you happy and what you want to do. Don't let other people define happiness or success for you because ultimately they are not the ones who have to live your life.<p>Hopefully that helped.

This is great advice only for somebody who knows EXACTLY what they want, why they want it, and how it should be done.<p>$20-$25/hr will (very likely) get you either:<p>* A highly skilled designer in a foreign country without a firm grasp on English, American culture, or software (or whatever your industry might be).  They will not be familiar with the ideals, customs, culture, or values of your customers.  There will be hours wasted in communication and scheduling.<p>* A designer either currently in college or high school in the U.S. (I charged $20/hr when I was in 11th grade many years ago).  This person will likely be O.K. at design, and have a good grasp on the customer.  They will likely not know what they are doing with billing and time management, in addition to having other priorities, so your project has an alarmingly high change of being under-quoted and be delivered past deadline.<p>* On a rare occasion you get lucky - you might for example find a designer who just got laid off and doesn't know how much to charge and under-quoted the project.  Or maybe you found a recent grad who just needs money to live while they search for a job.  Either way - don't expect this.<p>Most customers are looking for somebody to work with them for 15+ hours planning the project, giving relevant insight (like what designs work well for what demographic etc.), and estimating costs/schedule.  That is why designers don't normally bill hourly.  Many of my customers when I freelanced were billed more for time spent in meetings with them than for actual work, mostly on $2,000+ projects.<p>My recommendation is this:  If you want a good designer, stop trying to do the work yourself and pay somebody who really knows what they are doing to do what they do.  The 8-10 hours of your own time spent looking for a deal on a designer is likely more expensive to your company than the $500 extra it would cost you to hire an awesome designer.",1363824651

I have a fairly high confidence <i>you won't</i> find funding. Looking at this from a VC perspective, the only way you are going to make money, it seems, is selling the data to weather companies. That's not exactly a huge business. Most VCs do not know <i>anything</i> about the weather/meteorological business. Even if a VC thought your idea was interesting, they would not invest because they don't have domain experience. VCs are very conservative. VCs want to minimize risks (paradoxically). Why do you feel others will be excited by what you do? Why do you feel <i>it's obvious</i> that others will be excited? Because it's not obvious to me. I don't want to seem pessimistic, but why would I feel excited about this? I check the weather maybe once a week, to figure out if it'll rain in the next few days. That's it.<p>I agree with staunch. Give yourself a deadline (6 months?) for either finding funding or becoming ramen profitable, and if you don't make it, pivot or shut down. Applying through online forms is <i>the worst</i> way to apply. Those forms get passed to Associates, who have no power to make the deal happen (only Partners have that power). Even cold-emailing partners at VC firms is a better path than that path. You <i>need</i> introductions. Go out and network. Go to meetups. Maybe even come down to the Bay Area and try to meet people and pitch what you're doing.

Women decide who wins the elctions - majority of voters are women: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20231337"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20231337</a><p>""One can advance equality and be vigilant against sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry and discriminatory behaviors without resorting to more of this us vs. them bullshit that ""men's rights"" evokes.""<p>That would argue that we only need men's rights movement, not a women's rights movement. Since the women's rights movement doesn't concern men's rights, we need a men's rights movement.<p>The biggest feminist organizations do not accept me as a member because of my gender. Their organization discriminates on the basis of gender. That's not equality. I cannot take part in the women's rights movement because of my gender. That's why we need a men's rights movement - so that men's gender equality problems are also taken care of. Currently 90% of the gender equality resources in politics is used for women's rights. That number should be 50%.<p>""In sum, a ""men's rights"" movement is not going to increase equality, because it is only going to codify more gendered division in the social fabric.""<p>You make the implicit claim that men's rights movement is for gender roles. That's not true. In addition, you can use your own argument against women's rights movement, as it 'codifices a gendered division'.<p>""If you're really interested in enhancing equality as a social good,""<p>I'm really interestd in equality, and men's rights is the most important movement in recent years. Almost nobody used to talk about gender equality issues concerning men. In recent years, after the men's rights movement was formed, there have been small mentions of men's rights in official statements in the country I live in. Without a men's rights movement all the gender equality policy would say would be about women. Therefore, it's pretty clear that the men's rights movement increases equality.<p>I cannot link sources because they're not in English, but it used to be that only representatives from women's rights organizations were given representation in the official gender equality council of my country. They only talked about women's rights. Now a few seats have been given to the representatives of the men's rights movement.",1363824186

5411666,comment,5410515,5411402,7,0,amw,,,"> Then I get out of the bar.<p>I don't feel that wpie's example was the best or even a good illumination of what he/she's trying to say, but the concern is legitimate. And saying, ""If you feel uncomfortable, get out of the bar"" is exactly the type of response that keeps making it hard for women in tech (and other subgroups in other groups). Would you say, ""If male programmers make you uncomfortable, don't learn to program""? If you would, then that is part of the problem.<p>> Feel unsafe about what? Their safety? Those guys made two harmless dick jokes while sitting in a room with countless other people.<p>It's not really about one joke. It's about reinforcing a space that makes it easier to legitimize misogynist behavior through carelessness. Like you said, ""in a room with countless other people""--these guys were in a professional setting, and the joke really had no place there. Maybe they didn't deserve to get fired over it, but it definitely was not the right venue.<p>> If I want to tell a blasphemous joke, do I have to take into account that someone could feel offended and fear for their safety because this joke could mean that I want to harm religious people?<p>Is that religious person one of very few religious people in a group of non-religious people? Then yes, you do. Your one joke will not make them think you are about to hurt them, no. But it will reinforce a space that makes being religious an easy thing to ridicule, and it will increment the fear counter for any particular person in that space, and more importantly, will legitimize the attitudes of the other non-religious people around you who might have otherwise not done their part in contributing to a hostile environment. Luckily for the religious, they rarely are in a position to be uncomfortable (well, unless you're anything but Christian in America), but if one of the goals of the space you are in is to make it a welcoming place for people of talent, religious or not, then telling blasphemous jokes is (obviously, I hope) not a way to do that.",1363824154
5411665,comment,5410515,5410805,6,0,eaurouge,,,"So I read the post on PasteBin and also read Adria's blog post and here's what I took from it.  Context matters.  Dongle jokes in the presence of friends (male and female) may be fine, hilarious even, heck I'm giggling inside just typing the word ""dongle"".  On the other hand, dongle jokes in a (not private, audible-to-others) conversation in a conference hall while representing your company are unprofessional, may be perceived by some to be sexist, and could be considered a fireable offense by your boss.  Guys in tech need to realize it's not about what <i>you</i> think is sexist or not, it's about how your comments <i>may</i> make others feel.  Yes, they need to be hyper aware that they're working with people with experiences wildly different from theirs; the hope is that one day such a diverse community will actually be reality.<p>And she didn't get the guy fired.  I think she went too far posting their picture.  But she wasn't the one making forking and dongle jokes while representing her company as a sponsor, he was.  And she didn't make the determination that that was a fireable offense, which I can see how a PyCon-sponsoring company might see it as one.<p>Oh and she hasn't set women's rights back any.

You can't make a joke about fire or a bomb there without potentially threatening public safety. By a similar logic, if you say things which negatively affect my state of being in the conference, then you are potentially at fault.<p>So is it possible to make a private joke in a conference room while someone is giving a presentation? I would argue that it is possible in some situations, but not in all situations. So before everyone rushes to judgement, consider whether this particular venue and setup does make the context for this joke different.<p>I think the employer overreacted.

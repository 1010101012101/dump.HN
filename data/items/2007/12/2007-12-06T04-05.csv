You may may to make some choices.  I was laptop shopping recently, and wanted basically the same features you listed, but found that light  + powerful was an odd combo.  <p>I decided on a Dell D830 with WUXGA 15""  screen (19020x1200) and the 9-cell battery.<p>Weight: ~6 lbs.<p>
I was considering the MacBook pro, but wanted the higher rez screen.  <p><pre><code> I got the FreeDOS version; Ubuntu will go on it, and  went for the least amount of bundled RAM, since it is WAY cheaper to buy that separately.  It's even cheaper  to buy it as a separate item from Dell themselves.  But better yet to go through Fry's or newegg.com</code></pre>",1196914883

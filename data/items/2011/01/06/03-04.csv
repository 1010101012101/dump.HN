The FCC is more than happy to step in and assume the power to regulate the internet, as every entity desires growth.<p>2. The more ISPs have to play to politics game, the more they will suck up to power, and look for ways to appease that power (ie gradual censorship).<p>To actually convince anyone, I'd suggest cutting most of the hyperbole and trimming up the salient points. In addition:<p>3. Communication has always been tiered between bundles of lowest-common-denominator services, and general net access.  Past innovations were driven by modems (at least $20/mo on top of a landline), while the masses had only dialtone.<p>4. Don't be scared by graphics showing lots of hypothetical pricing options, the highest priced tier (what one currently considers ""standard"") will be the standard $20-$40 more than the budget tier.

The more non-packagable applications there are in <i>widespread</i> use, the more common the demand for standard commodity access. Bittorrent and VPN are quite embedded.<p>5. If you are worried about net neutrality, work at a <i>local</i> level. Cities <i>already</i> have the power to regulate who strings wires on public land, and can even build out public infrastructure!

2073860,comment,2073192,2073822,0,0,Mz,,,"I don't think it's quite that simple.  Most scientific views boil down to ""belief"" -- by that I mean that most people are essentially taking the word of some expert or other without themselves genuinely understanding it and, also, the lovely drawings of the solar system, tectonic plates, etc that you find in scientific materials are basically made up fantasies.  If you used any kind of meaningful scale for the solar system, it would not fit on the pages of any book.  In 8th grade, the entire class was asked to do a model of the solar system.  I was sick and missed a bunch of school and turned mine in late.  The teacher was trying to ding me hard for not having a scale.  Then I explained that I had run the calculations and if I used 1mm = approx 33 million miles, then Mercury would be about 1mm from the sun, Venus would be about 2mm from the sun, Earth would be about 3mm from the sun and Pluto would be about 100 meters plus 8 millimeters and the model wouldn't even fit in the classroom.  Tectonic plate drawings are basically a mental model and while you can find geologic evidence of them, they don't look as nice and clean as the drawings suggest and it was a very controversial theory for like the first 50 years, IIRC.<p>So I think most arguments like this boil down to ""belief"" on both sides and it is usually pointless to try to sway the other side.  I didn't stop vaccinating based on ""scientific"" anything.  I stopped because the people who had information that was getting me healthier all were anti-vax.  So I stopped based on ""social proof"", so to speak -- which isn't really any different than most folks who believe their scientists and doctors are correct but they think it is vastly different, so my ""social proof"" only damns me as it is viewed as further evidence that I am a fruitcake.<p>So I generally make no effort to argue the science involved.<p>Peace.",1294285845

It's clearly possible to have supervisors on the JVM given Erlang has a version on there (called Erjang). In no way is it practical to have it in Java the language, because the language's semantics simply don't match supervisors as well and they wouldn't be that useful there.<p>You're making the mistake of taking all features one by one and saying ""sure, language X can do that"" without considering how they would interact together or how well they would fit the language as a whole. What happens when you have a bunch of processes linked together and you kill some of them while they're modifying shared data or holding locks? What happens to objects that are shared and that need to be converted when doing hot code loading in some processes while you kill processes holding versions that are too hold (because they're seen as oprhans)? How do you deal with preemptive multiprocessing and scheduling when everything is done at the same level in a single language? Can you keep the soft real-time constraints with the garbage collector you currently have (Erjang had to drop that constraint)?<p>It's [relatively] easy to just make a Frankenstein out of features because of Turing completeness. Making a sensible ensemble out of them is a challenge and Erlang does it in a way I haven't yet seen in other languages. If you've got other languages that do it as coherently and have been battle-tested for decades, I'll be glad to add them to the list.

It's basic economics and it'll always work. The involuntary bumping is really only ever experienced when there is mass delay (e.g. the snowstorm in nyc here recently). This is because there is significant seat inventory (again, think legacy airlines) and usually people can be re-routed with not much more than a few hours delay and a couple hundred bucks in their pocket.<p>Hotel costs (and food coupons) are only required (for domestic flights) if the delay is overnight or past a certain time-window. Often, again, once you opt-in for voluntary bumping, you agree to be denied access to any other offer that may be made via DOT guidelines.<p>Finally, miles are almost always worth more, if you're on an airline that values them properly (aa & united especially). Note that Citi have often invested in AA's holding company by buying miles:<p>""A total of $2.9 billion in additional liquidity and new aircraft financing was obtained. The $2.9 billion consists of: <i>$1.3 billion in new liquidity, including $1 billion in cash from the advance sale of AAdvantage â„¢ frequent flyer miles to Citibank</i> and $280 million in cash under a loan facility from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) secured by owned aircraft; and $1.6 billion in sale-leaseback financing commitments from GECAS for Boeing 737s previously ordered by the Company."" - <a href=""http://www.aa.com/i18n/amrcorp/newsroom/network_enhancements.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aa.com/i18n/amrcorp/newsroom/network_enhancements...</a><p>Clearly they're not worth nothing.<p>The tipping point however is that it's almost always cheaper for the airline to give you miles than money; the cost of miles can be deferred (and you might not even use them!). This makes them a better deal, as you can almost always exchange them for a greater dollar rate later on (e.g. to get a better hotel rate discount, a free flight elsewhere, etc).<p>(finally pro-tip, most airlines distinguish between miles claimable for status, and miles spendable on flights/services).",1294284776

I was diagnosed with CF in May 2001, just before I turned 36.  My oldest son was diagnosed the following month, shortly after turning 14.  (He was born the day after my 22nd birthday.  My youngest was born on my 5th wedding anniversary.  When I was married, I went around telling everyone my husband was too cheap to buy me anything. <wink>)<p>When I was first diagnosed, it was after having been bedridden for 3 1/2 months, after 10 weeks of sinusitis turned to pneumonia.  The first few years, I got my flu shot every year.  My then teenaged son refused his and was very adamant that he would rather have the flu than the flu shot.  I was very slow to join the anti-vax crowd and I don't promote it as a position.  But I did eventually stop getting my annual flu shot and my youngest son never got the last of his vaccinations.  The reason I stopped getting my vaccinations: Absolutely everyone (including my oldest son) who was helping me get well when most of the wold insisted it couldn't be done were strongly anti-vax.  No on tried to talk me out of it.  But I eventually decided to skip the shot and see if I did better.  I haven't gone back.<p>As for doctors over-prescribing medicine:  I think that bias is built in to the way they are compensated.  Drugs offer short-term gains with long-term consequences. The doctors can claim credit for the short-term gains while distancing themselves from the long-term negative consequences and not really owning that -- even though it isn't at all secret and everyone in the CF community refers to drug side effects as ""a necessary evil"".  If you are basically healthy, you can do this to yourself occasionally and it isn't necessarily a big deal.  But if you have a chronic, deadly condition, it helps to put you in the grave <i>and you cannot prove it</i>.  All the experts blame your genes, there aren't really big samples of groups of people successfully doing something else (just a few ""anecdotal""/lone nutcases like me), and doing nothing (which is what people seem to think I am doing) does in fact kill you if you have CF.<p>As for diet and lifestyle:  Life is chemistry.  Everything you eat, drink or touch impacts your body chemistry to some small degree.  If you are willing to do enough research and make enough changes, the chemical impact is greater than what drugs do to the body.  But it's hard to sell people on that.  <shrug><p>Thanks for your reply.",1294284577

As often with Ruby libraries, the devil is in the subtleties.<p>This does not work (although I think it could):<p>{""foo bar"": 'b'}<p>but this does:<p>{:""foo bar"" => 'b'}<p>Without being truly JSON compatible, it's only moderately useful.<p>One annoyance of Ruby for me has always been that many libraries, such as Rails, allow for symbols or strings interchangeably - but only in ""most"" cases, often leading to head banging in the other cases.<p>More intrigue: the syntaxes are also mixable<p>{foo: 'bar', ""add-a"" => 'dash', :'or a' => 'space in a symbol'}<p>is valid.",1294283031

Smallpox killed ~400 million people in the 20th century, that's not even accurate statistics as we largely wiped out the disease in the latter decades. It was also the cause of 1/3 of all blindnesses.<p>I fail to see how ""not wanting to believe"" vaccinations 'causing' autism is even relevant to the debate. I don't even see how a proven causal link between vaccinations and autism would even be relevant to the vaccination debate. I god honest don't give a fuck if vaccinations cause autism unless it's >1/2 because my child's risk of dying in an unvaccinated world is about 50/50 if I'm lucky.<p>IIRC measles mortality in the US currently stands at 4 in 100 million because of vaccinations. Before the vaccine was licensed measles cases averaged around 450 thousand per year. Within five years of the vaccine being licensed the number of reported cases dropped to ~20 thousand (note: a 22-fold drop in cases), when the second dose was recommended the cases dropped to the current baseline of a statistical <i>zero</i> thousand within five years.<p>This is equivalent to 68-thousand lives <i>saved per year</i> for the measles vaccination.<p>If you want to live without vaccination, sure go ahead. However I think you should be forced to pay for the 19 other vaccinations it requires to keep herd immunity that keeps people like you safe from deadly diseases like measles.",1294282994

My wife would have never started playing any of Zynga's games if there were not on Facebook, and neither would most of those whom I know play these games (my mom, sisters, etc.). In fact, I expect almost all of them would _stop_ playing these games if they were taken off of Facebook.<p>Online games much, much better than Farmville and Cityville existed for a long time before Zynga came around and none of these people played online games. Now, since it's integrated with Facebook (meaning it's easy to get to and play constantly, and has a good introduction vector) and since you can do nice little things like help your friends,  Facebook denziens eat it up. It's weird.",1294282913

Great link.<p>For example, Richard Branson credits working out and staying in shape with much of his success.<p>I kind of see physical fitness on two sides--internal and external.<p>Internally, if you're in better shape you're capable of performing better for longer periods of time. Less time sick, etc.<p>Externally, there is a lot of social science that thinner, i.e. more attractive, people are viewed as more disciplined, get better promotions, make more money, etc.<p>That doesn't mean you can't be successful as someone that's not attractive or thin, but all things constant, why put yourself at a disadvantage?  I say all of this not as someone who is thin, but someone who's taken a prolonged approach to being in better shape. When I graduated college I was at 255, and now I'm at 200. I could stand to lose some more weight, but the effects of eating better, working out and sleeping better have been of immeasurable benefit.",1294282906

Citations and glib technical language can be copied and pasted just as easily as mindless rants.<p>It is not enough to hold debates. One must also have the guts to draw conclusions.<p>Meanwhile, what's conspicuously missing from this particular cloud of chaff is a concise summary of the most recent epidemiological data. Should we not have plenty of that by now? Thanks to Wakefield, we have conducted an ""experiment"" over the last decade or so: Hysteria is up, and the vaccination rate is down. As a result, the incidence of preventable disease is measurably higher. Surely, if there is a correlation between autism and vaccination, the autism rate must now be significantly lower in these new unvaccinated populations? Or can we at least try to establish how many more kids have to suffer or die before we can draw that conclusion?",1294282903

I'm not even saying that nothing is useful.<p>What I'm saying is that if I had a zillion dollars, a magic wand, a dumptruck of pixie dust, and a flying unicorn? I still wouldn't be able to create an institution that I would feel comfortable with as being a steady generator of innovation. In addition, I can observe that, as you point out, these things are sociological in nature, not mathematical. I can further observe that lots of people make lots of money selling books and giving speeches and such claiming to be able to make the perfect institution. Since these people continue to generate new ideas and continue to write books and charge for speeches and seminars and such, I believe it is reasonable to assume they have no fully satisfactory answers. I can further observe that many institutions have spent tremendous amounts of money and effort into creating environments that spawn invention and innovation -- to very mixed results.<p>All of these observations lead me to a great deal of skepticism in regards to your statement. That doesn't mean that what you say has no value. I'm sure we could all agree on general attributes that most of the time provide more return than others. But that's a long way from the certainty I was hearing. People talk about fostering innovation and entrepreneurship like it was turning on a light, and that kind of certainty is ludicrous. It's nothing at all like that. All I was trying to do was provide context.<p>I'm done here. No desire to get into an infinite argument stream. Good thoughts. Thank you for sharing them.",1294282818

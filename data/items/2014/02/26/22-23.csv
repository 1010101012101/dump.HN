7308819,comment,7307518,7308292,4,0,briandear,,,"&quot;Further away from jobs..&quot; You just complained that they wouldn&#x27;t get jobs at trader joes, yet apparently they already have jobs. As far as &quot;affordable housing.&quot; I&#x27;m tired of that excuse for letting neighborhoods turn into poverty factories. As far as them having no place to go, many of the working poor in those neighborhoods own their homes or they have a mortgage on their home which, due to the 2008 housing crash is likely worth less than they owe and due to likely bad credit is probably at an interest rate that&#x27;s killing them. I&#x27;m studying a neighborhood in San Antonio called Denver Heights which is a really poor east-side neighborhood -- 40% of those homes have been foreclosed on. So that&#x27;s telling me that those homes were owned by poor people and not some evil rich investors. If Trader Joe&#x27;s had been built in that neighborhood, perhaps many of those families would still have a home because the equity increase would result in them being able to favorably refinance rather than losing the home to the bank. Now when you drive through there, it&#x27;s almost a rotting ghost town.<p>This could provide a huge benefit to those people. But I guess we can just ignore the positive benefit to those people. Instead let&#x27;s kill the development in the interest of &quot;saving&quot; the bottom 1% at the expense of other people in the neighborhood, many of whom are the working poor. This Trader Joe&#x27;s deal could have make them fairly rich. If they own a $40K home that&#x27;s now worth $150K, they just made $110K. They could refinance their home, cash out the equity and use that money to start a business, pay debt or buy more property. With one deal, they wouldn&#x27;t be poor anymore. These &quot;community groups&quot; rather than trying to keep people victims ought to be out there teaching about real estate, investing and starting businesses, but alas, they only teach about how oppressed they are.<p>You&#x27;re suggesting that if someone is poor in a neighborhood, we should ensure that everyone else gets fucked just to look after them? You are aware of something called Section 8, I presume? Do you know anything about how it works? Apparently not. If we followed your logic, then there would be no such thing as neighborhood revitalization, because a revitalized neighborhood necessarily results in higher property values. Interestingly, neighborhood revitalization has a positive effect on schools, especially in reducing de facto segregation. But of course, we can&#x27;t have the schools improving because then the poor kids wouldn&#x27;t have any more excuses and the poverty pimp business would dry up within a generation.<p>An empty lot benefits nobody.",1393455484

In this case, Github is leveraging a technology specifically optimized for text and styling. They don&#x27;t have to maintain it, and they get a lot of cutting-edge optimizations for free.

Once this is done, the user must enter their iCloud Security Code. The HSM cluster verifies that the user knows their iCloud Security Code using Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP); the code itself is not sent to Apple. Each member of the cluster independently verifies that the user has not exceeded the maximum number of attempts that are allowed to retrieve their record, as discussed below. If a majority agree, the cluster unwraps the escrow record and sends it to the user’s device.<p>Next, the device uses the iCloud Security Code to unwrap the random key used to encrypt the user’s keychain. With that key, the keychain—retrieved from iCloud key value storage—is decrypted and restored onto the device. Only 10 attempts to authen- ticate and retrieve an escrow record are allowed. After several failed attempts, the record is locked and the user must call Apple Support to be granted more attempts. After the 10th failed attempt, the HSM cluster destroys the escrow record and the keychain is lost forever. This provides protection against a brute-force attempt to retrieve the record, at the expense of sacrificing the keychain data in response.<p>These policies are coded in the HSM firmware. <i>The administrative access cards that permit the firmware to be changed have been destroyed.</i> Any attempt to alter the firmware or access the private key will cause the HSM cluster to delete the private key. Should this occur, the owners of all keychains protected by the cluster will receive a message informing them that their escrow record has been lost. They can then choose to re-enroll.",1393454924

When you look at Mario you know you&#x27;re looking at a stout little man with a hat, you can identify his eyes, ears, nose, hair, hat, moustache, shirt, gloves, overalls and shoes. Given that knowledge, if I were to depixelize Mario&#x27;s sprite, I&#x27;ll know the rough shape of his shoes and where the shading should go and what shape it should have, i.e. I can reason what the 3D shape is and how the 2D shape was derived from that. I&#x27;ll also be able to identify which lines were put there to make sure separate elements can be legible and not make those thicker than needed. Or that his eyes blend with his hat simply because there aren&#x27;t enough pixels to make them separate.<p>For simple shapes, like the background, their algorithm works really well, but for complex objects it fails, because it distorts details that were put in with very careful thought and completely depend on the resolution. Such small sprites rely a lot on being looked at by someone who can identify semantically what they&#x27;re looking at, and any really successful depixelization solution will need to be able to understand what basic shapes the sprite is made of based on what it&#x27;s supposed to represent.",1393454230

No doubt many different kinds of meditation are beneficial, but I suspect they have different effect sizes. Probably some do nothing for you at all.<p>The most unexpected consequence of breath-counting is how dispassionately I see my random intrusive thoughts during meditation, whether it&#x27;s anger at someone, a happy memory, or a worry about some future task. It sounds crazy to non-meditators, but it&#x27;s actually hard for me to not to laugh during meditation sessions at how ephemeral and &quot;unreal&quot; these thoughts are... and how quickly all emotions, sensations, thoughts move in and depart like blips on the screen of mind.<p>After breath-counting for half an hour, I feel a much deeper, more substantial calm than if I&#x27;d done something like listening to relaxing noises in the same time. It&#x27;s a calm of mind that bleeds into the rest of the day, because meditation gives practice at seeing the shape-shifting nature of thoughts and human identity.<p>Does the kind of meditation practiced on this site have similar effects?",1393454055

However, there are serious problems on Earth in the U.S. that cannot be solved by developing manned spaceflight tech, and those concerns are going to override thoughts about manned spaceflight for most people most of the time.  What drove the space program (first unmanned, then manned, then to the Moon) was national pride and the desire to out-compete the Soviets.  I don&#x27;t see any available current of feeling that could generate similar support today.<p>Ignore the Shuttle for a moment and imagine we&#x27;d kept human-carrying spacecraft perched on top of rockets, like we did before; in other words: safer, cheaper, manned spaceflight in the modern era.  What has manned spaceflight achieved in the last 30 years?  We&#x27;ve serviced some satellites, certainly, but at what cost compared to simply deorbiting them and launching new ones?  Experiments in space have advanced medical and materials science technology somewhat, but consider how far we could have advanced if all the money thrown at the Shuttle and ISS programs had been allocated to automated/remote-controlled experiments and, where possible, simulations.  Whatever the difference is, those are missions where you could make a case for a manned mission to conduct experiments, but I doubt there would be very many.<p>Next, let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical Zubrin-inspired mission to Mars.  It would inspire everyone, but for how long?  People don&#x27;t stay inspired forever, and suppose it becomes apparent that we&#x27;ll never go back to Mars again because the cost/benefit is too high, or heaven forbid if the mission <i>fails</i> because the astronauts die unexpectedly.  Things on Earth become <i>worse</i> because the <i>hope</i> of productive Mars missions will have dimmed.<p>Americans have become much more risk-averse.

They&#x27;re going to be selling goods and hiring people -- who pay taxes. They&#x27;re going to provide an anchor which means that small businesses nearby will benefit, which provides yet more jobs. These &quot;poor&quot; people should have seen this for the opportunity that is was -- a chance to get ahead. What&#x27;s to stop some of these &quot;oppressed&quot; people from banding together and starting a small business themselves to benefit from the Trader Joes anchor? At the very least, Trader Joes and the associated business have to hire people from somewhere.. why couldn&#x27;t these &quot;poor&quot; people have applied for jobs? The funny thing is the complaint about the tax benefits is profoundly stupid. The net gain is much, much greater than the &quot;loss&quot; from the tax discount. Now there is absolutely no gain at all. There isn&#x27;t going to be any tax revenue at all now. They managed to get themselves 100% of nothing. But at least that &quot;nothing&quot; stays in the community.<p>My theory about this story is that these poverty pimps that claim to be community activists have no interest in bettering their supposed constituents. So now there&#x27;s no Trader Joes and therefore there&#x27;s zero gain to the community. So rather than collecting something in taxes as well as the benefits from the economic stimulus, they get nothing -- an empty lot. 10% of something is a heck of a lot better than 100% of nothing. And, some of those poor people actually own their homes, some are upside down because of bad mortgages, the dramatic property value boost that would have happened could have turned many lives around. Now the values will drop even more because an investor knows that that neighborhood has zero potential for growth and thus nothing would drive capital appreciation. This whole &quot;protest&quot; was so incredibly stupid that it&#x27;s mind boggling -- unless you ask yourself who benefits from Trader Joes not opening.. The poverty pimps and the community &quot;organizations&quot; that have a vested interest in keeping people dependent on their &quot;services.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like when certain groups of black people ostracize kids that study hard in school, claiming they&#x27;re &quot;acting white.&quot; We can&#x27;t have that -- they might actually make something of themselves and disprove the sanctity of victimhood within the inner city. It&#x27;s funny because Michelle Obama made a big deal about how there are these so-called &quot;food deserts&quot; in the inner city. Apparently, Trader Joe&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the right kind of grocery store to make that group happy. Maybe they can build a liquor store and a pawnshop there instead. Would the community complain then? I seriously doubt it. If Trader Joes wasn&#x27;t a white-hipster paradise, this &quot;protest&quot; would not have happened. This same exact segment of the population complains about de facto segregation and yet when there&#x27;s an effort to actually bring some economic activity to a primarily black area -- they complain. Damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t. Maybe this &quot;community group&quot; should have put it to a vote. Let the neighborhood decide rather than some group that claims to represent the neighborhood.<p>The people that oppose this deal obvious no nothing about real estate, development and economic stimulus -- instead they actually enjoy seeing neighborhoods deteriorate, because with depressed neighborhoods, that victim card gets much more shiny and useful and the politicians that prey on these people get more votes.",1393453938

Chrome is far from being the only web browser, and if Gmail is perceived as being slow compared to other webmail websites, Gmail will suffer accordingly.  Gmail has no incentive to cripple the speed of JS-only browsers; it has the incentive to make its app as fast as it possibly can on all major browsers.<p>So if hypothetical future Dart-Gmail is noticeably faster than JS Gmail, then it is likely for some fundamental reason of Dart being more optimizable, and not because of any lack of effort to make the JS version fast.<p>At this point, where the Dart version is faster for purely technical reasons, you say that &quot;adopting the VM might be the only option&quot; for other browsers.  I would say first of all that it seems that there are other options, like compiling Dart to asm.js in a very peripheral part of the browser so that you wouldn&#x27;t have to change your core execution VM.  Given that the Dart VM is open source, this would be adding a new backend to an existing compiler (sort of like you did with Emscripten and LLVM), and not an effort comparable to developing a new compiler from scratch.  It&#x27;s true that this would require you to adopt some third-party code, but it would keep the Dart <i>VM</i> out of your browser, if not the Dart <i>compiler</i>.<p>But suppose that even that wasn&#x27;t acceptable or feasible.  Now the question is, is it better for (some) users to get the advantage of technology that has demonstrated that it is inherently faster, at the cost of other vendors being pressured into adopting this (standardized) technology, or is it better for all users to be equally disadvantaged, to keep the browser playing field more level?<p>As you surely know, browsers aren&#x27;t just competing against each other, they are competing against other app platforms like native apps.  If the web stays a little slower but all browser vendors are more equal, then the whole web is falling behind compared to the other, far less open and level, app platforms.<p>Now all of this discussion is quite premature until/unless Dart is actually distributed as part of Chrome, and the Dart VM is actually found to be noticeably faster than regular JavaScript, and Google actually uses Dart on its big properties.",1393453877

Redlining was in no small part due to direct federal policy.  These have had impact on our neighborhoods, impact that can&#x27;t be downplayed, and communities adjusted to survive.  Gentrification in a lot of ways looks like the undoing of these policies, which would be fine, but look closer and you see that the neighborhood ecosystems are being strained yet again.  Whatever equilibriums were obtained (many via struggle and sweat equity by families with ties to the area/no other options) are now being threatened.<p>I think reparations to neighborhoods, communities, and people directly affected by redlining is necessary, and would serve to lessen the power differential between communities and neighborhoods.

That said, I&#x27;d like to toss in an interesting historical perspective here.<p>Gentrification is something that happens primarily to predominantly African-American neighborhoods in the US, and one of its effects is eventually pricing the poor black community out of the neighborhood. But here&#x27;s a question... where are the middle class black families?<p>Historically, racial segregation happened across economic boundaries. A black doctor or a black lawyer was still black, and unwelcome in white neighborhoods. This meant that historically black neighborhoods had a rich, vibrant economic culture, with wealthy members of the community living among the poor, supporting local business and providing role models for youth.<p>With the success of the civil rights movement in the 1960s came a new geographic social mobility for black professionals. Those who could afford it could now move into nicer, cleaner, safer, white neighborhoods. And they did so. And the more it happened, the worse the black neighborhoods got, creating more pressure for those who could afford to leave to leave. Eventually, the historically black neighborhoods were stripped down to ghettos, dominated by gang violence and devoid of the local businesses that once served the middle class. Soon, the only opportunity for jobs and social advancement was outside the neighborhood, and poverty grew even worse. It&#x27;s a terrible cycle.<p>This was aggravated further by the (illegal) practice of redlining, where banks colluded to deny funding to entire neighborhoods, depressing real estate prices and driving homes and businesses into foreclosure. (White) developers could then swoop in and buy land at fire-sale prices, building out the new infrastructure for a wave of gentrifying whites looking for cheap nice houses in the heart of the city.<p>Think about this, and you can see the resistance to gentrification. Historically, it&#x27;s been nothing but trouble for the people already in a neighborhood.",1393452737

However, Sublime is (mostly) blazingly fast. I don&#x27;t expect this from a node based app, especially in Windows. And: I didn&#x27;t see it under Features, but Atom definitely needs the command palette from Sublime baked into core. Only if it&#x27;s core, plugin authors will set their hooks correctly from the beginning. Or even better, there might be a flexible command api that exposes each plugin&#x27;s commands from the start and can be extended too. -> edit: the readme says it has Command Palette. Great! Also, since the term is identical with Sublime Text, I wonder if there&#x27;s more to it than inspiration.",1393452474

7308323,comment,7307311,7308053,1,0,paddyforan,,,"Disclosure: I am not a Very Important Programmer.<p>Second Disclosure: I am not on top.<p>Were either of these different, I might feel differently than I do.<p>Some people do prefer email to the phone. I have no problem with a recruiter <i>offering</i> the option to have a phone call. I have problems with recruiters <i>requiring</i> the phone call before I can even talk to someone who will make a decision. Hell, the last recruiter blatantly told me they would not <i>tell me the name of the company they were hiring for</i> until I was on the phone with them. Perhaps it&#x27;s my arrogance, but that doesn&#x27;t to be a matter of &quot;some people like the phone better&quot;.<p>You are right, not every recruiter needs to read my blog or Twitter enough to realise that I have a boyfriend. That is a terrible example. I&#x27;ll iterate on it with an updated draft that better gets across the point--perhaps a suggesting I work in an enterprise environment would be a better example, as I&#x27;m decidedly unsuited to that environment, and that&#x27;s obvious if you know anything about me at all.<p>I believe a bare minimum of a job description--the company they&#x27;re hiring for, something about the culture or problem they&#x27;re solving, the stack they use, maybe why they think you&#x27;d be a good candidate--is probably a good bet. I get too many recruiter emails like my sample that don&#x27;t tell me, quite literally, anything about the company. At all. No name. No website. No size. Nothing that would allow me to determine if this is an opportunity I should pursue or not.<p>I believe I pointed out that recruiters are busy and that I am busy. I am well aware I&#x27;m not the only busy person out there. :) If you think this is disrespectful, I&#x27;d certainly love to find ways to fix this.<p>I think you may be unfamiliar with the level of interaction recruiters provide. The publicists sending the mass pitches you describe are the bad recruiter pitches I am talking about. It is not a matter of me having very specific guidelines for how I am spoken to before I&#x27;ll consider a job; it&#x27;s a matter of an industry whose norm is to type in search terms, then hit all the results with a form letter.<p>This letter is in case one of those who are trying to do a good job are seeing everyone else use the form letter and assuming that is how it&#x27;s done. Or who simply don&#x27;t know how to put themselves into an engineer&#x27;s shoes to effectively communicate a pitch.<p>I resent your accusation that I believe recruiters are somehow beneath me. I actually, as I mentioned, believe recruiters have a really cool job. I don&#x27;t have the aptitude for it, but I do not believe that making lights flash in a pleasing pattern is somehow a worthier job than connecting people to jobs that fulfill them. And yes, there are recruiters I love. They are the ones I send referrals to when a friend asks who is hiring. They are the ones I seek out. Which, for a recruiter, is a powerful card to hold in a limited market. I&#x27;m trying to give as many recruiters that card as I can.<p>I deal with recruiters all the time. I got my current job through a recruiter. He was fantastic. I have nothing against recruiters, or I would just set up a spam filter and call it a day.<p>I wrote this because I ask for feedback when I&#x27;m in the hiring process, so it struck me that recruiters might also like feedback. It seems to me that this is the opposite of what you accuse me of; if I didn&#x27;t care about the recruiter, considered them lesser, or didn&#x27;t think they cared about their job, why would I care if they got the feedback they needed to improve? I&#x27;d ignore them and move on. It&#x27;s certainly less effort.<p>And it results in fewer people assuming I think my ass is the gravitational pull of the universe without bothering to find out anything about me.",1393452044

It is easy to imagine a scenario where a development provides negative impact to those who live near by.

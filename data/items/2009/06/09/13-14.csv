On the other hand, my partner is a technician in school and constantly battles with teachers trying to browse facebook during lessons when they should be teaching. Clearly the latter can have a direct impact on the quality of the job that person is doing.

649023,comment,647706,647960,0,0,marvin,,,"Glider pilot here. I have decent knowledge of aerodynamics, but have never studied large jets in detail. This is my personal theory - essentially what lies behind the words of a few articles I have read over the last few days, but the authors haven't been able to formulate it clearly.<p>Assuming that the autopilot and fly-by-wire systems were somehow compromized, a full stall in the ""Coffin Corner"" (Q-corner) would be a very, very serious condition. A stall causes the nose to drop and speed to accumulate. Since the difference between the stalling speed and the never-exceed speed is so small at the altitude in question, this accumulation of speed could easily cause the plane to exceed its critical Mach number, causing supersonic shockwaves around certain parts of the airfoil. In planes not designed for supersonic flight, these shockwaves will eventually cripple the effect of the control surfaces. If the plane is in a nose-down position when it looses effect on its elevator rudder, the plane will overspeed and eventually suffer structural failure (essentially meaning the loss of some critical part) due to flutter (resonance in parts of the airframe) or aerodynamic stresses.<p>A stall during normal flight conditions doesn't have to be a serious problem, but these weren't normal flight conditions. And the information that we have suggests that certain Airbus models have had problems with their pitot (speed measurement) systems in icing conditions, leading to erroneous speed readouts. The fly-by-wire system, which prevents the pilot from flying the aircraft into stall or overspeed, cannot function correctly without a correct speed measurement. And as I have detailed, a proper stall might be enough to doom the airplane.",1244553813

It started by the pic being of battered and shot young men (""beat up your friends"").<p>Around here, they're showing ads by those scammers who promise free phone games or whatever to the young and naive, who then find themselves enrolled in a paid weekly subscription, charged to the phone account. Someone made them put a small cryptic price-tag on the pics, but still ...<p>This kind of scam is also all over the free (and not only) newspapers. The ad-carriers smell the money and do it, but the real fault is with the telecom operators, who are allowed to act as currency issuers, and get a nice fat cut.<p>P.S. My last line to Google, about the scammers, was ""Cut them off. The stench clings."" That goes triple for the telecom operators. They get the money now, and the guys in charge get their bonuses. Their name being mud doesn't seem to get to the bottom line, but it will.<p>P.P.S. The carrier with a clear 'no scams, no money transfers' policy will get my kids phones in a couple of years, and possibly the rest of the family. Companies would probably also appreciate it. Rub two brain cells together, marketing guys.",1244553231

648985,comment,648055,648209,0,0,timwiseman,,,"You have a very good point, and I slightly disagree with that statement in the blog post.  But I think the core point he was trying to make has some validity.  Perhaps it could be more accurately (if less succinctly) said:<p>""The specific technologies you learn today will either fade into obscurity or else evolve dramatically.  To remain at the high end, you must continue to either follow those evolutions, learn the newer technologies, or preferably both.""<p>For instance, I am not a FORTRAN or ruby expert, but I understand they have both evolved enormously since their initial release and someone who has not kept up will at least be at a disadvantage.  I do follow MS SQL Server closely and someone who learned on say MS SQL Server 6.5 would miss out on a lot of advantages of MS SQL Server 2008 if they had not made the effort to keep up with the evolutions in between.<p>As a side note, I knew a lady like that.  She was a nice person, but she learned SQL Server 6.5 just to get a job and did not keep up with the changes.  A lot of the code she wrote had to be run in compatibility mode and of course she missed out on newer features that would have made her code faster and easier to read simultaneously.  She ended up getting laid off.<p>As for Cobol, correct me if I am wrong, but very little new development is done there, it is mostly maintenance coding and small upgrades for very old systems.  Even if it paid the bills, I would not want to wind up as that guy maintaining ancient code that was simply too entrenched to be replaced yet personally.",1244552694

The U.S. has sizable African-American and Latino-American minorities, often segregated into their own neighborhoods, and that often informs how the white majority votes -- i.e. things like welfare and prison reform are viewed as handouts to people not like themselves. You might say it&#x27;s comparable to how perceptions of Greek laziness inform German attitudes towards debt cancellation.<p>* Geography - The U.S.&#x27;s political system grants a disproportionate power to sparsely populated states (e.g. a state like Wyoming has more electoral votes per person than California, and states like Iowa and New Hampshire have a large say in how the presidential primaries turn out). This matters with respect to policies that might be considered urban-centric -- e.g. public transportation.<p>* Militarism - The U.S. is the only country that regularly projects force halfway around the globe, and it&#x27;s super expensive. Every dollar spent on bombs is a dollar not spent on healthcare. It&#x27;s a good question as to why American voters constantly favor military might, but it&#x27;s not necessarily an irrational choice. Or rather, you could argue that it wasn&#x27;t an irrational choice during WW2 and the Cold War, but that the development of a military-industrial complex has had lasting effects on American politics.",1440604716

If not, there are plenty of straightforward processes that can go in place.<p>- First is, where possible, you get the replacement in on a defined temporary cover contract, and do a proper handover of duties to them.<p>- Second, you offer the person on leave paid &quot;Keep in Touch&quot; days that allow the person to stay abreast of what&#x27;s happening.<p>- Thirdly, when they return you have a formal hand-back session that brings the person up to speed and makes it clear to all their contacts that they have returned to their responsibilities and taken back over their old position.<p>I have seen this work correctly and smoothly multiple times, for both maternity and long-term sick leave.

10123791,comment,10122295,10123297,0,0,aamar,,,"I think it requires awareness about how deep the value of your product goes. E.g. I knew the creators of a very popular cable show (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy) and despite surprising overnight mainstream success they were remarkably clear-eyed about how long the phenomenon was likely to last and how to exploit it over that time period. Other shows in related genres like Top Chef or Project Runway were capable of a longer life because their premises inherently support a richer variety of stories. Both kinds of properties can be valuable.<p>Angry Birds is predicated on a great, clever irony: fuzzy, harmless-looking creatures with facial expressions and behavior of furious vengeance. But it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s a lot of deeper/substantive places to go with that: a single emotional register is quite limiting for storytelling.<p>The odd thing is that Rovio&#x27;s actions are a mix of rapid exploitation (all the brand-sapping tie-ins, not embedding the birds in a bigger &#x27;universe&#x27;) and enterprise building (huge headcount, freemium model).",1440604604

It took two very long days to install an OS on a machine and get it to boot (I had to assembly my computer and then use the corporate installer, which failed multiple times with errors like “an unknown error occurred”). It then took me about a week to run the local project’s “hello world” (I was initially pointed to documentation that had been deprecated for months, and then when I found the right documentation it was incomplete and out of date). The actual process to get there was hilariously baroque; for example (if my email records are correct and I didn’t get duplicate emails from the system), I must have clicked through 18 EULAs to get a subset of the permissions I need. I promise, that’s worse than it sounds since the form to do so took more time to click through than you can imagine. It was a month before I could effectively do any work at all.<p>I originally thought that I was just unlucky, but when I asked around I found that I had an above average experience, at least among people near me who started recently. Unlike many other folks, I was actually able to get a username/alias, a computer, and an office. I don’t know what folks without a username do since they can’t even start clicking through the necessary EULAs to get permissions to do stuff, let alone do any actual work.<p>I’m not sure how it is in other parts of the company, but if you imagine that it’s similar and do some back of the envelope math on how many people get onboarded and how much losing a month (or more) of time costs, it comes out to N million dollars for a non-trivial N. And that’s just the direct cost of the really trivial stuff. It’s hard to calculate the cost of the higher level stuff that’s mentioned in the article, but I suspect that’s even more expensive.",1440604289

I mean take a look at the Atom editor; they initially used it which helped speed up their development but after a certain point they benchmarked it and found simply manipulating the DOM itself was far faster. Now that doesn&#x27;t mean to never use React; all that means is simply use the right tool for the right job.<p>If you need something done and done fast with decent code separation, feel free to pick up React. If you need to optimize for performance (because many of us need to at some point) or you have a good understanding / way to architect your code to keep up a good separation of DOM and business logic then use almost anything else.<p>Hell, you don&#x27;t even need to use a framework for the web.

We all are in fact. It&#x27;s a stratification of society; there&#x27;s one transportation scheme for the rich, Uber, and one transportation scheme for the poor, government-funded mass transit. And mass transit is barely funded in the United States as is. Once the rich have alternatives how long do you think it will take for people to whine &quot;why should I pay taxes for a service I don&#x27;t use? I can afford Uber I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for busses for poor people&quot;. Three months? Six? Maybe a year? If people use Muni every day they&#x27;re willing to support it. If not, well... Then the wealthy with all of the political clout will push to defund our &#x27;inefficient&#x27; public transit and it will become unusable.<p>I think that it would be really nice to let private industry test things like this, but their tests are completely worthless from the perspective of providing actual mass transportation. They will find ways to take wealthy affluent people from places where wealthy affluent people live to places where wealthy affluent people work. The government isn&#x27;t allowed to cater only to the rich in the pursuit of profits so unfortunately the results of the experiment will always say: hello government, if you stop taking care of those pesky poor and disabled and old citizens, you could have a very efficient system and reap great profits.

While I&#x27;ve received support from everyone in the team, the most helpful person has actually been an intern with only a few years of programming experience under his belt. While I have over a decade more general programming experience than he has, he knows a lot more about the specific domain, and has been an excellent teacher.

Density isn&#x27;t high enough to support transit, so it would be unwise to waste tax revenue in elephants, but without the build-up, the environ for mass transit isn&#x27;t stoked.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care who comes up with a financially viable solution, public or private.  Having seen what public delivers, I&#x27;m optimistic private can compete and deliver something meaningful in under three decades of studies, agreements, bonds issuing, lawsuits, etc.  Overseas, private mass transit delivers at least on par with public mass transit.  Moreover, the NYC subway system was borne from originally private systems.<p>I guess autonomous vehicles like uber&#x27;s are likely to win out over the ideas by united technologies&#x27; &quot;people movers&quot;.

That said, I rarely choose it for projects.&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t find one reason why ES6 and component-like architecture wouldn&#x27;t be chosen &quot;often&quot; for projects? React is the first javascript (frontend) framework I use that allows to easily break down architecture and keep a complex (or simple) application clean and well structured. It feels like writing server-side code.<p>&quot;For static sites, Jade is a fantastic templating engine.&quot;
Cool. But why compare how to use a javascript, dynamic framework for static sites? That&#x27;s just a bad argument.<p>&quot;For data-bound REST apps, I choose Angular. &quot;
Good for you but... why Angular over React? Those are 2 frameworks that are supposed to do the same thing (build dynamic front end applications) with 2 different sets of mind.
But... I build REST apps with React. I even build Forms with React. And they are not even dynamic. What&#x27;s wrong with it? It makes my code, form validation, form submit way cleaner, easier and reusable!
What should I do instead? Use vanilla js? jQuery? Why? Because it&#x27;s enough? It&#x27;s enough, but trust me, I&#x27;ve recently (no later than last week!) refactored some of our forms with React, and it-is-so-much better.<p>I totally agree with the author&#x27;s point of &quot;do not use X for the hype and everything, but use X for the good reasons&quot; but the argument given is plain bad and examples are wrong.",1440602862

For sure there are some Uber users who are too good for public transportation, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a majority.<p>The real reason not to take the MUNI is speed.  The MUNI is really, really slow.  First of all it&#x27;s a bus in SF traffics so it&#x27;s a natural disadvantage except where it has a preferred lane.  Second, the MUNI stops way too frequently, which adds many minutes to travel time.  Sometimes it stops at every block [0].  So a ride on the MUNI that would be about 40m will be 20m in an Uber because the Uber will stop only 1-2 times depending on how many people you&#x27;re sharing the ride with.  So the MUNI is $2.25 and the Uber will be about $6 (in my experience).  If you add in the convenience of hailing the Uber with your phone and getting to track it with GPS, you can see why people with extra money would use this.<p>However you should not take this as an endorsement, it&#x27;s simply an explanation.  I find it pathetic that the best SF can offer me to get from the north part of the city to downtown is a 45 minute jam-packed bus ride.  It&#x27;s only 3 miles!

That&#x27;s not their job.<p>This isn&#x27;t a private vs. public story. Let the private industry prove out the model at their own risk and their own expense. Let them recoup the expense and pocket some profit for the risk at the expense of those who can afford the service. (The poor are not actually <i>hurt</i> by not having access to Uber, anymore than they were hurt by not having access to it 10 years ago.) Let the government come in behind and work on providing services based on the risks taken and the lessons learned. Perhaps even by contracting out to Uber, or perhaps more likely, a yet-to-be-founded mass-transit-focused competitor, when the model has been derisked enough that the poor aren&#x27;t at high risk of being boned by the vagueries and vissitudes of Silicon Valley unicorns.<p>This would hold true even if all the city governments were models of efficiency, and all had highly trained and skillful staffs of programmers on staff who could easily write all this code. But come now, even you promoters of government, let&#x27;s all be honest with each other, this is not the case. And, again, that&#x27;s not least because it would be unacceptable for a mass transit authority to hire all that talent when it should be using money to <i>provide service</i>.<p>Government can&#x27;t be good at everything, because there are something things that it can only be good at <i>at the expense of</i> other things it is supposed to be doing instead. Wildly risky experimentation certainly sounds like a good candidate for that category to me.<p>[1]: By contrast, to be clear, I am fully behind <i>incremental</i> advancement, exploration, and development by governments. It routinely happens and it should. But in general, it is not their job to do moon shots with social programs. (Note the &quot;moon shot&quot; and &quot;the bomb&quot; and all the other really <i>experimental</i> stuff that you might want to name are not <i>social programs</i>. A line of military research coming up dry does not directly harm the poor. (Especially under progressive taxation where &quot;the poor&quot; pay either very little or negative taxes in the US, so you can&#x27;t even really complain about their tax load.))",1440602027

For the sake of brevity I&#x27;ll stick with only 3:<p>> Rebuild Infrastructure<p>> Reverse Climate Change<p>> Health Care as a Right for All<p>I honestly don&#x27;t understand how every candidate isn&#x27;t running with at least the first of that list on their platform. Our infrastructure is barely viable at this point and has been limiting our growth since the start of the software revolution. This is a bigger problem on more local levels but those get their initiatives from the fed and thus it&#x27;s a place to start.<p>Reversing climate change (or at least reducing the effect of it) is another I can&#x27;t believe that every candidate isn&#x27;t running with. The longer we wait to address the problem with meaningful change the worse of a future we guarantee. The worst outcome of heading down this path is  that we were wrong about some specific technology delivering us from the perils at hand - but then (like a broken unit test) we know that won&#x27;t work and can incorporate that knowledge into further endeavors.<p>Then there&#x27;s healthcare. The ACA was an excellent stepping stone - but it has to be that. Something to get us through so we can pull ourselves to the next step. The fact that so many Americans are soon to be required to have another insurance fee is ridiculous. This is the exact type of service that is the reason we pay taxes. I understand that some people view taxes as some illegal manifestation of government power - I just disagree with that entire sentiment. The proper role of taxes seems to be to cover the costs of burdens that we all collectively share. Every person in this nation needs healthcare to some degree. The health insurance market has already shown us that we can create a way to account for varying costs among individuals. That pattern falls into the existing pattern of our tax code pretty easily. Remove the middle man profiting off of our shared burden, replace it with the state, and reduce our burden slightly.<p>So there&#x27;s a nutshell of why I like Sanders. His platform appeals to me. It&#x27;s not some notion of &#x27;starving people and millionaires&#x27; - it&#x27;s that he wants to change the country in a way that I think is &#x27;better&#x27;.

Otherwise, don&#x27;t dismiss everything I said by claiming I am ignorant of some facts that you somehow failed to provide.<p>I am claiming that the problems <i>caused by</i> central banking are worse than the those supposedly <i>solved by</i> central banking.  Some people that are far more knowledgeable about economics than I have claimed that the greatest single cause of the Great Depression was the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.<p>The first panic of the 19th century was created or worsened by the Second Bank of the United States, a Hamiltonian central bank.  I loathe that guy.  They should have run him out of Philadelphia in a wheelbarrow in 1783.  If ever there was a man who loved money more than freedom, it was him.  Unfortunately, there are plenty of others like him, and <i>someone</i> would have tried multiple times to institute a central bank in the U.S.  After all, we got saddled with the Fed long after he was dead.<p>The second panic was caused mostly by massive fraud by a single financial company, but also the fear of legal slavery in the western territories.<p>The third was a combination of a bubble in railroads and the government ending the bimetallic standard, due to the 16:1 fix getting very unbalanced by silver mining.  And oh, look, another &quot;too big to fail&quot; bank overinvested in the railroads bubble and failed.  Again, it was Hamilton that fixed the silver:gold ratio at 15:1 in the first place instead of letting the market work.  That jerk.<p>The fourth?  Oh, shit.  <i>Another</i> railroads bubble, and <i>more</i> bank failures from overinvestment in it.  And <i>more</i> stupid government intervention in the silver market.<p>Did I miss any?  Investment bubbles and the silver standard, all the way.  Do I need to include the greenback crisis during the Civil War, where Lincoln paid for the Union war effort with inflationary fiat paper that went all the way up to one gold dollar costing 2.5 greenback dollars just a few scant years after the first print run?<p>And are you referring to the deflationary period from 1870 to 1890, which correlates with one of the strongest periods of sustained growth, industrialization, and prosperity in the history of the U.S.?  That deflation <i>in consumer prices</i> of about 2% per year?  The only economic problem there was that businesses had a harder time achieving <i>economic</i> profits--that is, a greater return than other possible investments--because more things were becoming commoditized.  If you wanted to make real money, you had to innovate and invest in useful capital.  ~Sounds like a real problem to me.~<p>Do you dispute that central banks pursue an explicit economic policy of routine monetary inflation to offset price deflation?  Do you dispute that this practice transfers wealth away from the producers of value in the economy to the printers of money, and those who get to spend that new paper first?  Do you dispute that any institution that is too big to fail is also too dangerous to continue to exist?<p>I have several clues about what I am talking about, and I haven&#x27;t needed to impugn your knowledge of this subject to do it.

People consume hits and toss them away for the next big thing all the time. The reasons independent game companies make these mistakes is that they conflate the mass appeal of their creation with a personal endorsement and assume anything they do in the future will be well-received. That&#x27;s rarely the case.<p>To be a successful player in the hits business, you have to be putting out new, formulaic stuff constantly, aware that some percentage of it will never make back its money, some may break even, and some will make a lot of money. This is what movie studios, record companies, and the successful game conglomerates do. As much as it may get tiresome to see the bi-annual CoD release break records, it matches the expected behavior perfectly.<p>But I digress. The direct answer to your question is pretty similar to what it always is: don&#x27;t grow too fast, don&#x27;t let it go to your head, and diversify. Personally, if I was in that situation, I think selling out to Activision or EA, who already have a functional hits apparatus, would be a path warranting serious consideration.

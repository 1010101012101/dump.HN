I prefer to quantify ""how often it makes writing harder"". It is more useful.<p>I think that types could make writing behaviour we want even easier. For example, you could use ""session types"" and be sure that your routers always understand each other. You can write complex algorithm while establishing its complex invariants in types and be sure you're correct.",1294099171

2065198,comment,2063203,2064591,0,0,bradleyland,,,"True and un-true. Yes, compiling software is at the heart of Unix programming. However, automation with regard to systems management is also at the heart of Unix programming. All these package management systems evolved to solve a very complex set of problems.<p>Compiling Ruby by hand is fine if you're running purpose-built VPSs, or cloud instances, or whatever the hip new phrase is, but for people who manage systems in the old world where 1 machine = 1 OS install and multiple, commingled services, it's an entirely different ballgame. Managers of these systems can't vet each and every interpreter on the system.<p>If someone in web integration walks through the door with a request for a Ruby interpreter to use a set of scripts for integrating the company's new website with the old back-end finance systems, the sysadmin's first stop is the stable package repository for their chosen distribution. Compiling by hand is yet another exception that must be tracked.<p>In enterprise environments were IT staff are outnumbered by a couple of orders of magnitude, exceptions are the proverbial ""death of a thousand cuts"". That is why failure to play ball with package management systems like apt is a poor choice. It will hurt the adoption of Ruby in many environments.",1294098918

You however, exactly reiterate my point, you didn't do any due diligence, just put certainly in italics. How about some facts instead?<p>Simply go to maps.google.com and search for Chicago, IL to New York, NY. Ok, 14 hours trip currently. Now, let's take a premise of 200 miles per hour. Now, tell me, can you travel 200mph anywhere in Chicago? Can you travel 200mph in Manhattan or anywhere close to it? No. Does your car contain enough gas to go 800 miles w/o stopping. Doubtful, especially at those speeds where your mpg is going to drop off drastically. Even assuming you could achieve 200mph sustained on the interstate you still have toll booths, traffic, weather, construction, curves, exits, onramps, and other real-world traffic scenarios to deal with. This is not a flying car, this car travels <i>on the ground like the rest of them</i>. At the absolute very best scenarios you are still looking at 5 hours to make the trip. I would argue a detailed scientific study on the feasibility of it would put the actual travel time closer to 7 hours even with a car that had a potential of 200mph.<p>Compare this to flying. The trip takes approximately 2 hours (please check any airline site so you can see for yourself). Let's be generous and add 1.5 hours on the before side and .5 hours on the after side to give us a rough approximation of total travel time from home to destination. That is a total of 4 hours.<p>The airplane wins hands down. Try thinking about the problem instead of going with assumptions.",1294096234

If you look at what happened with the last generation of consoles, everything but the PS3 had piracy before anyone had unsigned code running.  They ignored basically all of the security measures the consoles had implemented and attacked the optical drives firmware (with or without a modchip) and enabled 'backups'/piracy.  That basically leaves the PS3 as the one that had linux so the 'real hackers' were not working on it.<p>The PS3 itself is still not a good example of holding up against piracy until the hackers that wanted to run linux worked on it.  It was first broken for the reasons of piracy  (PSJailbreak) and was not done by the homebrew scene.  Actually, all of their work required and is based on already having code running on the PS3 using the pirate method.<p>So, what exactly is left to support the opinion that the homebrew people are smart, the piracy people are dumb, and if you do not support linux the homebrew people will make it work with the side effect of allowing piracy?  In every instance it is piracy that was first.

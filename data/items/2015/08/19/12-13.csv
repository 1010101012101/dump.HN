There are hundreds of different distros (the actual operating systems) with various degrees of security from being worse than Windows to having ultra-hardened kernels and user-spaces.<p>So from this point of view, I think it&#x27;s okay for &quot;Linux&quot; to be in multiple things at once, because it&#x27;s really pretty far from a &quot;single thing&quot;. The embedded versions of Windows seem to be more like 90% of the desktop version of Windows, and with the &quot;unification&quot; strategy of Windows 10 that&#x27;s probably more true than ever.<p>It&#x27;s debatable whether a kiosk PC that handles purchases should run Windows or not. What&#x27;s the worst that can happen there? The owner loses his records and possibly all of his money. It only affects him so he can choose whatever he likes. If he wants a less secure OS and he&#x27;s fine with the risk, that&#x27;s okay.<p>A voting machine (which is duplicated across a city or state or country) that&#x27;s not secure affects millions of people. Seems to me that it shouldn&#x27;t be using &quot;mainstream&quot; solutions that are the target of thousands of hackers.",1439989194

I imagine he could have turned that down, but I was insistent that he go so that his managers would not worry that his home life was impacting his work ethic. This is the Amazon way, after all. It was also one of the loneliest weeks of my life.<p>Amazon seems to have serious issues, but this one is on the employee/spouse. If you don&#x27;t protect your personal life/family time, how can you expect the company to?<p>I have young kids so I come in to the office early and don&#x27;t stay late too often so I can be home with them. I know some upper management probably look down on this, but expectations were clear when I was hired and my boss is OK with it.

The entire rise of that web property came on the backs of the notion that the site wasn&#x27;t for open marriages or more casual/relaxed notions about sex -- activities that many people engage in with little risk or concern -- but for people who wanted higher risk engagements, whether outside of their own relationship promises, or with parties acting outside of their own relationship promises.<p><i>because you suspect most of them might be &quot;guilty&quot; of the crime of &quot;marital infidelity&quot;</i><p>Scare quotes aside, moral compasses are personal and vary between us.

Child care facilities<p>Paternity leave is important to break the stereotype that mothers are the ones who have to sacrifice their careers to stay at home and care for the family. Widely available child care allow both parents to work as much as they need.<p>Anecdotal evidence from the senior staff I know here at the University says that male professors don&#x27;t have stay-at-home wives, and female professors have kids (with no noticeable difference compared to the rest of society).",1439985920

Omitting volatile can lead to nasty concurrency bugs (e.g. if the optimizer optimizes spin locks away). In the worst case, such bugs are extremely hard to reproduce (and thus debug) but lead to deadlocks and/or crashes in case they do occur.",1439985805

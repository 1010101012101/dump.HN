2976011,comment,2973404,2973404,1,0,dchurchv,,,"For <a href=""http://www.usermood.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usermood.com</a>, the most effective promotions (in order) have been:<p>1. Referrals, referrals, referrals. People loving the product has been by far the best way to promote it.  I don't mean affiliate sales (where people are incented to refer), just the garden variety friend telling a friend kind.  Nothing wrong with affiliates, of course, just a different thing.<p>2. SEO, to a smaller degree.  When people say ""SEO"", I usually roll my eyes, cause it's often a non-answer.  ""Get lots of traffic by writing great viral content"".  Which is essentially a harder problem than promoting your web app.  But having said that, at least from a search engine standpoint, it's something that pays dividends slowly, over time.<p>3. Banner ads/Google Ads - not particlarly effective, and something of a negative ROI investment, but this was good early on to get a feel for what kind of messaging worked best, and what sort of conversion rates were likely from direct ads.  So I'd suggest using these to learn, not as a sustainable customer acquisition strategy, unless your price point supports it.<p>4. Press/bloggers - we got some writeups by a few bloggers, which generated some short term traffic (usually a week or so), then fell off dramatically.  Again, good for SEO, and nice to get written about, but this hasn't been a consistent or reliable traffic source.<p>5. Web app directory/startup directory sites - good for short term launch traffic, generating awareness, etc., but these directories seem more noisy and less relevant over time.<p>Hope that helps.",1315522474

Our goal is to build a reputable, legal business that operates everywhere that gambling is legal. We have international payment providers and again, assume full responsibility for gambling, so developers have nothing to worry about, regardless of where their game is hosted and where their players are. We specifically cite that this is legal for US developers because gambling is 100% illegal in the US, so this is proof that use of our API does not violate local law.<p>That said, the legal issues surrounding this are definitely the primary concern among developers. We've been thinking of good ways to communicate this (other than company lawyers of the developing firm, which have given their employer the all clear every time thus far).

As someone who has worked in healthcare medical informatics for a long time I can report that errant spreadsheets with all sorts of data are floating around in virtually every medical institution.<p>Informatics in general and information security in particular are participants still new to the table at large healthcare institutions. It will take some time for policy to be formulated and yet more time still for it to be implemented organization wide. I really don't know if there is any one silver bullet here outside of prohibiting all data sharing, which, frankly is not possible.<p>There are so many different electronic information systems that people need to get data out of in all sorts of different formats, including paper, that the only real way I see this working is for vendors to force de-identification on export. See pioneering work by Sweeney[0] of CMU in this area. There are a number of systems that already do this but it is not the norm just yet. Not to mention the incalculable number of shadow systems that people use just to get their jobs done.<p>The overarching problem, imho, is simply that healthcare institutions have not adequately invested in their own internal technology teams. By and large, they are thinly resourced and overburdened. Whatever technical leadership does exist is simply not valued on the same level as top medical personnel with MD backgrounds. We will only begin to see a change when medical leadership accepts and invests in technology as an equal partner and not just a tool.<p>[0]<a href=""http://latanyasweeney.org/work/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latanyasweeney.org/work/index.html</a>",1315521062

2975892,comment,2975253,2975767,1,0,noduerme,,,"Hi. Okay, I guess I shot from the hip on these comments (chalk it up to someone who's spent a few years navigating the regulatory world of online gambling). I do think what you're trying to do makes for a pretty compelling proposition to games developers, and as you seem to be shouldering all the risk and cost involved, it would be difficult to refuse that kind of monetization without any research or overhead, especially the kind required to achieve the gold-standard UK license.<p>I do think $1.5M was a bit expensive for the license. Your T&C state: ""the Game Rules (which are different for each Game), which explain \nthe specific rules of the Game and are available on our Game Rules \npage [Note to the Gambling \nCommission: we propose to do this in a similar way to other \noperators, see for example <a href=""http://casino.ladbrokes.com/en/live-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://casino.ladbrokes.com/en/live-</a> \ndealer/help and <a href=""http://www.partycasino.com/games/more-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.partycasino.com/games/more-games/</a>. \nThe games (and, therefore, the rules) have not yet been finalised, \nbut in drafting the rules we will comply with the Fair and open \nprovisions of the Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice];""<p>This sounds like a pretty pricey pay-to-play for rules that aren't yet finalized (i.e. the assumption being that zero games are yet licensed on your platform). You could have done the same thing in Curacao for about $60k, or Malta for around $250k.<p>The question of whether there's an ecosystem like what you're describing, or whether that's something that can be astroturfed, is open, but depends on regs outside the EU and to a large extent individual jurisdictions' willingness to play ball, and the ability to move money rapidly through local payment options.<p>This still leaves open the question of what happens to a guy in Russia who's making money by hosting a game that's monetized through your site, with other Russian players betting on it. While the UK might have no problem with that, the Russian / Chinese / Vietnamese / Australian / Japanese / Norwegian / French / Italian / Greek / Israeli (and lots more) governments certainly do have problems with any casino that's not specifically licensed and regulated separately under their own jurisdictions. So a local developer in those markets may not be violating UK law or WTO regulations, but could still be in deep trouble with their own local law enforcement. If Her Majesty's MI6 is going to spring rebel iphone devs out of a Tajik prison for that $1.5M, then it was well worth it =)<p>As with all things online-gambling, there's a murkiness in the system, because one country's laws state that doing X is legal in another country, and that this license permits it. Likewise, a Costa Rican data processing company is fully within its legal rights to run gambling in the United States, as far as Costa Rican law is concerned. We know how that usually works out.<p>I think -- and I'm not trying to be harsh, because there may well be a market for this (although the HN crowd probably isn't hip to how or why exactly, and you'd do better on a gambling forum) -- but essentially you've prepaid for prestige by the truck-load and are hoping a market exists to rent a piece of it. It'll be interesting to see if it works. I think it's hard for any company to justify the price of a UK license w/o a huge volume in sportsbetting already coming through the door. What you're potentially tapping into here is an unknown quantity, and everything (legally) is in flux right now around the world, so it's an interesting time to try it.<p>I wish you the best, and apologize for coming off as rude. I've got my doubts, but look forward to seeing your progress.",1315520058

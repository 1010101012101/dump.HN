Also taking Linear Algebra, which is just amazing, btw.<p>Others have suggested Coursera, but so far, I don&#x27;t think it is prime time for those who are really serious. I&#x27;ve found that many of the classes are somewhat watered down and I feel as though I am reviewing concepts I already know instead of learning. Too bad there is no mention of EdX here. Their classes are much more intense, complete, and CS-heavy than anything I&#x27;ve seen from Coursera. The grading system is far superior as well. I wish EdX had more love, but maybe the problem is that it is <i>too</i> intense.<p>A note one SICP. There is so much in that book and it is certainly worth every moment. Just expect to grind long time with it. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I really learned from the book until I started making my own projects.

6346360,comment,6341785,6345829,1,0,troels,,,"Depends on your perspective, I guess. The difference between not knowing how to program and learning, say, ruby is a fair bit larger than the difference between knowing how to program in php and learning ruby.<p>Take php and ruby (two languages I happen to have used a fair bit both). If you&#x27;re writing your typical web app, you&#x27;d probably use mysql for a database. That&#x27;s the same. You talk http to the client - same. You want to parse xml? Probably going to use libxml underneath the covers. And so on. So yes, there&#x27;s different libraries for the two, but there&#x27;s also a lot that is shared.<p>As for different philosophies, they are both pretty much imperative languages. Php has a simpler object model than ruby and ruby has some fp features, such as co-routines, but by and large you write programs in the same style.<p>And different purposes? I&#x27;ll dispute that. You pretty much use both languages for more or less the same things.<p>Mind you - I&#x27;m not saying they are exactly the same. Clearly they&#x27;re not. But I&#x27;m saying the difference is in the nuances.<p>And while I do agree that ruby is a nicer language than php, I think the trend of treating it as if it was toxic is completely out of proportions.",1378583793

6346351,comment,6340356,6344468,2,0,thwarted,,,"<i>But the larger context of this move was doing more with less. And Nginx just working with 4 instances and serving just as much, with a reduced average latency of page load, justified the move.</i><p>&quot;More with less&quot; here is a judgement call.  You&#x27;ve increased the number of processes and subsystems that need to be managed (nginx + php_fpm), which is more.  You&#x27;ve increased the context switching when dynamic requests need to be passed to another process and proxied through nginx.  The communication between the frontend web server and php_fpm needs to be serialized in some fashion, so you&#x27;re now incurring a greater than 1x cost in processing and parsing things like HTTP headers and the request (serializing and deserializing the data to pass that between the processes). It seems you&#x27;re ignoring the actual cost of running dynamic PHP code because the cost has been moved out of the &quot;web server&quot;, the thing that listens on port 80, and into something that isn&#x27;t considered &quot;a web server&quot;, but this is just a change in bookkeeping.<p>Do you know where that reduced average latency is coming from?  Is it because nginx is serving static assets that would tie up an apache worker that <i>could be</i> running/serving PHP in apache?  If so, you can do the same thing by offloading all your static asset serving to another server (or a completely external CDN, which has other extremely beneficial client-side advantages too) using apache too.  That is, the choice of software here isn&#x27;t as big a win as presented, it&#x27;s the architecture of the ecosystem that is the big influence.<p>It&#x27;s great that you found something that works better for your workload, and it&#x27;s appropriate to use what works and not get bogged down in why all the time.  But the way you&#x27;ve presented it doesn&#x27;t indicate well that all the causes and effects are completely understood.  And I think this ends up giving Apache a bad rap.",1378583692

6346301,comment,6345730,6345730,36,0,s_q_b,,,"Ah, this is great. I first learned assembly programming to modify one of my favorite video games, Earthbound. To my surprise, the game was a cult classic, and extensive efforts had been made to develop tools to modify every aspect of the game.<p>As part of that effort, I learned 65816 assembly, a 16-bit descendant of the 6502. The day I modified the code to add a run button, thereby eliminating one of the most annoying aspects of the original game, I was ecstatic.<p>I checked back on the community, PK Hack, a few months ago. The level of development was amazing. Virtually the entire game was mapped, byte for byte. There&#x27;s a sophisticated visual map editor, and a cross-platform data editor.<p>The coolest part was to see a tool I envisioned, for which I developed a lackluster proof of concept, come to full fledged fruition.<p>Earthbound, as it turns out is a rather uniquely developed game. The second game in the Mother series, which is enormously popular in Japan, ran into severe difficulties. Co-developed by HAL and Ape, the coding was rather schizophrenic from the outset. Eventually large parts were rewritten by  Shigesato Itoi himself, as the legend goes. The end result is  a spaghetti soup of code generated by some type of macro system, compiled from some variant of C, and written in assembly itself.<p>To manage this complexity, many of the events in the game used a text scripting language that abstracted away the underlying routines. This scripting was a series of in-line hex sequences, each its own set of instructions for how sprites, character entities, etc. were supposed to act when the code appeared, which we termed &quot;control codes.&quot;<p>12-year-old me, supremely confident in his abilities and utterly lacking in all technical knowledge, suggested we build a scripting language on top of the control codes so that manual text editing would be eased. The result was a slapdash Visual Basic job that used a BASIC like syntax for simple substitutes for control codes. Of course at the time, I had no knowledge of parsers, DSLs, language design, or really basic computational knowledge. The result was a wreck.<p>But that wreck stuck in someone&#x27;s mind. Years later, after obtaining his computer science degree, one of the hackers with whom I had worked implemented a full-fledged language on top of the control codes.<p>In retrospect, I don&#x27;t remember the vast amounts of time I ostensibly wasted learning an obsolete game&#x27;s design and building tools with which to modify it. I remember the heady moment when you suddenly <i>knew</i> how a data field worked, or after a whole night of hunting with a hex editor the data you wanted appeared, and the sheer giddy thrill of discovering new knowledge and seeing it implemented <i>right there</i>, like a physical mark on the world.<p>I recognize this has been a long and tangential exposition, so if you&#x27;ve read any of it thank you for indulging me. Another glimpse of that low level assembly, like the smell of home after a very long time away, brings back so many vivid memories.",1378582938

From running a startup accelerator off the beaten path (in Hong Kong), I can tell you that the startups that got the most out of it were those that were coachable, social (but not too social), kept in contact by asking for help when needed, and maintained momentum. I wrote about this here: <a href=""http://startupsunplugged.com/startup-programs/four-simple-things-that-make-a-better-accelerator-experience/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupsunplugged.com/startup-programs/four-simple-th...</a><p>There is a lot of hype out there about startup accelerators. And overall, it&#x27;s really early to know how things will go with the many different programs that exist. Some of the data that&#x27;s out there is just inaccurate.

That and being noticeably stronger companies.<p>In any program, at some point you&#x27;ll probably get feedback that you don&#x27;t want to hear. You could either reject it outright and keep doing whatever you were doing before, or you could consider why you were given the feedback (whether or not you agree with it), or you could be open-minded and willing to accept that you don&#x27;t know everything yet. Use the mentor network but don&#x27;t fall victim to mentor whiplash (where you get pulled in 100 different directions by mentors providing opinion-based advice). You should know your business and customers better than anyone else, so take all advice with the understanding that you will have a different perspective than other people.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to give you really specific actionable items that you request, because everyone&#x27;s situation is different.

The need for proper management of women without prenatal care, including HBsAg testing at the time of admission for delivery and administration of the first dose of vaccine to infants <12 hours of birth, is underscored by the higher prevalence of HBsAg seropositivity among these women than among women who are screened prenatally (12). Even when maternal HBsAg testing does occur, certain infants of HBsAg-positive mothers do not receive postexposure immunoprophylaxis because of testing errors and lapses in reporting of test results (13), and infants of women with unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery often do not receive a birth dose of vaccine (14).<p>> Children who are not infected at birth remain at risk from long-term interpersonal contact with their infected mothers. In one study, 38% of infants who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who were not infected perinatally became infected by age 4 years (64). In addition, children living with any chronically infected persons are at risk for becoming infected through percutaneous or mucosal exposures to blood or infectious body fluids (e.g., sharing a toothbrush, contact with exudates from dermatologic lesions, contact with HBsAg-contaminated surfaces). HBV transmission rates to susceptible household contacts of chronically infected persons have varied (range: 14%60%) (65,66). High rates of infection also have been reported among unvaccinated long-term residents of institutions for the mentally handicapped (67,68), and, in rare instances, person-to-person transmission has been reported in child care settings (69,70).<p>Also, the vaccine is made from virus capsid protein expressed in Baker&#x27;s yeast. There&#x27;s no infectious material at all, making it a very safe vaccine. (Unlike the earlier Hep-B vaccine which had a danger of including viral DNA should something go wrong during purification.)",1378580826

6346132,comment,6345520,6345520,1,0,keyme,,,"The only reason not to roll your own VPN on some private server, is the lack of deniability. The dedicated IP of the server is tied directly to your name/credit card. \nA public VPN, while also tied to your banking info, usually acts as a NAT. Multiple clients exit the VPN given the same source IP address. If no logs are kept (as promised on most services), no one can (accurately) tie an IP address to your name.\nI personally use the BTGuard VPN for this reason.",1378580605

And I&#x27;m still frustrated with it.<p>Having not done user tests, I can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s objectively worse, but it is certainly worse for me. They&#x27;ve totally broken my use of starred places. Search is much slower, especially doing a new search to replace the current one. You can no longer leave navigation running while doing a search. The screen where they offer you route options is useless to me; it gives me 1-3 indistinguishable options, and I always just click on the first to see what it&#x27;s talking about. The menu button frequently doesn&#x27;t do anything; the search button never does.<p>I would pay them cash money to give me the old version back.",1378580541

The culprit seems to be less about calories and exercise than about eliminating carbs, sugar and processed foods.<p>There is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence to support this, and I can just add that my wife and I started on it nine weeks ago and we have never felt better. I even dropped a few pounds although I didn&#x27;t really need to. We also supplement with probiotics to ensure that we maintain good levels of healthy bacteria in the gut, which is where much of our immune system functions.",1378580533

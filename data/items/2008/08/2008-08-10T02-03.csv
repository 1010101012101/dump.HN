272124,comment,271920,271951,0,0,angstrom,,,"Agreed. The cost of implementing such an open system is negligible compared to the cost of securing it. You can harden a system as much as you want, but the business case for doing so is nil until it becomes a problem. At 0.000000003 of rides are being stolen it doesn't make sense.<p>While the security tzars are focused on the electronic hackers just having fun the majority of losses are probably coming from kids who jump the turn styles or go through 2 at a time.",1218336744

A choice snippet:<p><i>Called Alter Ego, this software basically takes advantage of blend shapes to copy facial idiosyncrasies and produce emotive life-like 3D character animations.</i><p>Wow, that's so insightful!  Could you copy-n-paste more of the press release, please?",1218336710

Having screens would prevent rubber necking on the other side of the highway (with a large cement barrier in between).<p>Also, I think you can do a lot to the screen itself to increase driver safety. Make it 15' high and entirely yellow/black diagonal stripes and it'll catch driver's attention and get them to slow down. TV and radio educational ads can help too.",1218336410

""Perl sucks!  Javascript 2 is dictated by politics, I think.  I don't have any facts to back that up, but this is a blog.  Finally, I dislike static typing.  The end.""<p>Maybe I'm just in a bad mood, but this article sucks.",1218336080

272112,comment,271873,272094,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, I've read some of it (had to put it down because it was simply too painful to think about so much wasted effort).  I once followed the project with interest.  I was on the mailing lists, read the docs, checked out the early code, etc.  I perhaps take it too personally because I did expect great things from the Chandler team.  I just expected those great things five years ago.",1218335255
272111,comment,271873,272098,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"No editing.  I'm not known for being subtle in my criticism or avoiding taking blame for the things I say.  As you say, I don't think I was avoiding taking any responsibility for my criticism, and I'd welcome arguments to the contrary if anyone would like to defend Chandler.  (And note that I'm not calling the developers idiots or incompetent, and never would...we all probably accept that they're smart folks who lacked leadership and specific vision.)",1218335147
272110,comment,271827,272105,0,0,brandonkm,,,"Agreed, I think we've been seeing a slight preview of this.  The recent google acquisition of lively was what brought the whole concept of virtual worlds to my attention. I'm sure that platform will serve as a testground for some ideas. I also think that possibly social networking will move into this space as well (think friends meeting up in virtual spaces) and advertising will definitely follow.",1218334974

You'll more commonly see such systems referred to as ""virtual private servers"" or VPSes.<p>Heck, this very page is #3 on Google for ""linux slice"" which shows how little the term is used ;-)",1218334089

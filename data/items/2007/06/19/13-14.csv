It takes a long time and a couple of revisions to write a good polished essay (or blog post) I think for creating a podcast you write down what you want to talk about in point form and then you talk and elaborate on these ideas.",1182260503

He has a term for these people, ""level 5 leaders"", which to me sounds like some kind of weird cult mumbo jumbo, but his point is well taken.<p>Even The Economist has had a number of editorials lately saying that pay should better respect performance.

For example, before I went to MIT I saw a NYT article about students protesting the proposed removal of the pass/no credit system for the following freshman year.  The article slanted it as if the students were selfishly interested in not getting grades.  It doesn't take a domain expert to realize that if you're an MIT student now, you won't be a freshman next year, and could not be affected by the removal of pass/no credit.  Students were objecting because they felt it would have a detrimental effect on others.",1182258532

Incidentally, Gaikai has an office in Berlin, according to <a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gaikai"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gaikai</a> and their main office is in Orange County, just outside of LA.<p>EDIT: Gaikai&#x27;s CTO, Andrew Gault departed some time in the same year as Sony takeover.<p><i></i><i>EDIT 2</i><i></i>: The CEO of Gaikai said in an interview,“To give you my real take on it, I honestly can’t think of a future for the console companies that don’t include cloud gaming at some point. They can hold out as long as they want to, but at some point, you don’t want to be the console that can’t do this. To some extent, I expect all three of them will have this. But we have to stay Switzerland – we can’t end up competing with anyone. I would like to see all of them use Gaikai, that’s my fantasy, right? It would be cool.”

But since virtually everyone is a progressive, attendees hardly notice, like a fish not noticing water. Consider, for example, this egregious talk, which can reasonably be summarized as &quot;the liberal arts have done a good job at decreasing the relative proportion of white men, and we in technology should learn from their example&quot;:<p><a href=""http://railsconf.com/program#prop_842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsconf.com/program#prop_842</a><p>Or take a look at this one:<p><a href=""http://selfconference.org/sessions#session_33"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selfconference.org/sessions#session_33</a><p>When &quot;tech&quot; conferences include talks like &quot;Empathy & Gender Diversity: AMA,&quot; I&#x27;m afraid the pattern is clear.<p>We in tech are going to have to make a decision about whether we want this process to continue. It&#x27;s already rather badly violating some cherished liberal principles, such as the policy of offering need-based scholarships to worthy recipients, but <i>only to members of favored underrepresented groups</i>. In other words, poor white and Asian men are out of luck. This policy is being pursued by organizations such as the Y Combinator–backed Recurse Center [1] and by the Strange Loop conference itself [2]. Perhaps we need a fork: in addition to the current events, with their trigger warnings and diversity agendas, maybe we need events that say, &quot;This event is open to anyone. We are all adults here, so if you hear something that upsets you, leave the room or take it in stride. And this is a tech event, so please leave your politics at the door.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.recurse.com/diversity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.recurse.com/diversity</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.thestrangeloop.com/opportunity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestrangeloop.com/opportunity.html</a>",1433552149

They then seem to add a little on to that in the knowledge that you&#x27;ll be better off working with them. Provided they offer you sufficiently more to overcome the bother of moving, they need not offer you what your work is worth.<p>Whether you offer them a value that you&#x27;d be happy with or not, you still haven&#x27;t answered the question.<p>> Not telling them is evading, plain and simple. You can sugar coat and wordsmith it all you want, but you&#x27;re not fooling anyone even with limited intelligence you are evading the question.<p>Most people don&#x27;t seem to be trying to evade it. At least not in a &quot;I&#x27;ll say this clever thing and then they won&#x27;t even notice!&quot; sense.<p>They will notice. The answer is to provide somewhere more constructive for the conversation to go than:<p>&quot;None of your business....&quot;<p>&quot;....&quot;<p>You&#x27;re <i>not</i> obligated to satisfy someone&#x27;s curriosity. Especially not when they have interests contrary to your own. You don&#x27;t want someone to know something, don&#x27;t tell them. Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be an ass about it though.<p>Still. If you feel that they might be decieved, you could always state it before the constructive part of the discussion. Something like:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not going to disclose my current sallary because it would constitute a fixpoint for the negotiation. I feel we&#x27;d have a better chance of finding an arrangement we can both be happy with if we talk about what we can both do for each other and establish a compensation package based on that.&quot;",1433552117
9669126,comment,9663203,9668331,0,0,bane,,,"At the time it was <i>very</i> crowded (until everybody closed up shop). Most of our customers had an incumbent vendor of some sort and it was quite difficult to get them to switch. Most of the vendors tried to get customer lock-in through customized integration services or proprietary formats or some such, so the software was often the cheap part of the purchase.<p>I think the real challenge though was customers who put very non-technical users in positions as &quot;analysts&quot;. Everybody wanted very powerful software, but the end-users simply weren&#x27;t prepared for the rigors of what these days has turned into the &quot;Data Science&quot; field. For example, most end-user analysts don&#x27;t understand the difference between a csv file, and a pdf file with a table printed on it, and an Excel spreadsheet.<p>Most of our users were smart soft-science types, and their organizations had collected lots of data but simply didn&#x27;t have the education or experience to understand the difficulties with dealing with the data, coming up with strategies to analyze it, knew what was in their data, the quality of it, what questions it could answer, or even how to formulate answerable questions.<p>Up to fairly recently, the state of the art in their fields was to read reports and summarize and draw some conclusion based on their reading.<p>Even up through the technical sides of the organization, they didn&#x27;t have a good grasp of how to build and manage systems that could service these users. High level requirements like &quot;users need analytic software&quot; would often end up as purchase decisions of the wrong product. Or sometimes IT security was such that the software would never be installed!<p>It was frustrating because the separation of expertise on the user-side and technical side was such a wide gulf and neither side really understood the other.<p>On the other-hand, it was a great opportunity to try to educate the customers and educate them towards your product. I found it very high-touch pre and post-sales --sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way.<p>Most of the incumbent software had highly complex back ends, was not as turnkey as they had claimed (hence all the integration work) and the user-side provided very limited functionality...usually providing functionality on the order of a very basic MS-Excel and MS-Powerpoint combined.<p>On the other hand, in some highly specialized organizations, the incumbent software had decades of work behind it and was kind of like Photoshop in terms of complexity, even if most of the users didn&#x27;t use most of the things it did. Features had just sort of aggregated out of control. However, the features they <i>did</i> use were often very sophisticated and modeled carefully on that kind of specialist workflow (even if a better workflow would have been technically easy to build).<p>We worked very hard to provide tooling the customer could integrate themselves if they wanted, but it would work reasonably well right out of the box. We even provided a pretty nice visual data flow development environment for wiring up databases and transforming data and such. We were mostly successful as many of our long-time customers didn&#x27;t ask us to do much other work for them. We had a few that paid us for some custom development or integration, but our goal was to try to build a tool that didn&#x27;t require that. Even though the company has been gone for years, I&#x27;m aware of a few organizations that <i>still</i> use our software on a day-to-day basis because we succeeded in these goals and the high-TCO of the &quot;winning&quot; company in our space has dissuaded them switching.<p>It&#x27;s too bad everybody else got chased out of the market, because I know of at least one of those old customers who&#x27;s ready to upgrade to something newer, but there&#x27;s just nobody in our space alive anymore except for one.<p>I think that if we had been flush with VC money we would have pursued some different strategies, but you often have to size your offerings based on your resources.<p>A lot of what I experience isn&#x27;t too relevant anymore anyways, the market and technology have changed too much. These days many organizations simply solve these problems by hiring data scientists (usually cross-educated in the required field and CS/CE/DS or something) and getting them some hardware to play on.",1433552088

I&#x27;m working on an finger-drawing-infinite-canvas-DAW-ish sort of thing for iPad that makes sketching out musical ideas a whole lot easier — especially if you can&#x27;t play a musical instrument very well. I feel there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of ways for non-instrumentalists to experiment with music in an environment with a tight, intuitive feedback loop, which makes music a daunting field to get into as compared to other creative fields like writing or painting. This app isn&#x27;t for kids, though; I&#x27;m making it largely for my own use, since I have a ton of musical ideas but none of the instrumental chops to iterate on them or put them into practice. Everything runs on MIDI, and I even added support for microtonal scales the other day (via .scl files), just &#x27;cause. Dunno when it&#x27;ll be out, but I&#x27;m hoping in a few months. After that, I expect to keep updating and expanding it for as long as I use it myself, which should be many years.<p>Early demo: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra8OvnoxKQw</a><p>(Sorry about the dissonance, I was just putting down notes at random!)",1433548833

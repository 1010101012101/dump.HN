720226,comment,719977,720205,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Try this:<p>Functional programming languages have an underlying model based on <i>function composition</i> (with one argument functions, etc.). To the extent that they have arguments with multiple functions, etc., it's ultimately just syntactic sugar and optimizing for common cases - While nobody generally writes the low-level ""lambda calculus virtual machine language"" stuff by hand outside of academic papers or bootstrapping, Scheme's ""let"" is implemented in terms of lambda at compile-time. (Scheme without set! is representative.)<p>Imperative languages have a fundamental underlying model of cells in memory and sequential operations that modify them, branch based on them, etc., including an instruction pointer specifying where instructions are currently read. (C is representative.)<p>Intuitively (and without busting out the Greek letters): compare languages for which functions are a list of <i>expressions</i>, and return the value of the last, versus languages for which functions are a list of <i>statements executed sequentially</i>, the last of which can optionally return a value. A lot of other issues are ultimately due to how that choice directs default behavior. Even when a language has the amenities to borrow the other's tools, the defaults channel common usage.<p>Likewise: Relational databases are ultimately based on the relational model, even when parts of SQL fill in conceptually irrelevant details for sake of performance; Prolog is based on backtracking and Horn clauses, and well-structured Prolog can be reasoned about in terms of them, even when cuts are used to avoid wandering about needlessly in known dead ends. The ultimate result would (eventually) be the same. Both models are fundamentally different from pure functional or imperative programming, as well, and the languages built on them are as different as Erlang is from Smalltalk.<p>I'm self-taught and not a mathematician, so I couldn't give a really exhaustive or formal analysis of the distinction -- probably the best way to understand it (and learn quite a bit else, PS) is to work through the exercises in SICP and CTM. The second chapter of SICP includes Church encoding (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html...</a>), among many other things. SICP covers functional programming quite well, but CTM makes the fundamental differences between the different programming models and their strengths and weaknesses clearer.<p>You can use functional idioms in imperative languages, but they may lack features such as tail call optimization or garbage collection, which mean that you're working at cross-purposes to both the semantics of the language and the cases for which its implementation has been optimized. Whether this means attempting to do so is actually infeasible (e.g. stack overflows in Python) or just slow and/or verbose depends on the language. Likewise, modeling problems in functional languages that are intrinsically better-suited to imperative languages can be messy and confusing.<p>(OO is a completely different direction, but as people have wildly inconsistent ideas of what it actually refers to, I'm not going there.)",1248379135

Not everyone needs to be expert at everything, but on the other hand ignorance creates enormous barriers to entry - illiteracy being an extreme example.<p>If we focus on educating people as consumers and then gave them discretion on which subjects they are sufficiently interested in to become producers, we might gain more. for example, politicians and marketers abuse statistics on a regular basis, secure in the knowledge that the average person has little statistic knowledge.

It wasn't an original idea of mine - I got the idea from a similar lesson in my own high school english class (UK).",1248376435
720155,comment,719416,719416,0,0,zwieback,,,"I'm working on a startup-like project within a very large company. A couple of trends I've seen:<p>- Unless you can show that your project will make the company more money in the first couple years than putting it into the bank it's a no go. We're told that it's cheaper to wait for another small company to succeed and then just go and buy that.<p>- We have IP, great labs, technicians and vendor relations for the technologies we're in already but it's hard to expand into totally new areas because we wouldn't be utilizing the existing resources. The usual answer is outsourcing but it's very hard to find good help when you don't quite know what you're doing yet.<p>- We had an official innovation funnel for a few years where employee ideas could gain some traction but that approach was abandoned in favor of the few-big-bets approach. I can't honestly say why the funnel failed but after a short while we called it the ""funnel of death"" since the financial types would never accept the business plans. At some point we tried to keep our side projects out of the funnel hoping we'd get far enough on our own.<p>We make mostly hardware so we're a lot less nimble than pure SW shops but some of the same trends surely apply.",1248376424

Final Cut was a spinoff of that when the developer left for Macromedia, which was in turn split between Apple and Adobe (FC & Flash, respectively): <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2009/05/11/supermac-war-story-x-the-video-spigot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2009/05/11/supermac-war-story-x-the-vi...</a><p>Now you're right about Apple's price cutting, and it's more obvious how this drove down the cost of video - but on the music side while you had ProTools at the extreme high end and Logic at the prosumer price, over on the (post-Atari) PC side you had very aggressive competition from Steinberg (Cubase), then Cakewalk, and ultimately a host of others - not to mention trackers. eMagic had a big first-mover advantage in their price space,  but competitors were really eroding that with a combination of pricing and ease-of-use. I personally think EMagic would have gone bust within 2 years if they hadn't been able to fall into Apple's arms.<p>To be fair to Apple, they <i>were</i> very smart to focus on things like high bus bandwidth and high-resolution hardware timers which are <i>de rigeur</i> for this sort of work. Wintel was able to play catch-up in large part because of the rise of electronic music, where things like hardware latency and so forth were less critical.",1248375618

This, however does not take into consideration what is cause and what is effect.<p>For instance, if you take 50 companies and let them follow this advice (from the article)<p>- Bet the company<p>- Think big<p>- Prescribe change<p>- Reach for the sky<p>- Set your sites high<p>- Commit to change<p>what you will see 5 years later is that 40 of the companies have gone bankrupt because they bet the company and reached for the sky. But all that is apparent to the casual observer is the 10 companies that have success, and all that is observed is their often risky strategies that have led them to their success.<p>To drive the point home: In 1982 Tom Peters and Robert Waterman did exactly this, they investigated a number of successful companies and saw what they had done that noone else was doing. And they concluded that this was what you should do if you wanted to be successful, and thereby completely ignored cause and effect. Their studies were published in the business bestseller ""in search of excellence"".<p>And what if you look at the companies that they investigated today? Many are bankrupt, and many are in financial trouble. Only a few are doing really well.<p>One of the companies that ""did all the right things"" was Atari.<p>This was actually one of the primary reasons I left business school. I basically thought ""these guys have no idea what they are talking about"" - and a lot of them still don't...",1200841108

101226,comment,101063,101063,0,0,mixmax,,,"I believe that a big part of embracing new tehcnologies is time. The crowd that creates new technology are the first movers, and immediately jump at something that makes their life easier/better/cheaper/faster. What most innovators fail to see is that it takes time for normal people to change their behavior and start doing something different - even if it has obvious advantages.<p>I wrote about it here: <a href=""http://www.maximise.dk/blog/2005/04/why-bubble-burst.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maximise.dk/blog/2005/04/why-bubble-burst.html</a>",1200839838

101223,comment,101198,101198,0,0,mixmax,,,"It always bothers me when I see statistics in the news that don't point to their sources. Especially since the most outrageous ones (such as the one quoted in the article) are the ones that tend to get blown up and carried by other news outlets. This has a tendency to promote the poorly researched stories (since they are the ones more likely to come up with preposterous claims based on bad statistics) and noone seems to care much that the underlying assumptions are shaky at best. I see countless examples of this every week.<p>Some major news outlets should start doing a bit more research on their stories, and maybe hire a statistician.",1200839323

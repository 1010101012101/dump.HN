Your story should tell me why, if I choose to have a discussion with you, our conversation is going to be really engaging and interesting, and how it will convince me that you're the right person to do the job.<p>Some characteristics of engaging interviews:<p>- They're with people with people who are smart.  Show your smart on our resume either by listing academic achievements if you're just out of school, or by describing hard problems you've solved.<p>- The candidate has done something interesting in their previous experience.  Your resume gives you the opportunity to tell me what the most interesting thing you've done is.  If I agree, you'll get to tell me all about it.<p>- The candidate has enough experience to get through my technical questions in style.  I think this is less about knowing specific buzzwords (at least for how I interview), and more about having solid fundamentals and good hands-on experience.

It could be defensive, it could be an attempt to capitalize on a system by a competitor, or a pre-emptive move to stop competitors from doing this. They may use it in a specific niche product or they may end up using it, but there is rarely a direct correlation between a patent and a plan as the OP seems to claim with his title.

903406,story,,,1,0,moron4hire,"Ask HN: Out of the frying pan and into...",,"I recently left a relatively process-heavy client and have started at a company with a very ad-hoc ""process"". The move was primarily motivated by wanting to change geographical location and reduce work-related stress. A significant salary bump was also involved, but I wasn't hurting before, so it was more of an enabling factor to pay for the cost of living bump for the move.<p>With my previous position, the client was--it seemed at the time--very pedantic about what sort of details should be included in project scope documents, requirements documents, functional design documents, technical design documents, test plans, and deployment plans. What seemed like a 6 month-long hinderance to a 1-month long programming effort eventually grew on me. When everything was fully specified, everything finished without any major hitches, and when there were hitches, there was a failure in the process to blame, instead of just lumping it all on me. I learned a lot about analysis along the way and had a lot of great successes near the end of my stay with the client.<p>The client liked me very much and didn't want me to leave. They even offered a permanent position, but were not willing to give me a salary bump of any kind (they were actually asking me to take a $10K hit, when they would be saving about $100K after getting rid of my employer's consulting fee). Being in the construction equipment manufacturing industry, they were hurt pretty hard by the real estate bust, had massive layoffs throughout all departments, with the resultant huge bump in expectations for productivity. I was the technical lead in a team of 2.5 (1 manager, 1 technical (me), and 1 part-time support person) on a project that should have had a team at least seven (I estimated 1 manager, 1 technical lead, 2 programmers, 2 support people, and 1 tester). I provided other services for the client, including interviewing potential new hires, iterating process policy, and performing analysis for other projects in emergency situations.<p>I wanted to move from the rural central PA to Philadelphia, and I also wanted a higher salary to better reflect my growing responsibility from rank-programmer to all-around-analyst. I got in contact with a recruiter, outlined what I was looking for, and several months later he called me back with a ""fit"".<p>There is a saying that you ""don't know what you've got until it's gone"". Whereas my previous position was a high-pressure environment because we actually had more work than we could handle, the pressure and stress at this new position seem more focused around poorly managed expectations for productivity in the face of next-to-non-existent project documentation. Most of my time so far has been spent on bug fixes, fixes for bugs that should have never been introduced if a proper development process--hell, ANY development process--had been followed. Everything I've done so far has been specifically what I told the recruiter I wanted to avoid.<p>I did get to move to the location I wanted; I'm half an hour from center-city Philadelphia and 5 minutes from some of my best friends. It's a 3-month contract-to-hire, but while I'm on the contract I have more than my desired salary, recent talk (after my butt was in the chair, of course) has indicated that I won't get my minimum requirement once I convert over to a permanent position. Benefits appear essentially identical to my previous position, which is to say ""adequate, not great"".<p>Okay, that's the long of it. I'm just so confused right now. I don't know what to do about this new position. I don't want to move ""back home"", but as a last resort I know my old client would take me back in a heart-beat. I'm afraid of a situation similar to the last time I was in an ad-hoc development environment: getting constantly blamed for bugs that are actually business logic errors due to lack of spec. Is there a way to manage expectations in such an environment? Should I go back to the recruiter? Should I do it now or after the 3 month contract is nearly up? I have contacts in a number of different places that I could probably end up with a position very quickly, but again, not doing what I want to do and not in the city I want to be. I want to do commercial software development, I'm tired of the malarky that comes with consulting work. Am I stuck in consulting work? Am I just whining?",1256571814

When you want to study the effects of natural evolution on human populations (really any population) you're forced to do a wide, long observational study including as many subjects and cofactors as possible. Since that's pretty nearly prohibitively expensive, you're really better off just seeing if you can get someone else's data just like Stearns did.<p>This data specifically doesn't have a lot of power to generalize to populations outside of Framington. Additionally, making bold future predictions is not something that scientists like to show one another, just news reporters. What it does, though, is show support to already leading theories. Stearns is quoted in an NPR interview saying the real point that ""the result that we have here is no surprise to any evolutionary biologist. It's exactly what we expected to see.""<p>No matter what the possible confounding factors may have been, the fact that when decent statistical methods were used to control for and limit just to correlations that could be feasibly tied to evolutionary processes the remaining effect fits the predictions developed by theories made prior to this result means that the data provided some interesting justification.<p>Stearns also is quoted in that the study attempted to ""lift the level of discussion and get everybody on the same page."" It's not groundbreaking, it's just some solid human-based evidence for things long predicted. The hype is centered around news stories which pick up on the wide future predictions (an offhand, light comment in the interview) and the philosophical/moral implications of evolution playing police state on our futures (which is a suitable target for arguments about statistical weakness and Stearns himself brings up that only about 5% of the variability was involved in this evolution trend).<p>All the study really says is that, yes, like we thought, somewhere deep inside human cultural motion is a definite seed of evolutionary guidance. It takes 60 years of intense observation to see it, but it almost certainly exists and plays some tiny role.<p>Which is kind of a boring news story.<p>[NPR interview: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114081469&ft=2&f=510221"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1140814...</a>]",1256570969

If you list things like ""interfaced with QA"", ""participated in planning with product management"", or ""used JSPs and Servlets to write web-based mail client"", you will not stand out much from other applicants. You should focus on (preferably quantifiable) results. Examples: ""designed and implemented QA testing plan that raised code coverage of a 100 KLOC email service from 18% for 63%"", ""wrote web-based mail client that handles 8000 users and up to 50 requests per second"", etc. Try to show what you have achieved, not what you have worked on.<p>Along with making your resume stronger, specific points often help guide your interview predictably. I have 1-2 bullet points that everyone asks about, and it's great to have a few interview questions that you know you will ace.",1256569406

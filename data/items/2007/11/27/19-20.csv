All you need is one: ""X purchased [porn dvd] from Y"" in your feed and all your 'friends' are gonna laugh at you and ridicule you and it will leave you with sour feeling in your mouth. Or they'll criticize your tastes and judge you by the crap you buy. <p>Exodus from FB has already begun.",1196193188
84004,comment,83930,84000,0,0,jotto,,,"i think the trend is only with the tech-crowd, we'll see if this spreads to non-techy people, but i think the myspace crowd enjoys where facebook is at right now - self expression, maximum friend count etc...<p>you can get value out of facebook, just add the friends who are truly in your inner-circle, or those that were and moved away.<p>you can also prevent yourself from being searched for, so when someone else says i can't find you on facebook, you can say a) oh, i'm not on facebook, or b) oh i have the privacy settings on, i'll send an invite to you",1196192349

83998,comment,83685,83986,0,0,e1ven,,,"Thanks. I agree it's not an ideal situation.. <p>Truth be told, we probably <i>could</i> fix the background download problem.. If we recorded every IP that tried to contact your public IP, and then set your gateway to be through the VPN when trying to reach THAT IP, it just might work.. <p>The thing is, that would be fragile, and might take a week or two of work to get right.. Since this is a legacy application, and we're actively working to replace it, for now I'm happy with the 90% solution. I'd rather spend the two weeks making version 2.0 closer to launch.<p>-Colin",1196191268

83996,comment,83981,83981,0,0,e1ven,,,"I think this is a rather clever idea.. It reminds me a bit of Slashdot's system, with the firehose- Anyone can submit stories, but only editors can promote them to the front page.<p>I can't help but thing there's a way to go one step further though, and automatically make groups based on the people you upvote, or who's pages you like.. This seems like the sort of thing Reddit tries to do with it's customized pages, but if it was pulled off more ideally, you'd get news that's interesting to the people who you've found interesting before.<p>",1196191131

83990,comment,83881,83881,0,0,oditogre,,,"Simple: Make it inconvenient.  Require anybody who marks a post inappropriate to fill in a textbox explaining themselves.  <p>Apply a basic 'stupid filter' to submissions (just to strip out submissions which are gibberish or vulgar) and make it clear to people that you will be filtering on those things.<p>Set a reasonable limit - 250 characters or something, so editors don't have to read essays on why a submission is inappropriate.<p>A little inconvenience goes a long way in shutting down site abusers. ;)  ",1196190943

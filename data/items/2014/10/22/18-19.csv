A consumer wants the lowest possible price. It turns out the goods he bought are stolen property. He didn&#x27;t <i>know</i>, but he is not waived of responsibility. If he was truly unwitting he will not be <i>prosecuted</i>, but the goods will still be repossessed, etc.<p>Basically, it is the consumer&#x27;s drive for the lowest price that creates the market for these illicit goods, so they are not blameless. Additionally, illicit supply chains are hard to attack and often times the consumer &quot;really should have known better&quot;, so one of the ways to attack that supply chain is by slapping the hand of the consumer who patronized it, whether or not they actually <i>meant</i> to buy stolen goods.<p>It&#x27;s hard to deal with the &quot;Well it was cheap and he was shady but I just didn&#x27;t ask too many questions&quot; purchases; responsibility is very diffuse, with everyone doing their best to avoid responsibility.",1414003953

There was no open source or free software movement and everybody seemed perfectly willing to let the business guys handle those difficult questions.<p>Without the GNU Public License, every single business making software would have had to re-invent the wheel from scratch. Imagine if every TV maker and router maker had to re-create busybox. It would have been way worse without GNU.<p>Even though most of the companies that use GNU software rarely contribute back, the world is infinitely better for having it, and it wouldn&#x27;t have ever existed if it weren&#x27;t for Stallman&#x27;s prescience in creating a way for software to remain free legally. That way did not exist before Stallman invented it and would probably still not exist today if he hadn&#x27;t done the monumental work of inventing and evangelizing it. All open source licenses owe their very existence to the GPL.<p>Without Stallman, the idea of free software would have likely taken another fifty years to coalesce, if not longer.

I like that Git is popular and I prefer to learn well-supported tools. But every time I approach learning Git for my own needs, I get stymied and confused.<p>- I don&#x27;t work in teams with other developers. I have no need to share code with anybody.<p>- I am not concerned about data loss, per se, because the systems I build include their own custom automated backup solutions.<p>- I don&#x27;t develop in a VM on my local machine; I develop on a remote dev machine which is an exact system replica of the remote live machine (minus the software under development).<p>So what do I want from Git -- or something like it?<p>I want a good way to manage pushing features from dev to live with granular control. I may be working on 3 features plus a batch of bugfixes on the dev machine. When 1 feature and some of the bugfixes are ready to go I want to be able to push them live without pushing incomplete features live; and of course, I want this all to be as frictionless as possible because I don&#x27;t want to waste time monkeying around with my dev tools when I should be working on dev itself.<p>Gary&#x27;s guide doesn&#x27;t completely get me here, but it is a nice, accessible start. So many Git resources I have read immediately launch into how Git works under the hood. Guess what? I don&#x27;t care!

Currently, all of their newer hardware uses full Battery Back Up (BBU) and RAID on all SSD arrays.  Data centers where you are guaranteed to be on a box with their newer hardware are: NYC3, LON1, and AMS3.  These locations are supported in the Database Labs interface.<p>Digital Ocean&#x27;s other data centers have a mix of hardware.  All hardware at a minimum has dual redundant power supplies and hardware RAID with SSD drives, however, not all hardware has a BBU on the RAID card.  While it is extremely unlikely that there will be a full power outage that overlaps with a write time on a database, it is possible.  We recommend, if this is a concern for anyone, that deployments be restricted to NYC3, LON1, and AMS3.<p>We will be monitoring this issue with Digital Ocean, and will let everyone know as more of their centers are guaranteed to be SSD + RAID + BBU.<p>Thanks for the suggestion of documenting this on the web site, we will be adding some information about this in the near future.",1414003513

Inbox functions very much more like a ToDo list than it does an email client. Here are the workflows I have:<p>Work:<p>I filter all mailing lists into different clusters that I have appear at 7AM every morning. I then scrub through the subject lists to see what happened yesterday, pinning things that require my attention, and then sweeping the rest. At this point, everything pinned in my Inbox is now &quot;something I need to look at&quot;. I then read the email, and decide if it has an action item or not. If it&#x27;s actionable and I intend to do it today, I&#x27;ll leave it pinned. If it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m going to do today, I&#x27;ll Snooze it until I think I&#x27;ll have time to do it, or at least evaluate another Snooze time.<p>To make sure I don&#x27;t miss important emails, I have a cluster that I put all email that has myself explicitly in the To: line, and have that appear whenever anything arrives. I do occasionally miss things that didn&#x27;t have me in the To: and went to my 7AM clusters, but this is few and far between, and I hazard happens less than my Gmail inbox where I had far more cognitive load on managing the emails there.<p>Home:<p>The defaults are tuned well for home, and I use the clusters (like Travel, Purchases etc) like I do for work, having them appear at 7AM each day. Most things get swept immediately, and again I pin things that require my attention and are maybe ToDo items.<p>Inbox is really opinionated about its workflow: if you struggle against it, you&#x27;ll have a bad time, and you&#x27;ll prefer Gmail&#x27;s flexibility. However, if you are Inbox Zero or GTD minded, I think you&#x27;ll love Inbox. Inbox is my ToDo list, and replaces Wunderlist/Things/Evernote/Google Tasks for me. I set reminders to myself for work items that don&#x27;t have an email attached.<p>I encourage everyone to give it a week to see if it suits them, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m all out of invites for now :(",1414002247

A magnetic connector system comprising: a first connector having a first plurality of electrical contacts and a plurality of magnets; and a second connector having a second plurality of electrical contacts and a magnetic element, the second plurality of electrical contacts being adapted to mate with the first plurality of electrical contacts when the first connector couples to the second connector, wherein the plurality of magnets of the first connector are proximally located and are arranged in opposing polarities with respect to each other so that when the first connector is brought in close proximity to the second connector, magnetic field lines travel through the magnetic element of the second connector from one of the plurality of magnets in the first connector to another one of the plurality of magnets in the first connector, thereby increasing magnetic attraction between the first connector and the second connector.</i><p>All the magnets are in the laptop end of the connector pair, not the cable end. Selling only the non-magnet end might not be infringing, since that&#x27;s just a metal plate around some contacts.  You might be able to beat this.  But it would be tough.<p>If you really wanted to pull Apple&#x27;s chain, you could make a better connector than Apple makes.  You could fix the problem with their smaller magnetic connector, which is known to fall off too easily.  Here&#x27;s how.<p>There&#x27;s an exotic device called the Correlated Magnetics MagPrinter (<a href=""http://www.correlatedmagnetics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.correlatedmagnetics.com</a>). This is a CNC machine which magnetizes magnets. Not just ordinary uniform magnets, but single pieces of material with custom-designed magnetic patterns. With this, you can make one piece of magnetic material behave as if it is multiple magnets. You can create magnets with various self-aligning properties. You could probably make a plug for Apple&#x27;s socket which didn&#x27;t look like Apple&#x27;s, didn&#x27;t have a &quot;plurality of magnets&quot;, mated with their connector, and worked better.<p>TechShop in San Francisco has a MagPrinter, and any member can use it.

More than that, if this claim is generally accepted, it will be found in authoritative medical textbooks used to train medical practitioners.

However, in certain settings placebo interventions can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea, though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important. Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&quot;[3]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-placebo-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/michael-specter-on-the-p...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-placebo-effects-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ted-kaptchuk-versus-plac...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fall-of-placebo-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-rise-and-fa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554</a>",1414001974

I don&#x27;t want to use Firebase for anything my own revenue will depend on, and that&#x27;s a shame, because they have made an awesome product.<p>> Forcing an open source on acquisition severely limits your exit options and lowers your acquisition value.<p>These acquisitions of 3 year old companies are always sort of disappointing to me. On the one hand, I&#x27;m truly inspired and encouraged see their measure of success. On the other hand, I&#x27;d <i>really</i> like to see more startups committed to building lasting companies that strive for win-win outcomes that include users, employees, investors <i>and</i> founders. This isn&#x27;t supposed to be a zero sum game.<p>> As much as the users feel like startup founders owe them something, startup founders are human like everyone else. They don&#x27;t exist to be our slaves.<p>With a company like Firebase, there&#x27;s a chain of trust that&#x27;s really important. They are not responsible for just their own individual users. They are responsible for other companies&#x27; users. The effects of everything they do are multiplied accordingly.<p>Part of offering a platform is the guarantee that &quot;this thing you depend on to serve your users will not go away unexpectedly without leaving a viable alternative.&quot; That&#x27;s not an unreasonable thing for someone to demand when they&#x27;re building their house on your foundation.

Chances are you remember nothing and will need to study up. To me, this is completely useless and if your job doesnt entail doing this, I have no idea why they ask these questions.<p>I think what would be a far better option would be to ask you a few algorithm questions, give you a packet to study, then invite you back to test again.

There are bigger differences than this.  But the examples above have both processors set at SMT2 (~30 seconds vs ~10 seconds).  Differences are greater for SMT4 and SMT8.  Of course, if your code fits nicely into the L3 - e.g. if your hot code consumes 3MB, then Power8 will be a bigger winner since there may be more thrashing for the x86 chip - unless, of course, the prediction routines is straight forward and the cacheline can be prefetched (think sequential access vs random access).<p>From what I saw elsewhere, highly parallel code runs faster on P8, where as single thread perf is faster on x86.

Even though I bought the ticket by actually calling United and booking it, because I had some credit from a previous canceled trip.<p>They had a reservation in their system for the correct flight, but no actual ticket, and this was apparently confusing enough to everybody involved that I was able to actually fly from NRT to SMF via SFO without having what amounted to an actual plane ticket.<p>The above four hours doesn't include the two phone calls that it initially required to book the ticket; apparently, they've got a big problem with their outsourced call centers not actually issuing tickets to passengers.  Or the fact that my return flight to Japan had the wrong date.<p>Let's not also forget that every ticket change incurs a fee of $250, no matter what the cause, and that they've pulled all the in-seat entertainment systems, and offer no power ports in Economy.<p>Nothing says 'take your money elsewhere' like a system that's inflexible, impossible to navigate, filled with opportunities for human error, <i>and</i> expensive.",1271739571

Lots of political and government efforts, including the government-sponsored mortgage subsidizers Fannie and Freddie (deeply linked with Dem party leadership), were bending longstanding practice to promote home ownership by all and loans to previously ""underserved"" borrowers.<p>Like Texas, Canada also held fast to the traditional 20% homeowner equity requirement and was similarly spared the same extreme housing bubble and crash.<p>(Now, if some buckaroo lenders want to make risky no-money-down loans, that'd be OK -- as long as public policy wasn't cheering them on, fraud on both sides of the table was vigorously prosecuted, and the public treasury wasn't insuring the transactions.

I mean, the idea of rejecting crappy apps probably came about when people were thinking ""oh, apps will trickle in a few hundred at a time"" instead of flood in.  So they take steps like saying ""must use Apple tools"".  On a Mac, cross-platform Java/QT/Wine apps that totally ignore UI custom are incredibly annoying, so that's probably where Apple is coming from in terms of viewing ""non-Apple tools"" as resulting in poor UI.<p>And it's silly to ask why Apps are censored but movies/music/TV isn't.  The answer's obvious - iTunes includes parental controls for media that allow for blocking content based on industry-standard ratings, and there's no such rating/control system for apps.  If the App Store contains a Daily Tits Calendar App, then parents have to completely block their kids from getting apps from the App Store themselves, whereas parents can let kids buy PG-13 stuff in the iTunes store without worrying about them buying R-rated movies or explicit songs.",1271738769

Whatever typeface that is that is long and tall makes it hard to read.<p>I was surprised (or maybe not so surprised) that none of the designs cut the length in half, like the Virgin America boarding tickets.  When I flew Virgin for the first time, I found it pleasantly nice that I could fit the entire boarding pass in my pocket without it flapping out awkwardly and me worrying that the tab will come off.<p>Design is how it works, no?",1271736847

The Tax Foundation's method might be more meaningful, depending on what you're comparing.<p>But either way it's not all that much of a difference in absolute terms, even if it is in percentage terms. I mean, $1500 on average. Even if you make a lot over the average, it still seems like Texas's biggest win will be the $300,000 difference in the price of a house, or $1000/mo difference in rent, not a few $k savings in taxes.",1271736748

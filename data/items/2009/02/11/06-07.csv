476676,comment,476536,476619,0,0,tsetse-fly,,,"I think approachability is absolutely key. Kids wrote programs on their Commodores, Ataris, and TI calculators because the environment was already setup. You could type in a few commands and <i>instantly</i> have something running (a program that solves the area of a triangle or one that plays a cool sequence of tones). There's only one editor and one language.<p>The majority of today's 10 year olds are not writing twitter scripts. It requires a significant amount of understanding and time to do so. You need to pick a programming language, install it, figure out how to write your program and how to execute it. The barrier is <i>a lot</i> higher than writing a program for your calculator during math class.<p>It'd be much easier for you to find people who wrote trivial programs on their Commodore when they were 10 than it would be to find 10 year olds who are writing python.",1234335336

Of course it does. Despite that, our life expectancy continues to increase.<p>Where's your evidence that it's lack of personal responsibility that is straining the health care system? From my vantage point, the problems we face are structural; we have a uniquely fragile and inefficient health care system, and --- what a coincidence --- a uniquely corporatized system of private health insurance funded by employers.",1234335142

You almost have to listen to a ton of rap and then go back to the roots.<p>The first rap I ever heard was the album De La Soul Is Dead. I happened to hear some of it at a friend's house, and his big brother was kind enough to lend it to me. I just liked what I heard, but of course didn't analyze <i>why</i>.<p>In any case, I don't think there's any harm in even a new rap fan listening to ""the classics"". It helps them get on the right track. Learning to appreciate the classics should come naturally later on.",1234334881

These were a sort of vector graphics which you had to first painstakingly draw on graph paper, unspool as a series of draw/turn commands, and then translate into bitmasks according to a lookup table, and then cut those up at seven-bit intervals, and convert those into decimal numbers. This is not something that anyone ever conceived of as a children's toy. Even though some kids (like myself) persevered.<p>Hm, I wonder if pg's concept of Languages For Smart People applies.

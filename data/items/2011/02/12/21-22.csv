2211224,comment,2210469,2210469,0,0,grellas,,,"IP laws are flawed today in their implementation but it is a serious mistake to say that they are what is blocking innovation in America.<p>It is easy to pick some extremes of flawed implementation of IP laws and to ridicule their effects. Software patents have been seriously abused to block innovation, with the prototypical troll being, in effect, the equivalent of some lawyer sitting in a back room endlessly ""conceiving"" ideas from which extortion-style demands can be exacted. So too with things like the RIAA-led lawsuits demanding millions in damages for the downloading of 20 songs or the Disney-inspired extensions of copyright terms to ridiculous lengths having nothing to do with protection of any conceivable right of an author. Such items can readily and rightly be mocked and cast as the absurd anti-innovative creatures that they are. Nor does it help that the beneficiaries of such legal aberrations are often large and powerful companies, lawyers and lobbyists, and others who might be characterized as the antithesis of innovation in any productive society.<p>That said, IP laws do not in any sense categorically block innovation and, indeed, remain essential to it.<p>To understand the true importance of IP laws, we need to look at fundamentals. Property is both tangible and intangible. You can touch the former and physically transfer it to someone else. It is a thing that is possessed by someone and such possession excludes or limits possession by others because it is a finite resource that can only be shared so much. In the modern age, in contrast, intangible property is capable of almost infinite replication with few, if any, incremental costs. The temptation exists, then, to say that all such property should be commonly shared because it can be so shared and because people will use it to make advancements for the betterment of themselves and society. In other words, there presumably is no cost to making all information free, legally unprotected, and infinitely shareable. Or so the thinking goes.<p>But this assumption is not sound.<p>IP laws are designed to protect all forms of intangible property having commercial value. This means patents (which protect inventions), copyrights (which protect any tangible embodiment of an original work of authorship), trademarks (which protect the distinctiveness of the origin of goods or services), and trade secrets (which protect any form of valuable confidential and proprietary information).<p>These laws are so built into the fabric of the startup world that we normally just take them for granted.<p>For example, no startup could hope to survive without laws protecting trade secrets. Without such laws, whatever information or knowledge base you have in your startup that is unique and valuable could be lifted at will by any passing person: an employee who passes through and copies such information wholesale to give it to a competitor; the janitor who comes in at night who decides to publish it on the internet; someone who breaks into your network, copies it all, and then shares it with the world or, worse, if it is a competitor, who uses it to compete against you. If you once take the legal position that all information is free and freely shareable, then all protections for your confidential business plans, for your technical innovations, for your execution strategy, for your database of key customers, personnel, marketing data, etc. evaporate and you can no longer derive any competitive advantage from any of this as long as anyone gets his hands on it and makes it public.<p>Founder groups would have the same problem in pre-formation situations. Say, four founders build something that they have worked on for a full year and are prepared to launch. One of them defects and says to the group, ""I am going to take everything that we have worked on and take it for myself."" Of course, that is outrageous. Buy why? Because laws exist that declare it illegal for someone to misappropriate what the founders have been working on. Those are IP laws. They protect the interests in intangible property. Without them, every founder would be vulnerable to such defections, without any form of legal recourse.<p>Copyright serves a similar function. Whenever a startup relies on proprietary code, it is copyright (along with trade secret laws) that ensures that the work product of the company can't simply be lifted at will and used in any way that the person taking the code desires.<p>Open source is no exception. It relies heavily on rules of copyright law and on licensing to make its system work. If everything were freely shareable without any form of restriction, one does not have open source - one has freeware.<p>I could go on with this but, having already noted the potential for serious abuse when such laws are ill-formed, I think I have said enough to show that IP laws lie at the foundation of the startup world and are not in themselves the enemy. There are philosophical arguments to be made that all information should be freely shareable but any society based on that premise would be radically different from the one in which startups thrive today.<p>Startups depend heavily on IP laws. Such laws have great value in today's startup culture and ought to be recognized for that contribution. Reform them, absolutely; abolish them, don't even think about it (unless you are ready to embrace a philosophically extreme position about all forms of intangible property ownership). I don't believe most people are prepared to embrace the extreme position and, hence, one ought to be careful about castigating that which is good while condemning that which we can agree is bad.<p>Bottom line: IP laws do not kill innovation and, on the contrary, are vital to it. <i>Flawed</i> IP laws stink and need to be reformed.",1297547573

2211212,comment,2210147,2211164,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Complexity is not equal because the hidden variables of g (I will use it as you do for now) is not equal to the hidden variables of pressure.<p>The term statistical myth is appropriate because g is a myth. It is not backed by any direct experimental evidence but arises due to manipulations of statistical techniques. The Gas Law you cite was derived from experiments not from muddled manufacturings of statistics. And the tests correleate because they are made to correlate - it is all quite circular. Your post misrepresents Shalizi. Shalizi's argument is <i>not</i> ""macroscale variables which abstract away an ensemble of microscale variables are a 'statistical myth'"". Rather, it is that the way in which the latent variable g is first arrived at and then subsequently used to drive conclusions is <i>invalid and meaningless</i>:<p><i>But now new tests are validated by showing that they are highly correlated with the common factor, and the validity of g is confirmed by pointing to how well intelligence tests correlate with one another and how much of the inter-test correlations g accounts for. (That is, to the extent construct validity is worried about at all, which, as Borsboom explains, is not as much as it should be. There are better ideas about validity, but they drive us back to problems of causal inference.) By this point, I'd guess it's impossible for something to become accepted as an ""intelligence test"" if it doesn't correlate well with the Weschler and its kin, no matter how much intelligence, in the ordinary sense, it requires, but, as we saw with the first simulated factor analysis example, that makes it inevitable that the leading factor fits well. [13] This is circular and self-confirming, and the real surprise is that it doesn't work better.</i><p>As I quoted Shalizi prior: <i>'I don't want to be mis-understood as being on some positivist-behaviorist crusade against inferences to latent mental variables or structures. As I said, my deepest research interest is, exactly, how to reconstruct hidden causal structures from data.'</i><p>I also do not understand how you use g, as explained it is not composed of factors. <i>It is the dominating factor</i>. While I do not know about Intelligence tests I did follow the mathematics he gives and have applied similar in machine learning contexts. And Considering the wide variety of data linear models fail to properly capture my intuition is that yes, linear methods and assumptions of a Gaussian is overly simplistic without a solid backing argument, which has been unable to be given for near on a century now.<p>p.s. you are right, my original post was orthogonal to what Shalizi had to say. This was just my argument agains't yours in that I don't feel generalizing to one factor for a system as complex as human intelligence will produce as meaningful results as generalizing to a simple law for a collection of atoms/ a gas did.",1297547226

So if I want to build something and need to buy land from one person, that's fine; if I need to buy land from 10 people each will want more than 1/10 what the single guy would want; if I need to buy land from 100 people each will want more than 1/10 what each of the 10 guys will want; and this very quickly makes it impossible to get anything done if people know what your doing since they'll all want more than 1/N of the generated value.<p>Applying this to patents, it's very hard to get anything done if multiple entities own patents that they can use to block it. So firstly this discourages innovation right off (since there's no point), but also it leads to the people who do have patents forming a patent pool. Which lets them build things covered by the patents, but means there's even less point for outsiders to try to innovate, which also means the insiders are secure enough in their oligopoly that they don't need to innovate either.<p>So there should be a cycle, innovation (for maybe a year or two?) => patent thicket => patent pool => wait for patents to expire (or something entirely different to come along) => ...",1297547094

He had a terrible, terrible time with math in public school and really hated and dreaded the subject by the time we pulled the kids out to homeschool.  It was clear to me he would not be able to memorize his way through math like his mom had.  (I was in my thirties when I discovered some of this stuff had actual uses. sigh)  My top priority for math with this child was to teach him ""math is your friend"".  He's a science geek (which is tough when math is not something you are good at) and loves physics.  He taught me most of the physics I know (speaking in little words and repeating himself a lot) when he was 14, which stood me in very good stead when taking certain college classes later on.<p>A few things we did:<p>Chapter books, full of discussion about math and light on formulas.<p>Let him choose a statistics track over an algebra/geometry/trig track.  (We did some algebra and geometry but not too much.)<p>Read about halfway through ""A tour of the calculus"".  I dropped out of calculus my first quarter in college and never wanted to see the subject again, after having been inducted into Mu Alpha Theta in 11th grade.  He would spend an hour on this with me because it was the only math that made more sense to him than to me and he was happy to watch me get a headache (which I played for all it was worth). This book was chosen because he loves physics and calculus is the math of physics and because calculus really requires you to learn all that algebra/geometry/trig stuff he wanted nothing to do with.  I knew I had won the battle when he was whining and complaining one day about not wanting to do math and then got all perked up at the idea of working on reading a couple more pages of this book with me.<p>We also did ""fun"" stuff, like card games and such in place of workbooks and that did have some value.  But reading part of ""A tour of the calculus"" was the single biggest thing I did to get him past this mental and emotional block. Which I guess largely agrees with this article, though perhaps framed a little differently.",1297546106

Your appeal to complexity was both incorrect (pressure = sum of hidden variables, g = sum of hidden variables, complexity is equal) and also irrelevant (Shalizi's argument is against statistical reductions and is independent of complexity).<p>My objection is not to the fact that Shalizi is hypothesizing a microstructure to g. Here is what I had to say about that part of the article: <i>""It's a great article... Thompson's model makes a specific prediction about g - it should be normally distributed. So overall, I agree with the author's scientific argument: g is very likely to be decomposable into subfactors.""</i><p>My objection is simply to the term ""statistical myth"". By Shalizi's argument, macroscale variables which abstract away an ensemble of microscale variables are a ""statistical myth"". Depending on your philosophical axioms, that's a fine thing to believe - but we should acknowledge that if you believe this, then you also believe pressure is also a statistical myth.<p>As for the new points you raise:<p>1) G is a tautology if you deliberately posit a family of normally distributed variables with positive correlations. In fact, it's a tautology if you posit a family of strongly correlated normally distributed variables of any sort (the factors might just have negative components).<p>This does not, however, explain why performance on various tests is correlated. G and multifactor models are an attempt at explaining this. Thompson's model (which has g built in) is another.<p>2) Indeed, we don't really understand it. For a long time we didn't understand pressure or temperature either - all we understood was the macroscopic effects. So what?<p>3) You are clearly speaking about something you don't know much about.

2211119,comment,2210026,2210026,0,0,Tycho,,,"Hmm. Finding maths so dull was probably one of the main reasons that I didn't peruse a degree and CS or physics. Which was a disastrous decision for me personally. Not that I just couldn't face studying anything unexciting per se, but that I (wrongly) assumed that if I didn't find something interesting then i could never be sufficiently good at it. At high school I was 'streamed' into one of the lower tier math classes, which I resented - result was getting a higher mark in the end than most of the top-tier students. But perhaps I would have been better off in a more advanced class where I'd struggle more but at least find the stuff interesting.<p>Anyway my point is it's a shame to turn people <i>away</i> from maths by offering such stale curriculum.",1297544587

Specifically the phrase ""now that the company had split up"" is false.  The company had not yet split up. He had (at most) a verbal agreement with his cofounders that they would split up the company in the future, but they had not acted on it yet.  Our advice was not to.",1297544421

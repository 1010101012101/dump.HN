And it seems he doesn't get the point.<p>He claims everyone is on the 35 years federal prison maximum sentence train and that he sees no mention of the 6 months plea offer. Besides the fact that if you are not guilty (I'm not american) I would simply not plea guilty I think that the persecutor scare tactics is enough to be asking for her resignation as it is the very definition of bullying which too often heads people into suicide, by leaving them a worst alternative (i.e. costing family and friends lots of money). Offer or no offer.<p>Bullying: Use superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to force him or her to do what one wants.<p>Basically going to federal prison 6 months, ruining you financially and having a criminal record for breaking some TOS/EULA for freeing _state_funded_ research which should have been free in first place is the fabulous offer ? How about thank you but no thank you ?<p>If he is guilty, i.e. trespassing, I would say the sentence should maybe be something like a month worth of social works.

Aggravating this, the extreme negative consequences of taking them at their word (as Aaron did) is why I've selected to say that their actions probe the depths of intellectual dishonesty.<p>Full-text search, like printing, is a value-added service.  There is no reason to keep public domain works hostage by the threat of sending people like Aaron to jail for decades just so that they can offer FTS.  If JSTOR wants to offer FTS or other services on the corpus of public domain works, let them charge for access to those services.<p>An existence proof: arXiv offers bulk download access to the works in their repository (~490GiB) via Amazon S3 Requester-Pays buckets [1]. The requester is paying Amazon, not arXiv; so, arXiv doesn't earn ""pennies per article"", it earns nothing.  Incidentally, arXiv also provides full-text search [3].<p>Let's talk about capacity planning. Let's guess that average size of a digitized journal article is 5 MiB, that comes out to ~361 TB, or $44,400 to stream from S3.  The at-rest cost of those articles is far lower because there are far fewer articles than downloads (I don't have a number, but would you argue otherwise?).<p>My proposal: JSTOR removes its watermarks and puts all public domain works and associated metadata into S3 Requestor-Pays buckets.  They finance their operations by selling non-public-domain works and value-added services like FTS at a price the market will bear.<p>Earnings made by restricting bulk access to public domain works is blood money.  Watermarking these documents is confusing - no one seems to have answered my questions about whether they are claiming a new copyright.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3</a>

5060685,comment,5060103,5060479,12,0,jules,,,"OkCupid probably has a very good idea of how attractive a person is based on how many profile views and messages they get. I'd be very surprised if they aren't using that data to match roughly equally attractive people. Perhaps they are even taking personal preferences into account with probabilistic matrix factorization that is often used for recommendation systems. Basically if person X shows interest in A, and person Y shows interest in A and in B, then this makes it more likely that person X will like B as well. Whether A and B are movies, products on Amazon or people on OkCupid, PMF can exploit this kind of data to match people to products or to other people.<p>The biggest problem with algorithmic blind dating is probably not actual average quality of dates, but rather (perceived) risk of going on a bad date. People trust their friends a lot more than an algorithm.",1358264973

Also these guys had big budgets, unlike all the other advertisers, so when there were days when a certain offer would earn more then 100k they would be happy to pay. I'm guessing the other networks didn't have enough liquid assets to pay back publishers on time (we would get paid every Tuesday usually). Also the main network wasn't fussy where the traffic came from, as where every other network wants organic traffic (which is basically impossible anyway), so they would usually cut you off as soon as you started sending social media traffic, email traffic, sms traffic etc.<p>But I primarily did email submit offers, they would convert as soon as someone put in their email so we would usually get conversion rates of 30-60% which was pretty dang good.<p>But yea acai/ringtone got wiped out when the FTC stepped in over all the 'legitimate' reviews and credit card companies got strict on rebilling (which was the only reason they made money).<p>The whole industry is struggling though, most people are now trying to make money from selling SEO services or reselling Facebook Fans and Youtube Views (which Google nuked the other day).",1358264478

I had a long think about this and gave up but came back to it.

By making voting compulsory, you get input from people who are apathetic, but likely to be scathing towards people who are obsessed with a particular ideology.<p>I thought about negative votes as well, but went hard against it - it leads to intrigue and strategic voting, which rewards ingenuine behaviour and gaming.<p>Another mad option I've thought about: have an upper house, and make parties nominate five people for every upper house position. If the position is won, then the person to fill it must be randomly selected from the pool of nominations (by a computer or similar). I still have some attraction to this.",1358263759

Forums offer value not just in their activity level but in their archives. It's easy to find any post mentioning the word ""aerator"" for example. You cannot do that easily on Facebook. Besides, Facebook is also used in a more social way than many forums. People post ""funny pictures of their cat on their restaurant manual"" on Facebook, for example, but they'll ask ""Where should I get my restaurant manuals printed?"" on a forum.<p>2) The obvious next question is, ""So they'll also search on Facebook for niche groups. How will your list trump FB's up to date results?""<p><i>It is not just about discovering startup ideas. </i><p>I think you missed my point completely with this, or so it reads. I'm saying that, for your list to be useful, people have to remember that it exists. No one has to remember that Google or Facebook exists. If they have a problem, bam - off to Google to see if other people have written about it. But where, in the order of when someone thinks ""How I will go about finding niche sites"" will <i>your</i> list appear?<p><i>if people find it valuable it is worth the effort</i><p>But if they <i>don't</i> find it valuable, was it worth the effort?

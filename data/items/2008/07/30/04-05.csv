261531,comment,261394,261394,0,0,pragmatic,,,"It's easy to think all companies rely on apache on Linix as you do.  However, in the ""real world"" a bazillion companies depend on Windows to run stuff.  And a lot of those companies depend on the software that was built for windows 3.1, NT, 2000 and XP.  Not the latest and greatest.  As such, MSFT has to maintain backward compatibility.  If they start screwing with corporate customers and backwards compatibility they're going to have the department of justice so far up their asses...well you get the picture.<p>Windows runs the world.  I'm sorry I know the internet is hosted on a lot of Linix servers but in small, medium and large businesses there a LOT of windows servers keeping everything running.",1217393829

261529,comment,261394,261394,0,0,mlinsey,,,"The article seems to indicate that this is something being done by Microsoft Research (MSR).  In that case, there's no telling when it will be done, or if it is, whether it will even be used for a commercial version of Windows. MSR works more or less independently from the business divisions of the company.<p>Of course, if things turn out really well and there is a strong business case then there is every reason to think it would be adopted.  But what clearly won't happen is what people are prediction (hoping?) elsewhere in this thread, that work will be poured into this and the ambitiousness of this project will cause Windows to be delayed.  If this never sees the light of day than the actual Windows team will just keep on chugging along at whatever their plan A is.",1217393488

I get a complete match with the resultant face by doing this in Photoshop.<p>If this is right, then the program is agnostic to individual facial features, as in it's everything from the eyebrows to the lips, or nothing.<p>Also, if this is right, would there be privacy implications to the person whom the face is extracted from? If you are protecting the privacy of the person whose face is swapped out, then it makes sense that only their frame remains, but the hybrid face is very similar to the original face (second photo).",1217393165

It's the most accurate way to measure distance.<p>If you wonder how it works: the unit has a spinning mirror. It sends out pulses of laser light as the mirror spins and measures how quickly the light takes to return after it hits an object to return to a sensor on the unit. If you know how fast light moves and have a fast processor, you can measure distance.)<p>Because they are being used sideways, they sweep from sky to ground measuring distance. They are probably being used to ""map"" buildings as they drive by, so that the data could be  used to create better 3D maps.<p>(They aren't perfect: reliability includes a variety of factors including environment [how do bushes and trees affect laser measurement] and distance [range may only be 50ft for instance])",1217392552

261512,comment,261394,261442,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, I think until fairly recently the backwards compatible group had it right. Windows had way too much going on in the corporate world to even consider it. But now in the era of (relatively) good virtualization and lots of cool web apps running on a nearly ubiquitous internet, the other group's argument has gotten a lot stronger. That's sort of the catch-22 for Microsoft though, because the exact same arguments make OSX an option for more users.<p>I think MS is a little behind on this, but only a little. Still I hope they don't ditch the Windows brand name, it's clearly one of the most successful of all time. Isn't midori a watermelon liqueur?",1217392050

261509,comment,260421,261281,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>You ask about how many open source projects I manage. None. I am a completely private sector guy.</i><p>So you pretty much don't get Open Source.  And that's OK.  There's plenty of room for both commercial and Open Source development.  But, it nullifies your claims on the topic, since you've established you do not share, or comprehend, the mindset of Open Source developers.<p><i>We fixed it because we had a time motive, resources, and focus. Right there: done. No hesitating, we needed to move onto something else. That kind of focus would certainly help OSS.</i><p>What makes you think OSS needs help?  I think Apache just called to remind you not to teach your granny how to suck eggs.<p>You're making the very common mistake of assuming Open Source software is for <i>you</i>.  Open Source software is for the developer of the software.  If anybody else likes it, that's wonderful.  But it's not (generally) the reason it exists.  It exists because someone wanted to build something.  Sometimes they also want to build a business around the software they build, in which case they have to answer all of the needs of commercial software, in addition to keeping an Open Source community happy (which makes it a doubly hard challenge, but it brings some advantages, as well).<p><i>Anyway... That may very well explain why private projects move faster than open source ones, the private ones have a profit motive, failure means financial failure.</i><p>And it may explain why OSS projects, in general, have dramatically higher quality code.  Motivations are different.  ""Needs"" are determined by hackers...not marketing guys, MBAs, or even (perhaps to the detriment of user friendliness) customers.<p>Though I question your unfounded assertion that proprietary projects move faster, and I think you need to be specific.  Does Microsoft innovate faster than the Linux developers?  How about Apple?  Would Apple be where they are today without FreeBSD and Mach?<p>I would concur that proprietary software companies sometimes move faster on usability.  Certainly Microsoft has better accessibility than Gnome and Linux.  But Linux has better large systems support than Microsoft or Apple (but not as good as Sun...though Solaris is now Open Source, I think we can give this point to the proprietary side, since most of the features were developed by a single company and before Solaris was fully Open Source).  Likewise small systems support, where Linux has a very solid lead over Microsoft and Apple (and Sun).  Hardware support is also better in Linux than both Windows Vista and Apple OS X (and Solaris).  So who is moving faster?<p>And, to come back to Apache...name any proprietary product that does <i>half</i> of what Apache can do or gets support for new protocols sooner.<p>Open Source developers and commercial developers have different priorities.  Your priority seems to be condescension.  ;-)<p><i>No matter how altruistic you are, if you fail financially, you don't eat.</i><p>Altruism isn't the point of most Open Source software.",1217391984

261507,comment,261500,261500,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I wrote this last weekend because I was getting so overwhelmed with job lead emails and interview programming tasks that I was sure I was dropping promising leads on the floor, but couldn't remember which ones.  Worse yet, since I couldn't decide what to work on, I ended up working on nothing and watching YouTube videos instead.<p>It should be pretty self-explanatory (I hope), but the basic idea is to remove as many decisions as possible from your to-do list, so that the computer just tells you what to do, you do it, and then you go back for more.  It's also tracking what & when you complete, and I hope to add some views in the near future that show you everything you've done over time as an additional motivational boost.<p>I'm not sure whether it's a startup, a side-project, or just a personal tool yet, but I'll be listening to any and all feedback and probably implementing a lot of it.  Still not sure whether I want to jump back into the startup world or go get a job, though I suspect that the job offers won't last long if I keep delaying their interview problems to work on side projects.  I figured I had this idea, I needed it myself, it'd only take a weekend to implement, and then I kept coming up with cool new ideas for features.<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated.  If it's something people find useful, I'll probably ELance out the design (my aesthetic sense is terrible) and maybe find a new name, since WhatShallIDoNow doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.    I'd particularly like to know whether the concept itself is something folks would use.",1217391915

Since it is clearly possible to build even very expensive infrastructure by private means, we have to ask if it fair or efficient to do otherwise. Is it okay to tax people in California to pay for highway boondoggles in Massachusetts? Is it in society's best interest for infrastructure to be built by entities that have a history of being behind schedule and over budget? Is it wise to build more highways than the free market would provide in order to have cheap transit when all side effects are considered? I'm not sure.",1217391593

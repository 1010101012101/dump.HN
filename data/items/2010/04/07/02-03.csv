Understand what those are and where they come from. \n3) Talk to people, read, and if that's not enough, get help (seems like you're doing that).

In the moments when I feel most stuck and unmotivated it is usually because there is something looming over me that I ""have to do.""<p>It's taken time, but developing the mindset that I truly do not _have to_ do anything has allowed me actually drop the anxiety and become truly excited about my work.<p>What are your expectations about what you _should be_ doing? Maybe if you ease up on them, you'll find a new wave of motivation along a new path.<p>2. It sounds to me like you, more than anything, need some exploration in your life. But, you are afraid of the risks.<p>My suggestion here is to take time to define clearly what you are afraid of, what the worst case scenarios are and how to sidestep them.<p>Additionally, lighten physical and mental load. Can you and your girlfriend sell the bulk of your stuff, tie down any loose ends and explore the World without making any living commitments for a few months?<p>3. Set small challenges daily (2-3), write them down every morning along with the very specific next action that you need to do to get the ball rolling.<p>When you complete all your challenges, put a big red x on the calendar. With each challenge, you will feel better and better and as the red X's grow, it will be clear how much you've accomplished.<p>(Someone else suggested exercise, that is a great daily challenge.)<p>4. I write ~1600 words daily in MacJournal, just a total brain dump. I don't worry about spelling, grammar or paragraphs I just type. I very rarely go back and read old ones.<p>Somehow, just the act of typing through my thoughts, getting them out and throwing them around has had an incredible impact on my mood, motivation, etc. I feel like my own therapist.<p>5. I think Steve Pavlina's book, Personal Development for Smart People, is one of the most complete and impactful books on improving your lifestyle. In particular, there are some great thoughts on finding your purpose on life. Highly recommended.<p>Again, props to you for grappling with these emotions and talking about them publicly. Keep exploring them with others.<p>Feel free to get in touch with me to discuss more, I'd love to hear how things pan out!",1270608334

1246306,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I went through this a couple of years ago. I got out of grad school, and started my postdoc. For the previous 8 years (undergrad + grad school), I had a well defined track: grad school -> PhD -> postdoc -> research professor -> tenure. During my postdoc, I realized I didn't like a great deal of the day to day work of academia: teaching, writing papers, applying for grants, hyping your work. The job I succeeded in getting was not the job I thought it was. I went through the exact stage of uncertainty you are describing.<p>Then I decided to forget about a long term plan and focus on day to day living. I took up Eskrima (Filipino martial arts), something I wanted to do for a long time. I broke up with my long term girlfriend and decided to leave the academic track. I still don't know where I want to live or what I want to be doing (in the long term), but I don't need to know that.<p>Yesterday I went for a run (my first this year). I found a new job (trader at a hedge fund) which I enjoy day to day. Most tuesday nights I fight with sticks. I drink more beer, am in better physical shape and am simply happier. I don't have the answers to your big questions (where to live, what to do), but I don't need answers.<p>So, my suggestion: don't worry about the future, focus on things right now.",1270608305

Exercise, happy entertainment, and happy friends all help.<p>I refuse to accept that adulthood is about acknowledging limits and settling into a static and subtlety unsatisfying existence. I believe I only have one life to live, and I refuse to waste it. I want to add value to the world, and I am frothing at the mouth to do so. That's what I believe being an adult is -- accepting responsibility for my own life, acknowledging the values of other's lives, and then doing my best to add as much value to the world as possible.<p>As for your fear of making real decisions about where to live, your uncertainty about what will make you happy...

Today we'd laugh at that. Really, this example is so glaring that I'm surprised you'd offer this argument. And in fact you acknowledge that the local loop is separate from the actual network. But the difference in the US is that this <i>is</i> a free market -- I can choose to use Embarq (the traditional copper-wire circuit-switched carrier), or I can (and do) use Vonage, or scads of other IP-based carriers, or I could do like many people do and just use cellular.

It works just like the phones: where the infrastructure demands a single source, that's what we get, but that doesn't mean that the people that provide the wires can be the only one involved in the business.

3665006,comment,3664459,3664927,18,0,patio11,,,"Sure.  First and most important thing for understanding Real World costs: one engineer is $20k per month in fully loaded costs (salary, benefits, taxes, overhead).  One engineer-day costs you $1k.  These go up for emergency response because a) on-call b) experts are even more expensive than generic engineers.<p>Github's first response to this would be pushing a Big Red Button that would get 4+ engineers to devote their Sunday to this.  That's $4,000, cash money.  The predictable second step after the bleeding stops is to do a line-by-line audit of their entire code base.  My guesstimate for Github is that that would cost north of 50 man days ($50k).<p>But wait, there's more!  As a result of this compromise, Github is likely going to hire external security firms to pentest them and make process recommendations.  The caliber of firm they would consider employing will cost, bare minimum, five figures.  Cost goes up pretty rapidly.<p>But wait there's more!  Github will, as a result of this incident, have a number of people close accounts today (totally measurable) and an unknown number avoid creating accounts in the future.  LTV for SaaS customers very quickly becomes motivational numbers.  A single company moving its repo from Github to an internal system because Github Let Anyone See Any Repo (+) could easily cost $5k+ in LTV, and that scales horizontally across their entire client base.  Scaring your customers' PHBs is never fun.  This issue will be held against Github in a thousand internal conversations.<p>But wait there's more!  Highly visible security problems will bring Fortune 500 lawyers out to play.  ""You just caused a security audit for us.  It cost $250,000.  Where should we send the invoice?

I work in network/information security, and if we had a security incident on a Sunday, it would go to our backup team (of one). If they (he) deemed it critical, they would notify the security director, who would notify my boss, who would notify the rest of the team.

If the concern is that Instapaper is bad because it bypasses the content providers income methodology then Readability is also bad because it does the exact same thing. The only difference is that Readability has created their own income methodology, of which a portion they feed back to the content providers (sometimes). At no point does either service require a content provider opt-in before the service's users are able to pull content from the providers.<p>I believe Instapaper has an opt-out function for content providers whereby Instapaper users are prevented from adding that content providers content to their Instapaper account. Does Readability have that opt-out capability as well? If not, Readability could very well be considered worse than Instapaper on a moral scale since Readability then becomes a form of blackmail: agree to accept payment for your content that we decide is just, otherwise we'll simply eliminate your existing payment method anyway.<p>I fail to see how any moral analysis of either service could conclude one is good and the other bad.

Of course, learning ways of modeling expands your repertoire. I would hesitate to say that ""programming languages"" are the richest source of such models. Even within them, features like dynamic typing and closures are less significant than logic/constraint programming - or GPGPU languages.<p>On a separate issue, we can also see programming languages as an instance of exponentially improving technology (Kurzweil). I haven't seen a chart of the productivity improvements of ""programming languages"" over time, but certainly there's no contention over the dramatic improvements from raw machine code, to assemblers, to compilers etc.<p>The mechanism is the same as for increasing returns for technologies: standing on the shoulders of giants, and seeing further, especially ways of doing things (the meaning of ""technology""). That is, we create the next generation of programming languages using the previous generation (and benefiting from their productivity). e.g. we wrote compilers with assemblers, then with compilers, and then with specialized tools (yacc, lex etc).<p>At the forefront of technology, it's not always obvious which ways will turn out to be best til afterwards - it's an exploration of the news, which is unknown by definition. Anyone who thinks they know the answers before they start exploring misunderstands the nature of exploration. Before we have definite facts, we have opinions and contention - which is all for the good, if it causes people to look harder rather than argue blindly.",1330909877

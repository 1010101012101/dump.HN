8697087,comment,8696391,8696391,0,0,interesting_att,,,"Most people in this thread are focusing on developer effectivenss as the sole criteria for office layout. But developer effectiveness != startup&#x27;s health.<p>There are three things many people in the discussion are forgetting:<p>1) Open office vs closed office is not a strict binary- I have noticed that employees in open office layouts are also the most lenient on WFH. I do not see as much leniency/openness towards WFH in closed workplaces. So we have to compare Open Office with lots of WFH vs Closed Office with less WFH.<p>2) Open offices lead to higher employee retention- Open offices might lead to more interruptions, which might decrease developer effectiveness. However, I have also noticed that open offices lead to a greater social cohesion (since people are more likely to talk and form social bonds), which in turn leads to higher employee retention. It is hard to leave a company where all your friends are. Which would you prefer as a CEO: A company where developers are 20% more effective but 50% more likely to leave, or developers who are more likely to leave? In my experience, CEOs would prefer the latter, as it&#x27;s difficult to onboard new engineers.<p>3) Open offices engender more diverse ideas- Companies are also filled with product managers, designers, sales teams, marketing heads, customer and community support, finance, QA, and other teams. An open office will more likely lead to different teams talking to each other, which in turn creates a whole new batch of ideas. Startups rely on new ideas. New ideas often come from diverse group of people interacting.",1417650565

8697081,comment,8696255,8696587,0,0,taliesinb,,,"> The high level functions, while nice for demos, never quite do what you need. Want to display data vs. time with errorbars around the data? Sorry, no function for this completely exotic use case, please hack a DateListPlot on top of an ErrorListPlot [1].<p>&#x27;Never&#x27; seems like quite a generalization. What about e.g. Classify and Predict, or FormFunction, or Interpreter, or Nearest? Do those <i>all</i> not do quite what you need? Conversely, does other software do better, on average, in &#x27;doing what one wants&#x27;? Which software?<p>There are gaps, definitely, one small example you&#x27;ve pointed out. My pet peeve, for example, is that it is unnecessarily difficult to map colors and sizes onto graph vertices based on vertex properties, which I needed to do for [1].<p>Still, the scope of visualization functionality is so vast [4] that it&#x27;s not surprising there are gaps (which we continue to plug, the whole language is a never ending project). And having users report to us what they want lets us prioritize those things. Anyway, clearly DateListPlot should learn about error bars, and I&#x27;m sure in a year or two it will. Although it is frustrating you can&#x27;t just go in there and tweak the source code yourself, I agree.<p>> Don&#x27;t get me started on the KelvinsDifference vs. Kelvins thing, which are both represented by the same symbol to maximize your confusion when your unit conversions are failing...<p>I think Quantities should probably gain a little box, like DateObjects have [2], that lets you mouse-over for more information, which should make this problem easier to diagnose. But the distinction is apparently important [3], although I don&#x27;t want to &quot;get you started&quot; :-).

I think the point you&#x27;re trying to make about an &#x27;interruption deficit&#x27; is off the mark. Someone new to a team is going to ask many more questions than a veteran and it&#x27;s certainly damaging to their ability to learn if asking questions is a chore or unwelcome socially. Email and messaging apps are alternatives of course, and are often the right choice when the question doesn&#x27;t merit interruption. But sometimes a quick answer is needed to progress at all and being able to turn around and say something makes things faster.<p>In open office spaces people are still able to work from a laptop somewhere else, put on headphones, or work from home. And having your own office doesn&#x27;t mean you aren&#x27;t interrupted. People would tend to come by for long periods of time when I had an office, seemingly because they were starved of social interaction.<p>A caveat to all this is that for a brief period I was in an overly crowded open office arrangement and that was very much detrimental to my work.",1417649432

Most offices have standard fluorescent lights, often with cheap bulbs or ballasts that have not been changed since the building was built.<p>People also have different temperatures that they are comfortable at.<p>So, you really need at minimum four offices:

Not in their core educational functions.<p>We as hackers can tell that our $1,500 Macbook Pros are better than $450 Inspirons, so Apple thrives.<p>The problem is that it is much more difficult to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality education. With vocational training it is easy: do employers like the graduates? Do they get hired at a substantially higher rate than non-graduates? Do they get paid more? But with education it is much, much harder.<p>There are some objectively observable traits that can (sort of) tell you whether an environment is likely to contribute to certain kinds of personal intellectual growth: do students read and respond to (at least) the Western literary canon? Are classes small enough to facilitate meaningful discussion? Are a wide variety of courses taught? How deep into their respective fields to the syllabi go? Does the school actually own the equipment and materials necessary to perform the kinds of laboratory procedures that a graduate in the sciences should have experienced? Are the classes hard enough that not everyone gets perfect scores all the time? How many hours do students need to spend on the coursework to make good grades?<p>But all of these can be gamed. Hire lots of cheap, incompetent professors. Have small group discussions where you basically just sit there for an hour talking about nothing and wasting time because the professor is doing something else on his laptop. Force students to write papers, but have an institutional culture where they are mostly bullshitted or plagarized and no one cares. Don&#x27;t actually take the time to grade students&#x27; work, but assign bad grades to the handful of students least likely to make a fuss. Assign lots of busywork. Etc. Attract students with good high school test scores by lobbying to divert government funding that would have allowed them to attend better institutions, and set your own prices cheaper.<p>Think of any other property of legitimately good education, someone can probably find a way to appear to have that property more efficiently than actually having it.<p>The only reason this isn&#x27;t widespread is because administrators are generally people who want to provide good education and have the freedom to spend pretty much whatever they can get their hands on to do so.<p>If you replace them with administrators who want to serve shareholders instead of students, they will find ways to hit the metrics that actually influence reveneue (i.e. rankings) while spending less than the other guys, and that will probably mean compromising the quality of the education they provide.",1417648084

8696951,comment,8682996,8696787,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"The scenarios I worked on were for load balancers, proxies, and analyzers. All very high performance (at peak, 5TB/day of SIP on a single quad core processor). SIP parsing is terrible for this and leads to ugly hacky code. Same as HTTP (look at nginx&#x27;s parsing code - all sorts of crazy compares). This is also why the HTTP replacement protocols ditched this nonsense.<p>Yes, a lot of stuff came from HTTP, which likewise has no excuse other than copying previous mistakes (the date example being a prime example). Except, SIP isn&#x27;t HTTP compatible, and no implementation is going to be sharing code. It&#x27;d beyond bizarre wishful thinking that an implementation is going to share any nontrivial amount of code. One of the folks from the RFC explained they aimed to make it HTTP compatible to use HTTP proxies, than gave up part way through but didn&#x27;t fix up the rest of it.<p>At any rate, you can blame SIP for it - no need to copy previous mistakes. And HTTP deserves a ton of blame, and I&#x27;d be absolutely surprised to find out that most software follows the HTTP spec. Most likely, they follow something sort of looking like HTTP, and test on the Internet to see which subset is actually being followed. Just like no one puts comments into email URIs because it&#x27;s stupid.<p>Fragmentation does _not_ need to be taken care of in protocol. IP already does fragmentation and it works. As I noted: 1-2% of all our customers had MTUs of ~576 bytes, so their SIP UDP packets were already IP fragemented. No one experienced problems with this, and some broken IP fragmentation issue would also affect TCP. UDP has a limit, but they could specify a switch to TCP at 64K. Could you clarify what you mean?<p>UDP actually makes DoS harder to deal with as there&#x27;s no handshake for determining the other IP actually exists. Whereas with TCP syn cookies, that particular problem is totally solved. Also, any benefits of UDP in this case are totally negated because <i>implementations &quot;MUST&quot; support both</i>. Any client or server that only uses UDP is broken. So embedded devices and the other scenarios you mention have to handle both protocols, on a message-by-message basis. There&#x27;s no case where this is beneficial. Oh, also, since most VoIP systems today rely on IP authentication, UDP combined with the SIP routing rules means almost all of them are trivially exploitable. Despite this being a rather obvious attack, I&#x27;ve yet to see any SIP stacks explicitly harden for this. Larger companies hope firewalling is good enough (hint: it&#x27;s not really). Look up Cloudflare&#x27;s handling of DNS-based DDoS&#x27;s for another example of why it&#x27;s a bad decision.<p>AFAIK HTTP doesn&#x27;t allow &quot;triangle&quot; paths, like SIP. That is, in SIP, A talks to proxy B, which talks to client C. Then client C <i>sends directly back to A</i>. Of course, in reality, everyone turns on record route to make it act sane, but it&#x27;s one more thing that&#x27;s in the protocol and is lying in wait to screw someone over or just make things more complicated than necessary. But in SIP, this is not only possible, it&#x27;s celebrated and drawn into diagrams, showing off how fantastic an idea they think it is.<p>These kind of things arise when people act clever when writing stuff out on paper. When you&#x27;re just writing a spec, your imagination is the limit. Actual implementation considerations are a detail that doesn&#x27;t bother you. Actually, SIP requires an AI to be properly implemented, as the RFCs suggest implementation &quot;infer&quot; the &quot;intent&quot; of messages, which sounds like a job for GAI. Likewise, comments in headers, headers in querystring, multi-protocol flip-flopping, inane rewrite-TCP-inside-UDP, etc. etc. are all just a few keystrokes away when you&#x27;re making up a spec.<p>After all, SIP even says maybe someone would use it to start a chess game, that&#x27;s their actual example. Despite having &quot;Call-ID&quot; as a mandatory header, they want to make it clear they&#x27;re not about just calls! Oh no, they&#x27;ve implemented a general purpose session protocol.<p>Look up the RFC for SIP torture tests. They revel in the fact they&#x27;ve created a terrible grammar with special syntax for various headers (multiple headers are separate, unless they&#x27;re Accept, in which case combine them into a single value). There&#x27;s no need for that and it just shows what a terrible idea it is to have text protocols without strict grammars.<p>For a humorous take on this: <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-four-oh-00.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-four-oh-00.txt</a> In which he mocks the SIP design decisions, but in a very accurate way reflecting what real-world networks actually do.

As a developer, I worked about half that time in soft-walled cubicles of various heights and another half in open office environments. I spent a year or so in a shared walled office. As a project guy, I spent about 3 years in an open office and 1 in a shared walled office (2people).<p>With my dev lead and project management hats on, open offices wins hands down. Whenever I want I can stand up and do a quick and dirty eyeball scan of the office and gauge who&#x27;s deep in thought and shouldn&#x27;t be disturbed, who maybe needs help with something, who&#x27;s picking their nose on Facebook. Project goals, milestones, etc. can be on prominent display on the walls, so everyone can easily reference them--no more &quot;oh, I didn&#x27;t know we were releasing next Monday&quot; excuses. Whiteboards all over the place so people can get up and do a quick informal collaboration, then visually reference it later from their desks. Everyone sees everyone all day, bringing an extra bit of team unity, nobody gets to hidey-hole in their office, pretending to not be part of a team. Daily stand-up meeting is quick to set up and painless, it takes a minute for everyone to just get up and walk over to the scrum corner, as opposed to having to lose 10 minutes every time waiting for everyone to decide to come out of their hiding holes. If I do have a quick question, I can tell if they&#x27;re in the middle of something concentrating by just glancing over their way rather than having to knock on their office door (guaranteeing that I disturb them).<p>With my developer hat on, it&#x27;s a bit of a toss up. I can appreciate the benefit of having a quiet, closed-in space to go deep on a problem. And open offices, while they can be quiet if you set basic etiquette rules, will never match the volume level in closed offices. But, in an open office, there&#x27;s zero friction if someone needs to come chat about the code, collaborate, bounce ideas off me, and vice versa. I&#x27;ve never been offended when someone stopped by to discuss a problem they&#x27;re having, or ask to review their approach or code. Sure, it gets you out of &quot;the zone&quot; a bit, but you just get back into it. The whole business about having to waste an hour to get back into the zone after an interruption is, frankly, total BS.  One thing I&#x27;ll say though, is the cubicles are the worst of both worlds: You have the noise level of an open office combined with the high-friction human interaction, collaboration that&#x27;s limited to online tools, and hidey-hole mentality. I&#x27;d take either option over a cubicle any day.<p>I think my ideal office environment is open offices for everyone, but with small private workrooms here and there that people can reserve in 2hr blocks or so, where they can go away into if they really need that occasional alone time to get the job done.",1417648012

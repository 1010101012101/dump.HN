7367021,comment,7365812,7365812,66,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"This is some serious amateur hour. The most glaring problem is this:<p>> There are 255 possible representations of zero. They are all considered to be equal.<p>There are also 255 representations of <i>almost all representable numbers</i>. For example, 10 is 1 x 10^1 or 10 x 10^0 – or any one of 253 other representations. Aside from the fact that you&#x27;re wasting an entire byte of your representation, this means that you can&#x27;t check for equality by comparing bits. Take a look at the the assembly implementation of equality checking:<p><a href=""https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64/blob/master/dec64.asm#L1068-L1105"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64/blob/master/dec64....</a><p>The &quot;fast path&quot; (which is ten instruction) applies only if the two numbers have the same exponent. The slow path calls subtraction and returns true if the result is zero. The implementation of subtraction falls back on yet another function, which jumps around even more:<p><a href=""https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64/blob/master/dec64.asm#L631-L664"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64/blob/master/dec64....</a><p>For most comparisons (no, comparing numbers with the same exponent is not the norm) it will take around FIFTY INSTRUCTIONS TO CHECK IF TWO NUMBERS ARE EQUAL OR NOT. Many of these instructions are branches – and inherently unpredictable ones at that, which means that pipeline stalls will be normal. All told, I would expect equality comparison to typically take around 100 cycles. It&#x27;s not even clear to me that this implementation is correct because at the end of the subtraction, it compares the result to the zero word, which is only one of the 255 possible representations of zero. The lack of a single canonical representation of any number is just as bad for other arithmetic operations and comparisons, if not worse.<p>Crockfords bugaboo with IEEE 754 floating-point is bizarre, verging on pathological. He devoted a section in his book &quot;JavaScript: The Good Parts&quot; to a rather ill-informed rant against it. When I saw him give a talk, I took the opportunity to ask him what he thought would be a good alternative to using IEEE 754. His answer was – I shit you not – &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. Apparently this proposal is the answer. No thanks, I will stick with the amazingly successful, ubiquitous, thoroughly thought out standard, that was spearheaded by William Kahan – one of the greatest numerical analysts of all time. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t appreciate how good we have it with IEEE 754 should really read &quot;An Interview with the Old Man of Floating-Point&quot; [1], in which Kahan relates just how messed up this stuff was before the IEEE 754 standardization process. It should also be noted that there already <i>is</i> an IEEE standard for decimal floating-point [2], which is not only infinitely better thought out than this drivel, but also is already implemented in hardware on many systems sold by IBM and others, specifically for financial applications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal64_floating-point_format"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal64_floating-point_format</a>",1394326418

Logically, the same happens in IEEE754, the difference is that the loss of precision in DEC64 is always a multiple 3.5 bits, whereas IEEE754 can lose precision in decrements of one bit.<p>(</i>) Maybe excluding over/underflow scenarios.<p>To clarify, what you say <i>sounds like</i> (I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not what you meant) every operation with mixed exponent will lead to loss of precision. From my understanding, that is not the case. It also <i>sounds</i> like every IEEE754 operation with mixed exponents only leads to one bit precision loss while it could lead to much more (in fact to (<total number of fraction bits between the two IEEE754 doubles> - 52).",1394326212
7367013,comment,7365812,7366317,4,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"> Interesting approach, rather than normalize to 1 it normalizes to the largest whole number. The positives of this are that you don&#x27;t run into issues with encoding things like .1 that you do in binary<p>Nonsense. Binary floating-point too normalizes to the largest possible significand. It then omits the leading 1 from the representation, since the leading 1 is by definition a 1. That this trick is simple to pull in binary is only one of the advantages of a base-2 floating-point representation.<p>The fact that 0.1 is not representable in binary has nothing to do with the choice of representing it as 0x1999999999999a * 2^-56, because it already is, and that does not make it representable.",1394326149

7366999,comment,7365864,7366887,5,0,ghshephard,,,"Yes Netflix offered that, and that&#x27;s what the Comcast/Netflix paid-peering arrangement accomplishes, albeit in a slightly different manner than if Netflix OpenConnect Appliance had been dropped into a Comcast data center cage.<p>In order to connect to Comcast&#x27;s network you need port capacity on Comcast&#x27;s routers.  Netflix pushes approx. 3 Terabits [1] onto the Comcast network, so they need Comcast to supply (configure, support, monitor, upgrade, power, etc...) approx. 300 10-GigE interfaces, as well as any incremental Line Cards, Routers, Cabinets that might be required to add that port capacity and bandwidth capability to their network.  (3 terabits is enough bandwidth to get your attention)<p>In addition, now that there is an extra 3 terabits of incoming data onto their network, Comcast also has to scale their outgoing network (to the home users) by another 3 terabits as well, so there are incremental costs there.  It could be argued (and I would do so) - that those 3 terabits have <i>already</i> been paid for by the cable-subscribers, and so Comcast should be prepared to provide sufficient capacity to deliver it - but regardless, it&#x27;s an additional cost that Comcast needs to account for, regardless of whether they are installing appliances in their network, or peering with content providers.<p>Comcast provides these peering locations in at least 17 discrete locations in the United States [2] - Many of those locations are just general CoLos - I&#x27;ve heard of about 25% on that list  - so many of them aren&#x27;t &quot;Dedicated Comcast Data Centers&quot; - they are CoLos in which multiple customers can come together and interconnect with each other or carriers such as Level3, Cogent, etc....<p>So, in those facilities, from Comcast&#x27;s perspective, providing Port Capacity is a matter of connecting a fiber patch cable to one of their 10 GigE interfaces, and exchanging some BGP routes with a content provider.<p>It&#x27;s true that there are several routing relationships Comcast can establish with content providers, and some of those relationships might involve placing those Content Providers in AS7922 (Comcast&#x27;s Autonomous System) - but, from a cost perspective, there are a lot of costs that are duplicated, regardless of whether Comcast establishes a peering relationship with Netflix, versus having them route from within Comcast networks.<p>You still need to install 300+ 10 GigE ports and all the associated costs that go along with that, and you still have to provide downstream capacity of 3 Terabits to home subscribers.   Peering with a partner in a 3rd party CoLo instead of having to provide them cabinets/electrical/etc for the appliances avoids those cabinet/appliance costs.<p>Something to keep in mind, is that in addition to providing the three terabits streaming capacity on their network, Comcast would also have to provide Capacity to keep those Appliances &quot;supplied&quot; - each of the appliances would need about five Terabytes of content loaded each night [3, pg 13].  There are also some operational advantages to managing a Content Provider at &quot;arms-length&quot; distance with BGP, versus having to do custom routing on your own network to support them.  Comcast already knows how to peer and interoperate with many carriers/partners using BGP, so no new procedures/technology required to add Netflix to that list.<p>In the end - Netflix and Comcast each negotiated in their own best interests.  Netflix&#x27;s access to the Comcast network was provided in roughly the same way that Content Providers have been getting access to networks for the last 10 years, and, until there is real competition in the broadband market, you&#x27;ll continue to see content providers having to pay to get access to customer eyeballs, whether that&#x27;s through a transit provider, a CDN, or a paid peering relationship like we see here.<p>Now - if end-users could chose from several competitive Broadband providers, then maybe it would have been Comcast paying Netflix in order to provide a higher quality service to their customers so as to differentiate themselves from the other ISPs; at the very least a settlement free peering arrangement would have been much more attractive.  It might be interesting to see what the nature is of paid-peering arrangements with premier content providers like Netflix are like for ISPs who operate in competitive broadband markets.  My guess is that settlement free peering arrangements, and installation of the Netflix Open Connect Appliance are more common in those markets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/02/heres-comcast-netflix-deal-structured-numbers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/02/heres-comcast-netflix...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.comcast.com/dedicatedinternet/servicelocations/default.html?SCRedirect=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comcast.com/dedicatedinternet/servicelocations/de...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://oc.nflxvideo.net/docs/OpenConnect-Deployment-Guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oc.nflxvideo.net/docs/OpenConnect-Deployment-Guide.pd...</a>",1394325657

That will give an uppsr bound on the time something was signed. The lower bound is trivial to provide by the transaction originator - simply sign something using enough timestamp services values as a salt.<p>A timestamp service simply outputs a random number for each previous minute and is available to sign things using the next number.<p>In order to defeat this scheme, an attacker needs to execute a Sybil attack against all the timestamp servers. The only time you really NEED to make something really expensive is to be let in as a timestamp server. This can be done on a reputation system, essentially proof of stake for new miners only. But not for each transaction!",1394325028

But not much of one because the vast majority of the time you are not generating a one time pad.<p>As for forward secrecy, as I understand it, /dev/urandom <i>is</i> constantly updated with more entropy to maintain forward secrecy. In fact it is updated in exactly the same way as /dev/random. The only difference between /dev/urandom and /dev/random is that /dev/random blocks when it deems you have &quot;run out of entropy&quot; (which is really nonsense).<p>So even if the saved seed is compromised, as soon as enough new entropy comes in, /dev/urandom will be secure again. Also note that <i>if</i> the seed is compromised, /dev/random is not much better because it doesn&#x27;t know that the seed has been compromised. So /dev/random will freely produce for you up to N bits of tainted output based on the broken seed, where N is the current entropy estimate.",1394324974

Other implementations surely exist). \nThe only inefficient aspect of the current implementation is that most operations contain two or three conditional jumps, two for the arguments and sometimes one for the possibility of overflow.<p>The way modern, heavily-pipelined processors are designed, any instruction that could possibly need to obtain an address from an address and jump to there would have to be micro-coded. Also, from the instruction dependency point of view, the way modern, heavily-pipelined processors are designed, all instructions dependencies are fetched as early as possible (before the instruction is executing and it is known which may be ignored). This is why cmov is sometimes worse than a conditional branch. The entries of the “previously configured operation table” would need to be fetched all the time. Again, the simplest way not to fetch them all the time would be to micro-code the instruction, meaning that it would take about as much time as a short sequence of instructions that expands to the same micro-instructions.<p>There used to be a way in IA-32/x86_64 to annotate conditional branch instructions with a static prediction (cs: and ds: prefixes), which could be useful regardless of the approach, but nowadays I believe this annotation is ignored altogether.",1394324427

I spent a good amount of time digging through Console.app and finding problem spots in the event logs, running tools like OnyX and CleanMyMac, and digging through various system files. Here&#x27;s what I did to get it running like butter again:<p>* Reboot into recovery mode (hold cmd-R at boot) and run Repair Disk and Fix Permissions in Disk Utility (always a good idea just to catch any disk problems before you get going).<p>* Run EtreCheck (<a href=""http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck</a>) and remove anything described as a problem kext or problem login item. For me the main culprits were Soundflower (used with Audio Hijack) and old versions of Paragon NTFS and extFS.<p>* Open up Font Book, click All Fonts, select all, and pick File > Validate Fonts. Change the dropdown to &quot;Warnings or Errors&quot;, and when the scan finishes choose all the fonts with warnings or errors and remove them. This actually fixed a lot of weird issues with Chrome and other apps.<p>* Run OnyX (<a href=""http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php</a>) and run pretty much every verification, maintenance, and cleaning task. Don&#x27;t forget to go through the sub-tabs in each section. Also, read the help if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Delete ALL the font caches (in the Cleaning tab) and reboot.<p>* Run CleanMyMac (or similar tool) to get rid of old logs, unused garbage, etc. Get rid of any old applications you don&#x27;t use anymore and all their garbage too. Extensions Manager in CleanMyMac will help you track down login items that you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re running.<p>Basically, the problem for me ended up being that I had been migrating my profile, development tools, apps, and other stuff from Mac to Mac since 2005. It seems like everything was mostly ok until Mavericks, when Apple clearly made a lot of changes under the hood and all that really old garbage all over my Mac ended up freaking the computer out.<p>After running all of the above stuff I haven&#x27;t had any of the aforementioned issues. I&#x27;m planning to upgrade this old iMac pretty soon, and I&#x27;ll definitely be starting fresh and not using Migration Assistant. Luckily, everything important these days is synced up with Dropbox or Google Apps (something that wasn&#x27;t so easy in 2010) so it should just be a matter of reinstalling all my applications.",1394324025

When time is extremely limited, you should not be wasting time on building an application architecture. You should be spending all of your time on building features.<p>With generator-egress, you can simply run &quot;yo egress&quot; from the command line, give it a site name, author, and description. After generation and setting your Postgres credentials, you have an express based web app in seconds with: user account join/login functionality, and password encryption via bcrypt.<p>Last Friday I &quot;released&quot; v0.1.0 of generator-egress. On top of my very busy work and school schedule, I was able to build an MVP of a web app in exactly 6 days (10-15 hours total) of development - most of that time was building a database schema and writing SQL queries.<p>Some other features I&#x27;d like to add to egress are supporting different databases, theme customization (currently using vanilla Bootstrap), better error handling, and better input validation.<p>Please take a look at generator-egress. I&#x27;d love to hear some feedback on whether or not this is useful for you, and ways I can improve upon it.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>-Shakeel",1394323357
7366918,comment,7366441,7366779,1,0,Volundr,,,"I agree with you, and I don&#x27;t. With the way many companies seem to treat salary, I&#x27;d certainly rather work hourly, but that&#x27;s really not the way salary is supposed to work (or does where I work).<p>When your hourly, if you start feeling sick in the middle of the afternoon go home, you have to put it on your timecard and it shows on your paycheck. Similarly, if shit hits the fan and you pull an extra 20 hours cleaning it up, you have to put it on your timecard and it shows on your paycheck. Seems fair right? And it is. But both you and your employer are spending a fair amount of effort on simply making sure your <i>time</i> (not work) is accounted for correctly.<p>Salary done right is when both you and your employer agree to skip the bean-counting. They have around, say, 40 hours worth of work they&#x27;d like to hire you to do, and they&#x27;d like to pay you &#x27;x&#x27; much to do it. Now when it&#x27;d a lovely spring day and you decide to take an afternoon walk with your significant other, eh you still get paid the same. All caught up and don&#x27;t feel like being at the office anymore? Eh take off. Whose counting? At the same time when there&#x27;s a fire in the server room and you all pull all nighters bringing things back up, no one needs to waste time figuring exactly how much time you spent.<p>The problem with the way so many companies are doing salary currently is that the company is very happy not to count the extra hours you spend at work, but insist on an exact account of the time you didn&#x27;t. Hell, they usually even go so far as to give you an allotment of time your allowed to not spend at the office. That double standard is the problem with most salaries, not the concept of salary itself.",1394323355

7366910,comment,7364908,7364908,3,0,thinkersilver,,,"Being productive is pure execution of an implementation or an idea. Anything else like planning, thinking through your problem is not deliverable or visible in the final output. Yet these things are necessary. Deciding when and how much to plan and think about your problem becomes a strategic decision. You want to spend the minimum effort required for the most effective solution within your time frame.<p>I&#x27;m almost certain that I have an undiagnosed ADHD, but living in London it is something that is not recognized. Whether this condition exists or not, my attention span is well below that of my peers at work. This lead me to actually find out what the optimal period of time I can concentrate doing something without my mind wandering. I took a timer and over a period of a week I experimented with blocks of time, starting from 25 minutes , I gradually reduced the block by 5 minutes until I found that sweet spot. I expected it&#x27;d be about 15 minutes, but to my dismay it was only 5. WTH!<p>I accepted the results and started each task with the expectation that any task I complete should finish in less than 5 minutes. If it doesn&#x27;t then I&#x27;m either being inefficient because I&#x27;m<p>1) disorganised - spending time looking for artefacts required to do the piece of work\n2) unskilled  - spending most of that 5 minutes not executing but thinking about how to do it.<p>At the end of the box of time. I&#x27;d document what category my inability to complete the task fell into and then I&#x27;d note it somewhere so that at the end of the day I could either spend time getting that area more organized, looking for opportunity for automation or learning so that I become a bit more skilled. Dealing with my disarray and unskilledness at the end of the day helped me work smarter. Intraday, I&#x27;d not have the time to do this, this is where the grind comes in, where you plough through a piece of work knowing that it might not be the best way of doing it but you need get it out the door. The time management system is unnaturally granular. You can quickly put a stop to an unproductive avenues. This has gradually made me a more organized and skilled programmer over the last 3 months. More importantly more productive.  It&#x27;s also given me detailed metrics on my productivity. I can measure my level of distraction, unpreparedness and so on. The odd effect of all of this is that I can work much longer hours without moving from my seat ( I do force myself to get up for breaks)<p>All this is possible because of where technology is now, without it the process is far too granular and unwieldly to be practical.<p>From my experience I agree with what the author said in points 7,8. This is vital.<p>* Haven&#x27;t an objective productivity metric - how do you measure your productivity. \n* Accept that the grind part of the job<p>I think everything else can either fall into the categorys of managing procrastination, motivation and being a bit more organized which can vary widely depending on individual.",1394323268

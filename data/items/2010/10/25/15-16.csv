It would be really interesting to have a (long-lasting) service around raising funds for open-source contributions and bugfixes and connecting users and developers. This could even look like a kind of reverse-kickstarter, where a number of people contribute money to a specific goal and only then find a developer/designer/... via the service.<p>As a sidenote: I always am a bit skeptical when i see links to a HN thread propagated in posts, primarily because it may bring too many new people here in particular if the post gets picked up by major news outlets. Nothing wrong with new users, but I think anyone interested in HN related topics learns of this site sooner or later anyway. The rate of submissions/changes on the front page has increased a lot during the last year and I'm a bit afraid where that will lead to (unless PG starts updating / trying a couple of things with HN, such as thresholds, categories, etc).",1288022235

1830288,comment,1815636,1818059,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"""Hence a prediction: within less than 5 years a Mac will be running on an Apple designed ARM processor.""<p>That assertion presupposes that Apple will give up the professional content creation market entirely. If they've killed off Shake and curtailed developement on Final Cut Pro, then I'g guess that your theory has some merit.<p>The reason? The upcoming 2.5 GHz ARM core will most likely be performance competitive with today's x86, but by the time it comes to market, we'll most likely be looking at a Sandy Bridge refresh, and even the first Sandy Bridge processors will most likely smoke the best that ARM can throw at it.<p>The ARM will almost certainly continue to dominate the low-power markets though. I don't see a high likelihood of x86 making it there. I'd even go out on a limb and suggest that if Intel wanted to compete head-to-head with ARM, their best bet would be a low-power Itanium, since it's not saddled with x86 hardware any more, and therefore requires considerably less logic to match x86 performance with the same manufacturing technology.",1288022104

With WEP every single client uses the same encryption key, so all the packets are visible to everyone. With WPA2-PSK, each client has it's own key which is derived from the pre-shared key. Because of this, your adapter won't decode someone else's packets, but it's technically feasible to do so with other types of attacks outside of the scope of this firefox plugin. I'm not that familiar with the encryption within WPA-Enterprise, but I don't believe you can derive other people's keys and sniff their data when using it.",1288021890

We want to help reduce the risk that's inherent to business growth.<p>We've tried to build our solution to make hiring the best person easy: matching people and employers using experience and personality, which is the most valid predictor of job success (assuming the basic hard skills requirements are met).<p>Feedback from early users was very similar to what I've been reading in these posts: there's real desire for a solution that can (i) find candidates, (ii) identify the best ones, based on how well they fit the personality and experience requirements, (iii) to be able to tell when candidates are stretching the truth/lying, and (iv) revealing the most critical interview questions that are specific/personalized for each candidate. So that's what we built.<p>The solution wasn't built for hard-core tech skills evaluation, but it's really good at finding the cultural/job fit in potential employees.  With that said, we still have a few companies using it to hire for technical roles.<p>I'm posting here because I'm interested in what feedback the group may have.  Remember that we want to keep our tool simple and we're not cool with adding lots of features (a la 37signals' philosophy).<p>If you want to try it, you can be my guest and try it for free to see if it works for you: <a href=""http://clearfit.com/hiring-tool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clearfit.com/hiring-tool</a><p>I'm interested in any suggestions/feedback that any of you may have.",1288018952

Don't let your egos get the better of your words.<p>The obvious domain generalization is a much harder (but hardly impossible) statement to argue:<p><i>Yes, there are people out there who couldn't <use basic building block of their field> if they had to, and have never heard of <some atomic concept they implicitly use every day>. We call them bad programmers. Guess what: they're everywhere.</i><p>So the question becomes ""if you only know how to function within some high level of abstraction are you effective at what you do?"" I'd suggest that this holds pretty well if the level of abstraction you're using is too leaky. I don't have the slightest idea how to time an HD seek operation, but I can write to a file with a great deal of robustness. I think the op has a point though that if you operate mostly with RoR you might be ignorant to a non-trivial amount of detail which will relegate your work to being lower quality.<p>My personal belief is that ""web frameworks"" aren't a sufficiently compartmentalized level of abstraction. RoR holds the opposite philosophy (evidenced by marketing and the opaqueness of Active Record, for instance) which causes a great deal of impedance when you have to dive into lower level concepts which were supposed to have vanished via RoR. So I agree with the op in that if you can only create things using RoR abstractions, you'll probably be in trouble before too long.",1288018828

The answer is, almost as always, ""it depends"".<p>One could take his argument to ridiculous levels and say if you don't fully understand Machine Code and every layer of Abstraction above it, you are doing something wrong.

We're not even able to keep information over thousands of years, how can we be able to big a hole and protect the environment (and our children's children) from radioactive rubbish? If this material is able to somehow get in contact with groundwater we do have a big problem for a whole region. In Germany we do still have forests that none is allowed to eat any fungi - because of Chernobyl which was about 20 years ago and hundreds of miles away...<p>The storage of radioactive material is a huge problem which isn't solved nowadays. Look at the amount of permanent disposal facilities: there is not a single one for that on the whole world. Even the USA do only have temporary facilities to store there highly radioactive material....<p>The 2nd problem is trivial: I do not assume that nuclear power plants are unsafe by default. I really do think that it's hard to crash one and bring it to the point of no return where everything blows up. But we saw a few times that it happened. That's technology, it's never a 100% safe. And that's also my problem. If something happens its not only an accident with a few people hurt but a massive disaster where several hundred people are radioactively contaminated, a whole region is uninhabitable and even your children's children have a great chance to give birth to disabled babies.<p>As I said...it's not that simple. There are a lot of questions still unanswered and this is what we currently see in Japan and saw in Eastern Europe 20 years before. The people will suffer and not only a few years but for generations. If we're able to build more efficient devices and to create other sources of power creation we definitely should do that as we're able to get rid of the (highly unlikely) chance that such a disaster is happening again.<p>If there are alternatives so why don't we use them? Let's see if it is enough technology out there to generative the energy we need. If no one tries, no one knows - there are studies for both sides of this issue but we do have to at least try it...",1347695945

If nobody tries, we'll all certainly fail.<p>I love the hubris, if him or say 20 of his wealthy friends don't solve the problem, I mean who could? Because history shows all advancement is done only by extremely wealthy folks.<p>>Unfortunately, no such technology can completely replace fossil fuels, which provide base-load power all day and night, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. There is no carbon-free base-load power source except nuclear energy.<p>I admit to knowing nothing of this area, but is energy storage just useless? I always hear the 'what about off-cycle demand' used as a cudgel against things like wind/solar/hydro/etc.. power. Is it really impossible / terribly inefficient to store energy for later use? If so is there no chance of advancement there and thus the only hope is something like nuclear? Honest question.<p>>There are few technologies more daunting to inventors (and investors) than nuclear power.<p>I agree investors are more likely to say fund, cat-sharing-social-coupon-web 3.0 venture over say 'long lead new power breakthrough', but something tells me with the sheer buckets of money that would accompany such a discovery that some people are definitely working on it. Whether those people are VC/billionaires or government, something tells me if Myhrvold died tomorrow (please god) that all research in alternative energy wouldn't grind to a halt never to be pursued again.<p>>Like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, I was once a little boy who played with model rockets and aspired to learn nuclear physics.<p>And then go on to troll the world?

Median estimates predict a couple hundred deaths.<p>Even though management was criminally bad, Fukushima still killed fewer people than the equivalent number of coal plants run for the same time. Fukushima ran for 40 years, so that's 25 deaths per year worst-case. According to the CATF[1], around 13,000 Americans die each year from fossil fuel power plant emissions. There are around 600 coal plants in the US, so that's just over 20 deaths per plant per year. What's worse is you need more than one coal plant to make up for a nuclear plant. Googling around tells me coal averages 300MW/plant and Fukushima had 4.7GW of capacity. You'd need 15 coal plants to make up for Fukushima. That's 300 deaths per year.<p>So when the 5th largest earthquake ever recorded strikes, and causes a nuclear power plant to explode <i>twice</i>, and the cleanup is <i>criminally mismanaged</i>, it's <i>still</i> safer than burning fossil fuels.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.catf.us/fossil/problems/power_plants/existing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catf.us/fossil/problems/power_plants/existing/</a>",1347694646

4525573,comment,4522475,4522766,5,0,sbisker,,,"I hired a TaskRabbit to pick up a large amount of IKEA and deliver it to my house. The TaskRabbit proceeded to show up an hour late with the furniture...because she dropped the furniture on her foot, breaking multiple bones.<p>Once I heard this, I realized ""Shoot, <i>I</i> contracted her. Am I legally liable for her injuries?"" (Fortunately for me, she shrugged it off, and seemed to be covered under some insurance of her own.) And if she had <i>not</i> delivered the furniture due to her broken foot, would TaskRabbit make me look like the bad guy for asking for my money back? (Fortunately again for me, she made the delivery, amazingly.)<p>While things turned out OK in the end, suddenly the whole service felt much riskier, for both the employee and the consumer - and I felt irritated at TaskRabbit for subjecting me to that risk without some sort of a safety net in place. (Heck, I would have paid extra for one, some sort of ""TaskRabbit Insurance."")<p>I have to say, as much as I dislike the idea of tight regulations on workers, and can see directly how much cheaper my services are removing those regulations...I think next time I'll pay the premium for a more legitimate furniture move, at least, until the law catches up to services like TaskRabbit.",1347693166
4525572,comment,4523380,4523380,1,0,utopkara,,,"What is needed, is a fast track evaluation of technology claims. The speed can be achieved by streamlining the process of finding the field expert, providing archives and secretarial services during the evaluation, and coaching the expert about the process. The task can be taken up by an industry foundation, which can also drive down the cost.<p>Any expert with some experience in dealing with patents can figure out if a patent in his/her area has any merit. But doing it in court is a different matter, and takes time.<p>The problem is, the court has to do this evaluation by appointing established experts, who don't have much time anyway, so even the search for experts take time. And the experts have to evaluate the claims with respect to historical state of the art at the time of patent application.<p>We are lucky that the internet now remembers most of the past, so we can go back to comments in HN, and say, ""see, people were already talking about that in public at the time of this patent"". But, for older patents, the experts have to dig through conferences, magazines, emails, journals, etc. as reference, and evidence that something was known. Without such diligent work, plainly declaring that an idea is trivial, will not be something an expert will be willing to do in court.<p>All this can be sped up and the costs can be reduced if an organization took the task. I) Hire a group of neutral distinguished academics in several key fields, who will find and appoint technology experts. II) Put together the tools and archives the experts will need in their evaluation. III) Coach the experts about the process, and provide secretarial services during the process.",1347693060

My observations are that India is unable to control the growing fundamentalist Islamic element within its population. Recent riots and pogroms against native North-Eastern Indians (they have a significant East Asian component to their appearance) by Islamic groups is a clear marker of rapidly increasing instability. India as a state is one of those mixed stable-chaos types that is teetering on the brink of disaster. A mafia driven monarchy (Antonina Malno aka Sonia Gandhi) has effectively injected massive corruption into India's state bureaucracy and destroyed the improvements/gains made in the 1990s by civil society types. It is a mess. I would not invest any hope in India unless there's some massive change in their politics.",1347693006

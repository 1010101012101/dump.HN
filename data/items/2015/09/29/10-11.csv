Running generators during not-emergency times will typically get you a nice call/visit from the state&#x27;s environmental agency courtesy of your complaining neighbors. Said agency will ask you to curtail your usage to no more than X hours per month.<p>In the UK, DSR consists of you entering into a contract with National Grid, one or four years in advance, to produce energy during peak times (not just &quot;reduce usage&quot;) at an auctioned rate, but pay a stiff penalty if you fail to deliver.

Even if the number of such people is small, I think we still have a duty to them. We had a choice to build this thing, but they won&#x27;t have a choice about living with it.<p>A cynical view is that the effort that went into the WIPP marker design was an effort to pre-empt objections to it being built. Gregory Benford (a physicist and science fiction author) was part of the design team, and he devoted part of a book, <i>Deep Time</i> [1], to his experience. Whatever the ultimate motivation of the US DOE and others, it seems like the design team took the ethical component of their task seriously.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.physics.uci.edu/~silverma/benford.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physics.uci.edu/~silverma/benford.html</a>",1443522338

10295403,comment,10294833,10295287,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Craft and art exist on a continuum, there is no break between them. Often people who are not or do not know artists imagine that the creation of art entails some magical skill, some special step that is lacking in craft work or engineering work. That some &quot;quintessence&quot; is injected into the process which breathes a vitality of art into the work that would otherwise be absent. But this is a false impression of art. the creation of art is precisely as you say, putting together well-known patterns to build something, sometimes something new.<p>Wood-working using the skills of working the lathe, the chisel, the rasp is fundamentally the same sort of thing as painting using brush strokes. And both skills can be used to create either a work of art or a work of craftsmanship. It&#x27;s a matter of skill and intent. Fundamentally though, creating a painting, a poem, or a song is mostly craftsmanship, it&#x27;s the application of skills to build something in a familiar way.<p>There&#x27;s no magic breath of life that elevates a crafted work into the realm of art, rather it&#x27;s the purpose it&#x27;s made for and other factors which make that distinction. Something that is considered &quot;not art&quot; would typically be something that is completely unoriginal and has a purely practical purpose.<p>Art, on the other hand, tends to involve creativity and originality, it tends to not just be for a practical purpose but also to be evocative, emotional, and communicative.<p>You see, the method and skills of construction are not the differentiator here. Both a EULA and a sonnet can use the same medium (written language) yet while one is purely practical and ordinary the other communicates more than mere facts and details, involves some degree of originality and creativity, and engages the reader at a higher level.<p>Software dev is a very wide ranging field, so it is difficult to talk about it holistically. However, in my experience it does not fit the description of unoriginal rote work. Often there is creativity and originality, as well as subtlety and fine artisanship. It is a new kind of thing which does not neatly fall into either the manufacturing/engineering/&quot;craft&quot; or &quot;art&quot; buckets, and for that reason it requires different ways of thinking about the work and the workers.<p>The most important point here is that when you give craftsmen the task of making 20 chairs, they will do so. Some with greater efficiency than others. But this task is nonsensical when it comes to software, because it is only ever necessary to make one of a thing in software, copies are free (or as nearly so as makes no practical difference). Instead the equivalent task would be to make 20 different chair <i>designs</i>. And now it becomes more clear that we are not dealing with craftsmanship, we are dealing with design work. Creative work. The closest analog to which is art. And how do you judge an order of magnitude difference in design work? How do you objectively measure the difference between an Eames lounge and plastic patio furniture? Objectively you can&#x27;t, but subjectively we are aware that the difference between middle of the road design and top tier design is much more than a single order of magnitude.",1443522283

Maybe this is a privileged reaction, but in USA is that sum worth all the trouble of even a &quot;successful&quot; murder, let alone the calamity this turned out to be? Morality helps morons more than it helps rational people. A rational person would realize that a disagreement over $6000 will be much less hassle over the long term than a murder conspiracy. Someone to whom that is not obvious, and who also lacks enough moral sense not to murder in such a situation, really is a threat to the public. Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t kill him, and maybe a long prison sentence isn&#x27;t the best answer, but at the very least the public ought to be warned that this guy is completely irrational and might decide to murder for no good reason at all.",1443520992

Try thinking of it as an idiom instead of a library.  If you honestly think that all syntax that can be described as shorthand has no point you&#x27;re missing a lot of expressiveness.  That attitude tends to lead to littering code with the kind of laboriously spelled out replacements for the standard library that someone new to a language is prone to.<p>Is your background mainly Java or perhaps K&R-era C?  I can understand how coming from that you might not be used to the little convenient tweaks you can make to a more dynamic language.",1443520872

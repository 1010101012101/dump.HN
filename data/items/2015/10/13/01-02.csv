If you are in an urban area, where the sidewalks are crowded, and cars can&#x27;t get up to high speed before the next stoplight, then certainly bikes should be on the street.  If you are in a suburban area, where sidewalks are empty and cars travel at easily twice your maximum speed, then the streets are not safe for biking.",1444701534

Below is a list of a few companies that were built by a female founder/co-founder. The unpopular view that this &quot;problem&quot;, will fix itself, is somewhat true in my opinion. There will be a day when a list like the one below doesn&#x27;t exist, there will be a single one. Females (and everyone really) realize tech. is one of the most important components of the future and there are many shows/movies/media that reflect this societal change.<p>Until then, if you think the world would be better off with more woman in tech, help get young people excited about technology and entrepreneurship. The ecosystem is primarily men who started companies internet companies in the early days, which have splintered into tons of new ventures and startups largely comprised of people from those companies.<p>The list below are great companies (well, a couple have rough patches but what doesn&#x27;t) and there doesn&#x27;t need to be a qualifier like &quot;woman&quot; founded.

Here&#x27;s a mental exercize for all the men who think this way:\nYou have to go to a conference, and the whole place is filled with big, muscular, thug-looking men. You walk around and you notice they&#x27;re all staring at you. Every now and then when you stop, one or two will approach you, and they will do it with <i>that</i> look in their eye. You know, like you&#x27;re their prison meat. So the huge thug comes up to you and starts some small talk, asks your name, what you do, if you&#x27;re there by yourself, and then, you know, he says you have a nice little ass, and wouldn&#x27;t you want to go there in the back with him. He&#x27;s just talking, you know, didn&#x27;t touch you or anything. Plus, it&#x27;s a public place. You&#x27;re just unconfortable because he is a huge guy, looks like a mma fighter, but, hey, he&#x27;s just talking to you, saying he wants to have sex with you. No big deal, right? You just deal with him and all the others and won&#x27;t make a fuss about this behavior, and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll attend all future conferences with a great mood and won&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with all the thugs wanting to have sex with you.\nThugs are like that.

Your manager should know and accept this.<p>The best you can do is probably this: Repeatedly split the project into tasks, estimate the time it will take for each, until the next task takes several hours, and then do the next task.   Keep track of estimates and actual times spent.   Your manager should ask you to do this and keep it updated.   Joel Spolsky wrote something similar here: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000245.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000245.html</a> (I&#x27;m sure I read similar advice elsewhere, but can no longer find it.)<p>It should go without saying that you should include unit testing, code review, debugging, etc. in your estimates.   And, of course, making and updating the time estimates.<p>The project, when &quot;complete&quot;, will still usually require maintenance, so work on the project only stops when the software is no longer used.<p>You should never be given deadlines, as you won&#x27;t know in advance what problems you might encounter, and the quality of your work (and probably your health) will suffer.   This will result in a build up of technical debt, increasing maintenance costs.<p>It&#x27;s well worth reading The Mythical Man-Month, especially if you&#x27;re managing a project, or working with others on the same project.",1444701460

But as a result?<p>So these are typically some combination of dynamic and stochastic difference equations that are supposed to mimic the real economy and may not have any analytical solution. The goal is to include different types of shocks, different inputs, and different functional forms and run simulations to see if the output shows the same patterns as the real economy.<p>What we tend to find in these models is that we can easily get some of the characteristics to match while others do not: i.e. matching the volatility in unemployment while also matching the volatility in wages, output, consumption, etc.<p>This is more along the lines of trying to be engineers rather than mathematicians. Which I&#x27;m fine with. My issue is  (1) the supposed relationships we are trying to match are not guaranteed across nations or time. Thus even if the model is describing a certain period of time very accurately, it isn&#x27;t useful at all in general. And (2) we take these models and get the resulting parameter values from the simulation that is at best good at describing some of the stuff happening in the economy and treat them like they apply to the real world (an example parameter might be the risk aversion of consumers in the economy).<p>We then use these parameters to describe what changes should be made to the economy in the event of certain types of shocks.<p>And if I&#x27;m being honest, my biggest complaint for these models stems from the idea that they all need magical micro-foundations in order to be considered realistic. This stems from the Lucas Critique and is likely the biggest travesty of economics in its history as a science. It is along the lines of saying general relativity isn&#x27;t realistic, because it needs to be built using quantum mechanics.<p>What absolutely kills me is that many economists obviously compartmentalize academic research from what they suggest doing in the real world (this can be seen by the fact that the majority of economists polled supported the stimulus in the U.S., felt that it helped recovery from the recession, or at least kept it from getting worse).",1444699786

I&#x27;ve seen three phase 25A circuit breaker catch fire from being run at slight overload for few weeks.<p>For home/office installations in 230V systems, almost any dead short is enough to trip circuit breaker (and probably several of them in the current path), regardless of wire cross sections involved, as the fault loop impedance will still be small enough to cause >100A of fault current.<p>Common cords with CEE 7/7 plug on one end and IEC C13 on the other have 0.75mm^2 conductors, which seems to be sufficient for the 10A/70C rating. Two wire lamp cords (and Europlug->C7 cables) are also 0.75m^2. Normal three wire extension cords are 1.0mm^2 or 1.5mm^2 depending on length and (trustworthiness of) manufacturer. Recently, there are also two wire extension cords (CEE 7/17 -> CEE 7/17 &quot;socket&quot; for things like lawnmowers and Europlug -> Europlug socket for who knows what), these usually are 0.75mm^2.<p>In Czech republic, copper wiring in walls for sockets and lighting tends to be almost universally 1.5mm^2 with 2.5mm^2 used for long runs or industrial installations. It&#x27;s my understanding that current Czech wiring standards essentially removed any ampacity->crosssection tables and derating factors and only specify allowed resistance of the wire run and it&#x27;s temperature rise under load. I assume that something similar is also true across rest of the EU.",1444699229

My apologies.<p>Let me offer my opinion on where this sort of thing comes from.<p>Why would someone say something like that?<p>Well, because voting on HN (and other platforms) is still broken.  People will down-vote you simply because they don&#x27;t like what you are saying or if you are saying something that paints a different light on their hero, ideology, etc.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the strength or quality of the argument at all.  And, because of this, it also does not open the doors for discussions.<p>For those of us who might not align with the most prevalent culture on HN (pick a topic, there&#x27;s a favored ideology) this can be rather frustrating at times.  You have rules for all sorts of things but no enforceable rules for when and how to down-vote and people don&#x27;t have to justify their down-vote in any way at all.  I have the ability to down-vote yet I don&#x27;t remember when and if I have ever exercised it.  Because, for the most part, I don&#x27;t feel it is a fair system.<p>Personally, I think down-voting ought to be eliminated because it is conducive to emotional or ideological abuse, particularly by the younger members of the audience.  Up-voting is a far more positive type of engagement and one where if you don&#x27;t like the argument you simply do nothing about it or pick the one you think might be better.  With software limiting such things as rate-of-voting and mass up-voting one could make it far more civil.  For example, a reader might get only two or five up-votes per thread or some such thing.<p>Sometimes you look at topics where, perhaps, you&#x27;d like to contribute some experience and the first thought is &quot;crap, if I write anything on this I am going to be showered with down-votes&quot; and that&#x27;s where, sometimes, making that comment comes from.<p>I would urge you to view such comments not as rules violations but rather a symptom of something that might need to be addressed.<p>Facebook is dealing with this right now with their like/don&#x27;t-like voting system.  Their reasons and platform are different, of course.<p>Learning does not happen when everyone agrees with you.  A healthy dose of counterpoint is how you learn.  I know it&#x27;s difficult to manage these kinds of fora, I&#x27;ve done it in the past, back in USENET days, and it was a nightmare.  Your job isn&#x27;t easy.  Just take what I said as constructive criticism and nothing more.  HN is excellent, so you are doing something right.<p>Thanks.",1444698739

There&#x27;s a very big discrepancy in France between normal restaurants priced less than 20 euros per person for lunch without wine and the gourmet more expensive restaurants.<p>People also go out to restaurants a lot less than in Japan so there are less restaurants in France. In Japan, Osaka has 16,000  restaurants. Tokyo has 55,000 restaurants. Paris only has 14,000.<p>Even restaurants that are not very expensive (1000 yens lunches) in Japan tend to only use homemade ingredients. They don&#x27;t use pre-made sauces.  The average quality of normal restaurants is much higher and a lot of the Chefs at those restaurants are actually passionate about the  food and try hard to improve their skills.<p>So, it&#x27;s simple, Japan is a country with at least twice the number of restaurants per population as France and with a much higher percentage of passionate chefs that want to improve their skills and are there for the love of food rather than for earning money. It&#x27;s actually surprising that Japan still has so little Michelin stars.<p>As for michelin stars, I actually trust the Gault et Millau guide a lot more in France, they don&#x27;t care as much about the atmosphere and the service, they care about the food and ultimately that&#x27;s the only that matters for me.",1444698019

Probability and stats: For probability, work through John Tsitsiklis&#x27;s MIT OCW course 6.041. There is also an archived version of the course available on EDX. Norman Matloff&#x27;s book (<a href=""http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/PLN/ProbStatBook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/PLN/ProbStatBook....</a>) approaches stats from a CS practitioner&#x27;s point of view (lots of sample simulation code in R), and has intuitive explanations of many different statistical concepts. For Hypothesis testing, checkout the courses Mathematical Biostatistics - 1 and 2 on Coursera.<p>2. Linear Algebra: Gilbert Strang&#x27;s OCW lectures / course notes is hands down the best resource. But depending on your mathematical background, the lectures can be a bit long-winded.<p>3. Programming proficiency: For algorithms, Robert Sedgewick&#x27;s algorithms course on Coursera has excellent videos. His textbook is very well written too. I really like his style of writing actual working code for each algorithm he describes (in contrast to say, CLRS): i find his code samples rather elegant and worthy of study. For learning object orientation and design patterns, the best way is to write large programs and read the book &quot;Head First Design Patterns&quot; as you do so.<p>The aim is to develop an ability to <i>think</i> with a statistical / algorithmic lens. Many real world phenomena are stochastic in nature. Modelling them by simulation and measuring and drawing confidence intervals around your measurements must become second nature. When confronted with an image / text processing problem, representing you data as vectors and manipulating them must be natural. While writing large programs, being aware of design considerations such as preferring composition must come naturally to you. Of course, you should be able to always recognize when a computation is O(n^2) vs O(n log(n)) vs O(2^n).<p>Once you are done with that, all you need to do is work through Andrew Ng&#x27;s Machine Learning course and compete in a  few Kaggle competitions / build some ML related side projects. Congratulations, you are now a data scientist good enough to work at most places in the tech industry!;)",1413122153

8445252,comment,8444634,8445202,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"TAL as it was implemented for ZOPE was a total abortion (especially when they threw in other crap to make up for its gaping weaknesses like TALES, METAL, and those goofy expression what were not anything like any other language, plus &quot;acquisition&quot; which was a terrible and useless approach to scoping). The ZOPE stack&#x27;s approach to templating and scoping and components and their entire way of thinking about it was totally demented and wrong headed. I used it a lot in my wild and crazy ZOPE days, and I hated it then and won&#x27;t ever go back.<p>On the other hand, there are other similar attribute based xml templating languages that are much much better, because they didn&#x27;t try to reinvent the wheel out of tapioca and rusty iron filings, but instead they simply acted as a thin veneer over Python, so everything you knew about and could do in Python applied without any distortion or unnecessarily creative reinterpretation.<p>Specifically, TurboGears used the &quot;Kid&quot; templating language, the next generation of which was re-implemented as &quot;Genshi&quot;. I have used both extensively, and although they do have some problems and limitations (many of which Genshi addressed), I really like them a lot, and they are easy to use and think about, and not so full of surprises and disappointments as the horrible stuff from ZOPE that they (distantly) descended from. I&#x27;ve used Kid and then Genshi in large template-heavy projects over many years, and I still use Genshi and like it. It is actually quite elegant and minimalistic, and super easy to learn.<p><a href=""http://genshi.edgewall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genshi.edgewall.org/</a><p>Genshi operates on pure clean XML internally, has real Python loops, conditionals, variables, functions, parameter passing and extensibility, and has plug-in serializers for various formats like XML, XHTML and HTML5, that know about all the formatting rules and conventions and browser quirks and superstitions like <BR />, and never produce incorrectly quoted or formatted content.

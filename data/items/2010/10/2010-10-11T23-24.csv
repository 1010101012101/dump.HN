Having said that, it's also a 'psychological hack' in that it helps me make a decision over which word to use. Somehow, knowing that one word is used even slightly more often than another seems to give me more confidence in using that particular word than if I simply flipped a coin... unless, of course, the number of searches is the same for each word!

1781773,comment,1780348,1781348,0,0,rpheath,,,"I was blown away by the newsletter earlier today. It felt like I got punched in the stomach by Rocky Balboa himself.<p>In the beginning I considered the same billing service providers that I'm sure every other Chargify customer has considered (Spreedly, Cheddargetter, Recurly, etc). The main differentiator was your pricing model. It was the fact that I could launch my product and see if I could get to those first 50 customers before I had to pay you. You made it almost a no-brainer because of your pricing, it was perfect for people like me just starting out. It was inspiring that you were putting trust and hope in your customers. 10 months later, I'm completely integrated with Chargify, have an app in the wild with <i>real</i> users, and boom... All of a sudden Spreedly, Cheddargetter, Recurly, etc are looking <i>a lot</i> better.<p>Aside from the massive price increase, I (like many of your beta users) spent a year testing out your application and giving you a lot of feedback to improve your product. I have also responded to several of the ""[name] is looking at Chargify, can anyone help us out?"" tweets and have said nothing but great things about Chargify since day one. I have helped several of your customers via email, support forums, blogs, and twitter with integration issues, and more-or-less evangelized your product. And I'm happy to do that for great services, and I'm guessing I wasn't the only one. But this was all under the impression that what I signed up for was what I was, well, signing up for.<p>Receiving that newsletter made me feel like I was (we all were) being used to help establish Chargify as a viable option, only to get shit on in the end... and that sucks. It's a horrible feeling.<p>I understand your needs for a price increase and that you can't support freemium at a massive scale, but to be honest, even $39/month is $39 more than what I signed up for considering the first 50 customers were free. I never have needed (and probably never will need) to call you on the phone, so I'd be happy to be on a plan where 24/7 phone support isn't an option.<p>It seems like your early beta testers and customers, who shouted to the world how great Chargify was, should if nothing else at least be given exactly what they signed up for. Now I'm just getting started, so I don't know the ins and outs of business, but that seems like an obvious play to me.<p>Unfortunately, there's now a big lack of trust in Chargify... what will happen to its customers in 2 or 3 years from now when we're even more locked in? After this move, that's a little scary, and potential grounds for departure.",1286841501

I know that that may be very difficult for you at this point but you are literally killing the chargify brand with how you go about this.<p>Go back to where you were 24 hours ago, then make <i>very</i> careful moves forward in concert with your userbase. You can still do it, wait a bit longer and the window of opportunity will close. As soon as people start to throw their dreams in to the garbage and notify their end users because of changes you have made chargify might as well close up shop. Ocean liners do not turn on a dime, they'll break and sink.<p>If the goal of all this is to shake out the 'free' tier remember that each and every business starts at zero.<p>The best thing you could probably do is to find a way to put a sunset clause on the free deal in concert with your users, reasonable terms all around and then to create a limited time free offer which will automatically convert in a model that covers your costs. If they grow over that you will recoup the loss of the initial free signups.<p>The data you have amassed on your customers profiles will need to be brought in on figuring out what kind of model will work best for both you <i>and</i> your customers. My bet would be that the model that matches the chargify demographic best would be one that cuts a merchant 180 days of slack to get going, after which they enter several tiered schemes where the cost per transaction goes down as the volume goes up.<p>Users don't care how you want to serve them, they care that they will be served in a way that works for them, and to tack on a fixed fee where there was none before is a way that does not work for lots of your users. If you think that only the small ones will be affected you can bet that if you don't work this out in a good way that the big ones will be looking to bail as fast as they can as well.<p>You made a mistake, the fix compounded the mistake (I know that from your perspective it looks like meeting them more than halfway but it really doesn't, $40, at 10 sales per month works out to $4 per sale, at 20 sales it is still $2 per sale and at 40 sales you are getting in to 'reasonable' territory.<p>If the support costs are what is killing you then work on reducing them further, excellent guides and a team of super users to help out the newbies.<p>Freemium does not mean 'yesterday you were all free, today you're all premium'.<p>good luck!",1286840711

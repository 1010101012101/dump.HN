Unless you believe mind is somewhere else, if you freeze the brain you freeze the mind.<p>> <i>Present evidence that the mind is present and intact in a frozen brain.

Reprogramming viruses is a start and a way to possibly bootstrap our own nanotech. There is nothing blocking us in principle except &quot;it sounds too crazy to be true&quot;.<p>> <i>4) Again, you are just asserting things. You are making a positive claim and you need to present evidence.</i><p>Evidence that nanotech works? Every single living thing around you. Evidence that we already can use it to build stuff? Just google around.

But you are just pulling that out of the air without evidence or even a good explanation or any reasoning.</i><p>The line of reasoning is like this: we will most likely need some form of nanotech to repair damages done to brain cells by freezing, unless you can think of another method that would preserve the structure. This technology is based on manipulating stuff on molecular level. Since dirt contains most of the things we need to build pretty much anything (what do you think living organisms are built from?), then cheap assembly of non-living things a) seems a much easier problem than fixing living stuff, and b) can be done by simpler versions of the said technology.<p>The detailed lines of reasoning can be found in Drexler&#x27;s &quot;Engines of Creation 2.0&quot; (<a href=""http://www.wowio.com/users/product.asp?BookId=503"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wowio.com/users/product.asp?BookId=503</a>) and other works referenced there.<p>> <i>6) I have a canvas with the original painting of the mona lisa that was made before the one we can now see at the museum. You&#x27;re lucky! I would like to sell it to you! Please note that you can not see the painting at the moment because it has been preserved by a sophisticated technique called &quot;meh&quot;. So the canvas might look empty at the moment but future nanotechnology will be able to restore it. Interested?</i><p>Explain to me how &quot;meh&quot; method works. How it preserves information contained in the painting. If it makes physical and information-theoretical sense, then maybe I&#x27;ll consider buying it :P.<p>It&#x27;s hard to present examples for technology that we don&#x27;t really have right now, but there&#x27;s this concept of reasoning from first principles, and the said principles do not prohibit molecular nanotechnology better that the one already existing (that is, life).<p>See also:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_machine#Examples_of_molecular_machines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_machine#Examples_of_...</a><p><a href=""http://www.cosmolearning.com/courses/richard-feynman-lecture-on-nanotechnology-tiny-machines-473/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cosmolearning.com/courses/richard-feynman-lecture...</a>",1371639082

Probably because there wasn&#x27;t that much in it for Google, since wasn&#x27;t a big national shitstorm blowing that way. But now there is. That is the point I am making.<p>Yes.

Would that make Google an awesome person? No, it would still be a selfish corporate entity trying to get money, just like it always has been</i>
>>> <i>But, it would (rightly) be perceived as a force for good, on the right side of this particular battle with tyranny. That would help you, me, America, and the world... but it would also help Google, it would seem.</i><p>Even in 2009, all those huge corporations were well aware of the &quot;rise of the secret police&quot;, because all of them were either already participating in PRISM, or in the process of being strong-armed into doing so. <i>Had they perceived fighting this kind of evil to be in their own self-interest, they would have done it right from the start</i>. They could even have joined their forces in opposing the government, but they chose to remain silent. <i>Not a word</i> about the systematic raping of people&#x27;s privacy all over the world.<p>PRISM was just as evil in 2009 as it is now, and taking a stand against evil was the right thing to do in 2009, just like it is now. Parading around as some kind of paragon of corporate virtue while <i>secretly shitting all over your users&#x27; privacy</i>, on the other hand, was something that <i>only Google did</i>. Also, if a highly intelligent bunch of people running a powerful corporation is interested in fighting the rise of the secret police, it&#x27;ll be aware that&#x27;s something that should be done <i>right away</i> instead of after waiting around for several years for the situation to get even worse.<p>Google can&#x27;t be <i>rightly</i> seen as a &quot;force for good&quot;, no matter how eagerly you swallowed their disingenuous PR-bullshit about the joys of being Open back in 2009.<p>>>> <i>but once the outrage is in place, that helps align the interests of corporate behemoths like Google with what you and I would probably agree is Good (i.e., not having fucking secret police using secret laws to evade the control by the citizens of the nation).</i><p>It&#x27;s important to realize that they&#x27;ve already proven they simply don&#x27;t give a fuck.

5904730,comment,5904031,5904583,3,0,reitzensteinm,,,"> To provide baseload-ish power, you need multiple installations to cover that different areas receive power at different times in a stochastic fashion and you need backup plants just in case your multiple solar farms are shady or the wind stops in multiple places.<p>Absolutely, and the different areas you need to cover have to be <i>very</i> far apart, most likely distributed over multiple countries. This is covered in the excellent Without Hot Air:<p><a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_187.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/c26/page_187.shtml</a><p>&quot;Between October 2006 and February 2007 there were 17 days when the output from Britains 1632 windmills was less than 10% of their capacity. During that period there were five days when output was less than 5% and one day when it was only 2%.&quot;<p>So if you build half your capacity in solar and half in wind, you&#x27;ll find edge cases where it&#x27;s night and the wind isn&#x27;t blowing, and you&#x27;re suddenly generating <i>1%</i> of capacity overnight.<p>This is aggregated over the UK, which is a very small country, but it still highlights the magnitude of the problem.<p>There are quite a few potential solutions, none of them good; country scale storage (a Tesla can power an average American home for more than a day). Solar thermal, where if you store enough molten salt you can generate at night. Triaging all power usage with a smart grid, so most stuff just turns off. A damn near worldwide grid with HVDC. Keep an entire grid worth of fossil fuel plants in reserve.<p>But in any case, it&#x27;s not nearly as simple as matching wind MW for MW with coal, something which seems to get missed a lot, especially when discussing Germany.<p>(I feel like a broken record recommending this book all the time, but it really is fantastic for hackers interested in energy).",1371637826
5904729,comment,5903423,5904449,6,0,gjm11,,,"(Danger: very very handwavy calculations ahead. Treat the result with caution, or even contempt.)<p>One photon of light at wavelength lambda has energy hc/lambda and momentum h/lambda; in other words momentum = energy / c. If the asteroid is near earth then it&#x27;s getting about 1kW/m^2 of light energy from the sun. So for each m^2 of area and each second of time, that&#x27;s 1e3 / 3e8 kg m/s ~= 3e-7 kg m/s of momentum; if the asteroid is, say, 99942 Apophis then its mass is 4e10 kg; let&#x27;s call it 3e10 kg, for a net acceleration of 1e-17 m/s^2 per square metre of area. If adding the mirrors replaces absorption with perfect reflection, then that&#x27;s also the size of the change in acceleration they produce.<p>According to Wikipedia, which is always right (except when it&#x27;s wrong), averting a collision t years in the future requires a velocity change on the order of 0.035/t m/s.<p>If we assume (this seems pretty damn dubious to me, but never mind) that the effect of our extra momentum from sunlight accumulates &quot;perfectly&quot; over time, and if we suppose we have 10 years&#x27; warning, and if we handwave away some details, then each m^2 of mirror gets us 1e-17 m/s^2 * 3e8 s = 3e-8 m/s of velocity change, and we need 3.5e-3 m/s. So we&#x27;d need about 10^5 m^2, or a patch 300m on each side. That&#x27;s a lot of bees.<p>In practice, you won&#x27;t get perfect momentum, and the asteroid may not always hold the same face to the sun, and the changes may not accumulate in the way you want and may be in an ill-chosen direction, and all the numbers above are only approximations, etc., etc., etc., so you probably need more than that to have much confidence of saving the earth.",1371637803

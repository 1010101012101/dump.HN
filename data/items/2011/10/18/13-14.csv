3125179,comment,3122918,3124688,2,0,ctdonath,,,"Sorry if my 6-sentence post failed to provide encyclopedic coverage of the issue. (Snarky start aside...)<p>I'm a bit confused by the prevalence of the ""so how do they cook it?"" question in such discussions when I point out that one can live sustainably, if not well, on very little. It's as though many have never gone camping and cooked over a fire. Gas/electric stoves and metal cookware are recent developments which humans got by without for a long time - and many still do. For starters, shish-kabobs come to mind for cooking veggies on a stick.<p>In a cramped/austerity situation, little actually needs cooking, given that much can be either eaten raw, or just dried and eaten straight or reconstituted as needed. What needs cooking can be over a fire using the dried inedible remainder of the plants. Stir-fry  Solar ovens are not hard to build. High-tech solutions, at the other extreme, could provide very efficient heat sources. (We need not abandon high- and future-tech for high-population-density scenarios; to the contrary, there would be great motivation to advance technology to match demands for efficiency.)<p>Desertification correlating with population growth? Will have to look into it more. Causation is not obvious (which influences which how & more?). Seems people _are_ figuring out how to feed a population with little resources, translating to sustainability with small per-capita footprint.<p>BTW: Gladwell's ""Outliers"" spends a lot of time researching how ancient/remote/low-tech/cramped/austerity populations managed to feed themselves with few farming resources. For one, Japanese rice farming was a tour-de-force of squeezing as many calories out of a very limited space per capita. Worth a read.",1318946259

By keeping the market fragmented they have more leverage over the platforms (Apple, Amazon, Netflix), and it they hope to gain more control (and money) over the long term.<p>In the short term I think this actually hurts both the platform owners and the content providers because it's so much easier to download the content illegitimately right now.",1352307598

I'm actually a little behind with my chemistry, but you can electrolyze NaCl (salt) when dissolved in water, without melting it. The basic requirement is that the solution contains ions. Now I must admit that I don't know the basic reactions of urea with water, but given that you can use urea as hydrogen source in fuel cells [1] I'd assume that it should work as hydrogen source in an electrolytic process since the basic reaction is somewhat similar.<p>[1] see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea#Laboratory_uses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea#Laboratory_uses</a><p>Edit: There are papers about direct electrolysis of urea<p><a href=""http://www.suttonfruit.com/pics/urea_electrolysis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suttonfruit.com/pics/urea_electrolysis.pdf</a> (I think its a copy of <a href=""http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2009/CC/b905974a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2009/CC/b90597...</a>)<p><a href=""http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Singh%20Deepika.pdf?ohiou1258349080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Singh%20Deepika.pdf?ohi...</a><p>Now I don't know how legit they are, but seems ok to me.",1352307570

The purpose of this is to allow you to easily fork the main repo to add your own plugins and themes to it, while the submodule continues to pull from the system repo.  It's very beneficial from a maintenance standpoint.<p>I'm not sure how to explain the community.

Instead, it is much easier to talk about the actual reality minorities in the US face in regards to political and social systems and how those systems affect their existence. Such systems and policies that continue to keep economic opportunity and education out of the hands of people of color need to be addressed, and a race related policy like affirmative action is just one such tool to address those problems.<p>> I doubt you believe that all 2^(6 billion) subsets of humanity are worthy of moral consideration, however.

To bring this home, if you think the choice between two political candidates amounts to a choice between the lesser of two evils, then the parties have failed us completely and ought to be ousted. <i>Both of them.</i><p>I highly recommend every American read it. The prose is beautiful. [Here's the full text.](<a href=""http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp</a>)<p>A couple of excerpts concerning the warning against political parties:<p>>One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.<p>Political parties are deceptive and divisive...<p>>They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.<p>Parties can get co-opted by those with the time and means to do so. For example, the 0.01%. The Koch brothers, etc. And government becomes a fight between the parties instead of an operating government. Sound familiar?<p>>However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.<p>People who control the parties may become ladder kickers. Removing the things that helped them rise to power, so that they cannot be easily usurped once ensconced. Like the Romney family. Mitt's father was a beneficiary of the social programs Romney claims to want to terminate. The very definition of a ladder kicker.<p>>The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.<p>Democrat vs. Republican.<p>>The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.<p>Yeah, he saw [this](<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2nzBwb5Cea4/T9KJYicYRFI/AAAAAAAARtU/ncNwyxEpAS0/s1600/march_of_tyranny.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2nzBwb5Cea4/T9KJYicYRFI/AAAAAAAARt...</a>) coming too. Parties take precedence over the people themselves, and when coopted by special interests, such as our 0.01%, or big business, turn into a nightmare.<p>>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.<p>Keep an eye on political parties.<p>>It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.<p>[These are now called wedge issues.](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue#Wedge_politics_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue#Wedge_politics_in_t...</a>) Ostensibly issues everyone cares about, but really a tool to separate us into chunks and have us at each others' throats while those actually in power do as they please while we are fighting amongst each other over issues that ought not be the government's business.",1352305909

4753930,comment,4752254,4753589,6,0,king_jester,,,"> Marijuana use will probably at least double as a result of this bill. Unfortunately, this has a real cost to society. There's not a lot of quality data on the health effects of regular pot use, but what I've read says it's something of a mix of the effects of alcoholism and cigarette addiction. This is going to have a real dollar cost to the state unless we can fix our healthcare system before people who start taking up pot now that it's legal start getting cancer in 10-15 years.<p>There is a lot wrong with this bit here. First, I'm not sure where you are finding a figure that cannabis use will double post-legalization. The actual count of users of cannbis isn't fully accurate due to the illegal nature of using it and places that have purused legalization or decriminalization efforts have actually seen a falling trend in cannabis consumption.<p>Second, the effects of regular pot use ARE NOT like alcoholism or smoking. Cannabis does not have a physical addiction characteristic like alcohol or cigarettes, the method of operation on the body is completely different from alcohol and cigarettes, and research on the health effects of cannabis have been extremely limited due to the schedule I status of cannabis in the US. Granted there may be health issues associated with cannabis usage, but the problem is not well understood and will not be well understood so long as cannabis is schedule I and research on it restricted at the federal level.<p>Third, legalizing cannabis does have a real dollar cost as it relates to health care, but this isn't a sign to continue to keep cannabis illegal, but rather to fix the fundamental structural problems of health care in the US. Also, it is not clear that there is a causal relationship between some types of cancer and regular cannabis use, and amounts of cannabis consumed by regular users is highly variable. Further, combustion is not the only way to consume cannabis, so the association here with cannabis being a smoking type drug is quite wrong, and in fact many folks with smoke sensitivity do not consume cannabis this way at all.<p>I agree that like any legal change, there are costs associated with legalizing cannabis, but those costs are so much cheaper than what we have going on today in the US and in the countries where the war on drugs has resulted in tremendous violence and political instability.",1352305798

So let's say 5,000 fraudulent votes went to candidate A.  In a popular vote system, that's unlikely to swing the verdict because that's such a tiny margin compared to the country's entire electorate.  5,000 is less than 0.004% of the number of people who voted in 2008.<p>But Florida historically polls close - easily close enough for 5,000 votes to swing which way the state goes.  And this winner wouldn't just pick up that tiny sliver, they would get all 29 of Florida's electoral votes.  That's a much bigger chunk of the pie - 5.4%.  Worse yet, in the electoral college getting the votes is a zero-sum game.  (Not so in the earlier case because the votes shouldn't have existed in the first place - so picking up a fraudulent vote for candidate A doesn't mean that candidate B lost a vote.)  Candidate A getting 29 votes means candidate B loses 29 votes, so the real swing is more than 10%.<p>Meaning that in this hypothetical, the electoral college managed to magnify the influence of what was a relatively small instance of electoral fraud by a factor of more than 2,500%, into something that could easily swing an election.",1352305041

No.  The coin coming up heads is stronger evidence in favor my ""model"" (P[heads] = 0.75) than if it had come up tails, but it's pretty far from conclusive.  The logic doesn't change if I tell you that the probability of heads is 90%, 99.9%, or whatever. (but, if I say it's 99.9% and it comes up tails, I'll concede that the model's wrong.  If the prediction is extreme enough, a single observation can invalidate the model).<p>To extend the analogy, we only know if I have a good model for this biased coin if we flip it a bunch of times and roughly 3/4 of the outcomes are heads.  If we can't do that, because the coin flip is a one-off event (stretching the analogy quite a bit, but whatever), we still could tell if I'm good at modeling coin flips: if you give me a bunch of different coins, I give you a probability of heads for each one, and then we see whether the proportion of heads after we flip each one is close to the average of the probabilities I gave (i.e., let B(i) be 1 if the ith coin is heads, 0 if it's tails.  Then n^{-1/2} (B(1) - Prob[coin 1 is heads] + B(2) - Prob[coin 2 is heads] + ... + B(n) - Prob[coin n is heads]) obeys a CLT and -- if the probabilities are right -- it becomes normal with mean zero and known variance as n gets large).<p>If I tell you that each probability is .75 or some other number greater than 0.5 but less than 1, and <i>all the coins always come up heads</i> than I'm not ""nailing it.""

Voters in less populous states are over-represented in the EC, and urban voters are a key Democratic constituency, so you would definitely see messaging shifting away from things that would appeal to farmers in Iowa, since it would cease to matter (think things like mentions of ethanol as an energy source in stump speeches), and towards things that would drive up Latino turnout in Los Angeles: heavier discussion of immigration reform, for example, which very rarely came up in this cycle -- the foreign policy debate didn't mention drug violence in Mexico at all, this time, I don't think, and instead focused entirely on the middle east.<p>I think lots of ""urban"" issues would suddenly be much more relevant to the campaign, particularly on the left; gun control would be back on the table, marijuana legalization would start to be taken seriously as a social justice issue, etc.  I'm partly talking out of my ass, but things would almost definitely change.",1352304303

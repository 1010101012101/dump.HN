But I think he&#x27;s in on the joke and it&#x27;s just a theatrical performance, like Saint IGNUcius.<p>My Emacs Hacker Boss from UniPress Software and I ran into him at a scifi con, and my &quot;Evil Software Hoarder&quot; colleague asked him &quot;I heard a terrible rumor about your house burning down. Is it true?&quot; He fired back without missing a beat, &quot;Yes, but where you work, you probably heard about it in advance.&quot; We all had a laugh and no offense was taken: he&#x27;s got a sharp sense of humor and he&#x27;s quick on his feet!<p>Here he is being a total dick, by chastising someone for posting a baby announcement (who is now 21 years old) to a mailing list about having dinner on the other side of the continent as he was on.

Other than having the career, which could profile him as the likely Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin inventor, the article build up him to be one.<p>I am going to argue against the most convincing statement:\n&quot;It&#x27;s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.&quot;<p>As someone who has engineering background in CS field, he will be aware of the Bitcoin and a peculiar case of having similar name (He is Dorian S Nakamoto). Thus, he will be a bit more interested in it(People with unique name can share that sentiment) and know enough about the Myth of the disappearance of the Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin inventor. We(including him) all know the kind of disturbance we will face if we were identified as mysterious Bitcoin Inventor. There is also a cloud of uncertainty over legality of Bitcoin. I don&#x27;t think the news about Silk Road with Bitcoin and the FBI issue will help either. For him, he has to be more weary since he shares part of the name. So when this privacy invading journalist come knocking on his door, he pull the Bitcoin inventor act saying that he relegate the task to other to shoo her away thinking it will be over. An easy way out, he might have thought. The fact that he cannot disappear like the Bitcoin inventor did not register in his mind at that time.  He could have been pestered by people about Bitcoin before, just like the journalist started asking him about Bitcoin in the middle of model train email exchanges. He is the real Dorian S Nakamoto. He cannot deny his name but he is not a mythical Satoshi Nakamoto. If you were an introvert, how would you react in that situation? You most likely shut up just like he did. Around these assumption the journalist build up the theory that Dorian is the Bitcoin Inventor.<p>Anyway, I am pissed at the NewsWeek on violating the privacy of individuals(Dorian S Nakamoto and Satoshi Nakamoto) who wants to be left alone.",1394153653

Most of the &quot;science&quot; around nutrition would only be acceptable in theoretical physics and paleontology.  We&#x27;re starting to see nutrition studied a little better, but it&#x27;s the past half decade where we seeing actual science around nutrition, and we&#x27;ll need at least a couple hundred years before we can say with certainty what is best for human longevity.  Until then, we&#x27;re guessing.<p>We think cholesterol is bad in excess, and conventional wisdom dictates, that since eggs are high in cholesterol, that eggs should be avoided.  Except, the body doesn&#x27;t metabolize much if any dietary cholesterol, and instead it&#x27;s the cholesterol that you synthesize that&#x27;s dangerous.  There are some interesting observations with high fat dairy, which actually reduces cholesterol instead of increasing it.  Again, conventional wisdom is demonstrating itself to not be correct.  Calories in, calories out sounds good on paper, eat less, and you will lose weight.  But this also is proven incorrect over and over.  I have seen this in studies, and witnessed it first hand with a girl I was living with who was trying to lose weight.  She would eat a fifth of the calories that I would eat, and would gain weight, where I would chow down on meat, fats, and green beans and lose weight.  What does appear to be apparent is it&#x27;s easier to maintain a healthy weight if you never gain weight in the first place; essentially your body attempts to return to it&#x27;s heaviest when calories are available.  Many new studies show that the war on salt is based in bad science, and it may not have as much of an impact as we thought.  So is a little haiku the answer?  I don&#x27;t know what the right answer is, but I know it isn&#x27;t that simple.",1394153245

People often confuse HHVM with HPHPc, also made by Facebook. HPHPc came first; it was a converter that converted all the PHP files in a folder into individual C++ files. In other words, you would end up uploading the C++ files to the server, not PHP files. Facebook abandoned HPHPc early on for multiple reasons (it was actually developed by a single developer as a tool for one-time use to convert all of Facebook&#x27;s existing PHP files into C++, back when Facebook was considering rewriting the website in C++ for improving performance). While the idea for HHVM was loosely based on HPHPc, the approach is much different. HHVM is a standalone replacement for the PHP engine. It has almost 100% support with the native PHP language, up to PHP 5.5, and even (intentionally) reproduces the various bugs in the PHP language, to maintain compatibility. HHVM only replaces PHP, not Apache or anything else in your stack. It is really, really easy to replace it via their FastCGI handler.",1394153124

If someone refuses to leave or keeps coming back, then are of course within your rights to eject them,sue them, get a restraining order against them and so on.<p>But in general, if you don&#x27;t want people to knock on your front door then put up a sign, or a fence, or some other indication that you want to be left alone. you&#x27;d better, because if you allow people to trespass on your land without doing anything about it - say they cross your land to go fish in a river that lies just beyond it - then they may develop a right from your failure to challenge them, sometimes known as adverse possession or an easement by prescription.

Stepping through code in the debugger and looking at its runtime state and control flow is crucial to understanding what&#x27;s really going on.<p>But the problem with reading code (especially code that you&#x27;re not running in the debugger), is that you see what you think it&#x27;s supposed to do, not what it&#x27;s actually doing, especially when you&#x27;re &quot;skimming&quot; over it as I like to do.<p>Occasionally I have the luxury of enough time to go into &quot;study mode&quot; and carefully read over code line by line (I&#x27;ve been reading the amazing npm packages in <a href=""http://voxeljs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voxeljs.com</a> recently, which is some amazing and beautiful JavaScript code that I recommend highly). But that is extremely tedious and exhausting, and uses so much energy and attention and blood sugar that I have to close my eyes and take little power naps to let my mind garbage collect.<p>And then I get these weird dreams where I&#x27;m thinking in terms of the new models and api&#x27;s I&#x27;ve just learned, and sometimes wake up in a cold sweat screaming in the middle of the night. (I have sympathy for Theo and his neighbors he wakes up at night from nightmares about all the terrifying code he reads.) (So far no terrible nightmares about voxeljs, but a few claustrophobic underground minecraft flashbacks.)<p>Refactoring or rewriting or translating code to another language is a great way to force yourself to really understand some code. I&#x27;ve found some terrible bugs in my own code that way, that I totally overlooked before. And looking back, the reason the bugs were there was that I just saw what I intended to have written, instead of what I actually wrote.<p>And for those kinds of bugs, comments that describe the programmer&#x27;s intent are actually very dangerous and misleading if they&#x27;re not totally up to date and valid. Because the compiler does not check comments for errors!<p>I try to use lots of intermediate descriptive variable names (instead of complex nested expressions), lots of asserts and debug logs, and do things in small easy to understand and validate steps that you can single step through with the debugger. It&#x27;s important to examine the runtime state of the program as well as the static source code. But that is hellishly hard to do with networking code in the kernel.<p>I also like to get away from the distractions of the keyboard and debugger, and slog my way through every line of the code, by printing it out on paper, going outside, sitting in the sun under a tree, and reading through every page one by one front to back, scribbling notes on the paper with a magic marker. That forces me to make my way all the way through the code before making any false assumptions, jumping around, and getting distracted. (ADHD Management Techniques 101!)",1394150455
7357440,comment,7353763,7353763,3,0,ggchappell,,,"Ignoring Python for a bit and thinking as a designer of some hypothetical future language: there is a nice rule given here for evaluation in a Boolean context. I wonder whether it should be taken as a general guideline for future languages.<p>The rule, in its entirety, is this:<p>- Booleans are falsy when false.<p>- Numbers are falsy when zero.<p>- Containers are falsy when empty.<p>- None is always falsy.<p>- No other type of value is ever falsy.<p>I can think of two ways we might possibly want to alter the rule.<p>The first is to expand the idea of <i>number</i> to include arbitrary groups (or monoids?), with the identity element being falsy. So, for example, a matrix with all entries zero might be falsy. Or a 3-D transformation might be falsy if it does not move anything.<p>The second is one I have encountered in C++. There, an I/O stream is falsy if it is in an error state. This makes error checking easy; there is one less member-function name to remember. We might expand this idea to include things like Python&#x27;s urllib, or any object that wraps a connection or stream of some kind.<p>EDIT: OTOH, there is the Haskell philosophy, where the only thing that can be evaluated in a Boolean context is a Bool, so the only falsy thing is <i>False</i>.<p>EDIT 2: The comment by clarkevans (quoting a message from INADA Naoki) already partially addressed the above group idea: &quot;I feel zero value of non abelian group should not mean False in bool context.&quot;",1394150404

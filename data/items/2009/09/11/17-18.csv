817762,comment,817096,817612,0,0,neilk,,,"When I was there (2005-2006, so, ancient history maybe), Google had a cultural problem with languages like Javascript. All their coding standards were developed for languages like C++ and Java and the typical Google engineer had the most experience in such languages. Projects that promised to relieve the programmer from having to write in nasty Javascript (such as GWT) had a lot of support. There are islands of Javascripters in Google, but many of them are working on the browser initiatives.<p>That said, the article is right about the importance of peer review at Google, although the headline is typical journalistic bait. Google's culture isn't so much engineering as it is science. Business is understood as an ongoing experiment. Opinions are worthless, only data counts.<p>The results are stunning and many cowboy developers have become converts. There are many parts of Google's codebase that are so beautiful they almost brought tears to my eyes. You don't know what it's like to see megabyte after megabyte of source code scroll by, and <i>you can't tell who wrote it</i>. The same conventions are used everywhere, ""tricky"" parts are at an absolute minimum, and good documentation is usually a given.<p>If there's one thing about Google culture that is worth preserving in all the startups now budding off, it's the peer review.",1252691523

E.g. for baby monitors in the US, the market size must be less than the total revenue of all the companies that make them, and the units sold per annum must be less than the number of babies born per year in the US. You then may find one company that claims to have shipped over a million baby monitors in a year (e.g. inside their SEC filings or even marketing material), which is therefore a lower bound.<p>A combination of google, asking people (e.g. either industry experts or in your local shop ask the shop assistant roughly how many of those do they sell a day) and you should be able to get to an order of magnitude of an established market place.",1252691108

If they want to make sure end users are getting apps that actually work properly after future OS updates they should reject apps that use these private APIs. I respect that developers and freedom and whatnot  but as an end user I don't want to be stuck with some perpetually broken unusable mess after every OS update to facilitate it. (see Linux on the desktop as a good example of why this isn't end user friendly. apt-get dist-upgrade -- opps no more 3D acceleration, vmware doesn't work, can't even build from source because libblahblah is something something blah libtool make -o something or another)",1252689317

Palm will have private APIs and privilege its own developers first. Consider the internal app team the alpha API users. This isn't a bad thing! As a customer, I'm more than willing to let the internal developers and people willing to hack into the internal APIs to find the problems with the API first, so that something sub-optimal doesn't become set in stone too early.<p>Public APIs have a way of sticking around, and I like to see companies get it right.

I suppose if I wanted to I could apply to a seed-fund, although candidly speaking taking other people's money is not something I see doing in my future unless it is in return for providing them goods or services.<p>My suggestion for you and any other person who wants to work on nights and weekends: above all else, <i>ship something fast</i>.  Most people throw in the towel because they can't get into the positive feedback loop, it seems like it will take forever until they can get there, then ork gets busy and the baby gets sick and...  and then they've forgotten about it.<p>Nothing replaces paying customers for giving ongoing motivation, feedback as to how to make your application better (via asking directly and reading the data about how they actually use it), and giving money to fund buying the things that you can't produce yourself (like, in your case, managed hosting).<p>Incidentally: although I'm definitely on the quick side of the bell curve, I took money for a product which was written (including the website to sell it and everything) in eight days.  There is nothing wrong with taking six months to write something, but if you could have broken that into Phase 1: 1 month and Phase 2: 5 months you'd have money coming in, a website collecting links, customers giving suggestions, and MUCH less risk of building something no one wanted.",1252688458

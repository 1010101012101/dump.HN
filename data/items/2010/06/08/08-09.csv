DPI is looking at what you got; PPI is looking at what you wanted. LPI, then, is looking at what you can do, and each is measuring a different technological solution to ""image"".<p>PPI is taking a digital image and saying ""I want it yay big"", LPI is saying ""I'll do it by drawing at least this many differently sized dots of entirely different colors"", and DPI is going ""This is how many dots I'm counting you did it with"".<p>edit: Apparently, some manufacturers of small LED displays like to report DPI as the number of LEDs per inch - that is, 3x the native resolution for images.

Wireless tethering via SmartPhone is a new feature for people so the demand is pretty low right now. It's not clear that it's the ideal way to deliver tethering due to the battery overhead. If you start with 5-6 hours of continuos 3G usage adding wireless tethering is going to bring you down to the <4 hour mark. That badly breaks the sunrise-to-sunset usage most people demand.

1413330,comment,1412650,1412962,0,0,zasz,,,"No, I don't think feminism implies that feminists have to show women are the same as men in every way. It's perfectly feminist to say that women deserve to be judged as individuals on their own merits, as men are. I'm sure there's no feminist who would disagree that women are physically weaker, but they don't need to concoct studies asserting that women are physically equal to men just so they can advocate for suffrage and property rights.<p>My understanding that the claim women are totally equal to men is that they are equal in some moral sense, which should be disconnected from natural ability anyway.<p>I suppose if women were empirically shown to be twenty times dumber than men, and that women capable of learning to read and write were as rare as Einstein, then feminism really has no case to stand on and women's suffrage would be ludicrous, but the average woman is as smart as the average man, and that's sufficient to give men and women equal moral standing. So I don't see why feminism would fall over if it was shown that fewer women were ever going to win a Fields Medal. Unusual cases like that don't matter much for day to day morality.",1275986013

You'll find plenty of Apple pundits like Gruber who'll dispute this due to Apple getting behind H.264 for web video, but Apple themselves (and standards bodies like MPEG or W3C) don't use the term incorrectly. Apple have sailed pretty close to the wind though, using phrasing like ""open and standard technologies"" and then including technologies that are standard, but not open standards.<p>I thought I caught them referring to something that wasn't as an ""Open Standard"" in the keynote but I've not had time to check, but certainly they've been very careful not to previously. (I think the phrasing might have been ""open industry standard"").<p>But in, for example, Thoughts on Flash, the phrase ""open standard"" is used repeatedly to refer to HTML5, CSS, Javascript etc. and portrayed as a very good quality for these things to have but when H.264 is mentioned it is referred to just as an ""industry standard"".<p><a href=""http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/</a><p>Also Skype, along with Broadcom and Xiph, are working on a royalty-free voice codec at IETF and have offered their codecs and patents as the basis for that work.

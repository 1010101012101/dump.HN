They respect the strong and the committed, they deride the weak and conflicted.<p>This is a human war, and the only thing accomplished by flying drones around is a further separation from the people subject to their actions from the values of the people flying them.<p>All everyone ever really wants is to have a better life for themselves and their family.

In basically any use of the word ""physics"" for <i>organizations</i> (like ""physics departments"", ""Nobel prize in physics"", the ""American Physical Society""), ""physics"" is a discipline which is much broader than simply the search for new fundamental physical laws.  It basically includes any field that uses the <i>training and techniques</i> useful for searching for new fundamental physical laws.  For example: condensed matter, optics, astronomy, astrophysics, quantum computing.  That is, physics organizations (like most academic organizations) are united by a common set of training and techniques, not a common objective.  This is just a fact about the useful way to organize human beings.<p>But, if you are defining ""physics"" to mean ""fundamental physics""---i.e. new laws of nature--then...<p>(1) There hasn't been a <i>confirmed</i> theoretical physics discovery since 1967 when the Higgs mechanisms completed the Standard Model (although some might argue that the profoundly new understanding of existing fundamental physical law provided by asymptotic freedom, in 1973, qualifies as fundamental physics even if no fundamental laws were discovered per se).<p>(2) There hasn't been a non-trivial (in the sense of being both not-easily-predicted by theory, like the top quark, and not trivially incorporated into existing theory, like neutrino masses) discovery in experimental physics since 1973-4, when the electroweak and strong theories were more or less confirmed.  (It doesn't qualify as ""easily predicted"" since there were serious doubts beforehand.)<p>There are possible exceptions to (2), depending on which experiments you consider to be most important for dark energy, dark matter, and cosmology/CMB.  There haven't really been any <i>decisive</i> experiments---only a steady accumulation of evidence.  I wouldn't consider any theory related to these three as confirmed.<p>So yes, the field of fundamental physics is profoundly stagnant.<p>(This is just the best historical understanding of a myself, a grad student, so I could be wrong or disagreed with by more prestigious physicists.

I posted a fairly well received comment on dressing well previously: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1136454"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1136454</a>. I've reproduced the comment below with some minor modifications. Happy to answer questions. :) Of course, my views are opinion not fact. But they've worked well in practice.<p>--<p>One reason technical people don't dress well is because they never learned how. Another reason is that techies are unconventional and don't place a high priority on mainstream standards. That being said, I've been fashion hacking for half a year now and the results have been great. Here's some concrete advice based on my experience. Note that I'm 21; people who have been professionals for 15 years and have kids probably dress differently. I'm also average height and average weight, so you'll have to make adjustments if you are tall/short/whatever.<p>Tshirts. Fitted solid color shirt with jeans that fit and shoes that impress = coffee shop, homework at the library, class. Easy as pie, and if you get the fit right and are in decent shape you look good.<p>Casual collared shirts. For general wear get bright, solid color fitted ones. Bar, restaurant, class, whatever. It's a very flexible look because you can switch in/out jeans and slacks. Express's 1MX shirts are a solid choice (<a href=""http://www.express.com/1mx-modern-fit-stretch-cotton-shirt-19924-49.pro?Mcat=49&Mcatp=cat_1&Mpos=0&Mppg=0&Mcatn=Shirts&Mcatpn=category&Mpg=SEARCH%2BNAV&Mpper=3&user_att_name=Interest&user_att_value=Email&Mrsaa=*&Mrsavf=*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.express.com/1mx-modern-fit-stretch-cotton-shirt-1...</a>) and very popular for this type of role.<p>Collared shirts for your suit. Go to a tailor. Get measured. Go to a store that sells suites like Men's Warehouse. Get two white shirts, a powder blue shirt, and a light gray shirt and you are done. Don't complicate things with stripes or harder colors if you are just starting. If you want to add personality to your shirt you can do it with a tie You're going for these kinds of looks: <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dM4F-K2W4sA/SmnPxKOASGI/AAAAAAAAAoU/DNmbyi-Wmjg/s320/John+Stewart.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dM4F-K2W4sA/SmnPxKOASGI/AAAAAAAAAo...</a>, <a href=""http://0.tqn.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/P/k/BrianKersey-Pool.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0.tqn.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/P/k/BrianKersey-Pool.jpg</a>.\nHoodies. Buy two solid color ones, one navy and one grey. No branding, no weird details, no nothing. Solid color only. You can't really improve your look with hoodies, but you can really mess it up by buying one that isn't a solid color. Example (from JCrew): <a href=""http://images.jcrew.com/erez4/cache/images_eiec_25_25050_25050_BL8679_tif_4e380acfa84017f0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.jcrew.com/erez4/cache/images_eiec_25_25050_250...</a>.<p>Graphic Tees. These are hard. You have to be younger to pull off a graphic tee and even then the single to noise ratio in terms of nice/ugly graphic tees is really high. You're probably better off avoiding them<p>Polos. it's very tough to find ones that fit well. I've had decent success with the custom fit from Raulph Lauren (<a href=""http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2592875"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=25928...</a>). But please, don't buy a polo with a huge logo on the front. Examples: This one from Raulph Lauren (<a href=""http://stores.gameentertainment.org/catalog/Ralph_Lauren_men_Polo_P39151_thumb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stores.gameentertainment.org/catalog/Ralph_Lauren_men...</a>) and this one from Express (<a href=""http://www.aldikkan.com/online/published/publicdata/ALDIKKANDDB/attachments/SC/products_pictures/Picture%202_enl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aldikkan.com/online/published/publicdata/ALDIKKAN...</a>) are both BAD choices. A big logo just doesn't look good, and it makes it seem like you are brand dropping.\nSomething for parties. Something that's a little different. Do not buy this until you are ready. Go with your graphic tee or a regular collared shirt until you are confident enough to pick something cool. Example (from Express): <a href=""http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/expressfashion/20_552_5196_870?$ensembleproduct$"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/expressfashion/20_552_5196_8...</a>.<p>Jeans. Don't get designer jeans. Don't get them torn. Don't get them baggy. Regular or slim fit only. Get them in colors ranging from dark blue to blue/gray. Do not get light blue. Do not get jeans that are too long. They should never, never touch the ground and they should cover 1/4 to 1/2 of your shoe laces when you are standing.<p>Casual Shoes. Women notice shoes. Seriously. It's really interesting how much they look at your shoes. You can have everything else right, but if your shoes are big blocky white gym shoes, you have failed. I say this as someone who bought big blocky white gym shoes from freshman year in high school to sophomore year in college. The good news is that you can crowd source style selection by looking at Zappos's most popular (<a href=""http://www.zappos.com/search/shoes/filter/productTypeFacet/%22Shoes%22/gender/%22Mens%22/subCategoryFacet/%22Sneakers+and+Athletic+Shoes%22/hide:categoryFacet/%22Shoes%22/personalityFacet/%22Casual%22/sort/productPopularity/asc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zappos.com/search/shoes/filter/productTypeFacet/%...</a>). Once you have the style selection, just make sure you get a decent color. I own a pair of these (<a href=""http://www.zappos.com/multiview/126799/14074"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zappos.com/multiview/126799/14074</a>).<p>Boots. Get something that looks good but does what it is supposed to do (stand up to the elements). I've had a good experience with Red Wing. The company used to make the shoes for the US Army during WWI and WWII, so they make a quality, durable product. I own a pair of these (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Red-Wing-Shoes-Gentleman-Traveler/dp/B..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Red-Wing-Shoes-Gentleman-Traveler/dp/B...</a>) and they are awesome (but really expensive :-/ ). I've used them constantly in the snow and hold up great, plus they look good too.<p>Coat. You should get a wool pea coat. You should stop wearing your Northface that is the size of a small tent. Example (from J Crew): <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rTdnjj_0uYM/StUedrqnCGI/AAAAAAAAAkY/Bl5KPSI9bfU/s320/Blog.Fashion.Focus.Mens.Peacoat.J.Crew.Authentic.Peacoat.with.Thinsulate.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_rTdnjj_0uYM/StUedrqnCGI/AAAAAAAAAk...</a>. Peat coats are a proven style that have been around forever. A nice coat is a really expensive investment and you don't want to buy one that will look bad when your style changes as you get older.\nSunglasses. Authentic aviators that have frames that fit your face. Done. Like the pea coat, aviators have been around for a long time and there are only a few people who truly don't look good in them.<p>Also, a few general tips:<p>Fit is the key to everything. It doesn't matter how much you spend on clothing or how well you match your colors. You will not look good if your clothes don't fit. Period. Everything you get should be slim fitting. Odds are 10 to 1 that the jeans you are wearing right now are far too baggy. Loose clothing was one of my most difficult habits to break.<p>Do not accept anything less than exactly what you want. Settling for clothing is the worst thing you can do. The legs on the pants you just bought half an inch too long? Return them. The collar of the shirt a little too tight? Return it. There are billions of styles and billions of fits out there. Taking a shortcut to save some time is not the road to success. You have to keep searching until you find a fit and a brand that you really, really like.<p>Focus first on making choices that don't look bad. It's actually really difficult to develop this skill. Once you can consistently make choices that aren't bad, you can start being more risky and shoot for things that look good.<p>One more thing. The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. Wearing nice clothes is something you do, but it's not something you brag about. Your clothes and brands don't define you and they don't change who you are. The only things clothes do is get in the way (if they are bad) or complement what you already have (if they are good). It's like being rude or polite in a conversation; it doesn't change the content of the conversation, but things can be really ugly or really pleasant depending on the choices you make.",1286298831

Its the McDonalds end of recruiting.<p>On the other hand, there is a small (as mentioned above) 1-2% of recruiters who work in really high paying sectors that really know their industries.

1760499,comment,1759874,1760319,0,0,minouye,,,"Some anecdotal evidence, about Groupon's inability to make these deals ""work"" for merchants:<p>This Saturday I went skydiving, and used a Groupon I purchased last month.  The skydiving school had nothing but bad things to say about Groupon. According to the school, they were told that they would sell somewhere in the neighborhood of 200-300 skydives--they ending up selling closer to 1200.  Now the fact that the number of Groupons wasn't capped at something more reasonable was most likely an oversight on the part of the merchant.  However, Groupon's sales staff should have at the very least alerted the merchant to the potential risk.  In this situation, it seems that Groupon was attempting to extract all possible value from merchant--Groupon had to have had some inkling that the deal was not going to be mutually beneficial.<p>Can you extrapolate this to all merchants using Groupon?  No, but the study results certainly didn't surprise me.",1286298318

It can be valuable, but only if you're learning the <i>underlying concepts</i> and not just learning the keystrokes to do something.<p>We need to teach folks that (a) computers aren't magic, (b) there's a logical approach to solving problems and it happens to be called programming, and (c) programming can be fun.<p>[EDIT: Fixed formatting.]",1286298224

The bank already got fined for lax controls by the regulator--a civil matter, but they were not left unpunished. The trader will never pay restitution, cannot be jailed for that, and everybody including the court knew that.<p>People always waste energy wanting to demonize or glorify when they should analyze. It is not hard for me to believe that bank managers could be clueless rather that criminal. Let's hear one suggestion that will prevent such cases in the future.<p>This case strikes me as similar to the Joe Jett/Kidder Peabody case a few years earlier. Self-deluded trader, weak accounting system, lax controls, clueless manager. Result: A big loss that destroyed the bank. Banks have far more privacy in their financial life than individuals.

He called my cell phone and my typical response is to not answer calls that are not pre-defined contacts at work.  The guy then went to my LinkedIn profile, found my company, went to the company website, and then called my office.  I gave him an earful about how unprofessional I thought it was for him to be contacting me at my job to recruit for another position and then hung up on him when he tried to backpedal saying he was just looking for referrals.  In my experience, recruiters are not only clueless but also rude and shady.<p>I have personally known a wonderful recruiter and despite my respect for her, I have very little respect for the average recruiter.  The profession itself does provide value as it is truly difficult to find good people, but the low signal to noise among recruiters themselves can just as easily make it more difficult to find the right person.",1286298216

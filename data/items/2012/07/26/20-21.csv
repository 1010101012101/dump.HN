During the summer, we noticed the monitors developing a weird wavy waterline-ish streak along the top 2"" of the LCD. The LCD still displayed fine, but everything above this waterline was noticeably darker. The wavy waterline was different on each monitor - on some it only extended down a centimeter across one corner.<p>Eventually half of the monitors in these 3 labs developed this strange mark. We RMA'd in batches; eventually we learned the glue holding the LCD layers together was failing. The older (and newer) Dell LCDs didn't have that issue.</i><p>That's the kind of thing I'd worry about here, especially since there's likely no recourse. Will these LCDs have strange issues, like a watermark caused by the failure of cheap glue?",1343336234

4298685,comment,4296322,4298509,10,0,lotharbot,,,"I guess the question is whether we're talking about B-H the textile company, or whether we're talking about Buffett's holdings in general.<p>Buffett didn't have anything to do with the textile company when it was Zynga's age (5 years); B-H merged in 1955 and Buffett didn't start buying until 1962.  He's actually called buying it his biggest investment mistake, as he chose not to sell the textile company over a perceived slight, but probably could have made a lot more with the money if he'd invested it in better industries.<p>As for the holding company, Buffett started BPL in 1956, had several partnerships running by 1960, and merged them in 1962; at that point (a similar age to Zynga) the holdings were already quite diverse, just not under the B-H name.  It wasn't until the late 1960s that he started using B-H as his general holding company.<p>So, if we're going to hold up Buffett as an ""old-school CEO"" who doesn't sell shares of his own company, let's remember that he's called not selling B-H (textiles) his biggest investment mistake, and let's remember that it's different to hold on to stock in a diversified holdings company (whether it was called BPL or B-H at the time) than it is to hold on to stock in a single-purpose company.",1343336216

There's also some leeway into other kinds of movement so latency jitter and a few dropped packets do not inadvertently disrupt the player's flow. Furthermore, the server does latency compensation that is crucial for actually hitting anything, especially with hitscan weapons lacking AoE damage. All the above is a very simplified explanation of what happens, more details at following PDF [1].<p>Games on OnLive lack the above features and you also have input lag, where, for example, a camera movement with the mouse will take the full network RTT plus processing time to reflect on the client's screen.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/courses/4513-B03/papers/games/bernier.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/courses/4513-B03/papers/game...</a>",1343336098

4298667,comment,4298100,4298100,25,0,wcchandler,,,"I attempted something similar during my last year of college.  I made a posting at my closest large city, detailing my ideal job.  I also laid out what seemed to be good requirements that I would have satisfied for the position.<p>I was astounded by the results.  I quickly had to remove the ad, too.  The messages were heart wrenching to read.  One man was unemployed after being discharged from the military.  Another man had been doing senior level work for 10 years.  Another didn't have an ounce of experience in this field.  And finally a couple were recent graduates -- these were the only ones I was interested in.  I left mine up for a couple days.  I realized the deceitfulness of this experiment.  I genuinely felt remorse despite my animalistic nature to size up the competition.  Then I reflected on myself and thought about the few times I'd read a job post and quickly turn to my wife ""This one sounds perfect!  I really hope I get it!"" and be grinning from ear to ear for the next half an hour only to be hit with sadness for a day or two.  Then I wondered, if it was this easy for me, who is to say others wouldn't be doing the same?<p>I changed my rules for applying to job posts after that.  They had to actually state their recruiting firm in the post.  Bonus points for disclosing their client.  They also had to post an email or website -- some way to validate the poster.  Again, bonus points for phone numbers.  I would also search various strings in the post to see if they're listed anywhere else.  I became a lot more cautious in my search, which was a good thing as I wasn't slapping my name, email, address and phone number all over to who knows where.<p>After my experiment I reached a conclusion-- I had broad competition and shouldn't try to gauge myself on others.  This made me much calmer in the interviews. I felt reassured knowing it wasn't ""what I knew"", and instead ""who I was.""  I decided to be more of myself and not give canned answers that I thought they wanted to hear.  My skillset was expendable and I needed to realize that.  I lost my sense of entitlement.  I used to think my $100,000 piece of paper meant something.<p>Then I realized it did.",1343336064

This also allows you to get an idea of the personality of the person you may be working for.<p>After a while, I'll put the question out there, ""Hey I saw that you posted Foo job at your company. Has this position been filled? I'm extremely interested.""<p>If they don't have Twitter, I'll engage them straight through LinkedIn. At this point I'll be straight upfront and honest. Just tell them that you are interested in finding out more information about the company before you formally apply for the job. When the time comes, try and get your resume straight to their personal email via this conversation.<p>Open up a line of dialog with someone who is posted the job. If it's an HR department, it may be tough, but not impossible. It's worth it in the long run to build up connections (even if their virtual) with people. Blindly applying to positions is just going to leave you in the dark.<p>EDIT: Grammar",1343335791

I see J2EE (whatever that means to some people, that's a lot of technologies in there), Hibernate, JUnit, HTML/CSS/JQuery.</i><p>Given that Java is one of your stronger areas, and given how much demand there is for Java developers, I'd suggest you continue to focus on Java and related technologies.  In that area, you'd probably be well served to learn  Spring (the core DI framework), Spring MVC, and Spring Data / JPA... make sure you have a decent knowledge of SQL (you don't need to be a DBA, but some low level SQL never hurts).  Knowing the ""raw"" Hibernate API won't hurt, but JPA is really where it's at these days.<p>String knowledge of the core Java language is always good as well.  Java is a pretty big language/library, but get to know the Collections APIs, the IO APIs, at least a basic understanding of threads / threading (including the java.util.concurrent package), and maybe some basic knowledge around using sockets in Java.<p>If you have (or can claim) that knowledge, you're in decent shape for a lot of Java oriented positions.  Beyond that, knowing the low-level servlet API is still valuable, as well as some of the more popular 3rd party libraries... get to know Quartz, Lucene, Apache Camel, etc.<p>Learning basic administration skills around at least one Java application server (JBoss, GlassFish, Geronimo, whatever) is always good.<p>Learn as much as you can about Tomcat.<p>Knowing how to build web-services (both old style SOAP and RESTful services) is good.  Look at JAX-RS and Apache Axis.<p>Get a handle on all of the previously mentioned tech, and you'd be pretty in demand in the Java world (unless you live somewhere really desolate, where there just isn't any demand for tech jobs!).<p>If you want to move onto some of the new'ish stuff that's catching on and becoming ""in demand"" I'd say spend some time learning Hadoop / HBase, Storm, S4, Kafka and maybe another NoSQL database like MongoDB.<p><i>Would a J2EE certification help? It might not make a difference to the startup guys here on HN, but would Java experience, no J2EE experience but J2EE certifications get me in the door somewhere?</i><p>This is always a controversial question, but my take is that ""yes, certifications do help."" The question is ""how much do they help?"" and ""where do they help?""  At a startup, maybe not so much... at your typical Fortune 500 $BIGCORP, they probably do help.  A certification alone isn't going to get you a job if you have NO skill, but if you're competing with somebody else for 1 position, and you both have roughly the same background, and you have certification and the other guy doesn't, it might just tip the scales in your favor.  BUT... if you pursue any certifications, do it right... USE the experience as an excuse to do a ""deep dive"" into whatever, and actually LEARN.  Don't just download ""brain dumps"" and cram for the test.  Studying for a certification test can be very useful, I learned a lot studying to get my SCJP back in the day.  Doing the certification was it's own reward, even if the actual cert never helped me land a job.",1343335245

And it is difficult for a lot of people to grapple with the idea that such seemingly fundamentally, some would say, evil devices can be used for good.<p>The comparison with cars is a good one though. Cars are an example of how lethal power exists in the hands of many in society. And that's true to an enormous degree, not just with cars though they are a prime example. Most people have the ability to take the lives of others without a great deal of effort. Imagine what would happen if, say, 1ppm of humanity woke up and decided to do murder that day. There would be a lot of killings. And yet society is still largely peaceful. Because most people can be trusted with the lives of their fellow humans. And it's important to realize how deeply we take that for granted. Something as simple as riding a bus or driving in traffic represents a tremendous trust in our fellow citizens to not murder us, and they trust us not to murder them as well.<p>Firearms do not represent injecting a unique capability for death and injury into society, they're just make that aspect of daily life more blatantly obvious. But just as with cars, knives, fists, pencils, hammers, bricks, fire, and all that most people can be trusted with firearms most of the time. And indeed when firearms are allowed into the hands of citizens of good intent they can be used to thwart crimes quite often. Many rapes and roberies have been stopped by firearms, often just by the mere presence of a firearm (not even counting the deterrent effects). And in some spectacular cases firearms have been used defensively to stop mass murders in their tracks. But these examples tend to be less dramatic than successful mass shootings, so they tend to be less well known.<p>On the whole, the point still stands, it is safer for the average person to own a gun than to own a car. And that is a testament to the trustworthiness of the average citizen, and the degree to which many people take gun ownership seriously and solemnly.",1343334405

4298432,comment,4296956,4298298,11,0,koko775,,,"EDIT: This is meant to be educational, not a rant. I'm hoping people take it that way.<p>Maven requires a standard directory layout. Maven chose that hierarchy, because:<p>1) Namespacing. With tens or hundreds of thousands of packages out there, there needs to be an unambiguous way to refer to them separately.<p>2) Multiple language support. Maven can do Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, and so on - in the same project, even. It can even do Javascript, which isn't a JVM language, in certain cases. For the JVM languages, if you want a multi-lamguage project, there has to be an easy way to interoperate (this is enabled by namespacing).<p>3) Separation of test code and program code. Don't ship tests with your binary package.<p>4) Separation of code from data.<p>5) Automation - of packaging, IDE support, etc. This has to do with all of the previous ones. You want to produce a JAR, but don't want to include the default log configuration. So you package the project up. It just happens. You want to edit the code in your IDE. So you add the project. All libraries are downloaded and on your classpath. Add a few lines to your config (as a per-system-user setting or per-project setting, take your pick). Java documentation and source code for those libraries is automatically downloaded. Eclipse hooks it up for you.<p>Suddenly, this:<p>src/main/java<p>src/main/scala<p>src/main/resources<p>src/test/java<p>src/test/scala<p>src/test/resources<p>...makes a lot more sense. It's hardly overengineering, but even then, the engineer isn't the one engineering the build system; these are details Maven takes care of.<p>[Aside: I am appalled and flabbergasted by the ignorance typically leveled at Java by people who don't understand it. It has real flaws, don't get me wrong, but making dependency resolution and installation ridiculously straightforward, multi-language builds dead simple, and unit testing a core feature - <i>these are good things</i>.]<p>Take a look at ant and compare it to maven and you'll see which one makes your life easier.<p> I have worn many hats, and have experience with Python, Ruby, PHP, C, Java, and a little bit of Scala in real world contexts, among others. So I'm not a noob who hasn't experienced elegance or conciseness or performance. Java is actually an amazing language that many people don't give it credit for. Though the syntax <i>can</i> be pretty ugly even when the code is conceptually solid.<p> Losing a bit of nuance here - ant gives you configuration. maven gives you convention. Ant is good for <i>very</i> custom; maven is good for straightforward processes.",1343334047

May 2013) is in Statistics.<p>I've loved the field of human persuasion for years, and I think I can add something that I have written in the past to this conversation. I essentially made a list of marketing ""truths"", based on my research and experience, and have tested it against others. What remains of the list is what no one has been able to refute, so I think it's decently close to a list of universal irrefutable ""rules of marketing.""<p>The Truths of Marketing<p>1) Ethos (your perceived character) is the most important.<p>2) People make judgments by comparison/anchoring.<p>3) People process information best from stories.<p>4) People are foremost interested in things that affect them.<p>5) Breaking patterns gets attention.<p>6) People look to other people's decisions when making decisions.<p>7) People will believe things more easily that fit their pre-existent mindset. The converse is also true.<p>8) People handle one idea at a time best.<p>9) People want more choices, but are happier with fewer.<p>10) People decide first, then rationalize - If people are stuck with something, they will like it more over time.<p>11) Experience is memory, the last part of the experience is weighted heavily.<p>* Keep in mind that this should not necessarily be used a checklist; see what the director of a large creative agency says on the subject:<p>""I think that in broad strokes these truisms are accurate, but they aren't really how I personally get to the bottom of the marketing equation when working on a brand.<p>Of them, I think 1 and 4 are probably the closest, but I think the biggest problem is the same problem you find in how any analysis of consumers, or what is usually called ""consumer behavior"" is used -- it is, by definition, one step removed from what you're trying to analyze, yet it's treated like the consumers themselves.<p>Because consumers are often perceived as black boxes to marketers, there's a temptation to analyze their behavior and then market to that analysis instead of to them. Maybe this is because I'm on the creative side, but for me the most useful role of research is to inform and guide what is a form of for our consumer. To not just analyze what drives them, but to genuinely it yourself.<p>Reading research about twelve-year-old girls' purchase decisions and focus group transcripts is not the same thing as thinking like one. I have a client in that market, and I read everything when I'm working on something -- research, web sites, fan magazines, television -- but none of it is a substitute for sitting in a dark room and genuinely trying to imagine the trials of what it must be like to actually be a twelve-year-old girl from a first person perspective.<p>It sounds absurd, but that's how you come up with great ideas -- to do your best to become a twelve-year-old girl, and then develop things that you would enjoy.<p>So I think truisms like yours are useful as long as they remain a means to an end, and not, as they so often do, a checklist, or worse, the end itself.""",1343333918

4298415,comment,4297568,4298063,20,0,lusr,,,"> Probably the most famous of these was the IBM-originated quad-HD 3840 x 2160 22 inch panel. Memory fails but I'll say that this panel goes back at least fifteen years. OEM cost started out around $20K and dropped to about $6K with time.<p>3840x2400.  I paid the equivalent of 1800 USD to buy, insure and import two IBM T221s in very good condition into South Africa about a year ago.  They're pretty interesting displays and quite complex to get up and running optimally even on modern hardware.<p>My buddy imported 3 others along with mine.  All 5 displays have a strange blue glow exactly in the centre of the screen when the screen is displaying pure black.  It's completely unnoticeable except when you know what to look for.  One of the displays needs a 60mm fan replaced -- each monitor comes with two such fans, and the display is rated at 150W power consumption.  Seems to keep the room quite warm :)<p>If you want to run just <i>one</i> at 3840x2400 @ 48Hz you have to spend extra for another set of cables and have a graphics card with 4 DVI ports (good luck with that), or order some of the newer specialist cables that allow you to get away with a pair of dual-link DVI ports.  Your graphics card needs to support a Single Large Surface mode to present the virtual panels (4x1920x1200 or 3x1280x2400) as a single high resolution panel (3840x2400).<p>Furthermore, if you're working with animations (video, games), whichever graphics card you get needs to support frame lock across the display ports otherwise you will experience tearing across the virtual panels.  I believe NVIDIA only supports this in their higher end workstation graphics cards, or across multiple cards in SLI.  For this reason I went with ATI's Eyefinity on a Radeon 6750/6770.<p>Working with photos from my DSLR at full resolution on these two monitors is well worth it though :) (That being said, Windows application support for high DPI is unfortunately a bit pathetic.)",1343333900

Over the past few years I've taken an interest in functional programming and machine learning, lately doing some programming in Clojure and looking at Scala. I've been ""keeping current"" with these technologies, but none of that is J2EE, Hibernate, JUnit, JQuery. We all love to hate Larry Ellison but I'm starting to think he was right when he said that the computer industry is more fashion-driven than women's fashion.<p>I will be creating something, but right now I feel like I have to do something that uses the fashion instead of something I love. A project motivated by fear instead of love? I cringed while I typed that, but there will come a time when the savings runs out and the family will still need to be fed.",1343332967

The question is simply whether or not we've reduced the risk enough that society finds the current level more acceptable than the marginal costs of attempting to reduce it even further. The car argument is saying that the risk of guns is already so much lower than cars that it seems unreasonable to think the former is still at an unacceptable level, but not the latter.",1343332953

The most effective way to use a gun is simply to deter crime.<p>You wouldn't say that the reason the United States and the Soviet Union stockpiled nuclear weapons was because they wanted to level each others' cities. It was simply deterrence.",1343332941

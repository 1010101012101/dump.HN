233849,comment,232622,233839,0,0,Tichy,,,"Not sure, many of the tasks never really seem to come up. When I used emacs, I used the macro recording facility a lot, for example to change larger chunks of code.<p>Eventually I had to switch to Eclipse, and didn't really need the Macros anymore, because of the refactoring functionality that comes with Eclipse. For example, in Emacs I used a macro to quickly generate getters and setters for my class variables (Java - I know...). Eclipse has a Source->Generate Getters and Setters Menu item, so I don't need to fumble around with Macros anymore.<p>Not saying that Eclipse is better, but I simply don't seem to be the kind of person who can remember 100 key combinations. I couldn't for emacs, either, even though sometimes I tried to learn new Emacs tricks.<p>I didn't learn that many keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse, either, even though I keep telling myself that I should. But I can only remember the most important ones, and I learn them because the menu items display a keyboard shortcut.<p>By the way, I seem to remember a quote by some Apple employee who said that in experiments using the GUI was actually faster than keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcut people thought they were faster, but they weren't. Not sure if it is true - hard to believe, but still.",1214977617

If you have severely invested into some really <i>boneheaded</i> design choices, the best way out might actually be to spawn a sub-company, have it create a ""lightweight competitor"" to your own product (designing it the correct way) and then merge the company back in, throwing away your product and using its.<p>Thinking about it, I'm surprised Microsoft doesn't do this.",1214976545

233837,comment,232622,232791,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I started off using Xemacs during my undergrad, but I never really learned how to use it efficiently. When I later returned to Unix, I picked up vim and started using it for everything. When I later returned to emacs, even having learned some keybindings (thanks to GNU readline in gnome-terminal), I just felt handcuffed in my movement abilities.<p>The thing that makes vim great is the many (confusing for initial users, perhaps) different ways of moving around in the file, entering Insert mode, etc. Once you get the hang of that, you'll find yourself cursing any editor that doesn't have an easy way to move to the end of the 3rd word from the current location.<p>That said, I think I'll eventually find myself using emacs in viper-mode, especially if I ever get around to migrating to Lisp (from mainly Python).",1214976352

All those links end up talking about the same 2 things over and over again:<p>- ads on the invites<p>- email bait you to visit the site<p>Great, but that's how they make money and they've been profitable with a small staff for a long long long long long long long long time.<p>Most of the other invitation sites focus on niches, Renkoo on the concept of friends getting together, Crush3r on hipster stylings, MyPunchbowl on coordinating the whole event, Socializr on being a social network, so on so forth. Besides Facebook, MyPunchbowl is the only other service getting quite a bit of traction. But it ends up being the same concept: single input info, multiple output info. I really believe this is a game of user conquest and attrition. Without the momentum and money to stay in the fight for the long haul, Evite (which has already been genericized) will just keep on chugging along.<p>Either way, good luck with the site and I'm sure you're much smarter than me at figuring out how to make this work.",1214975078

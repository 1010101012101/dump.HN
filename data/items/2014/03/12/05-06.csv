Sending a loud short ping once an hour shouldn&#x27;t consume too much energy. Of course, I don&#x27;t know enough about radio physics to know if it&#x27;d be enough, say, if it is 1km underwater - that may be a problem. Maybe supplement it with acoustic ping too?<p>GPS is not needed continuously too - it can record last reading, say, before high-g acceleration event and then let the GPS unit be destroyed, burned, starved of power or whatever happens to it. I.e. continuous GPS is needed only when everything is OK and the device is connected to the plane&#x27;s powerplant - once it is disconnected, record last known GPS and shut down everything - we&#x27;re in trouble, so the only task for it now is to scream loudly until it is found.",1394603920

Favorites add value to their recipients. Getting favorited helps a user get their tweets into the &quot;Top&quot; results for a search, rather than just hidden in &quot;All.&quot; Don&#x27;t people who&#x27;ve followed you as a result of the bot&#x27;s action deserve compensation from your bot?<p>It&#x27;s not the bot that&#x27;s harmful to the community as much as it&#x27;s your seeming lack of concern for the other people in it. For example, you are trying to have the bot benefit only its users, but this creates two classes of people, one of bot users and the other of normal users who end up at a relative disadvantage because they don&#x27;t use the bot. This is the fundamental problem that no bot which attempts to benefit its owner can escape.<p>The only bots that benefit the community are those that benefit everyone equally. Infobots are in this category, and there are several which Tweet stories as they appear here on HN (e.g. <a href=""https://twitter.com/newsycombinator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/newsycombinator</a>). Query/response bots which respond in useful or amusing ways also benefit the community equally.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m astonished that you say that your bot &quot;<i>can’t be shut down with ease</i>&quot;\nand then post the code to github, blog it, and post it to HN. This strikes me as akin to when someone used to smack someone else in the face with a glove to signal a challenge to a duel. Actually, given Twitter&#x27;s size and market cap, it&#x27;s more like waving a red flag at an angry bull. If you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll only gain the attention of a crack developer looking to prove you wrong about being shut down, which would be preferable over being contacted by someone from the legal team.",1394603482

(It will average the tail repeatedly.)<p>I cannot read Julia yet, so not sure about the Julia version, but the others do indeed look very much a quadratic time algorithm at the least.

It is better not to know about the patent if you get caught infringing because of the treble damage possibility that nknighthb referenced, but &quot;I didn&#x27;t know about that patent&quot; is a meaningless defense, you&#x27;re still on the hook for the base cost of the infringement, just not 3x whatever that base is.<p>In either the current situation or the one I think is worth considering, you either infringe or you don&#x27;t, nothing changes with regard to due diligence.  Many patents are infringed every day with the infringing party having no idea infringement occurred (see: Carmack&#x27;s reinvention of the z-fail stencil shadow system or any of countless other examples); but not knowing of the patent is absolutely not a defense.  This is one of the more insidious problems with the current patent system as it relates to software, there are so many broad patents currently active that you basically can&#x27;t avoid infringing all of them if you write any code at all, even if you never spend a second looking at other people&#x27;s patents.  The only variables are will you ever get big enough to be worth suing or not prior to the lifetime of the many patents you will invariably infringe.<p>Also, the idea that having a system where the IP holder is essentially forced to act to maintain control of the IP can&#x27;t, by definition, be &quot;impossible&quot; because it is already how trademark law works in the US.<p>And as I mentioned in the original post I made on this I recognize there would be some negative fallout from the proposed system, but I think over the long-run it efficiently adds in a lot of features to patents that are currently missing (eg. a lot of people have proposed a yearly fee to renew patents to make sure people don&#x27;t horde mountains of defensive garbage patents, this would achieve that same goal because they wouldn&#x27;t want to put the legal resources in worthless suits against known infringers, and thus their garbage patents would very quickly lose their power; also it would make it far easier for many unknowing infringers (see for example the recent audio podcast patent disaster that is still going on) to group up to fight garbage patents because the person claiming patent protection would be forced to pull them all in instead of using the current system which is &quot;go after the small fish, get a victory in East Texas, then use that to bleed everyone else dry&quot;.",1394602003

As stay out of the pressure of fast pace technology evolution, this career could be a winning path if you&#x27;re never a passionate programmer and ok to settle for a 9 to 5 job waiting the day to retire.  But the problem is, most programmers are never the type of person who can settle with these kinds of work to begin with.

7384060,comment,7381877,7383558,4,0,jedbrown,,,"1. Coordinating threads on a GPU means using shared memory effectively, which is required to get decent performance on most any application.  With many cores and hardware threads sharing cache on CPUs, it is also important for many applications if you insist on getting the best performance.  For example it is mandatory to get 90% efficiency on HPL using Blue Gene/Q.  Of course, not content with merely doing clever things to make their machines look good, IBM had John patent his cooperative prefetch: <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US8490071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US8490071</a><p>2. GPUs have less &quot;close&quot; memory (registers/shared memory/cache) per vector lane than current CPUs.  This means that to get high efficiency, you have to find fine-grained parallelism without additional overhead.  This is hard and it is common to see GPU algorithms make more round-trips to global memory than analogous CPU algorithms, eating into any benefits in raw bandwidth.<p>3. GPUs have a relatively narrow range of problem sizes in which they perform well.  You typically have to use a significant fraction of device memory to expose enough parallelism to keep all the cores busy, and yet the device has limited memory compared to the CPU.  On a GPU-heavy configuration, you have placed 90% of your compute next to 10% of your memory, connected by a straw (PCI bus) to the rest of the memory and the network.  That is not a recipe for a versatile machine.  CPUs give you vastly more flexibility in turn-around time (e.g., strong scale at >50% efficiency over a factor of 1000 as compared to 10).  GPU performance results usually choose a problem size that fills device memory, but science/engineering is often not that convenient.<p>4. Even for problems in which GPUs perform optimally (like DGEMM or HPL), the ratio in energy efficiency is only 2x.  See <a href=""http://green500.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://green500.org</a> for example.  Note that Blue Gene/Q is a CPU architecture that delivers the same energy efficiency as the GPU-heavy Titan.  Also note that Haswell improves Intel efficiency by 2x over Sandy Bridge.  The 1000x myth needs to die.<p>5. Enterprise GPUs (those with ECC) and Xeon Phi (MIC) are expensive ($3k-4k MSRP) relative to CPUs, and still need a host in almost all configurations.  In performance tests, normalize-by-shrinkwrap needs to die.  Normalize by total acquisition cost or by total energy consumption (always include the host, memory, network as applicable).",1394600474

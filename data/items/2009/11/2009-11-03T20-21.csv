The problem is, the executive is doing the work <i>now</i>, not in 5 or 10 years, and they're probably going to expect something for their efforts. If you delay too much of their compensation into the future, they'll get fed up and go work for another company that doesn't do it that way.<p>You could pay them up front with a clause that, if the company falters in some time frame, the executive (whether currently employed or not) owes some portion of the money back to the company--but there's no guarantee that you'll be able to collect from them. The executive could be dead, bankrupt, or have left the country.<p>And what if the economy blows up for some unrelated reason in five years, or some other external disaster strikes? Suddenly the company is doing terribly through no real fault of the executive, who is now stuck with not only having to find work in bad conditions but suddenly not getting paid for work he did over the last five years. What sensible executive is going to want to take that risk?<p>In general, there tends to be an incentive to push executive rewards closer to the short term, despite how much sense it <i>seems</i> to make that it should be the long-term view that matters, and regardless of how the shareholders may personally feel about it.",1257281947

If you see everything you can pick the best of a dozen posts and then use the authors white list. Once you have a human written white list to start from you can manage the volume by controlling the depth that you descend the search tree, and start adding authors you like to your direct list. Every time you add an author to your direct list you chose a number to set a search depth with him as the tree root and his direct list as the first level, so I think you quickly take control and adjust the list to your taste.<p>I'm more worried about how a new author gets read. Nobody sees his comments because he is on nobodies white list. I guess there has to be a slush pile. When people get bored they can turn to the slush pile and maybe find a gem. Alternatively one may wish to see all the replies to ones own posts, not just those from the authors on ones white list.

You otherwise assumed that health care is largely private in the US. It's not - it's about half public. Moreover, the public spending is concentrated on the poor. So, they're getting govt healthcare and buying big screen TVs.</i><p>What I assumed and is true is that healthcare is more private in the US than in Scandinavia, which it is. So the argument still holds that if you are comparing private spending in the US that will include more healthcare than in Scandinavia. Retail spending however will not as you don't buy healthcare as a retail good.<p>>As someone else has posted, the ""not get cancer"" stuff, which isn't due to health care, overmatches what happens when you get cancer, which is when health care matters.<p>What makes you think ""not get cancer"" has nothing to do with healthcare? Two very large healthcare factors come to mind. If you die sooner from another illness you won't get cancer and if you get continuous preventive medicine you won't get as much cancer. Diet and other unrelated factors will be important as well but ""not getting cancer"" has a lot to do with health care.<p>The other flaw in the whole ""cancer survival is higher so healthcare must be better"" argument is that although cancer is a very important illness it is far from the only important one and not even the major cause of death. Having very good cancer survival rates could just mean that the US healthcare spends an irrational amount of resources on it, neglecting other diseases. But I don't really know.",1257281852

We have high speed trains running impossibly fast on existing rail infrastructure - unless you can double that speed and break the sound barrier or something, there's no incentive to spend ludicrous cash on that sort of system.

920246,comment,920016,920196,0,0,grncdr,,,"I agree with all of your points, but I think many of these costs are minimized by the other point mentioned in the OP: following the UNIX philosophy. The smaller and simpler your service is, the better. If you have a service that can't be accessed with a simple API, you probably have more than one service, and would benefit from splitting it into multiple APIs.<p>Another thing worth mentioning is the possibility of building your API first, and then building your service on top of it. If you are providing a web service, then it [usually] boils down to data access and management. Figure out what data you are managing for your users and what you need to do with it, then build your API around that. If you plan to have a public facing API from the start, this approach makes sense (in the same way that using javascript only for progressive enhancement of a working site makes sense).<p>Of course, because you are an ""internal user"" of the API, you can bend the rules a little more than the average client, but the less you do this, the more useful your API is.<p>Regarding points 2 and 4: if public APIs for data access become the norm, this will simply become the cost of doing business. Secure API's aren't <i>that</i> difficult, and updating an API while maintaining backwards compatibility can be done, especially if you transition these changes and notify all broken clients.",1257281102

Plato's Republic says functionally the same thing - that an educated citizenry is essential for the proper function of the polis. Plato takes it to an extreme in the Republic, and people are still arguing whether or not he was serious about the extent to which he argues the point, but he definitely argued that education was essential.<p>And Aristotle says similar things in the Politics and Poetics. The citizens of Athens who participated at the Agora were literate, concerned men (unfortunately, only men).<p>The Roman Forum was open to any citizen, who bore the responsibility of educating himself before speaking.<p>Even modern political philosophers recognize that without an educated citizenry, democracy is impossible. Alexis de Toqueville in ""Democracy in America"" found the concern of the commoner for the welfare of the nation to be a key to the success of the American experiment of self-government under law.<p>Looking at how poorly educated our citizens are about the real issues of the day, it's no surprise that we are seeing problems in public policy. I'm not suggesting it's inevitable that the nation will collapse, in fact the article gives me hope we can turn it around. But it has to start with educating citizens about their basic responsibilities.<p>Of course, there are good and bad ways to do this. Heinlein had a model to ensure only concerned/educated citizens, and he presented it in Starship Troopers. So some thought should go into HOW we educate.",1257278843

I have no way of being certain, but I have to believe the use of Vala for projects like this (and Shotwell, etc) have a negative affect on community contribution. Not saying that&#x27;s a reason to use another language, but I&#x27;d bet the choice of python, C/C++, or something else would deepen the pool of potential contributors. I for one would rather not learn yet another language simply to contribute to Gnome projects, much in the same way I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of having to learn Obj-C for Apple-based projects; I simply don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use Vala or Obj-C outside of those contexts.<p>That said, there may be very valid reasons which are performance or convenience-related for choosing Vala.

They need to read stuff from disk / generate data in order to fill that memory in the first place, which takes time. I&#x27;m not an expert, but I would guess that using more memory also increases the chance that some of it will be swapped to disk by the OS, slowing things down further (although only intermittently).",1373295452

6007043,comment,6005584,6006557,1,0,oleganza,,,"I think it&#x27;s not an exaggeration that most of the people are exposed to state propaganda (or excuses for the state) since the very beginning. Most of people are educated in government schools where no teacher would seriously talk about being paid from taxes that are taken by force instead of voluntarily.<p>Do you think people pay taxes voluntarily? When you suddenly dislike NSA or war in Iraq, or war on drugs, or rape in prison, or torture in Guantanamo, or capital punishment or bank bail outs, can you protest by not giving a part of your money to the state? No you cannot, because there is always a gun pointed at you. And you know it very well. Similarly you cannot vote for no master or no taxes. You only get to vote when other people prescribed and for a narrow set of people who will decide how to spend money taken from you. And then you are being brainwashed to think that &quot;anybody who does not vote is not a patriot and should shut up&quot;. Somehow if me and my friends get together and vote something against you we don&#x27;t get magical power of Justice, but if some other bunch of people do the same, then they get that power. Think about it. People are killed because of these beliefs.<p>Religion in my view is not some particular kind of worship like christianity. Religion is a belief in higher matters that are more important than any human being. In case of government, it is a belief that the &quot;government&quot; is a special entity that actually exists and is important and has not only power, but must have such power to punish and reward individuals. While in reality no such thing exists. Government is simply a conceptual label that is used to excuse very real human beings when they point weapons at other human beings.",1373295196

I see a point there: Accessing that memory will take its time, being it RAM or not. However, memory consumption is a bad metric. One back-buffer of the background image, if any present, will make a difference of some megabytes.<p>The most important part, however, is to shed light on &quot;memory consumption&quot; and how to measure it. The latter is a hard, hard task and there are odds in the game. The values given by &quot;free&quot;, specifically, are only a (bad) indicator for the full system. E.g. have a look at those &quot;buffers&quot; and &quot;cache&quot; values. A lot of factors play a role: filesystem (c.f. btrfs vs. ext2), allocator (glibc?), sharing of dynamic libraries. I would specifically emphasize the last one: When you&#x27;re about to run mostly GTK based apps, you will probably profit when your desktop has already pulled all GTK related dynamic libraries into memory (e.g. GNOME, XFCE). Whereas some minimal window manager might have a small memory footprint because it merely uses the Xlib/Xcb - an advantage over the moment you start Firefox or GVim.

I&#x27;m not saying that capitalism is the same as corporatism; I&#x27;m saying that capitalists (people who control the capital, not supporters of capitalism) have an incentive to change a capitalist system to a corporatist system.<p><i>Isn&#x27;t there something fundamentally different which is also called capitalism? Without any reference to who owns the means of production, where mutually voluntaristic exchange occurs in an unhampered market scenario we call this process capitalism as well.</i><p>Capitalism necessarily entails ownership of capital; this is not to say that it&#x27;s the same as corporatism.<p>There are people who defend markets without defending capitalism: these are usually called mutualists, and they&#x27;re usually connoted with the left, though unlike state socialists, they defend a stateless society.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading this on the subject, but I&#x27;m still very early on: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Markets-Not-Capitalism-Individualist-Inequality/dp/1570272425"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Markets-Not-Capitalism-Individualist-I...</a><p><i>Saying &quot;the capitalists&quot; is a lot like the us vs. them tactic of left vs. right or republicans vs. democrats.</i><p>That depends on the intention, no? I wasn&#x27;t judging them, I was stating a fact about the incentives that people who own capital are subject to. This doesn&#x27;t mean that all capitalists are necessarily promoting corporatism; just that it&#x27;s in their self-interest to do so.<p>And again, this is hardly a leftist position, it&#x27;s (as I said) shared by people like Friedman, and it&#x27;s one of the arguments in favor of anarcho-capitalism.<p><i>What is &quot;an established capitalist&quot;? Is that somehow different than a run of the mill capitalist?</i><p>It&#x27;s what it says. There are established companies and startups, and there are established capitalists and young entrepreneurs trying to compete with them.<p><i>If you buy into the outmoded doctrine of profit seeking automatons as &quot;capitalists&quot;, then your argument works. Competing theories of the firm have discovered the tendency toward revenue-maximization versus pure, blind monetary profit maximization.</i><p>Having state protection against competition helps with both. But again, this is not a judgment of individual capitalists, it&#x27;s statement about the incentives they have. It doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re all bound to lobby, they just have a incentive to do so.<p><i>Just because you recognize that utilizing a state&#x27;s ability to assign perks to business is properly called corporatism as well doesn&#x27;t mean that you aren&#x27;t conflating this process of exploitation with genuine free-market capitalism.</i><p>My point is that economic systems are not immutable; a free market capitalists system can be replaced by a corporatist system, much like feudalism was replaced by the current system.",1373294713

6006939,comment,6006393,6006716,18,0,Jd,,,"Additionally, it is worth noting that the weakest target is very often the human element. Although this was noted by Mitnick in his &quot;hacking&quot; (which generally was just clever social engineering), it is equally true when governments are targeting you. The stasi (or other pernicious organizations organized to carry out state censorship) could easily have someone smeared in the press, dismissed from their job, or many other means short of official imprisonment.<p>To the point of encryption, as noted by the NSA (inclusive of present revelations), it actually makes you a target for state surveillance. This is a bizarre catch 22. If you are using facebook and &quot;rah rah-ing&quot; about Obama or the latest political fever you probably are at very little current risk of long term data retention. The government doesn&#x27;t care about you. If you slip into politically suspect views and/or start encrypting your messages simply because you don&#x27;t want the government to read them, you attract government attention, including the likely possibility that your communications will be retained.<p>Moreover (and this is where it gets scary, even if it wasn&#x27;t already), the likelihood is that the many people that are part of your social graph (even if you aren&#x27;t involved in social networks, some friends likely are and have probably shared their email contacts at the very least), governments can very easily figure out your social circles, and how suspect they may be from any standpoint that the government cares about.<p>Today this may be &quot;terrorism&quot; (itself a vague term, but one that at least nominally includes the threat of violent acts), tomorrow it may simply be having politically incorrect opinions of some variety. As noted by many, even the nominal but legally actionable protections for American citizens have been eroded to the point that the executive branch can hold anyone in infinite detention without trial. A world without borders has become the panopticon, a jail where we are bound by ever-peering eyes of our peers.<p>&quot;What you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law&quot; -- even if you said it 10 years ago when you were drunk in a private message on Facebook.<p>Welcome to the Brave New World.",1373293908

You have teachers sandwiched between layers upon layers of administration and the kids&#x27; parents. You have a lot of parents who&#x27;ve dumped all their educational responsibilities onto the schools. You have the administrations whose main purpose seems to be meeting stats. And after all that, you have the kids, awkwardly categorized by age, pushed through hoops with no clear purpose except to pass tests. This costs a tremendous amount of resources (not just talking about money here), and for what results?<p>We seem to live in an age where we think everything has to be, and is worth measuring. I believe the &quot;Level up&quot; system is a result of that, it makes it much easier to assess people&#x27;s worth, whatever the hell that worth may be. Ironically (and sadly), the only way to get out of this is real Education, one that promotes curiosity and self-growth for the sake of it (and eventually for the greater good).",1373293397

Joel Spolsky says you should never do it but he&#x27;s flat wrong, mostly, he&#x27;s right in that it&#x27;s almost never done correctly.<p>Most rewrites are undertaken too lightly and with too much naivete. They are approached as projects with a lot of major unspoken assumptions. Often assumptions that are counter-factual. Assumptions such as: at code complete we will have a system that is as refined and defect free as a well-worn system that has been in real-world use for years. Or, there will be no problem with forcing every user to use the new system because it will be in every way objectively superior to the old system starting on day 1. Or, taking on the work of a rewrite won&#x27;t cause a serious shortage of manpower needed to maintain the old system (or vice versa, the rewrite won&#x27;t face a serious shortage due to the needs of maintaining the old system). And so on.<p>Yet such obvious fallacies remain as latent assumptions behind the majority of rewrites.<p>There are different ways to do rewrites effectively and none of them are easy.<p>One way is to build a parallel product using an entirely separate team, and having that product compete against your older product directly in the marketplace. This is obviously an expensive route, which is why a lot of companies shy away from it, but sometimes it&#x27;s the best way to go about things. It gives a chance for a product to mature before it replaces the original. Microsoft did this with Windows, having two parallel teams work on different kernels (NT and 9x) and it took over half a decade for the &quot;rewrite&quot; to win out. This is even more astounding when you consider that originally Microsoft had intended for Windows 95 to be simply Windows 4.0 based on the NT kernel. A goal they didn&#x27;t really achieve until Windows XP was released 6 years later.<p>An alternate way to do a rewrite is through refactoring style techniques. Start building the new system inside the old and slowly deprecate and migrate components piece by piece until the old system is entirely gone. This is a very effective way of doing things and has the advantage of being able to scale relative to the amount of development effort available but certainly has its fair share of limitations and downsides (which I won&#x27;t enumerate).<p>As far as the Netscape example, they ended up coding themselves into annihilation, as their constant rewrites and architectural buffoonery led them to create a very unstable and clunky browser that was markedly inferior to IE 4 when it hit the market, and they just were not able to respond with any degree of innovation software wise. Also, my understanding is that the seed code for the mozilla project was a horrendous mess that didn&#x27;t even represent a functional browser at the time and required extensive effort to get to that point.",1373293307

A broadcast is a single transmission that can be received by anyone without impacting the ability of others to then receive it. For large numbers of viewers/listeners it&#x27;s a very efficient method of delivering information, and very cost effective, only having to pay for one big transmitter and a license for one channel.<p>If we look at it in terms of data-rates, a typical DAB radio channel may be 128kbps and might reach a million people.<p>Using a WiFi mesh network would mean that 128kbps audio stream would need to be transmitted to each user individually, so that&#x27;s increased the data transmitted by a factor of 1 million (or however many listeners there are). Of course this is spread over the whole listener base, the real impact would be much more localised. Perhaps 10 people are listening to the same stream on &#x27;your&#x27; mesh. That&#x27;s still 10 identical streams going to 10 people where before you only had 1.<p>Of course there is IP Multicasting which reduces this problem, not sure how it would work in a Wireless Mesh environment though.",1373292542

There are 4 points labeled 2:25PM, 3 points labeled 2:26PM, and 5 points labeled 2:27PM.<p>The altitude data is all rounded to the nearest 100ft. Obviously this is coming from transponder data. The mode C transponder carried by an airliner reports pressure altitude back to the interrogating radar at 100ft intervals.<p>Vertical velocity is all multiples of 60fpm. I have no idea where that would be coming from. As far as I know, vertical velocity is not transmitted by either radar transponders nor the newer ADS-B position broadcasting equipment. Simply taking the derivative of reported altitude wouldn&#x27;t produce these results, because with 100ft altitude intervals and 15s reporting intervals, that gives you a vertical velocity resolution of only 400fpm.<p>Let&#x27;s skip that question for the moment. The raw altitude data does show an increase from 100ft to 200ft at the end. But what conclusion can we draw from this? Essentially nothing. Because the altitude is so quantized, this could in theory indicate anything between a 0ft and 200ft increase in altitude, non-inclusive. Of course, the instruments are not that precise, so in practice the range is even larger. This is especially true given that the instrument was in the middle of a fairly violent plane crash when it gave that last reading. From the video of the crash, it&#x27;s clear the plane never got very high above the runway. Since the runway is only 13ft above sea level, and the plane didn&#x27;t crash into the ocean, the amount of climb possible is very much limited. The transponder may well have increased in altitude a bit for this last reading, but if so, the alignment with the reported altitude increase is pretty much just coincidental.<p>Now back to the vertical velocity. Where did it come from? I can only speculate that they&#x27;re applying some kind of curve-fitting or smoothing to transform the coarse altitude data into smoother vertical velocity figures. These numbers are therefore even less reliable than the altitude figures, and can probably just be ignored.<p>Just to briefly support that last bit, there are some obvious numerical anomalies in the vertical velocity figures earlier in the flight. At 9:38AM, the data source briefly switches from &quot;FlightAware Transoceanic&quot; to &quot;Oakland Oceanic&quot; and then back again. The two Oakland data points show an altitude of 37,000ft, while the FlightAware data shows 34,000ft. The vertical velocity for these four points is shown as 2280fpm, 9960fpm, -4320fpm, and -1800fpm. These changes obviously didn&#x27;t actually happen (otherwise we&#x27;d have heard about people being flung about the cabin in mid-flight!) and are just some sort of reporting anomaly. The ridiculous vertical velocity figures (nearly 10,000fpm climb accompanied by a minor <i>increase</i> in horizontal speed!) are obviously just some sort of post-processing going crazy trying to fit the bad altitude data.",1373292448

When things like bandwidth are free, the demand tends to be higher than supply. Limited bandwidth then limits the possibilities.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing a system where you would pay to &quot;TOR Ltd&quot; for their services. Instead the &quot;economy&quot; should be network based, with no single entity controlling it. If I wanted to send stuff through the network I could say that I&#x27;m willing to pay x coins for this. The network would figure out cost efficient route and the participating nodes would get the payment. If I wanted to earn money (or credits), I could do so by putting my machine as part of the network and offering my network capacity to others.<p>If thinks would work out well, there would be people earning some money by running nodes on the network. Just like they are people investing in Bitcoin mining rigs.",1373292221

The closest thing we have in IT is the ACM code of ethics (<a href=""http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics</a>), but that gives conflicting guidance in some areas (e.g. &quot;1.7 Respect the privacy of others&quot; and &quot;1.8 Honor confidentiality&quot;).<p>I understand that there are many good, well-intentioned people working for the NSA and similar organisations doing what they at least perceive to be something in service of their country. I also understand that many people just view their job as a source of income, and the moral or otherwise nature of their employer&#x27;s business is something they consider to be outside of their concern.<p>I personally have refused to get involved with the local defense industry in my hometown of Adelaide (which is perhaps the largest employer of software engineers in my state) because I didn&#x27;t want to find myself working on projects I was personally uncomfortable with.<p>Should the people involved with building and maintaining these systems (to the extent that they are aware of how the systems are used and the moral/ethical/legal violations involved) be considered responsible in part? There&#x27;s no rule I&#x27;m aware of that says you can&#x27;t just refuse to take part in a project if you&#x27;re not comfortable with it.<p>EDIT: One other point I forgot to mention before is that these mass surveillance systems only exist because there are people willing to build them.

And quite frankly I can't tell if they're happier for it or not.  Perhaps you can't enjoy life without living it up, but on the same token, perhaps others can't enjoy life without making something big.",1200337038

I was the only guy in my college dorm with a computer, an Apple //e, when my neighbor announced he was getting a PC Jr.  As a dedicated fanboy (even back then) I was nervous that my Apple would be crushed by the IBM giant.  I was instantly relieved when I saw his chiclet keyboard and surmised that my computer was still the cool one on campus.<p>I lived to type in adventure games from Creative Computing, inCider and other mags that published BASIC code.

The TI-1000 was particularly atrocious, although the PCjr wireless keyboard was pretty godawful.<p>The old-school HP, IBM, and Sun workstation keyboards -- seemingly cleft from a solid block of metal, with a satisfying <i>CLICK</i> on each keypress -- get my vote as the best keyboards ever made.  It was a sad day when I looked at the HP and IBM white-box models in a store one day and realized that the good keyboards were no longer being made.",1200336787

The macro facility is what differentiates Lisp from other dynamic languages that have, seemingly, all of the same attributes--dynamic/lexical scope, closures, etc.<p>They allow you to write a true DSL. Paul Graham pretty much wrote the book on the subject (On Lisp) which he graciously offers as a free download since it's out of print.",1200335830
98238,comment,98182,98182,0,0,sspencer,,,"I had one boss who was incredible.  He let you do your own thing as long as you got results, and he worked his way up from the bottom.  He detested meetings and preferred to just drop by for a few minutes a week to make sure we were happy.  He never bothered us about logistics, and we never told him what he wanted was unfeasible, mostly because he knew exactly what we could and could not deliver.<p>Contrast that with my current boss.  He is leader of a failing group and knows it.  He cannot relate to us because he spent so much time away from coding.  He asks unreasonable demands in impossible timelines.  He has no concept of how long it takes anyone to do anything.  He loves meetings and fills up his schedule with as many as he can.  He refuses to engage in ""laissez-faire"" management and constantly demands status updates, often in writing.<p>Guess why I am quitting.  Guess which boss I am returning to when I quit.",1200335729

But Thiel is actively against neoconservatism: he supports Ron Paul.* Apparently, in Guardian-speak, ""neoconservative"" doesn't mean a follower of Leo Strauss, or a supporter of aggressive war in the Middle East, it just means ""American stuff I don't like"".<p>I am not a fan of Facebook or Ron Paul or any form of conservatism.

I have a Master's in CS and in college we studied mainly Java, along with some Lisp and C, but I try to do all my current programming in Ruby.<p>In an effort to not be a Blub programmer I have taken another look at Lisp to see what I'm missing, but I'm afraid that I can't really see it.  I found this page http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby.rb which explains Closures in Ruby and after looking through that I don't really see what I could do with Lisp that I can't do with Ruby.<p>Again, I'm not looking for a ""OMG Python is better than both"" I would just like some honest answers about what the differences are. It's always worth it to learn new languages but would it be a better use of my time to start over and learn Lisp or just learn how to proficiently use Closures in Ruby?<p>Any comments, questions, etc. would be appreciated.",1200334468

A person could say that numbers don't exist too because humans were the ones that created names and rules to manipulate and measure them.

This would enable the fund to benefit from the diverse perspectives and experiences that the various members of the partnership bring to bear, ultimately enabling the partnership to make better investment decisions.<p>However, evaluating a business takes a lot of time and is an accretive process. As a partner learns more about a company they are more likely to uncover investment risks. As a result, it is critical for there to be continuity in the due diligence process X VCs want the same person digging deeper and deeper. If every partner was trying to become a specialist on the same company, the firm wouldn't be able to evaluate many companies.<p>Given all of this, in a world where the only goal is to make the absolute best investment decisions every time, it would be optimal for every partner of a VC fund to focus all of their time on the same deal until they are ready to invest. Unfortunately, that's not realistic because each venture fund needs to deploy a target amount of capital in a given time period in order to meet their investor's expectations. In order to meet these expectations, partnerships collectively need to evaluate numerous businesses at any given time. As a result, in order to make enough high quality investments in a given time period firms ""divide and conquer"".<p>This dynamic has led to the creation of a few different decision making models which I have described below.  It is worth noting that not every fund's decision making model will fit cleanly into one of these categories, however, this framework should give entrepreneurs a way to think about how a fund's decisions are made:...",1200333904

I hope it's just the messed-up, non-generic user settings on my computers, but the amount of crap I've had to do makes Linux a complete impossibility for anyone who doesn't know what hexadecimal code is.  But I accept the bullshit, because I know it's a right of passage, and it's worthwhile to know what a disk image, a disk ISO 9660 format (or is it file system?), a BIOS, booting priority, repartitioning, defragmenting, checking md5 hashes, and a virtual machine is.  I'm going to make it happen if it takes me all week.  But from a user-friendliness point of view, this is hell.  I shouldn't have to know any of those things. I hope my situation is rare, because if it's not, the linux community has some serious problems.",1200333627

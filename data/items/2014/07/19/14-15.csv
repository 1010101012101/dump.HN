Many russians do not support any war or aggression against Ukraine and many are convinced, that Russian government is in some way responsible for this tragedy.<p>I personally believe we, as people, will never know the truth as to who did it - was it Ukrainians or the rebels or the Russians. However, this is the direct result of the existence of states and governments. We are taxed to build weapons and go to war for some private and corporate interests we have nothing in common with. Those weapons were built for our money. If each and every person was asked separately &quot;would you like to give us 10% of your income to build these deadly weapons and support the rebels in Ukraine or would you like to keep this money for your family&quot; nobody would give it away voluntarily. Taxation and states are at the root of this evil and it is at moments like these that I can see it as clear as ever.",1405781970

The point is that I am using academia&#x27;s own insights to bridge a major gap. Academia (say Theoretical Computer Scientists) don&#x27;t take their next-door neighbors (the Linguists) seriously.

8057629,comment,8057346,8057614,11,0,eevilspock,,,"I agree, but it&#x27;s an absolute fallacy that consumption is free. In fact, it is more much more expensive with ads:<p>1. The advertisers who pay for it all still get their money from us, but baked into prices of the things we buy from them. There is no free lunch.<p>2. The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too. Ad systems and data collection systems, ad engineers and people like the author. Ad agencies. Creative agencies. Ad tracking. Marketing departments.<p>3. We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because they live or die by giving advertisers what they want (what we want only indirectly and secondarily, if at all). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as well as design that optimizes advertising revenue. As has been said, we are more Google&#x27;s products than we are their customers.<p>4. We pay the social costs. Democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising is predominantly about manipulation and deceit. To me this is the most expensive cost of all.<p>Added together, we are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; web content and services than if we could just straight up pay web sites for straight-up ad-free versions. A system to make that convenient is possible, but we&#x27;re too hooked on ads to even try.<p>[This is a condensed version of a more detailed case with reference links that I made here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773</a>]<p><i>&quot;Everyone gets that advertising is what powers the internet, and that our favorite sites wouldn’t exist without it.&quot;</i><p>The author nails the two sources of the problem, that advertising drives the internet, and that everyone believes we have no choice.",1405781868

8057608,comment,8057435,8057435,14,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this subject for a few years now. Like many HN&#x27;ers, I work deep inside the tech industry. I&#x27;m also fortunate enough to have watched the operations of dozens of different companies.<p>I think the real problem here is that the tech industry does not know how to manage their workers. I&#x27;m not talking about managing projects, or how to coach or train. I mean the whole thing. The technology sector of the economy has no idea of exactly how many workers, in what configuration, it needs for accomplishing any job.<p>Weird situation, I know. But where that leaves us is a lot of &quot;open&quot; job positions that are little more than unfulfilled wishes. Sure would be nice to have another 40 guys on the helpdesk. Would that be as nice as 10 more developers? Who knows? Or -- we&#x27;ve got that big government project coming up, so we&#x27;ll need at least 500 IT workers. Why do we need it? Who knows? It&#x27;s a big project. It should have a lot of people on it, right?<p>The implications of this is that there&#x27;s a huge downward pressure on wages. People want a certain number of tech workers, but there&#x27;s no market pressure to hire them or even to lay them off if they&#x27;ve hired too many. They just want a certain number. So what they really want is really cheap, disposable workers that they can easily swap in and out as the political winds inside a company changes. The U.S. labor market isn&#x27;t really geared for that.",1405781477

In January, \n  the Navy proposed the company end production of new \n  Tomahawks in 2017 . Its stockpile of about 3,000 of the \n  missiles is more than the 2,300 that have been fired in \n  all combat operations combined.\n\n  Raytheon is warning that if it shuts down production \n  of the Tomahawk and the U.S. finds itself in a situation\n  where it needs more of them, it will be complicated and\n  expensive to get production going again.\n\n  &quot;Raytheon contends that halting its Tomahawk production\n   line in Tucson, Ariz., ahead of the 2019 upgrades \n   would drive some suppliers out of business, and push \n   engineers to other sectors, eroding the military’s \n   ability to field an important weapon. The company \n   sent the Pentagon a list of a dozen companies that \n   Raytheon executives believe could close or be forced\n   to leave the defense sector, according to people \n   familiar with the situation.&quot;[2]\n</code></pre>\nIf defense suppliers can be tamed, so can be prison guard unions and law enforcement unions.<p>The criminal justice system and the incarceration complex are no longer in the purview of reasonable actors and decision makers.<p>Watch Bill Maher&#x27;s monologue on the increased militarization of local law enforcement( I know he can be hyperbolic sometimes, but not here. )<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qBTy0HWWI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8qBTy0HWWI</a><p>NYPD officers just choked dead a Staten Island man who was allegedly selling tax-free contraband cigarettes, for \nresisting arrest.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man...</a><p>Video<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZEYOSRiQno"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZEYOSRiQno</a><p>[1]\nTomahawk component suppliers and sites where the missiles\nwere fired:<p><a href=""http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CN552_TOMAHA_G_20140702165704.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CN552_TOMAHA_G_...</a><p>[2]\nDefense Companies Warn: Cutting Military Spending Can Be Expensive<p><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/03/defense-companies-warn-cutting-military-spending-can-be-expensive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/03/defen...</a>",1405781446

Putting these countries as frowny on the chart is not really very accurate even if they profess disdain in public (which they politically have to for an outlaw group like this). I hope the US is not in this group but wouldn&#x27;t swear they are not. At minimum, some of the &quot;friends&quot; of the US are in this group.<p>The absence of Russia on the chart is another reason not to take it very seriously.

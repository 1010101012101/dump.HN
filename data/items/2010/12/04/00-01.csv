1967997,comment,1967650,1967650,0,0,randall,,,"So being one of the few people in this thread that has worked with Jason, I wanted to chime in for a second.<p>Jason is totally demanding and pushes everyone around him to their limits. Yes. True.<p>But, underneath all the bulldog, seriously the guy has a heart of gold. Sometimes he doesn't show it, and even he'd admit some level of narcissism, but from personal experience, I can fully say that working with Jason changed my career for the better in every way.<p>I originally worked with Jason at Weblogs, Inc., and as we were acquired by AOL, worked with him on the relaunch of Netscape. I went through a personal tragedy during the launch of the site, and Jason / the team were instrumental in me coming out of that with my wits about me.<p>To be clear: Jason is hard to work with. He does joust publicly, which I would attribute to his form of marketing.<p>I have absolutely no inside knowledge of his actual tactics, but my guess is he takes on someone who he knows people don't like, then points out their flaws over time, figuring eventually he'll come out on top since his side of the story looks so rosy by comparison. Oh, and he does this by being fairly hyperbolic. (Mainstream media, junkets in journalism, Gawker, Pay-to-play angels, SEOs, off the top of my head.)<p>That all aside, I think working with Jason set me up to have a wide-eyed view of startups. I treasured the experience, and while I think everyone should evaluate their personal limits carefully before embarking on a career with someone who will literally push all of them, I don't think anyone who's worked with him has regret the time they spent with Jason. That doesn't mean all of them want to work with him again... but I heartily encourage anyone who wants to be pushed to work with him. It will be a hugely rewarding experience professionally.

Cool story, bro!<p>It's the way he gives the impression that the only thing he seems to value in his employees is how much they're willing to kill themselves for the sake of the company.<p>Above all, it's this apparent feeling of entitlement that he <i>deserves</i> to have the best people in the world working for him. This might be justified if he'd sold his last two companies for ten billion dollars a piece and made all his employees rich. But according to wikipedia he's sold one company for the $30 million range; presumably enough to make the founders rich but only to give a modest payoff to the employees. If the best he can say is that some of his employees make $100K after getting $30K for the first few years (compared to a big company where they'd instead make $100K after getting $75K for the first few years...) then I'm really not sure where this sense of entitlement is coming from.",1291423433

You sound like you're in a pretty dark spot and there's nothing you're going to get done at work in the next week that's more important than sorting out what's up.<p>Are you near family? Are you near friends who are good enough to be family, but don't work at this job? Get one of them on the phone, tell them what's up, that you need an afternoon of their time to relate your troubles. And unburden yourself.<p>Hopefully they can give you some good insight, because they know you so well, but it doesn't really matter what they say. This is rubber duck debugging for your life and well-being. You're <i>exhausted</i> and it's dripping through your post. Taking some time to work through what has you so miserable will be crucial to you getting some peace.<p>If you can afford it, fly or drive somewhere for a couple of days. Turn off your work email if it's delivered to your phone. Get some perspective. It's easy to believe, especially in startup land, that your job is your life. It isn't. It isn't even remotely close. One day when you upload your brain to a digital substrate and instantiate your consciousness in a virtualized environment, you won't even bother remembering this.<p>None of us can tell you what you should do about your career or your job at the company. But I can tell you, emphatically, that you need some distance from the day-to-day of this job before you can make good decisions for your life. That you care about your friends is admirable, and I respect your passion for getting them out, too. Whoever hires you with the ability to truly see your value is going to be especially lucky. But right now, you can't worry about them. Focus on what you need. Once you're okay, you can work on them.<p>Others have suggested you see a doctor – I would agree with this advice as well if you feel you're in a downright dangerous spot with regard to your mental health.<p>edit: Related only through mental state... (cool story, bro alert!)<p>Around this time last year, my ""fuck working for the man, I'm going it alone!"" plan had gone pear shaped because I suck at networking and chose a cheap but isolated town as my new home. The plan mostly backfired because it was predicated on my finding some part-time work after moving. Only problem was: 20% unemployment in my new town. Oops.<p>So, despite making some decent money from iPhone app sales, I wasn't growing my revenues fast enough because of this unexpected hole in my income. Burned through cash that should have lasted a year in about six months.<p>Miraculously, after six months striking out despite solid credentials and work experience, a place finally got back to me about a part-time position.<p>At Target.<p>I love customer service, so the cash register bit was extremely fun for me. Stocking shelves and tidying the store, though, that made me miserable. Tedious and Sisyphean, since it was the holidays and kids would destroy the toy merchandising you'd just spent half an hour on.<p>I told my management I hated the merch work – and they respected my passion for doing customer service. But I'd be farming the store for another two weeks. That's how the schedule worked.<p>A week of eight hour shifts like this brought me to the brink. I was miserable. When I wasn't at work, I was constantly dreading my next shift. It was a distraction from my development projects, which ceased to give me joy. I was unkind to the people who care about me. Perhaps immaturely, I was especially ashamed to be making minimum wage for the first time in my life – even in <i>high school</i> I'd done better than this.<p>So one night my shift starts. I'm an hour in. Yet more merchandising misery. I can't fathom another six hours of this. I'm at my breaking point.<p>So I smile. I realize that, while I often forget this, I am free.<p>I push my tub of orphaned merchandise out of anyone's way. I walk to the store's office area and check in my radio, keys and scanner. I find the general manager and explain that I have to leave immediately and I'm not going to come back. She was surprised and confused – she'd complimented my work several times. She explained if I left like this, Target wouldn't ever hire me again.<p>I was okay with that.<p>I signed some papers and left. On the one hand – I couldn't believe I was doing this. I'd always been Mr. Responsible. Always gave ample notice. Always the guy you could count on. But in the end I knew that my well-being was more important than being the guy for some retail store in the middle of Oregon.<p>My troubles, of course, were just beginning. I still needed money. I found gigs teaching people Excel, fixing people's Macs, but eventually the cash all ran out completely. But by then I'd found work in the Bay Area, I relocated, and all was well.<p></cool_story_bro><p>So in the end, if you're truly miserable, re-assert your control over your own life. It sounds that, like me, you've lost track of the fact that you're running the show.

1967976,comment,1965986,1967936,0,0,kragen,,,"Where are your cost numbers coming from? Ultimately, the cost of maintaining a domain registration record is a small text file in a filesystem somewhere, plus glue records copied into the parent domain.  I don't know of any filesystem that costs $3.50 to store a text file under 512 bytes, even including backups and filesystem administration.  Accordingly, there are non-TLD domains (e.g. dyndns) that let you register any number of subdomains at no cost.<p>Of course, support can cost any amount whatever.  But it generally doesn't cost very much. Mike Lawrie handled the entire South African .za domain single-handedly from 1994 until 2002 in his spare time.<p>The GTLD servers also bear a cost of answering queries, but that cost is zero for domains that nobody queries (most of them!) and in any case is not paid by registrars or registries.<p>Let me offer an alternative hypothesis. Domains cost money because they provide a valuable service, and competition in registry operators is nonexistent by the nature of the DNS. To register a subdomain of a particular parent domain, such as .com., you must pay whatever the registry controlling that domain chooses to charge, either via an intermediary such as a domain name registrar or directly.<p>Because subdomains of popular domains such as .com. are valuable and there is no competition in the market for them, you get to pay monopoly rents, which have fallen somewhat since ICANN wrested control of the GTLD monopoly from Network Solutions.",1291422811

1967961,story,,,10,11,KeithMajhor,"Show HN: CSS Meta-Language in Javascript",,"This was an attempt to make css more accessible to javascript. It just happened to solve a lot of the same problems as less and sass as a side-effect. I'll start with a few examples and then break out the code and explain it...<p>Here's a generic example:<p><pre><code>    css // Begin CSS\n\n    ( ""selector1"" )\n    ({\n        property1: value,\n        property2: value,\n        // ...\n    })\n\n    ( ""selector2"" )\n    ({\n        property1: value,\n        property2: value,\n        // ...\n    })\n\n    ; // End CSS\n</code></pre>\nSome less and sass features (Variables, Mixins, etc.):<p><pre><code>    // Variable\n    var text_color = ""black"";\n\n    // Mixin\n    var dim = function( w, h ) {\n        return {\n            width:  w,\n            height: h,\n        }\n    };\n\n    css // Begin CSS\n\n    ( ""div"" )( dim( ""10px"", ""10px"" ) )\n    ({\n        color: text_color,\n    })\n\n    ( ""span"" )\n    ({\n        color: text_color,\n    })\n\n    ; // End CSS\n</code></pre>\nAnd finally, since it's leveraging javascript this technique can modify styles dynamically (My goal):<p><pre><code>    item_color_input.onsubmit = function( )\n    {\n        css // Begin CSS\n\n        ( "".item"" )\n        ({\n            background: item_color_input.value,\n        })\n\n        ; // End CSS\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFrameworks like jQuery provide similar functionality by acting on the DOM. This can be slow (since it has to execute the selector in javascript) and doesn't affect future elements.<p>The Code: css.js http://keithmajhor.pastebin.com/twCKCcHV<p><pre><code>    // ==============================================\n    // File:   css.js\n    // Author: Keith Majhor <KeithMajhor@gmail.com>\n    // ==============================================\n    window.css = function( a )\n    {\n        var decl = { },\n            elem = { },\n            rule,\n            prop;\n\n        css = function( a )\n        {\n            if ( typeof( a ) === ""string"" )\n            {\n                rule = a;\n                if ( !decl[rule] )\n                {\n                    decl[rule] = { };\n                    elem[rule] = document.createElement( ""style"" );\n                    document.head.appendChild( elem[rule] );\n                }\n            }\n            else if ( rule )\n            {\n                for ( prop in a )\n                    decl[rule][prop] = a[prop];\n\n                var temp = rule + ""{"";\n                for ( prop in decl[rule] )\n                    temp += prop + "":"" + decl[rule][prop] + "";"";\n                elem[rule].innerHTML = temp + ""}"";\n            }\n\n            return css;\n        }\n\n        return css( a );\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAll it does is maintain a hash for each selector and update a <style> tag whenever it's modified. As is it's 500 bytes, minified it's below 300.<p>I hope this is useful to someone. If anyone has any insight into why this might be a really stupid thing to do, I'd love to hear it.",1291422064

The quick rundown is that based on your location is adjusts the brightness and color temperature of your screen to match the lighting around you as it transitions from daylight to inside lighting. It's a slow transition so you don't really notice it until you look at someone else's screen and notice that it's looks really blue. The biggest downside I've seen is that it can't control the brightness of all displays (my MBPs screen gets dimmed but the Dell 2405 stays at the same level).

There are two risks.  (1) is that you might go from something that works to something that doesn't work,  and (2) in theory the ideal way to drive up your traffic would be to make small incremental improvements,  watch your results,  then make more changes.  Google's very happy for you to do that if you're using AdWords,  but they don't like you doing that in SEO,  so there are things built into the system that can (sometimes) zap your ratings if you try to revamp an old site.<p>Personally I can think of better things to do if I had $100k sitting around,  but if you like this site you should think about trying to negotiate the price down.

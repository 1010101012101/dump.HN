It&#x27;s a claim that too often, static checked exception handling gets subverted, and therefore doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Sooner or later, you have to trust the programmer to not be an idiot.  If he/she <i>is</i> an idiot, the language can try to help, but can&#x27;t really fix it.<p>Static checked exceptions let the programmer know that there&#x27;s something that needs to be handled.  That&#x27;s good.  It can check that the programmer put a catch block somewhere, but it can&#x27;t guarantee that the programmer did anything appropriate to handle the problem inside that block.  It&#x27;s better than nothing, but it&#x27;s not enough.  (And if you&#x27;re going to ask what <i>is</i> enough, I have to reply:  Nothing.

7563345,comment,7560341,7560341,3,0,joshrael,,,"Thanks for the feedback everyone. Perhaps I should have included a bit more explanation.<p>I was primarily interested in an algorithmic approach to generating color palettes. I am familiar with the various tools available (Adobe Kuler being my favorite) that use color theory as a basis of providing colors to go with one that you&#x27;ve selected (i.e. complimentary colors, analogous colors, triadic colors). One the palettes that my app provides uses this approach.<p>Another approach I looked at was a trick that I&#x27;ve seen many designers use in which you &quot;mix&quot; a little of the color you want to use with another color. To play with this concept, I generate a random set of colors and blend it with the one that you&#x27;ve selected.<p>Finally, I am a huge fan of Gregor Aisch&#x27;s work [1] with colors in regard to statistics. My third palette borrows a method of his that I had not seen elsewhere. He essentially maps a particular color space into two dimensions and keeps the third constant. You can sample equidistant colors along a line in that space to derive a set of colors that look good together. In my case I used HSL, where I hold Lightness constant (I use the value of lightness of the color you selected).<p>As he mentions in the post I&#x27;ve linked below, HSL is not necessarily the best color model to use this way. A more perceptually uniform color space like CIE LAB would be better. However, working with this space in this way is a little more complicated because, since this color space models how we perceive colors, it has holes. I had trouble finding an elegant way around those holes such that I could consistently offer a fourth palette.<p>Anyway, after looking at each of these methods, I was curious if any one of them would rise to the top as the favorite among users. Or, perhaps one method would perform better for some colors over others. I am in the midst of processing all this data and my thesis should be published within the next month. Thank you for helping me collect data!<p>[1] <a href=""http://vis4.net/blog/posts/avoid-equidistant-hsv-colors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis4.net/blog/posts/avoid-equidistant-hsv-colors/</a>",1397087682

Drink more water. Not a crazy amount of water, but more than you already drink. The next few times you urinate, pay attention to the color. Watch the urine stream, not the water in the toilet. Is it much lighter/clearer than before? You were probably not drinking enough water before. Not convinced that there is a causal relationship between your hydration and urine color? Do a &#x27;washout period&#x27; where you go back to your previous hydration level for a day or two, then observe urine again, then increase hydration and observe again. Do <i>not</i> trust your thirst as a gauge of hydration. If you are thirsty, chances are you&#x27;re already dehydrated.<p>An exception to the &#x27;brightly colored urine is bad&#x27; heuristic is riboflavin:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#Toxicity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin#Toxicity</a><p>Excess dietary riboflavin is harmless. Other B vitamins can do this too, apparently, so you can expect your urine to look funny if you&#x27;ve taken a multivitamin recently.<p>More broadly, my advice is to keep an eye out for strange, unexplained changes in your normal physiological function, because these changes might mean trouble.<p>(Warning: possible &#x27;TMI moment&#x27; ahead.)<p>It amazes me when I walk up to a urinal and find that the previous person who used the urinal not only neglected to flush it (damn you!), their pee is a horrible dark brownish yellow color. This can&#x27;t be healthy. (The behavior that led to the brown urine, I mean, not my habit of noticing other people&#x27;s urine.)<p>Oh, and painful urination is definitely a concern (as in, tell your doctor), but I think you knew that already.<p>/end public service announcement",1397086330

What happens in 5 years when Tesla is 10x bigger than it is now...&quot;\n\n  * &quot;this blog entry leaves a sour taste with me.&quot;\n\n  * &quot;Yeah, this does not feel good to me. I get the PR angle but this feels not right to me.&quot;\n\n  * &quot;Thank you HN for hosting another Tesla public service announcement.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI think the amount of flak Tesla gets on a constant basis from numerous entities that want to see Tesla dead more than justifies their aggressive public stance on these kinds of matters. The lawyer involved is apparently a self-proclaimed &quot;Lemon Law King,&quot; which should raise a red flag all by itself. Litigious opportunism isn&#x27;t usually celebrated by the HN crowd and I don&#x27;t see why an exception should be made here. HN user yock has also pointed out that the lawyer involved in this suit is making a claim that the lack of franchised dealerships strengthens his justifications for opening a case, in that a lack of a dealerships for Tesla vehicles makes invoking Lemon Laws harder for consumers. Given Tesla&#x27;s recent battles with states over having to sell their vehicles through middle men, I agree with yock&#x27;s assessment that this is the real motivation for the suit --to add ammo to the case that Tesla must submit to the dealership franchise model-- rather than a genuine concern for a customer&#x27;s rights under Lemon Laws to reverse a purchase of a vehicle.<p>But if none of that is enough, there&#x27;s these gems:<p>><i>Ultimately, Tesla service applied non-tamper tape to the fuse switch. From that point on, the fuse performed flawlessly.</i><p>><i>After investigating, they determined that the car&#x27;s front trunk had been opened immediately before the fuse failure on each of the three occasions.</i><p>I&#x27;m all for stomping on double-speaking weasel-wording bullshit. It&#x27;s not OK when the NSA does it, or the State Department does it, or anyone else does it. That goes for Tesla too. But for some reason it seems a good chunk of the readers here are stomping on what is absolutely the wrong target. Tesla is speaking truth to power and attempting to disrupt a dinosaur of a market that is pulling out all of the stops in a truly glorious effort to kill Tesla off. Could we all drop the pseudo-skepticism act and take note of the plain truth as it is?",1397085346

Datagram protocols have a problem: if datagrams are too large, the IP protocol will need to fragment them. Fragmentation is calamitous for performance and reliability. So sizing datagrams is tricky. One technique for solving that is &quot;path MTU discovery&quot;. The original use case for TLS Heartbeats was, as the RFC spells out clearly, PMTU discovery.<p>The payload/padding split exists so that one side of the protocol can send large messages, and the counterparty can reply with smaller ones, relying on the fact that the message includes discardable padding.<p>It&#x27;s not a good protocol. The functionality is implemented at the wrong layer. And the inclusion of the extension into TCP TLS was a mistake, one (also) discussed on the mailing list. Unfortunately, the way standards work, it&#x27;s easier to say &quot;yes&quot; to new features than &quot;no&quot;, and it was easier to add the extension to both TCP TLS and DTLS than it was to hash out the argument of whether TCP TLS needed the feature.",1397085220

Well I don&#x27;t find it funny or think its dirty conotations have anything to do with food. I dont think its apealing and find it like so many mindless blogs a waste of my time.

In fact quite the opposite, for your information not everyone subscribes to your ideaology. Plain and simple I think your term is nothing but pornographic. So I&#x27;m not intrested in you trying to impose your crude version of a rediculous, anoying Rachael Ray like idiotic slang description for food or cooking.

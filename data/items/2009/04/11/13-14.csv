VCs would have to travel outside the country to meet potential founders (since they don't yet have a visa) There are enough founders in those two places that VCs don't have any <i>pressing</i> need to jump through such hoops.",1239458225

You can use aptitude or apt-get to install pretty much whatever you want, it will run on whatever hardware you have at the moment, and it's free of charge.<p>If you already have a Mac you could decide to stick with the Mac OS for development instead (I use it; it works fine), though you will almost certainly not be running Mac OS on your server. So you'll have to figure out Linux anyway sooner or later. The Slicehost tutorials make it much easier -- a lot of the grunt work has been figured out and documented.",1239457962

In fact, I see ""low hanging fruit"" that could really improve our economy and quality of life.<p>That said, I didn't really get an answer... you say you're in favor of increasing legal immigration - are you in favor of changing the mix, of do you think that we need to go way above the current level of 1.2+ million a year?",1239457119

This would just provide another entry point.<p>You would have to define what is a successful startup, in simple legal terms, and people would find ways to satisfy the definition and stay in the country.<p>I have experienced first-hand the difficulty of moving to a new country, adapting to a new system, trying to build a new social network.  Any genuine startup founders would have to contend with all this, all the while knowing that if their business fails they're booted out of the country.<p>Anyway, I believe the reason entrepreneurship works so well in the US is because we allow people to fail.",1239455884

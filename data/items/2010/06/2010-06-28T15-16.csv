The thought process of their president Florentino Perez (who makes new signing decisions, not the manager) must look like this:<p>1. Get a €300million loan from a bank.<p>2. Go out and buy as many attacking, 'flair-players' as possible. (Ronaldo, Kaka, Benzema).<p>3. Sell lots and lots of Real Madrid shirts.<p>Notice that winning  trophies does not enter the equation.

They also come back vary quickly vs jobs that fill wants.<p>B) Jobs that invest in the future are somewhat more stable than jobs that fill wants and they come back quickly as the economy improves.<p>C) Jobs that fill wants are the least stable because people need to feel that their future is very secure before they spend much in this category.<p>Government spending to prop up A or B can be cost effective, but to prop up C tends to be extremely costly.  In some ways money is less useful than confidence.   Consider the state of mind someone needs to be in to spend a weekend at a spa, get married in Hawaii, or buy an Accura vs. a Honda.<p><i>For example, if we have an excess of farmers that would be cleared up in the market as those not making enough income to continue being farmers would pack up and leave the occupation or try to get loans to maintain their employment long enough to weather the current conditions.

One is that the errors by the officials are unaccaptable and they must introduce technology to reduce them.  I'm not discussing that.  The other is that somehow the game is flawed because there aren't enough goals, and hence chance plays a large part.  I'm arguing that such claims are misguided.<p>In some sense the two are not entirely orthogonal because a single error by an official that leads to, or prevents, a goal has an enormous effect on the game.  Nevertheless, there are two issues, I'm talking about one, and you are talking about the other.<p>I'm discussing the point raised in the original submission.

1468308,comment,1468098,1468098,0,0,bradleyland,,,"To expand on the content in the article:<p>In the early days of our startup, we did some telecom consulting as a means to supplement income (a.k.a., make some money to pay employees/bills). We worked with smaller carriers who, despite their efforts, could never reach the level of reliability of the RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies) who had practically unlimited budgets and infrastructure that dwarfs anything a small firm could even conceive. Despite the fact that the smaller carrier delivered service that was sub-par compared to the RBOCs, the customer seemed happier. What gives?<p>The answer is pretty simple. With the smaller firm, it was possible to have your IT managers dial an engineer directly. When you call their office, you don't get an IVR; you get a human. The RBOCs have a policy of depersonalizing the customer experience. This is intentional, and is directly related to cost-cutting measures. Voice and data service has been commoditized, and any time your service is pushed in to the commodity space, cost-cutting is your only opportunity to increase profits. ATT/Verizon/Qwest/Etc are masters at this, and it is the cause of huge amounts of customer dissatisfaction.<p>The question is, how does this apply to you? When communicating with your customers (on your website, through your blog, or even on the phone), remember that often what separates the companies we hate from the ones we love is the personal connection. Don't be afraid to admit when you've done something wrong. Pay close attention to how often you have to do this, however. Recognize the areas where you or your team are incompetent and find talented people to fill the gap. Eventually, even the closest of connections to your customer will be frayed and severed by incompetence.",1277740139

From pages 28-29, with citations removed for readability:<p>---<p><i>""We reject such a broad holding. Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­ der of the statute. “Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.”</i><p><i>""Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,” ... the “normal rule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course”.</i><p><i>Under the traditional default rule, removal is incident to the power of appointment. Concluding that the removal restrictions are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will, and leaves the President separated from Board members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The Commission is then fully responsible for the Board’s actions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s own functions to Presidential oversight.</i><p><i>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “‘fully operative as a law’” with these tenure restrictions excised.

1468276,comment,1467871,1467871,0,0,PhysicsAndYou,,,"Wow a biophysics related article on HN. I can finally be an interesting commenter!<p>First and foremost, no one is writing off quantum mechanics. There are a lot of physical mechanisms that can't be well described by classical models: charge transport, some examples in protein folding, optical interactions, etc.<p>The issue is that current computational resources are limited. We can't even give a full MM (classical) simulation of a small virus without months of distributed computing efforts and thats with algorithms that scale like O(n^3).<p>Even DFT models that are pretty far from the theory we're looking at O(n^5). It'll be farther into the future before we can do more.<p>That said QM/MM simulations of macromolecules (DNA in particular) are extremely common though the goals may be quite different so I'm not entirely certain where the basis for the claim that CV entanglement is needed for stability at a physical level. They do such a simulation with 2 different factors for the VDW interaction and note that shrinking it by a factor 10 leads to stability issues. (Rather obvious claim in context)<p>The authors recognize entirely that this model is not going to be accurate. The question is, how inaccurate can you be before your results don't mean anything?<p>To me their work kinda straddles the line.
Issues with their simple model I see:
Lack of rotational degrees of freedom of the base-pairs,
Lack of a polarizing solution (water) !!! (Critical since the entire basis of this was the non-trivial mechanics of non-permanent dipole moments)<p>And of course the very obvious issues that arise from modeling DNA as just a plane of positive charge with a single electron orbital.<p>All they end up saying is that for that scaling factor at the very small value you don't get as much of an energy increase in the molecule that leads to instability in a ""normal"" QM/MM simulation. I'm certainly not convinced that this energy difference can be directly said to be because of entanglement and not just flaws in their model and certainly not willing to say that this small value represents anything physical.<p>There were a few more confusing things in the analysis but I admit I'm only glancing over the paper but I think the most we can take away from this is that there may be non-trivial effects of CV entanglement. Maybe that's all they really wanted.",1277739575

The Champions League is the best soccer competition on the planet, the World Cup is second rate by comparison.

Generally, top players play far better for club rather than country as they are more familiar with their club teammates, as they play with them, week-in, week-out, rather than just once in a blue moon. Also, by the time the World up comes around, many players are tired after a long club season - see England yesterday, for example.

The majority opinion declined to give much further guidance other than to emphasize that 1) the law should be interpreted using the plain meaning of words in the statute, and that 2) the machine or transformation test is not an exclusive test of whether a claim is patent-worthy.<p>Stevens, Ginsberg, Breyer, and Sotomayer concurred with the decision, but would have denied the application based on a more strictly defined interpretation of the word ""process,"" noting that the majority's acceptance of a looser interpretation ""can only cause mischief. The wiser course would have been to hold that petitioners' method is not a 'process' because it describes only a general method of engaging in business transactions—and business methods are not patentable.""<p>Breyer and Scalia separately emphasized that the machine or transformation test is still <i>useful</i>, though not exclusive, and that there is much agreement between the majority opinion and the concurring one.<p>--<p>At the end of the day, it appears that this decision will lead lower courts to continue ruling, with new reassurance, that patents on software and business methods <i>are</i> valid as long as the patent claims meet the statutory criteria of being novel, useful, and non-obvious.  Patent applicants simply need to be more careful than Bilski in ensuring that their claims don't on their face seem like common abstract ideas.<p>Given the language of the statute, the history of prior rulings, and the broad Constitutional authorization given to Congress to grant patent monopolies, it's difficult to take issue with their narrow ruling.  The real problem we face is one of modern information theory colliding with an 18th century experiment in government-granted monopolies.<p>This is the end of the road (in the US) for challenging these types of patents <i>en masse</i> via the courts in our lifetime.  The fight, if it is to continue, will now shift to influencing Congress to make changes.",1277738310

8771863,comment,8770732,8770732,0,0,akiselev,,," > For something of a smartphone class, a one-off PCB may cost several hundred dollars. Then the parts will cost another several hundred dollars in small quantities, as well as being difficult to obtain.<p>> Now, you have to solder the parts onto the board, which is a decidedly nontrivial thing - and if you decide you want someone else to do this, it&#x27;s probably another several hundred dollars.<p>I&#x27;d love to live in a developed country where these statements are true. For a &quot;smartphone class&quot; board with 6-10 layers, 0201 size passives (1.0 x 0.5 mm), and 0.4-0.5 mm pitch BGAs (almost all mid to high end ARM microprocessors) you&#x27;re talking about thousands of dollars of setup costs for each step of the process <i>before you even make a single board.</i> Reducing these costs to the hundreds of dollars requires a whole different world of expertise dealing with Chinese suppliers and manufacturers.<p>To give some perspective on how expensive it is for an EE working in California on non-trivial projects (more like RPi and less like Arduino): 10 boards with an ARM microprocessor, some DDR2/3 RAM, a multimedia processor, and a gigabit PHY on an 8 layer board can easily cost on the order of $5,000-7,000 with a month+ turn around time in the Bay Area. If I want the same design made in a week by reputable suppliers (such that I&#x27;m 90% sure that the issues I debug aren&#x27;t from fabrication or assembly errors for a first run of a design), it can cost me closer to $15,000. The difference between making 10 boards and a one off? Usually less than $500, or 10% of the cost of the best case. That&#x27;s usually not including the cost of parts which, unless you&#x27;re contracting or working for a big company, you&#x27;d be lucky to get without a friend who can wander around the Shenzhen electronics part markets and overnight stuff to you.<p>The problems just go on and on. Many of the useful parts like cameras, multimedia processors, microprocessors, and high end ethernet MACs/PHY often require signed NDAs before you can even get the documentation. Oh and if you want to work with anything considered high speed digital electronics (i.e. bus speeds of 133/266mhz for DDR1/2 RAM, 1GHZ for MIPI2 cameras), you&#x27;re now in the realm of RF (analog) electronics and intermittent bugs that can drive even the most talented and well equipped debugger insane.<p>Reality is messy and this is just one of those cases where the decks are stacked heavily against open hardware that is more complex than an Arduino. It&#x27;s telling that many of the open source projects like PandaBoard, BeagleBoard, or OpenRD were originally made as reference designs by companies like Texas Instruments and Marvell or as otherwise well funded initiatives like the RaspberryPi.",1418989781

It&#x27;s the best type of hiding: in plain sight.<p>The American approach is more annoying, yes, but it&#x27;s also more transparent: the consumer is forced to feel the full weight of tax, and can perceive how businesses are completely unaffected by it.<p><i>> &#x27;flat rate&#x27; or &#x27;proportional tax&#x27; is _not_ regressive</i><p>In practice, it is. If I pay the exact absolute amount of tax on a transaction for the same good, regardless of my wealth, then in practice it&#x27;s regressive because it will weight more on the less wealthy. A flat rate is less regressive when transactions differ (the same percentage of a bigger transaction will result in more tax), but this is not the case with VAT. As I said, the theory that this is compensated by rich people buying more expensive goods is just that, a theory; in practice, this does not happen n any significant scale.<p><i>> End customers have no VAT to claim back. [...] Now if you are running a business</i><p>Of course. My point is, most wealthy people <i>will</i> be running businesses, and hence will not pay tax on pretty much anything except the most outrageous items. Most of those Porsches and BMWs you see on the streets of London are not bought by individuals, but rather by (shell) companies such people run. They&#x27;re still managed exactly like they were an individual&#x27;s private property, but on paper they&#x27;re not and so there won&#x27;t be any VAT paid by such &quot;end customers&quot;.<p><i>> If you are a &#x27;n00b&#x27; employee then you pay it.</i><p>yup. And that&#x27;s my point: it&#x27;s a tax on n00b employees who cannot afford good accountants and shell companies. They&#x27;re the only ones who really pay it all.",1418987664

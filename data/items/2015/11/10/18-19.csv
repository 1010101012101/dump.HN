Taxi drivers get desperate because they can&#x27;t compete with someone who&#x27;s breaking the law, and they don&#x27;t have the money to ignore the law themselves. The genera population gets annoyed because they see government trying to mess up what seems to be a perfectly good service for them.<p>> <i>Many see the taxi-driver cartels for what they are, and act in the interest of the general populace by removing the restrictions. This restores trust in the administration.</i><p>If by &quot;many&quot; you meant governments here then I agree. Governments that see the cartels and remove the problematic regulations are seen as a good thing. But, at least in Europe, it&#x27;s often the case that those regulations arose for some reasons and are beneficial to the public. The government is reluctant to touch those.<p>> <i>And whether Airbnb actually damages the quality of life in neighborhoods is not proven, and I highly doubt landlords will get more suspicious.</i><p>It&#x27;s not proven in general, but it is in particular cases, by the sole virtue of reports and journalist investigations. Nobody is accusing AirBnB of only profiting off damaging things - but we have enough evidence to notice that those destructive deals are a big part of their business.<p>> <i>Insurance providers for vehicle owners (...) aren&#x27;t making noise, so the risk is only to incumbents&#x27; business models.</i><p>Why would they make noise? They just add a &quot;no Uber&quot; clause and get to happily keep their money when a person who didn&#x27;t notice (or elected to ignore) that particular point gets into a car crash while driving for Uber.",1447181840

I love my Nord Modular and also use a bunch of Elektron gear, but my favorite things in my signal chain are my analog 303 clone, an Ensoniq DP/4 (digital FX but with very, um, characteristic input and output stages, plus it doesn&#x27;t sound like any other digital FX unit ever designed), and a crunchy 16 channel Mackie mixer from the 90s that distorts wildly at high gain. It&#x27;s very hard to get rich, musically expressive distortion and feedback textures in the digital rather than the analog domain. It&#x27;s like an amazingly high resolution photo of a painting, full of detail, great color, you can see things you wouldn&#x27;t see with the naked eye etc. etc., and yet it&#x27;s fundamentally different from looking at or making your own actual painting with paint and brushes. My analog instruments and signal processors are much more limited than their digital equivalents, but within their range they are enormously pleasing to use - &#x27;you can&#x27;t get a bad sound out of it&#x27; as we say. It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine using a software emulation of the 303 now, even though I spent many long hours crafting such on digital platforms, and still find those emulations enjoyable in their own right - but they simply don&#x27;t deliver the same sort of sonic gratification as voltage-controlled stuff.",1447181805

You can do this:<p><pre><code>  if value, err := bar(); err != nil {\n    return err\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNote that this syntax declares &quot;value&quot; in the &quot;if&quot; scope.

10541461,comment,10539029,10539633,0,0,sbov,,,"For myself, there are a couple things that make Clojure difficult.  I believe they all stem in part from the language being simple.<p>First, there seems to be at least two ways to do things: the verbose way and the succinct way.  This creates more things beginners have to memorize.<p>Second, so many :keywords.  Presumably some function/macro needed to be made more flexible and/or more succinct for certain circumstances so they add magical (from this beginner&#x27;s POV) :keywords to make it translate their arguments in different ways.  Clojure functions seem more like Unix commands rather than functions in most programming languages I&#x27;m used to.<p>And finally, an imperative programmer&#x27;s tendency to create long functions.  As a beginner my brain starts to shutoff once I encounter a Clojure function that reaches 5-10 lines.  But 5-10 lines in an imperative language is pretty short.<p>Clojure is a simpler language, but because of that it doesn&#x27;t benefit from the syntax highlighting more complex languages may have.  This makes it more difficult (for me) to parse similarly lengthed Clojure programs.  Of course similarly lengthed Clojure programs can do more than an imperative language, so it should probably be split into more functions, which would make it easier for me, as a beginner, to read.<p>I feel like people tout the succinctness of Clojure as a benefit because you can write shorter programs.  I&#x27;ve come to think it&#x27;s a benefit because you can section off more of your code into descriptive functions without exploding your code length, which make the program easier to read.  When I start to use that succinctness to write less code it quickly becomes unreadable if I revisit it in a month.",1447181745

The good thing is that the ideas are spreading - Victor Bret&#x27;s talks have had a significant impact in developer circles, and more people are taking parts of them in their own project, or at least recognize them and understand their value.<p>If this means that, this time around, adopting the methods will take a distributed approach of many people including piecemeal parts of the global idea in their pet projects - rather than everything coming together from a single entity, so be it. The times are a-changin&#x27;.<p>>  Start by throwing away superstition about how computing is currently done and lets look at other ways we could do it, rooted in well-understood theory. It&#x27;s a shame that this kind of development is rare and most of the industry is bandwagon-hopping.<p>Agree. I believe it&#x27;s largely a matter of inertia, of which computing industry is a major culprit. Back in my time we learned to build the control flow of applications for the command line using a top-down main menu, that stalled waiting for user input, and then called the subroutine for the selected command when the user choose its action number;  that was simply how applications were made, we simply didn&#x27;t know there was a different way. Yet nowadays everyone knows how to use an active event-loop that mixes user- and application-initiated actions.<p>But at the end, all that inertia is overcome when knowledge about the best processes spreads. The form fields and radio options in HTML appear in essentially the same shape of banking applications in the 60s, which were the result of user-centered research and thus are well suited for the problem they solve. But we now use declarative languages for building the forms and have specific widgets for accessing their values, instead of relying on ad-hoc low-level code for showing the fields and reading their input.<p>So there&#x27;s hope that in the long term the best ideas spread, and ultimately they become unattached from the legacy practices where they were first seen.",1447181550

My opinion indeed implies a radical departure from the current state of the business, but it seems to me that my colleagues are by and large in agreement.<p>Regarding the humanities/sciences division, I agree that the market is different.  I think, however, that this difference is very accurately modeled by a single factor:  technical literacy.<p>On the whole, I find that the humanities are not interested in the inner workings of computers.  They do not care, and it annoys them greatly to think of such things.  Now consider the fact that open access online journals are started by tech people, which is to say people from the sciences.  Every open-access journal is just too damn complicated for people who don&#x27;t care about social media, or even social logins.  They want (query in) -> (paper out).<p>I think a simple experiment would be very convincing.  Start a journal whose only job is to manage the peer-review process in the most transparent manner possible.  University computing centers can donate storage space to the project.  The now-slim editorial costs can be covered by modest submission fees -- say $100 for any non-3rd world university.<p>I posit that if such a system were to be developed, the humanities would latch on immediately.  In other words, I suspect the humanities want <i>more</i> open-access and unrestrictive licensing, not less, as it&#x27;s actually more convenient for them.<p>In short, I argue that the editorial business is resisting an inevitable market change.<p>Edit:  to end on a more positive note, I&#x27;m sure a business opportunity exists for editors who can make present us with a convenient set of tools to work with this data.",1447181463

Someone who <i>returns</i> items to Amazon so often, that the inconvenience of plugging his laptop into his printer drove him to buy a new printer (from Amazon, one may assume).  Someone who loves Amazon so deeply, that he cannot refrain from praising it---and indeed exonerating it---even as he publicly whines about it.<p>I find these posts interesting because, although the author is a rather extreme example, it seems to me that this love-hate bondage is quite mainstream, not being limited to Amazon or technophiles.  Never mind the first-world indignation at Amazon&#x27;s failure to meet the author&#x27;s admittedly unwarranted expectations.  The emotion driving this is an ethical conflict: my heart is saying go, but my head is saying stay, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Many people (in my estimation) have similarly mixed feelings about Facebook, Apple, and Google, at variously increasing rates.<p>This conflict is born of dependency.  Your negative feelings about something you depend on (pain, shame, frustration, disappointment), strong as they may grow, are never strong enough to overcome your sense of need, along with whatever dopamine hit you get from using it.  Despite being old enough to remember a world without Amazon, the OP takes for granted that <i>someone</i> has to do Amazon&#x27;s job: if not Amazon, then some hard-to-imagine competitor.  But the OP will never leave Amazon---not for another Amazon, anyway.

The sort package and its special function just for sorting strings is practically a written confession.<p>Generics being a speedbump is an argument I haven&#x27;t heard before. Can anyone comment on what the performance challenge is? Nim instantiates unique concrete type instances based on their parameters, couldn&#x27;t Go do the same?",1447180643

10541303,comment,10536833,10537379,0,0,kazinator,,,"I&#x27;ve come up with a function group-reduce which generalizes the construction of hashes from sequences, while streamlining the syntax. The idea is that the hash table entries are accumulators, and we can combine the grouping operation which distributes items into hash keys with reduction over the accumulators. For instance, take the integers 1 through 10, group them into even and odd, and sum the groups:<p><pre><code>  1> [group-reduce (hash) evenp + (range 1 10) 0]\n  #H(() (t 30) (nil 25))\n</code></pre>\nHence, evens add to 30, odds to 25.<p>Now with this, we can obtain a histogram easily, because a left (or right) reduce/fold can count items:<p><pre><code>  2> [reduce-left (do inc @1)\n       &#x27;(brown red green yellow yellow brown brown black) 0]\n  8\n</code></pre>\nThe (do inc @1) gives us (lambda (blah . rest) (inc blah)) which can take two arguments (suitable for reduce) and just returns (+ 1 blah).  We can use this reducer function with group-reduce:<p><pre><code>  3> [group-reduce (hash) identity (do inc @1)\n       &#x27;(brown red green yellow yellow brown brown black) 0]\n  #H(() (black 1) (yellow 2) (green 1) (red 1) (brown 3))\n</code></pre>\ngroup-reduce will be in the next release of TXR (124).<p>I deliberately  made it accept an existing hash so it can be called repeatedly on the same hash to accumulate multiple jobs. That also answers the question of where to specify the hash table attributes.<p>One last detail is that there is an optional argument we are omitting in the group-by call: a filter function which is optionally applied to each element in the table after the accumulation is done. For instance, we can specify this as nreverse, and then we can express group-by using group-reduce.<p>First attempt, oops cons arguments wrong way:<p><pre><code>  1> [group-reduce (hash) evenp cons (range 1 10) nil]\n  #H(() (t (((((nil . 2) . 4) . 6) . 8) . 10)) (nil (((((nil . 1) . 3) . 5) . 7) . 9)))\n</code></pre>\nFix with flipargs. Oops, elements in reverse order:<p><pre><code>  2> [group-reduce (hash) evenp [flipargs cons] (range 1 10) nil]\n  #H(() (t (10 8 6 4 2)) (nil (9 7 5 3 1)))\n</code></pre>\nNow the optional argument kicks in to fix this:<p><pre><code>  3> [group-reduce (hash) evenp [flipargs cons] (range 1 10) nil nreverse]\n  #H(() (t (2 4 6 8 10)) (nil (1 3 5 7 9)))\n</code></pre>\nCompare with group-by:<p><pre><code>  4> [group-by evenp (range 1 10)]\n  #H(() (t (2 4 6 8 10)) (nil (1 3 5 7 9)))</code></pre>",1447180544

This is not something that society is supposed to tolerate; the company doing that should either stop dumping externalities or <i>at least</i> pay everyone else to compensate (taxes are one way of achieving that).<p>I&#x27;m not denying AirBnB/Uber are providing a valuable service to their customers. They do. They provide excellent and inexpensive service. At a cost for everyone else. Hence as I wrote in my original comment, it&#x27;s burning trust to produce dollars.<p>> <i>That&#x27;s just pure speculation. Until we see the language we have no idea what cases it destroys or doesn&#x27;t, or how vaguely worded it is. If there&#x27;s a use that&#x27;s beneficial to both parties, it should be possible to find a party who&#x27;s willing to agree to it in order to receive that benefit, if the market is allowed to operate.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t want to elaborate on that in order to keep the comment relatively short. But it&#x27;s not &quot;just a speculation&quot;, it&#x27;s the obvious consequence of allowing the market to cooperate. If everyone bans AirBnB specifically in the contract, the existence of competition on the market implies that renters will soon have a problem with WaterMattressAndSupper. In order not to turn a contract into ever increasing blacklist, the point will have to be phrased vaguely.<p>> <i>If there is in fact a problem, it should be easy enough to point out the facts of the damage that&#x27;s being done without resorting to calling people names like douchebag and asshole.

Often the affiliate vendors don&#x27;t charge sales tax[1], and sometimes they are a couple of bucks cheaper than the Prime price.  I keep trying to find better deals elsewhere -- Ebay sometimes beats them -- but other vendors really can&#x27;t compete.<p>- <i>Selection</i><p>Selection at Amazon is fabulous.  You can find literally anything there.  Between Amazon and Ebay, they&#x27;ve got you covered for probably any kind of product you could imagine.<p>- <i>User Experience</i><p>Well I haven&#x27;t found it <i>that</i> difficult to do things like sort by price. You have to fast forward past the irrelevant items but many other online retailers have the same problem with false positives and deceptive categorization.  After a while, people just get used to it and learn how to deal with it.<p>- <i>Books</i><p>Amazon began as a book seller, and it remains one of their core competencies.  The Kindle Paperwhite reader is an excellent product (the Fire tablets less so). Amazon has created a first rate ecology for e-books, self-publishers, and of course traditional printed material.<p>- <i>Deals</i><p>I&#x27;m a shopping junkie and I&#x27;m always looking for bargains.  I do online polls and other tasks to acquire Amazon gift cards, so I may not be the typical shopper.  But there are opportunities to knock $5 off here, $10 off there, and really get some deals.  Fill out this poll after the AnDevCon and receive a $20 gift card.  Really?  I&#x27;m all in!  I live for this stuff.<p>- <i>Returns</i><p>If you want the luxury of free returns for non-defective merchandise, then shop locally.  That&#x27;s what retail pricing is for -- to pay for the overhead of 10-20% return rates.  If you can do your research and shop online very carefully, you can avoid the need to return.  If a product is defective, on the other hand, Amazon has first rate service.  Usually just print the label, stick it on the box, and leave it on the porch.  OK, yeah, you probably need to have a roll of packing tape handy, and tape the box closed -- a rather trivial effort in the grand scheme of things.<p>Amazon&#x27;s not perfect, not by a long stretch.  Once in a while, there are better deals elsewhere.  But if you shop realistically, efficiently, and try to accumulate gift cards, you make out like a bandit.<p>[1] Retail sales tax is gradually being extended to online sales.  I respect the law, but I feel that I do not &quot;owe&quot; my state any more money than they already get from me (which is a lot).

A decent non-modular synth is £1000+ (in UK pounds now).  My Nord Lead A1 [1] was around that (and that&#x27;s digital - even if they call it &#x27;virtual analogue&#x27;).  Even second hand analogues can be pretty expensive, I recently purchased a Juno 106 [2] built in 1985 for £700.  A Jupiter 8 will set you back £5000+.<p>It&#x27;s worth it for those that understand the incredible sound you can get from an analogue synth.  Modulars take it that step further where you can get properly involved in creating amazing and crazy sounds and sequences, in a way that&#x27;s difficult or impossible on a regular synth.  Just the hands-on aspect of it can create results that you wouldn&#x27;t do with a mouse and a VST.<p>As good as the digital stuff is, I am yet to hear anything in-the-box that sounds close to quality of an analogue synth.

Go&#x27;s simplicity is initially refreshing, then a huge pain once you find yourself writing the same thing over and over again.<p>A good example is errors being values — which is a great idea. But then you realize every single function needs to be littered 1-10 cases of<p><pre><code>  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an <i>extremely</i> common pattern. It&#x27;s tiring to write, over and over. Tiring to refactor, too: If you change a signature (to add an error, or add another return value, for example), every error check has to be updated.<p>Unfortunately, Go doesn&#x27;t offer any abstractions that might allow you to avoid such boilerplate. Functions that return errors cannot ever be chained, for example: If you have &quot;func bar() (MyStruct, error)&quot;, you cannot do &quot;foo(bar())&quot;. You must always assign the result to an intermediate variable. You could embed the error in the MyStruct struct instead, but that goes against Go&#x27;s grain.<p>I find myself wishing for some magic macro that is smart enough to extract a value and return the error for me. Something like:<p><pre><code>  try! value, err := bar()\n</code></pre>\n...would expand to:<p><pre><code>  value, err := bar()\n  if err != nil {\n    return\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m with you on upper/lower-case names. It results in schizophrenic-looking programs. Unless I&#x27;m writing a library, I tend to just export anything that isn&#x27;t obviously an internal implementation detail, for consistency.<p>I&#x27;m also up in arms about &quot;:=&quot; assignment behaviour. I&#x27;ve run into several bugs caused by shadowing inside blocks. You have to be careful when refactoring so as not to cause shadowing issues; really, editors should have their syntax highlighting set to highlight &quot;:=&quot; in blinking bright yellow or something. It&#x27;s so hard to miss.<p>It&#x27;s also inconsistent with how you (or, at least, I) <i>want</i> it to behave. It will shadow existing variables by default if there is at least one new variable on the left-hand side, but that&#x27;s the <i>least</i> conservative behaviour, and feels contrary to Go&#x27;s strictness — a language, after all, that considers unused imports to be a compilation error. Recently I&#x27;ve started avoiding &quot;:=&quot; in favour of vars, just to avoid falling into that trap by accident.<p>To be fair, I love many aspects of Go: Compilation speed, relative performance, ease of concurrency, static strictness. But after working with Go for a while and being quite productive with it, I&#x27;m at the same time seriously pining for a better language to replace it.",1447179523

The domain expertise accounts for probably 1% to 5% of any business&#x27;s code, and generally it&#x27;s the easiest code to design, test, and change later on because it follows very tightly with well-worn practices in scientific computing. You might invent a great new trading strategy, but implementing it is still just the same old vector math and efficient algorithms stuff everyone&#x27;s been doing for decades.<p>But with the logging, reporting, parameter management, data provenance, data resource management, etc., etc., the actual creative design of the code matters much more, and a failure to make it extensible is way more expensive to fix down the road than tweaking some O(n^2) scientific algorithm.<p>As an aside, this is one reason that I think algorithmic brain teasers are a really stupid thing for interviews or predicting positive business impact. With brainteasers, you are testing for rote memorization of a set of optimization techniques (data structure implementations) that maybe touches 1%-5% of your easiest-to-optimize-from-textbooks-or-wikipedia code, whereas the other 95% can almost always be assumed to rely on library implementations of these kinds of structures, and the high-level design of components, particularly optimizing it so that the addition or refactoring of features later is not expensive, is the dominant concern for adding actual business value.<p>It&#x27;s just another status game like everything else. Programming labor is asserted to be a commodity item to the company, so that managers can justify lower wage, worse working conditions, etc., for programmers than for business domain experts who are supposedly less easily replaced. But the reality is that a reasonably smart programmer can probably pick up the domain expertise to a high level, even to the same level as a Ph.D. researcher, in a short time, whereas for some reason because of some kind of status-based mental block or lack of curiosity, the domain experts seem incapable of picking up legitimate programming skills.<p>When most of the code is for reporting, designing the reporting system is a huge priority.

This is how the Supreme Court tells the NSA that they better clean up their act or the judicial branch will start unilaterally taking away powers they think they have but don&#x27;t.<p>It is also another brick in the wall which shows the government defense of its actions and that Snowden was a traitor (as opposed to a whistle blower) no doubt hinge on the assertion that what the NSA was doing (and was disclosed by Snowden) was <i>legal</i>. That is the bigger conversation that is going on here and so one which Snowden is quite invested.<p>If he ever hopes to return to the US, he has to make an iron clad case that he was a &quot;whistle blower&quot; [1] and not just violating his security clearance. To do that, as I understand it, he needs to prove three things. 1) The activity he was reporting was illegal (as opposed to just something he felt was immoral), 2) that reporting it through channels was likely to be unsuccessful in actually revealing the information, and 3) that was not enriched as a result of his actions.<p>When you try to make that case against the worlds most powerful intelligence agency you cannot do so with simple evidentiary rules. So I see a number of cases and efforts which are putting into the judicial record decisions like this one where the NSA&#x27;s activity is called out as illegal <i>before</i> Snowden steps foot back on US soil and gets arrested for treason.<p>[1] Important note, I&#x27;m not a lawyer, 99% of the whistleblower information is about securities fraud or OSHA safety issues, not constitutional violators.

The author called the programmer into the office, and berated the coding style, citing &quot;efficiency&quot; as a reason for why the program was an example of poor coding style.<p>The main point of the article, was that the junior programmer was right: well structured, self-documenting code is always better than fast code.

My mantra is: data that&#x27;s not backed up doesn&#x27;t exist, and data that&#x27;s not backed up off-site is not backed up. Thanks for providing a great service for cheap.",1447178570

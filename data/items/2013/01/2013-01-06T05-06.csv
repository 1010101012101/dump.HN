In my opinion maybe over-estimated, esp. relative to people like DHH.<p>3) To me - I learned Ruby when Rails was in its infancy and the Agile salesmen had barely just hitched their wagon to it - why represents a more innocent period of the Ruby community.<p>Ruby was really a wonderful place - not-especially talented programmers could explore relatively sophisticated programming language features in a safe sandbox. Everything you'd been doing with Perl or whatever you could do with blocks and lambdas and even call/cc if you didn't mind a huge performance hit (naturally you didn't.)<p>Maybe it's nostalgia, but I think there was a time when MINSWAN actually meant something.

The result is that my recalling after 24 hours is close to 80-90% for new words, which is encouraging.<p>I've been doing this for ~1 week, so take it with a grain of salt, but for me it seems that visualizing the words <i>and</i> using SR is helping.

I do online banking all the time. It is possible to code something secure and tight, but I'll admit it's not easy. I think security will always be an issue, even with native apps.<p><i>Local Data - Storage is limited & it can be manipulated</i><p>- True, storage needs to be unlimited. As for manipulating it, this is also true of native apps. Without jailbreaking, I can manipulate a save file for almost any iPhone game. The security issue (again) depends on the developer, and how they protect the data.<p><i>Syncing offline apps - Determining which is the latest version etc</i><p>- Yup, that's a challenge too. But also a challenge native apps face. When I make a note on an offline iPhone in the notes app, and then edit the same note on my Mac, it creates a duplicate when the iPhone is back online.

I like to sympathise with sensitive people - I think Tolkien was clearly a very sensitive, quiet, private man, and Christopher similarly. I don't think Tolkien ever imagined his work becoming as popular and mass-culture as it did. He took it so seriously I think it would have shocked him. And from the way this article describes it, Tolkien's work formed the bedrock of a very sensitive, private, tender father-son relationship - and that bedrock is now being smeared around every cinema and toystore in the world. Rightly or wrongly, that must hurt a lot for Christopher.<p>Perhaps nothing should be allowed to remain private. Perhaps privacy is an affront to the rights of the people. But I don't think so. I think everyone has special, private things from their lives - special things they would be upset to see appropriated and distorted at will by other people with little to no understanding or reverence for the meaning those things hold to you. Christopher is only different because the things that made his childhood special and to which he feels protective have become an unstoppable blockbuster film series.<p>Hell, I can sympathise. Maybe it's just snobbery, but damned if I don't feel disgusted by the shameless, opportunistic faux-Tolkienism whipped up by by New Zealanders in the wake of the films. Nobody in New Zealand gave a shit about Tolkien before the movies. It was only when people realised that it was going to be huge that suddenly everyone became a lifelong Tolkien fan and every farmer next to a film site was running a Hobbit tour... You know, my grandpa read The Hobbit to me when I was young, and he even has a photo from when he met Tolkien (before the books took off.)<p>Edit: On another note, I think it's a bit rich for Hackernews readers to criticise Christopher for snobbery/possessiveness - after all, the whole bloody point of Hackernews is to discourage average internet users, prevent that 'Eternal September' thing - and maintain a conversation to an elite-defined standard.

5015371,comment,5015119,5015119,3,0,kafkaesque,,,"I agree that it depends on the community. It's not science related, but I recently moved to Los Angeles and started using Yelp. The LA Yelp Talk forums are filled with the most horrific comments and interactions I've ever seen. I was so taken aback that I went to my hometown's Yelp Talk to see if all of it was like that, and the difference was night and day. In fact, my hometown's Yelp Talk forum talked about what frightening and unbelievably rude people participated in Yelp Talk LA. This particular community has no sense of netiquette and it is basically a free-for-all. In my experience, it is interesting how this is very indicative of the popular/mainstream culture in Los Angeles, as well.",1357448838

Even if this is playing fast and loose with the requirements, it would work out fine, and you would almost certainly get a good grade if you explain why you did it.",1357448833

Going from 7 to 14 developers will add a huge amount of communication overhead and give a slew of new problems.",1357448812

I usually solve the problems in my head or on paper before doing any coding.There is usually a step afterwards during which I translate this solution into a given programming language. This step in Java is much harder than I would like.<p>The reason for this is that I feel I spend too much time doing taxonomy and managing complex relationships between different classes when programming in Java. This occurs in every programming language but I find Java is by far the most restrictive in this regard. I find go much more flexible, as much as python, and scheme even more so.<p>The end result is that I am more productive when programming in these languages and most importantly I feel that I am not doing as much busywork. This in turns makes programming more fun and rewarding.",1357448612

They have too many support types: lawyers, designers, business, public relations, etc. I think they'd have needed to have teams be 7-10 to fit that many types into a startup. Which is too many for a startup... so I think that retrying without the deadweight of support roles might help (not that lawyers/designers/business/public relations people arn't great, but its hard to perform their roles before there is a product in existance).",1184027862

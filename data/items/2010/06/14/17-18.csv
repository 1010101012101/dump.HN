Each of those take an incredible amount of investment; the number of Grammy winners who write bestsellers, break olympic records, fly planes, and are expert engineers is... zero, as far as I know.<p>But then I realized you don't have to achieve any of those to achieve a lot. If you try for #1 and fail, you've still made amazing music. If you try for #2 and fail, you're still keeping yourself in excellent physical shape. Try for #6 and fail, and you've still experienced some of the cultural richness of our world.<p>You might never achieve a single item on this list—but you'd be looking at a very fulfilling life in the pursuit of it.",1276538385

1430403,comment,1429483,1430312,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I'm not sure it's necessarily more effective.  Perhaps it's less sinister sounding.  The problem with ecological niches as a mindset, is that some ecological niches are quite small.<p>Then again, perhaps it's a useful metaphor, in that ecological niches are not static.  In the case of social news/networks, sites often started out quite small, then changed their ecological niche over time.  In fact, one can argue that reddit.com, Digg, MySpace, Facebook all shifted in this way.<p>The pattern I see here, is that the ecological niche viewpoint is more strategic, whereas the predator/prey viewpoint is more tactical.  When one is planning a site's entry into a certain market, one can choose a small niche that can be strategically grown into a larger one.  When one is executing on that entry, look for a place where your understanding of the value proposition is better than those on the other side of your transaction.

You may view the war in Afghanistan as an exercise in corruption by the military-industrial complex, but it is also a valid application of the theory of forward defense to directly engage these extremists on their own territory and force them to consume their limited resources on self defense instead of using them aggressively.  If a deal could be reached with the Taliban that would, with certainty, end their alliance with extremists and the export of violence to the tribal regions of Pakistan and the rest of the world, then that deal would be enthusiastically embraced just as it has been with the Saudis, but such a deal seems unlikely given the current state of the Taliban's ideology and certain ingrained Afghan cultural traits.",1276538244

Start doing it."" is really amazing advice.<p>I think that you too often confuse means with ends, and don't attack the ends directly; instead, your waylaid by the means. For example: you want to make money with this spreadsheet scheme, but then you want to put it into the startup. Fuck, no. Work directly on your startup.<p>Also, stop listening to rap music. All rapper love to rap about their money, but it's a stupid pyramid scheme because they only get money from selling music (or drugs). I spent so much time smoking weed and listening to Lil Wayne in college, thinking that because I'm so smart I'm definitely going to make so much money. No, he's selling you the fantasy. When we get caught up in idol worship, we spend time admiring the successful. Successful people are too busy doing whatever makes them successful to waste time like that.<p>If you want to be a successful man, you have to start aligning yourself with <i>Reality</i> instead of <i>Fantasy</i>.

(This is in fact where the ""borrow"" on a stock may come from - that same brokerage may be lending shares from that pool to people who want to short a stock - generally you can tell the brokerage not to lend your shares out to those shorting.)<p>The classic short squeeze example, by the way, is the recent Porsche / VW short squeeze where Porsche essentially screwed shorts by buying up so much of VW that there was only 6% of stock left in ""float"" while there was 12.1% of the company on loan to shorts. All of a sudden there were 2 shares of shorted stock for every 1 not owned by Porsche, and they could pretty much dictate whatever price they wanted to shorts desperate to close out their positions.

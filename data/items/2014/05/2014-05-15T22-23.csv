If I can copy your invention without any effort just by looking at it... is it even worth to grant the patent?<p>Patents are a means to encourage companies to share trade secrets, not a tool to turn them into monopolies. If your trade secret is not secret, why would the people (remember the governments, i.e. the people, are the ones granting patents) grant you any privilege so you would disclose what is already public and/or obvious?<p>OTOH, it&#x27;s in the people&#x27;s interests that Lift Labs share their data (which algorithms they tried, their performance, etc.) so a patent makes sense in this case.

If last-mile ISPs can start charging Terrifs for use of their lines (like the telcos do), this will have the opposite of the desired effect on pricing and will lead to arbitrage like we&#x27;ve seen with the Telcos (these Terrifs allowed NetZero to make money by keeping your modem connected... essentially billing everyone in the country through the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Federal Universal Service Charge&quot; on your phone bill instead of their users).

Small start-ups have always payed more per Megabit. That&#x27;s the free market at work. You pay less for bulk. It makes sense. Every content provider (website, video service, shared host, VoIP provider, etc) has always been able to pay for priority at some level (be it through exclusive private fiber channels, faster DNS, the use of CDNs, or even QoS for latency-critical services like VoIP & gaming). This has generally been a good thing. Yes, some local monopolistic ISPs are acting up and something has to be done about that.

A browser with fewer users results in less influence for its creator and users, obviously.<p>Phoenix, Firebird and Firefox before version 4 were generally excellent releases. This was back when Mozilla innovated and put out offerings that benefited users. These versions truly made people better off, and much of Firefox&#x27;s rapid adoption was due to direct word-of-mouth recommendation.<p>Then around Firefox 4, they decided to imitate Chrome, rather than leading the way. The release schedule changes caused broken add-ons for a very long time. This drove people away. They&#x27;ve also repeatedly made harmful UI changes, to the point where Firefox today is almost visually identical to Chrome. This has driven more people away. Meanwhile, there has only been minimal progress when it comes to improving the performance of Firefox, and reducing its memory usage. This, too, has driven more people away to browsers that manage to perform better, with fewer resources. (Spare us the are-we-fast-yet-style benchmarks that just don&#x27;t seem to match the actual browsing experience.)<p>Nobody but Mozilla themselves made Mozilla act in such a manner.

This is why FOSS encoders and decoders for it can freely exist without any issues (and the FOSS x264 encoder also happens to be pretty much the best H.264 encoder in the world too). The complications arise from the fact that a lot of tech used in H.264 is patented (software) and licensing of said patents is required in many cases to make use of it. But all in all, H.264 is still quite compatible with FOSS (and would be perfectly compatible if software patents didn&#x27;t exist), whereas DRM is <i>completely incompatible</i> due to its secret nature.

Its cost is listed at $295.00[1] and this is their only product.  It&#x27;s huge compared to what the best facilities and teams in the world can produce to the same specifications, relatively unaesthetic as a utensil in its present form as compared to what a better-funded team can produce in a matter of weeks, and is clearly first-generation. They have no brand in the medical space.  It is an eating utensil, yet it is not waterproof.<p>It is, however, patented.[2]  This single fact allows this company (in its present form) to exist, to have done its research, to have raised its investment, and to bring their prototype in the form we currently see to market, at the price that it is currently listed at.<p>But patents are &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;stifle innovation&quot;.<p>Granted it&#x27;s pretty obvious that this makes a huge difference in people&#x27;s lives.  So perhaps we should leaven our desire that their margin disappear, with hoping that more teams are somehow magically and irrationally in a position to do the world&#x27;s R&D before losing their shirts as their margins disappear from under them.  Having seen the size of this thing, the fact that it&#x27;s not waterproof, the lack of an existing trusted brand-name behind the product, and a lack of any distribution except their web site (see their FAQ) shows that there is no way that is the best that any team in the world can build now that they&#x27;ve seen how it&#x27;s done. Therefore, lacking protection, this team would no longer be competitive in a short number of weeks/months.<p>We can, however, agree that it is good that this has been made.  So, how shall we reconcile this?  Well, perhaps we should simply hope that funding, such as they have raised, would magically continue to be available even without any any margins that are guaranteed in the results (should they succeed in embodying their claims), which would allow the investors to recoup their investment.  In short, we need investors to be crazy enough to keep funding innovations such as this one, while we remove the protections that would justify that craziness.  Basically, we would have to hope that investors never catch on.<p>This is crucial for our purposes, as otherwise ideas such as this would not exist.  Someone could have had this idea in 1999 or 1989.  But without the investment, it might have stayed at the &quot;worth-nothing&quot; idea stage, rather than what we might call the &quot;worth-nothing-but-has-now-actually-beend-developed-and-actually-been-built-and-proven-and-it&#x27;s-no-longer-a-pipe-dream&quot; worth-nothing stage.  Which the rest of us deserve to access for free without investing anything.<p>There is an analogy to be made here with Tesla, who died nearly penniless: his meager earnings had come from his patent royalties.  Imagine if we had the ability to rewrite history and take even this away from him, along with the food from his stomach and equipment from his labs, so that Edison and the rest of the world&#x27;s teams would have full access to all of his inventions, working or impractical, without any protection.  Imagine what progress that would have led to.<p>In summary:<p>1- ideas like this deserve no patent protection<p>2- teams should prove incredibly speculative techniques such as this for free and with no compensation or protection<p>3- investors should continue to invest in such ideas forever, even after it becomes abundantly clear that there is no way to recoup the investment in such a fledgling idea.;<p></sarcasm><p>Just kidding!!  Phew.  I hope we can all agree how ridiculous the above position would be.  It&#x27;s great that these guys brought their patented, high-margin product to the world.  All this <i>could</i> have been done in 1984 - 40 years ago - if someone had had the &#x27;wortheless&#x27; idea then -- and we would all have access to it today.<p>It took a team&#x27;s phenomenal genius and dedication today to bring this to market, and the whole world will have it soon - unlike any of the Idea Sunday ideas that have no such protection, were never fully developed, and for which the entire program was crapped.<p>Here&#x27;s to sane patents and to the progress they bring!<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.liftlabsdesign.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.liftlabsdesign.com/</a> $ 295.00.  Note that my estimated margin at this price: (for copycat) 98.64% margins - ex assumed &quot;worthless&quot; idea - assuming a COGS at scale of $4, which is enough for several batteries, gyroscopes, microchips, cases, what have you.  If we assume a $20 cost of goods that margin shrinks to 93.22% gross profit, again excluding the idea (which we assume is &quot;worthless&quot;) or its development (which we assume the world should have access to for free, now that they&#x27;ve proven it.)<p>[2] \n<a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/smart-spoon-helps-stabilize-parkinsons-tremors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/smart-spoon-helps-stabilize-parkins...</a>",1400193272

Non-DRM offerings like gog.com, independent artists etc. are fine and should be paid for if used<p>What else?  The root of the problem seems to be that major media companies are demanding DRM.  For most of media that most people want to consume, there are no DRM-free alternatives, except pirating, which does carry some risks.  It&#x27;s hard to recommend pirating as a solution to the average media consumer, since the legal consequences <i>can</i> be bankrupting, and avoiding those risks (&quot;just set up an anonymous VPN for your torrents!&quot;) requires technical know-how that most don&#x27;t have.<p>I think we need more thought about the following:<p>1. How can we convince the producers of popular media to release it without DRM?  Many will say it can&#x27;t happen without a serious change in the structure of the media business; but there might be some room for solutions here, like Mozilla&#x27;s &quot;watermarking&quot; idea, that give these companies most of what they&#x27;re looking for (more control over distribution and remedies for infringement) without making the copies of this media basically unusable from a consumer&#x27;s perspective.  Legal remedies were enough for these companies before the rise of digital media and the Internet; could publishers be convinced to abandon DRM if a better legal framework for distribution and infringement was available?<p>2. How can we get people to like, and pay for, media that is produced and released without DRM by independent publishers?  As others have pointed out, these publishers generally already know that DRM is not in their interest.  But they have two problems: it&#x27;s hard for people to find their stuff, and they don&#x27;t have the capital to compete with large media companies on production value.  What can be done to lower the barriers here?  New tools that make indexing and searching for DRM-free media easy for consumers?  New tools that make producing and marketing high-quality media easy for publishers?  What should those look like?",1400191773

7752534,comment,7750844,7752222,1,0,walden42,,,"> On sites like reddit and FB, it costs the content providers effectively nothing to manipulate votes.<p>But that&#x27;s offset by the sheer volume of people who can freely vote. If you have a system where a vote is a payment, you&#x27;ll likely have a >95% reduction of legitimate voters, and likely a much higher amount of &quot;gamed&quot; voters as a result. Remember, corporations and governments have more money to spend than the average person. I.e. All governments/corporations can afford to spend money + some individuals can spend money. Compare that with: All governments/corporations can freely upvote + all individuals can freely upvote. Requiring money actually skews voting in the wrong direction.<p>That&#x27;s why I think Reddit made a smart decision when they implemented Reddit guilding for top-level comments. They did it in such a way that guilding doesn&#x27;t affect voting, and guilded comments can&#x27;t even be seen from the homepage--otherwise it would skew the results.<p>I do totally agree about other ways to support creators, though. I think it&#x27;s crucial for sites like StackOverflow to implement direct tipping for users&#x27; efforts.",1400191593

The ones that aren&#x27;t are largely owned by AT&T, which complains very loudly that it is required to sell access to anyone who wants it at a price dictated by the Federal Communications Commission nationwide.<p>Meanwhile California (get this) opted out of much of the FCC regulation around utility poles and effectively allows a large private company to own and control the poles.  This private company is made up of all the usual suspects like AT&T, Sprint, PG&E, T-Mobile, Verizon, etc., who seem to have formed a holding company to buy utility poles without anyone at the state being concerned about antitrust concerns.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the requirements are to join--if access is &quot;open&quot; (for some definition of open) this may be how they circumvent the Sherman Antitrust Act etc.<p>California did pass &quot;fair access&quot; laws in 2011 [1] but as far as I can tell they only apply to &quot;local publicly owned electric utilities&quot; which presumably would not include AT&T and its utility pole holding company.  There probably is some kind of regulation that in principle regulates competitive access to poles but how it compares to the FCC&#x27;s jurisdiction in Texas it is difficult to say.<p>This is a side note, but we should really be having less talk about how we <i>think</i> regulation works and more case studies about how it does or doesn&#x27;t work in these comment threads.  &quot;Less regulation == better internet&quot; is a plausible model but so was the Bohr Model of the atom.  &quot;Is it correct?&quot; is the question and that question can only be answered by looking at empirically what happens.<p>[1] <a href=""http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xht...</a>",1400191544

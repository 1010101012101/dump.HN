#little bit like ""intelligent design"", 
#when it talks of ""programming"" humans.<p>Well, I am really disappointed that the article sounds like ""intelligent design."" That may be due to my inarticulateness. I have no intention of advocating ""intelligent design.""<p>I am just curious to know if there is an academic or scholarly field where people study programming outside of computers, more specifically, programming humans.<p>#In a sense, natural selection programs all 
#organisms by allowing only the fit variations 
#in a given generation to survive, promulgating 
#the ""fit genes"" forward, but ""design"" or ""program"" 
#are terms in this context to be used metaphorically.<p>But it seems to me that ""natural selection"" is a term that needs to be used metaphorically as well.<p>In the article, the Prometheus story is not metaphorical. It is a real story written by a real person. I am trying to understand if humans reading the Prometheus story can be considred to be programmed in analogy to computer programming.<p>So when I read a Sunday paper supplement about discounted items and I go buy one, am I being programmed? What is the scholarly field that studies such programming?",1224964028
343748,comment,343594,343729,0,0,utx00,,,"sure. but i only put forward the 'expand your intuition"" argument as a rebuttal to your ""models of understanding"".  i am saying though that the very same concepts that gave rise to lisp, also make it more powerful in practice. ""in the field"" as they say.  but it takes a little practice to get there.<p>yes, lisp won't ever be more popular. just like ""30 Rock"" won't ever be more popular than ""the office""",1224963998
343747,comment,343594,343710,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I never found this objects first idea very plausible. It's just OO dogma, not cognitive science. Which of the following expressions is most ""natural"" in your view?<p>person.buy(house, agency, contract)<p>agency.sell(house, contract, person)<p>house.sale(person, agency, contract)<p>contract.fulfil(house, person, agency)<p>Of course the decision is not taken based on what's easiest to explain to non computer users but rather on which object's encapsulated data is most affected by the operation, or which inheritance hierarchy should be used to look up the operation. In most non trivial cases that's extremely subjective. Being forced to make that decision _every time_ you call or write a function is a complete waste of intellectual effort.<p>Since there is always one name for what should happen (the name of the function) but potentially many objects that are involved in some capacity, it seems much more consistent to give a special syntactical place to the function rather than to any of the objects:<p>sell(house, person, contract) or if you prefer (sell house person contract)",1224963933
343745,comment,343594,343738,0,0,markessien,,,"Yes, you use the power of lisp to solve your own problem, and that's good. And I absolutely agree with you that lisp is an excellent languages for solving problems.<p>But it does not change the fact that lisp is not easily accessible for most people, and that particular limitation of lisp is why it will not be 'the next big thing'.<p>On a personal note, I don't think that using DSLs is good programming practise. It is my opinion that this makes your code too specific to you and you force anyone trying to understand your code to first learn a new language - the one you just invented.<p>It's like comparing Seth Godins writing to the writings of Kant. There was a time when I was in philosophical mood and I bought the original German version of a book by Kant. Kant is often described as one of the great thinkers, but he sure is not one of the great writers. His sentences are long and unwieldy and it's very difficult to understand what he's trying to say. Seth Godin writes plainly, however, and he communicates his ideas clearly.<p>The core purpose of reading both their writings is to gain in knowledge, and when the sentence structure of one writing is so obscure that one can't even parse the sentence, then this purpose is not being achieved.<p>Writing a DSL is the same thing - if nobody else understands what you wrote, then, though you may have succeeded in communicating your meaning to the computer, you have failed in communicating to anybody else who may want to improve your code. And that second part of things is also an important part of programming.",1224963771

343738,comment,343594,343723,0,0,utx00,,,"yes, but you have the ability to tailor the language and create constructs to deal with your problems more concisely.<p>i learned lisp before C. i always found C to be very obtuse and arbitrary.  for example:<p>1. why can't i define a function inside a function and then return it, why can't i define a function based on some conditional?<p>2. macros that are just text expansions are useless (well not useless but in comparison to lisp macros!)<p>3. no way to embed a mini language. or way, but too difficult. in lisp you don't even have to think about it. (a little query language, or a little configuration language, or a language to do gene annotations based on certain protein sequences that non-computer people can write in :)<p>4. you have to compile and use a debugger. in lisp you can change and run things as you write them.<p>5. recursion is unequivocally expensive.<p>6. can't write new iteration constructs (or you can by passing function pointers but it's limited and ugly)<p>7. no anonymous functions! c'mon!<p>etc etc<p>so the fact that lisp doesn't map into a preconceived model of understanding has very little practical significance ...  C, by all measures, is less powerful and wouldn't allow me to do my work with reasonable amount of effort. neither would python btw.  as i maintain a domain specific language that would have been very difficult to write in some other language.",1224962706

I also have a theory that with the world becoming more and more related with media being more and more similar across countries, your neighbors are suddenly all the celebrities and people on TV.<p>And we know that you value your worth relatively to what your neighbors have. So with your neighbors suddenly being much better off due to them being celebrities, you end up feeling poorer and must play the consumerism game.<p>I'll try to rewrite this to make more sense later - pretty tired now.",1224962448
343733,comment,342920,343492,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> fundamental flaws of capitalism -- the tendency for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer<p>BS.  Riches to shirtsleeves abound.  Wealth rarely lasts three generations.  Now, there are certain subgroups that seem mired in poverty, but that's another matter.  The extent to which the rich have been getting richer and the poor getting poorer for the last 30 years in America has everything to do with the explosive growth of government and regulation, NOT capitalism.<p>Capital gains should be zero.  All wealth creation is driven by savings and capital.  Maximized capital investment and the incentives to save, maximize growth.<p>Income taxes should also be zero, by the way.

343724,comment,343571,343571,0,0,lacker,,,"I predict that Paul will end up abandoning Arc and restarting his quest for the perfect programming language anew. It seems to happen with other successful languages - Python wasn't Guido's first attempt at a programming language, and Ruby wasn't Matz's first attempt at a language. It's hard to change fundamentals once you have already publicized a language and you have working code, and I think some of the fundamentals of Arc will definitely need to be changed. In particular, the distinctions between the different types of iterable objects - strings, arrays, lists - the inability to design your own objects that are also usable in the same ways as the built-in objects, these are pretty key aspects of the more recent programming languages. I could easily be wrong, but I still suspect the 100-year language quest needs a reboot.<p>Good luck, and I'll keep trying Arc 3 or whatever future stuff there is.

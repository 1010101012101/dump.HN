It's not going out of business"" back when it was selling at $0.50/share in 2002.  I'm satisfied with my 10-bagger (I missed both the trough and the peak and didn't sell all my shares), but if I'd put my life savings of about $15K in in 2002, and sold at the peak in 2007, I would have made $1.8M.",1227369213

My application area is in text processing and topic models for legal document analysis. Wavelet transforms or statistical modeling in the wavelet domain seems like the kind of thing that would have been tried many times over in finance.  Do you know of any instances when it turns out to be useful useful for time series?",1227369166

372982,comment,372573,372765,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Maybe it was just my school. I figured Stanford and other top schools would be different.<p>Dunno about Stanford, but it's basically like that at Amherst, except for a small group of students (perhaps 10% of the student body).<p>A friend (former cofounder :-) and I were talking about how even though Amherst is the #1 liberal arts college in the country, there were an awful lot of dumb people in his classes.  He's found that people were way smarter at his employer (a boutique management consulting firm) and now at HBS.<p>I had the opposite impression - I thought people were crazy smart at Amherst, and then more average, though still smart, at my employer (a financial software startup).  But that was because I was in physics/CS, while he was in econ/psych.  I get the feeling that many universities have internal hierarchies, where people in quantitative fields are often more driven than people in the liberal arts.",1227368861
372981,comment,372922,372922,0,0,mdasen,,,"I feel like editors/directors are what got Yahoo into this position in the first place.  Rather than focusing on technology, they assumed that the internet would be like traditional media - something hard for new players to break into, something where you could tell the viewers what they wanted to see, etc.<p>That hasn't proven to be the case.  Yahoo and AOL focused on pushing content they thought was important to users.<p><pre><code>  Yahoo & AOL: Oh, you're logging into webmail, you probably want to hear about Britney Spears' new baby first.
  Me: No, I really don't.
  Yahoo & AOL: Well, we'll show you that story because everyone likes gossip in their mail.
  Me: I don't.
  Yahoo & AOL: Well, you're wrong.  Our research tells us what you want, not you.
</code></pre>
Google took the opposite approach - give people what they ask for.  Don't try to give them something unless they ask for it.  Maybe subtly suggest - like the webclips in Gmail - but make it so the user can tell you what to put there and can eliminate it if unwanted.  Then, focus on the technology that lets users get what they want rather than hiring ""experts"" that can tell you what people as a whole ""want"".<p>In the old world (newspapers, television, radio), it was important to figure out what people as a whole wanted.  There was limited capacity and so only a few of the billions of possibilities could reach an individual.  The internet is different.  For practical purposes, the permutations are infinite.  As such, the problem is letting a user find what they want rather than experts selecting what everyone will average to.<p>Yes, it would be nice if Yahoo's services formed a cohesive direction as the article suggests.  However, that's not Yahoo's big problem.  Yahoo's problem is thinking that no matter where I go, I want to hear about the sexiest celebrities or what Palin is doing or about the hollywood SAG or about the Knicks. . .  Let me tell you what I want and then get it for me!  Wait, I did tell you what I wanted!  I wanted my mail!  So, why are you getting me ""news"" when I asked for mail?!?!",1227368595

372978,comment,372274,372793,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"PCA is an incredibly useful technique.  At work we've been using it to model the structure of the yield curve, i.e. the graph of interest rates vs. maturity.  Turns out you can decompose most daily movements of the yield curve into three components: parallel shift up/down, steepening/flattening, and a ""bow"" where 2s5s flattens, 5s10s steepens, and 10s30s flattens..  It would be interesting to build an interest rate model that evolves these three components forward in time... it would probably be most useful for short time scales where the principal components are unlikely to change.",1227368056

Now I uncomment a line to my /etc/hosts file that points news.yc to another IP. It works a lot better because if I go to news.yc while the IP is redirected, my browser caches the IP and I can't access the site, so I have to remember to unblock it before I try to access it. This forces me to think about what I'm doing.",1227367530

372963,comment,372593,372593,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"How about something where users could sign up to have the site 'off' for them during hours that you (pg) specify?  That way we couldn't adjust the time and cheat ourselves, or lift a self-imposed block just because we have 5 free minutes before lunch.  Also - it would be good if the decision to sign up to have the site down for those users was irrevocable for at least the first couple of weeks.<p>I understand this is scope creep to your original idea - but it might be fun.  And it could be a historic precedent - the first feature added to a site which would block user's access to that site.",1227366024

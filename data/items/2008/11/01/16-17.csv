350764,comment,350159,350469,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"Berkeley DB is very much the same idea as couchdb, a persistent hash. What's interesting about couchdb is the REST API that makes use of JSON and the use of Erlang/OTP. Erlang was built by and for telecom apps. It's robustness and scalability are phenomenal.<p>Couchdb also includes a map/reduce framework based on javascript. It's really worth a close look. The one thing I don't quite get is why they haven't used Mnesia instead of rolling their own storage model. Perhaps because it wasn't designed for very large datasets.",1225556287

Presumably BI would be, at least to start, roughly the bare minimum required to survive.  Any luxuries would still require earned income.<p>Also, given hedonic adaptation, humans are rarely content with any given level of luxury.  While there are certainly negatives to that, it does mean that most (or at least many) people would continue to attempt to earn as much as possible even with a basic income.<p>Finally, the money does have to come from somewhere.  I expect that the system would be designed so that it begins net neutral for the middle class.

Maybe if x% (95? 100?) of your last y comments (100? 500?) have been approved it could give you the benefit of the doubt?<p>Would it be worth offering users with 1000+ karma the ability to disable their abilities so they could enjoy the filtered version others see? Or would too many people chose the option making it not work at all?<p>Finally, I lost my flagging rights ages ago, presumably for using it too liberally - is there any system in place whereby that might reverse?

7446282,comment,7445761,7445761,19,0,yajoe,,,"This is an interesting feature, and certainly not something I would have expected as the &quot;next&quot; feature to add.  When I read &quot;pending comments&quot; I expected something similar to slashdot&#x27;s old &quot;preview&quot; feature so one could double-check spelling, formatting, etc. i.e. preview the post before submitting to HN.  I would not have expected &quot;pending&quot; to mean &quot;pending <i>moderation</i>&quot; given the successful voting feature here.<p>I would ask what the goals of the change are, but they seem obvious:<p>1) Limit nastiness and negativity<p>2) Encourage deeper and pensive comments<p>3) Cynically, it seems like a private goal would be to limit criticism of YC, though I know this would never be a <i>stated</i> goal.  The criticism may simply have increased the priority even though HN has seemed more civil in recent months as an outside observer.<p>While the change may achieve these results, I would expect the following effects:<p>1) Fewer comments overall (there is a new &quot;tax&quot; to post, so-to-speak) and as a result there will be fewer visitors in the medium term (sites like HN, reddit, slashdot, huff post, etc all thrive on both the quality _and_ quantity of comments since that&#x27;s what entertains people).  Without controlling the number of front-page stories, you will in effect decrease the available content for viewers to consume.  The demand will be filled elsewhere.  I always assumed there was a private, invite-only forum for YC and that you would leave HN alone as a great PR platform... this move makes me wonder some more.<p>2) Comments will trend towards the quality of bane, tokenadult, ChuckMcM, patio11, cperciva, etc (we all know them) at the risk of fewer &quot;provocative&quot; posts.  Often the greatest quality posts, however, are in response or to contradict simple-minded or provocative posts.<p>3) I am concerned by this line: <i>People who regularly endorse comments that fail one or both of these tests will lose the ability to endorse comments.</i>  I like meta-moderation and all, but I don&#x27;t like being reminded that all actions are recorded and tied back to my account.  I would ask for some separation between &quot;endorsing&quot; and &quot;agreeing&quot; -- as a continual skeptic, I like reading and promoting contrarian views since it helps us learn.<p>I look forward to watching the experiment, and as a parting request, would you be able to record and measure the goals?  There must be a YC company that can help with that, and I imagine it would be a wonderful blog write-up!",1395449674

Would appreciate to hear the thoughts of those with experience in this area.<p>My gut feeling is that, although users may have signed T&Cs allowing this, UK/EU courts would hold that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy around the mailbox, and so the Regulation Of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) would apply [2]. This means that such a host couldn&#x27;t go digging themselves into the email.<p>However, a potential route in could be via getting the source to make a subject access request under the Data Protection Act 2000 (DPA) into the organisation, supplying their external email address, in response to which there would be a very tenuous grounds to release the mail. However:\n1. I&#x27;m fairly sure that this would be considered a misreading of the DPA, and hosted mail would be considered information held by the client, rather than the host\n2. There&#x27;s such an obvious claim here that all of this would have happened under duress, and that&#x27;s a huge can of worms....<p>So in conclusion, I suspect the only way to legally get at such an email within the UK/EU would be via working with law enforcement, or via one of the two parties to the discussion providing it.<p>[1] Most of the relevant acts of UK law are descended from common EU legislation, and apply broadly across the EU, hence the repeated use of UK/EU here<p>[2] Unless you&#x27;re working in certain very strict offices with clear Security Operating Procedures (SyOPS) and regular training, UK/EU courts are likely rule that even corporate email systems can be considered to hold personal communications protected under RIPA",1395448907

Multiple (<1000 karma) people will post very similar response to a question, or other objective comment, since they would not be aware of other pending comments on that thread. This would lead to...<p>2a. Either moderators endorsing multiple such comments, due to race conditions and stale views during moderation, or<p>2b. Moderators would endorse the first (or &quot;best&quot;) of them, and many people with reasonable comments will be in limbo in the rest of HN, for the fault of writing a similar response to another endorsed poster.<p>3. (NEW) If a user has something meaningful to say to two different posts, he/she is now more likely to choose the one with more activity since he can&#x27;t post on both anymore, and he/she wouldn&#x27;t want to wait for the moderators to see the less active post. As a result, the power law distribution on post activity is going to become even more prominent than before.<p>I would recommend the following changes:<p>1. Apply this policy on a per-page basis, rather than on a global HN basis.<p>2. Allow 2 or 3 pending comments per person, rather than 1. Anyone who needs more than that, and is not getting endorsed at all, is probably trolling or spamming, and can be dealt with other means.<p>3.

Precisely because society is so fluid, the question of what is &quot;true&quot; not only does not have a clear answer, but the &quot;truth&quot; itself carries little value. Things might be true today but not tomorrow not only due to changing fashions, but they might be objectively true only because of circumstances that are in our control. Suppose Asians really are smarter than Caucasians. Not only is this &quot;truth&quot; unhelpful, it is also, possibly, fluid.<p>The reason why people often choose to condemn those who speak an unpopular truth is because the truth is a powerful and dangerous weapon, <i>often used to fight progress</i>. This is what is known as the naturalistic fallacy, or the is-ought fallacy: the fact that something is true does not mean that it is good, or that it cannot change if we try hard enough. A &quot;lie&quot; might be more valuable than the &quot;truth&quot;, because a lie might be a bright hope for the future, while the truth is simply the status quo.<p>For some reason, even people that are usually curious and generally skeptical, sometimes stop questioning society when they find data demonstrating that some notion is &quot;true&quot;. They don&#x27;t take the extra step to ask why is it true, and can we change it? Or, should we change it?<p>That is why the &quot;truth&quot; in the social sciences might be a dangerous thing, because if people come to assign the same meaning to a true finding in physics or in anthropology, we have a problem.

7445939,comment,7443851,7444654,5,0,_Robbie,,,"I have long been interested in these issues. The overarching issue is that labor is becoming less valuable in relation to capital. This is evidenced by increasing productivity but stagnant wages, a decrease in labor&#x27;s share of GDP, and an increase in corporate profits share of GDP.<p>The simplest solutions are to redistribute wealth such as through a basic income or a negative income tax. These programs can be viewed as fixing capitalism, and are not necessarily socialist. Unfortunately, most of these redistribution programs will need to be implemented by governments.<p>As an alternative to governmental redistribution, I have thought about an e-currency with a time based demurrage (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)</a>) fee. The demurrage fees would be paid out equally to all consumers. The demurrage fee plays the same role as a job in the current economy by circulating currency from producers to consumers. Since it is an e-currency, it would be independent of governments. The good news is that if in the future wealth inequality causes economic output to shrink, businesses might be forced to accept these types of currencies in order to grow.",1395447064

This is an idea I had a few months ago, threw around in my head, and realized it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d never have time to build.<p>I&#x27;m thrilled that you have!<p>For those of you who aren&#x27;t super-familiar with the agonizing process of choosing the proper bike, I&#x27;ll try to clue you in.<p>Say you wanted to buy a Full-suspension 29&#x27;er from a well-known manufacturer for about $2,900.  You&#x27;d narrowed your choices down to the Giant Anthem X 29er, Trek Fuel EX 8 29er and Specialized Stumpjumper FSR Comp 29er.<p>At this point, if you wanted to know which option gave you the best value in terms of components, you&#x27;d have to obsessively comb over the manufacturer&#x27;s sites, and (if you&#x27;re like me) possibly build your own spreadsheet that listed every &quot;important&quot; component from the bikes you were considering.<p>Now, you can just go to <a href=""http://bikebook.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bikebook.io/</a>, select the models you&#x27;re considering, and look at features side-by-side.<p>Then, quite honestly, you should just ride them all and pick the one you like the most based on how it feels, but that&#x27;s beside the point.<p>---<p>A couple suggestions:<p>* When comparing models, I think that a table-view with individual features lined up would be more useful than the current comparison view.  That way I could quickly scan between models.<p>* I noticed some areas that could benefit from increased granularity.  For example, right now if I look at the &quot;Trek Fuel EX 29&quot; I see that it has a single field for &quot;Rear Suspension&quot; that reads: &quot;Fox Evolution Series Float w/DRCV, CTD (climb-trail-descend) damper, rebound, tuned by Trek in California, 7.25x1.875&quot;&quot; - That&#x27;s nice, but I think it would be more helpful (especially when comparing to other bikes) if that data were split up into something like:<p><i></i> Rear Suspension - Travel: 184mm<p><i></i> Rear Suspension - Manufacturer: Fox<p><i></i> Rear Suspension - Model: Evolution Series Float<p><i></i> Rear Suspension - Features: DRCV, CTD (climb-trail-descend) damper, rebound, tuned by Trek in California.<p>That way, I could quickly scan across the comparison page and realize that if I chose the Trek over the Specialized, I&#x27;d be leaving a full 11 mm of travel on the table?!  OMG, how could I even consider such a thing?!  I feel like such a fool.<p>But seriously, this is wonderful. Spec-obsessed bike nuts everywhere owe you a debt of gratitude.",1395446578

Clearly there are languages where you can effectively express unbounded recursion function() { function() } and the C preprocessor is not one of them.</i><p>>* But there are a number of subtleties going on here. For example, if we consider the set of macros I created to be the &quot;machinery&quot;, and the &quot;language&quot; to be the Brainfuck input to my system, then it is indeed Turing complete. That is - I have created machinery which can simulate Turing complete languages. Taking all the above definitions into account, consider how odd it is that Turing complete machinery can be expressed in a non Turing complete language.*<p>And from the “Brainfuck interpreter written in the C preprocessor”: <a href=""https://github.com/orangeduck/CPP_COMPLETE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/orangeduck/CPP_COMPLETE</a><p>> <i>Currently the maximum recursion depth is set to around 1000 and the data array size around 100. These can be easily extended but for now, as a general rule of thumb computations exceeding 1000 steps may not run.</i><p>Here is the problem. We can consider the one-step-interpreter: it’s a function that has as arguments a program, the current instruction index and the whole memory state, and this function computes the next instruction index and the next whole memory state. This one-step-interpreter is primitive recursive. \nHe put that function inside a bounded loop, which is also implementable as a primitive recursive function.<p>So essentially he created an interpreter that runs a program for at most a fixed number of steps, where this number is an argument of the function (or worse, in this case a constant). Interpreter(Program, Memory, MaxSteps) is a recursive primitive function. To be Turing complete, he needs to write InterpreterForEverIfNecesary(Program, Memory).<p>With a fixed MaXSteps value, it can’t compute all recursive primitive function.",1390870225

I can&#x27;t tell you when we&#x27;ll get there, but that&#x27;s the goal.<p>Now, that said... I don&#x27;t think &quot;bootstrapped&quot; or &quot;not bootstrapped&quot; is something that&#x27;s intrinsic and unchangeable.  We haven&#x27;t taken any outside money yet, but I&#x27;m not saying we <i>never</i> will.  We might do it tomorrow if the circumstances dictate that it&#x27;s the right thing to do, relative to our goals.  Or maybe next year.  Maybe never.   Outside money is just a tool, like a screwdriver or an Open Source library... we may need that particular tool, we may not.  If we do, we&#x27;ll use it. If not, we won&#x27;t use it just for the sake of using it.",1390870137

Compliance is one of the biggest challenges for creating new payment services.<p>You guys should also take a look at the Visa push-payment apis. In reality they are designed more for other API providers like yourselves to fold-in to their available push-payment options. Particularly handy for applications like marketing rebates, bill payment or expense reimbursements for payments already made on a card.  Visa transfers do have a few advantages over straight ACH - you can push funds to a debit account, a credit card account or a reloadable prepaid account. Works across borders, in some countries works real time. Also a card number can be easier and less error-prone for consumers to enter than full bank routing info (as you probably know, handling rejects on ACH is a real pain). Downsides: only works on Visa cards, but you can mitigate that with traditional fallback options like ACH, instant-issuance prepaid, or mailing a check.<p>source: I don&#x27;t have a stake in that service anymore, but I used to work on developing it.",1390868001

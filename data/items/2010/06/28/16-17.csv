I agree with this article only insofar as multiple bee stings are exponentially more painful. But I disagree with it insofar as bee stings represent 'pain' instead of logistical nightmares and high risk situations, which is what poverty, the further down you go, increasingly involves.<p>I also disagree strongly that poverty leads to irrationality. That is a very dangerous and arrogant line of thinking -- and obviously reflects a lack of understanding with the rational choices poor people face.",1277744393

The market for smaller desktop applications is pretty hard, and seems to mostly get along by the PC user-base being utterly <i>massive</i>, not by any ease-of-use.<p>Applications on OSX are a bit nicer, as there's rarely an install/uninstall process at all, and an enormous amount of the people I know with macs have bought several smaller applications for various minor needs.  Nothing that can't be faked by text files / Excel, but a nicer interface makes a difference.  Things like Sparkle also mean people update <i>far</i> more frequently.  I don't see that much in my Windows-using friends, especially in the non-geek sectors.  But OSX has a much smaller market share, and I have a feeling that a lot of the successes are due to things like MacHeist, pulling in $1/2 million+ over a couple days, which <i>do</i> make buying software <i>fun</i>.

Large financial institutions and many smaller hedge funds reap countless millions from the markets and much of this comes from proprietary trading (well, all of it in the case of hedge funds.)  There's a massive brain-drain into financial institutions of many of our best and brightest, all in search of making a fortune by the time they're 30.  So on the one hand you have top students from top institutions applying their considerable intellect and training into applying advanced mathematical methods against an extremely complex problem.  On the other you have a guy who tinkers around himself hoping after hope that the amateur (for that is by definition what he is) attempts that he makes at beating the market are going to some day work out and make him his fortune.<p>Unfortunately the odds are stacked against you, and those are compounded by fact that you have little or no opportunity to employ any serious leverage.<p>""I would have probably, or at least possibly, been wealthy by other means by now"".

The first (engineering) is about <i>features</i>: how to implement something, what it needs, what would be the cleanest conceptual approach; the second (marketing) is about <i>benefits</i>: what those features mean to someone, is it useful, what can it do, what extra features are needed just to make it work (eg. an editor isn't just about editing: you also need to be able to save your work, even though saving isn't editing).<p>There's a distinction in this case that strikes me as similar: software for its own sake is <i>abstract</i>; software that has a useful <i>application</i> is not abstract. The question then becomes whether the patent as a whole is new and inventive. Just applying an abstract idea to a concrete problem isn't enough; the way it is applied has to be inventive.<p>In legal terms, I think this throws the burden of \n<i>patentability</i> from ""subject matter"" to ""novel and nonobvious"" (Bilsky majority on Flook, emphasis added):<p>> unpatentable under §101, not because it contain[ed] a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm [wa]s <i>assumed to be within the prior art</i>, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no patentable invention.<p>tl;dr <i>you can't patent software, only its doing of something useful</i><p><i>EDIT</i> btw, typo in title: s/Bilksi/Bilski/",1277744016

1468442,comment,1467017,1467938,0,0,socksy,,,"To an extent, you're right. The Harrod-Domar model of development suggests that the amount of growth of an economy depends on the savings ratio over the capital output ratio.<p>The reason for that is a bit mathematical, so bear with me:<p>When Savings = Investment (assuming for simplicity, no foreign trade)<p><pre><code>  S=I (1)\n  now S=sY (2), </code></pre>\nwhere little s is the savings ratio, and big Y is GDP (output), and<p><pre><code>  I=ΔK,</code></pre>\nwhich is to say investment is the difference in capital stock (which is the definition of investment).<p><pre><code>  ΔK=k.ΔY</code></pre>\nwhere little k is the capital output ratio (amount of output produced per change in capital),<p><pre><code>  so I=k.ΔY (3).</code></pre>\nSubstituting (2) & (3) into (1) gives you:<p><pre><code>  sY=k.ΔY</code></pre>\nrearranging gives you<p><pre><code>  ΔY/Y = s/k</code></pre>\nor in other words, the rate of growth of GDP depends on the propensity of an economy to save, and then how much of that saving goes into output.<p>So in a sense, you're right, but there's more to it than that.<p>The problems occur when there's <i>too much</i> hoarding going on. Think of these two theoretical extremes:<p>1) <i>Everyone saves, no-one spends.</i> (Leaving aside starvation and human needs for the moment)<p>- Obviously, since no-one spends anything, no-one ever gets paid. No transactions happen at all, and interest rates drop (no-one's borrowing anything!) so people suffer, and experience poorer standards of living as a result. There's a lot of money, but no-one's doing anything with it.<p>2) <i>No-one saves at all, and everyone spends what they earn relatively quickly</i><p>- In comparison to 1), this would mean that you're likely to be being paid a lot, and quicker. You immediately spend this money on goods, so your quality of life (in theory) increases immediately. It doesn't matter that you don't have the money any more, as the next person along that you spent your money on also immediately spends their money. Money travels around fast (the speed of which it does this is known as the velocity of money), and so you're soon being paid more money again, which again improves your quality of life. No saving takes place - but no-one minds as there's so much money going around that bootstrapping a business suddenly becomes a lot easier.<p>Obviously, 2) is unfortunately rather impossible to achieve - due to various factors such as confidence and the difficulty in getting everyone to spend lots. One noted problem is that rich people spend more money than poor people - but they spend a smaller proportion of their income. Imagine someone with £100,000 pa (after tax). They spend say, 20% of their income at £20,000 a year. Now imagine someone earning a paltry £10,000 pa (after tax). They're likely to spend a higher proportion of their income, say 80% at £8000 a year. 10 of these poorer people will spend £80,000 a year.  So the theory goes, it's better to have more people all spending and increasing the velocity of money, than a few very rich people all hoarding.<p>In the real world, savings matter, because you can't get everyone to spend lots of money all the time. However, these savings accounts can't be high enough to jeopardise spending. It's a bit of a tightrope.",1277742753

IIRC, in 2000-2001 we had the dot-com crash and its various effects on the economy, but there was a relatively fast recovery, partly due to low interest rates. Low interest rates in and of themselves didn't directly affect consumers' habits, but they did have a powerful indirect effect in the form of easy credit.<p>This easy credit prompted the poor and lower middle classes to overextend themselves. They took the opportunity to buy consumer products they couldn't technically afford, in the form of new cars, electronics, furnishings, etc., and that in turn caused a brief period of economic boom.<p>But, one of the interesting things about the poor and lower middle classes is -- despite another article on HN this morning -- they're always on the lookout for a way out of their situation. Especially anything that looks like a ""cheap"" solution.<p>The housing market. The combination of cheap credit -- with lenders practically falling over themselves to hand out loans to individuals that didn't qualify on paper for the loans -- along with the mentality of the lower socio-economic classes that housing was suddenly ""a good investment"" -- because prices were going up, up, up and <i>nobody</i> at the time believed they could ever fall -- caused a housing gold rush.<p>In places like the Bay Area, a lot of the available land for new housing is party far removed from everything else. This is the classic suburban housing model, and it's also going to be factor.<p>Because, things actually were going pretty great for about a year or two. If your credit was shaky for any reason, you couldn't afford to move or buy a house, but hey, everyone else is happy. And, remarkably, the price of basic goods and services didn't <i>seem</i> to change much during that period -- just the price of housing, which exploded.<p>And then, in a perceptibly short period of about a year or so, gas prices went through the roof. (I still don't understand why that happened, but it was timed nicely with the war in Iraq.)<p>What happens if you're running down a hill as fast as you can, and then you try to make a slight course correction? There's a pretty good chance that you eat pavement, and that's what started to happen.<p>The over-extended poor and lower middle classes had by this time used much of their available credit, and they were doing fine, unless the day-to-day cost of living changed much. Thing is, many of them had nice homes that were a 30 minute commute from work, and many of them had nice, huge vehicles. Both of those turned into the perfect storm of a price sensitivity on gas.<p>The first stumble happened in the car market. The distinctly American SUV, which had been considered invincible, suddenly started to see a slow-down in sales. A slow-down of anything in a bubble economy makes people nervous, but there didn't seem to be a very noticeable reaction from any major groups.<p>But, the price of gas stayed fairly relentlessly high, and significant numbers of people started to fall slightly behind on their credit card payments. This led to effect number 2: a very slight downward change in consumer spending.<p>The really neat effect though was on housing. Seemingly overnight, nobody wanted to move farther away from work. Houses started to stay on the market longer, but the prices didn't drop, at first. Thing is, too many of the people trying to sell were doing so because they themselves were overextended in credit, and they were trying to get some of that free equity out of their home that everyone had promised them.<p>Realtors at the time were still naively optimistic though, so they -- nearly to a one -- encouraged their sellers to stick to their price and wait it out.<p>The net effect was precisely what most people had considered impossible: the housing market stalled, and then crashed.<p>The lower socio-economic classes by now were really beat up financially, so even when the price of gas fell again, they just weren't spending money anymore. A huge number of people got soaked on their home purchases, seeing decades of savings evaporate seemingly overnight.<p>The big financiers and creditors then ran into trouble, and we all know the rest.<p>I think that the price of gas was the metaphorical straw that broke our economy's back, but I also think that the trends at the time were totally unsustainable and doomed to failure eventually. I also see how people are so willing to blame low interest rates and cheap credit (two sides of the same coin), but the thing is, those also resulted in the rapid growth of economy. What few people want to admit is that a healthy modern economy absolutely depends on the lower socio-economic classes spending money; the more they spend, the better off everyone else is. Maybe someday our economy won't work that way, but for now, it does.<p>Without those low interest rates, it's just as likely that we would have seen a long period of stagnation coming out of the dot-com crash. Whether that would have been intrinsically better or worse for us is way over my head.",1277742196

For example, if you want to learn a weight vector w that gives high likelihood to the data and has a gaussian prior with 0 mean and C<i>identity covariance, the MAP answer is ""minimize -log(likelihood) + C</i>||w||"", where ||w|| is the square norm of w. Equivalently, if the prior is a laplacian you just change the norm from the l2 to the l1 norm.<p>Being bayesian gives you an extra capability that is model averaging, and this does usually improve the behavior at a high computational cost.<p>I really like bayesian models, and right now I'm experimenting with one that should do unsupervised sentiment analysis without a priori knowledge of word polarity or things like that (yes, I'm a phd student in machine learning).",1277742192

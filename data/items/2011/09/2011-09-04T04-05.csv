Nothing to retire off of, but it would have been a nice pay day had the company grown to an appreciable size (i.e. valuation). Unfortunately that never came to be. After a few haphazard mergers and acquisitions and a downright terrible financial performance my options were worthless when I left. My new employer is a much smaller startup. We'll see how it goes over the next year or two.",1315112372

In a language with lots of diacritics, the number of codepoints might be more than the number of normalized characters (depending on the client). You wouldn't want to allow (say) ~70 Korean characters on one OS, and 140 on another, just because they use different codepoints to represent certain characters - one with character then diacritic (2 codepoints?), another with both crammed together in one codepoint.<p>But as I said, I'm not a unicode guru (and I don't know much about Korean, I just saw it as an example).

The entire group each time (I somehow made this mistake TWICE) had a hard time coming to common solutions around the most trivial decisions.<p>Until you have something like a manifesto with a long set of explanations of what will be expected of everyone, you shouldn't even try to START forming the group. No more than a set of 3-4 friends should write the manifesto, either, or it won't have enough teeth.<p>And there's a downside here, too: If you're going to live together with a lot of people with shared rules, the one thing you DON'T want is a lot of cultural diversity, at least not before the rules are set down and the new ""diverse"" members have bought into them.<p>I've seen a community with strict vegans who wouldn't ever attend a meal where meat was served and other members who wouldn't eat if there wasn't a hefty meat portion. Now everyone gets their own kitchens, but the optional 2-3 times a week ""common meals"" were a strong way to stay connected with others in the community -- except in that they were also a source of conflict, for meat/no-meat and other reasons.<p>tl;dr: Living together with (say) 30 other people is somewhat like being in a marriage with 30 other people, only with fewer benefits.

Writing letters to the editor (because people still read the paper), aligning with community social organizations, being more actively involved in their communities.<p>So now we're able to form narrowcast tribes across geographic (and even temporal) boundaries.  Are we better off?  En masse, such connections may leave whole societies better off (Arab spring) but I think that perhaps we won't realize the full benefits until the focus returns to the local.  And that won't happen until there's a rise in the locality of the internet.<p>Think reinvention of the local paper; or maybe a craigslist for the issues of the day.<p>And that can't happen until the technology is in the hands and power of EVERYONE.  Think Kindles (or iPads, or whatever) in a rack at your McDonalds, literally replacing the local paper.  Perhaps the biggest advancement here is the price point; but we need to cut that iPad cost in half perhaps 5-8 more times for this access to happen.<p>When that day hits--the day of the ubiquitous $1 Kindle--then I think we can claim democratization, and we will see a return to locality and the strengthening of our communities.",1315111097

The Accumulo way also gets you some efficiency because it never even has to transfer the cells that get filtered by the permissions (or even fully read their content from disk, possibly).<p>Even though each cell isn't separately encrypted to get you true security at the cell level (which would destroy your performance, I'd guess), this seems like a huge win if you want to have permissions at the cell level.",1315110515

Others will pirate it because they can't afford it, and I think that there's a compelling argument to be made that many of those will eventually become regular consumers when they've got the money to do so. There surely is a group of dyed-in-the-wool douchebags who will never buy anything they can pirate because they are, at their cores, Bad People, but them's the breaks--I've come to the gradual understanding that these people are shitty human beings who will screw others so long as they don't have to look them in the eye to do so, and all you can do is write them off.<p>But I think that, for the most part, if you treat your potential customers right, they'll do right by you. (The same is not true, I think, of ""donate what you want""--I strongly feel that method of revenue generation encourages people to pay as little as they can rationalize, and what even nominally 'good' people can rationalize is really really small. But that's another topic.)",1315109474

2958779,story,,,1,0,1Place,"An inventor's biological clock",http://blog.1place.com.au/2011/09/03/an-inventor%E2%80%99s-biological-clock/#more-1656,"The average inventor is more likely to be:<p>a) Older - there is a higher incidence of inventors aged in their 40s to 50s who file patents; and
b) Self determining - an inventor is less likely to be associated with a large firm or a university.<p>Inventors do not have disproportionally more genius genes, but are highly motivated and therefore are driven to make a difference. Studies of identical twins separated at birth indicates that creative thinking is:<p>a) less genetically based (estimated to be a one third contribution);
b) more learning based (estimated to be a two-thirds contribution) leading to creating confidence in the capacity to create.
What does the above profile represent? Why are inventors generally older? Is there a biological clock for inventing?<p>There are many exceptions to the above profile; however, perhaps we should consider Maslows pyramid of hierarchy of needs.  This pyramid has basic needs at its base, such as food and shelter, and self-actualisation at the peak.<p>Self-actualisation was coined by Abraham Maslow, a professor of psychology, who believed that focus should be on the positive qualities in people. Maslows postulate was that, to be a fully formed self, an individual has to move from the potential of ""what you can be"" to realise what ""you must be"".  That is, you must fulfil your full potential. Perhaps patent filing as a form of self-actualisation, since it occurs at a later stage of one's working life?<p>Inventors need networks
To achieve self-actualisation as inventors, people need networks to form the basis of learning.<p>You and your hypothetical identical twin have the same ability, invention and background. However, the outcome is different if:<p>a) you stay in the shed tinkering, whilst
b) your identical twin communicates with many people from diverse backgrounds.
In the above scenario, your identical twin will have a better output. The difference within these results are realised within a week. Thus, communication is critical to develop inventions.<p>What role can a patent have?
A patent helps an individual publish an identity as an inventor which provides the means to engage with a like community. The inventor then may learn from members of a like-focused community. This provides a basis for reflection for the inventor and growth for the inventive concept.<p>Patents would therefore have a much greater contribution to both the individual and the community if patents were linked with communication systems.  Should patent databases have communication links embedded? Do patent databases have the potential to be the next Facebook?<p>Self-actualisation takes place in less than 1% of the adult population.  Likewise, inventors are also a rare species.  Could this be because the tools to aid invention remain hidden from a large part of the population?<p>Patents, when taking the form of a communication means for invention, must become less impenetrable and more accessible. Patents often remain hidden from like minded inventors because they speak in a language that is more typical of patent attorneys than inventors.<p>Peer-to-Patent - the new communication means?
The Peer-to-Patent systems implemented over the last two years were one step forward; however, their benefits are not yet realised.  Further, the US implementation of the peer to patent project was concluded after two years due to the economic downturn. Perhaps this can now give rise to a wiki-patent site to focus more strongly on communication of patent technology, rather than uncovering prior art for the benefit of the patent examination process. If you think this idea has teeth  maybe we could start one?<p>Inventors are nurtured and the tools for nurturing should be developed to capture invention. Maybe Patent Offices around the world could incorporate inventor communication tools and open their protocols to allow a web 2.0 site to flourish.",1315108925

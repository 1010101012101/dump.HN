7783345,comment,7782491,7782935,9,0,gone35,,,"Close. Aaronson&#x27;s most devastating argument (he offers two more) is that Tonini&#x27;s \\Phi or &quot;integrated information&quot; of an input-output system (function), under a reasonable operationalization as a measure of how correlated subsets of inputs are with subsets of outputs, is just not good measure of &quot;consciousness&quot; because, as it happens, large families of rather mundane systems that one wouldn&#x27;t think as &quot;conscious&quot; in fact have <i>provably large</i> &quot;integrated information&quot; or \\Phi by design --such as Reed-Solomon codes, for instance.<p>Put in another way, if Tonini were right then your (say) portable DVD player ought to be &quot;conscious&quot; because, surprisingly, the amount of &quot;integrated information&quot; achieved by the scratch- and skip-tolerant error-correcting code it uses internally has to be <i>huge</i> in order for it to work. But that is <i>prima facie</i> ridiculous; so either we are wrong and the DVD player is in fact &quot;conscious&quot; or, more likely, Tononi&#x27;s proposed definition of consciousness is lacking.<p>Again as I said Aaronson makes two other points, but I think this one alone is the most conclusive.",1400759936

CocoaPods might be useful if there were a lot of high quality library code out there that we could use, but right now, like Mike, I just don&#x27;t see it.<p>The main use-case I can see for something <i>like</i> CocoaPods actually has to do with commercial library code---i.e. code that you purchase and for which you get proper support.<p>I&#x27;ll also add this: CocoaPods, as it stands today, also creates a risk, in that it&#x27;s possible that an updated version of some library you&#x27;re depending on might have a different license---maybe one that&#x27;s incompatible with the license for the software you&#x27;re working on.

7783325,comment,7781842,7781842,2,0,seanccox,,,"A few years ago, I designed some paper-based puzzle quests for friends visiting historical sites in Istanbul, and around that time I heard about a US company doing something similar on a mobile device: SCVNGR.<p>I don&#x27;t code, and mobile tech is unreliable for short-term visitors to Istanbul, so I never bothered trying to port the content to a device. Basically though, the solutions to puzzles are used to decipher new material and explore the spaces more thoroughly. For example, everyone who goes to the Hagia Sophia visits the mosaic portrait of the Empress Zoe, but not everyone knows about the Viking runes carved into a stone banister, so the idea was to link things and challenge people to explore, and then to use what they had found to unlock other puzzles.<p>It was clunky as shit on paper, and sometimes friends would give up or call to ask for clues, but they said they enjoyed it (or they were really, really polite). On a device, I&#x27;m sure that sort of interaction would be simple, and it&#x27;s something I still toy with learning to build, but Istanbul keeps happening to me and getting in the way.",1400759551

I could see it in Japan, people being terribly busy at work, yet producing very little, spending most of the time during the day at job, unable to do anything in their spare time. I guess that&#x27;s how Asian society makes sure there is no unexpected creativity leading to &quot;interesting times&quot;. It could also help individual people to cope with social anxieties by being &quot;busy&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the same were happening in the States. I don&#x27;t believe people can be super-productive more than 5 hours a day unless they work on something they are passionate about or are on drugs.<p>From my experience, just walking away from a difficult problem, taking time to walk in the forest, relax on the beach, playing sports with friends, doing completely unrelated relaxing things with total focus often leads to sudden inspirations on how to tackle difficult problems. It&#x27;s like life is telling me to relax and rewards me with great ideas that can be immediately executed, for being just well balanced.<p>I remember flying with one US businessman between Hawaiian islands, and he curiously asked me how many vacation days do I have - when I told him it&#x27;s 6 weeks, he went on to complain about how crazy is it in the States, with average of 8.5 day or so of vacation per year.<p>People, please live your lives!",1400759257

CCTV footage is usually used (ostensibly) for security or logistical purposes (e.g. traffic management) and comparatively rarely ends up on YouTube or Facebook. Glass footage on the other hand is acquired by a private individual with less visible motives and no oversight. That&#x27;s not to say that CCTV footage is never abused or personal footage usually is, but on balance I would expect more people to be concerned about being recorded by a random stranger than by a random shop.<p>Secondly, the &#x27;almost covert&#x27; nature of Glass makes it feel to me inherently creepier - you can see if someone is pointing a phone or standalone video camera at you, but if someone looks your way wearing Glass, are they recording you? I expect many people (particularly women, given some of the websites out there) would feel nervous about that. It&#x27;s easier to consent to being recorded when you know its happening, and therefore also easier to prevent it if you don&#x27;t consent.<p>I expect that a person holding a phone in front of them everywhere they went as if filming would experience a similar level of hostility to that reported by some Glass users.",1400759150

7783202,comment,7782491,7782828,5,0,Udo,,,"There is little doubt that the cat is conscious, and the idea that consciousness is a gradient with more than one dimension is not really in dispute. In fact, you can build a very simple gradient model by observing nothing but humans: a human baby is scarcely conscious at all, a toddler is pretty much on par with the cat, and a grown human has a higher level still. The reason why we think this is true is based on at least two things: awareness and meta-awareness (which includes the ability to reason about one&#x27;s own existence as well as the world in general).<p>The cat and the toddler are clearly conscious in the sense that they do have a recognizable life experience. They don&#x27;t just react to the environment, they make models of it, and they have a limited ability to abstract observations. They experience life, and they have complex dreams and emotions. However, they still lack a deeper understanding of causalities, and they can grasp the subjective realities of other beings only on an instinctive level. Adult humans are less limited in this regard, but it&#x27;s easy to imagine hypothetical beings who perform better still.<p>That&#x27;s bad news for the validity of consciousness as a concept, since it seems to be interlinked with intelligence, which itself is a fuzzy idea at best.<p>So these observations amount to the position that &quot;consciousness&quot; isn&#x27;t a fundamental property at all, it&#x27;s the result of other processes and it can come in different flavors. Likewise, the concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; is similarly flawed. In both, we tend to make the mistake of looking at them as simple scalar values. They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re a name we give for a collection of different capabilities. As such, I believe a mathematical model of consciousness is actually pretty unscientific, since consciousness is not an objective property. It&#x27;s an artificial label we&#x27;re obsessed with.",1400757193

Decentralization seems ideal. But some of the most successful services so far either begun or are centralized, not decentralized. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, the electric and water utilities, Google, and Facebook are all centralized for example. On the other hand, other services like email and the web (excluding DNS) are decentralized.<p>Is the intention behind this idea that control over those services shouldn&#x27;t be centralized, while pooling resources could be ok, depending on the service involved?.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s possible to remove control in a centralized service, but I am saying that there is a distinction. A blanket statement that &quot;centralized services can&#x27;t survive&quot; would seem incorrect, and the existing statement of &quot;as little centralized elements&quot; implies that &quot;as little&quot; in the relative sense will be equal to little in the absolute sense, which might not be true. It could be that &quot;little&quot; practically equals centralization.<p>The reason such a misconception is dangerous is that one might put their efforts in designing a fully decentralized service that isn&#x27;t adopted.

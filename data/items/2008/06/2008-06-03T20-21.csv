For another, even if it applied to books, that doesn't mean that it would apply to everything. It's quite possible that a few things (like books) have been limited largely by real world constraints and were waiting for someone like Amazon to come by and free them from the 80/20 rule, but that most things were not.<p>People bandy about ""the long tail"" as if it's some sort of conclusive proof that conventional economics is in the process of being shaken up by these new distribution methods, when in reality that's just conjecture and doesn't yet seem to be the case.",1212526742

For example, there are few consequences for missing deadlines (if there are any deadlines), there is little to no management structure, and there are no perpetually changing requirements that you have to meet. There are plenty of things you can learn from working in a large company from both positive and negative examples, and it sounds like you want to learn those things.<p>I don't see how working for a big company would be more against your entrepreneurial/hacker spirit than school was. You're going there to learn something. It won't always be pleasant, but it's a means to an end.<p>Also, as an entrepreneur, you'll eventually have to manage people.

That script also runs in the <i>one</i> Apache master listener, which means that no other incoming requests will be answered until the rewrite script returns its output.<p>If I were instead using mod_perl (as I suspect I will be, before this moves into production) I would be able to have each Apache child process handle its own forking of backends for requests it was handling.",1212524652

It counter-intuitive but it has been shown that a second place auction generates the same revenue as a first place auction, partly because participants compensate for only paying the second highest bid. Indeed, the second place auction system can sometimes cause a bidding fenzy, which leads to auction addiction.<p>However, a simple application of game theory is to minimise information the is revealed unnecessarily. Therefore, if you treat the auction as a sealed bid auction and snipe in the last minute then you save money.<p>However, the main problem with EBay is the glut of uncontested auctions. I ran a survey on auctions using a script and I found that less than 1/3 of auctions received any bids at all. Much fewer received two or more bids.",1212524262

Rails, on the other hand, is a big framework. You can learn the basics in a few days, but much like PHP, you really can't master the ins-and-outs of the full stack without (at least) several months of regular use.<p>It's also a moving target: new APIs fade in and out of existence with pretty much every release, and many ""best practices"" (early RESTful routing, anyone?) are picked up and dropped pretty much according to the whims of DHH and the other core committers.<p>That's not to say that it isn't worth learning, of course; if you're willing to commit to using Rails pretty much full-time (and work within its limitations) for the bulk of your projects, it offers a lot of great infrastructure to build on.

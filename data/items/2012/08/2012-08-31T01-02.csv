It's a very different experience to learn something from somebody with a passion for subject X than someone who is paid to teach subject X. Were I a parent, I would rather find 5-10 other talented/smart/skilled parents that each have unique passions and share in the effort of teaching my kid and theirs whatever it is that is in my ability to share.<p>The good teachers in school are those that are passionate enough that you as a student forget that they are being paid to be there and impart knowledge upon you.<p>TBH, the closest thing we have to such an arrangement today is Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

As reviewers of papers we can and must hold authors accountable to their claims. You can't just claim that your algorithm is superior without comparing it to the work of others on a set of community agreed upon benchmark problems. The scientific review process needs to hold authors accountable for their claims. It isn't an easy task, but with some work it is possible to establish fair metrics.

A few gripes (I understand that Lift.do just released, so some of these concerns may be premature)<p>1. It's binary - in that you workout or you don't, you sleep 8 hours or you don't. My needs are a bit different - I want to be able to log <i>how much</i> I do of something. For e.g. drinking water - I want to track that I drink enough water. The only solution I had was to use a habit titled ""Drink 8 glasses of water"" - For me, that doesn't work (I have to keep count of how many glasses of water I drank in the day). I want to ""check in"" every time I do something - if it's a workout, then a check-in a day suffices - if I want to sleep 8 hours but only manage 7, well, there's no way to manage that.<p>2. Export functionality - I want to export my data out of Lift.<p>The only app I have come across that let's me do this right is Dayta (free for iOS) - Unfortunately it has not seen any movement lately but it's very close to what I need. What Dayta does not get right is<p>1. No defaults. If I don't make an entry for a day, it does not assume 0<p>2. Only numeric data - For e.g Workout (in my case) is either a 1 or a 0 - It would be nice to have a Boolean switch<p>3. Dayta exports nicely - to CSV via email. I export on a month to month basis which means I usually go back in and have to delete the entries for the past month. Dayta gives you no way to ""bulk delete"" - You have to swipe each entry and delete.<p>4. Lift.do gets this right - Notes on a check-in. After a workout I want to know how I felt. Perhaps I did not hit the 6 mile marker - Was I sick? Or injured? Or just being lazy?<p>Along with all this it would be nice to<p>1. Plot a habit that has a scheduled interval. For e.g workout every other day (Perhaps a reminder or a gentle nudge)<p>2. Identify habits you aren't doing so well at.<p>I am currently using a mix of apps to track my progress - Momento (Journal app), Dayta, and Fitocracy (to log workouts in detail).<p>FWIW, Lift.do is a gorgeous app. I really like the way it looks, feels and works. The social element is a nice touch too.<p>Good luck guys. I am keeping an eye on you - Perhaps soon I will change my mind.<p>[Updated to add a 4th point and for some clarification]",1346376734

It allows the UI to act as a feedback loop between the human and the computer so that the human can incrementally guide the computer to do what they want. A command line is more effective when the user knows exactly what they want done and can recall immediately how to do it.<p>""Not knowing the parameters"" can come in two main forms. The first is when the user simply may not have used the feature enough to be able to instantly recall all of the parameters needed and how they should be set. For example, a print dialog displays three or four commonly tweaked parameters to a user, and gives easy access to as many as several dozen more advanced parameters. This is far more useful than a CLI would be, except perhaps to a very small minority of users.<p>The other form is when you may know <i>what</i> the parameters are, but need feedback to choose them correctly. For example, resizing a window is well-suited to a mouse. Obviously you know that the four parameters are the height and width of the window, but few people can glance at their screen and say ""Oh, I need this window to be 348 pixels wide now"".",1346376386

Thanks for taking the time to write it and to point it out here.<p>However, one of the points you made as an argument against authenticated encryption modes is actually a point for it, unless I'm not getting something. The point I'm referring to is that people write bad code and that every line of code includes a potential security vulnerability. Every time someone uses CTR+MAC, they're writing code to glue those together, and there are opportunities for missteps. Furthermore, that code that is viewed by a small number of people. By using an authenitcated encrytion mode, one can reduce the  lines of code you're writing because it the functionality is provided by the implementation, which will certainly have been looked at more times than one's own project.<p>[Edit]<p>Maybe this is what I was missing: ""Encrypt-then-MAC is essentially impossible to get cryptologically wrong.""",1346375588

I know that sounds stupid but it is.<p>The fashion part comes from what it means to be 'hip' which entirely driven by the flavor of the hour. We've talked about it on HN a bit but the best analog is that the coolness factor of 'doing a startup' got to be high enough that we got a huge influx of people who ""want to do a startup"" which is distinct and different from folks who ""want to do X, this is the company I created to do that.""<p>Too many people these days are doing startups like they used to do rock bands.<p>The second part is money. When rich people do it, especially people who were ""like you"" before but are now ""rich"" it creates a sense in folks that don't know any better that it is easy, or that anyone can do it. It is what causes people to move to LA from Nebraska to make it big in the movies.<p>So no, it is not a new phenomena. And the proportion of the bullshit to actual content is proportional to the fashion + money aspect. In 2000-2001 after the dot com bust was settling, none of the cool kids wanted to be startup people any more, so the people you ran into who were doing startups were more likely to be doing it because they believed in what they were doing.

Not only is it a good motivator to stay after whatever I'm working on, it's also a great way to make sure I'm working on what I'm interested in.  Without fail, it makes me focus on what I really should be doing, which, sadly, is not always what I AM doing.",1189356582

An attacker shouldn't be able to construct a ""your-salt"" rainbow table to crack all the passwords on your machine; she should have to constrct N rainbow tables, for each of the passwords.

52497,comment,52487,52487,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Correction: passwords are routinely stored in plain text (or reversably encrypted); there are a variety of challenge-response protocols that you can't run if all you have is the hash. It's a tradeoff; what do you care more about, passwords at rest or passwords in motion?

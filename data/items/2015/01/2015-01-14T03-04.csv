By which I mean I know it isn&#x27;t the Node project, but where is most of the mindshare these days? Is io.js a small offshoot or has it taken most of the Node devs with it? Or is it the same code just with a more aggressive release schedule?<p>Also, when do we go back to one executable already?",1421207936

However, if it&#x27;s as cool as described, definitely might give it a shot.<p>Edit2: Is this expected to be as stable as Node.js consistently? And how solid is the upgrade path- is it going to be a pain upgrading between versions the way Node used to be, or is there a smoother upgrade process? I guess what I&#x27;m wondering is, do I get any benefit from using this right now, or would it be smart to still wait for whatever version they consider release quality?",1421207838

People had to learn new skills and get a new education to learn how to service cars and make parts for cars.<p>When the microcomputer, word processor, printer got invented a whole room of 100 people on typewriters lost their jobs because one administrative assistant can press a few buttons to print 100 copies of a memo or letter to distribute. Then that got replaced with attached files in email or on a file server.<p>There used to be five and dime stores, run by mom and pop operations. Until Sam Walton found a way to bundle services at his five and dime store and then use a computer to manage his inventory better and buy it in bulk at cheaper prices to undercut the other mom and pop stores and then take on the big guys. Suddenly Walmart put Woolworths out of business and caused damage to Sears and K-Mart. But that was before Amazon.com got formed and did the same things but with robots in warehouses to pick items for orders, and a 24/7 website with bundled services with Amazon Prime to give free two day shipping, free videos, and other benefits.<p>Now we got the Dotcom era with startups, each startup has a way to have a website that automates things that does things cheaper or for free that puts people out of work.<p>You even got programs that write programs now, you got Ruby on Rails that anyone can use to create a web app even without knowledge on how a computer works, without a degree, and with just six weeks of training in how to use it.<p>I myself had worked so hard automating things for companies that I developed mental and physical illnesses from the stress and ended up on disability. I took paper forms and made electronic forms stored in databases that put people out of work and made the system more efficient.

Even if they do earn a degree the student loan debt will cripple them if they cannot find a good paying job that can pay off enough of it that they can afford a house and car.<p>At some point you will see Unemployment, Disability, Social Security going away and replaced with Basic Income. Basic income will be paid for by taxing the corporations that use robots and automation and giving it to people who can no longer work for any reason at all. There will be resistance to this, but it will have to be done or face a major homeless and poverty problem.<p>There are still ways to earn an income without a job, make a series of Youtube videos and advertise on them, write books, try to become an artist or musician and do a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign to form your own company, etc.",1421207205

I don&#x27;t think that the two groups you&#x27;ve painted are discrete, much less distinct.  Of the descriptions you&#x27;ve given, I fit much more clearly in the former (I spend far more time digging around old Github repos and fantasizing about Arduino projects to try with my soon-to-be-born child).<p>However, the technical detail of this article is not lost on me.  The authors have gone to painstaking lengths to template the picture of a flashbang incident and fill it in with instances (shown in aside#injuries).  They have produced an informative graphic map showing a specific technical detail of the policy implementation in Little Rock (the exact locations and a demographic element).<p>The prose itself is replete with other technical details, such as the types of injuries suffered and how they were treated and the specific legislation being considered in light of these events.<p>These details may not describe anything electronic or even futuristic, but they are technical in the sense that they&#x27;re measurable and require illumination via intense study in order to understand and present.<p>Just like an interpreter optimization or a new design pattern, the various calls to action need to be sufficiently compelling as to motivate a critical mass to call for change, and so supporters (and perhaps opponents) have gathered around them.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;political&quot; are just words that we use to couch &quot;familiar&quot; and &quot;controversial.&quot;<p>I do agree that more technical details of how flashbangs work (especially what, if any, tactical advantages they actually confer and how we know that) are desirable.",1421205470

Found my job a year and a half ago, interviewing candidates for a junior now.<p>First off, I can see how you might miss out on a lot of potential clients because you don&#x27;t know just how good they are. You could reduce this miss rate by getting good at fishing out details from people you approach or who approach you. Even be prepared to write their resumes. I&#x27;d recommend having a technical person on staff to assist with the buzzword bingo and alphabet soup.<p>Second, a lot of people simply might not know how to negotiate a job search, but wouldn&#x27;t really be lucrative enough to chase as clients. By-the-hour consulting might turn into a decent revenue stream. Then they can come to you in a few years when they are ready to chase the big bucks.<p>Third, there&#x27;s a lot of wishful thinking out there that causes seekers to not chase or turn down perfectly good jobs because of that haunting vision of landing that whopper $120K+ job. (in Atlanta) Being able to tactfully talk them into a perfectly good $85K job could work out well for both of you. I&#x27;ve seen lots of really good guys strike out interviewing for those unicorn jobs because the company has ridiculously selective criteria. I know a guy holding out for $110K but doesn&#x27;t want to go where he could legitimately make that money with his skills, e.g. a Java shop.

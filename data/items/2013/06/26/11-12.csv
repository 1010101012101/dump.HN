I was told by a high school admissions counselor, back when such topics were interesting enough to consider counter-terrorism and terrorism research interesting (thank God I saw the light and chose different interests over time) that the graduate of my high school who went to one of the most prestigious schools in that field (St. Andrews in Scotland, if you can believe; lots of weirdos in the CT scene graduated from there because professors are field policy guys with more war stories and connections than common sense) had interesting experiences.<p>He ended up doing CT for the state of Illinois.  His greatest concern, as told to me, was water systems.  There is terribly security at water reservoirs and water utility systems, worse than nuclear powerplants and other sensitive infrastructure.  The simulations they did with predicting terrorists poisoning water supplies made him lose sleep, regularly, and he was one guy in one of fifty states who was paid to focus on such things, because he, not others felt it was a priority.<p>At the end of the day physical and digital security are similar: no network can be 100% secure and everything is mitigation, so is living in the real world.

Use a debugger, deconstruct the function etc. When you get to the end you now have a fix for your function. Make that change in your file and, thanks to auto reload all of the objects in memory are immediately running the fixed function. You can then carry on working with the objects as though the bug was never there.<p>Depending on your scenario this can be a major win. On my project it&#x27;s not uncommon for it to take 10 minutes to load and process that data from disk to get it into objects in memory.

If indeed you have found your way, I cheer you on while being fully aware I have no immediate value to add to your life on this earth (But that&#x27;s a lie as I believe it concerns you just the same). If you have not found your way, I have every intension of letting you know at some point how you _can_ live and where you _can_ place importance. I find that to be the noblest thing I can do within my capacity. The most economical is to die, but I&#x27;ve settled on such an arrangement not being very helpful to others in the long run. So I exist, if for nothing else, to see whatever&#x27;s been within materialize in the hands of those who need it most. Few in life need to create bridges I have no other choice worthy of attention.<p>I maintain, highlighting the problems are easy, real solutions prove ever elusive. Short term gains, smoke and wind are always in play. Long term views are seen as an expensive liability. It&#x27;s acceptable institutional policy to induce with wild garauntees that work for a time but fall apart at scale. Innovation is no longer sought and who&#x27;s meaning holds no further weight. No one stops to question &#x27;til shit hits the fan and life directly impacted. It only takes a crisis to see the climate is every man for him/herself.  Last of all, it is so incredibly easy to forget, to be seduced and lulled into the sweet soft comforts of a soothing caress... there are no larger issues ahead my dear, no erosion taking place, let&#x27;s question no more, be open-minded (hear that?) and live happily ever after.<p>So I commend someone is stopping to ask the kinds of questions exhibited on <a href=""http://maladroit4u.neocities.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maladroit4u.neocities.org</a> and agree with the oft saying, &quot;an unexamined life is not worth living&quot;. I also felt it important to stress the author expresses a serious issue for <i>some</i>. And high on that list is equity.<p>I would be interested in knowing what was the author&#x27;s tipping point.",1372244890

5945280,comment,5942912,5942912,1,0,lsiebert,,,"Off hand, It sounds like your project manager was talking without really thinking about it. These expectations sound kinda unprofessional. It&#x27;s his job as a product manager to motivate you, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he knows how to actually do that.<p>Personally I think being 100% into your job indicates a lack of a healthy balance.  It&#x27;s called overtime for a reason, and repeated studies have shown that a 40 hour work week is optimal, and that hours above that may create a temporary increase in productivity, but a long term decrease if maintained.<p>I&#x27;d broach the topic with a friendly coworker and get a read on the situation, and use that in your dealing with your product manager.<p>I&#x27;d take a look at Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s how to make friends and influence people.  It&#x27;s a bit dated, but an easy read that will give you some suggestions as to how to think about dealing with your manager.<p>You need to figure out, why is your project manager saying these things?  What are his/her ultimate goals, beyond the intermediate things you mentioned? What does he/she value, as a person?<p>Maybe he&#x27;s/she&#x27;s saying these things because he/she wants to feel useful.  Maybe he/she is under pressure from his boss to improve productivity, and he/she is going about it in a backwards way.  Maybe they are squeezing you because your new, and they thinks they can get more out of you.<p>Ultimately, you may have to figure out if you want to take on additional responsibilities, and if so, what do you feel is fair compensation for such efforts, and if not, how to deal with these suggestions. But if you have an issue with them, it&#x27;s better to say something sooner rather than later.<p>My guess is that this person has no idea that you are this bothered by what he/she said, and that you feel disrespected. They may not care or may take offense if you approach the issue in those terms, hence the Carnegie book, so you can use what they actually care about to get them to see where you are coming from and try to resolve things in a mutually satisfactory manner.",1372244743

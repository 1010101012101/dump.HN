6839589,comment,6838494,6839274,3,0,juliangamble,,,"What we see in Clojure (like other Lisps) is minimal syntax directed at the idea of homoiconicity. This means that the program&#x27;s structure is similar to its syntax. It also means that we can represent the program as a data structure in the language itself.<p>So (1) Simple syntax, and (2) being able to represent the program structure in the language easily, both lead to making it easy to build compilers, interpreters and bytecode compilers. The barrier to entry for these tasks is lower in Clojure.<p>Many would also say that (1) and (2) make Clojure a joy to program in, but I&#x27;ll leave that to the reader to judge for themselves.",1386067829

Nowhere does it say whether female brains where 0.1% more connected, 1%, 10%, 100% or 1000% across hemispheres. It just says &quot;more connected.&quot; So, if you want to calibrate your gender difference prejudices those numbers are very important -- without them the article doesn&#x27;t say very much.",1386067817

6839586,comment,6829463,6834790,1,0,lanbird,,,"2. All the best games like GTA, metal gear solid is out on the first of the days when the console is out. Marketing. I remember those days my friends played GTA 4. I first played it on PC and later on xbox 2. I had a lot of fun and yes i get them almost FREE or very cheap.<p>4. Piracy is wrong. I agree. Im sad for the developers that depends from the big companies like MS and PS. But what is the point to buy a 4 games for the price of the console? And after you must spend money for unnecessary addons and maps that costs no so cheap. This is not my fault that i don&#x27;t buy a games. (almost addons and maps that i wanted are free now or cheaper) And those poor people who buy the game and cant refund it, because they cant test it. I dont mention disk scratches, the whole box with a lot of CDS that no one needs and i cant even sell. Year i know about cloud games.<p>9. The high tech industry never stops and even if you buy a console now, tomorrow someone like Steam will release a new one, so i dont see a difference, Yeah i prefer be the last guy that the mass of sheeps. Like those you see killing people and fighting to buy a new console.<p>6. New features to the old game ? I doubt. 11. A few, even Fable was released on PC.<p>12. A consuming world. Its so sad.<p>ps: i just wanted to share my style of life about console games. My last console was playstation (i sell it in 2001 ) and now im on xbox 2 for 3 years and i will do the same with the new ones.",1386067785

They are probably the most profitable slice, but that is exactly why the biggest players in the market pay top budget to compete about the shares. Because of that understanding of mine, I think you don&#x27;t really get into the &quot;smartphone market&quot; as a start-up, but you get into the embedded systems market. And that is quite possible. You just need to find a slice of the market that is not so highly competed in and you can enter there, e.g., producing small Linux computers for public transportation companies with different, very specific tasks, or building remote controls for model airplanes/quadrocopters. There you get all the know-how of building your own computers, working on your own operating system, finding suppliers and when you are really, really good, you might even come up with a platform of some sort that you can get other developers on to make Apps for, just in the business-to-business area instead of the tough endcustomer market.",1386066634

Sumner showed the EMH predicts exactly this, for a certain distribution of information and returns. How is the real world agreeing with Sumner&#x27;s model evidence against Sumner&#x27;s model being correct?<p><i>What is dangerous about the EMH to me is that it encourages a sort of worship of markets</i><p>The EMH is simply a rule which allows you to turn a statistical distribution of new information into a statistical distribution of price movements. This is what Fama did to get the Nobel prize. A corollary is a &quot;speculators can&#x27;t make money except by chance&quot; theorem, or in it&#x27;s weak form, &quot;technical traders can&#x27;t make money except by chance&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not a &quot;markets are benevolent wizards that solve all the problems&quot; theorem. It&#x27;s not a &quot;no recessions ever occur&quot; theorem. It&#x27;s not a &quot;prices will never change suddenly&quot; theorem - in fact, it proves the opposite of the latter for certain information distributions. If you argue against these latter claims, you are not arguing against the EMH.<p><i>it needs to be proven in the first place</i><p>That&#x27;s not how science works.

Honestly, I think more people should be open about how much they make, how much profit margins their businesses have, etc. because transparency in the long run deflects a lot of questions and problems.<p>Many/most people are basically rational and understand things in somewhat reasonable terms, even if greed is problematic. For example, Bill Gates is worth like $50 billion or whatever. I&#x27;m not rushing to take his money, company, or job.<p>Yet, if I know that I&#x27;m charging $85/hr. for developer consulting when my competition is charging $150/hr. perhaps I&#x27;d be better off adjusting my rates higher. Or, at $250/hr if I&#x27;m already top of market maybe I don&#x27;t have as much room to raise my rates.<p>Knowing that I can make rational decisions about what to charge and so on and people won&#x27;t freak out about that. The way people handle salary negotiations by and large is really bad simply because we are a nation of price takers, not price setters. Thus, the majority takes what they are offered and doesn&#x27;t bat an eye.<p>The handful of people with professional negotiators or who are good negotiators themselves are making far more than everyone else.<p>If you tell your kids how much money you make and explain why, they have a better chance of making the same or more money than you do.",1422590210

8970384,comment,8968915,8968915,0,0,joesmo,,,"This is a well-written piece, much more so than some of the many other articles on the subject I&#x27;ve read in the last couple of years. Still, it provides absolutely no solutions and is rather devoid of ideas. It also seems to ignore basic facts about humanity and society that play out the same regardless of where they take place. Of course a city like San Francisco is currently will be dominated by the rich. Of course the rich will displace the poor and not care about them. Of course they will change things to be closer to their own vision. None of this should be surprising to a seasoned writer like the author. It&#x27;s human nature. Not only that, but it&#x27;s so common that pretty much any city with any history of prosperity has gone through the same cycles. Why then, would San Francisco be an exception? Why would it not happen there? There is no reason to see this as anything but a typical progression.<p>Unfortunately, the author&#x27;s answer is to make sure you get on the right bus. Let&#x27;s take a moment to think about what this means. What he&#x27;s suggesting is that technologists and engineers turn away from the lucrative profession they love and do something that doesn&#x27;t interest them. What he&#x27;s suggesting is that people turn down well-paying salaries to essentially be poor so they can be like the 99%. What he&#x27;s suggesting is just so ludicrous and stupid, it&#x27;d be better if he made no suggestions at all. No one is going to do that.<p>Furthermore, the main reason San Francisco and all of the Valley are still relevant today is technology. I doubt I could find anyone who could claim with a straight face that technology is the reason for prosperity in the area, the influx of people, and general advancement in the area. Simply because the author doesn&#x27;t understand the new things being built in the area, he decries them. This kind of drivel and banter I&#x27;d expect from much less accomplished idiots, not someone as well accomplished and respected as the author.<p>It almost seems at this point that the hate (and that is exactly what it is) of certain people in San Francisco against technologists is a fad, a wave of anger to be jumped upon because it is popular with the stupid masses. It is obviously uninformed, as for every technologist who actually cashed out stock options or in some way got truly rich, there are thousands who are working just as hard as the author and anyone else merely to stay afloat. When you need a $150k salary merely to afford a $2k / month studio or one bedroom apartment, you can hardly be said to be rich. Poor people have always been walked upon by those who are better off, even if slightly so. It&#x27;s happening right now everywhere, yet I do not see these kinds of posts coming from other great cities. This is probably because the diversity (in terms of occupation) in other cities is greater and the idiot masses cannot cling to an idiotic idea of the source of their problems.<p>How about don&#x27;t be a San Francisco asshole either?",1422590016

8970378,comment,8968906,8969706,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Now that I&#x27;m older (27), it&#x27;s time to start a real business. The kind that takes 5 years to build, delivers solid value to customers, makes two or three people independently wealthy, and feeds twenty families.</i>\n<i>But no VC is ever going to fund that.</i><p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that self-improving processes (such as economics and technology) exhibit a &quot;natural growth rate&quot;, that this could even be applied to a person, and that for programmers it&#x27;s about 20-40 percent per year. Compared to anything else, that&#x27;s very high. We can reliably grow a skill base or a company at around that rate, give or take. Of course, starting a new business is risky, but there&#x27;s not strong evidence that it ought to be riskier than starting a new job. Sure, half of small businesses fail within 5 years. But half of all jobs turn to crap in 5 years.<p>At any rate, the mid-risk / mid-growth space that tends toward 20-40% growth and a non-zero but not obscene rate of failure is... as you&#x27;ve noted, severely overlooked. Bank loans require personal liability and are therefore only viable if there&#x27;s nearly a zero chance of failure. VC builds disposable companies that have a 1/10 chance of returning 20x and a 1/100 chance of returning 250x. In the mid-risk / mid-growth space? Nothing. I think part of the problem is that such businesses-- even though they add more value <i>in toto</i> than anything else (they&#x27;re where most open-source software comes from)-- are very difficult to sell.<p>The issue is that VCs are optimizing for their careers rather than their portfolios. You can just as credibly build a portfolio out of mid-risk/mid-growth businesses as these get-rich-quick-or-die gambits. The problem is that you don&#x27;t become a celebrity investor by building a great portfolio, but by having &quot;been in on&quot; the Facebook or Google that comes every few years.",1422589948
8970377,comment,8968722,8968722,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"We got our daughters checking accounts when they were 8. (actually USAA savings accounts that you could write 3 checks a month on) and we set up some auto-deposits for their allowance.<p>Generally the question wasn&#x27;t about how much money we made, rather it was about how money &quot;works&quot;. And why would you save it rather than spend it, and what is debt, and what are luxuries. We also made some of the things that other parents were paying for out of pocket, come out of their allowance. That exercise forces them to choose amongst a couple of things to spend their money on, and they get to experience both good and bad choices. Like spending money on going to a movie versus waiting and buying it as a DVD and having a movie night at home with your friends. Same net expenditure of cash but very different experiences.<p>And we tried to impress upon them the notion of &#x27;current&#x27; money (money in the bank) &#x27;future&#x27; money which was inbound assuming you met the conditions, &#x27;mandatory&#x27; expenses, and &#x27;optional&#x27; expenses.<p>The goal was to show how saving money &quot;pushes&quot; it into the future while taking on debt &quot;pulls&quot; money from the future into the present.<p>I think in general we were reasonably successful. They all knew how to balance a checkbook and make a budget when they got to college. The hard part as a parent is to know that you could make a temporary hardship &quot;go away&quot; but holding back so that your kids can get the experience and feeling of getting past it. The trick is doing it early, so the &#x27;hardship&#x27; is they don&#x27;t have any money left to buy ice cream from the snack shop, rather than something more serious like coming up with enough money to pay first and last month&#x27;s rent on a new place to stay.<p>The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about the article was responding &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; which is always heard as a challenge by my kids, as if they have over stepped their place by asking a question.

8970357,comment,8968906,8969727,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that this is probably right. There&#x27;s <i>some</i> ageism in Silicon Valley, but probably not as much as the VCs are accused of (even if I like to bash the chickenhawks who fund talentless young zeroes like Lucas Duplan and Evan Spiegel). A lot of it, I&#x27;d imagine, is self-selection. At age 50, people who have their shit together don&#x27;t want to deal with the humiliation of participating preferred, obscenely long deliberation periods before a funding decision, and investors who&#x27;ll readily funnel your ideas (and your best people) to a competitor if they change their mind on you. They have other options, whereas the 23-year-olds often don&#x27;t.<p>In fact, that&#x27;s one of the less-often-said (because, applied to individuals, it&#x27;s still bigoted and obnoxious) matters in Silicon Valley. There is an adverse selection when it comes to age. Talented older people tend to have enough experience not to take the typical Silicon Valley deal (especially for startup employees) so what&#x27;s left is a set of people who may be old or talented but aren&#x27;t both (and, of course, most are neither, i.e. young and talentless).<p>Most of the really good, 50+ programmers that I know either want to do real technology (not Snapchat bullshit) or have moved into finance.

I&#x27;m intimately familiar with the &quot;power mods&quot;. We even have our own semi-private subreddit, /r/DefaultMods, where we actually talk about things like this. We discuss how the conspiracy wackos will accuse us of being reptilian shills for Pepsi today, then tomorrow turn around and accuse us of being shills for Coke. Next week we&#x27;re shills for the U.S government, the week after we&#x27;re shills for the KGB or the PRC. This is not an exaggeration. I personally have been accused of being all of those things on numerous occasions over the years. Truth is, I&#x27;m just a welder here in Chicago. Let me tell you how fun it is coming home from a long day at work only to be called a government shill by some teenage neckbeard who thinks aliens did 9/11.<p>At some point, you just get tired of it, ignore it, and you have to laugh at the situation.

Years ago there was a mod who was busted for spamming links to their own stuff. SEO type spam. I think his name was SolInvictus. The admins caught him and shadowbanned his account immediately. There&#x27;s also examples of <i>other</i> mods catching and busting mods for spamming (like the quickmeme guy). These things don&#x27;t go left unchecked. If you think the admins aren&#x27;t paying attention and catching/busting mods, then you&#x27;d be naive. They are, and have been. If there was someone working to systematically undermine their subreddit, the evidence to the admins and even <i>to the other mods</i> would be overwhelming and obvious.<p>By the way, /r/Undelete is populated and run by people from /r/Conspiracy.

If you set your model up to be naive (intentionally or not) and then conclude that the problem is oh-so-difficult instead of concluding - like an engineer would - that we need another conditional check right around here, I&#x27;m not surprised that you are daunted by the problem.<p>You&#x27;re not telling me anything new here.<p>To address your points, if I understood them correctly:<p>First of all the code doesn&#x27;t have to be self-modifying - it can create a new separate version, which is then subject to testing administered by the old version (both the goal function, which designs the new code to spec, and a hard-coded control mechanism as a backup).<p>Secondly, I see no correlation between producing a next iteration of itself and running the test suite. What do you mean here?<p>Thirdly, the AI does not run &quot;arbitrary code&quot;, it runs inside of a sandbox/VM, with tightly controlled inputs and outputs. Same as we think inside of our brains, but act using our bodies, arbitrary code execution would be bodily action. But the AI does not have a &quot;body&quot; at this point, and it cannot interact with the OS.<p>The solution I pointed out cannot not work. Only magic could make it break. And there is no magic.<p>If someone reasoned out that actual _testing_ of the code does not work, and his reasoning is valid, then he must have made some unnecessary assumptions in his model of the computation. If you have any specific paper in mind, please point me to it and I will try to tell you how to fix the toy-model to remove the problem.",1422587693

8970292,comment,8969778,8970099,0,0,breuleux,,,"Could it? Let&#x27;s take a few steps back, here.<p>* You&#x27;re assuming the AI can copy itself, but this is a dubious assumption. As far as I know, <i>none</i> of the AI algorithms at the forefront of research provide a fraction of the data the AI would need to copy itself. Being able to copy yourself is <i>not</i> a property that comes with running on a computer and I&#x27;m quite positive strong AI, when it emerges, will lack this capability to any meaningful extent.<p>Worse yet, data copiability is ultimately a hardware property, and it requires a way to export a snapshot of one&#x27;s internal state all through the surface. That&#x27;s not actually efficient design and one has to account for the possibility that AI would run on hardware that makes copies physically impossible. Locality of information minimizes distance, and this is key to efficiency. The only reason our computers architectures work the way they do is that we need them to, but AI in a production setting is not conventional software and does not need to bend to silly copiability requirements.<p>* You&#x27;re assuming it would have anywhere to copy itself on. If it&#x27;s running on a billion dollars&#x27; worth of hardware, well, it can&#x27;t just copy itself on user grade computers and expect to gain much out of it.<p>I personally tend to believe that churning out new AI brains from scratch states will yield superior results to copying pre-trained AI or to &quot;exponentially self-improving AI&quot;. If nature is to be believed, improvement often requires cycling through clean slates (e.g. birth); software development also suggests that same idea, that sometimes if you want better software you just have to rewrite it.

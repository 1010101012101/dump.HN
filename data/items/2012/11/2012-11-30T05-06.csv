He didn't want the mind of a mathematician to be shackled by Gdel's incompleteness theorems, which means he can't support the idea of an algorithmic mind.  The general acceptance of ChurchTuringDeutsch principle backs him into a corner then, and quantum mechanics offers pretty much the only reasonable escape.  The real problem then is that every time someone pokes a hole in his ideas for how that might work, he just switches it up how he thinks it might work.  He is grasping at an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance with no real reason to do so.<p>What bothers me about all of this is that he writes books about it aimed at the general population, instead of proposing his ideas properly.  Inevitably many of the laymen who casually encounter his ideas will misunderstand his point entirely and mistakenly think that Penrose supports a non-materialistic view of the mind (which of course he does not.  A mind as Penrose envisions it, despite not being algorithmic, is still quite materialistic).<p>Roger Penrose is a brilliant man, but I think this is a case of the Nobel Disease (well, he hasn't received a Nobel prize, but even so).",1354253113

In what world is that a reasonable thing for the police to do? A raid is a thing they should do last, after they already know who they're dealing with and are just sewing up an already strong case against them, not the first thing to do with a suspicious IP address.<p>>In the case of an ISP they don't have to raid them, they just show up with a subpoena and the ISP coughs up the info.<p>They could do the same thing to the operator of the exit node and it would get them the same result as the raid (which is to say really nothing useful) without the harassment, at least in the case that the operator wasn't the perpetrator. Which is the same case for the ISP. Nothing stops criminal ISP employees from responding to a subpoena by destroying the evidence and then fingering some ISP customer known to have open WiFi.<p>>I think that is precisely what they want to do.<p>Then they ought to stop pussyfooting around and actually come right out and propose legislation to that effect. And if it subsequently gets (or already has been) defeated in the legislature or struck down by the courts then they ought to stop pretending it wasn't.",1354251927

Meanwhile, he displays a frightening lack of understanding of the subject matter, and perhaps most disturbingly, in some of his more alarmist articles advocates that computer scientists should step aside and make room for psychologists, philosophers, lawyers, and politicians to sort out these thorny issues at the big boy table.<p>Kurzweil is certainly fair game for legitimate criticism, but Marcus calling Kurzweil a joke is an even big joke in itself.",1354251873

If we can get bluetooth into the mojio without affecting the delivery dates, we intend to include it in the current version - no promises right now though. That way, people have the option to go without a data plan as needed. Also, there's no data plan lock in to mojio so we are looking for ways where people can either add a device to their existing cellular plan or just pay for months where they need it. We are also exploring ways to offset data plan costs. If we can get a sufficient user base, we all get to enjoy the economies of scale.",1354251865

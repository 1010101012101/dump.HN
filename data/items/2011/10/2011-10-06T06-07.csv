In the midst of the overwhelming outpouring of praise, support, and condolences  and amidst my own shock and reminiscing  theres a lingering question that I havent been able to shake: how will the eventual new guard of the technology industry uphold the spirit of innovation and pure, whimsical, adventurous passion for creating new products and experiences that, like a metaphorical torch, is slowly being passed to them?<p>Jobs was a devilishly curious visionary with an unparalleled eye for detail. Will the new minds entering the playing field today be able to summon the insight, creativity, and courage necessary to reach the bar thats been set up for them? Will the new generation of technological innovators be able to rise above their own piddly self-afflictions and nonsensical squats with one another long enough to envision a better world? Will they see, with acquired clarity, exactly how they must sink their claws into those fleeting wisps of imagination long enough to tear them open into a new reality that can be shared with everyone?<p>I sincerely hope this is the case. I hope that with every subtle reminder of our own impermanence comes a torrential reaffirmation to the goal of being in this world to make it, through whatever path we may take, a better place for those who surround us, and for those who will yet reign when we have gone.",1317882984

3079251,comment,3078977,3078977,1,0,partition,,,"Here are some points I'd like to discuss:<p>1. It's clearly not beneficial to ""never settle"" for everything. Some things
   you _do_ settle on, hell you settle on them _out of habit_. Other things,
like your career or love life, is not so clear. But I believe the ""never
settle"" attitude and everything that comes with it is just useful all by
itself, even though you're most likely to end up with a dead end job and die
alone or with someone who hates you. Even so, the linked article is a good
reminder that it's not enough to ""find what you love, then do it""; you have to
not be the ~99% of people who either can't find such a thing (not for lack of
trying), or be stuck doing it badly. Cal Newport poses ""love what you're doing""
as an alternative; but is that just consolation for being a slave in whatever
system you're working in?<p>2. Steve Jobs is known for having a personality cult. Many people on this very
   site  have expressed that they are _unusually_ deeply affected by his death,
it's kind of scary. I say this as someone who is sad that he died and as
someone who uses Apple products on a daily basis. But the hero worship? I think
there's something more to this part. I think most people aren't really engaged
with their lives and actually despise them. The second the slightest _external_
source of inspiration appears, they're engaged and ready to do their life's
work. And this is what Steve Jobs is good at doing, more than anything else:
inspiring people to work harder for his company by essentially exploiting basic
human psychology about feeling effective and belonging to a community. So does
the world really just belong to the people who can get away with the most
social manipulation? Or does this system of social manipulators being at the
top only work in cultures like in America? I just wish there was some better
way of doing things, to be engaged in life but not in service of a
_personality_, either directly or indirectly. Or is that the only real point to
life that has any behavioral consequences?<p>3. Steve Jobs was probably the biggest idea man ever. It is possible to
   categorize people into two groups: those who have the idea and those who do
the implementation. Steve Jobs was good at bringing implementors together to
build around a certain idea. But, often, implementors feel that they don't get
enough credit, either monetarily or socially, for what they do. Yet, from
personal experience, I think it's better if possible to be both at the same
time. Then you know both the problem and solution in intimate detail, and don't
have to deal with people, either manipulating them into doing work for you or
feeling resentful at being manipulated. And for the technical side, there are a
lot of nice force multipliers in the form of programming languages and
libraries. But if everyone wants to be this, then we all end up working alone
or with as few people as possible.  How does one balance the loneliness of
being both the idea guy and implementor against the resentment involved in
being just one of them? Or is there some different perspective I haven't
considered that isn't feel-good bullshit about the members of a team being
""equally"" valuable?",1317882134

3079243,comment,3078128,3078713,6,0,elemenohpee,,,"The species over the individual ""narrative"" exists because it is a fact of evolution.  Life is a pattern of self-replication, and it is at the level of the gene that natural selection works to make this pattern more robust.  The whole concept of having an individual ""over"" a species is so quaintly human. The universe, and the physical processes within it that are life, have no concern for such silly concepts.  To put so much stock into the individual (and such people are always really talking about themselves), is completely egocentric.  We tell ourselves stories about how important and special we are to validate our own existences, and that's fine, it makes some of us feel better.  But we ignore the macro-processes that even allowed our existences at our own peril.  Guess what, with no species, there are no individuals to glorify.<p>>do you also consider it ethically acceptable to kill an individual once he has stopped procreating, since he's no longer relevant to the evolutionary game?<p>The evolutionary game is much more complicated than you imagine it to be.  Humans have evolved to be social animals.  Someone who is too old to procreate can still watch after young, pass knowledge on to them, etc., which increases their fitness.  This is such a fundamental misunderstanding, you have no reason to be so confident in such matters.",1317881698

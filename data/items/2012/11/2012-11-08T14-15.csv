I'm going to transgress my no-HN rule this one time because I did in fact look at HN Pickup very closely and I already have a follow-up post planned in which I was going to mention it.<p>Now the difference between my post and HN Pickup is it's a prediction tool, so it's trying to pin-point precise moments when it's best to post, whereas I'm analyzing past data.<p>So in my post today I talked about the best time to post on average. But, I can also look at my data and say, for example, last Monday from 10 to 11 AM, 30% of submissions reached the frontpage and so it was, in effect, a great time to post.<p>And with that I could look at HN Pickup's past predictions and tell you how accurate they were, ie. at a time when HN Pickup was telling you it's a ""very good time to submit a story"", what percentage of stories actually made it?<p>It so happens that I've actually been able to do that. HN Pickup's creator was kind enough to provide me with a history of predictions for every 15 minutes of a whole week, and after comparing it to observed pickup percentages I found a rather weak correlation (0.25). So it would seem HN Pickup isn't a very effective tool.<p>Also its goal is only to look at frontpage pickups, it doesn't account for the duration of the stay on the frontpage or HN's traffic at the time, which I do in my analysis.",1352386647

I see no reason why my current flatware would become less usable than the kind Dustin is advocating, and if it does, it would take me all of 2 minutes to buy a new set on Amazon.

It probably has a lot to do with the fact that there was not forced integration there in the 60's. Look at a city like Chicago or New York where some of the largest population areas are almost entirely black. Check out Kozol's book Savage Inequalities, it's pretty shocking if you didn't grow up in a large northern city. If you did, then well, you know all about what I'm talking about.<p>There's a lot of elitism from the Northern states still about how they are so progressive but I saw way less racial hostility and more interracial interaction on a daily basis in New Orleans or Atlanta than I do in cities like Chicago or even Saint Louis, a lower midwest town where you can cut the racial tension with a knife.",1352386257

4757953,comment,4756898,4757755,4,0,jrogers65,,,"These points have already been addressed by others but I'll elaborate further.<p>This is simply a different culture and perspective. I know that in business we primarily tend to think of things in terms of the value they provide. The motivation behind OSS projects rarely has anything to do with personal profit. They tend to happen because someone is trying to address a personal need and decides to share their solution with the world, or they just want to create something cool for the sake of it or they're trying to learn a new technology and need something to practice on. It's like charity - you don't advertise the fact that you do it, you just help out and hope that it makes a difference. Personally, I think that people only really try to sell things when there is an expectation of exchange - when something is being given away for free, what is the motivation for marketing it? Why would you waste time talking about the result of doing the things you love to do instead of doing them?<p>I think that this is where the notion of marketing being a force of evil comes from - if something is being sold, it's because someone is trying to convince you to give up something you have. It is inherently selfish. OSS is the opposite - it's selfless - you give without the expectation of getting (yet in real terms you get many orders of magnitude more than you put in - something which just doesn't happen in the business world). It's like a pyramid scheme which actually works.",1352386028

But GNOME developers are not content with being just a middle man that distributions tear apart to take what they want. That's why they are burning a lot of cycles on making GNOME into an OS by itself.",1352383469

Seemingly whenever electronic voting machines make the news the underlying problem is one of gross laziness or incompetence on the part of the manufacturer. It took me hours to clean my brain off the walls when I heard about the Diebold / McAfee mashup. [1]<p>Las Vegas slot machines seem like a perfect archetype (to me, anyway). In trying to look up the security measures I remember from an episode of Modern Marvels I instead ended up with an NY Times opinion piece from 2004 [2] drawing the same conclusion as I. Probably (based on admittedly nothing) the measures cited have become more sophisticated and rigorous 
in the past 8 years.<p>Here are some highlights on slot machine security (as of June 2004):<p>* All machine software past and present are kept on file by the state<p>* Spot checks, spot checks, spot checks. Random and often.<p>* State gaming commissions are constantly looking for new ways to manipulate their machines; the article mentions firing a stun gun at a slot machine (best job ever?)<p>* Six month vetting process for companies and employees wanting produce gambling hardware/software<p>* User disputing the machine's actions has the right to an immediate investigation<p>Note: I am absolutely in favor of maintaining a paper trail for decades regardless of the state of digital solutions.<p>[1]<a href=""http://xkcd.com/463/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/463/</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/opinion/gambling-on-voting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/opinion/gambling-on-voting...</a>",1352383341

6281724,comment,6281073,6281430,1,0,moocowduckquack,,,"I am always happy to learn. I find belief fascinating, especially since I normally don&#x27;t stretch much further with faith than expecting the sun to rise tomorrow, although even that in itself is a bit of a shot in the dark, especially if you try and take a long view.<p>I get what you are saying about the use of gentile in this context. I guess the guy is used to living around non-secular Christians in the US, so is presumably using the word to mean the non-Jewish culture local to him, rather than all non-Jews. I just found it a bit jarring because I was relating it back to my own experiences in the UK, where church going is something of a rarity, even among those who class themselves as Christian.<p>I know very little about Chassidic Jews, indeed I only just realised after looking it up that it is apparently the same thingy as Hasidic, which I also know very little about, though I at least knew the term Hasidic and now also now know one more thing about that, namely that it is apparently the same as Chassidic. I also think it might have something to do with big fluffy hats, and everyone likes big fluffy hats. I should probably seek to expand my knowledge in this area as it is a little bit sparse. :)<p>Back on the article subject, I think that for me one of the best examples of the religious scientist has to be Georges Lematre, who really should have a space telescope named after him at some point, given that he came up with the Hubble constant before Hubble did. His arguments with Pope Pius XII over Pius&#x27; use of Georges&#x27; cosmology to try and provide justification for Catholic theology seem to be astute, especially his point that it is a very bad idea to tie your faith to a scientific theory that may yet be disproved, especially when you are the leader of that faith.<p>I actually had an argument about all this very recently with a mate of mine, who does not study science, but likes to take its side (I am not sure science cares for sides though). He takes the view that science and religion are rationally incompatible and that anyone who says they practice both is lying or mad. On the other hand, I take the view that anyone who says they are completely rational is either lying or mad anyway and that it is far from unusual to be immersed in religion as a faith and science as process. One is to do with your feelings towards the things you cannot discern and the other is a method of discovery for the things that you can.<p>The nearest I get towards spirituality is the distinct feeling that many of the complex archetypes have some deeper pattern and existence, though I strongly suspect that nobody on the planet has ever got close to working out what those patterns actually are or what they represent and I certainly see no reason to regard them as conscious, at least not in any kind of way that we know how to use the term. Then again, perhaps Philip K. Dick is right and some kind of alien-god is communicating with sci-fi authors using beams of light. I would probably bet strongly against that last one though.",1377583128

The parietal lobe will receive input from other lobes as well as the thalamus.<p>The frontal lobe is fairly well described, it basically handles higher level thinking, moral decisions, etc. It receives input from other lobes, the thalamus, and the brain stem.<p>An important take away is that these are really non-specific anatomical regions, the thalamus has ~30 distinct regions all handling different things. The frontal lobe has numerous gyri (regions) with different functions ranging from executive to motor skills.<p>What he&#x27;s saying is pretty bs too. The logical conclusion is not that meditation specifically reduces brain activity, it&#x27;s more that any lack of sensory stimulation will cause brain activity to slow down because less neurons are firing, this can be achieved with other techniques as well, simply staring at a wall will do the same thing.<p>I can post sources if you&#x27;d like but this information (about the compartments of the brain) is very well accepted by those in the medical sciences.",1377582209

This is absolutely correct, at this time he was in limbo, he was not being detained, but he could not leave.  A person cannot simply leave the security area of any airport once they are on the airside but have not satisfactorily completed screening.  Once a person has passed through security, but is not cleared to fly and then chooses to leave, such as Mr. Mukerjee, s/he must be escorted out of the secure area (and usually the terminal).&quot;<p>----------------<p>Deciding if I am detained: a rule of thumb.<p>If I receive word about an urgent emergency, such as my wife being hit by a bus or about to give birth, can I immediately go to the hospital?

It&#x27;s so obviously wrong to imprison someone because some signals indicate they might commit a crime based on who they&#x27;re friends with on Facebook! There&#x27;s a difference between being buddies with a gaggle of career criminals and actually committing (or conspiring to commit) a crime!<p>I think you are trying to create a straw-man here. Imprisoning people even though they haven&#x27;t committed a crime is <i>obviously bad</i>, and I completely agree with that. All I&#x27;m saying is if we were going to do it, then we might as well try to make the predictions as accurate as possible. If your predictions are more accurate fewer &quot;innocent&quot; people will end up in prison (innocent as in, wouldn&#x27;t commit a crime if left out of prison.) In your example, less accurate predictions can literally ruin people&#x27;s lives. Excluding data in that case would be much worse than just for loans.<p>>> If there was a 99% chance of you becoming addicted to them, then you probably shouldn&#x27;t be given pain killers.<p>>If that person has a history of abusing painkillers, yes. If their friends do? C&#x27;mon, you can&#x27;t possibly justify that position.<p>I don&#x27;t see why it matters that the data came from who your friends were. It could just as easily come from blood tests or who your parents are, or all sorts of arbitrary things outside of your control. The point is 99% of people with that feature become addicted to the painkillers and it ruined their lives.<p>If there is a 99% chance of that happening to you, would you take the pain killers? Would you really care where the data came from Would you really ignore information if it was your own life at stake?<p>>I didn&#x27;t argue for equal interest rates for all. It makes sense for interest rates are tied to risk, but it&#x27;s only reasonable to make an assessment of risk based on an individual&#x27;s performance and ability to pay, not their friends&#x27; or peers&#x27; performance.<p>But assessing risk <i>at all</i> puts some people at a disadvantage. It doesn&#x27;t matter where the data came from, if the predictions aren&#x27;t 100% accurate then some percent of people are going to wrongly have a higher interest rate, even if they pay back their loan on time.<p>I think you are thinking of this as an incentive system and not a predicting system. That is it&#x27;s ok to select for features that people can control, like their past history, but not for things that are outside their control. But the point of interest isn&#x27;t to reward or punish people for paying or not paying their previous loans back on time. It&#x27;s just to make up for people that don&#x27;t pay. The riskier you are, the more it costs to make up for all the other high risk people that didn&#x27;t pay.<p>Ideally you just wouldn&#x27;t give out loans to people who wouldn&#x27;t pay them back, and would give loans with no interest to people who would. But usually it falls somewhere in between 0 and 100% probability. The goal isn&#x27;t to reward or punish people, it&#x27;s to predict as accurately as possible.",1377580504

6281575,comment,6280601,6281123,15,0,Lerc,,,"The problem with the PC was a mixture of Attitude and Hardware capability.<p>The Amiga was developed with the knowledge of how people programmed the C64.  That was an entirely different way of doing things to what was going on in the PC space.  The programmers who were getting the most out of the C64 were not thinking in terms of bullet point feature lists but rather how the graphics chips worked to construct the screen on a scanline by scanline basis.   Because the display was constructed over time by the chips the display was a product of the graphics state at the time of each scanline.    That meant triggering interrupts as the beam travelled down the screen allowed for changing of the display state in order to supply as much as possible on each and every scanline. This meant things like instead of 8 sprites onscreen you could have 8 sprites per scanline appearing repeatedly down the screen.  Colours and display modes could change for a wide variety of effects.<p>When the Amiga was being developed, they realised that rather than obscuring the internal features down to a fixed list of modes and capabilities, it would be better to expose what the graphics chips were actually doing.  An example of this is the registers to show what video memory to display actually represent the video memory being displayed,  not just the top of the frame,  the value will increment as the scanline travels down the display.  That means you are required to reset it every vertical blanking period to the top, but enables a vast array of possibilities.  In addition the value that gets added to the pointer to get to the next scanline is also exposed, so you can change the virtual width of the page as well as set it to a negative value to make the display appear upside down.<p>To combat the problem that such a dynamic view of the video state had where you have to reset everything to first positions every frame, the Amiga supplied the Copper, which was a extremely simple processor that was designed to move constants into constant addresses.  The copper could wait for a video beam position then load registers.<p>I said at the start that the difference was a mixture of attitude and hardware capability.  The Amiga excelled because it embraced that attitude.   On the PC Side EGA had some similar features and VGA had an interesting mix by virtue of backwards compatibility blending hardware designed for VGA and EGA together.   It seems clear that the intention of EGA was to provide similar sort of abilities to the C64 (sprites notwithstanding).   For the most part those abilities were ignored,  instead of using capabilities like hardware scrolling programmers tended to just treat the device as a dumb framebuffer.  There were a few exceptions, most notably was John Carmack, who used the hardware registers to make the Commander Keen engine.<p>When the VGA came along the hardware features were still there but the direct use of them was not incorporated into the design the way it was in the Amiga.  For quite a while mode 13h was all things did.  They drew into an offscreen buffer and copied across once complete.  It was exactly the Dumb Frame buffer approach.  Over time people did figure out how to do a few tricks with the combination of registers designed for VGA and registers designed for VGA.  Wolfenstein 3d used ModeX which was using VGA mode13h display output but with EGA style memory addressing to allow page flipping without the entire framebuffer copy.   It also allowed 320x240 (instead of 320x200) and indeed I rather enjoyed playing around with the limits at 400x300 in 256 colours. It was also possible to do hardware scrolling on VGA registers.  A lot of scrolling games used these features. These were the first games to really surpass the Amiga in graphical ability. They needed substantially more CPU to achieve the same result, but at that stage PCs were considerably faster in raw horsepower.",1377580067

I have been using SQL databases which got absolutely horrible query optimizer totally ruining any performance exceptations. I have blogged about that, and I was very frustrated and disappointed with results.<p>Which is faster if id>100 or simply walking database by using series of selects select ... id=101 ... select ... id=102 ... Turns out that the later method is a much faster. Engineers also then suggested that I could optimize the query by using structure select ... id=101 UNION select ... id=102. That&#x27;s simply insane. How ever the query was written, query otpimizer / planner should make sure that all these queries are delivered using similar background process.

Even banks that operate in multiple countries (RBS/Citizens, Santander/Sovereign, HSBC, etc.) basically operate as separate companies in each country.<p>It's expensive and time consuming to comply with so much regulation.  If BankSimple does well, I'm sure they'd be happy to expand internationally, but at this point it's questionable whether the public will gravitate to BankSimple.  If they tried to launch in multiple countries from day 1, they'd be spreading resources very thin dealing with all the different laws.  This way, they can launch, be successful, and expand.<p>In some ways it's like physical businesses.  You wouldn't expect a new fast-food chain to launch with 50,000 stores worldwide, would you?

Stuff like merb-helpers. If you wanted fancy helper methods, you required the merb-helpers gem. If you didn't care, you would not require that and have a slightly more efficient app. Similarly, it didn't have an ORM baked in--you'd use some gem like DataMapper (with an additional merb_datamapper gem that told Merb how to integrate with DataMapper).<p>Padrino seems to have the same setup of a minimal core with lots of modular plugins, but its equivalent to merb-core is sinatra.

I'd put up a site and ask in places like answers.onstartups.com for people to suggest questions for me to ask the speakers and I would mention their startup while video recording the short interviews (""So and so from X startup asks..."").<p>I'm a bootstrapper with a day job and a relatively young product; so while I'm cashflow positive, I'm carefully watching expenses and reinvesting it back into the business. This is why I was making plans for this project. Ultimately, after much back and forth (and discussing it with my wife), I decided that if it was that important for me to go I should just take some of my profit and reinvest it in myself by going (which is an investment in my business). If I took on the project, what I'd gain in money I'd lose in valuable time that I could spend working on my product.<p>So, basically my thought here is that people that win free tickets should earn them in some way that gives back value to the entrepreneurs that can't afford to make it.",1281713316

This contract will end soon (or be reduced to just a few hours per week).<p>This company does client work which they bill at approximately $100/hr  so I know there is a limit to what financially makes sense to them no matter how good my work is.<p>I was thinking of asking for $55/hr this time around but that seems like a huge jump from their point of view when I was earning $36/hr at my last contract with them - just six months ago.<p>I should note that not getting the contract wouldn't be a bad thing.

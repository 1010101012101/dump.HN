229575,comment,229562,229562,0,0,wumi,,,"<i>Everything in computer science is to just write less code. What is the technique for writing less code, and its called subroutines. Everything that has ever been done—object-oriented programs, software as a service—it's about taking this idea of subroutines and being able to use them broadly. When you want to draw a map, you say ""That's hard, a lot of data; I just want to call a subroutine."" Well now you can call Virtual Earth or Google Earth and get back the presentation in this great form. You don't have to think about the data, the format. So we are taking subroutines to this next level and making that simple. Actually debugging the stuff, performance, making it work offline—there is still work being done on this.</i>",1214553174

229573,comment,229523,229523,0,0,DocSavage,,,"There's a quota issue with running this full-text search against large blocks of text.  I originally used the searchable model instead of db.Model for my Bloog app, but I removed it after getting quota errors when Google hosted.  There wasn't a problem with local testing, just when using searchable models in the cloud.",1214553147
229572,comment,229243,229552,0,0,marcus,,,"I'm not entirely sure disabling the personalization effect would have been the wrong thing to do from a user experience point-of-view. Supposed I let a friend browse on my computer, do I really want my search results to be personalized with stuff that interests him/her? What about pages I mis-clicked on or pages that whose link was misleading?<p>I think that requiring a deliberate, conscious vote of confidence from the user for a web-page before actually letting it affect my personalized search results is a very good thing.<p>But from a public relations POV you're probably right, that was the best approach",1214553146

229552,comment,229243,229534,0,0,jamesbrady,,,"Obviously, it was a slightly tongue in cheek comment..<p>However, I would point out that WebMynd IS doing personalised search (totally personalised, in fact). As you point out, updating search indices every time a user visits a page is difficult.\nThe fact that Google have chosen not to tackle this challenge, and we have, is a symptom of their existing methods and stated goal of organising the world's information: not your's.<p>As for your last point, I actually agree with the OP and others that Google's soft touch on this matter was commendable; disabling the effect or blocking the extension outright would have been heavy handed and sent a pretty bad message.",1214551536

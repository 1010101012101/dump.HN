4181493,comment,4179629,4180159,2,0,Symmetry,,,"In theory the Patent Office is supposed to check for prior art, but in practice the Patent Office's budget has remained constant for the last few decades while the number of patents they had to deal with increased exponentially.  At first this resulted in a backlog, but then Congress passed a law saying that they couldn't have a backlog.  So now patents are subject to less and less scrutiny.<p>The unfortunate thing is that our other laws assume that the Patent Office is able to do its job - patents are presumed to be valid unless you go through the legal hoops necessary to invalidate one.  And being in the process of going through those legal hoops isn't a defense when the patent holder sues you for infringement, so there's really little benefit for you to go through them in the first place.",1341060987

3. Just as QOS (quality of service) prioritization was never as effective as just growing bandwidth, the organizations that are clamping down (Twitter, craigslist, ...) should understand that they are really entering a new regime, more akin to the allocation of scarce resources in the real world than the limited-only-by-creativity world of the Internet.

In fact, this has always been one of the biggest challenges of building a fault-tolerant systems. If your master data store lives in one zone then you've got latency issues, but if it lives in multiple zones then you need to find a logical way to shard. You could also replicate across zones and then turn off writes if the zone with the master fails. You could even change masters in that case, but there's risk of data loss there.<p>Anyhow, sorry I don't have a simple answer - I'm not sure a simple answer exists.",1341057993

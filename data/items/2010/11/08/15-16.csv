It makes total sense, and is kind of obvious when you actually consider the design. A car with a big sail on it would only be powered by the wind and probably not exceed the wind speed, because nothing else is driving it. But it was clear that this thing had two power sources: the force of the wind moving it forward, and the force of the prop pushing the air backward (that may sound totally retarded, I know nothing of physics) and propelling itself forward. It's as if people just stopped thinking once they hit the conundrum part of it and purely started trying to form reasons why it could not work, and didn't really question or analyze it with the possibility of them being wrong.",1289231944

I've personally struggled with this issue in our  business development process. When we're meeting with a new client, I get so excited about their project, that I dive into technical details and forget to ask fundamental questions about milestones, schedule, resources, etc. But when I have a checklist in front of me to ensure I ask these questions, I'm too focused on the list and miss important details specific to the project. We've found that a decent compromise is to have at least two people from our side at every  meeting. One is dedicated to scenario-specific quick thinking and the other more mechanically ensures we've covered the fundamentals. It's still not perfect for some of the other reasons you mention, but having only one person in charge of the checklist and having others be checklist-free seems to allow for a good mix of agility while ensuring the critical parts of our process are followed.",1289231633

1882782,comment,1882326,1882326,0,0,pilif,,,"It might be very tempting to just use a REST API and a JS client for your web application. With the _escaped_fragment_ technique, you can even get indexed by Google (I'm not sure whether the other search engines already do this, but Google still is good for 90% of my search referrals, so it's ok for me).<p>The architecture is very clean. And you get a full third-party API ""for free"" instead of having to bolt it on afterwards (and maybe missing some stuff that can only be done in the web client).<p>Not only that, by the statelessness of REST you get really good scalability: Each request is independent of each other request, so you should be able to just add frontend- and backend-servers as you see fit without having to worry about global state.<p>Still, after having done just that (build a web application that is nothing but a JS frontend to a REST API - quite like the new twitter) with <a href=""http://tempalias.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tempalias.com</a> (source is available), I can tell you that it's not all rainbows and unicorns to misuse that saying once more.<p>One thing is Sammy, the client-side framework I used. It's quite easy to get lost in one big heap of application that's very hard to maintain. That is totally my mistake though and with a bit of additional experience and some help of require.js or something, I could fix that.<p>The other thing is UI. People are still used to the browsers page-loading-paradigm. In that case, the browsers themselves provide status update during requests. With AJAX, you'll have to do your own loading indicators and every site does it differently and no site as fine-grained as browsers (Connected, Waiting for reply, Loading... etc).<p>While the granularity of notifications can be fixed (best is to leave it as a single notification, but respond really quickly), you still don't solve the problem that it looks different on every site. This is a general problem of pure-AJAX sites.<p>Newtwitter suffers from this. Lately it's quite slow for me and I'm constantly wondering whether some JS has crashed or whether it is just slow.<p>And finally, sometimes, you have to do really convoluted solutions for problems which could ever-so-easily be solved by just being able to send a few dynamically generated bytes.<p>Of course, you could cave in and chose the impure solution, but I didn't want to which caused me some headache in my case, like not having access to the hostname of the <script src>'d bookmarklet runner script (<a href=""https://github.com/pilif/tempalias/blob/master/public/bookmarklet.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pilif/tempalias/blob/master/public/bookma...</a>) which I now have to pass in on bookmarklet invocation.<p>To be honest though, over time, we'll learn to cope with such issues (and browsers might get a bit better in notifying users about AJAX connections going on) and at that point the advantages could really get into play.<p>After tempalias which was a personal fun-project, we decided to reuse this rest-only architecture for a project my company is currently working on, fully prepared to deal with the issues outlined here because, really, we believe that the benefits might well outweigh the issues.",1289231327

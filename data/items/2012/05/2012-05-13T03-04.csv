I get the impression, living here, that if you want decent remuneration, you need to work for a bank, that being where the money is. And then I expect the job to be significantly less interesting (and experience less valuable in the startup economy) as a result.<p>(I work remotely for a CA company. I just live here; the salary hit is bigger than 20% (I had the corresponding US job offer, H-1B visa etc.) but in my estimation it's worth it for my life preference function.)",1336881598

3965985,comment,3964252,3965827,5,0,tytso,,,"I really don't see it as him being a prima donna.  Some of the deleted comments from the github forom removed the truly trollish comments that he was responding to, such as ""Linus's shit doesn't stink.""<p>My take on it is that there are a very large number of morons out there on the internet, and just as you don't want to hire B or C people in a startup, you don't want morons trying to contribute to an open source project.  B and C people add negative value to a company, not just with their bad ideas and bad code, but in wasting the time of the A people in cleaning up after their bad ideas and bad code.  Why does anyone think it will be any different in an open source project?<p>Hence, if you have someone who has demonstrably acted like an idiot, you really are better off driving them away from the project (fortunately many of these idiots have thin skins, and can be easily driven away).   There is a risk that someone who isn't a moron and who sees someone else who does deserve this treatment might decide to go away, but the chances of this are low, especially if you treat non-idiots well.   Also, just from a probability point of view, especially on the internet, unfortunately the morons vastly out-number the non-morons (see 4chan for proof of this :-), so if you don't do this, you will get swamped.<p>There's also the probability that someone who acts like a moron could be trained how to be less moron-like, but personally, someone who says something like ""Linus's shit doesn't stink"" is probably someone I would treat as a NO HIRE in an interview situation; maybe they could learn, but you don't take those chances when interviewing potential engineers for a startup.   They can learn at some other companies, and try again to go through the interview process later after they've gained some experience.",1336881534

3965982,comment,3963297,3965077,2,0,kamechan,,,"I disagree. The fact that ATT unlocked my Galaxy S2 last November for me without hesitation when I told them I would be out of the country 3 months each year says otherwise. Even last year, with my iPhone4 they wouldn't do this for me. ATT essentially said the same thing they had in 2009, ""we're sorry, if you had any other device but an iPhone we'd be glad to unlock it, but we're prohibited by Apple from doing so...""<p>Maybe Verizon is better for customers who travel abroad often. But ATT showed me they were willing to unlock my non-iPhone without hesitation, so I still blame Apple. And the number of shady iPhone unlocker operations in both London and Tokyo tells me I'm not alone in their aggressive lock-in practices.<p>Maybe Verizon customers get a better deal, and I know unlocked iPhones are available now. Honestly, for the hefty price tag I've never considered unlocked iPhones here in the states. Sim-free plans in the US don't seem to offer the same level of discount that they do elsewhere in the world. Here it seems better to just sign the contract and take the carrier subsidy (something which I fully blame the carriers, not Apple, for).<p>It wasn't until Google started selling the Galaxy Nexus through the Play store for $399 that I even considered buying an unlocked phone. I am still under contract with ATT, but for this price the extra freedom I get is worth it to me. Definitely not gonna pay > $600 for it though.<p>FYI, I do have a number of unlocked phones I carry in other countries. But honestly, wouldn't you rather carry just one phone, the one you use for all your contacts and as a camera, music player, etc ... than having to carry two phones all the time? Kind of a PITA.",1336881390

Look at Obj.magic in Ocaml, or unsafePerformIO in haskell, or ffi/unsafe in Racket.<p>But on the web, you obviously can't tolerate <i>true</i> unsafe back doors. This project gives you something that is ""unsafe"" in that you can read or write to parts of the allocated ""heap"" buffer that you aren't supposed to, but it's not possible for that to violate <i>JavaScript</i>'s safety. And the compiler is generating extremely optimizable code, so it JITs very, very well.<p>On top of that, the fact that it's all implemented on top of a simple API (typed arrays) means that you could compile in a safe mode that does extra checks, or even trap all memory traffic and build valgrind-like diagnostic tools. It's starting out as a virtualized abstract machine, which means it's easy to hook into and provide great development tools.<p>I probably wouldn't reach for this kind of dialect for most purposes.

3965889,comment,3963929,3964373,2,0,zanny,,,"I always think that the best way to combat the unwillingness of the commoner to actively engage in politics is to bring them to the commoner.<p>People behave very differently when comparing communities to even just the town or city they live in.  They behave to their neighbor much differently than someone a 15 minute drive from, and absolutely differently from someone they never see.<p>Given that (in the US at least) approximately 1.5~ in 10 people are public sector workers (I forgot where I got that statistic, but anything > 1 in 50 would suffice), you can easily go full republic and have small communities of 1,000 people (psychological analysis studies seem to lean towards something in the 700 - 1300 range being the maximum number of people any one individual can actively relate to at a human level) who elect a singular representative amongst themselves every year (with no re-elections, and at such a small scale, the politics of campaign finance break down completely - everyone should know each other.)<p>You simply select, emotionally, the person amongst yourselves you feel best represents you individually, and those that want to take the local seat can debate one another in forum with whoever is interested.  The rest can be expected to take sides, but the beauty of this idea is that as long as people remain mobile, you can expect common political interests to attract one another, and as long as you can preserve individual mobility (which is much easier in the modern world) you can expect people to move where the politics suit them.<p>The idea is that you start legislation bottom up rather than top down.  The most fundemental flaw in western politics, such as the controvesry surrounding the Euro, is that hundreds of millions of people can be legislated upon with no suffering or injustice.<p>In terms of scale, have a ""locality"" be 1,000 people, have a ""district"" be 13,000 people (13 representatives), have a ""region"" be 273,000 people (21 representatives), have a ""state"" be 9,009,000 people (33 representatives), and have a national body be the sum of all member states in a nation.  Those numbers are completely arbitrary - the idea is that each level up represents an approximate order of magnitude more people and has more representatives in chorus to represent more diverse viewpoints and require more debate and process.<p>CPGrey has an excellent video series on the means to partition a nation into equally sized parts:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUS9uvYyn3A"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUS9uvYyn3A</a><p>If you do the traditional every 10 year national census and split line partition, you MUST be able to get every district in a margin of 950 - 1050 people, and you can shift the per district number to make sure every region and state has the proper number of component members to match.<p>The real ""shift"" here is you are actively breaking the boundries of artifical borders.  Regions are liquid and determined by how large an area it takes to contain some number of people - naturally, cities will have highly concentrated people in little area and most of the US midwest would be massive regions.<p>It gets rid of the great flaw of the American representational system that gives biased voting power to small states - an arbitrary hold over from when states were independent nations.<p>One important facet is that each member body would elect amongst themselves someone to represent them at higher levels of governance.  That means the national level has representatives beholden to four levels of government equally (civil service is real service, but realistically being a politician should only start being a full time job in these circumstances at the region level).<p>Then, you have a constitutional requisite that for legisilation to be considered by a higher tier of representation (IE, for state law to be considered) a law must be drafted that has been passed in a majority of districts, and that law would require a a majority vote with less than 1/4 disapproval (ie, if 1/4 vote against higher legislation, it does not pass state-wide, or region-wide, or nationwide - it remains applied at the lower tiers).<p>If localities attract mobile people who are like minded, the most successful jurisdictions would attract people, who grow the power base of the region and get entire swathes of the nation under like minded ideologies.  As these areas naturally grow over time, and over decades of change, we can see diverse and disparate political ideologies put their ideas into practice in ""test labs"" of local governments, and then if policy is successful, you will see either other jurisdictions adopt it, or people will migrate to where good governance is practised.<p>The result is that naturally good policy attracts adoption and migration to it, and ideas that fail to benefit a localities citizenry gets rejected - and in the case of majority opinions that harm minorities, a minority can concentrate regionally and prevent adoption of hostile legislation).<p>Given a no tarrif system, and a tax code that requires that national tax be at most as large as the smallest state tax, the smallest state tax be as large as the smallest regional tax, and regional tax being as large as the smallest local tax, then you can keep tax from rapidly inflating out of control (local districts can heavily tax if need be, but national tax policy is forced to the minimum, preventing the current policy in the US of focusing all spending at the national level and making 50% of paid taxes be national tax).<p>The weaknesses in this system are that because disparate ideologies converge, it creates tension between them.  Historically, that leads to war, but we seem to have entered a period where hopefully first world countries won't be declaring war on one another over ideological differences.  We hope.  It is definitely a weakness of this design.<p>Another one is that it requires mobility fundamentally - if you don't agree with your regional politics, you are at the mercy of your peers to implement legislation that can only be overturned with super-majority indifference in majority approved legislation to overturn it.  Hopefully, that would mean that legislation without victims never passes through the system, but I feel it is vulnerable to holes.<p>One important tenant would be that we maintain the ability for higher courts to declare legislation unconstitutional.  A simple bill of global rights, that people are equal, you can not differentiate between people in government based on physical characteristics, fundamental rights to private propery and the resulting privacy, right to freedom of expression, press, religion, etc, right to bear arms - those would all be similarly constitutionally bound concepts and amending that document would require super majority (75%) support of all levels of government (and it would have to be proposed nationally to prevent localities from throwing amendment clutter at everyone in the country).<p>So if you maintain mobility and human rights, have a forced free trade no war inter-state region, and let politics be local and thus emotionally bonded between small groups of people electing single representatives amongst themselves, with no re-elections, and thus no campaigns, and having each layer of government choose a singular representative to maintain their beliefs at each tier above that (who would most likely be moderate) you get ""perfect republic"".  I feel like having digital remote communication allows politicians at each tier to be ""in multiple places at once"" much more effectively, enabling a tiered system like this.<p>... And I just wrote an essay on alternative republics.  Go me?",1336878040

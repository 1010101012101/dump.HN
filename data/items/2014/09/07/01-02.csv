8280078,comment,8279949,8279949,6,0,_delirium,,,"> If you don’t distinguish binge drinking from daily moderate drinking, that would be due to Americans’ addiction-phobia, which causes them to interpret any daily drinking as addictive.<p>This is a quite common attitude in northern Europe as well, or at least in the Nordic countries. In Denmark it&#x27;s highly suspicious to drink alcohol on a weekday (<i>especially</i> at lunch), unless it&#x27;s a holiday, and will lead people to worry about alcoholism. But it&#x27;s completely normal to have 6+ drinks on a weekend evening. Maybe even <i>every</i> weekend evening. You can binge-drink as much as you want, as long as it&#x27;s only Fri-Sat (sometimes Thu). In fact it&#x27;s even sort of expected; <i>not</i> doing so might raise suspicions that you&#x27;re some kind of weird religious person (Mormon? Muslim?). Not sure how this arose, but it seems to be the cultural norm: 14 drinks/wk spread out as 1 each with lunch/dinner every day is seen as alcoholic, but the same 14 drinks/wk spread out as 7 each on Fri/Sat evenings is culturally normal. Whereas in southern Europe the opposite is more often true, at least traditionally, with weekend binge-drinking seen as more questionable than moderate daily drinking.",1410054151

(And, thanks to natural selection, only the hard ones are left. All the easy problems are long extinct.) So why not optimize for this stage? Even if you don&#x27;t end up turning a time/effort profit overall - which is unlikely - you&#x27;ll at least benefit from being under far less stress during what&#x27;s always a fraught period.<p>And for whatever reason, C++ debuggers and debug info formats don&#x27;t seem to be doing a great job of keeping up with the language. Even basic stuff like nested function calls (as easily found with any smart pointer/iterator or array class...) tends not to work very well, to say nothing of single stepping in to std::function, or watching STL types, or using iterators or smart pointers in the watch window. So this necessarily means being a bit conservative about which features you use.<p>(You might have to go through the shipping-a-product process a couple of times before you really internalize this. But once you&#x27;ve learned it, it really does stick.)",1410052851

There&#x27;s no such thing as &#x27;markets&#x27; and it&#x27;s sloppy thinking to believe there is. What we have have is a political system that uses a stylised propaganda framework to propagate and reinforce itself - much as the Church did in the middle ages.<p>Belief in &#x27;markets&#x27; as some kind of metaphysical efficient all-but omniscient decision-making entity is central to that, in some segments of the population - just as belief in Church dogma used to be equally pervasive.<p>The reality from anthropology is that there&#x27;s nothing inevitable about trade or markets at all. Some cultures don&#x27;t have any concept of a &#x27;market&#x27;, or if they do, trade is a peripheral activity, and certainly not used as a tool for centralised decision making.<p>>you can&#x27;t dictate to people what they should want or not want, because they won&#x27;t listen to you.<p>Which is why advertising is such a huge industry, and all governments use propaganda?<p>It&#x27;s actually incredibly easy to dictate what people want.

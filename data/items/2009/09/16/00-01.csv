The problem is that Adobe's dreadful stewardship means they all go to bloatware shit in the end.<p>Flash may have been a great product, but it certainly isn't anymore. And its ubiquity simply shows the popularity of things people have done with it -- video being the big driver -- and doesn't prove that it is ""great"", any more than the number of Windows seats prove its greatness.<p>The Flash runtime on the Mac is so poor that even their Flash PR-blogger suggests you get a flashblocker (there are also rumours that ClickToFlash was originally an inside job -- thanks for taking pity on us!) to deal with it. All the while he protests that Adobe doesn't need to do anything to improve it to deal with the challenges of HTML 5, because only ""minority"" browser vendors care about that, and IE will always be king.

But I may be wrong about that.  I don't know much about them, actually.<p>The graphic Adobe provided led me to believe that they view this as fitting analytics into Adobe's existing content workflow, which includes Flash/Flex/Air/whatever, and not a lot of standards-based approaches to the web (they work with standards, too, but it always seems an after-thought and an also-ran technology).  So, if they envision this as a way to further lock companies into the Adobe web deployment silo, which is what it seems like to me, then I think it's a bad move...because it's betting against open standards and consumer freedoms winning in the end, and I always consider that a suckers bet.<p><i>Can you elaborate? Stock is at a relative low. Omniture's revenue is about 1/6 of sale price (they are not profitable, but they are growing).</i><p>They're a service business, as you noted, and a service business that isn't profitable (but growing) seems like the old, ""We're losing money on every sale, but we'll make it up in volume!"", philosophy.  If growth doesn't result in increased efficiency, as it rarely does to a significant degree, in a service-based business, it seems like growth isn't a useful metric.<p>I wouldn't think this would be a good fit for Adobe <i>because</i> their value to the market is product-based, and this gives them a (currently money-losing) service-focused business to manage.<p>But, as I said, I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I just choked a bit on the 1.8 billion number for a company that I can't imagine being worth that much (and it is entirely plausible that I'm showing a lack of imagination).",1253062339

Without specializing in something, you will never be the best/at the top of your field. You need something to be good at, something to be better than everyone else at.<p>* Something else. I think the best thing that ever happened to me was pursuing a degree in Statistics in college (as opposed to Computer Science, which I started in). I ended up in it a rather un-panned method, and it has influenced me far more than anything else I have done. Given the chance, I would recommend any person, particularly those who want to get into start-ups, to go get a degree, but in something that interests them, not in something they think will be useful.<p>* Equal parts Confidence, Stubbornness, and Genius, with a dash of Charisma. Without that, you can have the best idea in the world, but never make it, or be able to sell it.",1253060253

FutureSplash Animator (oh, those were the days) was a revolutionary product that blew the crap out of the only other web multimedia solution at the time (which was Shockwave). It was vector based (truly revolutionary in 1996!), small, fast even on computers of the time. Even after the acquisition by Macromedia, the introduction of simple video streaming to Flash completely changed the economics and hence the popularity of online video, which produced YouTube, Hulu, and other game-changer online companies.<p>Since the second acquisition (by Adobe), Flash has been buried under the mountain of bullshit you've mentioned, but Flash was and is a great product, as evidenced by its ubiquity -- 98% of desktops in the world have Flash installed, more than have Microsoft Windows. Pretty amazing stuff.",1253060115

Are they going to charge less for dedicated than for virtual hosts?  You can get a server with 8 cores and 16Gib ram for under $2K from places like serversdirect.com, or building from parts.  I build from parts, and generally end up paying $1500 for a 32GiB ram box.   co-location is another $150/month or so.  (my costs are closer to $75/month for a dual-socket box, but I have two full racks)<p>Unless you screwed up assembling the thing, the chances of something other than a drive failing are pretty small.   I mean, not zero;  don't count on hardware... I'm just saying, even if you have to get a $150/hr guy in to fix your bad hardware, that just doesn't happen very often.  way less than once per server.  Way less than once per every 10 servers (assuming you didn't screw up the assembly, and that you rotate out the server after 3 years.)<p>So yeah, there are many situations where it makes sense to rent, especially if you can't use 8 cores/ 32GiB ram of capacity.  but if you use a whole server (32GiB ram/8 core;  go virtual until you need that capacity, I say.) the cost advantages of owning hardware yourself are overwhelming.  Sure, there are reasons to rent... I'm just saying, owning ends up costing you a /lot/ less money.",1253060075

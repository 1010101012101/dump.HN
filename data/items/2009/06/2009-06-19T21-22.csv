665861,comment,665755,665815,0,0,youngian,,,"Here's how I read that statement:
IE6 and IE7 were only the ""best IE yet"" at release due to how truly awful each previous incarnation was. IE7 is a lousy browser, so calling it the ""best IE yet"" at the time was like saying that chewing on tinfoil is more fun than chewing on rusty razor blades. It might be an accurate statement, but it doesn't mean you're enjoying that tinfoil. IE8, on the other hand, actually feels like a step (admittedly a smallish step) in the right direction.<p>Similarly, Windows 7 is actually more _usable_ than previous Windows. Vista was shinier than XP, and had a couple nice features like integrated search, but there's a reason Dell had to start selling machines with XP licenses again.<p>I think the author intended the statement to be something like this: that Windows 7 and IE8 actually _deserve_ the title of ""best ___ yet.""",1245448601

Well, for starters, we have a nationwide network of both chapter drivers doing shows and members interested in watching movies.

665849,comment,665741,665813,0,0,pmjordan,,,"After reading the main article and the link you provided, my interpretation/understanding is:<p>* The idea is to trick the web server into keeping a connection open and waiting for data, e.g. by keeping on sending pointless headers, not sending enough (< content-length bytes of) data in the body, etc. Unlike a SYN flood or so, this doesn't require much traffic from the attacker.<p>* The reason this works is that apache has a limit of one thread or process per active connection, and there is typically an upper bound on<p>* The way to fix this once and for all in apache et al would be to handle socket I/O asynchronously, thus lifting the 1:1 ratio of connections to threads/processes.<p>Is that accurate? I'm mostly curious so that I can try to avoid any such pitfalls in any server software I might write.<p>One way to fix this in apache without breaking too many existing modules and extensions might be to use fibers to hide the asynchronicity and schedule them in the ""blocking"" I/O functions which would actually use non-blocking I/O underneath. (I don't actually know the apache architecture, so I might be wrong about the blocking I/O)",1245448100

665841,comment,665052,665804,0,0,ars,,,"Javascript is not totally sane:<p><pre><code>  '\t\r\n' == 0 --> true
</code></pre>
And not transitive:<p><pre><code>  ""false"" == ""0"" --> false
  ""0"" == 0 --> true

  false == ""false"" --> false
</code></pre>
It's basically impossible to make a loosely typed equality perfect.<p>PHP is much more strict about the rules used when doing the comparison, javascript is more loose. It tries to guess.<p>When comparing a string to a number, if the string looks like a number it's converted to one. But if it doesn't, then instead the number get converted to a string.<p>This works well most of the time - but not always, since it can surprise you. PHP is more strict, so it doesn't work as often, but it fails more consistently, so it's easier to find the problem.<p>Another example:<p><pre><code>  ""1"" == ""01"" --> false
  ""01"" == 1 --> true
  1 == ""1"" --> true</code></pre>",1245447267

330468,comment,330291,330291,0,0,indylist,,,"I've been waiting for Apple to implement this themselves- it always seemed odd that they didn't. Especially back in the 'web apps are the iPhone API' days.<p>It's nice to see this hole closed, although still relying on the app store for distribution is a shortcoming. An even better option would be a third party browser that could support these extensions for any site, but then again, that would be duplicating Apple's built in functionality, and chances are they wouldn't approve the app for inclusion in the store.",1223841526
330467,comment,330139,330392,0,0,startingup,,,"None of the figures (debt to GDP, savings rate etc) I cited are controversial. Lots of people have been talking about those figures for many, many years, that's why I left out citations. Just to cite a recent example, the Sequoia presentation has all of these and more, in gory detail. Of course, you can interpret that data whichever way you want, but the data itself is clear.<p>You can find the presentation, for example, at: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/eldon/sequoia-capital-on-startups-and-the-economic-downturn-presentation?type=powerpoint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/eldon/sequoia-capital-on-startups-...</a><p>A couple of common objections to my line of argument are:<p>a) debt to GDP is just an accounting number or paper (""we owe it to ourselves"" - in a global sense) and we can adjust that without much consequence to the real world.<p>Response: Given that current incomes are not able to service the debt, the debt needs to be written down. As that debt gets written down (for example, if GM or Ford were to file for bankruptcy), there will be economic consequences like lay-offs. Those economic consequences are another way of saying that the projects that the debt financed were unviable and therefore have to be terminated.<p>Those layoffs will cause further debt erosion - those laid-off workers default on their credit card payments, for example. So there are <i>real</i> economic effects to that accounting fiction. Even the dot-com bubble needed several years to be worked out. This is a far bigger bubble.<p>b) The US savings rate is underestimated.<p>The savings rate underestimation argument actually used to cite rising asset values, particularly housing, not being counted in savings. Falling asset values kills that argument.",1223841352
330466,comment,330362,330463,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The author was referring to total household debt (including mortgages, credit cards, and car loans), not just the Federal debt.  That total is significantly more than $10T.<p>Granted, he's still wrong, because he doesn't take into account who the debt is owed to.  If you have a $200k mortgage, that $200k is your debt but some bank's asset - most of which are U.S. corporations.  It all cancels out, and what you're left with is the U.S. debt held by foreign citizens, governments, and corporations.  Which is worrisome, but historically, when major military powers have owed large sums to foreign creditors, they just declare war on the foreign powers and then declare that all debts owned by enemy combatants are null and void.",1223841025

Thanks for that succinct explanation of the real world connection to all this financial destruction.<p>A whole lot of capital and labor needs to be repurposed, and it is going to hurt, even without the political system making things worse.

330457,comment,330139,330285,0,0,mattchew,,,"One way to look at the current crisis is that a whole lot of long term plans, once thought to be sensible, were abruptly shown to be unworkable.<p>These plans included actual inventories, lines of production, houses and other buildings, and actual people working at actual jobs to support all of these.<p>Those plans now have to be scrapped.  That means inventories wasted, lines of production shut down, and people fired.  We cannot just keep building more and more houses as if nothing has changed.<p>Shutting down production lines and firing people is a real destruction of wealth.<p>This destruction will have secondary and tertiary effects.  We've already seen how the cascade works in the stock market.  Over the next year (or more) you will see it in production and employment levels.<p>> The crash of the financial markets has not reduced the production capacity of any of these goods or services.<p>It has, because a considerable fraction of that productive capacity was allocated based on false assumptions.<p>We have to reallocate that productive capacity to new purposes.  We don't yet know exactly what capital and labor needs repurposed, or to what new purposes.  The way we find that out is by businesses contracting or going bankrupt and people being thrown out of work.  Eventually, other businesses will expand, new ones will start up, and people will find new jobs.  It will take a while, and in the meantime, it is going to hurt.",1223839592

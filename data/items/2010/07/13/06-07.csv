I don't think that it's a whole lot of performance overhead and it does let you switch when you realize it's time to.<p>Overall, you may also want to use orm for sakes of interchangeability of your SQL as well, and it certainly gives you advantages.<p>Im working on a project that involves no orm and uses oracle as a primary data store. Though I don't want to install oracle On my machine but repository idea built-in to project doesn't let me use postgre for development. And yet schema creation involves varchar2 that's simply inaccessible in postgre. Its quite easy to fix but I'd expect to have some kind of a fallback....<p>In any case, it's a good point that key-value storages are not for every problem, but that's quite obvious. someone said that every time you say ""nosql"", a kitten dies. so, careful there.",1279004074

It's not as if we're sending along semi-trailers loaded with a single tube of toothpaste - those things are packed to the brim with what other people have ordered.<p>The way I look at it is this: with a brick and mortar store you only have the efficient, bulk transport all the way up until the retail endpoint. Everything after that is somewhere between ludicrously wasteful, and terrifyingly wasteful. Even then, we can fulfill entire cities from a single (or very few) warehouses in an online shopping context, but retail stores require many more locations, each carrying a smaller amount of stock (much of which will remain unsold to be returned elsewhere), and situated according to the whims of the consumer, not the efficiency of distribution.<p>You driving to the store for your toothpaste may seem like a negligible amount of pollution contribution - but multiply that by everyone in your entire city, and suddenly hauling a fleet of semi trailers would seem downright clean in comparison.<p>With online shopping the shipping process remains bulk from the supplier all the way to your door - there is no SUV with a single passenger hauling 3 bags of groceries - that UPS truck is packed to the brim <i>and</i> has a highly optimized route.

The OP seems to fall into the camp that, if ORM can't replicate <i>everything</i> that you would do in native SQL, then therefore ORM is bad.  Which is absolute nonsense of course.<p>I just don't see how the pure SQL people and ORM people are philosophical opponents, other than how ORM tools make dealing with SQL (which is an awesome, proven technology) so much easier, I suppose it could theoretically be a threat to their livelihood.  The way I see it, they are partners in the same cause.<p>I'm the same as you, I write applications that need to store and interact with data.  The difference between using an ORM or not is like light and day, and for me, this constitutes 90% of my work. Certainly, there are situations where it is just common sense to drop down to raw SQL (and if your ORM doesn't support this, you are screwed), but people like the OP seem to subscribe to the ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" philosophy of life....if you can find a single problem with a solution, throw the whole thing out.<p>This is one of those arguments that will never, ever go away.

1510528,comment,1509512,1509601,0,0,grellas,,,"An excellent point on laches. Let me take this occasion to contrast this with the ConnectU case and, by the way, to offer up a <i>mea culpa</i> for even having posted this thing on HN (well, I guess it does qualify as an item of interest to hackers but the merits of it are something else again, as I will explain here).<p>First, one can take a look at the real thing, that is, a truly scary case against Mr. Zuckerburg that might have a huge impact on Facebook and its shareholders - and that is the action by the ConnectU founders by which highly prestigious lawyers are mounting a first-class challenge to the settlement agreement that was entered into a few years back in an attempt to settle lawsuits going back to 2004. Here is a link to a recent piece on that dispute, together with a detailed comment by me describing it and its implications: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379</a>. I personally don't think that the ConnectU action is likely to prove to have merit but, and this is key, it poses such huge risks to Facebook as a company that the pressures to settle it will be very large.<p>The Ceglia action, in contrast, poses no serious risk to Facebook or to Mr. Zuckerburg. Here are some reasons why:<p>1. The contract was breached, if at all, at least six or seven years ago. The complaint says so right on its face, and this undoubtedly means that all claims are barred at this point by the applicable statutes of limitations. There are cases where a statute of limitations is ""tolled"" (i.e., doesn't yet begin to run) but these need to be specifically alleged in order to apply and they are not. Thus, on their face, all these claims would appear to be time-barred.<p>2. Laches also could apply insofar as the claims might be said to be so-called ""equitable"" claims as opposed to mere claims for damages. Here the complaint purports to ask for so-called ""declaratory relief,"" which is an equitable claim. An equitable claims basically invokes the extraordinary power of the court to issue decrees and judgments beyond simply ordering that a money award be paid. In this case, the claimant would in essence be asking the court to force Facebook to issue mountains of additional stock to him to satisfy his claim that he is entitled to 84% of the ownership of the company. The doctrine of laches can serve to bar the grant of any such equitable relief. Laches is a technical doctrine that in effect enables a court to use its discretion to deny relief to a party who has acted inequitably. With laches, this  is tied to delay in asserting one's rights but, in contrast to a statute of limitations, it is not tied to the lapse of any specific time period. With laches, a court will deny equitable relief to any party who knows the facts relating to his injury and to his claims (and who is not prevented or hindered from filing suit), and yet waits an unreasonable time before filing suit such that other parties are prejudiced by delay, Here, of course, one has all sorts of events to point to by which Facebook and its shareholders have issued and transferred stock in the company while this claimant has slept on his alleged right to assert his ownership claim. This would obviously make it grossly unjust for a court to do any action to prejudice the ownership rights of such persons in order to uphold claims that could have been asserted long ago. In the ConnectU case, despicable as the plaintiffs' conduct might have been in some respects, no one can ever accuse them of sleeping on their rights - all concerned have been acutely aware that, should they prevail with their claims, the Facebook IP might be at risk and so there is no equitable bar to their claims (should such claims ever prove to be valid). In contrast, Mr. Ceglia does not even attempt to explain his delay or why he failed to act with diligence.<p>3. The real tip-off here, though, lies in the nature of the TRO application brought in the state court. A TRO is an extraordinary remedy enforceable by contempt, meaning that a party can actually be jailed for violating it. <i>It is a very serious remedy that a court does not enter lightly.</i> Moreover, at absolute minimum, when a TRO is sought, the party applying for it is required under court rules to tell the adverse party that an application for such relief will be made and give such adverse party at least 24 hours notice to enable such party to appear to contest it. Here, <i>no notice whatever</i> was given to Facebook or to Mr. Zuckerburg of the application. Anyone who is a lawyer will immediately recognize just how outrageous this is - this virtually never happens and, when it does, court rules require a very detailed explanation of why the giving of notice should not be required (e.g., that a party might run off with assets). Here, nothing whatever was set forth to justify the failure to give notice, meaning that this application was wildly out of bounds.<p>4. A TRO also is a specific <i>temporary</i> remedy aimed at preventing irreparable harm from happening to a party pending a hearing on such party's application for a preliminary injunction. A preliminary injunction hearing, usually held within a few weeks after a case is filed, is a form of interim relief designed to prevent a party from taking certain actions until the merits of the case can be decided at trial. Since trial usually takes a year or more to happen, the tandem remedies of TRO/preliminary injunction are designed in theory to allow a court to enter interim injunctive orders covering the entire pretrial period of a case. Since the full merits of a case can't be determined at these early stages, the standards for granting such interim injunctive relief turn on whether a party can make a detailed showing that it is likely to win the case on the merits and that it will be irreparable harmed in the meantime should it have to wait until trial to obtain the relevant injunctive relief. Thus, any TRO/preliminary injunction application will consist of detailed affidavits setting forth the facts showing why the party will likely prevail on the merits and also the facts showing why it will be irreparably harmed if the requested relief is not granted. In this case, the showing made by the applicant had none of this. In essence, the applicant merely said that he had been allegedly wronged and that the other parties should be enjoined from transferring any stock or assets of Facebook until he could prove his claims at trial.<p>5. This, however, is where the bonehead stuff comes in. A TRO is designed solely to cover the limited time period between the filing of the complaint initiating the case and the time of the hearing on the preliminary injunction - this is typically a 15-day period or so. Thus, TROs are almost universally denied because, to get a TRO, a party must show that it will be <i>irreparably</i> harmed unless it gets the court to block all further wrongful acts by the other parties over the next 15 days. This, of course, is an absurdity here: it means that this claimant is saying that, having waited seven years, he will be harmed in a way that is extraordinary unless the court intervenes to block Facebook stock sales, etc. for a two-week period pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction. Of course, if such irreparable harm would happen in the next two weeks, why the hell did he wait seven years to act in the first place. The other bonehead items: (a) asking for a <i>permanent</i> injunction at the time of the hearing on the <i>preliminary</i> injunction application (an absurdity, since a permanent injunction can only be issued after a full trial on the merits); (b) asking that the court order a full accounting in connection with the preliminary injunction hearing (a comparable absurdity, since this too is a remedy that is only possible after a full trial).<p>6. Given all the above, it makes no sense that a judge would have granted this TRO without a proper showing of any kind, where the remedies sought at the preliminary injunction hearing were wholly unauthorized by law, and where obvious statutes of limitations and laches problems loomed over the claims (strongly suggesting that there was no likelihood that this claimant could ever prevail on the merits of the claims at trial). Thus, the only logical conclusion is that the judge was in some small town and was not focused in any way on the relevant legal standards (this sort of thing is <i>way below</i> minimum standards and is the kind of thing that even a first-year law student would easily be able to evaluate). It appears that this is what happened here.<p>7. Once Facebook got notice of the claim, it immediately removed the lawsuit to federal court and brought a motion to dissolve the TRO. Chances of getting this TRO dissolved: 100%. The case is flaky and the entry of the TRO was flaky. There is <i>zero</i> chance that it will be sustained or (in my view) that this case will cause Facebook or Mr. Zuckerburg any significant legal trouble either now or later. This is a lightweight case that is ultimately going nowhere.",1279001250

However, they almost always bring a lot of clout and usually involve learning a subject at a deeper level than you normally would. So, usually it's worthwhile to write at least one if you have the opportunity.<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind:<p>1. Books often challenge an author's discipline and then become extremely painful exercises. With most programming you get regular feedback. Many authors go months without getting any feedback at all. So, be aware, time management is important.<p>2. In my opinion, longevity of the information you're writing about matters more than anything. The primary benefit of writing a technical book is getting to claim to be an expert for awhile (that and helping people). If you were to write a Javascript book in the O'Reilly cookbook style (how to find the length of an array, etc.) you could expect to be a javascript expert for many years. If you were to write an Android Application Development book, you might only have a year. I published my book (a pocket reference for O'Reilly) in 2003 and landed my biggest client this year because the technical decision maker had a copy on his desk. That's why I'm a believer in evergreen topics.<p>3. Lucrative means $50-100k. I have a friend who tells a story about how the car he drives came from his first royalty check, $42k. That's a lot, right? Maybe he made $100k on that book for three months of work. But it's not repeatable. The way that it became lucrative for him is that he parlayed that into high dollar consulting and eventually CTO of a well funded database startup. If you're savvy about picking a topic with some interest, you should expect to make $10-20k lifetime. That's less than you'd make in salary.<p>4. Get co-authors.

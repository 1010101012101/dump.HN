5410241,comment,5409914,5410069,3,0,RobSpectre,,,"Great question Josh.  Big benefit here is being able to keep your voice application logic in your own code instead of in Asterisk.  Often we find in business telephony applications, the really important information you want to get to and from the user isn't in the phone server, but in the CRM app or help desk app or support app that the phone server is trying to get to and from the user.  The closer data like account numbers or service tags or support tickets is to the logic that directs your IVR tree or call queue, the easier it is to build experiences that delight users.  Siloed telephony and business software manifest themselves in ugly ways like having to repeat information to multiple agents or waiting on hold while your account information is retrieved.<p>We think if the code that makes your customers happy and the code that makes your phones ring can finally live in the same place, some pretty magical stuff can happen.",1363812958

Images of people having fun and drinking Coke, which are then distributed through every media known to man. Three billion just for Coke = fun, popular. Think about that for a minute, and you'll recognize it's almost impossible to comprehend how intimate symbols really are, how they turn something intangible into something real that you can buy.<p>Now let's look at the diamond. In my opinion there is only one association that actually drives the purchase. Diamond = marriage. And not just marriage. The loving side of marriage, the tender and personal one as opposed to the banal legal one symbolized by a certificate or the familial one symbolized by the ceremony.<p>You can come up with a story as to why you don't have one, but there always must be a story.

It's what you as a reporter need to do to serve your reader best  period.<p>You have to distinguish between reporters who should be out in the field  political and crime beat reporters, for example  and those whose field actually is their desk. There's no reason for many of the reporters at Mashable and TechCrunch to leave their desks. They're writing about hardware and software. They need to be there to test and use the tools in order to write about them. How is visiting a grieving mother going to help with that?<p>There's something else about technology reporting that people should keep in mind before they criticize: The industry is secretive. Except when you have access to inside, quasi-legal/ethical/reliable information sources, you as a reporter have no way of knowing the news until the company or researcher is ready to reveal it to you. That usually coincides with a press release, but that doesn't mean the work is merely regurgitating a press release. Every story means learning the tool; having the ability to learn quickly is not a negative. It's the result of an inquisitive, focused, interested mind capable of grasping the arcane and translating that into something meaningful for people who are counting on you to help them get their work done.<p>I'm a tech reporter and a subject matter expert in a few specialized areas. I would put my expertise against anybody in my field, and I'm certainly more knowledgeable than the PR people who put out corporate releases rife with technical inaccuracies. I didn't get this way by chatting up CEOs or interviewing the man on the street. I got this way by setting up my autism station and plugging away at it day and night, weekday and weekend, holiday or no holiday, asking questions of engineers when I stumble, then writing about what I learned in a way that people can understand.<p>My readers benefit from that.

However, I believe that it makes more sense to simply agree that the documentation could be better and possibly even invite Delvarworld to jump on IRC or discuss on the forums ways he thought the docs could be improved instead of ignoring him.<p>In my mind I saw it as someone explaining the steps they took to try something and outlining the various ways they failed in that endeavor and then you, a core contributor, coming down to essentially tell him to fuck off, it wasn't worth your time.

The Golden Hour is one of those concepts in medicine that everyone praises (it originated @ Marylans Shock Trauma center if I recall), but it actually does not have an evidentiary basis.<p>There are 3 categories of trauma patient, people who will die no matter what you do (hole in the aorta), people who will live no matter what you do (fractured extremities), and people where the outcome may be influenced by treatment in the field. My non-evidence based opinion is that the people in this 3rd population who have the types of injuries that would benefit from this foam will be rather limited. The aorta, inferior vena cava, kidneys and parts of the duodenum, pancreas and rectum are all retroperitoneal. Thus, filling the peritoneal cavity with foam <i>could</i> put pressure on bleeding structures located in the retroperitoneal space, but I would be skeptical. So this foam is for people who have dont have large hemorrhage of anything in retroperitoneal space and dont have a fatal mesenteric, liver, or spleen injury, but do have an injury to one of these structures that is sufficiently bad to warrant the foam. The risk of exposing patients with liver and spleen lacerations that could have been managed non-operatively (again, not a surgeon by any stretch but I believe this is a growing trend) to an unnecessary laparotomy isnt mentioned.<p>The target audience for this item is going to be armed forces medics with (in my opinion) highly variable clinical skills.

It's easier for YC companies to raise funding (allowing them to pay market salary and benefits faster) and they have been vetted so we can assume the idea and team have a better shot at success. If you want to work in startups, working for a YC company is a better risk vs reward scenario as compared to a non-YC company. In regards to the post, just ask for more equity in scenario 1.

I did not see one article asking if someone's Outlook for Windows contacts had ever been uploaded.  It was a stupid move for the startup, but given the history of PCs, it seems like something post-PC product managers would overlook.  People seem to want to share everything, but have control over privacy.  Adding to that, I am sure a push to make absolutely sure security measures (remote wipe, find my phone) cannot be disabled by a thief.  All this gets us secure, locked devices, because it is easier than having your C-level executive be lectured to by some member of Congress's committee.<p>So, I would expect to see less and less of people in the industry who got into like me with and Atari 400.  There are certainly no modern day version of the C64, Sinclair Z80, or TI-99/4a (no, Raspberry Pi isn't even close).<p>iOS provides great software to start every career but the one that makes it sing.",1363810064

So naming conventions that might make sense to you don't apply to the average user.<p>It's called ""wp-content"" because that's where all personal, custom stuff goes--all your photos, plugins, etc.  (Not including your MySQL data.)

The other directories, more or less, are owned by the core developers and Automattic.<p>Since 2004 when I started blogging, I've watched WordPress add so many bells and whistles.  It's the opposite of what made it appealing in the first place, an elegant ""poem"" of an application.

Sometimes your content expands such that WordPress can't deal with it.  WordPress is a one-size-fits-all solution and that's ultimately limiting.

We can usually get 5 or 10 business days of back and forth on our customers' behalf before the takedown mills manage to generate a fully compliant notice.<p>And if this notice really was just about a review mentioning a product by name, we would have ignored it or at the very least asked the sender to explain under penalty of perjury why the content was not protected under fair use.<p>Disclaimer: We're a registered hosting provider under the DMCA.",1363809689

Conversely, a nonsense name gives you more latitude (and likely unique Google-mojo) but now you have to teach people what it means,<p>- If a name isn't obviously  <i>interfering</i> with what you're doing then it's probably not that big a deal while you're validating an idea, but of course if things don't take off you're going to wonder  how it might have been different if you had a catchy clever name :)",1363809673

What I'm talking about is being fast enough that even auto complete can barely keep up, combined with a depth of knowledge that allows you to make the wise strategic choices that cut out huge swaths of time and typing. Like the other day this other developer and I were trying to reorder columns of data and sort them by multiple groupings of aggregates in .NET. We were twenty minutes into what would have been hours of effort before I remembered reading about DataTables, which are in memory databases in .NET. We had our problem solved in a few minutes. No auto complete would have told me that, just careful, deliberate study.",1363809657

Since we've implemented it, we haven't had to do that yet -- it's caught all manner of issues large and small that we're glad never made it into production.<p>The 10 minutes is to run the full suite of tests. In the case of an emergency, if we needed to get code out and wanted to bypass tests (e.g. reverting to an earlier version), we could run our deploy task manually, in parallel on all machines, and be done in about 30 seconds. This is obviously a nuclear option that we'd hope to never have to use, but if we were reverting to known-good code after a botched deploy, it might be our best bet.<p>This process is a safety net. If we want to work without a net, of course we have more options -- this is the tradeoff that we've made.<p>EDIT: small clarification",1363809604

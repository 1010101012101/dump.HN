43844,comment,43686,43820,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Regarding your first point, you're probably right, and I likely overstepped my ideas and/or didn't express them completely. I also had another consideration that I didn't express in my first comment. The Africans that ended up as slaves in America were the ones who had been defeated in tribal battles. On average, I would say they would likely be less intelligent than those who win battles or avoid them altogether.<p>Regarding intelligence of agriculture vs. hunting, I would argue that hunting may require more skill, but in agriculture, intelligence (and creativity) has a greater reward (than in hunting).  That is, it is very difficult to automate tasks in hunting (beyond things like inventing guns, which they obviously hadn't done), but agriculture has been steadily getting more efficient with creative inventions from iron tools to plows to the cotton gin and so on.  Hunters today still use very similar methods to ancient times.  For that reason, I believe that an agricultural society selects more strongly for creative thinking, while a hunting society selects for physical skill and quick thinking. The creativity required to change society in order to accommodate more crowded conditions also undoubtedly requires intelligence. Anyways, enough of that...<p>I do agree with you that there is likely a small amount of bias in tests like these, and your example is a good one.  Another I have heard was about a question which involved the ""knowledge"" that lemons are yellow.  In Latin America, however, lemons are more often green, obviously giving Latin Americans a disadvantage on that particular test question.",1187463485

43841,comment,43799,43827,0,0,fadmmatt,,,"I just finished my PhD in CS at Georgia Tech, so I'll share my two cents on the topic.  (My field was programming languages and compilers.)<p>I wouldn't characterize graphics as the ""soundest"" field.  I might give that title to formal methods, where the bar for publication is often a machine-verifiable proof of correctness.  <p>Of course, graphics is math-heavy, too.  A lot of the good graphics folks I know started off as mathematical physicists.<p>For that matter, many sub-disciplines within CS are quite math-heavy.  For my own dissertation, I developed static analyses of programs.  To do so, I modeled the semantics of a programming language as a mathematical relation on machine states.  I then defined new (finitely computable) relations---the analyses---and I proved these are sound simulations of the semantics relation.  Plenty of math involved.<p>Theory folks do plenty of math on the complexity and correctness of algorithms.<p>Machine learning involves lots of probability and statistics.<p>Even the top-notch human-computer interaction people know statistics well.<p>I could go on.  But, I think you could find a way to do some ""real"" math in any field within CS.  (Though I've noticed each sub-discipline has its own self-aggrandizing definition of ""real."")<p>As far as how much of the article resonated with my own experience, I would have to say not much.  I had plenty of cordial debates with professors, but ultimately, we would arrive at either a theorem or a contradiction, and then the debate was ended.  No feelings hurt.  No ego assuaged.  Just a truth uncovered.<p>The one part of the article that does ring true is the myopic vision of the world one receives in academia.  Academia takes center stage as the noblest of all possible pursuits.  The thrill of publication and peer recognition can be intoxicating, especially if you're the kind of person who is obsessed with publicly validating their own intelligence.<p>I'm now taking a year off from academia to work full-time for my two startups, but a part of me feels like I'm selling out by not going on to become a professor right away.  My own advisor warned strenuously me to continue publishing, lest the ""jealous priesthood"" of academia reject my attempt to return.  I know enough, though, to know that he's right.  If I don't continue to publish, academia will cut me off, regardless of how might money I might make doing startups.<p>My parting advice to potential grad students in CS is: (1) choose a field that's growing rather than shrinking, and (2) find an advisor with whom you can develop a comfortable working relationship.  After that, lots of hard work and a modicum of smarts can get you the rest of the way. ",1187461780

I use a blackberry which also has a similar feature - if a number on a web page looks like a phone number you can just click it and it will call the number. However I routinely need to copy paste things from one email to another or from a web page to an email.<p>You may be happy with your iphone, good for you. My point is that you can't call a feature extraneous just because you don't need it and that if you have to reduce features to reduce bugs you have a very serious problem. If your engineers are prone to writing buggy code, the product will be buggy even if it has very few features and vice versa. ",1187460931

43837,comment,43799,43799,0,0,npk,,,"I can't say anything about CS, but in physics, these comments are spot on.  The essay points out: ""A Ph.D in the humanities is useful for one thing only these days, and that's being an academic.""  Ok, a phd in physics gives you more flexibility, but while you're in grad school, your professors expect the best and brightest to go into academia, the less smart go off and work in industry.<p>Again, I don't know if the ""academia uber alles"" attitude pervades CS.  But, suppose it's common.  Imagine how that will make you feel if you want to go work in something so undignified as consumer internet applications.  The academic attitude is really a brainfuck, UNLESS, you want to be an academic :)\n",1187460781

43834,comment,43799,43809,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"This seems like a strange statement to make -- for a lot of people, the careers aren't really substitutes for each other.  If you like the life of pure research, why would you be interested in a startup?  Likewise, if you like the action and risk of entrepreneurship, why on earth would you consider academia?  You can't claim that for everyone, it's better to do a startup than to be an academic.",1187460106

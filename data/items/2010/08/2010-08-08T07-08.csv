The reasoning seems to be that if you keep people from making the 5 or 8 or 10 or whatever most common kinds of errors, you get a huge win for relatively little cost, whereas deploying a system that actually solves the problem fully is much harder. It also integrates more easily with the human decision processes--- a system that just says, ""hey, have you thought of this pitfall?"" is easier to get people to at least accept input from than a system that says, ""AI has determined that the right answer is X"".",1281254320

India is much, much better off today than they would have been had colonialism continued. One of India's biggest and most successful economic transformations was in ending the Zamindars (landlords that were effectively feudal lords), that almost certainly wouldn't have happened under the Raj.

I'd be more impressed with a CS degree from MIT than pretty much anywhere else. 
For starters you were no mug to accepted there in the first place. While there you would have benefited from interaction with a high achieving peer group.
And the teaching would probably be pretty good as well.

1585001,comment,1584995,1584995,0,0,dwwoelfel,,,"The abstract of the paper:<p>The history of patents begins, not with inventions, but with royal grants of industrial monopolies in the fifteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, however, patents represent a legal right to property in a novel mechanical or scientific invention. Commentators today maintain that this radical shift from royal monopoly privilege to legal property right occurred solely in response to economic or institutional demands. While political, economic and institutional conditions certainly played a role in this story, this article maintains that the ideas of John Locke were the fountainhead behind the evolution of patents for inventions.<p>Although there were fits and starts toward a new patent doctrine in the seventeenth century, the watershed moment occurred when the common law courts acquired jurisdiction over patents from the Privy Council in the mid-eighteenth century. The common law judges - learned men steeped in the traditional rights of Englishmen and the philosophy of natural rights - redefined the doctrine of patents by drawing upon the ideas that formed the basis of their own political and legal philosophy. The result was the novelty and the specification requirements, which are first described by Lord Mansfield and Justice Buller in terms that reflect John Locke's labor theory of property and social contract theory. In surveying the historical record, i.e., in looking at the ways in which royal councilors, judges and inventors conceived of patents between 1550 and 1800, the influence of Locke's ideas upon this important legal doctrine is evident. This provenance of patent law thus suggests that an inventor's moral right to the property in one's invention should play a role in the ongoing debate concerning the protections afforded by the patent laws.",1281252160

1584984,comment,1584699,1584699,0,0,zabuni,,,"The main problem with tv is not the fact that a person watches video, although I think the video medium is one that tends to manipulative because it combines a lot of emotional elements. The problem is the linearity of television. You turn it on, something is on the television, and you watch it if you want, or turn to another channel.<p>You hear it in the language, you watch tv, not watch Law and Order, or watch Friends (with some exceptions for really popular shows like Lost) Where Hulu/Netflix/DVR/Dvds come in is that they direct the watching experience. You choose to watch something, making it much less of a block of time everyday.<p>Part of what Shirky's book, Cognitive Surplus, which was mentioned in the article, is that the cost of organizing people has gotten much less since the invention of the Internet. People now do things besides television watching, like Etsy, or discuss politics, or having communities of artists, because doing those things is more rewarding that television, and about as easy to set up as watching television. Note all of the startup advice hear on Hacker News.<p>I agree with the author a little in the end, that the activities won't always be positive. The same abilities that allow us to coordinate disaster relief funding from the home also all pro-anorexia support groups to flourish. I also think the reviewer missed one of the better points in the book, that the difficult part will be getting people to do something more valuable than television. It's great to create, but most people will create lolcatz pictures, which isn't that much better than television.<p>Overall, pretty good book at describing the Internet phenom of online groups being able to do a whole lot given the right circumstances. I imagine if Paul Graham was ever in any type of trouble, the denizens of Hacker News would probably turn out in a similar fashion to some of the examples given in the book.",1281250910

I want to title my talk - Why You Should Be a Hacker. The rough outline is: <p>1) Cheapest way to innovate - low barrier to entry, you can build things without having a lab, lots of tools, or anything more than a computer, and building things is FUN!<p>2) You live in the center of the startup world. SV is a special place, and you are lucky to be a part of it already.<p>3) Software will be everywhere (rotary phone evolves into the iPhone) - even if you don't hack professionally, you'll want to know how things actually work. <p>4) You can wear whatever you want (this is more about hackers being rule-breakers)<p>5) It's all about practice - and you have a big headstart.<p>PG's essays are awesome for someone who already knows they are a hacker to get inspired to do something on their own. I'm hoping to inspire the next generation of YC'ers to start now.<p>Any suggestions? \n",1184610396

34518,comment,34401,34401,0,0,hello_moto,,,"Come to think, this ""scenario"" seems like a good idea rather than going through YCombinator.<p>Think about it. Find something easy to implement (shouldn't be more than 1.5 months effort) and target it to TechCrunch audience. Flip the site for $25k - $30k and embark to your ultimate goal.<p>Now you don't have to share 6% - 10% of your company to YCombinator (or other similar companies)",1184609846

So where is the problem?<p>> ""People come, they consume and they leave. Sad, but that's life. But still the site is built to favor not their experience, but the experience of those who is deeply involved with Wikipedia""<p>You say that is if it's a bad thing. It's not as if there was any content there if the site wasn't accomodating to those who actually help out.<p>> ""the change initiated by those outside of the community.""<p>Making a websites with some screen mockups, zero code and a huge font as to make the whole thing unreadable isn't initiating change, it's piggybacking on the success and popularity of Wikipedia.<p>I mean, yes, by all means get involved and help improve it. But just telling them from the outside what to do, that's silly. Actually, all the content is free. You can make a mirror of Wikipedia and implement those changes. Let us see a live demo, you know.

App quality is often higher however.<p>It's not really comparable to Linux packages. GPL software is nice, but it's usually also a lot of work until it works the way you want - paid apps are there to do that for you. You could still install most Linux tools using Macports / Homebrew. At some point you will recognize that sometimes spending 20-30$ instead of investing hours of your time is worth it.<p>Now concerning Apple's own software: IF they fit your needs they are usually a total no-brainer. Pages/Numbers/Keynote give you 90% of the power of MS Office, in a more consistent  way and at 1/4 of the price. Similar things can be said about Aperture and Final Cut X, Logic Pro even being the industry leader from what I hear. Apple certainly doesn't make a profit on those alone.",1344387210

4353232,comment,4353087,4353087,7,0,robbiep,,,"I feel like this article misses a number of points.\nFirstly, the modern IPO is chiefly about giving early investors and staff an exit ticket. It is therefore in their interests to price it as high as possible. The fact that there was significant hype around the business meant that they were able to achieve this valuation. The fact that this is distinct from the original aim of the sharemarket - that is, capitalising firms to create new ventures (Think infrastructure - the golden age of rail, factories, etc) is an interesting side-note.<p>Secondly, the marketplace often operates on the stupidity of the masses. Intelligent fund managers stay away from overpriced IPOs, the uninformed masses pile in because they hear the hype and are not value investors so don't know/care that the revenues aren't behind the company.<p>3- A successful IPO is one that is fully capitalised and gives the company new cash.\nIt is not one that goes through the roof. This would represent a failure of the Merchant Bank to properly capitalise on the company's value (They could have charged a higher value for the IPO as that would have better represented the fair value of the company)\n - in fact, in a perfectly valued company it should track mostly flat as the investor return is priced into the dividend + some accumulation of value.<p>The Facebook float, and the Zynga float, and numerous others, thus represents a good example of management and investment banks fully capitalising on the hype surrounding them to extract maximum returns for the early investors.\nThe fact that this screws later investors is secondary.",1344386448

The other cars will then give the human extra room (e.g., no drafting or close formation driving on the freeway, no crossing at right angles in an intersection at full speed just inches apart, or that kind of stuff that the cars will do when computers are driving all of the cars in an area).<p>The automated system will still be monitoring the human and can take over if the human does something bad, so the other drivers don't have to worry that a human driven car will suddenly cross the line into their lane and kill them.<p>This could even be turned into a game, where the automated system can score the human driver based on how well the human drove and how often the system had to intervene to keep the human from crashing.<p>Note that racing could also be allowed in such a system.

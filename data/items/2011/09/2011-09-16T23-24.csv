I was at Yahoo before Bartz, and left only about a month before she was fired. I don't believe that Bartz destroyed anything. Yahoo has never had a great culture. They've always had an identity crisis. You can go read PG's older essays and see that.<p>Bartz was fired because she couldn't work a miracle. Yahoo needs some truly amazing changes in order to avoid Sun's fate, and I'm not sure anyone out there can/will deliver what's needed quickly enough. You mentioned Apple as a turnaround example. Exactly where do you think Yahoo is going to get a Steve Jobs?",1316217493

If we fail, we fail.  A startup failure won't affect how my family sees me, how my friends see me, or how my girlfriend sees me.  And I'm never again going to let the possibility of failure affect how I see myself.</i><p>I feel like this is a lot easier to say after having a success, especially if that success put some money in the bank. Having a healthy fear of business failure is a good thing, as it allows you to see the potential negative outcomes. It's the fear of failure in life that negatively affects decision-making, and it seems unreasonable to expect someone with no history of success and no comfortable safety net to avoid succumbing to that.",1316217443

If they could find an elegant solution that leveraged their legacy software library into a useful touch-based experience, they'd have a great shot at succeeding.  It appears they took too long to move (iOS and Android both have large software libraries already), and aren't able to leverage their legacy software in a meaningful way.  They've just strapped ""legacy"" support on top of Metro, and are only providing it for some hardware.

This particular advice gets its sensationalism and counterintuitiveness by claiming that it's a universal rule. As a universal rule, it has its downsides.<p>One downside is that, if everyone does this, we make it far harder for law enforcement to do worthwhile investigations. Programmers hate when roadblocks prevent us from iterating quickly during development. Understand, other occupations also suffer from the same crunch on their time that we do and, as a community that's all in this together, we benefit from their work.<p>Another downside is promoting an adversarial role between law enforcement and its citizenry. This is an intangible, but I think its costs are real.<p>Also, you'd better be very confident that the cop(s) will simply respect your rights under the law. I know of situations where that has not been the case. I've seen videos where it wasn't the case. We've all read stories where it wasn't the case.<p>It's easy to fantasize stories about you being wrongfully singled out or, heaven forbid, convicted. We've also all read stories about that. Just like everything in life, then, it's a cost/benefits analysis. But don't pretend that one choice is all benefits and no costs.<p>I think the speed of modern news dissemination is warping our risk assessment software. Things that you'd only hear of rarely are reported several times a day now, because there's 6 billion people having bad things happen to them, the news only cares about those bad things, and our attention for those bad things is the same size as ever. The bad things per attention minute is rising all the time. Partly because of this, and partly because we are the way we are, there's a penchant by some in my geeky, libertarian community to withdraw as citizens, and overestimate downside risk. Yes, you expose yourself to risk by rescuing that drowning man; yes, you expose yourself to risk by finding that lost girl's mom; yes, you expose yourself to risk by cooperating with authorities. And, you know what, I think it should be worth it to you.<p>As a side note, attorneys are very familiar with the system and feel confident about fighting it head on, and many attorneys are willing to lead a high stress, confrontational life style. One should bear that in mind when taking advice about how to lead one's life.",1316216432

3006734,comment,3003470,3003763,4,0,mas644,,,"I've seen this point brought up. Making some easy (which I'm all for btw) does not mean it has to lock down aspects that average users are not meant to look at it (i.e. DRM). It's fine if they hide them, but when there are software and hardware mechanisms that prevent power users from manipulating the device - that is unnecessary. I should be able to replace the OS as well as install any app that I please on the device. They are actually taking EXTRA steps to prevent me from seeing the internals by using things like hardware level OS image hashes (i.e. tivoization).<p>Now people say, I just want to use my device and get work/play done. THat's fine, I'm all for it. However, having control benefits everybody. For example, if you want to tether your smartphone and use it as a wireless access point, writing the software to do this is trivial (and a power user can do it for you). However, smartphone companies don't want you doing that...unless you pay them more money for that feature. That's kind of unfair, the smartphone company is depending on PROPRIETARY LOCKIN rather than real competition. That's my problem with it. They want to control your experience and make you think you can't get a PREMIUM EXPERIENCE without paying them ludicrous amounts. I mean, all tethering does is update a few IP tables here and there -- I have to pay 10 bucks a month for that??<p>Yeah sure APple did a lot of great things as did Microsoft and Google for bringing computing to the masses. However, they all did it based on the open innovation of others (kernels, compilers, text editors, web servers, etc). They've used those wonderful open things to create a wonderful easy to use experience. At the same time, they've added ARTIFICIAL CONSTRAINTS to it (e.g. again tethering) to create PROPRIETARY LOCKIN and make you think your device has less capability than it really has. If these companies stay on these same paths and people maintain the same level of compliance...we'll get to a point where ALL computers are useless and innovation can't happen. Again, easiness and openness are not orthogonal.",1316216037

Microsoft, like any other incumbent, they prefer to continue to work <i>on top</i> of the old technology. And that pretty much always turns out to be the wrong strategy when disruption happens. It's like Nokia deciding to improve on Symbian instead of going full force on Maemo or Meego later on.<p>The Windows7/desktop mode is creating problems and confusion for the Metro mode, and the Metro mode is frustrating those who want to use the desktop mode. This is why it's never good to combine the 2 worlds: the dying one, and the new one.<p>This is something Steve Jobs also saw, and it's why he kept Mac OS X and iOS separated: one OS for the old world, and one OS for the new world. As the old one fades into the background, the new one gets more and more popularity. That's how you make disruption happen, and how you can embrace it. But Microsoft seems to repeat every mistake in the book. I'm not saying they're not on the right track with Metro, I'm just saying they're choosing the wrong strategy for it, and it will probably ultimately fail.<p>I found Windows 7's learning curve bad enough coming from XP (never used Vista). I used to know where everything was in XP, and I still don't know where a lot of stuff is in Win7, and I've been using it since beta. Imagine how bad the learning curve will be for a ""normal"" user when they get all that plus the Metro stuff being forced on them, when all they expect is ""Windows"". Microsoft is in a very vulnerable position with this paradigm transition. It would've helped if they kept them separated.",1316215899

Nasty in its own right, but then you also put in code so if you recompile the compiler, it adds the code to do this (add the backdoor and add itself to the c compiler) back in.  Then you take the code out of the source file and recompile.<p>Apparently it almost made it out into production Unix, accidentally.  The only thing that stopped it was they had an error in their code that added an extra space each compile cycle and one of the QA guys caught it.",1177067822

I feel its more about knowing the market rate for your employees and making sure they are compensated for what they contribute.  Equity is only one piece.<p>In your example, it sounds like a pretty weak deal.  However, thats not to say that the lesson to learn is to attract employees through equity.<p>Owning equity is about risk.  Employment is about security.  If your really a savvy investor and think that equity in a given company is the best return on your investment, you should offer to put as much cash and man-hours into the company as you can for the greatest return.  Then you are on par with the founders.<p>For interesting reading, look at Warren Buffett's philosophy on employee and management stock options.  In earlier days he attracted key management with a fair salary, a good work environment, and an absolute lock out of equity.. he figured he was the only one taking the risk.",1177066894

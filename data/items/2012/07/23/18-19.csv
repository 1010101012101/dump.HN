Unless you're also posting your address in the video description, it's practically impossible for a viewer to match a name (even your legal name) to your physical location.<p>Clearly you have not spent enough time on 4chan. Two instances off the top of my head:<p>1. Youtuber posts video of his room where he is being mean to his cat. Within 24 hours police are knocking on his door and making an arrest on account of cruelty to animals. 4chan got all his info from something as bening as a webcam's view of a teenager's room.<p>2. Girl throws puppies into river in bosnia. 48 hours later, police is knocking on her door on account of animal cruelty charges. 4chan had nothing to go on but a video of some average-looking wilderness.<p>Also a famous case of a few lads throwing a puppy off a bridge.<p>Now imagine how quickly all of those stories woudl unfold with a <i>name</i> attached! Unimaginably quickly.<p>Remember, 4chan is the kind of ""guy"" who tracked down Boxxy and harassed her so much she practically hid from the internet for ~4 years. All from videos of nothing but a face with a black background. They found her home address, her phone number, the school she goes to. Everything.<p>4chan is scary.

He had a sniffle. The physical exam screamed viral. The rapid strep test was negative. I advised my standard care for viral upper respiratory infections. He was fine with that but looked at me like a whipped puppy while his mom berated me for not prescribing an antibiotic.<p>Later, a 35 yo woman with chronic supperative otitis media comes in, she's had chunks of her skull removed and can't hear out of her right ear because her eardrum doesn't exist any more, comes in with her dad because she can't drive due to chronic vestibular dysfunction (she's been dizzy since she was 5). She is a portrait of misery, holding back tears during the exam, profusely apologetic for coming in, this is her first infection in 2 years and she's just in absolute despair because she doesn't want more surgery, and begs for the antibiotic only because the antibiotic-steroid combo, in her experience, hurts more and promises she will got to the ER if she gets a headache.

4282462,comment,4281480,4281832,12,0,tallanvor,,,"First, Breivik's acts in Norway were terrorism.  Don't pretend that because he's Norwegian he wasn't trying to use fear and violence to cause political change.<p>Second, I'm sorry, but as an American who currently lives in Oslo (and was at work 2 blocks from where the bomb exploded last year), the comparison to how America has reacted to terrorism compared to how Norway reacted to this event is entirely fair.<p>Immediately after the bombing, nobody knew who was responsible, but many people immediately started theorizing that it must have been Muslim extremists (Norway is active in the international community, and not everyone is happy with them based on their attempts to help with negotiations between Israel/Palestine, opposing forces in Sri Lanka, and not to mention their ongoing attempts to figure out what to do with Mullah Krekar).<p>After the attacks, the government could very easily have made changes to the law and done so very quickly (look at how the U.S. was able to pass the horrible Patriot Act in less than a month after 9/11).  Instead they had a very reasoned response.  --The army was deployed to several locations around Oslo for two days (to help keep people out of areas with heavy damage after the bomb, around their parliament, palace, and a few other locations), and then they were gone.  Very few new laws have been introduced - the only big one is the one to allow them to hold Breivik in prison even if he is declared insane, although they're now considering laws to allow more internet monitoring, which I hope will not pass.<p>In comparison, the U.S. reaction to 9/11 (which resulted in fewer deaths and injuries per capita than in Norway) include the Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security, and military tribunals where defendants and their legal counsel aren't even allowed to see the evidence against them.<p>I had a lot of friends and relatives asking me if I wanted to move back to the States after the attack, and I've always been able to point to the reasonable response Norway had to a horrific attack vs how the U.S. responded and easily say no.",1343069662

4282449,comment,4281244,4281244,-1,0,Jd,,,"From an evolutionary psychological standpoint I find this ridiculous:<p>Traditional standpoint is that men go to places where women are (e.g. bars) and hit on them. This requires a combination of various skills on the part of men, including resource acquisition (to be able to buy drinks for women), social skills, and the ability to be aggressive in a non-threatening way (e.g. to approach an attractive woman and chat her up).<p>There are of course many variations on this, but the skills that men ostensibly need to succeed in them are, generally speaking, some rough combination of the above -- which, perhaps unsurprisingly -- are some combination of the same skills that many women would want for a male partner (i.e. assertive, successful, socially capable, attractive).<p>The presence of these so-called ""feminist"" threads on HN often take the form of hackers, who presumably do not have all of the aforementioned skills, attempting to get women to come to them. I think it is reasonably obvious that the motivations include the fact that people who do not have all of the aforementioned capabilities and who are limited to incredible hacking skills, want to be able to succeed with women (e.g. obtain sex and/or relationship) on their own terms.<p>Personally, I believe this is both selfish and a violation of evolutionary norms. Certainly, there is a place for certain types of affirmative action, but in this case (and many like it) it is pretty clear that the action is not made so that the end product is better (i.e. better computer programs built in less time), but that nerds get babes.<p>While there may be some success with respect to the <i>unstated</i> motivation, I think the fundamental dishonesty with respect to the approach vector means that you will never  attract the type of woman that you would ideally want to couple with (yes, I'm speaking primarily to a male audience here).<p>There may be ""good enough"" couplings insofar as there clearly is some appeal here from the standpoint of women, given the relatively high salary of nerds (I saw some unusual couplings \nin silicon valley along these lines, particularly in the South Bay), but I don't think this is a very good strategy long term.<p>At the very least, I think the motivations need to be clear. Why do dudes in industries that are dominated by dudes want to have women around them in the work place so bad? Yes, we know why, and so do most women. There are other reasons of course, but we have to be honest about all of them when we are coming up with a supposed ""solution.""",1343069494

4282354,comment,4281842,4281842,43,0,imgabe,,,"One of the things that struck me while reading Jobs' biography was how frequently he cried. Numerous times throughout he's described as weeping, sometimes at momentous occasions, like getting fired from Apple, and sometimes over relatively trivial matters. Think about it. When was the last time you saw a grown person cry about something at work? Ever?<p>I think one of the things that made Steve Steve, and made him capable of doing the things he did, was how deeply he felt things. When a design wasn't right it actually seemed to cause him great emotional pain. People in emotional pain tend to lash out angrily. Just like you might forgive your spouse for saying something awful in the heat of an argument (I honestly believe it affected him on that deep of an emotional level), I think people forgave Steve because they knew that even when he was being vicious, it wasn't because he literally hated them. He was just deeply, personally wounded that his expectations weren't being met.<p>Now, it's not normal for anyone to care that deeply about what most people consider minor details, like the angle a corner is beveled at or something like that, but he did. And that level of caring about the details is what made Apple's products great.<p>Think about the last time anyone has done any work for you. Was there anything that was off? Probably there was. Most people weigh the benefit of fixing whatever minor problem there might be against the hassle of explaining what's wrong and waiting for it to be redone and the possibility of insulting the person who did the work and decide it's not worth it. You probably do this without even thinking about it. Obviously, for Steve it was always worth it, and that probably had a lot do with how emotionally sensitive he was.<p>It's easy to look back and say that you could have achieved the same results while being a nicer person, but I think it's easier said than done. I'm not saying it's impossible in general, but I think the deeply emotional place that Steve's sense of design came from made it nearly impossible for him. The important thing to take away was how much he was able to achieve because he cared so deeply, not the tyrannical aspect. That was a side effect. If you seek to emulate his tyranny (because you like being a tyrant, maybe) assuming that you'll get the same results, you're bound to be disappointed.",1343068330

I'm in the earliest stages of starting a company that will apply ""modern technology"" to common medical devices.<p>The first product we're working is a variation on the Epipen. Essentially, we'd be adding GPS / 911 / emergency contact capability directly into the Epipen.  Minutes matter when people are going into anaphylactic shock, so the goal of this product would be to reduce the amount of time that it takes for emergency services (paramedics, first responders, emergency room doctors, etc.) to respond to a life-threatening allergic reaction.<p>Here's how it would work. Once the Epipen is used (injected) by the user, the following would happen:<p>1) A GPS device on the Epipen is activated.<p>2) 911 is automatically notified of the user's location, and allergy history / profile.<p>3) Paramedics / EMTs would be able to track any changes to the user's location (using the GPS), as well as be able to prep the proper medication for the user's condition.<p>4) The user's parents / emergency contacts would receive a text message / automated call, letting them know that the Epipen has been activated. In addition, they would be able to track the users location using a mobile application on their iPhone / Android phone.<p>Now, for a few questions:<p>1) Do you think that this type of function would be useful / necessary for someone who needs to carry an Epipen? Or is this just an extraneous feature?<p>2) Would this give you peace of mind, knowing that you (or your family member) has this backup on the Epipen?<p>3) Would you pay anything extra for this service?

4282300,comment,4279747,4280466,1,0,learc83,,,"I agree that some <i>rulers</i> of ancient Rome attacked christianity in part because they feared it threatened their political power (not the case for Diocletian as I'll explain later). But if you'll look throughout the history of religious persecution in western monotheistic societies, you'll notice that most of state sponsored persecution was motivated by the same thing--not some newly minted religious zeal sparked by monotheism, but good old fashioned political considerations.<p>However Roman society in general <i>did</i> persecute the Christians because of their differing religious beliefs. There are <i>numerous</i> accounts of pagan mobs composed of ordinary citizens attacking early Christians. The everyday pagans didn't form mobs because they were worried about the instability of the political regime, but because Christianity challenged their core beliefs--the very definition of religious intolerance. In addition much of the persecution by the Roman state was carried out because it was demanded by the people, not the rulers--motivated by religious intolerance.<p>>It absorbed many other cults<p>You'll also note that the Dionysian mystery cult was banned by the state for almost 200 years before they absorbed it, and other cults were banned before it.<p>> For the Romans, religion wasn't necessarily a fanatical pursuit<p>That is completely untrue, sure there were Romans who were only half hearted about religion just as there are less enthusiastic practitioners in a monotheistic religion. But if you think religion wasn't a fanatical pursuit for the Romans you need to read more on the initiation rituals of the mystery cults.<p>Additionally the particular sadism with which Christians were met speaks directly to the fanaticism of their persecutors. Diocletian (who institutionalize Christian persecution) developed a hatred for christians because pagan fortune tellers told him they could no longer divine the outcome of battles due to Christian influence, and he began his full-scale persecution when priests of the Oracle of Apollo told him they too could no longer divine the future because of the influence of Christians.<p>The most <i>severe</i> Christian persecution of the Roman Empire was directly caused by <i>religious fanaticism</i>.<p>> monotheistic religions are inherently more intolerant because of their rejection of anything other than their singular god.<p>Polytheism didn't make the Romans inherently more tolerant. They added gods to their pantheon, but only after those gods were thoroughly Romanized. In short they were only tolerant of religion that was very similar to what already existed allowing for slight variation along the way.<p>How is adding a new god, who has been modified to fit your pantheon, any more tolerant than early Christians who adopted certain customs and dates from pagan celebrations?<p>Person A believes in a single all encompassing God and will not allow to worship any other. However he will make some concessions by adding a new feast day on the day you traditional celebrate your god and will incorporate some elements of your festival into it.<p>Person B believes in 20 gods with different spheres of influence. He will let you worship any other god so long as you change it so that it is nearly indistinguishable from his existing pantheon, and thus no longer really the god you worship.<p>How is person B inherently more tolerant?",1343067653

4282289,comment,4278250,4278912,1,0,yourapostasy,,,"You, briandear, and refurb are painting with broad strokes where a more nuanced view might provide more insight. See the Reynolds, Kolodziej paper [1]. It was a complex situation with many factors.<p>I was curious about your claim, so I did some cursory digging to compare defense spend against potential oil export revenue. ""Potential"" because I can't find evidence the USSR exported before 1990.<p>According to some inflation-adjusted data I found [2], from 1980-1990 (approximately the period everyone is likely discussing here), in real terms the $/bbl dropped from $104.49 to $40.67. At this point the analysis of your claim becomes rather challenging. According to the US EIA [3], the USSR had no import/export figures to report prior to 1992. What we have left is to posit their total imputed revenue loss upon all production, and guess at their losses from various barter-like trades they performed for the oil. I'd appreciate it if anyone had more accurate data (unfortunately, Wolfram Alpha doesn't have this kind of data).<p>Assume for the sake of discussion you were right, and the Saudis pushed down the price of oil from 1980-1990. How much did this cost the USSR in lost oil production revenue? I pulled total production numbers from an US EIA spreadsheet [4]. By my calculations (I'll post the spreadsheet to a Google Docs if anyone is really interested in pursuing this), it is $2.2375E+12 USD in real terms, or $2.2T in round numbers. Even if the USSR consumed 50% and exported the rest in swap trades, that is still $1.1T over 10 years.<p>Taking refurb's numbers on defense spend and assuming an equal distribution across 10 years of $13.2B extra per year, or $132B over 10 years for the US. Even if we assume the USSR kept pace with that spending, or even doubled, you are right, the potential export losses on USSR oil dwarf the defense spending. If I were Russian, I'd want a Putin at the head of the table in a geopolitical climate that engineers that kind of machination, too. If this was engineered as some claim, it is one of the greatest untold stories of market manipulation and geopolitical chutzpah of astonishing scale.<p>Here is where it gets interesting and I can't connect the dots to tie up your theory. If you look at the US EIA figures [5], Saudi Arabian production <i>dropped</i> from 1980-1985. That is not consistent with the theory that Saudi Arabia pushed down prices during that period, as one would expect them to flood the market to accomplish a price decline.<p>I'm intrigued to hear other explanations of what caused that precipitous price decline in the 1980-1990 period that would be consistent with the available data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.bu.edu/marek/FSU_Oil_Decline.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.bu.edu/marek/FSU_Oil_Decline.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://inflationdata.com/inflation/inflation_rate/historical_oil_prices_table.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inflationdata.com/inflation/inflation_rate/historical...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=RS&trk=p1#pet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=RS&tr...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/ipm/supply.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/ipm/supply.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=SA#pet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=SA#pet</a>",1343067506

Instead, and completely unexpectedly, I get a scary modal dialog ""Start using your full name on YouTube"". Really, that's bad enough as it is. I didn't interact in a way that'd make me expect any kind of dialog (e.g. logging in/out or a major account modification). And there is no easy way to dismiss the dialog without making a decision, no X in a corner, clicking the background does nothing. Also really, really bad. Opening another YouTube window doesn't help, either, you just get another copy of the dialog.<p>But the reaction to declining the request -- which is the non-default, non-highlighted option -- is just outrageous. Instead of simply going away silently, or maybe telling me where to activate the feature if I change my mind, it tells me <i>it'll show my real name anyway</i>, but just in a preview mode that's only visible to me, if I just click the default, highlighted button. That's not exactly the opposite of what I wanted it to do when I declined their unprovoked offer, but it's pretty damn close. And again, there is no easy way out, you have to chose a reason why you dare refuse them, with none of the options being ""I decline to answer"" or ""Go to hell""; the closest thing being ""I'm not sure, I'll decide later"", which I chose and which I expect will just mean I'll be assaulted again in the near future.<p>This is the kind of hostile user experience I expect on cheap travel websites and other scummy parts of the net, but not on a Google property and certainly not on a website I visit a lot.",1343067279

4282232,comment,4279364,4280941,2,0,vidarh,,,"I can understand that people are worried. But for anyone who reads this who fall in the worried category, I usually ask for at least 20%-30% more. Asking for just a tiny increase has never been something I'd even consider. There are situations I might <i>settle</i> for an increase in that range if the original offer was high enough, but I'd certainly ask for more than that. If asking for an increase that low is rocking the boat, there will be other problems with that employer...<p>A counter-intuitive trick for those who have trouble getting offers and/or worry about talking up their offers: Look for jobs below your desired salary range.<p>Most people look for jobs where any stated salary range match what they expect based on past experience - I see that in candidates for jobs I hire for all the times. Most candidates fit squarely within the range.<p>If you look for jobs slightly lower, it will often mean you interview against less skilled candidates than yourself. As long as you can convince the hiring manager you're not overqualified and looking to leave as soon as possible, it significantly increases your chances of an offer.<p>Once you have an offer, if you stand out skills wise, you'll be in a far stronger position to ask for more, even if you're asking for more than their salary range - everyone will have ""invested"" in you as their preferred choice, and standing out in terms of skills makes it easier to justify to HR to offer even beyond the top end of the range, sometimes beyond what they'd planned on stretching to.<p>I've seen this work from both sides of the table - psychologically it's hard to give up what is seen as a great deal, even when the other side makes the deal less and less attractive (by bumping up the salary requirements), and in the end people (on both ends) tend to be happier with deals where they've had to negotiate.",1343066822

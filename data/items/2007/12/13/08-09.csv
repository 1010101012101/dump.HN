89068,comment,88924,88924,0,0,brianr,,,"In high school I wrote a simple web-based voting app for school elections (an election I was running in, no less)... had I wanted to rig the election, it would have been trivial to do so and cover my tracks. As downer articulated, there's absolutely no reason to believe that electronic voting results aren't being manipulated.<p>Seems like voting might be one of the few areas where more technology is <i>not</i> a good thing.",1197534832

Lots of people have done those, right?  Mozy, Carbonite, iDrive... google can easily find dozens of them.<p>But that's just the ""30 thousand feet"" view of what I'm doing.  I'm not just doing online backups -- I'm doing <i>secure</i> online backups.  Secure in the sense that I can't steal your data.  Secure in the sense that the NSA can't steal your data.<p>Have other companies done online backup?  Absolutely.  Can anyone else reasonably describe what they're doing as ""backups for the truly paranoid""?  No -- that's something which nobody else has done.",1197534513

89060,comment,88946,88946,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"For really simple sites that don't need a full blown database backed CMS I just use simple PHP includes like the following:<p><pre><code>    <?php\n        $title = ""Whatever"";\n        include(""header.php"");\n        include(""content.txt""); // or just include the content inline\n        include(""footer.php"");\n    ?>\n</code></pre>\nThen header.php is just:<p><pre><code>    <html>\n    <head>\n        <title>My Site - <?php echo $title; ?></title>\n        <!-- other header stuff like css, scripts, etc -->\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=""content"">\n</code></pre>\nand footer.php is just:<p><pre><code>        </div>\n        <!-- other footer stuff like Google Analytics, etc -->\n     </body>\n     </html>\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to get a little fancier you can set up a URL rewriting (like Apache's mod_rewrite) to internally change yoursite.com/section/subsection to yoursite.com/content.php?a=section&b=subection or something, then you can eliminate all the duplicate templates and just have your content files (<i>make sure you validate the section and subsection names</i>). Or you could plug in a really simple database.<p>I'm no PHP expert, so if anyone has better ways of doing this kind of thing I'd love to hear it.<p>(actually, I have a question: with this layout it's hard to pass data from included files back up to the templates, like $title above needs to be defined before the header include... is there some trick I'm missing?)",1197533937

89055,story,,,44,58,rontr,"Ask YC: Will there really always be room for more successful web startups?",,"I've heard the argument (also made by PG) that there will always be room for more successful web startups. Do you think it's true?<p>Sometimes I get the feeling that the internet has gotten too crowded. Every idea I think of, someone else has done.<p>But it's more than that. I also sometimes think that mainstream users have a finite number of needs that web applications can satisfy. I think of web applications are like kitchen appliances. Once you have the essentials -- a microwave, a fridge, an oven, a toaster, a coffee maker, and a blender -- new appliances you get have decreasing marginal utility. Sure, you can always get new ones for increasingly esoteric needs, but they are just not as useful as the important ones that almost everyone has.<p>I read about all the new startups on TechCrunch and YC news, and although I think many of them are cool, I don't use 99% of them. Why? Because although they may solve some problem I may or may not have, incorporating them into my life introduces mental overhead. It's like PG's essay about stuff. Having less stuff keeps your head clear. So does using fewer webapps. I'd rather use 5-10 really useful apps than 40-50 marginally useful ones. Although the total utility I can get from the marginally useful apps is greater than zero, this utility doesn't outweigh the disadvantage of having to think about them. They solve some problem, but they also add (virtual) clutter to my life. As a user (which is different from an entrepreneur in the same field) I'd rather not think about them.<p>Will there really be the next big search engine or the next big social networking site? (By big I mean bigger than the entrenched players.) I'm not convinced. Some industries mature and their barriers to entry become too high. (How many new car companies have been started in the last couple of decades? Not many.) Furthermore, after every adoption of a new product, users have a smaller reason to switch. I don't care if ask.com is sometimes better than Google or if some social networking site is slighly less creepy than Facebook. I still use Facebook and Google. They are wired too deep in my cortex. Trying out a competing product just isn't worth the work.<p>I'm sure there will always be <i>technology</i> startups. And there will always be new marginally successful webapps that cater to small niches (I just thought of one: a hot-or-not for pets app that runs on the iPhone! Maybe that's my ticket to riches!) But will there always be the next world-changing <i>web</i> startup?<p>What do you think?",1197533336
89054,comment,88914,88914,0,0,jamiequint,,,"The idea of companies getting free labor isn't neccessarily true, at least not for more meaningful jobs where the lead in time from hiring to productivity is longer (hence the desire for low turnover). <p>However, I believe what this article is suggesting that if the system were to change so internships as ""free trial[s]"" were the norm companies would likely have better hires in the long term. <p>Since markets with more liquidity adjust more rapidly, allowing people to move around more and allowing companies to better hire for culture fit (which may be hard to determine in a series of interviews) would ultimately result in a happier (and more efficient) labor market. Interesting idea.",1197533299

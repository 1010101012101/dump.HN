9001824,comment,9001509,9001725,0,0,droopybuns,,,"If you develop a successful business plan selling pineapples- and then a regulator comes in and says that assumptions x, y, & z are no longer legal- why would a business owner decide not to &quot;waste money&quot; on courts?  Is it not obvious that the best reason to do so is that you&#x27;ve made investments based on a set of assumptions that have a longer horizon than the next 6 months?<p>The courts exist to provide relief in the case of a conflict.  Without them, the only conflict solution is violence.  If a company has invested billions in network upgrades and has a regulator come in and upset the apple cart- it&#x27;s either cheaper to accept it or it&#x27;s disastrous.  I know the appeal of hyperbole, but apply occam&#x27;s razor.  Why would they &#x27;waste money&#x27; on the courts?<p>Swapping copper for fiber requires expensive trench digging.  Planning upgrades costs billions.<p>Monopoly is a word which you are misusing.  Verizon is the leading wireless ISP in the country.  Comcast is the leading wireline ISP in the country.

Context. There are few population-based studies reporting longitudinal changes in total tes-
tosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and limited information on risk factors for their change.
Objective. The objective of the study was to examined 5-year changes in serum T, LH, FSH, and
SHBG levels among Australian men.
Design. A randomly selected, community based cohort of 1,588 men age 35 or older at recruit-
ment (mean age 54؎11y), with available data at two visits. Men on medications known to affect,
or with established pathology of, the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis were excluded, leav-
ing 1,382 for analysis.
Results. Mean baseline and follow-up T levels were 16.2؎1.4nmol/L and 15.6؎1.4nmol/L; a
change of -0.13nmol/L/y. Annualized T changes were associated with being unmarried, obesity,
and smoking at baseline, but not diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. T declined
in men with persistent depression, or who developed chronic disease, and increased in men who
were married, as compared to unmarried, at both time points. In the multivariate analysis,
smoking cessation, development of central (waist >100cm) or generalised (BMI > 30) obesity
resulted in T decreases of 0.36, 0.25, and 0.20nmol/L/y respectively. Quitting smoking, developing
obesity, and having persisting depression were inversely related to SHBG change.
Conclusions. An age-related decline in T levels is not inevitable but largely explained by smoking
behaviour and intercurrent changes in health status, particularly obesity and depression.&quot;",1423109836

The reason is that floating point instructions are executed on a separate unit (the FPU), with a separate decoder. This unit would not have the means to communicate back information such as &quot;change privilege level&quot; (normally it can only signal floating point exceptions, and other than that its only output is on the floating point registers). It would make more sense to encode the backdoor on an illegal opcode, i.e. an opcode that under normal conditions would generate a UD# exception, but with the correct values in the registers it would trigger some undocumented behavior.<p>Another question is how to hide this backdoor in the microcode. Presumably, at some point someone might stumble upon the backdoor and ask around about it. If the backdoor depends on some &quot;magic values&quot;, it would be relatively easy to spot just by looking at the microcode.<p>There&#x27;s also the point that the author mentioned of &quot;fixing&quot; the processor at some point during the production process. I don&#x27;t think that the author understands the way mass production of microchips works. It&#x27;s very much not possible to do something like this while keeping the production price on the same level (or someone noticing this extra step in the production process).<p>All in all, it sounds much easier to find security bugs in other parts of the system.",1423109515

It&#x27;s sort of silly because it is all the same strains, grown by the same people who are growing it for the black market 10 years ago, or still may be. There are some legitimate true medical strains, like the ones high in CBD or CBN. As far as your standard cannabis though, the goals of people growing your average medical cannabis are exactly the same as the recreational… Make it as potent (high THC by weight) and flavorful as possible. At this point stores use the quality and price difference to try to encourage you to sign up through their clinic service, which they make money from. Medical in CO is about like a club you buy into.<p>Here in Colorado, the best thing to do is to still just go to my friends house, where I can get an ounce as good or better as the highest quality medical available, for 50 or $100 less with no government involved - just like 10 years ago but cheaper and higher quality.",1423108968

For rent they will pay you a dram whisky annually, but you have to go collect it in person. They are located on the Isle of Isley off the coast of Scotland, so unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to collect my rent yet. Hopefully someday.",1423108966

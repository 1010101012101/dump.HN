She doesn't know what an isosceles triangle is though.<p>My father was educated well but he had lost his job and didn't have work for years. We didn't have enough food to eat. But what my parents had, was a desire for me to be educated. Not by forcing me to necessarily get good grades but by encouraging my hobbies.<p>EDIT: removed an unclear sentence<p>> Are you sure you (and those who upvoted) know what social class is? ... having a university degree would be put your father as middle class in most of them.<p>What about a homeless person on the streets who has a PhD? What class are they in? I would say they are in the ""poor"" class. What about not being able to  buy food or clothes? What class is that? I would say in the Western society nowadays that would qualify as ""poor"".

The battery is just never charged _when I want it_.<p>The difference - I use my kindle for solid, long stretch reading, and may set the kindle down for a few weeks or more,  and that stupid wireless always gets turned on sometimes in that interval.  (It's better on the K2, but the K1 was horrible)  - And I've used the wireless function a grand total of 15 minutes in the two plus years of ownership and 200+ hours of reading.  Worst design flaw I've ever seen in a product, where a feature that should be off almost 100% of the time is frequently turned on, wiping out one of the key differentiators of the product - long battery life.<p>Now that I think of it, I didn't have really that great an experience on battery life on my K1, even without the wireless, and would typically go on a trip with multiple battery packs, and a solar charger.

There are a lot of fundamentalists out there, and 99% of the time they scare the shit out of me because of what their unchecked advocacy could ultimately lead to.  Stallman's fundamentalism on the other hand, does not seem likely to ever lead to any detrimental effect on society.<p>In other words, it's not just about respecting Stallman's conviction, but also acknowledging that his convictions are well-placed, even though my lifestyle would never allow me to share his position per se.",1280448584

He was a longtime professor at a public college (Queens College). (Full disclosure: I was a student at QC from 1986-1992. I never took a full class with Professor Hacker, but I heard him lecture a few times.) His classes always filled up quickly despite their reputation as challenging, he won numerous teaching awards and he was near-universally regarded as an inspiring lecturer. Nevertheless, he was also a respected scholar who regularly published articles and books that nobody in his field could ignore. It doesn't have to be either/or.",1280448559

There are many horror stories from folks doing hiring where they experienced applicants who seemed to lack the ability to write even simple, small applications. Granted, some of those situations could have been caused by pressure and nervousness, but other times it isn't. Some of those folks just can't code at all, but they applied anyway.",1280448506

Our entire business is based on making server management better, easier, and safer for you and we do everything we can to make our service infallible.<p>In fact, some of the initial inspiration for our dashboard was that existing tools made it too easy to accidentally kill the wrong machines. Some providers give nodes names that aren't exactly user-friendly, and without some basic sorting and labeling tools, eventually almost anyone would make a mistake. So, we added coloring, sorting, and renaming to mitigate that kind of user error.<p>Also, on the subject of security, we just added the ability to require multi-factor authentication to log in to your Cloudkick account. You can choose to require a YubiKey, one-time SMS code, or one-time email code to access your dashboard.

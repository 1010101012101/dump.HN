7436862,comment,7435720,7436593,1,0,mcguire,,,"Very true. However, network effects at the scale of an individual decision are weak. If I am considering taking some package proprietary, adding a feature, and selling the modified package, I am faced with the decision of whether or not to give myself a strong, if temporary competitive advantage. Sure, the original package may catch up with me, but if I play my cards right I&#x27;ll be playing Scrooge McDuck in my basement vault by that time. Further, the catch-up date can be delayed if I hire as many smart people from the package as possible to work on my fork.<p>Or, it may never catch up, if fragmentation (or any other effect) destroys the market for the product in the mean time. I&#x27;ve wondered if that had any role in the rise and fall of Lisp machines; I&#x27;m a little too young to have direct experience there.",1395334784

Not being able to effectively cure cancer isn&#x27;t the issue Silicon Valley is facing. As others have said, as software engineers, we would have gone to school to do bioinformatics and study the natural sciences if that&#x27;s what we wanted. The issue is that a vast number of people are working on shitty, pointless, worthless apps.<p>It has nothing to do with barriers to entry. What kind of problems do you learn to solve in this field? Computational ones, i.e. things involving facets of computing. So why are less companies devoting resources to working on facets of networking, optimizing computer architecture, writing more efficient compilers and operating systems? Things that software engineers should have plenty of knowledge on, and would be much more beneficial to society than the next bullshit social app. Why is this not the case?<p>That is what the author is addressing. Churning out photosharing app #35875 isn&#x27;t helping anyone.

A world with only free software is still one sided.<p><i>The act of being proprietary adds no value to any software. It only serves to take away potential value in the ability to trust, understand, reuse, and modify it.</i><p>There isn&#x27;t always a need to actually understand, reuse and modify a software if the user only wants to use it. Proprietary software cannot be studied and trusted fully -- that&#x27;s true, but if there is no free alternative competitive sacrificing is how we live in this world.<p><i>You probably (assumptions here) have done no part to fund or participate in the continued development of LibreOffice, while you have paid Microsoft for their Office suite. You are directly incentively the continued usage and development of proprietary software without doing anything for the free alternatives. Even if you have contributed to LibreOffice in some way, you are still sustaining the proprietary freedom depriving Microsoft suite through both your purchase and usage of it.</i><p>Using a software is already participating in the continued development of LibreOffice.<p>If I could take a train to get to work in 15 minutes, why would I bike for 45 minutes to work every day? I may bike occasionally, but definitely not everyday. If LibreOffice is convinent to do everything I need to do with MS Office, I&#x27;d switch permanently. If not, they will both co-exist on my computer.<p>How will removing MS Office do any good to free software if I don&#x27;t actually write code for LibreOffice in the first place?<p>Is there not enough people already writing code and plugins for LibreOffice suite? Sounds like free software moment is pushing people to write free software because they don&#x27;t have enough developers who are willing to put time writing code for free software.<p><i>Implicit to Steam is a violation of (at least) one of those freedoms. You are free to not consider them freedoms in your ethical outlook.</i><p>That&#x27;s why free software movement from R.S. is radical to me.<p><i>It isn&#x27;t about forcing anyone to do anything, it is about removing the force already imparted upon you by proprietary software vendors that restrict your ability to modify or redistribute software.</i><p>The force imparted upon me is due to the fact the free alternatives aren&#x27;t good enough or just don&#x27;t exist. If there exists one that works really well, like proprietary software, the force is not as strong as you think.<p>If we shall, free software is awesome, it has the ability to study and modify the software in any way the user wants, now, how do I make a living off my work?",1395334434

7436823,comment,7436401,7436654,14,0,jwatzman,,,"Engineer working on Hack here.<p>Yeah, I think Hack is a good language to start a new project in. For as much flak as PHP gets, there are actually a lot of good things about the language. The fast development cycle -- edit php script, refresh -- is something amazing that you don&#x27;t get in a lot of statically typed languages, which usually have a compilation step. The crazy dynamic things you can do also occasionally have their place, though it&#x27;s certainly easy to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>On the other hand, a lot of the time you want the safety that strong static typing can give you. Even just the null propagation checking can immediately find tons and tons of silly little bugs without even running the code, and ensure that the code stays consistent as a &quot;mini unit test&quot; if you will.<p>Hack hits the sweet spot of both. Wiring the Hack typechecker into vim was really revolutionary for me -- having both the immediate feedback of the type system for all the silly bugs that I was writing, along with the fast reload/test cycle from PHP, is great.",1395334423

I mean, I &quot;understand&quot; logistically: they already had a giant codebase in PHP, migrating a codebase is expensive, and it&#x27;s difficult to hire and train 1000s of hackers in e.g., OCaml. (They <i>do</i> have some OCaml people, but they are outliers. OCaml was my favorite thing to write there, though it didn&#x27;t afford some of the same niceties and interactivity as the PHP code they had, only because the support was down by several orders of magnitude.)<p>But at the same time, layering FP with a home rolled static type checking server (??) is bug prone and is certainly yak shaving (which they have time and money to do). Now they&#x27;ve written (1) a compiler to C++, (2) a compiler to VM byte code, (3) a corresponding runtime for each, (4) extensions to PHP, (5) a type checker, and (6) an inference engine. That&#x27;s a lot of stuff. And in the end, it&#x27;s still PHP, which is duly disliked. (Though Facebookers don&#x27;t seem to care. The prevalent attitude toward it is that &quot;PHP, as it&#x27;s coded here, is mostly like C++, and that&#x27;s OK.&quot;)<p>Writing correct type checkers and inference engines is kind of difficult. They seemed to take the approach of just building onto it incrementally until it just seems to work. That approach led to many bugs in many cases that just simply aren&#x27;t thought of when one is trying to build inference engines by hand, as opposed according to theory. Type checking and inference is an area ripe with theory and attached formal, mathematical semantics. Standard ML&#x27;s standard is perhaps the most infamous; it&#x27;s a collection of mathematical statements about the language. That way, the compiler is now almost an engine to prove your code is correct. I don&#x27;t see how the same guarantee can be made with something that is just cobbled together.",1395333633

In order to ease conversion, we just assume the programmer knows what they are doing with untyped functions and let anything pass.<p>If all of your code is in strict mode, then we believe the type system to be sound. We haven&#x27;t done any formal proof of this of course, and there have been plenty of bugs in the past. But that&#x27;s the goal.<p>Some types are enforced at runtime -- just like PHP5 enforces class type annotations on parameters. However, at least for now, the runtime doesn&#x27;t do a lot of the clever things with the type system that the static typechecker does. It&#x27;s much more conservative with using the type information, and doesn&#x27;t do things like check generics at all. (At least right now! We probably will change this in the future.) This means that we can play a little more fast and loose with the type system in the static parts; we want it to be sound, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be right now; it&#x27;s not going to cause a JIT crash or anything.<p>There are more details on the modes here: <a href=""http://hacklang.org/manual/en/hack.modes.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacklang.org/manual/en/hack.modes.php</a>",1395333249

I&#x27;ve been involved with several organizations which try to avoid GPL code, by policy, in favor of MIT/BSD because it raises too many issues.

There has been much debate on GPL vs MIT-style licenses and I believe both have their place.<p>Now, as far as OSS vs open-to-view-but-not-use, it&#x27;s a different point. The problem is that you can have something like Android where Google has lots of control over where the software actually runs. Technically nothing would prevent you from forking it, putting together your own hardware and running a completely open platform that will compete with Google. Practically, it would cost you a lot of money. I actually think that CyanogenMod is a counter-example to this for Android: it is an open build of Android for the devices that support it. In reality, the problem with Android devices is not Android-the-OS. It&#x27;s the closed bootloaders and the hardware that supports them. If only every phone&#x27;s bootloader was as permissive as the BIOS on PC&#x27;s (EFI notwithstanding), we wouldn&#x27;t be complaining about this. You get your Moto X, nuke the Motoblur crap, install your favorite Android distro and you are good to go.<p>Another example: would you classify WordPress as free software? Most people do. The reality is that it is very tightly controlled by Automattic which has its own roadmap that is often times not public. You submit a patch to them, they sit on it, then produce their own solution in the next release that does things completely differently.<p>In the end, the license can do very little to prescribe governance of a project and that&#x27;s what things most often come down to: who is in charge and how flexible are they? So we can debate the finer points of licenses or even what to call those licenses or we can write useful software where the source is available and others are free to run it and fork it.",1395333006

It may even enhance your short-term freedom by letting you focus on other things.<p>However, the fact remains that if you dislike something about GMail (the ads, the way it renders ASCII art, or maybe you wish it supported OpenPGP encryption), you are powerless to do anything about it. This also means that if GMail changes in some way you don&#x27;t like (e.g. the recent UI changes), you have no choice but to accept them. If one day they decide to forbid normal attachments and force everything to go into Google Drive... well that&#x27;s just too bad.<p>Basically, your choices always boil down to &quot;take it or leave it&quot;, where leave it means migrating (or losing) your mail and learning to use a new app. This is not a trivial undertaking, even for a skilled user.<p>When you further consider how many people are putting their eggs in the same basket, these issues (especially the privacy concerns) become much more worrying. GMail, through its market dominance, is actively holding back the adoption of encryption and actively harming the privacy of entire nations. This wouldn&#x27;t be a concern if it were free software people ran in a decentralized fashion.<p>Free Software comes with its own issues - running your own software and maintaining it does incur a cost. But with Free Software you have the option of doing things yourself or hiring someone to help you out. With non-free software, you don&#x27;t have that choice.<p>How important these issues are to you personally will of course vary. But that doesn&#x27;t mean Free Software supporters are wrong to believe these are problems worth spending time and effort on fixing. Raising awareness is of course a necessary part of that.<p>(disclaimer: I work on <a href=""https://www.mailpile.is/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mailpile.is/</a>, a Free Software project which aims to offer many of the features of GMail with strong emphasis on privacy/security, so I feel pretty strongly about this.)",1395332951
7436586,comment,7435720,7436130,5,0,chriswarbo,,,"Stallman&#x27;s goal is not to prohibit proprietary software; but to have a world where most people choose Free Software (whether they&#x27;re aware of it or not), so that it would be difficult to convince anyone to use proprietary software.<p>Compare this to our current situation, where everyone&#x27;s so used to clicking &quot;I Agree&quot; on an EULA screen before they can use a program that many Free Software programs (most famously Firefox) started including such screens, even though there is no requirement to agree to any terms before using them! Of course, there are usually terms related to redistribution and re-use of the code, but that can be done without ever seeing such a screen.<p>Stallman doesn&#x27;t disagree with BSD/MIT licenses; he only advocates the GPL as a short-term measure to get to the goal quicker. BSD/MIT code is (usually) a valued contribution, as it lifts everyone up equally; Free Software is lifted, but so is proprietary software since it is trivial for anyone to repackage it as proprietary. That&#x27;s fine if your goal is to advance the state-of-the-art, give unimpeded access to better security, get your ideas out there, etc. but it doesn&#x27;t do very much for (or against) the goal of having mostly Free Software.<p>The only way to go the other way and turn proprietary software into Free Software is by a dedicated effort on the part of the copyright holder (who may be dead!). Hence the playing field is heavily biased in proprietary software&#x27;s favour, which endangers the mostly-Free goal. The GPL tries to rebalance things by going the other way.<p>In a mostly-Free world, this bias would (hopefully) be counteracted by the inertia of Free Software, so the GPL would be unnecessary and the more permissive licenses would be a better choice.<p>Notice that Open Source didn&#x27;t feature in the paragraphs above, since it&#x27;s unrelated. That&#x27;s Stallman&#x27;s argument: it misses the point. He doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s intrinsically bad, although it may cause indirect harm to Free Software through distraction and confusion. Of course it also does indirect good, by leading people to Free Software who would never have been exposed to a purely Free Software message.",1395332946

The rule was there was one fifteen-meeting standup meeting daily, and otherwise all team members were freed from meetings - they worked on delivering software 80% of the time.<p>Most communications were short impromptu discussions in the product room related to the current sprint, where devs could talk to the product owner, or the business analysts, or the testers, (who were all living in that room too),  or the come-and-go liasons that were protecting the core team from meetings with the outside organization, etc.<p>Sometimes the impromptu discussions led to longer design or requirements discussions as the product owner/biz analysts taught the solution domain to the developers, or the developers explored the constraints or opportunities to rework parts of their architecture to the product owner.  These were focused primarily on the current sprint needs with an eye on the overall backlog to detect if big features were coming, or there was a need for a major refactoring or architectural change.  I wouldn&#x27;t call these &quot;meetings&quot;:  these really were &quot;design sessions&quot;, probably the most integral part of building working software.<p>After each two-week sprint there were 3 meetings:  on Friday, a one-hour demo for outside executives to see progress, a one-hour post-mortem (&quot;how would do do things better, what technical debt did we accumulate, etc.&quot;) , and on Monday, a two-hour planning session for the next sprint (which replaced the usual standup).<p>That&#x27;s 8 hours of &quot;management meetings&quot; in an 80 hour period, or 10%.   Not bad, in my experience.   The other 10% would be for personal stuff that happens (doctor&#x27;s appointments, everyone gets distracted by a YouTube video, mandatory town halls, etc.)<p>So, combine the above with a bunch of stickies on the wall to track progress, a backlog of features,  and (most importantly) a product owner with authority to make decisions... that&#x27;s Scrum, in my experience.   There&#x27;s really not a lot to it.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is what you likely experienced.  What did you experience that you hated?   The hardest part is having a product owner take responsibility for the priorities & trade-offs, that also has enough clout or political protection in the broader organization to make (potentially wrong) decisions.   If you&#x27;re missing that, you get meeting explosion, as people point fingers and spin their wheels.",1395332688

Being a developer I know that the delivered value is not directly related to the number of hours, I really do and in fact I&#x27;m skeptical of the value delivered by people claiming to work long hours.<p>No, I would want exclusivity because focus is important and people (especially developers) cannot focus on multiple things at the same time, unless we&#x27;re talking about things that the contractor is very specialized in, has done those things repeatedly and has a track record to show for it. For CRUD stuff for example, I wouldn&#x27;t care. But for new, more difficult, more challenging problems that require focus and inspiration, then I would require exclusivity. On the types of problems that I currently work on, for example, I cannot focus on multiple things on the same day, or even the same week. Sometimes if I get distracted by conversations that are unrelated to what I&#x27;m working on, my whole day is fucked because then I have to remember the context I was in and I&#x27;m already tired and out of my zone and I can&#x27;t get back anymore, ending up staring at the laptop with a stupid look on my face. I have days in which I notify everybody that I need to get work done and don&#x27;t want to be interrupted, unless there&#x27;s an emergency.<p>Sometimes I envy devops, or CRUD developers, or other types of freelancers that can rely on experience to place themselves on autopilot or that can deliver value in a short amount of time.

The entire proprietary software industry can only exist through the existence and practice of copyright law. Nothing about copyright law has anything to do with the usual tenants of free markets - voluntary exchange, property rights, and informed transactions. It is just made up rules with (maybe) good intentions and catastrophic consequences.<p>> Why should we label proprietary software as enemy?<p>Because it violates Richard Stallmans, and anyone who agrees with him (so at least the entire FSF and GNU project) ethics.<p>> I also think proprietary softwares have value.<p>The act of being proprietary adds no value to any software. It only serves to take away potential value in the ability to trust, understand, reuse, and modify it. The only exception is software that only functions through its obfuscations, such as DRM, and that entire class of software is implicitly anti-user and only functions to take away more freedom.<p>> but at the moment this is not easy to achieve.<p>The ease of accomplishing something should never be just cause to work for or against it.<p>> because the features in LibreOffice is still lagging behind. I will be happy to dump Office completely if LibreOffice continue to improve.<p>You probably (assumptions here) have done no part to fund or participate in the continued development of LibreOffice, while you have paid Microsoft for their Office suite. You are directly incentively the continued usage and development of proprietary software without doing anything for the free alternatives. Even if you have contributed to LibreOffice in some way, you are still sustaining the proprietary freedom depriving Microsoft suite through both your purchase and usage of it.<p>> I don&#x27;t see this as a violation of my freedom.<p>Free software has three tenants - the ability to study, modify, and share software. Implicit to Steam is a violation of (at least) one of those freedoms. You are free to not consider them freedoms in your ethical outlook.<p>> But I don&#x27;t think everyone should be told to use free software.<p>It isn&#x27;t about forcing anyone to do anything, it is about removing the force already imparted upon you by proprietary software vendors that restrict your ability to modify or redistribute software. Richard Stallman (probably) doesn&#x27;t give a shit if you use emacs or a competitor, as long as both are free, or at the <i>least</i> that you understand that you are sacrificing your freedoms to use convenient proprietary alternatives.",1395331846

Heck, I had a &quot;768p&quot; monitor in the 90s!<p>However, it is not only difficult to find higher resolution screens, it is almost impossible to know what resolution they are!<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook 14 (http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/business/devices/hp-14-chromebook.html)  lists its screen as &quot;14&#x27;&#x27; 200 nit display with 16:9 aspect ratio&quot;. Why the hell HP thinks &quot;nits&quot; is more important than pixels puzzles me.<p>Or take Dell as another example. I challenge you to find a screen resolution specified in pixel over there. Usually they say &quot;HD+&quot; (for the infamous 1366x768) or FHD (probably 1920x1080, which is decent). I saw a laptop that I liked, but its screen was listed as &quot;HDF&quot;. Was it a typo or some lesser resolution? I don&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;m not willing to pay hundreds of dollars to find out.<p>Is it only me or doesn&#x27;t anybody care about screen resolution anymore?<p>I don&#x27;t have the budget for a MacBook Air, and one would be overkill anyway.

7436362,comment,7435212,7436122,2,0,lmm,,,"> Now, Scala has many features; which of them, do you think, are the largest contributors to that adoption?<p>Low-boilerplate syntax is certainly a big plus, but I think the biggest feature of scala is that it makes it easier to handle cross-cutting concerns without stepping out of the language. Concretely: a consistent, natural syntax for async calls; better ways of handling errors (validation monad), dependency injection without reflection. And almost as important is the ability to construct DSLs in the language itself (e.g. spray&#x27;s routing syntax); I know at least one company where this was the primary rationale for adopting scala.<p>So I think higher-kinded types are a key feature, even if to start with users are only using the libraries built on top of them (you can do specific bodges like C#&#x27;s async/await without them, but to have a consistent, extensible syntax that does collections, async calls, and error handling you really need the higher level of abstraction), as are implicits and dependent types (both vital for DSLs). And there were certainly times when I found myself wishing for macros before they existed. Some users might come for the syntax or the traits (though I think error-handling and good async abstractions are at least as appealing, particularly in finance where a lot of the adoption is happening), but you stay for the type system.",1395331302

They are both quite promising companies, but are working on different directions.<p>Rocket Fuel Inc. is an ad-targeting company, they have very large scale systems (which I have interest on), and AI problems. I imagine there are many work related to 1) scaling the system 2) building tools for analyzing data and automation 3) AI-related algorithms and developments.<p>Palantir Technologies on the other hand is working on something really unique that few are working on but have great value and potential. I would imagine it deals with many new technology challenges that is completely new and few have seen or heard before. The company is super famous, and hires super talented engineers.<p>I heard a theory that computers can empower human in 2 ways (Automation and Augmentation), I see Rocket Fuel is doing really good on automation, while Palantir is working on Augmentation. They both create great value, and are both very appealing to me, but I have a thought that the consumer web sector is bit outdated now.<p>So I am having headache on which company to choose. What I look for is:\n1) a place where I can apply my CS skill on, an opportunity to join a team to create great value\n2) work that helps me improve, and lead me to my next goal (possibly join smaller start-up, or build my own start-up)\n3) network and make friends with great engineers, designs, product managers, etc. so that I could be more exposed to startup opportunities.",1395331284

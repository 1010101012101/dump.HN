You'll probably notice that you max out 2GBs a lot.  If you do any kind of virtualization, you definitely need 4GB so you can allocate a decent amount of RAM to your virtual machine.  If you aren't doing any virtualization... why not?<p>A previous poster is correct that you do need to buy two sticks.  Also, I would hold on to your Apple memory just in case.  Even though installing your own RAM is ok, you'll want to pop back in the Apple memory before you send it in for service.  There's no guarantee they wont swap out your RAM for new Apple RAM while they are trying to diagnose the problem.",1246823927

But, the code will prove a nigh-unmaintainable disaster that will required all sorts of time later when a new feature is requested or bugs start creeping out.<p>There are times when a good programmer will take considerably longer than a bad programmer, and might spend time futzing around with different implementations, moving code around, creating various data structures, etc.<p>Depending on the task, I would argue that can be a good thing. The good programmer is attempting to understand and present a clear conceptual model of the problem and solution in his code; the mediocre programmer might just create a litany of special cases for the cases specified <i>right now</i> just so they can get that particular program behind them.<p>Although the mediocre programmer might produce code faster, I would argue the good programmer is still 10x more productive, because he has done that much more <i>thinking</i> than the mediocre programmer. Perhaps when you refer to futzing, you mean changing the code just for the sake of another commit to show management, where nothing is learned and nothing is improved.<p>Also, a good programmer might come back two months from now, with the knowledge he gained from some other project, and make a change to the program that tangibly improves it for the better. The mediocre programmer will have put all that behind them; it is not on their list of projects and requirements, therefore they won't bother, nor will they bother even mention it to anyone.<p>But, I suspect this sort of comparison of timespans varies with size, and with the difficulty of the problem space.<p>And yeah, N^2 different answers. :-)",1246822698

Corruption and collusion between fat cats and government.<p>The cards will be hacked and sold on the black market almost immediately upon being released (if that ever happens -- it probably won't even after billions of rupees have been spent). Hence they'd make ID fraud and terrorism easier, not harder.<p>The article mentions 20 different forms of ID which are currently recognised. This sounds better to me. Historians, for example, prefer several pieces of evidence which can be cross-referenced to support a story rather than just one piece.<p>Just as it's not a good idea to allow private companies to collect data on people without their explicit consent, so it's a bad idea to let the government do so. Actually, it's an important check on government power not to let this happen. And I think many politicans involved in such schemes realise that ID projects won't reach completion.

Less hassles, less issues, less crashes than linux or windows. And when you have lots of people saying the same thing, its not 'high ground' its a result of having a unix based OS that you don't have to waste your time to have it work.<p>I switched to OSX after using linux as my primary OS for about 5 or 6 years, and the big difference for me was that I didn't have to spend valuable time actually getting osx to work. Linux is amazingly customizable which can be great, but when it comes to getting work done all I care about is having a terminal, vim, and being able to run a local server to test my work. Anything else that I have to configure is just getting in my way.<p>Edit: As much as I like OSX, there is only only app that I actually require that is OSX specific, and that is quicksilver, which for me completely changes my workflow and allows me to productively use a 13"" laptop as my primary development machine without the need for an external monitor. I think also goes to show my point, that OSX doesn't necessarily have any spectacular features or applications that draw me too it, but really its the fact that it is a unix based OS that I can use without hassle.",1246822061

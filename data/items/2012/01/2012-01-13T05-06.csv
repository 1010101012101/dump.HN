3459368,comment,3458376,3458906,3,0,ricksta,,,"Actually my original algorithm did exactly that. The problem with that approach is the amount of energy required to change the cell voltage by 0.1V goes up exponentially once it's below 3.5V, where the charge curve flattens out. An example would be a 40% state of charge battery could be 3.30V and a 60% state of charge battery would be 3.33V. When the batteries are usually about 1-3% difference in SoC, it become very difficult to balance them based on just looking at the voltage alone. The measuring error is probably more than the actual voltage difference. That why I decided to not bother balancing the battery once they are below 3.5V.<p>The numbers I'm getting is for LiFePo4. There are many other chemistry of Li-on variant, and LiFePo4 so far is the safest. It does not burn up like the ones in your laptop, but at the cost of slightly less energy density.<p>The type of batteries we had in our EV was these ones made by Winston Battery:

I mean, no one likes to die but if we look at it objectively - death is one of the very effective ways in which society changes from old ideas to new ideas. In a hypothetical scenario where every generation lives till 120, I would assume that current US congress will probably continue with the same members for so long (if you notice, most of them keep getting re-elected so many times).

That will be a great resource to people as more and more web datavis moves away from ActionScript and to Javascript.<p>Regarding Raphael, I think g.Raphael is a pretty high level interface for creating charts.  It's find of on the level of protovis, which was what Mike Bostock was working on before he started d3, basically a declarative approach to chart generation.  With d3, he went much lower level.

In general, whenever you have many front-ends sharing a back-end service (in this case syslog), some flow-control is necessary - and UDP with no flow control will one day come back to bite you.<p>Consider an attack or peak load event on the front-ends, now in addition to the direct capacity problems that that may induce, you also impact your backend and control-planes by flooding a network or service with uncontrollable UDP.<p>As others have noted; it would be better to use non-blocking TCP I/O with some bounded queuing for retries. It's also generally a good idea to use a LIFO queue, so that when the backend is restored after an outage, the recent data takes priority over old data (for logging information the health of the live system is most important).",1326433337

But forward-consistency and early access are both valuable for site-makers, so pre-standardized features are prefixed in case they change when the standard comes out.<p>If you want to <i>use standards</i>, you need to select what's available to you by your target audience, and ignore the non-standard-compliant cases.  If you want to <i>do things</i>, and keep as large a target audience as possible, you need to either hack them together with old tech or jump through hoops to do it with new tech.  Especially given the web's rocky past, many developers would prefer to use the new stuff.  And there are tools to help - Less or Scss, for instance, make those prefixes essentially free.<p>But that's just a fact of programming in general - you could write a web-app and get it on any computer with a modern browser.  Or you could write it in Ruby, and get it on any computer with a Ruby interpreter, and include an installer / instructions for those that don't.  Or you could write it in C, and get it on any computer with a C compiler, and you may have to write your own library code / preprocessor controls to handle strange architectures, and change things based on your target OS.  Or you could write it in assembly, and have it run on almost anything, but have to handle multiple flavors and an endless variety of available memory, and input and output devices.<p>Or do any of the above, pick a subset of the devices that are technically capable of reading your code, and screw the rest.  Porting Doom 3 to Commodore 64 probably isn't going to work, despite the code being written to the standard of whatever language it was written in (probably C, which I will assume for now), and compilers adhering to the same standard for targeting the C64.  That you can't run Doom 3 on your C64 doesn't mean the standard is broken or useless.<p>--<p>The nice thing about those prefixes is that, in general, it means you can use new features and know they'll work as you designed for <i>years</i> to come.  If a re-design every year or so is cheaper than vendor prefixes, then yes, they're a pain - wait until the standard comes out.  If not, they're a time saver to get handy new features a couple years early, <i>and</i> free switch-over to the standard when and where it's implemented.",1326432084

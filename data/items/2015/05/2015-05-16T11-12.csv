For instance: free lifelong quality education to all. But naturally, elites would rather waste society&#x27;s wealth on wars (international killing) and prisons (the most jailings in the world)... than silly things like knowledge and healthcare.<p>Affirmative action is a modest, successful effort to chip away at the self-destructive inequalities of society.

This is a good question that I think a lot of Python fans might wonder about.<p>One of the many great things about Python (and other &quot;dynamic&quot; languages) is how flexible it is in so many ways. Instead of forcing you to be more explicit, make more decisions, and lock more things down in advance, it lets you get away with telling it to figure out a lot of things for itself while the program is running.<p>This kind of flexibility isn&#x27;t free. It does a lot of things indirectly, it makes decisions for you and, if they turn out to need changing, it makes those changes as, and so on, while it is running, which requires a lot of computation.<p>You actually could compile Python, but keeping the &quot;exact syntax&quot; presumably means keeping all of Python&#x27;s capabilities to be flexible at runtime, so compiling would require essentially building a lot of the Python interpreter right into your compiled app. This, in itself, would just change the packaging and wouldn&#x27;t buy you much in terms of performance. A lot of clever people are looking for ways to speed up Python without removing features, but it will probably never be possible to make Python as fast as Rust will eventually be, nor to make Rust as convenient as Python.",1431777199

In the circumstances of passenger flights, keeping current solutions is likely a conservative and more pragmatic approach.<p>With regards to my comment, I do not expect autopilots to substitute pilots. Instead, I expect that they should be able to handle additional tasks assigned from the pilots.<p>For example, it was not a passenger flight, but a helicopter crashed in Nepal during the rescue from the earthquake. I wonder if its pilot had fore-warning from sensory information prior to the crash; and if they had not, how to design its warning system and if an autopilot could take control of  the helicopter to land it safely.<p>The sources I have read on passenger pilots use of autopilots is:

The latter we&#x27;ve known all along because these schools openly state that they embrace affirmative action.<p>The matter of fact is that the school is incredibly strategic in how it makes its admissions decision, taking into account not only race, but geography, and a whole host of other factors. The complaint is utterly silly, because it fails to realize that nowhere is the claim made that the admissions process seeks to select the best students according to the SAT -- it seeks to select the students who best add something novel to that year&#x27;s entering class.<p>A VERY STRONG argument could be made that race ought to be something which can&#x27;t enter into that calculus. And I agree with that. But, from the moment a school adopts Affirmative Action (and the US supreme court upholds it), then this is just the sort of thing we can expect to see.",1431776063

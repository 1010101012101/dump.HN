The bad news is that there&#x27;s no standard of probable cause or anything remotely like it: more or less the only thing the FISC is actually even <i>supposed</i> to review and rule on is the likelihood that you are not a US citizen or in the US. The good news is that they still have to issue that FAA 702 order, and fewer than 2000 FAA 70* orders have been issued in any year prior to this one. (That number includes 702s along with other orders which can intentionally target US citizens or residents but involve a higher burden of proof.)<p>That still leaves the possible loophole of having those 2000 orders cover a huge number of people in a manner similar to the Verizon metadata order (which <i>is</i> a FISA order, but <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a FAA 70* order and isn&#x27;t counted among the 2000 <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5879366"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5879366</a> ). But this Facebook disclosure along with earlier statements from Google and others allows us to cautiously rule that out (though we probably don&#x27;t have the same clarity on the situation of all 9 PRISM firms).<p>Of course, none of this tells us much about what they&#x27;re doing (or able to do) using &quot;upstream collection&quot; at the telcos. Or indeed through similar &quot;direct collection&quot; from non-US Web companies running non-US servers, which I&#x27;m guessing (IANAL) would probably be outside US law altogether.",1371297518

While it is not the best text editor out there (I used to use Emacs for Ruby stuff), the IDE features are great and (for me) outweight some of the niceties that Emacs or Your Favourite Text Editor has. Symbol navigation works across libraries and the graphical debugger is great. Autocompletion could be better, but I understand how the dynamic nature of Ruby (and especially Rails, which uses a lot of metaprogramming magic to do its thing) makes it sometimes hard to do 100% accurately.<p>(I&#x27;m not affiliated with JetBrains, just a happy customer)",1371297181

Electronic, I have no idea, unless, IIRC, we get quantum about it. Old skool, chances are better. I, or a friend can observe my drop box or exchange, and so on.<p>Im not saying there are no good electronic methods, I am saying that ultimately I&#x27;d be more comfortable not using them. Remember too, I am talking ultimate paranoia, life and death.<p>In the end of course the weakest link of all is the humans operating any system. I mean, the whole PRISM thing was blown by a human.<p>The other thing in my mind is that these days spooks expect and are geared up for electronic comms, not so human comms. Budgets slashed, less &quot;watchers&quot;, and men on the ground. Going olde skool is a sort of curved ball.<p>Also, I know paper. I can verify hiding places. I can watch people move. I am not good enough to review, completely and confidently, code and encryption software. I would have to trust programmers I dont know, in a climate where we believe the likes of GCHQ, NSA, etc have back doors and cracks. We are given to understand that these people are all over electronic comms. As far as I know, they have not penetrated writing paper and hiding holes. They are not invisible either. Maybe you and others are good enough to verify all the software, encryption and networking software and hardware sufficiently enough to trust your life to it. I know I&#x27;m not.<p>In short, if my life is on the line, I would go with what I know best. I know paper better than deeply complex mathematics and programming.<p>Besides, given the revelations, why even bother to risk it? Even before all this, I would laugh my nuts off at terrorists who were caught and convicted using electronic evidence. I thought them idiots for even touching a computer to arrange terrorism. I assume that now, they wont be so stupid. It was nice and easy for the authorities to plunder their computers and and electronic trail. Now their job just got harder.",1371296892

And its worth relative to other forms of capital (cash, land) continues to rise.<p>Consider what&#x27;s required to start a new business today. You need less cash than ever before. The limiting factor is most definitely skill. Not just obvious specialist skills, but the basic mindset that takes you from &quot;just punching the clock&quot; to &quot;seeking opportunities to help&quot;.<p>One reason wealth is concentrating is that the vast majority of people are woefully unskilled in the areas that matter now. This creates big pools of labor that have no leverage, which are naturally easy to exploit.<p>So the existence of growing wealth inequality is not proof that education doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s just as plausible that most people are mis-educated. And when you look at the original intent of our education systems, they were deliberately designed to produce obedient factory workers who could reliably follow simple directions.

A number of people, starting with Gerald Kulcinski in 1986, have proposed to explore the moon, mine lunar regolith and use the helium-3 for fusion. Recently, companies as Planetary Resources have also stated to be interested in mining helium-3 on the moon. Because of the low concentrations of helium-3, any mining equipment would need to process extremely large amounts of regolith (over 150 million tonnes of regolith to obtain one ton of helium 3), and some proposals have suggested that helium-3 extraction be piggybacked onto a larger mining and development operation.<p>(removed citation notes for readability)",1371295978

Fortunately I deleted my Facebook and LinkedIn accounts years ago, but losing Google services is going to hurt. It also feels a little futile since my country, like yours, participates in Echelon so I&#x27;m not sure how much material difference it really makes. However I have absolutely no control over US policy, and the only thing I can do is hope to motivate Google to lobby for a sane internet by showing them that they are directly affected by the US administration&#x27;s actions. That, and donate to the EFF.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because there&#x27;s a lot I really like about Google as a company, and I really think that they&#x27;re trying to push the bar when it comes to privacy (elliptic cryptography etc) and I love things like Project Loon.

It&#x27;s baloney.<p>The only way for them to prevent future crime is to turn the country into an Orwellian dystopia. 
The thing is that we don&#x27;t even know how effective these surveillance programs are, since the gov&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t release any data. Any time questions of efficacy rise, &#x27;they&#x27; say that these programs help catch terrorists, but they don&#x27;t give any concrete data.",1371294630

Drive around the Little Saigon area in Houston (or numerous other cities). You&#x27;ll see plenty of South Vietnamese flags flying. This, even though it&#x27;s been nearly 40 years since North Vietnam completed its conquest in April 1975.<p>There&#x27;s a selection bias at work here, of course; the people who fled South Vietnam and came to the U.S. were, by and large, people who were aligned with, and benefited from, the South Vietnamese government.<p>Still, it speaks volumes that so many South Vietnamese fled -- by small boat, and who knows how many of them drowned at sea or were killed by pirates.<p>The North Vietnamese had heavy logistical support from the USSR and China.  After Watergate and Nixon&#x27;s 1974 resignation, the U.S. Congress -- controlled by the Democratic Party, whose base by then was heavily influenced by left-wing &quot;peaceniks&quot; -- cut off logistical support for the Saigon government. (Foreign policy wise, the Democratic Party of today is very, very different from that of the 1970s.)  The cut-off of U.S. support was pretty much game over for South Vietnam.<p>Some argue that the quick collapse of the Saigon government suggests that the government didn&#x27;t enjoy broad popular support among the South Vietnamese people. Another possible explanation is that the South Vietnamese were tired of war and saw no point in sacrificing their lives in the face of overwhelming military force.<p>I do think there&#x27;s considerable room for argument that, after the Japanese surrender and evacuation from Vietnam in 1945, the U.S. should have backed Ho Chi Minh and his Vietnamese nationalists, instead of supporting a return of the French colonial rulers (who were booted out after losing the French-Indochina War 1950-1954).  There&#x27;s also no question that the Saigon government was far from ideal.<p>But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any dispute that --- on the whole --- the (Communist) North Vietnamese government was far more systematically brutal than was the South. Indeed, systematic brutality seems to be a common and recurring theme among Communist governments. Which goes to my original point.",1371294334

As a &quot;solo developer&quot; I often have to face the problem that some people try to disturb my thinking and hurt me emotionally - by trying to make lasting associations between irritating things in my surroundings (or nearby) and something that I think, touch or handle while developing. I guess they have their reasons, but they can&#x27;t be honest.<p>My favorite development enviroment, Eclipse had started showing &quot;java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space&quot; errors. I felt sure that I had &quot;-XX:MaxPermSize&quot; set to defaults, but for some reason it wasn&#x27;t. It was lower. Now, the PermGen itself is &quot;permanent generation of objects in the VM (Class names, internalized strings, objects that will never get garbage-collected&quot;. Notice the part &quot;will never get garbage-collected&quot;.<p>Now, at the very same time I realized that something had changed in the file eclipse.ini I also realized that something had changed in my surroundings: somebody had kicked the trash can, which is normally attached to its place on the other side of the street (partially visible from my window). It was now laying on the asphalt. Somebody had also thrown a beer can on top of the bus stop shelter.<p>So, basically I had to choose between &quot;make my own hands dirty&quot; because of the trash (container and a single piece of trash) or &quot;wait for somebody else to take care of the issue&quot;. The trash can itself was recently taken away by city&#x27;s Environment services department and it seems that it didn&#x27;t even have any real use - or then (normal) people just carry their empty water bottles etc. themselves.",1371294136

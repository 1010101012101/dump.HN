They do two passes, in each pass they stain mouse brain cells in a particular region, then they kill the mouse, slice its brain, and image the slices.

It's not the concept, but the process that's the issue. Terms are too long, they have no requirement of actually bringing a patented idea to market, and they are transferable. It's the last one that is a huge problem to me.<p>We've turned patents into a tradable commodity that often have a lot more value as weapons than as mechanisms to defend an idea in the marketplace. The insane length of the protection only serves to make them more dangerous.<p>I support patent reform that addresses these issues, not the abolition of patents entirely.",1340427908

It's not like there has been much proven benefit from ICANN's oversight so far.<p>Imagine if it had been community-driven.  For instance, someone proposes "".foobar"" as a domain root.  Various contributors then submit comments on the proposal, including suggestions on established groups that ought to manage that domain and what the limitations are on sites in the domain.  Refinements are made (perhaps someone observes that "".foo"" would be a term that is recognizable in more countries and something that avoids offending anyone).  Finally a reasonable consensus is reached that having "".foo"" is actually more valuable than not having it, and its guidelines are made public under ""DNS RFC #613"" or whatever.  If that process can work for widespread things like protocols it can definitely work for deciding which domain roots are sensible.  We don't need an ICANN.",1340427892

Particularly M, N, S, W and 8.  My brain knows how to form the letter, but my fingers won't make the motions.  Usually I have to move the pencil back and forth in a line 6 or 7 times before the rest of the letter forms.  It's kind of embarrassing when someone is watching my sign my name since it starts with an M.  I have no idea where this came from, but it hasn't always been the case.",1340427675

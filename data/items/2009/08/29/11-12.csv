793073,comment,792920,793008,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""You're assuming we're talking about big, robust, powerful languages here.""<p>No I wasn't. I said "" anyone good enough to write robust, performant language <i>interpreter/compiler</i>"".<p>I said nothing about the <i>language</i> size. Small langauges can be very powerful.  <i>You</i> added the ""big"" adjective.<p>""If you have an idea (say, Erlang's actor-model-as-core) and want to try it out, writing a standard library is a big barrier to putting out something satisfactory enough for ""normal"" programming that others will want to tinker on your language and help it grow. ""<p>And do you really think that a collection of random algorithms in an untested language on a website would solve this problem for them?<p>The way to test out that idea would be to use an existing language (like Scheme,or C)  to build the interpreter or compiler for the language you have in mind instantiating the specific programming model you have in mind, write an <i>application</i> or two in your new language, and write the minimum amount of libraries you need, not build a ""standard"" library by <i>automatic</i>  translation from another language.<p>In the meanwhile you use some kind of FFI to access the underlying language/OS libraries. (e.g arc using PLT Scheme's networking libs).<p>Besides, the kind of algorithms a ""standard library"" has are not the ones built on the  site (fibonacci and ceasar's cypher in  a standard library)?<p>A ""standard library"" has collections, os interfaces, guis, regexes, networking libraries and so on. I don't see those kind of algorithms being portable across languages not to mention paradigms. Or were you thinking  that the new language would be a ""small and simple"" sequential object oriented language which is what the site's language seems to be?<p>I quote from the site<p>""Algorithmatic, by itself, is a small and simple dynamically typed Object Oriented programming language that serves as a common denominator among popular programming languages"".<p>Says who?<p>How do you define ""common denominator"" among  ""popular programming languages"" (like  C, C++,Python, Java , C#, javascript,  PHP, and Objective C)? I'd like to see a ""common denominator"" for such a language defined better. And assume you did design such a ""common denominator"", how would you go about automatically rewriting those algorithms to use an ""erlang actor model""?<p>As I understand  automatically converting a sequential non referentially transparent program to a concurrent one is  <i>still</i> a research topic. So your ""erlang actor model"" language won't necessaarily get any benefit from algorithms written  in this site's language anyway.<p>If I understand you right you are  saying that someone designing languages (like PG is doing with arc) will now go and write some kind of automatic translator from this site-specific language to their own to get a  ""standard library""?<p>I've <i>never</i> heard of <i>any</i> language designer anywhere ever doing that. It maybe that such things have happened and I haven't heard of it. Any real world <i>examples</i> (vs suppositions of what <i>could</i> happen in the future) you have of such an effort would contribute greatly to the discussion.<p>I <i>think</i>  (please correct me if I am wrong) that you are <i>hypothesizing</i> that such a thing <i>might</i> work vs having any successful real world examples of such an approach. I don't think there is a real problem language designers have that this site can solve.<p>If you have <i>any</i> examples of a language designer creating a <i>standard library</i> for his language  by writing a translator for algorithms written in another language and running that translator, please give citations.<p>And if someone were (crazy enough to)  to do something like this, I strongly suspect they would prefer to get some well tested algorithms written in the same language/paradigm ""family"" to ""port"" than some random collection of  algorithms in a vaguely defined  language on a random website.<p>IOW even if a langauge designer  were to create <i>another</i> dynamic object oriented language, he'd do better to attempt  porting  well tested  and robust smalltalk libraries than from (a future version of) this site.<p>As a thought experiment please imagine automatically converting smalltalk code to say Haskell, or Erlang. If that is too hard today why even bother with the silly algorithms on this site?<p>And I am not sure an automatic translation would work even in that case. Unless the new language were an exact clone of smalltalk, this ""automatic"" translation would have so many places the designer would jump in and  hand code stuff anyway, that it just wouldn't work out in practice.<p>I would really appreciate any counter examples of a language designer actually building a standard library like you claim  can be done.",1251546974

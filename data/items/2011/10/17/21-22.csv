You will get a male voice if you pick British English or French. (Siri uses the same voice as the screenreader. There is only one per language, unlike on the Mac where you can pick from different voices.)<p>What’s the underlying reason for Apple picking a female US English voice for VoiceOver? They probably bought the voice that whoever worked on it liked best and that also worked with the limited resources on the iOS devices.<p>The default voice for VoiceOver on the Mac is “Alex”, a male voice. It sounds much better than the iPhone’s voice, probably because a Mac can throw much more resources at voice synthesis. I bet the iPhone would use “Alex” as its US English voice if it had the chops to do so.<p>All the rest is the author’s silly imagination. Go ahead and ask Siri what sex it is.",1318888703

It starts with identifying points of interest in an image — the points, lines, and patterns that provide sharp contrasts or really stick out from a bland, featureless background. It’s similar in some ways to how the human eye picks out edges and points by keying off the places where there’s sharp contrast.<p>Then it looks at how these points are related to each other — the geometry of the whole set of points. You could picture it as looking like a constellation of stars, even though really it’s a more sophisticated mathematical model of these points of interest and how they relate.<p>Now it compares that model to all the other models in a huge database. Those other models come from images it has already analyzed from around the web. It looks for a matching model, but it doesn’t have to be a perfect match. In fact, it’s important that it be a bit flexible, so it doesn’t matter if it’s turned around, or shrunken, or twisted a bit. The Taj Mahal still has the basic geometry of the Taj Mahal even if you photograph it from a little bit of a different angle or photograph it lower in the frame. When Google recognizes that it matches that model best, it guesses it’s probably the Taj Mahal.</i>",1318888113

That said, I don't think we're reading commit logs for the same kernel.  I see two-liners routinely in the log (because checkpatch wants the shortlog and a body -- but note that these are often just rephrasings of each other).  And the kernel workflow encourages batching up what would otherwise be many small changes into well-formed patch sets, which means that you get a coarser granulatiry of changes than many projects.<p>And sure, there are patches that go in with elaborate analysis in the commit log.  Where those provide good information, I think they're great.  Most of the time, they just amount to a BUG() trace stuffed in for no good reason and I find them to be noise.<p>And I don't see how git blame helps my problem.  I have a regression, and an intuition of what kinds of changes might have caused it.  A commit log will tell me whether a commit seems like a good candidate to inspect.  Git blame just tells me who touched specific lines.  If I knew the specific lines to look at, I wouldn't <i>need</i> to be applying intuition here, I'd just fix the bug.",1318887621

Google doesn't ""sell"" Android, so there are no fees to extract -- and they'd be expensive to sue -- so rather than chase that ball, Microsoft looks for companies that are making money by selling devices that use Android. Microsoft holds patents for technologies used in the product and is asking for royalties. If a handset manufacturer and Microsoft can find terms they agree to, it makes sense to just license the technology and keep on moving down the road to making more money.<p>This, in and of itself, does not represent a broken system, IMO. Those who invent important technologies deserve to be compensated. Where the system is broken is in the award of patents for obvious solutions to problems. Or award of patents for systems that cannot be worked around, effectively granting an IP monopoly.<p>A major roadblock to changing the system lies in the fact that large companies have tremendous amounts of money invested in patent portfolios.

At the moment we’re not sure exactly how this is going to work, but the basic idea is this: We hope to make money by selling PDFs, print-on-demand books, and ebook versions of our pieces as well as from subscriptions to the print quarterly. That’s revenue. It will cost a certain amount of money to produce the Quarterly and run the web site, etc. That’s expenses.

Interestingly, very few of the authors I spoke to (basically 1) had any interest at all in that.  The ones who wanted money just wanted to get paid, not wait around for weeks or get quarterly royalty payment checks from back issues.  They just wanted to submit a piece and get paid.  Fair enough.<p>The push for 'community sharing of revenue' doesn't seem to come from the authors that I know.  Certainly, if we were talking about numbers with a couple more zeros at the end, they might care, but even people who write long form tech books generally don't do it primarily for the money, as they know they're not going to retire on royalties from a book on CouchDB.<p>P.S. - if you're interested in contributing pieces on advanced javascript or groovy, ping me at michael@jsmag.com<p>tl,dr - CQ might have taken off had there been an up-front commitment to kickstart the chicken/egg problem of content/readers by greasing the wheels a bit with some initial purchased content.",1318886571

Half of it might go on about `magic_quotes_gpc` and `mysql_real_escape_string` and other PHP4-tastic curios, and the rest won't even mention that because checking user input is seemingly only related to db communication.<p>I feel pretty strongly about it because I've seen people post code snippets for PHP, trying to be helpful, but the code is <i>dangerous</i>. They serve better as examples of exactly what you shouldn't do.<p>And the one thing PHP beginners (and intermediates) need is better, simpler explanations of responsible coding practices, and how it isn't hard to do at all (it's only tedious); because the sooner they know, the better.<p>I should write a book or something.",1318886489

I haven't seen any detailed figures about where their income comes from, but I'm guessing AWS is almost lost in the noise compared to what they make on retail directly and via their marketplace.<p>Moreover, I think cloud services is a much easier market for others to attack, and obviously some already do.

Too many people have made grand claims about how security/reliability/whatever is improved if you use cloud services compared to doing things in house, how much money you can save, how much faster you can be up and running, yada yada. And yet, we've seen numerous major outages now from even the big players, and plenty more complaints about pricing, lack of flexibility, etc. on top of those.<p>Basically, the cloud services emperor might not be naked, but he's close to indecent.

It makes more sense for me to have a single system for managing ruby dependencies than to do it with 3 or 4 different systems that work differently and may not be fully compatible. Plus, with bundler and rubygems I'm not stuck on whatever version the distro decides to support.<p>2. If I install something like the mysql driver manually or with apt-get, and then a year from now I'm no longer around and some other developer checks out the code ... how do they know which versions of the libraries were used? With bundler  all versions of all gems are checked into version control. This is a big win, and they can get a system with exactly the same versions of everything with a simple 'bundle install' after a clean checkout!<p>Edit:\n3. Also, there are likely to be C based python libraries you want to use that aren't maintained by your distro.

I'm not sure which is worse: a product owner who can't code, or a product owner who <i>thinks</i> he knows how to code.<p><i>""People who are not professional programmers often don’t realize how the difficulty of writing software increases with size.  Many people who wrote 100-line programs in college imagine that they could write 1,000-line programs if they worked at it 10 times longer.  Or even worse, they imagine they could write 10,000-line programs if they worked 100 times longer. It doesn’t work that way.  Most people who can write a 100-line program could never finish a 10,000-line program no matter how long they worked on it.  They would simply drown in complexity.  One of the marks of a professional programmer is knowing how to organize software so that the complexity remains manageable as the size increases.  Even among professionals there are large differences in ability.  The programmers who can effectively manage 100,000-line projects are in a different league than those who can manage 10,000-line projects.""</i>[1]<p>I had a product owner once who had an EE & signals background.

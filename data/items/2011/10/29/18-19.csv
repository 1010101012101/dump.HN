These permits are <i>voluntary, quid pro quo</i> (i.e., pay for service/access) payments.

Again, not illegal under the Constitution.<p>Marriage permits have been around since the 1200s.  They were originally established by the Catholic Church as a way to increase Church revenues.  Eventually, governments took over that power for the same purpose. For hundreds of years, in the West, marriage permits have been a recognized power of government.  Anybody can get married without a marriage permit in any State in America and live like man and wife (what is classically known as a ""common law marriage"").  However, if you want that marriage to be recognized by the government for legal and tax purposes, and get all the government-backed rights that come with government recognition, you need to pony up.

The search tool is an easy way for prospective college students to narrow down their list and research colleges.  Once they have a manageable list, they can create an account to manage the application process.  It's a crowded space and we've separated ourselves by building a better search and including content not available anywhere else, including graduate salary data and a personality wheel for individual colleges based on surveys completed by college students.  Users can get a sense for what students on campus are like, whether they trend Social, Scholarly or Indie.  High school users love this feature in testing.  You can also tap your LinkedIn (parents) and Facebook (HS students) profiles to see if you know any current students or on thousands of college campuses.<p>2) Getting the real scoop is harder:  so we built a searchable network of 1,110+ college students on over 260 campuses across the country.  Prospectives can search by college, interests (newspaper, ROTC, athletics, Greek life) and connect with a college student to get the real scoop.  After filling out some profile info, the first call/email is free.  Weve built a private, secure backend scheduling, call and email system to facilitate connections.<p>3) Getting in is the hardest: so we took a totally fractured industry, private college counseling, and aggregated the best in the business.  We partnered with IECA, the Independent Educational Consultants Association, to offer up the best consultants, as the market is ripe with marketing-heavy, results-light advisors.  So, if Im a student in Portland, Oregon who wants to go to Harvard I can search for a former Harvard admissions officer to help with my application process.  I dont have to use the counselor down the street that my friend recommended.<p>Any thoughts about UX, level of usefulness, and ways to reach high school students would be appreciated.

If I give BDB-Je too little heap, I run the risk of it not having enough space for buffers (for cleaner thread, for scanning through the entries). If I give Bdb too much cache, memory pressure becomes an issue.<p>So now there's 10-12gb of memory (per machine) that's neither use for caching data by BerkeleyDB itself, nor used for the OS page cache.<p>* The index takes up surprisingly much space. In most cases, the index still fits in memory -- but it could definitely be smaller.<p>* Couple of implementation issues that are being addressed by the BDB-Je team and aren't really Java specific. I won't go into them.<p>That said there are many pluses to BerkeleyDB JE:<p>* Log structured B+Tree. Awesome for use with SSDs. SSDs also make the penalty of going outside the in-memory cache much less costly, a random seek for reads is 0.2 ms, and due to log structures design random writes -- not very efficient on SSDs -- don't happen. Additionally, log-structured design means less wear on an SSD. That said, I'd still strongly suggest using an SSD even with a conventional B+Tree (e.g., MySQL InnoDB) -- but benchmark your application first.<p>* Avoids overhead of JNI<p>* As I've mentioned in my comment, being on the JVM means you can spend a lot more time thinking about concurrency.

But for the careers of certain individuals, it is a good thing. The harm may be so dispersed that they barely felt it or they are shielded from it altogether. Furthermore, they are fueled by our irrationality of perceiving rare, media-worthy like a terrorist attack as more important than many common death scenarios and the more common(and arguably more important) horror.<p>Keep in mind that organizations will either choose to expand, or disappears. If the US government choose the rational way for society and enlightened self-interest, it would have make itself disappear by unemploying themselves in the process. Of course, the government choose to makes job for the insider instead.<p>In some sense, this is what the party of the US government wanted and what terrorists desire. But if they aren't so wrapped up in the government or being a terrorist, they might have a different perspective.<p>It's like being a luddite at the dawn of the industrial revolution.

3172381,comment,3167710,3171257,3,0,azakai,,,"I agree in general that native decoders can be faster - they can in principle do anything a JS decoder can, and in addition the things you mention. However,<p>1. JS can also use hardware acceleration through WebGL. We have not done this yet, but will.\n2. JS has some proposed extensions, WebCL and Intel's RiverTrail, which let it utilize SIMD and other computing hardware. We will investigate using those too.<p>With those two things, we believe JS performance will be very good. How close it will be to native code, though, is hard to say at this point in time.<p>However, there is one big advantage a JS decoder would have, that native code does not: A JS decoder can be downloaded and run securely. As a consequence, you can continually improve your decoder in JS and your users will run the latest, most optimized version, while standard native decoders are typically upgraded much, much less frequently. Also worth noting is the potential to ship specialized decoders, as I mentioned in another comment, imagine an anime website that ships a video decoder heavily optimized for that specific type of content. That could be much more efficient than a stock native decoder.<p>Finally, it's worth noting that the decoder we compiled from C, Android's H.264 decoder, does not have any substantial amount of handwritten assembly. I had assumed like you said, that real-world decoders would have such things, and am curious why it doesn't. If anyone reading knows the answer I'd be very interested in that.",1319911225

Team-in-Training is an organization that raises funds for cancer research. To raise funds, they help individuals train for an endurance event like a marathon/triathlon. Over 80% have never done an endurance event before. The training is fairly intense and lasts three to four months.<p>The hard part about Team-in-Training is not the training, however. It is the fundraising. You actually sign a document - if you do not officially withdraw by a certain time, usually several weeks after training starts - that your credit card will be charged for the balance of your minimum fundraising obligation (whatever you do not raise).<p>For my event, there was a minimum fundraising obligation of almost $4,000. This was an order of magnitude and then some more than I've ever raised for any charity prior.<p>My argument about the $10 check was that I thought I had a good relationship with my parent's neighbor and that he would recognize the importance of what I was trying to do (personal growth and all that) and help support me (it is all 100% tax deductible) with a $25 or $50 donation.<p>As it turns out, going back to the idea of giving money as ""free speech"", the people who gave the most usually had a direct connection to leukemia or lymphoma in their family. And they wanted to support me in memory of their loved ones. It wasn't about me, it was more about them (and usually I didn't know that there <i>was</i> a connection until afterwards). As for my parent's neighbor with the $10 check, he didn't care for the cause (even though he is in that field) or, more importantly, for me and what I was trying to overcome/conquer/do/accomplish. It hurt but I eventually got over it. I know that getting asked for money is hard - but asking people for money is harder (you're putting yourself out there).<p>The triathlon was a life-changing experience. I ended up raising almost $6,000. I highly recommend TNT to anyone I encounter who ever says ""I wish I could run a marathon"" or ""I can't swim so I can't do a triathlon"" or ""I'm in a rut"" (marathons are their most popular event, by far).<p><a href=""http://teamintraining.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teamintraining.org/</a>",1330244664

3635127,comment,3634950,3634950,9,0,alister,,,">prompted the FBI to turn off about 3,000 GPS tracking devices that were in use<p>When I read the figure of 3000, I ricocheted between being shocked at the large number of people being tracked, then realized that it's actually tiny compared to the US population of 313M, and then back to be being dismayed that it's not so small after doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations.<p>Here's my thinking:<p>The US has 254M registered vehicles (Wikipedia), but cars are shared within families and the average family size is 2.6 (US census). If we further assume that a subject is tracked for about a month, the tracking device gets used on ~10 vehicles per year. Hence, 254000000/3000/2.6/10 = 3256.<p>So your chances of regularly riding in a ""bugged"" vehicle during the year are 1 in 3256. I have more than 3256 accumulated contacts in my email -- probably you do too.<p>Conclusion: It's very likely that you <i>know someone</i> who's vehicle is being tracked by the FBI <i>this year</i>.",1330243821

At the very least, printing through electronic media would have been worth an experiment.<p>Assuming the server were reasonably secure, and he'd taken appropriate steps to scale as time passed, the very fact of all that ink on one page would have made it completely illegible, and thus inconclusive evidence. Then, he could have just performed any Kira actions from a virtual machine with an encrypted filesystem, eventually ceasing any direct killings as his army increased in size. It would have scaled beautifully, and he'd have been almost perfectly anonymous.<p>To put the icing on the cake, if he didn't want to put in so much grunt work, he could have simply configured his server to automatically hook into every well-maintained reputable public listing of convicted violent criminals (as well as listings like the website of <i>America's Most Wanted</i>) and then forgotten about the whole thing. And hell, if the whole thing is automated, why not just put in a line of code that marks each death as being at the hands of the most likely intelligence agency? It would have achieved the same chilling effect (""OMG THE CIA IS KILLING EVERY CRIMINAL IN THE WORLD NOW!""), and thus the same goal, without even realistically risking his own livelihood.",1330243574

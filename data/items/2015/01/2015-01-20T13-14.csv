There are two better ways to improve security for sites like these, which are highly targeted and poor candidates for static sites:<p>1) Use a headless CMS. WordPress on the backend that provides and API which is consumed by a Node app, for example.<p>2) Shift any user-facing dynamic feature off the CMS.

We&#x27;ve held high-level positions at prestigious companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Scribd; we&#x27;ve invented and sold patents to the likes of Sony; and we&#x27;ve built, grown, sold, and taken companies to IPO.<p>Does that sound like something you want to be a part of? If so, what we&#x27;re offering you isn&#x27;t just a job. It&#x27;s an opportunity to become part of the core team in the early stages of our start-up. You&#x27;ll work directly with our CTO to lead and implement key aspects of our software development and build out our technology stack.<p>==ABOUT OUR COMPANY==
We run UndergroundCellar.com -- an e-commerce wine marketplace. But at our core, we are actually an internet technology startup that is applying our new e-commerce model to help wineries sell more wine and reach new buyers.<p>Discounts ruin brands and bastardize pricing structures. We&#x27;re here to protect wineries by providing them the technology to quickly move inventory and reach consumers through our new sustainable sales-channel that doesn&#x27;t rely on discounts. First we’re proving our model by gaining market share in the wine vertical -- but our sights are set high to roll this out across several other luxury verticals and ultimately to combine them all into a conglomerate luxury shopping marketplace.<p>==AVAILABLE ROLES==
All positions start as soon as possible. We are looking for candidates who have experience and enthusiasm for software engineering, web applications, databases, scalable systems, marketing, and user experience. Extra brownie points if you love wine!<p>ROLE 1: Frontend Engineer, Web and Mobile Apps
San Francisco, CA<p>You’re a master of web technologies Angular JS and Bootstrap, and can take our visual appeal to the next level, always designing with conversion optimization in mind. You can write (and maybe even speak) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fluently. You know how to build apps for iOS and Android. The Frontend Engineer will integrate designs for our wine offers into our website and mobile apps, as well as work with our designer to design the graphics for marketing campaigns and ad creatives, and continue to refine the overall user experience for our customers. With the help of our UX director and Marketing team, and in collaboration with other Software Engineers you’ll design user workflows, website structure and processes, and have the ability to transform these designs into actual responsive web and mobile apps.<p>ROLE 2: Backend Engineer, Web Platform
San Francisco, CA<p>You’re a master of the web technologies Node.js, PHP, SQL, and you’re thrilled by the thought of building massively scalable services leveraging platforms like Amazon AWS and Windows Azure. You write JavaScript and PHP fluently (Java, and/or C# experience is great as well). As our Backend Engineer, you’ll work directly with our CTO and Software Engineers to understand customer and business scenarios, and design and implement services and infrastructure that fulfill these needs.<p>==WHAT YOU&#x27;LL GET==
- Be a part of our core team
- Competitive cash & equity
- Work from our penthouse office in downtown San Francisco
- Lunch provided daily
- Transportation subsidy
- Gym membership
- Unlimited snacks and drinks while working (including wine)
- Fun place to work with a young and driven team<p>==Interested?==

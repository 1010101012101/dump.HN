8452793,comment,8450487,8451284,0,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Startup story booths.</i><p>Great idea, +1 to that...<p>I went to the last event in London and the thing I felt was missing most was social interaction between attendees who wouldn&#x27;t otherwise meet and hearing stories of other startups not (yet) in YC. This was mostly down to the attendees, which if you didn&#x27;t know anyone else could be a bit intimidating.<p>It&#x27;d be nice to see a few more social elements to encourage mingling - for example an open mic area to talk about your startup and solicit advice, discussion groups (or office hours) for different startup categories (travel etc) in smaller rooms so that people with similar interests could gather, or perhaps some kind of mini hackathons lasting 15 minutes on different subjects. Anything that lets people interact in a non-forced way.<p>People mingled at the drinks at the end to some extent, however that was pretty random I felt more group interaction earlier on would have helped break the ice a little more rather than simply leaving that to drinks etc. and my only regret about the event was that I didn&#x27;t speak to more people.<p><i>I would suggest to pepper these in between talks, after a few back to back talks the audience got a bit of an information fatigue, I think</i><p>Definitely - the talks were all in contiguous blocks, which meant by the end it was difficult to take it all in, though in London I loved Paul Buchheit near the end - he started to guffaws from some kids in front of me because of his gnomic delivery and by the end had them rapt. They do at least have the ones from the event online. More office hours between talks would be great - perhaps each speaker could give an office hours open to the floor?<p>Smaller talks to smaller groups (perhaps in parallel) would also work wonderfully, as having such a large audience makes the dynamic very different when it comes to questions and even for the speakers themselves. There are of course issues with that in terms of money and it&#x27;s already a free event.<p><i>More interaction with YC&#x27;ers and speakers.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think this is really possible, given the number of people in attendance. At the event in London speakers were mingling but were mobbed by hopefuls standing in rings around them and it all became a little odd and celebrity-focused, which I don&#x27;t think was the intention. Perhaps some people find this useful, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it added much given the ratio of speakers to attendees.<p>Great events though and cheers to YC for putting them on.",1413284171

I&#x27;m attempting to create a scraper for automating the most important events, as well as the most high profile posts, analysis, debates etc. on a these events from the most trustworthy sources.<p>Much of the workload and responsibility to create an awareness of the world around you lies with YOU. YOU have to be responsible enough to nuance your newsfeed. What if, somebody would create  executive summaries for the news around you, freeing up your time to live your life without worrying about missing out on the most important stuff?<p>Example: Everyone should know about ISIS, but very few people need the day to day development. Although it seems urgent to know that ISIS are pushing on Kubane right now, most people don&#x27;t really need this information package immediately. Instead, the advances on Kubane could be part of a holistic coverage. Who really knows what Kubane is anyway, and how it plays a role in the overall conflict wrapped in time and space since the first world war. The day to day notices does NOTHING to educate you, it only superficially satisfies your need for &quot;updates&quot;.<p>The best algorithm I have been able to come up with is to plot the number of &quot;mentions&quot; of a news story/information package (like&#x27;s tweets, different publications) against the duration of its presence in media. This would filter out Kardashian news and still list important events such as natural catastrophes, war conflicts and long-run intellectual debates on policy in government, enriching these events instead of sharing its spotlight with meaningless noise.<p>Any other ideas on algorithms?

It just isn&#x27;t especially common to refer to a specific person when you don&#x27;t know their gender. If historical authors did find themselves in that situation, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find them using singular &#x27;they&#x27;.<p>And it&#x27;s irrelevant beyond that, because even if historical authors turned out to do this all the time, it&#x27;s not likely to change my own usage.

Remember that my genes aren&#x27;t easy and i did a lot for it. (None of my family is actually slim). I did that 3 years ago at the end of college.<p>This is what helped for me (if you don&#x27;t agree, no problem, but it helped me a lot and there is so much research out there that it is difficult to get a decent perspective):<p>- Get your metabolism as high as possible, eat every 3-4 hours except when you are a sleep. In the evening, eat less carbs. Last (very light) meal = 2 hours before you go to sleep. The higher your metabolism, the more your body will become a energy burning machine.<p>- Losing weight = eating less then your daily requirement (intake of calories) or training more. Do this max. for 3 days in a row.. (so your body doesn&#x27;t realize you are losing weight -> remember people surviving without eating in a month? it&#x27;s a hormono called Leptine, it can severely destroy your metabolism :) )<p>- 60% is food, 40% is exercise (don&#x27;t eat to little, it will hurt your metabolism. I don&#x27;t advice a protein diet for too long.. Most people get much fatter afterwards because they destroyed their metabolism)<p>- Sleep enough (this is a hard one for me)<p>- No alcohol - it slows down your metabolism and contains empty calories.<p>- If you want to exercise as less as possible, here are some pointers:<p>- Running (= cardio), in the morning after a protein shake. Maximal effect + positive effect during the day, untill you go to sleep.<p>- Reduce sugar intake as much as possible (don&#x27;t worry about fructose and dextrose though)<p>- Adding muscle (this is harder for women), in the evening after eating. If you want to do cardio combined with this, do it after your weight exercises. Muscle needs 48 hours to recover, so that&#x27;s two days of extra fat burn.<p>One way of eating would be Paleo diet (popular with Crossfit). I call it : &quot;eating like a caveman&quot; and starting with it in 2 months.<p>PS. Changing the way you eat shouldn&#x27;t be a diet (=temporarily), you should be changing your lifestyle or eating routine.<p>PS 2. I seriously advice Tom Venuto - Burn The Fat, Feed the Muscle... If you want to know more about how your body works,i also liked the stuff Lyle McDonald wrote.. (but that&#x27;s more extreme)",1413281161

That was the case for Rust, for D, for Java and C# earlier, and of course C++ (who studies C with that intent). That was also not the case for Go, and that&#x27;s one reason why Go (by Pike&#x27;s own admission) failed to gain traction from C++ users.<p>Of course success is not guaranteed, but merely making a &quot;superior language&quot; is not a way to get C++ users off C++ (or any other language).",1413280958

You read words based on their outline rather than individual letters, what with the bits that stick upwards (ascenders) and downwards (descenders). Which is why ALL CAPS TEXT IS A LOT HARDER TO READ QUICKLY, and why if you jmuble some lettres in a few wrods you can still read them with relative ease.<p>So the way humans read text is still kind of image based - you match a word based on a preexisting idea of what they should look like. It&#x27;s just they&#x27;re coincidentally easy to read by computers, too.",1413280866

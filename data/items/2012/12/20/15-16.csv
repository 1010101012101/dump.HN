Things may seem extreme in this decade, but CALEA was passed in the early 90s, paramilitary police forces became common in the 1980s (with budgets that need not be approved by Congress every two years; in fact, some of these forces pay themselves with the proceeds from arrests, via a law passed by Congress), and the executive branch gained the power to declare drugs to be illegal without democratic process in the 1970s.  In the early 1960s, the Kennedy administration was sending soldiers to Vietnam without a declaration of war by Congress.<p>What happened in the early 2000s would not have been possible with the decades of build-up.  Without a standing army, without so much executive power, without such a vast and powerful law enforcement system, and without the already-established systems of domestic and global surveillance, it would have been much harder to see the provisions of the PATRIOT act or NDAA actually go through.<p>One of the few limits on government power that has any meaning in this day and age is the prohibition on granting titles of nobility.

Historically, the 10th amendment was considered a mere truism. U.S. v. Darby (1941).<p>Conceptually, how the Constitution works is as follows. The states inherited the sovereignty and unlimited power of the British parliament. In aggreeing to the Constitution, the states delegated some of that power to the federal government, and agreed to refrain from the exercise of certain other powers. The clauses of the Constitution outline the powers delegated and prohibited. All the 10th amendment says is that anything that hasn't been delegated or prohibited hasn't been delegated or prohibited. Which is tautological.<p>The mere face of the text cannot support an interpretation that the 10th amendment does anything other than state the obvious. If a federal action is otherwise Constitutional, by virtue of falling into one of the delegations, then it is by definition something that has not been reserved to the state.",1356017441

Maybe they want all their new visitors to try it out before buying? They could have the button change based on cookies, and they just started an ad campaign that's on HN's front page.<p>Edit: This comment was unhelpful? If not, why downvote?",1356015760

The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was an indirect example, but allocating the majority of blame to the banks is not appropriate. They acted rationally assuming perfect information (an assumption that's usually necessary in the economic models they used in evaluating creditworthiness), so if anything, they deserve criticism for failing to appreciate the significance of, and potential for, imperfect information. But that issue isn't really relevant here.<p>It might be a fundamental difference in our opinions, but I'm inclined to believe that the purpose of the law is to avoid situations requiring ""social justice."" These companies are playing by the rules, but it's the rules that are flawed. So I prefer to spend my time focused on the root cause of our outrage.",1356015687

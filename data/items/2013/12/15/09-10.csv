When I first moved to the bay area, I forced myself to go to a lot of meet ups and progressively learned how to appear fairly friendly and engage with people. I recommend doing that instead of reading up &quot;hacks&quot;- you&#x27;ll quickly pick up on what the most charismatic person in the room does to appear as such (or both, but those hacks lack a lot in subtlety- stuff like &quot;repeating the last 3 words&quot; sounds fake if you&#x27;re not genuinely interested).<p>It&#x27;s really a skill like learning a new programming language or playing the guitar- totally learnable with some efforts. I wish more socially challenged hackers realized that, cause it really helped me. (of course, my normal resting state is still highly introverted, but at least now i can fake it)",1387101372

That verse is from a 1965 book called &quot;Vedic Mathematics&quot; by Bharati Krishna Tirtha Maharaja[1].<p>The Quora blog you linked has issues with terminologies and timelines of this specific &quot;Vedic Mathematics&quot; book - such as calling these mental calculation techniques and tricks as <i>Vedic</i> even though there are no references to them in Vedas[2]. This is more of a political matter ;) And, it&#x27;s already pointed out in the article linked by OP[3]. I&#x27;m quoting it here:<p><i>It must be pointed out that these sutras given by Tirtha Maharaja are created by the author himself, as stated in the introduction to his book, &quot;Vedic Mathematics&quot; (published posthumously) and are therefore not actually Vedic.<p>These mathematical sutras are Vedic only in the sense that they are inspired by the Vedas in the mind of one dedicated to the Vedas.

He was 4-5 years early, and frankly 2002 prices weren&#x27;t that insane. Especially compared to 2006-2007 prices. He was really early, and if bet against housing at that point, he likely went bankrupt before the crash.<p>That&#x27;s really neither here nor there though. What&#x27;s the famous saying, something to the effect of &quot;economists have predicted 10 of the last 3 recessions&quot;. Somebody is always calling for a crash, and somebody is always calling for a bull market. After the fact you can always find someone who was right about it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they were right about the why, and it doesn&#x27;t mean they are going to be right about the next thing.",1382943591

Noticing that a bubble is developing, I would say, is the relatively easy part; predicting when it will collapse is the difficult part. As Keynes said, &quot;Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&quot;, so there is limited value in betting against bubbles.

I finally managed to switch off Rogers Cable in Southern Ontario but it took 5 phone calls, a forgotten disconnect, three offers of 15% off $132.99 as their &quot;best offer&quot; and a few callbacks, but I finally managed to switch to Start.ca for $94.99. With taxes, I&#x27;m saving $41 and getting the same speed, 150/10. (146/9.7 from speedtest.net but who&#x27;s counting...) The best part? Rogers would lie on speed tests, using &quot;SpeedBoost&quot; tech they keep to themselves (a recent change) which would lie to me and show 300/10 speeds -- but instead, when downloading, 18MB/s or 150mbps, would be all I see. The best part though? Copper cable is capable of gigabit speeds and the big companies are simply lying if they say otherwise. They&#x27;ve plans to get things to 2gbps in a couple years and could fast track that if Google, or regulation, really kicks things off. But can you imagine how much they&#x27;d charge for such speeds? Rogers already wants $225.99 for a simple symmetric 250mbps. AT&T U-Verse will soon offer 300mbps for $199. And like Rogers, probably a modem rental fee on top of that.

In the past, what one historian dubbed as the &quot;paranoid style of American politics&quot; has led to fear of and antipathy toward certain religions and social and political movements.</i><p>This is a stretch in my opinion. This article is thinly veiled legacy defending. Not admitting to any of the Warren Commission&#x27;s flaws just plays into the hands of the conspiracy theorists. Frankly there is a lot to be suspicious about. I&#x27;m not saying there is a conspiracy, but the Warren Commission deserves to be criticized.<p>For example:\nSeth Kantor&#x27;s testimony of encountering Ruby at Parkland hospital after JFKs assassination remains a baffling thread that the Warren Commission dismissed out of hand. Kantor had a very normal and somewhat productive journalistic career up until the assassination. During the Warren Commission he wasn&#x27;t even suggesting any ideas for what his encounter with Ruby might have meant, he just wanted it out there that it happened. Later he became a little conspiratorial (from what  I&#x27;ve heard), but who could blame him after watching the President get shot and running into the assassin&#x27;s killer soon thereafter (if he was telling the truth)?<p>If I had to be I&#x27;d say there is probably no conspiracy, but I think it&#x27;s very safe to say that the Warren Commission is not even close to the entire story.

A Github account with a dozen or so projects all related to a CMS is not what I call supporting open source. At best its a concession to the developers you&#x27;ve attracted to help with your political platform. You just won&#x27;t get certain developers if you don&#x27;t also allow them to participate in open source. It&#x27;s calculated and expedient here more than altruistic or in the name or transparency, openness and letting the American people own the works for hire they have paid for through taxes.<p>If he (or any politician) wants to really support the idea of open-source they would require that everything that can be open-sourced will be open-sourced. The only exception I see to open-sourcing would be limited to almost strictly to military or defense related software and hardware projects. For every single other system, the source code should be out there in the public. Start with every single non-critical piece of software that is not part of infrastructure like transportation and public utilities and once security practices and norms improve and stabilize among the non-critical stuff, slowly and carefully open source all the rest except for military and defense projects.<p>At the price tax payers are paying for software, we should own the code outright many many times over.",1382941078

6625466,comment,6623935,6624928,4,0,commanderkeen08,,,"Agreed. Facebook also treats the &quot;Friendship&quot; status as meaning, more or less, &quot;I&#x27;m really interested in what this person has to say about everything.&quot; And that&#x27;s not always the case. I&#x27;ve removed people simply because I was tired of seeing pictures of their kids on my News Feed or people arguing back and forth about marijuana legalization legislation. It doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t consider them to be my friend.<p>I know there&#x27;s a whole set of settings one can go through to limit the content you see from certain people, etc. etc. but that&#x27;s also another huge problem with Facebook in general. They take it upon themselves to decide for you which friends are more deserving of your attention. 90% of the time, it&#x27;s never right. I consider myself a pretty tech savy guy and even I couldn&#x27;t be bothered trying to understand how to do something like that. It&#x27;s easier, for a lot of people, to just remove someone from their daily news feed.<p>I used Social Fixer for this feature alone. I used it because the way I use Facebook (and everyone uses Facebook differently) is to keep in touch with old friends, the friends that moved, got married, graduated. I feel deceptively connected to these people even though I&#x27;m not because I have a way to sort of keep tabs without having to keep tabs on them. When they stop appearing in my news feed, they traverse into that vague friend/not-friend category and I&#x27;m left wondering what Tom has been up to all these years. Social Fixer usually would let me know that Tom has actually deleted his Facebook account and that&#x27;s why he has appeared to vanish from my digital life. Sometimes it told me that Jane has unfriended me and I was left assuming Jane got tired of all the gifs I was posting.",1382940642

6625453,comment,6622950,6625150,4,0,drewcrawford,,,"Well, this is as good of a time as any to dump my knowledge on the subject.<p>I love dot grids, because each page has the potential to be either grid, ruled, or plain, depending on how seriously you take the dots.  Having now gotten used to the various ways of using dotted paper, I don&#x27;t think I could go back.  If you are satisfied with other ruling methods, then you have many more potential vendors, but I am not.<p>So that leaves these contenders: leuchtturm1917, rhodia, behance, field notes, scout, dotgrid.co, whitelines, ecoqua, monsieur, and nuuna.  Vendors seem to come and go, as notebooks seem to be a bit of a fly-by-night sort of business.<p>Behance and nuuna have that &quot;fly by night&quot; feel and seem difficult to get ahold of in the US (e.g. through Amazon, etc), so I have not tried them.  Traditionally leuchtturm1917 has had this problem, but their US distributor seems to be straightening it out.<p>Scout and dotgrid.co only come in something like Moleskine&#x27;s &quot;cahier&quot; configuration (e.g., not hard bound).  These might be worth trying, but I prefer perfect-bound.<p>Field Notes only sells in &quot;cahier&quot; configuration, and their only dot grid product is on waterproof/fireproof/everythingproof paper.  I hear they work well with pencil or ballpoint pen but the ink from my trusty G2s doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the paper, so I will just be getting ink all over the place.<p>Ecoqua sells a glue-bound notebook with a soft cover and no pocket, so it isn&#x27;t really Moleskine-equivalent in its featureset.<p>Whitelines is interesting because the lines/ruling is actually brighter than the paper itself, which scans well.  However, their Black Ocean notebook is missing a pocket in the back cover, which is an important feature for me.  I will probably pick one up eventually.  They do have some nice pads though, including offbeat paper like isometric.<p>Monsieur is a weird size (not very pocket-friendly), and seems to have some supply issues.<p>This leaves the Leuchtturm1917 and the Rhodia.  In my experience, the Leuchtturm1917 is smeary with G2 pens, but is otherwise perfect.  The Rhodia&#x27;s paper is perfect for the G2, but because the paperstock is so thick, the notebook feels a little thick in the pocket.  I tend to alternate between these two notebooks.<p>I have also looked into abusing the on-demand book publishers to create notebooks, but it seems self-published hardbound pocket books are not a thing.  Things like boundforanything.com get pretty close, but you&#x27;re still missing core features like a ribbon, elastic, and a rear pocket.<p>tl;dr getting a notebook right is more difficult than it looks, rhodia and leuchtturm1917 come the closest for me.",1382940303

I haven&#x27;t seen data suggesting that radiation treatment in adults increase the risks of cancer, and by the way radiation is now extensively used in many diagnostic tools and it is generally accepted that low dose of radiations are harmless or even beneficial (while the media keeps screaming that any level of radiation causes cancer, which is nonsensical).",1382940128

265399,comment,265334,265395,0,0,qwph,,,"There's a tiny kernel of truth to the line-counting argument - if you find yourself repeatedly typing the same patterns of code over and over again, and there's no way to refactor it so that the pattern's expressed only once, then yes, then you're probably using a language with weak abstraction capabilities.<p>But yeah, trying to arrange all languages along a single ""axis of power"" is a pretty pointless exercise...",1217738972

265392,comment,258737,258883,0,0,netcan,,,"I don't think that's worrying. If Amazon or Facebook or any other site did it wouldn't even be noticed. I think that's just reaching for a way to fault Google.<p>BTW, an interesting application of personalisation is not so much search ads (They are already pretty much the most targeted ads because search term is enough to target ads with) but content ads (eg adsense). Currently, ads are  targeted using relevance to page content/site content or demographics of the users. But search history reveals a lot about interests & could be the key to 'fixing' context advertising (from the advertisers perspective).",1217737123

265389,comment,265117,265369,0,0,brett,,,"1. Yes. cname.theirsite.com resolves to myserver.com.mysite.com which in turn resolves to an IP address. Browsers will send requests to your server at that IP along with cname.theirsite.com in ""Host"" header.<p>2. I'm not totally sure. I would start with wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</a><p>Users will likely ask for help, so you'll probably want to familiarize yourself with the UIs for major DNS providers, especially GoDaddy.<p>Another gotcha is that CNAMEs can be a little funky for root domains. So something.com will be harder (or impossible) for people to CNAME than foo.something.com depending on their provider. I've been told that CNAMEing the root domain means that all records (like MX) get automatically aliased as well, but I haven't found that to be uniformly true. My guess is that it depends on the DNS software.",1217736685
265388,comment,265308,265308,0,0,makecheck,,,"This article is somewhat misleading, in that of the 15 things listed, only the bottom three are identified as unique to free software.<p>Indeed, some of <i>the</i> most disgustingly unusable stuff I have ever seen has come from companies, not only Microsoft but ""enterprise"" people, groups that should have a vested interest in software quality.<p>A problem I didn't see listed, is that the people <i>acquiring</i> software may not care.  Many of them absolutely don't.  I've been in organizations where the people in charge of getting stuff don't have a clue what ""features"" or misfeatures are actually impacting the usability of the people they are supposed to serve.  They don't ask, they don't factor it into the buy/download decision, and no one seems to trace the resulting productivity problems back to them.",1217736665

265385,comment,258737,259048,0,0,netcan,,,"Not exactly the same thing. Spoofing you comp's trade name is pretty much the definition of trademark violation.<p>It (Google's policy) flops around a bit. It differs between countries and seems to get tweaked or turned over every so often. \nI believe in the US bidding restrictions on trademarked terms were recently removed. But you are still restricted in using trademarked terms in ads.<p>Personally, I agree that restrictions (bidding on trademarked terms) should be removed. I would compare it to handing out flyers on the street outside you competitions' shop. Tasteless maybe, but shouldn't be illegal. Companies don't own the search results, trademark or not any more then they own the street.",1217736361

If pg is listening, there IS a market for this book and a new printing, even if only a limited run, would be very much appreciated.",1217736164

If there is one interesting thing about our current form of democracy it is that people routinely vote on a few narrow issues and get a whole pile of non-related items pushed at them going directly against the interests of that same majority.<p>Sometimes you have to do more than just sit on the wrong chair for a while to make a noticeable difference. Lots of people have been doing the equivalent of that for a long time now without much progress being made. I guess for Aaron that speed of progress just wasn't enough.<p>And just like Al Capone he wasn't charged with spreading the knowledge, he was charged with the computer crime equivalent of tax evasion, the breaking of some terms of service and evading some very basic bans on an otherwise terribly insecure network where <i>everybody</i> had access to that knowledge.<p>The internet doesn't care about censorship it is said, it will route around it. But someone will still have to program those routers and that where people like Aaron come in, they observe and identify bottle-necks, then proceed to fix them. If your gravy train ride depends on holding bits hostage and dribbling them out to the public at a rate or in a way that you can control then you really should go and read Nick Negroponte's 'being digital' again.<p>It's been said that I don't like JSTOR.

You either lookst it from a fixed ""be good"" mindset or a growth ""get better"" mindset.<p>With a be-good mindset, you will be less persistent because failing means you're not so good.<p>With a get-better mindset, failing won't matter as much, if not at all. This is because, in your minds eye, you're focused on improvement, so even if you fail you feel you will learn something (99 ways to not make a lightbulb).<p>With a get-better mindset, fear of rejection and failure are extinguished.<p>It also ties in with what the OP is doing because he is focused on learning when building and shipping products. If his sole intention was to ship and not actually learn anything from it but rather as a demo of his skills, would he ship as much?",1358413475

How would such a patent be valued?<p>If the transferred assets are taxed, that would introduce at least a modest loss for using a shell.  Also, I would think that the valuation for tax purposes should be something like the value to be claimed in court, at least if the transfer occurs soon before a round of trolling. I can imagine a troll reassigning a patent to a shell, low-balling the value for tax purposes, and then inflating it when wielding the patent in court.

I feel more productive when working by myself, but I know that personal perceptions of productivity can be false. Measuring personal vs team/company productivity becomes hard in anything less than the short term)<p>* That co-location is always the best solution (it isn't - other factors like team location and skills come into play)<p>What I am saying is that there is a lot of research showing that co-located teams in team-room like settings are much more productive. This runs counter to many developers preferences (mine too ;-) so it tends to get ignored.<p>So much more productive that solutions like 'Let's fly everybody to the same place and pay their room and board for a month' can be cost effective.<p>Here are some references to the research (If anybody has any research that contradicts this I'd love to hear about it. Especially if it talks about actual measured metrics of productivity - rather that self-reported 'I felt just as productive at home' ones.)<p>----<p>""It doesn't take much distance before a team feels the negative effects of distribution - the effectiveness of collaboration degrades rapidly with physical distance. People located closer in a building are more likely to collaborate (Kraut, Egido & Galegher 1990). Even at short distances, 3 feet vs. 20 feet, there is an effect (Sensenig & Reed 1972). A distance of 100 feet may be no better than several miles (Allen 1977). A field study of radically collocated software development teams,[...], showed significantly higher productivity and satisfaction than industry benchmarks and past projects within the firm (Teasley et al., 2002). Another field study compared interruptions in paired, radically-collocated and traditional, cube-dwelling software development teams, and found that in the former interruptions were greater in number but shorter in duration and more on-task (Chong and Siino 2006).

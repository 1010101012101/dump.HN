4536778,comment,4536552,4536552,17,0,curt,,,"Please know that in periods of ""high personal tax rates"" business owners declared their income through their companies thereby lowering their tax rates. You would have a company car, company vacation, company dinners, you can even make it company policy to pay for the employees children college education, etc... This is the same reason any comparison of income equality over time is meaningless. Since income was declared through different avenues.<p>To understand the tax implications of economic growth you have to look at the tax payments as a percentage of GDP as well as compliance costs. In the US tax payments have held steady at about 18% of GDP since WWII until recently. People hunt for loopholes no matter what. But when rates are low you don't have to look for loopholes, so you can deploy your capital more efficiently. Thus generating economic growth. This is why tax cuts often stimulate large economic booms. Capital that was sitting in say tax-protected muni bonds will move into the market and be deployed for business expansion and thereby hiring.<p>There's so much evidence to the contrary of this article, even Obama's own counsel of economic advisories share the view that tax cuts stimulate economic growth. Christina Romer, his former advisor wrote a paper on the subject. What they do is look at country around the world to collect more data points for a better regression analysis.<p>Also note that when you say ""tax cuts"", not all tax cuts are made equal. For a tax cut to be effective it needs to change  long-term behavior. So credits and such have a near zero or negative effect while rate cuts have a positive effect. The most beneficial being capital gain rate cuts (ie every time they have been cut, revenues from the tax have increased), corporate, and then final income tax rate cuts.<p>-Really going to down vote me without refuting any of what I said.",1347951580

You are an unpublished internet stranger and the Alcubierre drive has been scrutinized by some of the top minds in physics. But your criticisms are more important for some reason I don't know. Mkay, going to bed now.<p>Edit:\nBy the way.  I did read the thing about point A and B and understand it completely.  The thing is, it doesn't matter.  This is why I'm absolutely sure now that you haven't got a clue as to what the drive actually does.  Here let me explain it to you like you are 5.  If you send a packet of information from point A to point B, and it goes faster than light, then yes that will screw with causality.  But if instead you bring point A closer to point B, it will appear as though it is ""traveling"" (notice the quotes) faster than light.  It is however not traveling. it isn't moving. No movement through space.  Freefall. zero movement.  Stillness. Think about that for a moment.  Absolutely positively no movement.  Complete stillness.  There is a lack of motion with this drive relative to the speed of light.  Mind you this isn't a wormhole because even wormholes can screw with causality.  This is a space creator/destoyer.  Destroys in the front, creates in the back.  No movement is involved.  I know it's really hard to wrap your head around but just think about it for a couple of days.  think about bringing point A closer to point B instead of going through all the trouble of sending the information.

He basically pointed out that in InnoDB, the table is contained in the primary key index, while in PostgreSQL, it is an indexed heap of pages.  Moreover InnoDB does not support traversing the table in physical order, so sequential scans of a large table are ghastly performance-wise.<p>What this means is that optimizations appropriate for InnoDB (index everything you search on) are very poor for PostgreSQL and vice versa. In PostgreSQL you index only a few columns, typically join conditions and a few select search columns, and the combination of the operating system and database will do the rest.  In short, InnoDB <i>only does index scans</i> (and the table is a special index).  This makes some things perform better (primary key lookups), but many other things perform worse.  Moreover optimizing for one does not mean optimizing for the other....",1347950980

From what I can tell, he's a lawyer more versed in dealing with much larger companies and venture capital transactions as opposed to the typical start-up (if such a thing exists).<p>Particularly in the field of web (contrasted with physical products/live events for example), the need to consider compliance is reduced. If you are providing a good service to users, it is unlikely you will run into issues in terms of consumer complaints.<p>I would caveat it by suggesting that intellectual property is  (obviously) an important area to consider. However, there are online tools for patent searching which will be able to give you an idea of whether your product could be patentable (no patent search even done by a lawyer or patent attorney would be exhaustive in any event).<p>As to brand protection, trade mark registration in the territory where you are based will be relatively cheap and will give you a degree of leverage if someone else starts up a similarly named service. Although it must be said that the main reason people will copy a name is to piggyback on goodwill which will not be a relevant consideration for most start-ups.<p>Many actual start-up lawyers will be willing to give a few hours of their time for free or at least should be, to talk with you about your business and highlight any initial concerns and make recommendations to help your business.<p>If they do provide recommendations, I suggest that if they haven't done already you request a fixed rate for any one particular piece of work. If they can't provide a fixed rate, I suggest you look elsewhere. There are sufficient good lawyers out there to enable you to find one who will be willing to be more flexible on fees than rigidly sticking to an hourly rate.<p>In terms of tax, I would suggest the above but in relation to an accountant, the basics of corporate taxation are relatively simple  and you should be able to find an accountant willing to give you time for free.<p>On a side note, although it is easy to bash lawyers' fees, if you are a large corporate operating in an area where legal compliance is crucial, an hourly rate of $1000 per hour is a drop in the ocean if it saves you many multiples of that in avoiding costs. Blame shifting in ensuring you have someone that you can sue if they make a mistake can be priceless.

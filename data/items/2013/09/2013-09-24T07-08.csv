Only in the recent years there has been any competition if you want a GPU with good 3d features. Intel has had decent 3d only in their latest few generations of integrated GPUs and ATI drivers have ranged from not working at all to barely usable.<p>That being said, this is a very welcome change and will hopefully make the nouveau drivers better in the long run. In particular, this is good news for the common linux graphics architecture (dri/drm, etc) and Wayland.",1380009572

6436594,comment,6434400,6436323,5,0,icambron,,,"Tackling that out of order, because it seems clearer.<p>> Analogize with entering vs. breaking and entering.<p>From Free Dictionary [1]:<p><pre><code>    breaking and entering v., n. entering a residence or other enclosed property through the slightest amount of force (**even pushing open a door**), without authorization.
</code></pre>
Emphasis mine. If pushing a door counts, so does changing the user agent header or auto-incrementing IDs. The key here is &quot;without authorization&quot;. As that analogizes with the Weev situation and our librarian, much of the debate I see here on HN seems to hinge on whether that means authorization in some technical sense or in the sense meant by that breaking and entering definition. I submit that it means the latter, in part because that reflects how we see authorization in other contexts (like doors we&#x27;re not supposed to enter) and in part because I don&#x27;t think the first view holds up to scrutiny on its own terms.<p>Let me explain what I mean by that. Consider two situations:<p>1. A server responds to requests for email addresses without checking whether the user is authorized to receive that information.<p>2. A server responds to all requests without checking whether they contain injected SQL.<p>In pure technology terms, these aren&#x27;t really any different. In either case, the server is simply failing to check that the request has certain properties (came from the right user/does not contain context escapes). But of course case 2 is particularly nefarious, because passing SQL directly to the database is clearly not the <i>intent</i> of that interface, and that it&#x27;s not the intent is obvious to the SQL injector. So the intent of the software is what matters. But then it&#x27;s what matters in case 1 too. The lack of technical enforcement of this intent is not the issue.<p>Which leads me to some clarity about this:<p>> Not if you make a distinction between using a service and breaking a service.<p>I believe this use/break distinction exists, but the distinction isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s determined by the code or the vaguer &quot;design of the code&quot;; it&#x27;s determined by the <i>purpose of the service</i>. The service as it would be described functionally, not technically. The service was not meant to be used by Weev and his scraper any more than our librarian&#x27;s database was meant to be used by SQL injection, or any more than your unencrypted traffic was meant to be intercepted by my packet sniffer (you did nothing to not authorize me to see it!). To drive that home, the library&#x27;s hapless database admin who foolishly decides to update the list of books using her own SQL injection bug is <i>not</i> hacking, because she <i>is</i> authorized to fiddle with the database, even though, in your terms, it&#x27;s bypassing the design of the code.<p>In other words, authorization is not the same as the technical artifacts involved in authorization. More generally, I don&#x27;t think being bad at making software justifies people accessing it when they know it&#x27;s not meant for them.<p>As the law is actually applied here, I am somewhat sympathetic to Weev, on the grounds that I don&#x27;t think it was a serious crime (imagine if it were bank account information!), but that&#x27;s a quantitative issue, not a qualitative one. I can also see that there are many cases where it isn&#x27;t obvious whether something is meant for you to access or not (like a door that seems to lead into a public place but which turns out to be a private space), and I can imagine there being issues there. But this isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/breaking+and+entering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/breaking+and+e...</a>",1380009025

Other reports[1] from the SCMP indicate the government may want to make the entire Pudong district a free trade zone if things develop smoothly.<p>Pudong is home to most of Shanghai&#x27;s finance industry. The FTZ however is centered on the Yangshan Deep Water Port. (Map of the FTZ [2], yellow neighborhoods) The loosening of Internet restrictions around a <i>port</i> gives credibility to the idea that Pudong in general will see more developments like this to come. This is significant because those initiating the plans to expand the FTZ in Shanghai have faced the strongest <i>resistance</i> from China&#x27;s finance and banking regulators[3]. Most banks in China can not engage in international commerce directly so outside investments usually entail setting up a complex JV with a China based company with terms that strongly favor the embedded players.<p>What&#x27;s interesting to see here is the government is using the opening up of Internet restrictions as a carrot in part of a larger play to promote economic growth while the opposition is coming from the entrenched players in an industry which otherwise stands to make huge gains by introducing more competition.

OpenID using for example a Yubikey is a good example.<p>The good thing with biometrics is that the user always carry the info needed with him/her. There are a few drawbacks though:<p>(1) The information is not very stable. It changes during the lifetime of the user. Sometimes it can be pretty rapid.<p>(2) The information is not very unique. Some types of biometrics is better than others. There is also differences in informational quality between individuals and ethnic groups. Depending on type of biometrics we get anything from a few bits to a few ten of bits. This means that it is not better than a good password that is 8 characters or more, but as good as or a bit better than a normal PIN code.<p>(3) The information is not under the users control and can&#x27;t readily be replace. <i>This</i> is one thing many here and elsewhere seem to have missed in the CCC announcement. The point is that you as a user can&#x27;t decide at any given time that you don&#x27;t trust you token anymore, invalidate it and get a new token. That is why biometrics is foremost a tool _for others_ to identify you (passports, forensics).<p>The reason fingerprint based biometrics is so popular (compared to other types of biometrics) is that it is possible to build compact, cheap sensors that are pretty easy to use and are simple to integrate into digital systems.<p>All types of biometrics are fuzzy. We normally talk about False Acceptance Rate (FAR), that is how often do we accept a biometric ID as valid when in fact it is not. And correspondingly we have False Rejection Rate, where a valid ID is rejected. Good biometric systems have FAR, FRR under 10%. But for a busy airport there is still quite a few mistakes during a day.<p>The way a fingerprint based biometric system normally works is that you have a sensor that creates an image (256 levels of gray scale or similarly). The image is then processed (differential filters etc) followed by feature extraction. The features are called minuae:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutiae"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutiae</a><p>Typically sworls, where lines end, merges splits. Normally we find 8-10-15 or a few more good minutae in the image. Based on the location of the minutae we create a graph.<p>The graph is then stored (if registering a user - called enrollment) or compared to stored graphs. And here comes the fuzziness. The graph will not be similar so we simply can&#x27;t do a SHA-1 digest and match. The graph will be rotated, scaled, stretched, have fewer or more points. Basically fuzzy congruence matching with threshold.<p>The feature extraction can be done directly in the sensor. But in the case of TouchID I don&#x27;t think so. Apple bought Authentec and their area sensors (that can capture a whole image directly. Sweep sensors detect movement of a finger over the sensor, estimate speed and stitch image slices together) simply delivered a raw image. This means that the filtering, feature extraction and matching is done inside A7.<p>Apple has touted the security of the processing. Basically it is ARM Trust Zone used in several other devices.<p><a href=""http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzon...</a><p>TZ is good, but there has been attacks published. And there is nothing that says that Apple has not added a read port from the untrusted enclave into the memory of the trusted enclave. For efficient debug reasons for example.<p>So. Biometrics is fuzzy and will give false acceptance (as the main problem. rejextion is less of a problem). There is quite probably an image available in the A7 and we really don&#x27;t know if it and/or the graph database is in fact accessible.<p>When it comes to the CCC attack - we simply don&#x27;t know if they tried lower resolution before ending up with 2400 dpi. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it works (at least sometimes - fuzziness again) with lower resolution. Also attack always gets better. I&#x27;m prepared to bet a good IPA that someone within 2 years will show how he/she can unlock a 5S just by smartly pressing on the home button while breathing to activate residue as fingerprint. It has been done with area sensors such as Authentecs before.<p>TouchID is good if it makes users without PIN to use it. But if it gets users with PINs stop using PINs, it is not as good. What would be great if we could combine TouchID with PIN or password. All the time.<p>I hope all this explains a few things. And remember, once again, the main problem with biometrics is that it can&#x27;t be changed at will by the user. Good for others, less so for the user.",1380007363

We can&#x27;t simply rely on improving the chances of getting better people into office for at least two reasons: a lot of damage can be done in four years, and even then, most of the electoral branch isn&#x27;t elected by The People and at least some of it is allowed to carry influence from one president to the next.<p>I believe the most effective way to solve this problem will be to approach it from many angles with the ultimate purpose of restoring accountability to the executive branch.

My point is that even if the price crashes because of some bad news in China, it still has a chance to rise again when Wall Street comes (if we are to believe that those companies still want to enter).<p>It really looks like speculation is what keeps the btc/usd pair rising, but with such good news coming, I can&#x27;t think of a lot of reasons why people would stop speculating.

7045249,comment,7045044,7045044,7,0,bruce511,,,"I think maybe the whole concept here is based on a false premise, and the solution being offered, even if the premise was true, is a bad one.<p>First the premise; &quot;software only needs to be paid for once&quot; -in most cases I&#x27;d argue it is. A closed-source package for example (say, like, Windows) is a simple one-time purchase. Lots of people may be paying, and yes this company making it makes a profit, but the cost to 1 user is only a tiny fraction of the cost that it cost to make. Of course most closed-source software doesn&#x27;t make money at all, never mind the scale of money windows makes, so Windows is an outlier here in terms of profit vs cost.<p>Indeed most companies probably end up making a loss, and going out of business. Maybe that means the model is broken, or maybe it&#x27;s just inevitable that most of the software being created, closed or open, is pretty much crap.<p>Now to the proposed solution. Which can be summarized as &quot;design by committee&quot; - ill put in x$ if you complete feature y which I want. With the community dictating how much they&#x27;ll spend and on what, I don&#x27;t think an elegant well-thought-out beautiful product will be the result. Designing a whole system is often best done by the person who has the Vision of where the project is going, even if it takes 10 years to get there.<p>Yes, developers need to eat. Which is why the big open-source projects are funded in some way (like Mozilla is funded by google.) the little projects tend to get no funding of any kind. And even big projects (like say jquery) get by mostly on donated programmer time, not cash of their own.<p>I appreciate that many developers are between a rock and a hard place. They want to write whatever they like, and not have to work for some employer, but at the same time they want to get paid. But freedom comes at a price. And &quot;doing whatever you like&quot; is seldom paid for. And indeed the proposed model here is suggesting that a bunch of people will become your boss, and tell you what to do. Which I guess means you might as well just go off and get a job instead.",1389504116

This proposal has some merit for hardening software against trojan and malware attacks, but realistically, the majority of people are running Firefox on top of Windows and OSX, and if governments want to plant surveillance, we know it&#x27;s trivially easy to do so, especially on Windows.<p>Looking at the Snowden revelations, the NSA was attacking the client and server, but the server side a lot more. PRISM and MUSCULAR, plus intercepting people&#x27;s actual hardware deliveries and implanting backdoors before FedEx even places the computer on your doorstep.<p>On top of all that, is actual browser security of the runtime.

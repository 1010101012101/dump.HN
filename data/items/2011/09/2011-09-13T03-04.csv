Many, if not most, fields of science are built in areas where it's hard to run a true physical simulation of the model. For example, take machine learning, where nearly every method is developed without novel collection of new data, but is run entirely on data that has previously been collected and been analyzed over and over again.<p>If you run simulations, you should already know ways to test them without collecting new raw data, particularly if you have a large corpus of data from the real system.<p>What's your true reason?

The article is blaming people for counting on social security and other government handouts instead of saving up and paying for it themselves.<p>The solution to this, of course, is MORE government handouts, more taxes on those who did manage to get a bit of money together. In general boiling down to massively punishing those who did do what the article describes as the ideal.<p>In most socialist parties in Europe this is actually a known tactic : make people screw up their lives, give them crumbs so they live miserable lives but don't have enough incentive to fix things (sometimes people like this die in their home, and it isn't noticed for 2 months. Then everybody's shocked how ""society abandoned"" these people, when of course it's the exact reverse). Then socialists blame society for ""forcing people into unemployment"".<p>Massive numbers of people will choose the easy option, no matter how horrible the life it gives. And of course, accepting responsability for your own life is ... not the easy option.<p>So it must be closed off, or you best be prepared for disaster.<p>London was but a warning, like the car burnings of Paris were before. And you can make the mistake of assuming these riots, and car burnings are over, but that's a mistake. What really happens is that there is a constant low-level rioting that's been going on for a decade now. What ""set off"" the big riot was simply a screwup on the hands of the police. Maybe someone got transferred and their replacement neglected to deploy the police the first night ... whatever. And the people who are on the street every night got their chance, the message spread, and a few thousand people joined the riots, because the first 10 got through the security. Car burnings are a constant menace for 13 years in most French cities, but usually people get caught after 1-5 cars. So most nights, we're talking 5 car burnings over all of France. What happened during the ""riots"" is simple : some guy burns 10 cars without police intervention, calls his friends.<p>Of course, the solution to this is to force the taxpayer to provide the infrastructure for these groups to become million-members groups, instead of a few thousand member groups like they are today.

2989844,comment,2989087,2989581,4,0,SwellJoe,,,"""- Better GUI integration""<p>I don't know what this means. GUI integration with what?<p>""- Standardized and complete API going beyond simple libc and POSIX (which are quite long in the tooth now)""<p>Gnome provides a quite impressive and modern GUI API, and so does KDE. SQLite has a great database API. MySQL has a great database API. OpenGL is a great 3D API (admittedly lagging behind DirectX, since few games target OpenGL to push it forward). SDL is a solid media API. There are great APIs for big math, low-level system constructs (Boost, for instance), disk and data, media of many types, etc. There's a library for <i>everything</i> in a Linux system, probably three or four of them. Just because they are not from one vendor does not mean they don't exist, or that they aren't good.<p>To insist that Linux and Open Source operating systems play by the same rules as Microsoft is to stack the deck in favor of Microsoft and Windows. Luckily, Open Source can opt out of that system, and build awesome things without needing a central commander to determine what is and isn't available. Saying that libc and POSIX are the only standardized APIs on Linux is like limiting yourself to only using applications from Microsoft; thus removing nearly all of the reasons to choose Windows. I have conceded that Windows has vastly superior application support...unless you're willing to say that Windows only has a couple dozen applications, because no others come from Microsoft, you can't ask me to give Windows the nod on libraries because they don't all have a POSIX or standards body approval on them (Microsoft doesn't get outside standards approval for most of their APIs either, while we're on the subject). A modern Linux system has vastly broader and deeper API and library support in almost every area. You may <i>prefer</i> Windows APIs, which is fine, but a lot of folks prefer the Linux options, and there's definitely a lot more variety in the Linux world.<p>Linux also has <i>way</i> more awesome and plentiful mobile APIs than Windows. Windows isn't even a contender in this space.<p>""- Access control lists""<p>Nope.<p>""- Nicer driver system and better driver support""<p>I disagree with the ""nicer driver system"" assertion, but even when we just take it to mean ""better support for the most modern hardware"", ReactOS doesn't replicate it, anyway. Driver support in ReactOS is vastly worse than driver support in any modern Linux distribution, which is mentioned in the article, where it discusses running ReactOS on virtual hardware, and the problems that come when running it on real hardware. ReactOS is also currently trying to replicate Windows XP. Drivers are no longer coming out for XP for the most modern gear, and new drivers don't work with XP, so even when they reach perfection in ReactOS and it can load all XP drivers flawlessly, they will still have much worse driver support than Linux.<p>I'll also mention that I lately have more problems with drivers on Windows than I do on Linux. I have a handful of older USB and Firewire devices that simply won't work with the latest version of Windows because the manufacturer isn't making new drivers, but continue to work fine on modern Linux versions. From my current perspective, Linux has much better hardware driver support...though if I were buying new hardware, I might have to check the web to be sure there's a decent driver for the hardware I want to buy.<p>But, this is all just a bunch of random Windows/Linux fanboy ranting about random ancillary stuff.<p>UNIX is a superior design <i>at its core</i>. The simple beauty of it is a thing of wonder. Windows, and its creaking DOS underpinnings (C:\\, really? we still have C:\\?), is a horrorshow by contrast. I made my assertion above based on the belief that anyone who understands both systems couldn't possibly come to the conclusion that Windows is the better OS. It may have more and better applications (it definitely does). It may have more and better drivers (debatable at this point). It may even have a few features that are better than the Linux equivalent (definitely, and the reverse is also true).<p>But, the Windows OS...the soul of the thing, particularly from the perspective of a software developer, is so obviously inferior to Linux or UNIX that I have a hard time even comprehending an argument to the contrary. This is a limitation on my part, I guess. I just can't comprehend a mind that thinks so differently from my own.",1315885277

Obviously I don't work at Microsoft and can't just fire up a debugger attached to the VS source to track down an issue. I find it bemusing that ""you can't reproduce the issue or track it down"", turns into, ""well, it would be hard to debug without the source"". (No joke.) From where I'm sitting, that tends toward ""blame the bug on the user"" bait.<p>No, what I meant is that you CAN catch the exception and probably get a stack trace, Microsoft, for reasons that are beyond me, generally has stripped symbols on their public PDB servers, so when customers send me stacks even with symbols resolved they say meaningless things like msenv.dll!SomeFunction + 0x392818 bytes, which is obviously silly.  And THAT is the reason it is hard for external people to actually figure out the underlying issue or a good work-around. If the exception is coming from within VS code then you don't have much info on the stack. A lot of times it is coming from a third party dll (I group MS out of band releases here as they use the same extensibility APIs that third parties do for the most part), and having those symbols is also unlikely as lots of companies don't even have symbol servers, so resolving those stack frames can be a no-go as well. Some of this is unique to Microsoft, though I would have the same problem debugging Google or Apple code if I didn't have proper PDBs or source access, so I don't know if this is solely the fault of Microsoft, though their public symbols being stripped is stupid (don't get me started on how I can't even GET internal access to Office PDBs without a 'business need'...)<p>>As for the last two paragraphs, I'll merely hope that it wasn't a veiled attempt to call me a troll,<p>Nope, that is why I explicitly said 'not saying you are one', I was explaining my views on why the community can at times be dismissive or appear rude. They generally run into lots of people that come, demand answers, are generally rude all around and then leave without ever saying thanks...it is a thankless job to man support forums, and it can burn people out :)<p>I have had some (albeit more limited) experience with a couple of open source communities and never felt a much different vibe, I just assumed it was 'part of the customer service' kind of arena, you generally deal with the pissed off and perhaps pissy customers, which can be hard, and often times unless they have a simple question you can answer immediately they lose interest in the whole undertaking, accuse you of lying if you say you can't repro it, etc...<p>>I merely wish that the support forums were better, and that there were community lead resources for Microsoft products.<p>Me too, that is why I try to help out at the forums for the product I work on. Unfortunately I don't agree with all of Microsoft's support approaches, but no company is perfect, at least not one I have found. I think the lack of a two-way community has to do with Microsoft being a for-profit entity. People feel that if they have problems Microsoft better damn well fix it now, and they don't have interest in helping others out, that's Microsoft's job.  There is some decent community on StackOverflow around MS technology, much better than MSDN Forums, but even that can be hit or miss and generally the best answers end up coming from Microsoft employees, most of whom are helping out in their free time as most of them are definitely NOT paid support people, so they can't really spend their work day answering questions, at least not too much of it if they want to make all their commitments happen.<p>>I hope this clarifies. I'm simply genuinely curious as to the fundamental nature of how the global community of .NET developers differs from that of python/go/c++/ruby/etc.<p>Yep, as I alluded to above my own personal feelings have to do with Microsoft's history (most of the people involved in the most egregious things are gone or at least 'reformed' enough I doubt they would be so 'bold' as they were back then), the fact it is a for profit company and the fact that it seems harder (for whatever reason) to get people in the community with a lot of knowledge (there are a lot of folks not at Microsoft that probably know part of my product better than I do) to 'give back'.<p>It is a hard problem, there are people that do nothing but work on community engagement, they closely monitor/gather data on this and try to do outreach, tweak things to be better, etc... but I don't think anyone has found the silver bullet yet.",1315883868

2989789,comment,2989676,2989676,19,0,hugh3,,,"This thread is relevant to my interests.<p>On the subject of the ""diamond"" planet, I'm actually surprised to see the lead author of the paper in question referring to it as a ""diamond planet"". I thought that was just a media label. I read the paper when it came out, and all that was indicated was that an extremely large (Jupiter-mass) extremely dense (much smaller than Jupiter) body was detected orbiting a pulsar. The density was consistent with something reasonably close to diamond, but I would have thought that there always has to be <i>some</i> other elements in there... and in any case I wasn't convinced that the vast majority of the interior would be cool enough to be crystalline rather than liquid carbon. So while I'm very confident that there's <i>some</i> extremely massive, extremely dense planet orbiting that star, I'm yet to be one hundred percent convinced that ""diamond"" is the correct label for it.<p>Which brings me neatly to the <i>actual</i> point of the article, on climate change. I'm somewhat out of my field here, but no more than the author is. The reason I'm skeptical about the hypothesis ""burning fossil fuels is likely to cause significant and disastrous climate change in the future"" is that it's all based on simulations which can't be tested against experiment. And I <i>do</i> simulations for a living, so I know enough about them to be very skeptical whenever confronted with simulations in the absence of experiment. Maybe it's true, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were, but I'm certainly not willing to talk about it as if it's as strongly supported as... well, the vast majority of other stuff that we mean when we talk about 'science'.<p>The strength of a scientific theory is (and I'm still working on figuring out exactly how to phrase this) determined by the question of ""If this turned out to be false, how much experimental data would suddenly be very difficult to explain?"" If evolution were false, then pretty much <i>all</i> of biology is suddenly very difficult to explain. If the hypothesis ""big dense planet thing orbiting PSR J1719−1438"" turns out to be false, then there's a bunch of measurements which are very hard to explain. On the other hand if the hypothesis ""<i>diamond</i> planet orbiting PSR J1719−1438"" is false then it's not at all difficult to explain. And if the hypothesis of significant anthropogenic climate change turns out to be false, then this makes very little difference to our ability to explain existing experimental data.",1315883651

I suspect that if someone could have sold the church on a way to 'fix' difference between what science was telling them, and what they wanted to be true, they would have wasted millions doing that too.<p>Galileo knew that no matter how hard they wished it, the planets would not suddenly stop in its orbit and the universe begin to rotate around it. No more than any amount of wishing, better behaviors, and offerings of gold could stop the seasons (or the climate for that matter) from changing.<p>Not sure we've learned all that much about mixing science and policy since Galileo's time.",1315882800

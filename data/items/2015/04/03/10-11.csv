They&#x27;re just not the kind of thing everybody wants or needs. And I&#x27;m not sure tablet makers ever really thought that.<p>Using the term &#x27;languish&#x27; just seems a  bit too negative to describe this particular outcome. Tablets are finding (or found) their market, and are doing okay. Smartwatches will probably be a similar kind of thing. Setting the bar for &#x27;success&#x27; at smartphone levels seems a bit too high to me.",1428058726

They show how important a nationalistic point of view is (as in &quot;Greece first&quot;).<p>For 70 years no German Government could win on a nationalistic ticket. The vast majority of German elites were pro-Europe. The majority of people saw the billions of $ wealth transfer to the southern and eastern countries as moral compensation for the war.<p>With comparing the elected German chancellor to Hitler, comparing the finance minister to a concentration camp manager and the talk of reparations, Germans felt insulted and black mailed and Greece created cracks in the above narrative.<p>The Greek government achieved that the next German government and generation of conservatives will win on a nationalistic ticket to fend of right wing anti European parties like the AfD (Alternative For Germany). Which is good, as the best for Germany is not a political union like the EU but TTIP and something like NAFTA combined with a China style currency policy. The EU helps small countries gain disproportional power and poor countries gain money transfers while it binds and hinders Germany and France. The US does what&#x27;s best for the US for the last 200 years. A proud symbol to learn from.<p>Next step could be the UK EU exit, FN in France will help, TTIP and with Polish NAFTA love this could be the first stepping stones for an unpolitical economic union.",1428057944

9315147,comment,9313248,9314214,0,0,ajuc,,,"I was raised in communist Europe too (and still live there, fortunately communism died:)). The food was bad, but for different reasons than now. Now food is very cheap compared to the food during communism, even in absolute terms, and people got more wealthy as well. And food is cheap mainly because there&#x27;s a price/quality trade-off that just wasn&#x27;t there. You can get great food now, and it&#x27;s not much more expansive than food during communism was, but nobody buys it, because you can also buy stuff that seems OK and costs 70% less.<p>Back then there was &quot;a butter&quot;, or &quot;a pig meat&quot; and you bought it. No point in having 2 different butters, right? Same with most of the stuff. If particular factory happened to make a good butter - you eat good butter, if you could buy it at all - that is.<p>And then there was secondary market - more important than the shops. People made stuff for themselves and family/friends, or for barter. And that food was good, because people did it for themselves mostly. Yes the Salmonella scare, etc - you cook your eggs and there&#x27;s no problem. The salmonella scandals mostly happened with ice creams, and very few people did icecreams by itself. The cold cuts were a lot better than most of the stuff people buy today (99% meat, not 50% meat like the cheap wędliny of today). And no insane amount of various sugars in everything. Yes there was the problem of no vet control over the meat, but the only reason you could possibly want such control was a parasite, that was very rare anyway (and small farmers with 2 pigs and a cow each wasn&#x27;t a good einvironment for the parasites to spread). Of course if you had vet friend you took the meat to him/her and gave him a few cold cuts for checking the meat for you. It was a whole secondary (hidden) economy.<p>Also now food is cheap so you can eat meat and sweets every day. And modern processed food is carefuly designed so you can eat it non-stop and want more. Natural food usually has some secondary tastes that make you stop after a while. The end result is - people eat much less healthy now, despite having more money, and better food available.<p>Of course widespread alcoholism and lack of modern drugs during communism nullified all the statistic benefits of better diet, except that there was no obesity.",1428057201

It seems to be common sense that SQL-on-Hadoop just like an apple-on-orange is not a great idea in terms of performance. Limited success in attempts such as Hive on Hadoop seem to prove this so far. Using low-level programming languages such as C++ with RDBMSs is also possible (see e.g. SQLAPI). However, described above advantages of RDBMSs most likely vanish if you do so.&quot;<p>Actian Vortex has shown that you can have a fully ACID compliant database running on top of Hadoop all while providing exceptional performance.\n<a href=""http://wwwcdn.actian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AAP-Hadoop-SQL-Edition-Benchmark.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwcdn.actian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AAP-Hado...</a>",1428055579

But there are short term consequences to a Grexit for Greece, the long term consequences may be good but immediately you&#x27;ll be looking at; capital controls so people can&#x27;t move their money around, Euros being forcibly converted to drachma, Greek banks going bust (combined with capital controls that isn&#x27;t fun), a temporary inflation spike.<p>So short term Greece&#x27;s social problems will be exacerbated - and that is the problem, arrogance suggests that there won&#x27;t be a problem.

An F-35 taking out the perpetrator&#x27;s training camps could have save a bunch of innocent lives. One of the worst genocides in history (Rwanda) featured machetes being used to hack millions of people to death. How great would an F-35 been against the Nazis? How many millions of people could have been saved?<p>Weapons aren&#x27;t evil. Evil is what&#x27;s evil. Burying one&#x27;s head in the sand à la Chamberlain led to the extermination of millions. The Khymer Rouge had no advanced weaponry and slaughtered millions.<p>In Gulf War I, 35,000 total deaths, in no small part because of smarter weapons. An entire country liberated from the Iraqis in just over a month.<p>How would advanced weaponry have changed the game in wars across history?<p>Even the Iraq war, which has been one of Anerica&#x27;s longest has resulted in about 500,000 deaths.

8931704,comment,8930930,8930930,0,0,jboggan,,,"I hunt elk in the Idaho panhandle and have witnessed the changes that the wolf packs have brought to the area over the past ten years.<p>The current situation with controlled hunting of the wolves is vastly preferable to the previous state of affairs where locals felt the need to take matters into their own hands because the Fish and Game authorities were not able to control things (and when given license to do so the state authorities manage the animal populations admirably).  The destruction the wolves brought to the elk population isn&#x27;t as big of an issue (though in our area the total numbers dropped by half when the wolves arrived in force) as the damage they were doing to animal husbandry in the area.  Wolves are like humans in that they sometimes kill for sport - in one case a rancher had over 100 sheep killed over the weekend by three wolves, throats ripped out but not eaten.  This was an extreme event but not surprising given the extensive low-level damage that farmers and ranchers experienced in those areas.<p>There was also a growing discomfort in the area due to the wolves&#x27; general fearlessness around humans and several threatening incidents which thankfully didn&#x27;t result in any injuries.  They can grow to be seven feet from nose to tail and weigh over 150 pounds - and when you hear two dozen of them howling around you in the woods it will chill your blood in a very special way, no matter how well armed you are.  Thankfully now they are much more skittish and are not as aggressive towards people - they are quite intelligent and know that the rules have changed for us.  It&#x27;s actually incredibly hard to fill a wolf tag, the actual success rates for the hunters were at least an order of magnitude lower than predicted in the first seasons.  Wolf hunting success rates are less than 1%, whereas elk hunting success rates average more around 20% [1]<p>One issue is that these aren&#x27;t even the right variety of wolves that used to roam these areas, before the era of human game management. It would almost be like environmental activists bemoaning the loss of black bear territory in Virginia and replacing them with grizzlies.  Once a few wandered into the D.C. suburbs the locals might get a little upset.<p>Ultimately it boils down to trade-offs.  How much economic activity and tax revenue would we mind foregoing in order to maintain an abstract good of environmental balance?  This is a hard problem when both sides of that equation are well-defined, but in this case the definition of environmental balance varies radically, especially when trying to reconstruct some unmeasured (by comparable modern methods) pre-existing state.<p>1 - <a href=""https://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/docs/fgNews/2012feb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/docs/fgNews/2012feb.pdf</a> (page 3)",1421960243

It&#x27;s not something that responds to the kinds of Moore&#x27;s Law efficiency gains that can be achieved in the CS realm -- it requires the irreducibly expensive commodity of human time and effort.<p>The fact that this kind of time and effort investment is irreducibly expensive is why huge mega-corporations like Apple and Google have such an intrinsic advantage in this department.

8931699,comment,8923721,8928964,0,0,mafribe,,,"Regarding &quot;What, the New York Times wasn&#x27;t objective enough for you?&quot;:<p>You really don&#x27;t understand (or pretend you don&#x27;t understand) how\nmodern newspapers work.<p>1. Newspapers have ideological bias. In terms of domestic news, it&#x27;s a\n   liberal newspaper, so would automatically add a sexist anti-male\n   spin.<p>2. Journalists are under heavy deadline pressure and badly\n   paid. Typically most stories in a newspaper like the NYT are\n   slightly edited press releases from some PR agency. The corrupt\n   games journalists who are trying to cover up their wrong doings\n   know this and produce press releases that smear GG, knowing that\n   mainstream news outlets like the NYT will uncritically print them.\n   You only need to look at the Wikipedia article for Chelsea Van\n   Valkenburg (who currently calls herself Zoe Quinn) to see a prime\n   example of a PR-agency hit-piece. Having worked in PR and\n   journalism, I can smell the PR-style writing from a million miles.<p>3. Newspapers like the NYT are doing financially very badly and are\n   desparate for page-views. And the damsel-in-distress narrative\n   reliably generates such page-views. That&#x27;s why the likes of\n   Sarkeesian, Chelsea Van Valkenburg (aka Zoe Quinn) and John Walker\n   Flynt (aka Brianna Wu) use them, and that&#x27;s why the NYTs of this\n   world print them.<p>Rest assured that the NYT writer responsible for editing the press\nrelease you linked to has done no fact-checking of substance.<p>As to  &quot;because of the way that GamerGate works&quot;: I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s the other way round. Since there is no organisation, no formal membership, everybody can claim to be GG; moreover, Sarkeesian, Chelsea Van Valkenburg (aka Zoe Quinn) and John Walker\n   Flynt (aka Brianna Wu) et al and their friends have strong financial incentives to run false flag operations, see their Kickstarters and Patreons and media adulation. So the only reasonable default assumption must be that they are running false flags. This default assumption should only be reversed in the presence of concrete, actionable evidence that would work in a court of law. So far none of this has been forthcoming.<p>I would also like to point out that the police clearly doesn&#x27;t take these claims seriously, for otherwise we&#x27;d probably have seen some people being arrested or charged. After all anonymity on the internet is hard these days, and beyond the abilities of most.",1421960182

There is an impressive level of polished UX spanning every aspect of Slack that is matched by very few apps anywhere.  Everything from the on-boarding to the way mobile push notifications happen when you&#x27;re afk, to the way it automatically gives you discounts for inactive users is just incredibly well designed.<p>You didn&#x27;t even mention the integrations, which are where Slack makes everything else look like amateur hour.  There are over 50 turn-key integrations, each of which is impeccably designed and offering comprehensive coverage of the service&#x27;s features that you might want to wire into Slack.  Then there are another half-dozen more flexible integrations ranging from webhooks to full API access that give you more granular control and customizability.<p>Saying that the media posting and search are merely cosmetic is an understatement.  Imagine the delight of posting a link to a Google doc, then finding the content of the document indexed and available in search.  This goes far beyond cosmetic, Slack is executing on the vision of being the actual go-to communication platform for a whole team, potentially taking a major bite out of email in a way few things have been able to in a professional setting.<p>I also find it very strange that you think it&#x27;s higher value for <i>non</i> tech folks.  For me, having GitHub (commits, PRs), CI, exception notification, system monitoring, and ticketing system all wired in, and the quality of the presentation of that information is what puts Slack head and shoulders above HipChat which does most of the same things, just not nearly as well.",1421960165

As senior dev then, I never got to approve the design before it got out and I can still remember the horror when I witnessed what he had done.<p>I ended up trying a whole bunch of different ways to solve the problem, one of which was very similar to this method. As the author points out however, this does not work in IE8 among other things, and at the time this was a requirement... I ended up using different combinations with different levels of quality depending on the browser, a true nightmare which ended up eating a third of the budget for no justifiable reason.<p>In any case, the fact that we have to go through tricks like this to achieve both transparency and decent compression is pretty disappointing. But what I find maybe even sadder is the amount of resources we sometimes spend on things which seem incredibly frivolous, to me anyway.

Expressing an encoded fact that translates to &quot;Obama is the president.&quot; is far too simplistic.  It does not take into account the proper context (president of the USA), and time period (from January 20th, 2009 to the current time) and so on.<p>These contexts: conversation (were we talking about politics?), location (USA, Russia, etc.), all need to be captured as best as possible and appropriately considered when trying to apply a learned fact.  Maybe the context is hypothetical (talking about an alternate history where McCain won the election) or fantastical (talking about President Garrett Walker in the TV show House of Cards).<p>The existing systems I&#x27;ve seen can&#x27;t really handle all of that.<p>Somehow we humans are generally good at figuring out which sets of contexts are appropriate to apply in a given situation, and doing it quickly.

Note that they could use a drone of their own for this, too, and theirs can fly higher and probably have a better camera, so you&#x27;d have to be pretty diligent to make sure you aren&#x27;t &#x27;followed&#x27;.<p>And if you&#x27;re attaching remotely-controlled explosive/incendiary devices onto your drone, then your risk factors have just gone up by a degree I can&#x27;t even begin to estimate. I think a capacitor that would short out the electronics and memory would be enough, as long as you&#x27;re careful about not getting any fingerprints or DNA samples on there.<p>This is fun to think about, though!<p>I suppose that if I were to do this, I&#x27;d have my drone go somewhere with only one aerial entrance that I&#x27;m surveilling, to make sure no other drone/person follows it in (e.g., train/subway tunnel, storm drain, etc) that has many different entrances/exits that I could use to recover the drone - if there are enough of these, I could go in and recover my drone before the police could reasonably place each one under surveillance/show up in person.

For eg. say you ingest tweets realtime via a Storm pipeline & give me a running time series of how many tweets were from which city. Meanwhile, you squirrel away these tweets in hdfs so the offline MR job runs later & gives you exact counts.<p>3. Small-data ML - The result of #1 is typically a dataset of modest size ( few MB - few GB ) that can be ingested into your favorite ML solution ( too numerous to mention) for predictive analysis & BI purposes.<p>4. Soft &quot;AI&quot; - Using #2 + #3 in intelligent ad serving, traffic routing, realtime pricing to match inventory ( eg. there are several hotels in Las Vegas who reprice rooms based on number of passengers from commercial flights arriving into Vegas, local weather (sunny,rainy etc.), industry convention dates & such - all the ML + AI done out of a tiny office in SF), electricity regulation (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280315"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8280315</a>) etc.<p>5.

If the same programmer (or team) is maintaining &quot;both sides&quot; of an object&#x27;s interface, i.e. both implementing the behavior of the object AND consuming the object in their application code, I think we can assume that they&#x27;ll know that if they change one side they&#x27;ll need to immediately change the other.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with Rob Ashton&#x27;s points, though. In his blog post, Rob trivializes the utility of third-party libraries:<p><pre><code>    > * These [libraries] are either replicable in a few \n    >   hours work, or easily extended via a pull request.\n</code></pre>\nThis is simply not the case with any truly useful library. Useful libraries often represent years of careful design work and debugging. (Think networking libraries, UI frameworks, etc.)<p>He also underestimates the amount of time it takes to continuously change application code to keep up with breaking changes from third-party libraries:<p><pre><code>    > * These [libraries] can be forked for your \n    >   project and changes merged from upstream with \n    >   little effort.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, if the library distributes a breaking change, it may require many, many hours of code changes and re-testing to make sure everything&#x27;s still working properly. Hours that could be spent building new features. For that kind of tradeoff there&#x27;d better be a damn good reason for the change: Improved security or performance or ease of use.",1421959276

Changing the semantics of interfaces is generally a bad idea once you have code depending on them whether it be within your application or a library. Where open/closed falls down is that it requires that you subclass just for _adding_ new methods to an interface. You&#x27;re not effecting any existing code but you&#x27;re still introducing entropy into your codebase.",1421959272

Personally, I love using Ruby because its ecosystem lets me rapidly and succinctly build ideas and mesh together APIs and the incoherence of the web in a clean way. But I&#x27;ve absolutely hated the ruby experience when building number crunching programs and desktop apps, here I found python to be a much more robust solution.<p>For command line apps on the other hand I really like Go and C, because I hate having to wait for dynamic languages runtime to load before I can run my command.

8931528,comment,8930825,8930825,0,0,tptacek,,,"Their &quot;Security&quot; section is a bit naive. The questions it poses go all the way back to the 1990s. If the Jericho Forum had started a VC fund, this page would be their investment thesis. The 2000s saw a wave of companies try to capitalize on &quot;deperimiterization&quot;, some with huge capex requirements (one NAC startup had designed and contract fabbed their own MIPS core). They all flopped.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s true that firewalls are less effective in 2015 than they were in 1998. The problem is: customers don&#x27;t buy on effectiveness, they buy on cost-benefit. Firewall effectiveness can drop by 90% and they will still have a better cost-benefit than the alternatives. There&#x27;s a reason for that: firewalls are the most straightforward network implementation of Saltzer & Schroeder&#x27;s principles, and those principles are probably Right. Everywhere. In code. On the network. In identity and access management.<p>Why is 2015 different? &quot;The cloud&quot;? If &quot;the cloud&quot; is what&#x27;s changed, <i>that</i> should be the thesis: we need security solutions for the cloud. Unfortunately, that is also a tired thesis.<p>Similarly: the shift from prevention to recovery seems like a manifestation of the narrative bias. Sure, there are lots of newsworthy cleanups, and one very successful consulting- to- product- to- consulting pivot company in that space. But customers don&#x27;t derive the same value from recovery as from prevention. The dirty secret of &quot;recovery&quot; work --- forensics, attribution, &c --- is that it&#x27;s driven largely by legal compliance concerns, and probably doesn&#x27;t have a great intrinsic ROI.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s an opportunity for a &quot;full stack&quot; vertically integrated insurer informed by a compliance and forensics practice.<p>There are markets that seem to work the way VCs want security to work. For instance, mobile happens, and all the sudden you can build and 10+x a company that just does for mobile apps what Google Analytics does for web pages. Security just doesn&#x27;t get valued by customers that way.<p>Also: &quot;if you fight fire with fire, you&#x27;re just going to get burned&quot;... what does that even mean?

I love to code - while I am decent at it, I&#x27;m not a 10xer. I probably code 30-50% of my time at work. I&#x27;m pretty broad in my interests and, since I currently work in research, I move from one area to another. In the last 3 years, I&#x27;ve professionally written code in Java, Python and Go.

Very serious about changing my job and getting out of research. I&#x27;ve gotten interviews lined up at the heavy hitters but I am extremely nervous. Previously, I failed to get offers from some major league software firms (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, NetApp). I also interviewed at some small, exciting startups and failed to past their dev interviews.<p>I&#x27;m in a place where my confidence is shattered. I have recruiters setting me up interviews as a senior dev. My wife isn&#x27;t in tech and she is being supportive. Says I should be confident since I have so much experience and am a pretty strong technical person. When I look at myself, I see lots of breadth but no depth (oh and no management experience to speak of).<p>A related issue. I have a weak memory. As a regular person, my memory is probably average. As a developer, it is weak indeed. I have 5 languages listed on my resume - I&#x27;ve written code in each of them. But I&#x27;ve messed up programming interviews because of minor slips - one time I didn&#x27;t get passed the phone screen because I couldn&#x27;t implement a Singleton in Java and Python.

After I left, it would fly to a second site, drop payload, and proceed to a third for later recovery.<p>If I really took it seriously, I would have several pre-programmed abort procedures, and a sachet of thermite powder with an electrically-triggered magnesium igniter affixed to the control electronics.<p>You don&#x27;t actually need to recover the drone if your margins are high enough, but you do absolutely need to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t end up intact in the wrong hands.

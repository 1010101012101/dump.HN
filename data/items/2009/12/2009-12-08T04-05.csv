Master's students are expected to do the coursework and get out.  I was actively discouraged from even doing a Master's Thesis and I was told doing one was almost unheard of in the department.  PhD students are in research labs right away and are guaranteed funding, which leaves essentially no room for Master's students to do research or teaching assistantships.<p>This arrangement worked well for me, since I wanted to do a lot of coursework and get into industry, but it would have been a horrible place to test my aptitude for and enjoyment of research.<p>On the other hand, a friend of mine got a Master's in HCI at Michigan and did a bunch of research and had funding for 3 of his 4 semesters.

983040,comment,982803,982924,0,0,coffeemug,,,"It's not that simple. The FTL addresses two fundamental problems with flash - slow random write performance and wear leveling. It works beautifully on consumer hardware, but performs rather poorly in an enterprise environment. For some workloads you can squeeze a lot more than 5-10% improvement out of the drives. But that's not the interesting part (most of today's workloads are read-intensive anyway).<p>The interesting part comes from being able to execute existing operations in fundamentally different ways. When you're not restricted to sequential reads you can implement a huge chunk of database internals differently - different concurrency models, different implementations of certain joins, etc. This is where the bulk of the performance improvement comes from.<p>Once you do this, you realize that a traditional bottleneck (I/O) is completely blown away. Suddenly, all kinds of things nobody ever bothered to optimize become performance bottlenecks (for example, the query plan is traditionally interpreted, not compiled to native code - not good enough once you get an I/O subsystem that's 250 times faster than what you used to have).<p>Once you get rid of the software bottlenecks, you realize that you're limited by the bus. Since SSDs are highly parallelized devices, you have to change the way you interleave operations for optimal performance. That alone is another order of magnitude.<p>In three years or so, the flash manufacturers will put chips on the SSDs that will allow you to send down programs to them (not unlike the shaders in video cards). That will likely be a bigger revolution than SSDs themselves. Where we are now is just the beginning.<p>You're right that we haven't shown any evidence that our approach is anything but a niche. We will. This stuff just takes a long time to build.",1260247471

983021,comment,982840,982840,0,0,dasht,,,"Here is a hypothesis which can be refuted: ""There does not exist any naturally occurring genotype whose existence is not explicable by a process of natural selection in the context of non-directed mutation.""   Let's call that the DarwinWins hypothesis.<p>The DarwinWins hypothesis is logically equivalent to the statement that all naturally occurring genotypes are explicable by a process of natural selection in the context of non-directed mutation.  It's useful, though, to state it as I did the first place... the ""there does not exist"" form, because:<p>If the DarwinWins hypothesis is true, then the hypothesis of intelligent design is false.  This is a problem for intelligent design advocates because so many genotypes have been reasonably explained as the result of natural selection and non-directed mutation.   If you want to prove that intelligent design even has a <i>chance</i> of being true, then you must prove the negation of DarwinWins.  That negation is:<p>There exists a feature, Y, inexplicable by natural selection and non-directed mutation.   You could call that hypothesis, DarwinLoses.   Proving that DarwinLoses is true would not prove intelligent design true, but it would prove that DarwinWins is false.  And intelligent design can only possibly be true if DarwinWins is false.   So if you want to argue for intelligent design, you must provide some proof that DarwinLoses is true.<p>In other words, you must come up with an observation of a single, naturally occurring genotype, Y, which can not be accounted for by natural selection and non-directed mutation.  That would be your ""black swan"" ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a> ) that disproves DarwinWins.<p>In your comments on that other blog, you offered one suggestion: the eyes of higher animals.  Unfortunately for your case, the complexity of the eye is hardly a surprising outcome in the DarwinWins case.  (E.g., c.f. <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/change/grand/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/change/grand/</a> )<p>Now, it is true that DarwinWins is as impossible to prove with absolute certainty as hypotheses such as ""No elves with magical powers exist.""   However, the NoElves hypothesis is a very effective and simple theory of why no direct or indirect evidence for magical elves has ever been observed in a controlled experiment.   We would say that the YesElves counter-hypothesis lacks any evidence whatsoever to support it.  Elf believers might be upset and say ""But you haven't yet proved with absolute certainty that there are no magical elves!"" and they would be correct - but they are being unscientific when they say ""I'm pretty sure there are those elves!""<p>Similarly, intelligent design fans, who must embrace DarwinLoses if they have even a chance to be correct, have yet to show one single piece of evidence against DarwinWins.  Meanwhile, lots of evidence in support of DarwinWins has been collected, again, and again, and again.<p>We don't teach the YesElves hypothesis in biology or physics class as an open-minded alternative to NoElves.  We don't regard YesElves as a viable scientific theory.  I.D. (DarwinLoses) has about as much logical and empirical support as YesElves... it is hard to take I.D., in the form you are arguing for it, any more seriously than YesElves.",1260246837

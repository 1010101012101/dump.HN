Instead of returning an integer, you call exits() which uses a string argument. The fact that Ken Thompson and Rob Pike made this design choice for Plan 9 is interesting. This is just a related fact, not an attempt to argue that void main is acceptable in standard ansi/iso C.",1291715903

It is morally correct, perhaps mandatory depending on your beliefs, to value your own life as much as another person's, especially one climber valuing his own life as much as another's.  You have to balance the odds of dying yourself against the odds of saving another person.  Plus, under those conditions you would be risking several lives -- an entire team -- on helping a single person who has a slim chance of survival, in a situation where the rescuers have little more strength than what is required to sustain and control their own bodies.  This assessment might be considered unduly pessimistic if there were not plenty of deadly history supporting it, but there is.  Therefore, it seems like an easy decision to me.

They're ND ratings, and while technically part of Naval Special operations, not SEALs.  There are probably some special missions where Naval divers have done something special opsy (tapping undersea cables, or salvaging a foreign nation's warship without their knowledge or consent), but it's not routine.  Naval diving techniques are basically adapted commercial techniques, and in a lot of cases are more conservative and safer than what cheap commercial contractors use.<p>SEALs are probably never qualified Naval divers, unless they start out as Naval divers and then switch to SEALs.<p>What SEALS do -- Combat diving, combat swimming, etc. is called ""military diving"".  That tends to be dangerous, although not as much due to the diving aspects (it's a lot of oxygen or other rebreather use at shallow depths, undersea scooters for long transits, etc.), as due to the other people trying to kill you.

In fact most follow the majority of your advice without having read your post, although that doesn't make it any less valid.<p>But what I'm really trying to ask, is I'm wondering if in ten years the maturity of the average young founder has changed. Are the people who start tech startups at 21 a different type of people than those who started them in the previous bubble? What changed? Where did the arrogance go? Or am I just hanging out with the wrong crowd?",1291712880

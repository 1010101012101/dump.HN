4171228,comment,4170959,4170959,32,0,tatsuke95,,,"Facebook will struggle to make the next leap (IMHO, of course) because there's a disconnect between how users want to use it, and how Facebook wants/needs you to use it.<p>Outside of the sub-group of individuals who thrive on sharing every aspect of their life, most people want Facebook to be a fancy email.  There's all your friends; you can talk with them and literally see what they're up to .  And to be honest, the platform is great for that.<p>Facebook, on the other hand, needs you to be an information sharing and data providing machine, talking about brands and products, all while doing whatever they can to entice (or trick) you into putting your information in the public domain.  They want to you be connected with <i>everyone</i>.  People are learning that's a lot of work.<p>The problem is that the more Facebook pushes the latter, the worse the former -- the user experience -- <i>has</i> to get.  Nobody wants to stare at ads and feel like they're being ""watched"" (by both Facebook and other connections) while they ""engage"" with friends.  As the author discovered...it's odd.",1340884714

4171225,comment,4170927,4171143,4,0,vidarh,,,"As a demonstration of the difference in barriers: When I was 10 I wanted to learn assembly. I didn't have any books about it. None of my friends did. This was 1985, so I didn't have internet access (nor would I have a modem for another 7 years). My local library had some low level books on electronics with vague descriptions of how CPU's worked. None of the local book stores had anything.<p>We ""knew"" we had to get machine instructions into memory somehow, but we didn't know how they were encoded, and we didn't know anything about how even BASIC was encoded in memory on our C64's. But we tried to figure it out, and got pretty much nowhere. At some point we resorted to trying to POKE the names of BASIC keywords into memory. Not only was it not assembler, it's not even how C64 BASIC does it. Our efforts petered out.<p>After ages I got hold of a pirated copy of an assembler written in BASIC that I could start figuring out. It got me a bit further, but not much. It was first one or two years later I finally got hold of decent quality assembler and tutorials and started learning assembler properly.<p>I do think it's sad that programming is not made more ""visible"", though. E.g. take automation. Most OS X apps supports being automated with AppleScript, but how many users even know it exists? Increasingly Linux applications supports automation via DBus, but it's the same situation.<p>I've not seen widespread usage of cross-application automation since ARexx on AmigaOS, which turned a large number of casual users into programmers (even if it was ""only"" for simple stuff to automate their own workflows) despite how horribly lacking ARexx is in user-friendliness, simply because it helped them get their stuff done better and they could start small (one line scripts to tell an application to do something when they pressed some icon, for example) and build on that.<p>Just making automation tools more discoverable would be a major step towards getting people more interested.",1340884690

I understand the model, and oblige with google (though not g+ as it is pretty quiet in my neck of the woods). But to not only give them the value of my data but also have them go around changing things like registered email without so much as a heads up is a slap in the face. It's like a conceited bus monitor that just goes ahead and ""does what's best for me"". I'm an adult; I know what email address I prefer to use.<p>Not only that, but the utter lack of transparency is concerning to say the least. There is this monstrous set of data--PII--that this company holds and who's to say the bus monitor doesn't all of a sudden decide that's it's best for me if they provide this data to Experien.

Here is an excerpt from that section.<p>""As time goes on, your thought process will start to be based more and more on your positional intuition.  Instead of explicitly weighing certain details against each other, you will instinctively be able to feel what direction the game is headed in.  This intuition does not come naturally, but instead is the result of playing hundreds and thousands of chess games.  Over the course of all those games, you will see positions similar to the one you are playing right now, and even though you may not explicitly internalize them, your subconsciousness will recognize the themes from before, and you will have some vague recollection or understanding of the position based on your prior experience.""",1340884317

We use the gaming engine to do all of the camera work, set dressing, initial lighting setups, etc. We can easily create any shot, just like Pixar does with their animated films. We use this ability to iterate on the story in the context of the fully edited film as we constantly increase production value in each scene.<p>Then, when a scene is solid, we move on to film-quality lighting and rendering. Our facial capture is done at 120fps with up to four RED Epic cameras, each with special stereo hardware we've developed (so up to eight 5.5 MP images are captured simultaneously 120 times a second). Along with the mo-cap data for actors, this allows us to finish the film entirely within the computer.<p>We're currently looking into Crytek's engine, and I guess we'll look into Source Filmmaker now too. It's a great time to be making films with the computer.<p>Sadly, the VC industry is completely dry in this area. I wonder what's up with that?",1340882762

It's like any good bayesian filter, it learns over time what interests you. You can of course give it a push in the right direction by putting people in acquaintances, or hiding specific people from your timeline. (People in your acquaintances don't show up as often in your newsfeed).<p>This post just shows that you most likely don't understand the full feature set of Facebook and how to best optimize your social graph (not that this is your fault). Facebook has some of the <i>best</i> machine learning for figuring out what is relevant to me. I'd probably argue that you click on too many memes and don't interact with your friends as much if this is what it is serving you.<p>Don't drop Facebook, just learn how to use it. 
I personally don't use Facebook for interacting with that many friends. I have about 96% of my friends as acquantiances. I have a small set of about 10 people as friends, and I subscribe to about 100~ people.

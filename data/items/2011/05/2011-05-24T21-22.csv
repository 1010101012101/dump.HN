Heck, let's make it ten grand, just so you don't have to skimp. And a lease on a new 5-series is, what, $600 a month? This is all perfectly affordable on a $110K salary.<p>I'd never advise anyone to lease a car rather than buying one with cash, but actually I reckon three international holidays a year is a <i>great</i> way to spend money.

If only because I'd have to then later clean up said code.<p>I'll back this up with an anecdote. At a relatively small company I used to work for, the CEO was someone who used to code, some 17 years ago. However, he recently decided that he knows enough about coding to act as the lead developer for that company's flagship product. He then proceeded to drive development into the ground, arguing over the merits of using malloc instead of calloc, globals over locals, and the beauty of goto's.<p>He successfully runs several multi-million dollar companies, yet his smartest move was stepping back out of the development lead position, and back to that of managing the company.<p>Did knowing how to code get him where he is today? Ultimately, no. His business savy and contacts did that.",1306274285

2581828,comment,2581801,2581801,2,0,horser4dish,,,"I like the new Gnome Shell. It feels like Ubuntu's Unity shell, but Done Right. The Shell is kind of hard to describe, because it almost- but not quite- does away with the traditional desktop/window/taskbar model. It reminds me, in a way, of OS X. It's shiny and cohesive, but also functional.<p>I liked the fact that desktops are a fluid resource: you don't define that you want 4 desktops arranged on a 1x4 grid, you simply drag a window the next desktop down and it pops another one up below it. If you empty out a desktop, it disappears and the unused desktop moves up. The integrated messaging is useful for me, since I use Facebook and Google chats constantly. It's very out-of-the-way, but still right there when you need it.<p>In terms of dislikes, it felt very strange to not have a taskbar hanging out on the bottom of the screen. I think it's something that I'll just have to get used to (once I get a build for Ubuntu with the right theme), but I for one am not ready to entirely drop the window list. I understand the rationale for taking it away, since it is distracting, but it's also an indicator of how much work my system is/isn't doing at a given time.",1306274192

Many of the ShowHNs of late have suffered from a distinct lack of detail in their landing pages. I am hoping mine does not suffer from the same problem.<p>http://www.cloudfrag.com<p>The traditional model in game server hosting (for PC games such as Minecraft, Left 4 Dead, etc.) is to charge a flat monthly fee, regardless of how often the server is used. As you are tied to one particular game when renting a server (or must pay a fee to change games) this becomes less cost-effective if you play a variety of games.<p>Cloudfrag is my attempt at solving this problem for myself and other gamers - the site lets people run their own servers, but they only pay for the time the server is actually running. This should make it a lot cheaper to have your own game server, especially if you either don't play much, or play a wide variety of games. It is currently in closed beta, and will be going to public beta soon.<p>I am keen to receive feedback on the landing page and the idea itself, so do let me know what you think.<p>Thanks,<p>Mike",1306273598

2581783,comment,2578805,2579539,1,0,Sandman,,,"Certainly. The language looks crowded to me because it looks like a mixture of several different languages at once (well, two at least).<p>You're using a markup language to define the user interface - why? If the point was to make it look more familiar to web developers then why not just let them use HTML (as in, HTML separated in it's own document)? I know, the idea of Opa is to be one language to develop the whole stack, but what you get here is an incosistent look of your language.
If you're going to let the developers define GUI along with the rest of your logic, it would be much better if it was done in a consistent way.<p>On the other hand, one could argue that an XML-like language is better for GUI development because it lends itself naturally to hierarchical structures (which a GUI certainly is). And I can actually agree with this. But in that case, I would definitely keep it separated from the rest of the code. Maybe this is just me, but I prefer the concept of separation of presentation and logic.<p>Usually, one of the best things a web company can do is to not make their developers wear the hat of a web designer, but instead hire an actual web designer who knows her job and who can create a great GUI. But I get the feeling that this person would be very confused if she had to work with 
Opa. Let the designers work with what they know best, HTML and CSS, and let the developers work on creating a logic behind this presentation layer.<p>So, I hope this comment clarified a bit what I meant when I said that Opa looks crowded.

E.g. looking at the ethics of the design the social system behind the Zimbardo prison experiments, rather than looking at the decisions of the individual actors once they're already in that environment.<p>I am somewhat interested in questions like whether or not it's morally acceptable to lie to a system or a (non-conscious) robot. At least on the surface this doesn't violate any of Kant's moral objections to deception. That is, Kant said (more or less) that the reason why lying is unethical is that it deprives the other person of their ability to make a rational decision, and our rationality is part of what makes us human, so lying is unethical because it deprives others of their humanity. So e.g. is it unethical to lie to about your age on a porn site? It might be, but if it is then we'd an entirely new framework to justify that sort of thing.<p>It almost seems like based on the power imbalances between people and algorithms, and the traditional justification against lying, it would almost be morally virtuous to teach your children to lie, as long as they're lying to a machine and not a person. (Of course a machine could be composed of people who are following an algorithm when interacting with you, but they still aren't making any sort of autonomous decisions for themselves.)<p>Anyway this type of problem is a little different than the problem of what makes the systemic design of a social system ethical or unethical, but they're both just different sides of the same coin.",1306270989

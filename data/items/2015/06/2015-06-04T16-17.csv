9660515,comment,9659697,9659697,0,0,mapt,,,"Hits on a pet idea of mine:<p>We have a major issue with rail transportation in the US.  It&#x27;s most useful in cities in a grade-separated form, but it&#x27;s simultaneously the hardest to build in cities in a grade-separated form.  The number of existing pipelines, power lines, traffic reroutes, building permits, and private property consents required to check out grows to dizzying levels of complexity.<p>One way to bypass this is to dig deep, <i>deep</i> tunnels.  Tunnels far enough down that surface settling doesn&#x27;t occur, tunnels far enough down to bypass skyscraper pilings.  To do this well, though, you need to construct as much of each station as possible in the tube itself, and only sink shafts down to that level, not whole horizontal rooms.<p>You can do that with a ~20m diameter TBM.  You buy this monster of a machine for an exorbitant amount of money, and in exchange you get to leave the walls that it constructs in place, except for some vertical elevators and a vertical stairwell directly to the platform;  No blasting, no extensive bit-by-bit excavation, no surface trenches, no access tunnels, no adjusting to separate mud and soil and rock.  Just two tracks in a big tube with a bunch of space in between them, and maybe a second level for another pair with an express line.",1433437170

9660510,comment,9660246,9660246,0,0,danso,,,"So I&#x27;m a huge supporter and fan of Sunlight and Politwoops, and agree that Twitter&#x27;s abrupt cutoff and non-explanation, as described, is off-putting...but I do not fault Twitter for taking this stand as a company.<p>1. The loss of public transparency is somewhat minimal... I mean, the reason why we are able to track politicians on Twitter in any capacity is mainly because, well, Twitter exists. This is a much different ballpark than, say, how police departments obscure their crime data by offloading it to a private piece of shit web company at taxpayer dime [1]<p>2. No one&#x27;s stopping you or anyone from creating a daily, hourly, or even by-the-minute archive of anybody&#x27;s Tweets...or even just leaving your browser open on a Twitter page for a very long time and capturing and saving the push updates. The problem to Twitter here is letting someone very publicly break their terms of service. And I doubt it&#x27;s even the TOS violation that&#x27;s the big issue...even though the methods of Politwoops are no secret (here&#x27;s the source code [2])...the impression that the average person has, when reading a story about the latest Poltiwoop catch...is that Twitter is not only a service where you will get humiliated because of a 140-character mistake, but that as a user, your mistakes are available to the public in perpetuity. If you&#x27;re thinking &quot;<i>Well, the average person knows that the stakes for social media account terms and conditions is inherently different for elected officials and will trust social media companies to honor that inherent truth</i>&quot;...then you obviously have not talked to an average person in a long time.<p>3. If you&#x27;re convinced that the average user knows that the rules/TOS are different based on publicly elected status...well, what about other public officials? What about the city manager and their staff? How about the police chief? How about individual police officers? If you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;<i>Well, obviously NOT police officers, because they are people, and they have families and are not high on the decision-making chain</i>&quot;...Another person could sanely argue that, <i>&quot;Well, every police officer has taxpayer-granted escalated privileges to deprive citizens of freedom and life, why shouldn&#x27;t we have the right to see if they say something fucked up on Twitter?&quot;</i> It&#x27;s not a simple debate, and we haven&#x27;t even gotten to other types of public figures (i.e. celebrities and other newsmakers). You sure the average person can sift the nuance and be assured that their tweets are granted the sanctity of being a non-public figure?<p>4. If you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;Well, users <i>should</i> be made more aware of how illusionary their privacy is on social media&quot;...I completely agree. However, I don&#x27;t agree that Twitter should be compelled into letting an independent organization use Twitter&#x27;s resources and break Twitter&#x27;s TOS to implicitly communicate that epiphany to Twitter&#x27;s own users.<p>[1] <a href=""http://recode.net/2014/05/05/is-your-citys-crime-data-private-property/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recode.net/2014/05/05/is-your-citys-crime-data-privat...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/sunlightlabs/politwoops"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sunlightlabs/politwoops</a>",1433437139

9660507,comment,9657515,9660432,0,0,angersock,,,"I absolutely agree that your logic is correct, for a grad student or full-time engineer.<p>But again, early-stage startups != normal business calculus.<p>Look at it this way:<p>You&#x27;ve got two buckets, one of cash and one of time. You can fulfill business goals by dipping into either or both buckets. The time bucket continually replenishes at a fixed rate but never change capacity, the money bucket may replenish unpredictably in both amount and time and have its capacity expanded (more employees, capital, whatever). If either bucket goes dry, you lose.<p>At an early stage, your cash bucket is near empty compared to your time bucket. If you&#x27;ve spec&#x27;ed your business properly (hah) and are not too unlucky (hah hah), you will never have a demand that exceeds the total available amount in the two buckets.<p>So, to fulfill demands, you pull from the time bucket, because it has the greater reserves, and because it&#x27;ll replenish as every second tics by.<p>As time goes on, though, the demands outstrip what your time bucket can handle. Your time bucket, remember, never gets larger. But, since your business is growing, the cash bucket has been getting larger, and so you start to fulfill demands out of that bucket, using contractors or vendors or whatever.<p>Eventually, you are fulfilling demands <i>entirely</i> out of the cash bucket, because you simply will never have enough time to do them in the required timeline otherwise.<p>The same rule (&quot;gotta fulfill my business demands without emptying my buckets&quot;) applies at both ends of a company&#x27;s lifecycle, but results in entirely different behavior--<i>and that&#x27;s not bad</i>.",1433437109

While some of the differences are simply regional, I have noticed one significant difference between being called an &quot;engineer&quot; versus a &quot;developer&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve found the term to closely correlate with how the organization thinks about building software and how responsibilities and decision making around what to build are broken down.<p>Companies that call programmers &quot;engineers&quot; often employ a number of other people to determine what to build. Product Managers, Business Analysts, UX specialists, etc are more commonly filing this role, while programmers simply write the code, test it, deploy, and fix it.<p>Companies that call programmers &quot;developers&quot; usually have only limited supporting staff like Customer Support and Ops to supplement the actual programming work. Programmers are often experts in an industry (like Healthcare or Finance) and often determine what to build as well as actually building it. These responsibilities are sometimes clearly stated, but more often the decision making is going on behind the scenes.",1433437098

Even if the ideal state cannot be attained, we&#x27;re really far from even an approximation of it.<p><i>You&#x27;re simply stating an endemic problem of which most semi-conscious people are aware. But, what&#x27;s your conclusion?</i><p>I&#x27;m trying to say that democracy should not be revered as much as it is, but that more importantly people tend to be ignorant of its machinations. They completely set aside hugely important details like voting systems (such that FPTP guarantees party dichotomy as per Duverger&#x27;s law), externalities, fraud, gerrymandered districts, and the idea that we should vote on people instead of policies.<p>The latter is ass-backwards by all measures. Vote policies and have the people fill in the demand for their execution. Instead you have a system that incentivizes deceptive and bombastic political campaigns with an extremely narrow ideological set. When you refuse to participate, you&#x27;re told you can&#x27;t complain. When you <i>do</i> participate and your candidate turns out to be a total actor, then again it&#x27;s your fault for electing them, but remember, folks - democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others. Which is why the way we do democracy is absolutely infallibly correct.<p><i>It&#x27;s more likely that your conception of my conception is simplistic and incorrect.</i><p>Perhaps, but your original comments were quite rude in the way you shoehorned life into a primitive idea of &quot;voting&quot;.

This works fine in the classroom, it works OK in the workplace. It works well in most situations. The only place it breaks down is during testing.<p>Many tests verify a skill rather than knowledge. If you&#x27;re cheating then you&#x27;re masking your lack of skill by using another person&#x27;s skill as a crutch. If you&#x27;re later given the relevant qualifications and end up in a situation where other people expect to be able to rely on you having the said skill then you&#x27;re likely to fail these people.

There are of course niche programming jobs in: finance, statistics, AI, CS, gamedev, and so on but if you look at the programming industry as a whole those jobs are a tiny proportion overall (the majority are &quot;boring&quot; enterprise-style developers and web-developers: Java/Tomcat, ASP.net/MVC, PHP, RoR, and so on).<p>The thing is that the &quot;boring&quot;/average programming jobs are the silent majority. You&#x27;ll likely read in this thread tons of obscure topics and how they apply to obscure jobs, but the reality is that few programmers work in those industries, but nobody [else] is going to post just to admit that for their job they don&#x27;t need any maths day to day because it is boring and redundant.<p>This is JUST my opinion, but if you want to learn obscure topics, you&#x27;re better off spending time learning CS topics (e.g. floating point number representation/bugs/limitations, encryption/hashing/etc, binary representations, assembly, kernel inner workings, CPU inner workings, and even borderline electronics). While advanced maths has a place in some jobs, advanced CS topics seem to be useful even on the web-stack/enterprise-stack to understand where bottlenecks might be materialising.<p>Maths is not useless.

However with near-zero rates for the last 5-6 years, bonds are only making money as long as there is actual deflation (which however increases default risk) or if yields keep dropping (which beyond zero becomes some weird sort of Einstein-Bose finance where people pay others for the privilege of lending them money). In this type of environment you can&#x27;t just hold the bond to maturity and live off of the income... to cash out you must sell, so liquidity is critically important.<p>The &quot;flash crash&quot; rhetoric in the article is a red herring.  Much more troubling would be an actual fundamental shift in the market... the bonds markets are so huge that even small moves could prove to be seismic...<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that preventing this was the true purpose of QE, and is the reason that the Fed quadrupled its balance sheet with little effect on the headline CPI or other mainstream measures of inflation... however it might not be a stretch to say that the hyperinflation that all the doomers were predicting is playing out in the bond markets.

By the very act of building, you are asserting some knowledge about the future.<p>Sure, you shouldn&#x27;t go crazy and build a complex and expensive solution you don&#x27;t need today and may never need, but it&#x27;s disingenuous to claim that a lack of perfect clarity into the future justifies a complete lack of planning for the future.",1433434221

Perl has excellent libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheets.  Excel is really easy with a large amount of training material.  Even the Perl libraries are very easy to use.<p>I would never tell a user to open up a text editor on tabular data.  It is too easy to configure Excel to do the right thing each time.  Basic spreadsheet formatting takes care of a lot of problems.",1433433687

9660132,comment,9657454,9659645,0,0,zhte415,,,"The risk of zero rates is greater.  Low long term interest rates are bad, as they represent low (or zero) growth.  A sell off in bonds, especially low-risk bonds such as treasuries, is a move into interest-seeking assets, which is an appetite for risk.  This is a good thing.<p>The economy is a balance sheet, however simplified or complexified it may be made.  A low return on capital represents a low growth of capital.  In some economies with less transparent capital markets, the link to official interest rates and actual growth is difficult at best, but in more developed capital markets the cost of capital is well proxied by the interest rate.  And if the interest rate is low, the return on capital (at a macro level, totaling and summasing the micro level anecdote - micro level opinions go both ways) is low, and if that is low, then growth is low.<p>Extra:  Bond price falls indicate a move into risk.  This is especially good for people affected by stock price falls coupled with low interest rates - 401kers for example, approaching retirement age with money in growth.  Interest rates (higher) make buying annuities a lot more attractive.",1433433643

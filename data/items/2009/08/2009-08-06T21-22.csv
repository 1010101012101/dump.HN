They just realize that sometimes, to make change happen (especially change this “drastic”) is to make a lot of noise. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.<p>They want people to stop using it, instead of just refusing to design for it for 2 reasons (and maybe more):<p>1. As web designers/developers, we are passionate about people having a beautiful and pleasant web experience. If we just stop developing for IE6, everyone who hasn’t dropped it may have a lesser experience, which just wouldn’t do.<p>2. Many of them may be forced to support IE6 by their respective powers-that-be, so the only way they can stop actively supporting (designing for) it is by getting a significant amount of people to stop using it.<p>I agree with you in general. I am never a fan of over-zealousness and pushiness, but sometimes that’s the only way to get things done.",1249595893

746489,comment,746157,746229,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Google Voice is a threat to AT&T and every other potential carrier for the iPhone. Maybe AT&T didn't really have anything directly to do with GV being yanked but it sure isn't going to make carriers around the world happy to have the iphone on their network if it can go around their revenue generating functions.</i><p>How?  Most people don't make international calls with their cell-phone.  All Google Voice calls count as normal calls, and subtract minutes from your cell-phone plan, just like all other normal calls.  So if you are calling your friend to see why he's late to dinner, AT&T makes as much money off you with GV as they do otherwise.  Same with text messages; when someone sends a text message to your Google Voice number, it's relayed to your cell-phone.  If you pay to receive random text messages, you paid for that one too.  (But I assume iPhone users have unlimited SMS messages, so who cares?)<p>Anyway, AT&T loses very little here, and users gain a lot in terms of convenience.<p>(There's also the argument that Google Voice makes it easier to ditch AT&T.  That's true, but I ported my number from AT&T to T-Mobile yesterday, and it took literally 15 minutes, with no involvement from me other than ""ok, do it"".  So it's already really easy to switch away from AT&T.)<p>All in all, I don't get it.  I'm glad I have a MyTouch 3G instead of an iPhone.  Google Voice works swimmingly for me (and I even get to see a cute tshirt-wearing android every time I make a call.  Yay!)<p>I'm actually surprised T-Mobile doesn't block GV, as they have a lot more to lose.  With ""My Faves"", you get unlimited calling to 5 arbitrary numbers.  With your GV number as one of those, all your calls become free.  Now that actually costs them money.",1249595389

746481,comment,745948,746008,0,0,abalashov,,,"Yes, but it sounds like your desire to start a startup preceded your acute dislike of your job.  That's a different scenario than the one the author is targeting.<p>I had the same thing happen;  I had various business ideas and was increasingly getting the itch to go out and do my own thing, and carried that itch through three more jobs.  It is absolutely certain that the dislike of the jobs and the entrepreneurial yearning fed back on each other;  although I'm quite certain I would have disliked my jobs for the same fundamental reasons anyway, feeling less invested in them because really, inside I wanted to go out on my own no doubt made me even more miserable than I otherwise would have been if I had no such compulsion whatsoever.  Conversely, innate dislike of the jobs helped bring me closer to the jump-off point.<p>Even then, I didn't have the balls to walk away from a secure, steady paycheck.  Instead, I just started performing worse and worse;  I was up till 5 AM working on my own stuff, and, well, very obviously not showing up at 9 AM or what have you the next morning, and seemed kind of preoccupied and distracted at work too.  Eventually, I ran into my last employer who was very (understandably) demanding and had no tolerance for that kind of crap, and was summarily fired.<p>That's what gave me the kick in the ass I needed, because at that point I had a choice before me:  Do I look for my 7th job in 3 1/2 years, or do I grab this thing by the horns and find my own way to pay the (large) bills next month?  I went for the latter, and that's how it's been ever since.  But the thing is, before I got fired, I don't think there's a way I could've done that.<p>Sure, I dreamt about getting fired or laid off on innumerable occasions and halfway wished it would happen, but there's a long psychological gulf between that and just walking into your boss's office and saying you don't want the comparatively large, steady paycheck anymore.  Obviously, the gulf narrows if you have substantial savings and/or a cash reserve and/or low living expenses, but I had none of these, so, there's no telling whether I would have left eventually--I just sort of sabotaged myself into being kicked out onto the street.",1249595102

746473,comment,745958,745983,0,0,jerf,,,"No, there have been numerous other signs of relativity, going all the way back to the unexpected aberration of the orbit of Mercury that Einstein was aware of. Eventually somebody would have noticed the gravitational deflection of the stars during eclipses, too, though it could have been decades before that happened. (Not because of technology, of course, which clearly existed in Einstein's day, though just barely, but simply because nobody might have <i>noticed</i>.)<p>Einstein was definitely ahead of the curve, but wasn't running on zero data, even if we discount the purely mathematical issues, such as the inability to reconcile the lack of a reference frame in the Maxwell equations with the need for a reference frame for all other physics of the time.<p>(It might be worth pointing out here that <i>relativity itself</i> was not a new concept; now when we say ""relativity"" we mean Einsteinian relativity, but there is also, for instance, ""Galilean relativity"". Relativity wasn't a surprise, it's just nobody could make it all work out properly without contradictions until Einstein.)<p>I really recommend this online book: <a href=""http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm</a> It is both a great (IMHO) introduction to relativity, Einsteinian and otherwise, and also has a lot about history of Einstein's theory and the general state of thought at the time. I do not mean to diminish Einstein's accomplishment, because like I said he legitimately was ahead of the curve, but it wasn't quite the ""bolt from the blue"" that it is often portrayed as. All the math pieces Einstein needed had been developed, and his genius was largely the combination of figuring out how to put them together in a way that explained reality, and doing so while discarding inappropriate assumptions that were holding back the physics community at large. I'm actually more impressed by the latter, lest you think I'm trying to diminish that accomplishment; that's a hard harder than that sentence may make it sound.",1249594943

746444,comment,745924,745924,0,0,mdasen,,,"Maybe I just don't get it, but why would it be good to have information encoded on a card or passport?  Wouldn't it be better to have an ID number on the card that could then be linked up to a record on the computer?<p>Like, let's say that an officer needs my ID.  What is he going to trust more: the information stored on my card that could be tampered with or the information in their database that I don't have as easy access to?  If it just looked me up by ID number, they'd get my picture, name, address on their screen, but it would be harder for me to get in and fake that - since, even if I changed the ID number, I might be able to fake that I'm a different person until they compare the picture on file.  And heck, if each card had a unique ID, you could then determine if a card was a stolen card.  If the data is just on the card, it remains valid after being reported stolen.  Heck, cryptographically sign the ID number so people can't fake it easily.<p>Not that I'm defending or promoting whatever their aim is, but even if you agree with their aim, why put the data on the card?  Keep it secure and only have it available when the card is scanned by a legitimate person.  The card carries whether state benefits are given to a person?  How soon until someone can just switch that boolean on the card?",1249594133

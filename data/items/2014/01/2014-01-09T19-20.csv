How many websites use Google Analytics? How many serve fonts via Google Fonts? Or serve JQuery via Google? How many sites serve up ads from Google&#x27;s ad network? Google&#x27;s tentacles reach every corner of the web. Android lets Google track you across mobile and tablet. Now they can track you on desktop with ChromeOS which potentailly tracks <i>everying</i> you do in the OS. Some people are fine with this if it means a more personalised service. I find the privacy implications horrendous.<p>Consider the following scenario: you visit a site with Google Anlaytics, then a site that serves up fonts through Google, then a site that serves JQuery via Google. Then you sign into GMail to check your email and immediatly sign out after. Then you vist YouTube (signed out). Does Google join up these journeys? We don&#x27;t know. Google&#x27;s privacy policy is deliberatley vague about what they capture.<p>People simply aren&#x27;t aware of the amount of tracking that goes on. It&#x27;s clearly not in Google&#x27;s interest to be placed under greater scrutiny over what they track and record. The tech community are happy to oblige, giving Google an easy ride on such matters.",1389297486

It requires some processing power on the server, but it is designed with a &quot;scale-out&quot; architecture so you should be able to get it running cheaply at scale without major rewrites.</i><p>Custom server or public? ( fms/wowza/etc. ) How many streams per server can it handle? Why bother with a server doing relay if its only 6 people?<p><i>It&#x27;s currently iOS only, but it should work to copy the iPhone code&#x27;s structure to implement clients for all relevant platforms -- Android, WinPhone, Blackberry, web, and/or desktop.</i><p>It is my understanding that developing video chat for android is a major clusterfuck. Not only does each O/S version create crazy complications, the differences and nuances required just across phone models is a nightmare. For instance, on a Evo you need to flip the image. On a newer droid the f/b camera is reversed from the API. Its enough that developing video chat for android is a nightmare in disguise<p><i>Performance will be critical for slower devices, so you&#x27;ll need to implement it carefully.\nThe video codec is h.264 at 144x144. (We experimented with up to 320x320 and found that with current connection quality on phones, especially on urban wifi and 3G, sticking with a low-resolution default tends to produce the best user experience.)</i><p>Don&#x27;t things look like shit in 144x144 for non-group calls? Do you scale larger when its just a 1 to 1 call?<p><i>The audio codec is Opus at 16 KHz.</i><p>Are you muxing connections together on the server?

7032717,comment,7030778,7032626,1,0,_delirium,,,"I&#x27;m not entirely sure the faculty cost will be lower longer-term, but it depends on a lot of factors that influence how the market will develop, so I can&#x27;t say for sure. One reason I think it might turn out higher is that MOOCs may be taught by fewer <i>but more super-star</i> professors than traditional universities. Right now the difference between a top and a mediocre professor in pay is not huge, maybe 2x-3x. But if MOOCs succeed in producing really massive-scale courses, the most popular, charismatic professors could become real media superstars. And if they do, and the market is big and competitive enough to support it, they might be able to garner huge salaries through bidding wars between MOOC providers.<p>For example, imagine that someone like Richard Feynman, rather than giving his famous lecture series at Caltech for his regular Caltech salary, were doing it in a future era of well-developed MOOCs. He announces he&#x27;s going to do one final series of physics lectures, but he hasn&#x27;t decided which MOOC company he&#x27;s going to do it for. I bet he could negotiate a huge fee for that, much more than even a top-end professor is currently paid. Moving back to the modern day, what if, say, Elon Musk offered to teach a MOOC? You could go for a cheaper, less well-known lecturer, but then you risk looking like the 2nd-rate MOOC company compared to your competitors.<p>If that&#x27;s how the market develops, MOOCs might have to pay fees closer to what the public-speaking circuit currently pays prominent lecturers, if they want to attract the top speakers. And those fees are orders of magnitudes higher than what a professor currently makes.",1389297111

Since everyone else is making assumptions or following the intuition leaps from lots of Ph.D. work - and I don&#x27;t have that - I frequently find bad assumptions just by trying to follow what people are saying.

Innovation <i>can</i> help with that, but isn&#x27;t <i>guaranteed</i> to. Consider that some of the best-selling games on the Wii and DS were the New Super Mario Bros. games -- these were games that were so popular they <i>moved hardware</i>, and yet their core genres and mechanics are identical to the Mario games of the NES and SNES era. In fact, it could be argued that their success was exactly <i>because</i> they stuck so closely to that old formula -- other Mario games, such as the 3D platformers, don&#x27;t sell nearly as well.<p>Innovation is good when it supports the goal of creating games people want to play. Wii Sports, for example, could not be done without the Wii Remote. That was a good innovation that served both to lower the barrier of entry to games and to allow for new modes of play that people found fun. But things like the 3D of the 3DS, which Nintendo is now wisely backing away from, or the tablet on the Wii U, which substantially increased its price tag, don&#x27;t provide those same benefits. And hardware innovation alone doesn&#x27;t cut it -- it needs games like Wii Sports to support it.<p>And I think that for a company like Nintendo, third-party support is heavily overrated. The best way to get third-party support is to sell enough consoles that they can no longer ignore you, and the only way to do that is strong first-party games.",1389296203

We publish &quot;how to&quot; guides under the &quot;In 30 Minutes&quot; brand (<i>Dropbox In 30 Minutes</i>, <i>LinkedIn In 30 Minutes</i>, etc.) (1) but my company has also published two fiction titles.<p>You asked about selling books outside of the software realm. The <i>In 30 Minutes</i> guides are aimed at mainstream users, and I found through some early pricing experiments that attempting to charge more than $10 for these types of ebooks is very difficult. I have also found through more recent experiments that pricing ebook versions less than $5 leads to an immediate and sustained rise in sales.<p>I sell ebooks through Amazon, iTunes, and B&N as well as PDF versions on Gumroad. I have also made  mobi/epub versions available on Gumroad, but very few people buy them -- Amazon, Apple and Android tablet manufacturers do not make it easy to transfer these types of files to their devices, which is a roadblock to most people in my  target audience.<p>In my limited experience promoting fiction, factors such as categorization, whether or not the book is in a series, and the number of reviews on Amazon or Goodreads influence awareness and purchasing decisions. Because there is so much competition in the fiction realm, and most new titles by relatively unknown authors are priced at $4 or less, I think the reaction to an expensive fiction ebook by another unknown author would be negative.<p>For anyone who is interested in self-publishing, I wrote another HN post last year that a lot of people found useful.

In deeply nested code it can be difficult to determine whether the nesting should be say 28 or 32 spaces. In practice, most people shy away from writing such code because to many levels of nesting is hard to follow. People also prefer to write atomic 5-15 line functions in which keeping track of the nesting levels is trivial.<p>Many C# and Java-heads complain that Python lacks support for auto-completion. Which is true, the language makes it so you can&#x27;t have as sophisticated auto-completion as is available for the aforementioned languages in Visual Studio and Eclipse.

I like to call them &quot;JavaScript luddite&quot; posts: posts that worship single-digit kb apps with zero dependencies as universally good ideas.<p>This type of thinking is going to hold back frontend web development as a whole unless we address it. Disclaimer: I am on the React team.<p>&quot;API first&quot; -- just layer your API on top of whatever you&#x27;re using to implement it. Abstraction is an important part of what we do as SW engineers. This post describes a particularly leaky abstraction, which is easily fixed.<p>&quot;Small size&quot; -- cry me a river. Yes, byte size is important but it&#x27;s not more important than code reuse and all the benefits that come with it (security, dev speed, support etc). By the way, the Retina image on the blog post was 46kb over the wire which is bigger than all the JS in his app. The lesson to be learned here is that if add a single image you&#x27;ve pretty much blown away any JS savings you would have had.<p>Another thing: usually multiple server round-trips matter more than bytes down the wire.<p>&quot;Full control&quot; -- this is a legit reason. Some of the bullet points are indicative of the state of client-side JS tooling though which are fixable.<p>&quot;Special needs&quot; -- moot&#x27;s engineering challenges were not unique, they just didn&#x27;t like the trendy frameworks.

Watson is powered by 2,880 8-core IBM POWER7 processors, which AFAIK haven&#x27;t received a core bump or a die shrink since their introduction in 2011.<p>Comment 2 - POWER7 (which came out in 2009) was replaced by POWER7+ in 2012. IBM shrunk the lithography but kept the die size the same, so they used the extra space for more cache, a crypto accelerator, a compression/decompression accelerator, and some other goodies. There were able to bump up the clock speed as well.\nCore for core, POWER7+ is about a 20% improvement, but you&#x27;re right, no more cores per socket so there is no way they would see the kind of shrink described in the article if they kept the same amount of compute power.\nIBM did come out with a new blade design (Flex Systems) with denser packaging, but that combined with the faster CPU will still only get them about 2/3rd of the way there (still impressive).</i>",1389294182

5967866,comment,5967559,5967836,10,0,acgourley,,,"See my sibling comment to yours for more context. There are two main problems with the sensors in current devices. The first is that the communication layers (hardware and software) between the sensors and your applications can add 60ms or more. The rendering loop itself will add another 16ms (60fps) or 33ms (30fps). The second problem is that they fast, but not very fast. Generally phone position sensors can run 100 times a second. The OR sensors, on the other hand, run at something like 1000 times a second. This lets a processor in the goggles themselves do predictive algorithms which guess at future head motion allowing the higher level software to compensate for expected head motion.<p>The key is that humans can perceive latency around 20-30ms, and the phone is delivering around 80-100 in the best case. For what it&#x27;s worth, I did real measurements on all this before giving up on the idea myself.",1372636750

5967856,comment,5967602,5967602,1,0,privacybuff,,,"After many years dealing with VCs as an employee of startups (often very early employee) when it came time to start my own company, I knew I wanted one that would not require venture capital.<p>Making money is not that hard (for me, anyway, I think this might be a talent, but I think it&#x27;s not as rare a talent as it might seem.)  I think there are a lot of startups out there who build an Instagram when they could be building a Basecamp.<p>Further, if you&#x27;re profitable, the cost of scaling is lower.<p>The reason for this is that there are three major costs to VCs (and Paul touches on some of them).  There&#x27;s the huge distraction of dealing with them when raising money, but this also becomes and ongoing distraction of keeping them happy, and fielding their calls where they tell you some sector is hot and maybe you should pivot into it. (Much better than the bad old days when they would force bad decisions on you, or at least, I hope that is less common now.)   The second major cost is not just the equity (which Paul touches on) but the terrible, terrible, lopsided deal terms.  &quot;Standard&quot; terms are basically a ripoff that in no other sector of investing would be acceptable. (I&#x27;m talking about liquidation preferences and the manifold other ways of double dipping, stripping founders of their stock, etc.)  Yes, they get away with this because they&#x27;re investing in &quot;to the moon&quot; type businesses run by mostly young guys and this has been the culture.  But the consequence of this is that the terms are bad for employees as well. (At least founders have a big chunk of stock, for employees the shrinking of the pool is more dramatic.)<p>But the biggest cost of a VC is starting the clock.  They will put you on a track to &quot;go big&quot; which really means &quot;spend more than you&#x27;re taking in and keep raising more funds&quot;, which further dilutes you.   You do this until you die or get aquihired or are able to raise enough rounds to have a really big business.<p>Everyone seems to go into it thinking they&#x27;re shooting for the moon and that they&#x27;ll be the next Instagram.  But they won&#x27;t. (almost certainly. 1/1000? 1/10,000? 1/1,000,000,000?)<p>I think github is the model we should be striving for.  Profitable almost from day one. Reinvest the profits, grow the business.  Later if you want to take money, you can get a deal like they got.<p>And if times are tough and you need to pivot, well, at least you have cash flow to fund it.<p>I&#x27;ll never forget the experience of one company I worked for. I was in right after the founders.  They had a profitable business doing consulting right in their line of technology, which meant that the consultants were producing code that made the product more valuable.  The consultants were paying for the product team all the overhead and the company was slightly profitable.<p>As part of the deal to get venture capital, they had to shut down the consulting team and &quot;focus&quot;.  There was no focus being taken away by that team-- they were run by a manager and the rest of the company could ignore them... they just increased the value of the product on other people&#x27;s dimes.<p>So the team was shut down, then the VC firm dragged it all out for 6-8 months until the company was almost out of money, and gave us a bridge loan (really choice terms too, choice for the VC that is.)<p>They put us over a barrel.<p>It turned out the company was about 3 years too early.  They would have been well ahead of the competition when the market hit and things really took off... but by the time the VC had run them into the ground. (Forcing many other terrible decisions on them in the interim.)  They could have made it without taking VC money and would have been a $400M business.... (what one of the competitors sold for, even though they were much worse off than we were.)<p>I think this story is very common.<p>But you don&#x27;t see a lot of stories like this on HN and other &quot;startup&quot; hangouts.  You see a lot of self aggrandizing blog posts from VCs (not talking about PG here, his article is perfectly fine and he&#x27;s generally on the good side of things).<p>So, I think we have a culture of startup founders whose entire understanding of what it means to do a &quot;startup&quot; is one that lacks an undertanding of how VCs actually work and how dangerous they are.<p>And most importantly, what they really cost.",1372636597
5967855,comment,5966942,5967734,5,0,jaekwon,,,"What Lessig is asking for (see his 1999 book &quot;Code&quot;, and his plug of Palantir) is for software that can cross correlate data from multiple sources to identify leaks of information for the purpose of copyright protection. He (and others) believe that the right software can provide privacy while &quot;securely&quot; storing vast amounts of data, through &quot;immutable audit logs&quot;. The problem is, he&#x27;s wrong, and this isn&#x27;t technically possible.<p>The kind of technical naivet that believes that surveillance software can be secure and auditable, is what is allowing the NSA PRISM software to develop, and concentrating too much data. When you hear Obama claim that PRISM is transparent, he&#x27;s referring indirectly to flawed technical arguments.<p>So no, of course Lessig won&#x27;t argue for PRISM.

And the 14th amendment wouldn&#x27;t allow for granting one class of citizens rights over/at the expense of another.<p>As for the bigger picture, in my mind the debate over whether or not the Constitution is &quot;living&quot; is silly.  Of course it is living.  Unless you can send every case back to 1787 you&#x27;ll never know what the founders intended.  You interpret the meaning of what they wrote through the context of your modern life.  Trying to use their writings of the time for context just exponentially increases the text that can be construed for any purpose, and you still end up reading the context through the context of modern life.  And the founders almost certainly had different and unique interpretations of the constitution that they all voted for.<p>If a religious majority took over all three branches of government, then what can you do?  The constitution won&#x27;t save you.  The constitution grants them the power to look at it through their own lens.  No other lens is possible.  The constitution is &quot;living&quot; then whether you want it to be or not.",1372636538

If not, and you&#x27;re seriously trying to argue that eating a small amount of potatoes exposes one to cancer risk, it would be more enlightening if you posted an actual comparison between the levels of carcinogens in a sack of lowly potatoes and a bottle of red wine. Hint: there&#x27;s a reason the bottle of red wine you bought at the store has a warning label and the sack of potatoes you bought with it doesn&#x27;t.<p>In any case, while I appreciate your attempt at being clever, the whole point is that we&#x27;re <i>not</i> talking about abuse here, we&#x27;re talking about <i>moderate</i> consumption.

But if you&#x27;d like to believe that moderate consumption of wine or beer is about as healthy as eating fruit and fish regularly, or that eating fruit and fish regularly is about as risky as having a glass or two of wine every night, I respectfully hope you don&#x27;t become a nutritionist.",1372636464

This incentivizes VCs to create megafunds so that they can have proportionally mega salaries.<p>Seed stage investments come at a totally different operating cost.<p>Seed-stage investing is pretty hard with a megafund because they are so expensive operationally. VCs would much rather write a 50M check in a growth round for 33% of a company than a 100 $500K checks for 5% of each company. They might have to talk to 20 companies for the growth rounds to make 1 investment, but they&#x27;d probably have to talk to thousands to make the 100 investments in seed rounds. That means they need a bigger staff and that 2% model won&#x27;t work.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve heard VCs say that the only reason they write small checks in seed rounds is so that they have a strong relationship with the founders and pro-rata rights if the company happens to blow up.<p>I suspect that VC salaries will go down like crazy, and they&#x27;ll be forced to rely on carry for the funds earnings.

There are resources tracking counter parties.<p>For example the canonical way to structure a music app would be an activity (gui) for visuals, a content provider to provide the library and a service to play the actual audio.  There is no requirement for these to be in the same app/process and it is pretty much immaterial to the code.  But if your activity is communicating with the service (eg to send play/pause/next in one direction and getting the current play position and file in the other) then Android does housekeeping to make sure the right thing happens such as what happens when either side crashes or exits.<p>Android can do memory management within a process - for example if you switch to your email app, the music playing service can keep going, and the activity can be terminated (it is usually told).<p>This isn&#x27;t remotely the same thing as swapping out pages as is done by the kernel.  Additionally a whole bunch of the pieces have no kernel representation (eg a content provider).  There is an IPC mechanism (binder) that has both kernel and user space components working in harmony.<p>To have something analogous in C, your &quot;app&quot; would be a large number of shared libraries (dozens), and they would be dynamically loaded and unloaded.  They would talk to each other and shared libraries in other processes.  There would be garbage collection, lifetime management and possibly reference counting.  Calls into them could be asynchronous, as well as calls out.  Managing all that would be non-trivial &quot;scaffolding&quot;.<p>> ... almost everything has near-seamless support for calling C API functions<p>Dalvik already has that - using JNI.  The pattern is to implement your interface to Android in Java and then call through to C when you need to.<p>The problem with Go is that it isn&#x27;t designed to play well with others.  It doesn&#x27;t support dynamically linking, and expects to own the process - being in charge.  The work the posting is about is some toolchain hacks that make it so a dynamically loadable binary is produced instead of an executable.  There is then work to make the Android API available which is non-trivial, and Java flavoured.<p>> I would be plenty happy if they would just provide a native C API like GNU/Linux does<p>The &quot;native&quot; API it would provide would need to be analogous to libc, glib, X (and extensions like xrandr), gnome, systemd/udev, dbus, sdl, ibus, garbage collection, shm, reference counting etc all combined (in addition to whatever I forgot).

I guess the 20th century war against socialism (&quot;the means of production in the hands of those who work it&quot;) and worker&#x27;s organizations and parties doesn&#x27;t come much into play into these analyses.  Up to the bickering a few months ago in Wisconsin with Walker - although we&#x27;re so far down the road, that example isn&#x27;t very useful as a specific case.<p>Yes, the entrepreneurial middle manager starting his own business, this is the source of income inequality!  Meanwhile, half the Forbes 400 inherited their way onto the list.  Where&#x27;s the plucky entrepreneur in that equation?  Even &quot;self-made&quot; people like Warren Buffett had a congressman father and a grandfather with a chain of stores.  Not exactly a guy pulling himself up by his bootstraps.<p>I mean, the fact that this speech was made to investors is a signal.  Not the tone, but the fact that it&#x27;s investors who are the ones who sit and hear these things.  The programmer in the trenches, working 50-60 hours a week creating wealth is not a part of these decisions on production.<p>There&#x27;s a good documentary called &quot;Born Rich&quot; that is on Youtube right now.  I would recommend people watch it.  This is who the money goes to, not the plucky, hard-working entrepreneur.  Blogs are filled with stories of angels and VCs backstabbing founders.  As is HN.  And the founders usually get the best deal in the company, far better than schlub programmers.  Even hackers of the caliber of Jamie Zawinski have attested to this.<p>This idea of income inequality happening because some hard-working founder gets all of the money is a complete farce.  Propaganda even.<p>If we want to really get into a discussion of this - just who are the &quot;limited partners&quot; the VCs are raising money from, and where did they get their money?  We always see a fresh-faced Mark Zuckerberg or Drew Houston, or a Paul Graham or even a Ron Conway, or John Doerr or Michael Moritz.

People think that &quot;getting stuck&quot; means they are poor at problem solving.

I am constantly solving my own problems.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for decades.  Still you put me in an interview and ask me to sort a linked list, and I&#x27;ll be spending %50 of my energy trying to get over the fact that the interviewer seems to expect me to just blurt out an answer.

5967671,comment,5966906,5967475,2,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Wine and beer in moderation is actually perfectly healthy.<p>The idea that moderate consumption of alcohol is &quot;perfectly healthy&quot; is actually quite debatable. Taking red wine as a an example because of the popular belief that it has notable health benefits when consumed in moderation, a few points:<p>1. Many of the studies on the supposed health benefits of red wine are inconclusive. For instance, we still can&#x27;t explain the French Paradox.<p>2. Last year, it came to light that a researcher who was behind some of the studies on the benefits of resveratrol falsified data.  A decent amount of the hype around red wine in recent years was centered on resveratrol and it&#x27;s important to note that even if there are benefits, the actual relationship between compounds like this and human health are in most cases not yet clearly established.<p>3. Red wine contains known carcinogens.<p>4. Even moderate consumption can add significant calories to one&#x27;s diet. For example, if you&#x27;re a male and drink two glasses (which is considered a moderate, &quot;healthy&quot; amount) three days a week, you&#x27;re adding nearly 3,000 calories to your monthly caloric intake. Depending on when and how you drink your wine, you might also consume more food because of wine&#x27;s impact on hormones associated with appetite. By the way, this is even worse in most cases for beer, where with some major brands, a single can or bottle a day can easily add 4,000+ calories over the course of a month.<p>5. Many of the potentially beneficial compounds in wine are available through other food sources that come with fewer drawbacks. In other words, you don&#x27;t need to drink a glass or two of red wine every day to get your antioxidants.<p>The bottom line: if you&#x27;re going to enjoy a glass or two of wine (or beer) with a meal, you shouldn&#x27;t justify it on the belief that it&#x27;s &quot;perfectly healthy&quot;.",1372633691

The American &quot;revolution&quot; was a deeply conservative one, mostly seeking a return to the status quo as it was before the British, drained by wars with France, started hitting up the colonies for money. Indeed, much of the American polity viewed the radicalism of the French Revolution with skepticism and distaste (at one point Thomas Paine was arrested in France and scheduled to be executed).",1372633603

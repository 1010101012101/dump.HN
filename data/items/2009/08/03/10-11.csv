While that's true, looking at the history, there's no reason to think the move away from multi-crop rotations to corn on corn on corn was done for any reason aside from short-term financial interests of farmers decades ago, and then a shit load of direct farm welfare since.<p>I haven't read Omnivores Dilemma tho I have read In Defense of Food.

738941,comment,737937,738628,0,0,yardie,,,"Wow, talk about missing the point. The point of university (or used to be before they turned into high priced vocational schools) is to teach you how to learn. If you didn't learn AI or computer music in school then what's stopping you from learning on your own. In fact, you could enroll at any university right now and take those electives as audits.<p>And the 14 credits you took to learn another language barely cover what is required to speak that language. So congratulations you have the same vocabulary as a 7 year old native speaker. The school did their part. They got you in the game. How you go about the rest is entirely up to you.",1249295533

738929,comment,738812,738856,0,0,wooby,,,"I have very fond memories of Radio Shack also.  It's where my dad bought the first family computer, a Tandy 486, when I was in elementary school.  The guy who sold it to us was friendly and knowledgeable.  I remember asking him how I might program the computer myself.  He said ""Try QuickBASIC, and make an effort to learn how to touch type.  It will pay off.""  It was some of the best programming advice I've ever gotten.<p>It seems like the ""hacker"" side of Radio Shack has fallen victim to the age of comparison shopping and online communication.  For me growing up in a small town, Radio Shack was the place to go for technical advice from very smart people.  And really, it was; Radio Shack was one of the few places where tech-savvy people could make money at a 9-5 with their skills and knowledge in just about every town in America.  It was an ubiquitous bastion of DIY and technological enlightenment.<p>The few times I've been to a store since childhood I've been less than impressed with both the salespeople and products.  It seemed like each time I was there, another drawer had disappeared from the electronic component rack.<p>So, whether they're changing the name or not, the real Radio Shack was gone a long time ago.",1249294591

They destroyed each and every bit of goodwill they ever had. I remember the kits they sold that taught kids the basics of electronics, all the 'notebooks' with simple circuits that you could build. I think plenty of people of a certain generation gained a lot from their interaction with that company, I also don't doubt that they all ended up being disillusioned by them.<p>Cost cutting and bad manufacturing + rude and pushy sales people will not make you friends in any industry.",1249294451

I guess that many of the people who read the Gawker story would not have been willing to invest the time to read the original article in depth. What value has Gawker added? They've sensationalized it slightly, and summarized the juicy bits. The originator of the story is actually in a perfect position to do the same and appeal to a different market - if they can stomach it.",1249294299

738914,comment,738812,738856,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Actually, that's very similar to my experiences with Radio Shack.  I was always treated very well by the Radio Shack folks, including when I was <i>really</i> young (like 10, or so) and would ride my bike over to browse around; a friend and I once went in with our allowance to buy parts to build a robot.  They were very helpful with LEDs, batteries, and other such things.<p>My negative experience was one specific incident, but it was particularly galling because I had always felt comfortable at Radio Shack, and like the folks working their weren't being condescending even when I <i>didn't</i> know anything.  I think Radio Shack started fading for me as a positive brand on that day.  The TRS-80 was already moribund by then (the Tandy 1000, fat keyboard model, was probably on display at that point), and I think the writing was already on the wall for Radio Shack...but the cell phones hadn't started showing up yet.<p>I thought it was interesting enough to bring up, because I'd never really thought about <i>why</i> I have such a low opinion of Radio Shack, and that one employee ~20 years ago is a big part of the story.  Sure, the phone sales guys are useless idiots, but I don't remember them vividly...they're just a wash of ""Oh, yeah, Radio Shack was a waste of time, and I ended up finding it at Fry's."" experiences.  It was the guy who treated me like a dumb kid that stands out.  It's also hard for me to recall any occasion <i>after</i> that on which I got useful assistance from a sales person at any Radio Shack.",1249293622

If you have the choice of making more from welfare, than from a job, picking the (hypothetical) better financial option is an incentive for you to stay poor? How&#x27;s that? If the alternative is to make less doing more work -- surely minimum wage is more of an &quot;incentive&quot; to stay poor?<p>(Lets not get into the discussion of &quot;rich&quot; welfare receivers and such, I&#x27;m just curious how you could see choosing the option to make more money as an incentive to stay poor, vs making less doing something else -- now if the person had the option to get a decent job, then that&#x27;d be diffrent?)",1381453078

6530927,comment,6521885,6525061,1,0,gwern,,,">  Your example isn&#x27;t remotely close to being analogous to the argument that was made. If you stick a thermometer in hot water, it is measuring the water&#x27;s temperature accurately. If an individual studies for a specific type of IQ test, that particular IQ test fails to accurately measure his general intelligence.<p>Yes, it is. IQ tests are designed to reliably measure intelligence under certain reasonable, but not adversarial or universal, conditions. Just like a reading off a thermometer is a reliable way of measuring body temperatures under certain reasonable, non-adversarial, non-universal conditions. Memorizing the answers or training by taking the test repeatedly is akin to a kid pretending to be sick and dunking the thermometer in his hot chocolate to get out of school. It&#x27;s still reporting something, but not what you think it is.<p>> The IQ test is generally accepted because there aren&#x27;t any practical applications where a near-perfect measurement of a person&#x27;s intelligence is going to be a matter of life and death,<p>Indeed. Your standard IQ test like a RAPM is not used in adversarial contexts (sadly, &#x27;publish or perish&#x27; increasingly means that research is an adversarial context as well), and failure to understand this seems to be leading to a lot of confusion in these comments. If you want to handle even adversarial contexts, you need a procedure <i>way</i> more complex & costly than a 10 minute pen and paper RAPM - you need something like a proctored SAT or GRE.<p>> The entire field of psychology is in its infancy, it is one of the least developed of all sciences. We are making quite a bit of progress, but there&#x27;s still a long way to go.<p>Intelligence and measuring it via IQ tests is some of the oldest and most conceptually & statistically deep and commonly-used parts of psychology, going back a century at this point, which is something few parts of psychology can claim. I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath waiting for psychology to abandon it because it&#x27;s in &#x27;its infancy&#x27; and &#x27;is one of the least developed of all sciences&#x27;. At this point, it&#x27;s roughly like expecting the spacing effect to go away.",1381452856

I mean, I <i>could</i> afford it, but I would be incredibly uncomfortable every month knowing that one missed week of pay meant a bill that wasn&#x27;t going to be met that month.<p>I did at one point rent a room from someone who was making $35k/yr who had just bought a $90k house and couldn&#x27;t make the payment. It wasn&#x27;t much cheaper than an apartment and the person made it clear almost every day that I was only welcome in the house because I paid more than half of his mortgage every month. He was an ass and I had no rental contract with him, so I left. His house got foreclosed upon a couple months later; I was going to buy it from the bank but he had trashed the entire inside and ripped out chunks of the exterior wall.

The whole thing smells like sour grapes.<p>Humans are the exception that proves the rule, just like efficient markets hypothesis does not mean that no one makes money on Wall Street - but the vanishing few people with the skills and knowledge make money. It is an observation that the base rate of successful improvement must be <i>extremely tiny</i>.<p>> All the people who lived before MDMA will never have that much fun. Evolution just didn&#x27;t hit the lucky path where humans are constantly tripping balls. Life isn&#x27;t fair.<p>To give the example I already gave in my essay, evolution may or may not have hit the lucky path, but if it did, because it disables perception of danger, the goofy lucky people would be quickly eliminated by Inspector Darwin.<p>> So what doesn&#x27;t it predict?<p>It predicts that if we discover a genuine improvement in intelligence, it will be complex, fitness-reducing, or tiny. This is a very strong and specific prediction which seems to be doing well.<p>> Is there some reason why you think that using drug therapies to drastically increase human general intelligence is an impossibility akin to water flowing uphill?<p>Water flowing uphill is not an impossibility: it is extremely unlikely. I chose my examples to be unlikely but not impossible - just like it is not impossible that someone will discover a way to majorly increase intelligence which is simple and without reproductive fitness penalties, it&#x27;s just incredibly unlikely.",1381452207

It could be lead to some interesting outcomes.<p>1.	Via Angellist syndicates it will be easier to raise up to $1 Million (maybe half). So you will have a bunch of companies that get funded via this super series/seed/angel model.<p>2.	Then they will hit a roadblock, they will not get any $10-$20 Million to fund growth or get a true product/market fit.<p>3.	The vast majority of the companies from step 1. will be wiped out because even if they have a hint of product/market fit, they will not get funding.<p>4.	The tiny minority from step 1. that can get funding for Series B. in the range of $50Million or more will wipe out all other startup in the category and capture all the gains.

In some countries, a person rich enough to have a house, a car and to qualify for bank loans for both is considered pretty well-to-do.<p>>>> A rich person can buy things in cash, and then self-insure using his assets to cover accidental losses.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure most people, not only poor people, use car insurance. It&#x27;s more convenient and usually (unless you drive exotic or super-expensive cars) cheaper than surety bonds that are usually required, and same with cash deposits (since cash deposited at DMV can&#x27;t be used for anything else). For businesses having massive fleets, OTOH, it may make sense to self-insure since they get the same risk distribution as insurers, but without the middleman.<p>>>> overall, being poor is a very bad business policy<p>It&#x27;s bad business, but you may have a lot of incentives for it, given that welfare subsidies and services you may get in many US localities pay more than minimum wage job and in some localities more than average wage job.<p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-get-welfare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-get-welfare</a>

The thing is that statistics that talk about &quot;rich getting richer&quot; makes you assume that same people that were rich 20 years ago got even richer now, and same people that were poor 20 years ago are even poorer now. In fact, nothing in this statistics point to it - what statistics can tell you is that some people were rich 20 years ago, and some different people are rich now, but it usually says nothing about how many of people rich today were rich or poor 20 years ago. It is completely normal for a person to be piss-poor while being a young student and become quite well established when retiring. Usually it comes from working hard and making a number of right choices on the way. Including, yes, saving diligently and having long-term view, which leverages the power of compound interest - but for this you need the right <i>behavior</i>.",1381451552

However, the only agency he failed to notify was in fact the only one with jurisdiction, the FAA. He seems hell-bent on being allowed to do whatever he wants to do, however reckless, which is going to cause long term harm to this industry and hobby.<p>I have a commercial-grade (several $k) multirotor designed for large cameras as well as two couple gopro-scale helis and fixed wing platforms, and I have to admit that based on some hardware failures (not pilot error, I can admit those) that I&#x27;ve experienced, I&#x27;ve gotten pretty leery of flying in some of the situations that people seem to want to use these most: sporting events, parades, concerts, weddings, etc. They simply aren&#x27;t that reliable yet, and beyond that pilot skill is highly variable. Just because you can scrape together $1k to buy or build a multirotor doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re fit to fly one anywhere near another human.<p>I&#x27;ve also flown full-scale aircraft, and while I tend to be suspicious of regulation, I do believe that some degree of oversight is necessary to do this safely, and that has been demonstrated in commercial aviation. Some type of demonstrated proficiency and equipment standards would go a long way towards making sure that this can be done safely. If we don&#x27;t do something like that, I&#x27;m afraid that a few bad incidents are going to make this something that could become entirely illegal at any kind of small scale (i.e. nothing smaller than a Predator fielded by a well-connected corporation), which would be a terrible loss.<p>Privacy is a whole different issue, and something that I think has been blown out of proportion in comparison to the safety aspects, which are my main concern...",1381451417

I mean that, as in, &quot;what good is it going to do to find the answer to this question&quot;?  Even IF it weren&#x27;t the case that the answer is probably different for every single individual, what would you do differently if there was a discrete answer and you knew it?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I spent a decade of my life (basically the 1990&#x27;s) dedicating hundreds of hours a month to being a volunteer firefighter.  I did everything from being a probie to being Fire Chief over the years, ran hundreds of calls, spend FSM knows how many hours in training, got my instructor certification to teach FFI and FFII, Incident Command, and LP Gas Firefighting classes...  and now I don&#x27;t do any of that anymore.<p>Why not?  I don&#x27;t know, my interests changed, my career took me in a different direction, and now I spend my time doing other things.  I don&#x27;t do much volunteering these days, other than a trivial amount of time working with the local mountain-bike club on building and maintaining trails.  My time is so precious to me, that I find I&#x27;d rather try to help charitable causes and other orgs that I believe in, by just donating money.  So now I make donations to, or maintain memberships in all sorts of groups: IMBA (International Mountain Bicycling Assocation), NRA, EFF, Libertarian Party, Gun Owners of America, FSF, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, Second Amendment Foundation, Grassroots NC, etc.<p>Outside of that, I feel like the best path for me to both accomplish my personal goals and to help make the world a better place, is by founding a startup and building an awesome company that can create jobs, and - once we&#x27;re profitable - do even more in terms of giving back to worthy causes.  Plus I simply feel driven to be engaged in the act of creating something, and right now that means trying to create this company.<p>But that&#x27;s just me... again, I expect everybody has their own take on things.",1381450223

6530806,comment,6529639,6530507,1,0,runamok,,,"The historical &quot;best practice&quot; max home loan ratio was 3x your gross income. However, that was at a time that interest rates were significantly higher. Therefore the amount you are paying now over the life of the loan is smaller and thus more manageable. This assumes you make a large enough down payment that you don&#x27;t need private mortgage insurance.<p>However, this presumes you will have 20-30 years of (more or less) uninterrupted prosperity which I think is unlikely.<p>People also do things like rent out a room or two to give themselves more of a cushion.<p>Here are some calculations using this site: <a href=""http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/</a><p>I assumed a loan of 250k, 30 years, with no property tax or PMI since this is just for comparison.<p>Right now rates are ~3.5% so over 30 years you would pay $404k and $1122/month.
Over the past 30 years the average interest rate has been 7.45% so over 30 years at that you would pay $626k and pay $1739/month.<p>So a very significant difference.",1381450038

For example, with so many things claim to be going to open source, if someone uses a 3d printer to make a screw to fix a car, and an accident occurs, what does it mean to the victim, insurance company, auto company and you?<p>Does open source actually innovate in areas like making cars? Does closed-source, private industry competition generate better innovation. Are there correlation and/or causation in either approach with new innovation? In other words, maybe it&#x27;s nice to open discuss ideas but does actual implementation matters if it weren&#x27;t open source? With software, we certainly have really terrible open source projects that people will use just because it&#x27;s handy (I am looking at you pycrypto), but in the end we have to build another one. Whereas proprietary software may include custom &quot;pycrypto&quot; library that has private cryptanalysis done on it. It is still safe and useful.",1381449978

However to go on a bit of a tangent what did people think of the sensor in the photo?
It&#x27;s interesting that such as small sensor still has long pads for connecting (presumably to program it and get data off) and also that it has a little tag on the left of the picture (making it bigger).
I can&#x27;t see a battery in the photo. Is it on the backside or is it powered in some other way?
Also what is the little metal wire for? I would think that it was an antenna, however they state that they had to find the birds again to get the data back so it would seem that they don&#x27;t communicate wireless. Could it be getting powered from radio waves instead?
What do you think? Is there more information on it somewhere?",1381449728

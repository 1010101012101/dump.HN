Even if they win they lose goodwill.<p>Prediction: out of court settlement, followed by decline in NetApp revenue and profitability.  Four years later NetApp is bought by or merges with another company.<p>StorageTek was formed in 1969 and started selling their disk systems in the mid-70s.  The company was started by former IBMers and they have over 600 patents.  Considering they were shipping a virtual disk and snapshots product 4 years before the NetApp patent was filed, prior art seems likely.",1189056756

I received advice once to not fully explain my ideas to a large corporation because they have the resources to develop it quickly and/or without me.  Who would you not tell your idea to and why?  Any horror stories of ""bad judgement""?",1189055883

50957,comment,50219,50840,0,0,steffon,,,"The examples you use as counter-arguments to my approach are not really counter-arguments, but deal with a different issue than what I was talking addressing in my last response.  I was talking about finding music based on personal preferences.  Your counter-examples of ""making out with my girl"" or dancing ""at a club"" are group situations where group preferences are most important.<p>You are right when you say that compilations like ""Ibiza Club"" or ""Ellington for Lovers"" make a lot of money:  so does selling Muzak (the background music in supermarkets and most commercial spaces with music).  Background music is the ultimate ""genre"" that is compatible with group preferences: no one is offended... but at the same time, nobody really cares.<p>I agree with you that musical preferences have more to them than ""people like you also like""... this would disregard the reality that people sometimes do categorize music by situation/mood,  categories like listening to music to dance, exercise, study, make-out, host cocktail parties etc.  <p>But as I suggested before, domain specific categories of music do not have to be mutually exclusive to personal preferences (currently they are).  Let's say your goal is to have romantic music.  Why not use a ""people like you also like"" function bounded by the category of romantic music?  This way you could get romantic music, i.e. music everyone thinks is romantic, and romantic music that you like as an individual.  Even better would be to use a ""people like you and your girlfriend also like"" function within the specific category of romantic music :) <p>""Also, with all the choice available, it's easy to overestimate people's desire to even HAVE choice.""  This is pretty fatalistic don't you think?  I think the explosion of choice online frustrates people because they KNOW something is out there that they will really love, but they can't FIND it.  This screams opportunity for a website to act as a choice agent to direct people to the music, video, merchandise etc. that they want but can't find themselves among the infinite choices.  Infinite choice results in infinite search costs without a decision agent.\n",1189055143

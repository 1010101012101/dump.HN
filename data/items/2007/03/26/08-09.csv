It is not possible to all that they just talk to everybody or they are very few frens but they are brilliant in creating the products, for such people VC funding and getting into their network is more usefull. And doing so you can get the pulse/need of the people and your ideas sharpens and you know you need to close the doors. \n",1174899082

Could be total bull, but certainly makes sense to someone who doesn't know much about the science behind the idea.<p>My totally useless guess is that as a baby you'd need the most sleep, and around early 20's things would start reversing the other direction. That seems like a pattern in other body functions.<p>Anyone less ignorant have some real information?",1174898737

6326,comment,6310,6310,0,0,lee,,,"Gee, hope not. It's 4:13 am and I'm just finishing up for the day. I'm 45 and my team is applying. I've worked for a ton of startups and have started a couple of my own. Both my parents had great capacity to outlast their age-peers and function without sleep, so I think there's a genetic aspect to this ability. I don't believe that the ability to stay up late should be the main criterion for choosing worthy startup material. It's a marathon, not a sprint. ",1174897504

6324,comment,6310,6315,0,0,staunch,,,"<i>""Is it too late guys?""</i><p>That's not a very ""founder-y"" type question. If you're relying on external approval and motivation you're going to have a hard time shouldering a startup. Fierce determination means not letting anything (including age or ""rules"") stop you. Joe Kraus is fond of saying: ""The beginning of the discussion is when someone says 'no' -- that's where the fun begins.""<p>Why don't you save up, build your startup prototype, get users loving it, and THEN give YC or a VC a call. There's nothing like hard evidence you have a clue to get someone's attention.<p>I'll be a bit harsh and suggest you might just be searching for an excuse why you can't do it.<p>By the way: PG and co. were around 30 when they did Viaweb.\n",1174897021
6323,comment,6310,6315,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nYou shouldn't be asking.  Suppose YC had an official ""don't trust nobody over 30"" policy.  Would that stop you? <p>Build it on the nights and weekends.  If you need to keep your day job, do so.  If you've never run a business before, start at least a small one.  You don't have to go whole hog in a bet the farm type situation... if your wife stays at home, a small home base business might just be the ticket (software or not...)  The reason I advise this is a business, any business, will put you thru the business school of hard knocks... and it might be easier to learn those lessons on a venture that has a lower risk of failure rate. <p>Despite the admonition against single founder businesses, there's nothing to stop you from building something on your own.  Don't wait for a co founder to show up (or build the lower risk business while you're waiting.) <p>I think finding a cofounder is like finding a wife- you can't order one thru the mail. <p>Your deterimination is a bigger factor than any of the pluses or negative you listed (well, and you can program.) <p>For what its worth, I'm 38, have been working for startups since 1991, started my first company (and online service that was also a franchise) in 1994, and sold it in 1997. That was my MBA. And for a programmer, dealmaking may seem weird or too ""social""... but doing it helps you develop a taste for it, and doing it in any form makes it easier. <p>So you absolutely, positively should start a business, any business.  I think you might be too late for YC this summer, so finish the year with a working prototype of a product... I'm sure that helps in your application for the next round of YC.  But if not that, start something. ",1174897000

Most evidence from people of various ages seems to indicate that your all-nighter capacity (a proxy for general age-variant startup capacity) only seriously falls off after late-30's early-40's, not early-30s. <p>By the way, the light-gray-on-white font in the comment field bugs me.

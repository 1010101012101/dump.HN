I can certainly relate to Marco&#x27;s and by reference Matt&#x27;s struggle.<p>Early on in life there is the ever present exchange &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Chuck I <foo>&quot; where <foo> is some tag, some referent, that hopefully is common with the person you are talking too and that sets up a series of linkages, defines behaviors and expectations, and can inform on conversations that may or may not be interesting. When I was in my mid twenties I realized I was saying by rote &quot;I&#x27;m an engineer.&quot; And that would then grease the conversation along.<p>But after a while I had things I did at work, and things I did as a hobby, and things I was interested in, and had a few awkward sort of exchanges that went something like &quot;Hi I&#x27;m Chuck, I&#x27;m an engineer&quot; ... various technical discussions ... &quot;what do you think of the hypothesis that petroleum is a biologic process?&quot; ... pause ... &quot;Uh, I thought you were an engineer.&quot;<p>Then once I realized the conversational rut I was in I started just cutting it off, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Chuck.&quot;<p>Now that is really funny around introverts since you leave them with no place to go. And a lot of folks I socialize with are fundamentally introverts. So that isn&#x27;t a good conversation starter. :-)<p>But once you realize its a conversation starter, not a definition of who you are, you can go back into discovery mode, like &quot;Hi I&#x27;m Chuck, I&#x27;m curious about that gizmo you&#x27;re carrying ...&quot; etc.<p>And you realize, as Marco and Matt have you want to know &quot;who&quot; you are.

Rather, that anyone seriously considering themselves a programmer should have an understanding of the design patterns that are pertinent to their language/methodology, and hopefully their own opinions on which make sense or not.<p>I likely have too high of a standard for the term programmer, but feel it has been steadily lowered by this type of talk and wanted to at least try to move the bar back up.",1373694100

As a Haskellite, I tend not to see the point, and wonder sometimes whether they&#x27;re all just kludges to, e.g., work around not having first class functions. I&#x27;ve actually written more Java than Haskell, and have taken a (not great) class on design patterns, so I&#x27;m aware of these concepts; I&#x27;m just yet to see the point.<p>Is there a good explanation of design patterns conducive to a &quot;functional&quot; programmer&#x27;s point of view? Most importantly, one that doesn&#x27;t motivate the <i>problem</i> in terms of objects?

A &quot;whistleblower&quot; is a term for someone who blows a whistle. This is generally meant to indicate someone who is making some kind of loud noise to report a crime; someone (maybe a cop, maybe just someone who is a victim of a crime) trying to get attention that a crime has been committed.<p>Now, when reporting a crime, do you generally expect the perpetrator of that crime to be the appropriate person to determine whether or not a crime has been committed, and thus whether or not labeling the person a &quot;whistleblower&quot; is appropriate?<p>The whole idea of whistleblower laws that don&#x27;t protect someone from reporting to the public about crimes committed by the administration is laughable. What the hell is the point of any kind of whistleblower laws or protection if you can&#x27;t actually blow the whistle on your bosses?",1373692623

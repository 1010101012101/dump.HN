I absolutely love this place. I love the energy, the intellect and all the ideas that are being thrown around. I've watched StartupSchool, I've read most if not all of PG's articles, and I'm constantly writing down ideas that come up in my head. This has all been happening since my senior year in high school. Then again, I know there is a big difference from doing all of these little things, and actually putting them into play and executing them. In fact, I think I should have already started something up regardless of the time constraints I have with tennis.<p>A little bit about myself... I'm a college student at one of the U.C. schools and I'm also on their tennis team. It's hard to balance school, tennis and fun-time but I like the intensity of my schedule, the exercise and everything that comes with being a college athlete.<p>Well, aside from that, I've always been into building things, especially things that involve competition\rankings. I want to have my own startup, at least eventually, or at least work for one before I graduate. I want to know what knowledge\insight\tips you guys can offer me and what I can do as a college student (aside from educating myself) to get myself ahead of the game. I really want to do this, and I'm willing to eat shit, throw away sleep, and make major sacrifices. I know I can.<p>Right now, I'm an undeclared freshman and I am about to declare either a major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. Would it be better if I majored in Comp Sci?

The function allows you to do simple search/replace on your current working directory and cd to the replaced version, all in one step. This is a built-in ksh feature, but easy enough to enable in bash. If you have directories with relatively deep nesting and very similar names (e.g. school/2009-2010/compsci1/grades versus school/2010-2011/compsci2/grades), it's a godsend.

The reason why email declined at all was because of an ubiquitous messaging platform for the masses, SMS, while email wasn't nearly so (reading web email on a mobile device a few years ago was a rarity).<p>As mobile technology evolves, the use case for SMS disappears.  Email apps become as ubiquitous on mobile devices as SMS apps.<p>And once that happens the ""immediacy"" advantage disappears.  Today it is just as fast for me to send a quick email as it is for me to send a SMS.  The speed is purely the software, where SMS was, in the past, the only one integrated with the phone contact list.<p>Now that your email and SMS accounts will tend toward having parity in the phone's software, I think the argument for 70 or 160 character limits disappears, especially on a phone (yes, people make the argument), where I'm already constrained by they keyboard and the fact that I'm usually on the go.  And especially since on a mobile device, I HATE having to refactor my message to get the last 7 letters to fit.<p>The rebirth and re-emergence of email... it will look like a better SMS.",1290957087

There can be quite a bit of overlap between a like-minded gaming community and Hacker News.<p>It may not be possible to accomplish all of the things you’ve got on HN while playing video games themselves. But it is when you have a chance to meet other creators that share a passion for this hobby and how can you have the passion to create if you don’t consume a little? I’ve met my share of talented creatives and entrepreneurs through my hobby, which have lead to business acquaintances, contract work and also hiring other ”losers” to help me create.<p>I assume you’ve done the same thing I’ve done through gaming, by having a genuine interest in startups/creating and sharing that interest with others here.",1290956946

I have a CS degree, but never ran into a company irrational enough to care about it either way.<p>As for whether dropping out of a CS degree is a good idea, that greatly depends, not least on your costs in time and money.<p>If you&#x27;re going to not get a degree the ideal way to do it would be to skip all of college and some or all of high school, which would give you back 6 to 8 of the best years of your life for self-study and getting moving on a career; that could be far more valuable than a degree. Conversely if you&#x27;ve gone nearly all the way through the system and are currently halfway through final year in college it would make no sense to drop out at this stage.<p>Money also matters. In America particularly, if college will entail crippling yourself with debt you will only be able to get out of by permanently emigrating, you&#x27;re probably better off just saying no. On the other hand if a high-status college offers you a full ride scholarship, it&#x27;s probably worth your while to take it.",1387639869

The PDF guide is simply too generic and vague - most non-technical users won&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s saying. But I can fully understand how difficult it is to make a convincing case. How do you explain these issues in a simple, digestable format that takes a minute or less to read? And let&#x27;s be honest, sometimes the open source version of a piece of software isn&#x27;t superior to a closed source one (in terms of capability or UX). Perhaps the focus should be more on issues (such as privacy, for example) and questions to ask when using a program or service i.e. make people aware of the issues and the choices available to them? Give users information so they can make informed choices, but respect the fact that many will still go with closed source solutions.<p>BTW, I wonder why ChromeOS isn&#x27;t on their list given that ChromeBooks will probably be a popular purchase during the holiday season. And I actually think in terms of arguing for or against an OS, ChromeOS is probably the easiest to argue persuasively against.<p>For example, you can tell people you can&#x27;t print to your desktop printer without an internet connection and that every time you print (even to your desktop printer), Google records that action. Some people won&#x27;t care, but others might not be happy with that. If you then go on to say that Google potentially [1] tracks and records your every action in the OS, you&#x27;ll be raising awareness of important privacy issues.<p>[1] I say potentially because Google doen&#x27;t reveal what they track and record in ChromeOS and that in itself is a question people should ask themselves when they use ChromeOS i.e. is it important for me to know what Google records of my online behaviour? Until Google reveal what they track and record, should I refrain from using their OS?",1387639846

If Katy Perry could be played legally, openly, freely, on a non-Apple equivalent (key word here is equivalent) music player, then of COURSE people would flock to the free, open device.<p>The unfortunate fact is however that we have the opposite situation, where for many free/open software/hardware options, the perception (if not the reality) is that the free/open options are in fact not as &quot;nice&quot;/convenient/easy/glittery/appealing to use as the for pay, closed systems.<p>The perception (if not the reality) is that the free/open options are lower in quality (quality of experience, if not quality of device/app itself) than the options being touted as evil.<p>The only way to change this situation is to change the perception, and/or change the reality. The big companies like Apple have enormous amounts of money, talent, and will, to dedicate towards marketing (influencing perception).

We quickly realized it wasn&#x27;t _quite_ that simple. For one thing we received a whole lot of money, some of which was literally dumped into a personal bank account by IndieGogo. My collaborator on this project, Kenn White, pointed out that we might very well have to pay taxes on this money if we didn&#x27;t do something to organize. That&#x27;s a huge waste of our money /and/ yours. Hence the formation of OCAP as a non-profit and creation of a separate bank account. This has taken us some time, but it&#x27;s worth it. It also requires that we keep track of donations and demonstrate that they were well spent, which is also a good thing.<p>I should point out that all this work is a royal pain in the butt, and we are not being paid to do this work. We&#x27;ve funded the filing fees out of our own donations.<p>Second, we wanted to establish a trustworthy board of technical advisors before we went and started spending the money. This has also been quite a bit of trouble, but it&#x27;s certainly been worthwhile. The full list will be up on our site shortly, but briefly it includes:<p>Bruce Schneier, Trevor Perrin, Marcia Hoffman, Moxie Marlinspike, Nate Lawson, Joseph Lorenzo Hall, Runa Sandvik, JP Aumasson and James Denaro. Thomas Ptacek has also been on this board, but decided to recuse himself while iSEC was being considered.<p>I realize this is a large set of advisors, and getting consensus does take some time: but at the end of the day this audit is all about trust. The goal here is to make sure that everybody feels it was run honestly and in public. These are people we trust to call BS if we cut corners or do something shady.<p>With respect to reviewing the code, I routinely come across bugs in open crypto projects that should have been detected by &#x27;people gawking at the code&#x27;. It turns out that in certain areas -- crypto being one -- you need a hell of a lot of domain expertise to find and kill subtle bugs. The people with that kind of expertise often have other things to do. This audit is an opportunity for us to correct that, at least this one time, for one project.<p>We hope it won&#x27;t be the last.",1387638360

My current main job is looking to add this ability into their application, and it seems obvious that we could use some the work that I&#x27;ve already done. It&#x27;s not anything that&#x27;s specifically tied to what our company does, it&#x27;s more of a general-purpose tool that anyone with an app could benefit from.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in charging anyone for anything, but I would like to retain the IP rights to my software. My employment contract is relatively lenient in this regard - anything done on my own time, with my own equipment, unrelated to our business I still have rights to.<p>Some questions I have:<p>1. What do I need to watch out for from an IP perspective? If using this means that I spend some work time working on it, would getting something in writing acknowledging that this is my IP be enough?<p>2. Has anyone done anything like this in the past? How was it receieved by your employer? I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that I&#x27;m planning on quitting and pursuing this anytime soon, and being labeled as a flight risk, but on the other hand I don&#x27;t want to throw away the rights to something I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on.",1387638229

While I think I could have reached a similar level of practical knowledge if I had taught myself, there are many aspects that I wouldn&#x27;t have even known about, or wanted to study, which have actually helped me become a better programmer. Even if on a day-to-day basis I don&#x27;t think about discrete mathematics, compilers, real-time systems, and other things that I&#x27;ve learnt during my degree, having an appreciation for them, and knowing the theory behind certain things helps me loads.<p>I remember tasking to a software developer who works in a startup, after dropping out of university in the first semester. He has loads of practical experience, has committed to big open source projects, so clearly knows his stuff. I told him how I thought it was funny that Perl&#x27;s regular expressions were actually Turing complete.<p>Everyone on my course who I&#x27;ve told this to has found it very amusing, and it really is quite funny if you know the computer science theory behind regular expressions, but this developer stared at me blankly, clearly not understanding it at all. I thought that was as shame, because although I don&#x27;t write regular expression engines every day, knowing about the differences between classes of languages has influenced my design decisions in software, security considerations, and more.<p>You don&#x27;t need a college degree to work as a developer, and that appears to be more and more true all the time. But it could take you many years to achieve the background knowledge, and you will need to put in a huge amount of effort to learn things yourself that you may find irrelevant or boring at the time, because the pay-off in practical application doesn&#x27;t come until much later.",1387638095

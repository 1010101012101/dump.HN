322493,comment,321997,322469,0,0,trevelyan,,,"This is not true. The bailout is a cash giveaway to people who should really be jailed, but it is also structured to avoid a massive drop in the value of the USD. The reason is simple: it is an attempt to exchange good debt (government debt) for bad debt (private debt).<p>If things were handled differently, the Fed would have to promote liquidity by increasing the money supply. They are scared to do this in part because rates are already low and they don't have much breathing room. Also out of fear that any increase in the US money supply will trigger a run on the dollar.<p>That would force the US to raise interest rates to attract the currency to cover its debt. The exchange of debt for debt is technically non-inflationary as it takes the same amount of paper assets out of private hands as it puts into them.",1223016269

They might pave some sort of a path.</i><p>The only problem with this idea is that it's dangerous.  The reputation of the Internet is that of a haven for pedo predators...you make a dating site for 14 year olds (or even allow them on your site) and you will bring down the wrath of every Sarah Palin-loving soccer mom in America (i.e. the really dumb ones, who believe it when Oprah tells them that pedophiles are organized, after their children, and have over 9000 penises).<p>Besides that, kids from high school through college <i>already</i> have tremendous dating-related interactions at school.  They're not short of new people to hit on and flirt with.  I just don't think it's a very good market to go after, even if it wasn't a death wish from a legal and political perspective.<p>But, it <i>should</i> be kept fun, distinctly non-sleazy, and light.

In real life, a glance, flushed cheeks and a smile tells you everything you need to know about basic attraction.  Online, there's the back and forth over bullshit like music and film and food (which all matters to long-term relationships...but without the spark, there won't be a long-term) before you ever even get to meeting the person face to face.

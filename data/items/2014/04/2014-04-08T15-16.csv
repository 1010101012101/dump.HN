7554186,comment,7552868,7554008,3,0,hueving,,,">My only point was that talking about one-time-pads as &quot;unbreakable&quot; encryption is not a useful discussion, since &quot;unbreakable&quot; and &quot;encryption&quot; need to be better defined.<p>No they don&#x27;t. You are receiving negative feedback because you are trying to adjust definitions that have been well-defined by the crypto community. When talking about the security of an encryption algorithm, the key distribution has absolutely nothing to do with it. Stop conflating the two.<p>>If we expand the definition of &quot;encryption scheme&quot; sufficiently to allow transmission of secrets outside of cryptographic channels, then OTP is not even close to the only unbreakable system.<p>Would you care to share with us some of these other unbreakable systems? Remember, the keys are the only thing that can be transmitted outside of the channel and they cannot be based on the information being encrypted.",1396972760

7554053,comment,7552631,7552631,22,0,joshvm,,,"Having used these services, here&#x27;s some advice/traps for young players:<p>1) Silkscreen isn&#x27;t that important unless you&#x27;re going into production - and are you really going to stiff your customers with crappy boards?  The only other place it might matter is if you&#x27;re dealing with particularly sensitive layouts where you don&#x27;t want gunge on your traces, but again - why are you using a $10 manufacturer?<p>2) Etch quality is normally fine with these boards, pushing the fab minimums is asking for trouble, but standard 6/8mil is never normally a problem.<p>3) Shipping is a lottery, sometimes stuff arrives very fast, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s just HK mail.<p>4) Drill quality is where you might start to get worried because if the holes are sloppy, you might end up with messed up vias or holes in traces where they shouldn&#x27;t be. (see <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/115"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/115</a>)  This is something that the cheaper houses tend to fall over on, but you can get round this by making the via rings larger to allow for their mistakes.<p>5) Panelising is an interesting case here, as someone mentioned.  DirtyPCB specifically mentions V-cuts in the fab specification so presumably they&#x27;re allowed.  There&#x27;s no good reason why any middle-man should prevent you from making a design if the fab wouldn&#x27;t make it for the same price.<p>6) Cost per board - there&#x27;s a fixed cost here which seems to imply that if possible and allowed, you should panelise your boards or at least put multiple copies into a single 5x5 or 10x10 shape.<p>If you want an alternative, look at OSHPark, <a href=""http://oshpark.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oshpark.com</a>.  They offer $1/sqin for 3 boards shipped anywhere - this scales to 9 boards for $12 so fairly similar to dirty PCB and often cheaper because often you only want one or two revisions of a prototype board.<p>The quality is excellent, you get ENIG (gold tinned) plating and they&#x27;re made in the US which should mean fast shipping.  For us in Europe, shipping is still a gamble.  For more advanced designs you can get 4 layer boards and there are cheaper options for large orders.  You can only get purple boards, which look cool, but aren&#x27;t for everyone.<p>Critically the price is per square inch rounded down to the hundredths or thousandths.  So if I want to make an LED breakout board that&#x27;s only 0.5 square inches, I only pay $0.50 for 3 (and I&#x27;ve done this).<p>There&#x27;s also BatchPCB, but as they lost my order and are no longer price competitive I&#x27;d have to say they&#x27;re not worth it any more.",1396971651

The log holds changes made to the database over time - so when you want to write a change to your DB, you put &#x27;I&#x27;m changing value x.y to 50&#x27; in your WAL.  Sometime later the actual data pages holding the modified x data structure can be written out to disk.  If you have a crash before the data pages get written out, you can &#x27;replay&#x27; your WAL file to redo all the lost changes.<p>Unfortunately, a central requirement of a write ahead log is that the data pages must not get written before the WAL.  If that were to occur, and there were a crash, the system wouldn&#x27;t know that it had to undo the changes to the data pages, leaving you with corrupt data.  mmap generally doesn&#x27;t provide the ability to pin your dirty pages in memory - they&#x27;re subject to getting flushed any time the system is under memory pressure - so it makes logging a lot more complicated to get right.",1396971593

Cayley&#x27;s theorem guarantees that every group is a subgroup of a symmetric group:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley&#x27;s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley&#x27;s_theorem</a><p>A symmetric group is then a subgroup of the general linear group in any field, where the general linear group GL(K, N) is the set of invertible NxN matrices with entries from a &quot;field&quot; (just think &quot;numbers&quot;) and therefore <i>any [finitely generated] group is isomorphic to a group of matrices under matrix multiplication</i>; this is the underlying concept of <i>representation theory</i>.<p>If we back up a little, a <i>group</i> is a very general sort of algebraic structure; many important concepts have an underlying group structure, such as rotations, permutations, and any sort of reversible computation. This latter case implies that matrix multiplication is Turing complete; the simplest such set of matrices is generated by the Toffoli gate matrix. The relationship of groups to geometry is due to the underlying correspondence between the axioms of a group and those of geometrical transformations. A set of reversible geometric transformations includes an identity element -- do nothing -- and obeys associativity (sorta complicated, but it makes sense if you think about it) and inverse operations (by assumption): this makes it a group, and it can be represented by matrices. If we remove &quot;reversible&quot;, we get exceptions -- like the cross product -- but these are usually related to groups (cross product -> quaternion algebra).<p>So matrix multiplication is actually really, really fundamental in a lot of mathematics. It&#x27;s also a special case of tensor contraction, which could justify another tower post (but won&#x27;t).<p>>And trust me, when you are writing numerical code, being able to read the mathematical formula clearly is essential, especially when you have a lot of formulas and need to figure out why your code is giving you numerical non-sense.<p>(spent three months chasing a bug where two commands were out of order)",1396971348

The UK passed a law in 1983 saying prisoners couldn&#x27;t vote. In 2001 someone mounted a legal challenge to it which was dismissed and arrived in Strasbourg later that year.<p>That court ruled in 2004 saying a blanket ban on prisoner voting was illegal, the UK appealed and lost in 2005. The government messed around before bringing a bill before parliament in 2009 to allow some voting rights - this bill was defeated.<p>And since then.... Nothing. 2014, 13 years after the original case was bought, 5 years after is was won and prisoners have no right to vote and the government have repeatedly stated they aren&#x27;t going to get the right to vote.<p>And the UK isn&#x27;t the only country where this happens - I can&#x27;t remember which but either France (I think) or Italy are notorious for ignoring EU court rulings where it doesn&#x27;t suit them.<p>EU Courts are great where the national governments feel inclined to do what they say or don&#x27;t feel too strongly about it but if they don&#x27;t want to do what the court says, quite simply they don&#x27;t.",1396969348

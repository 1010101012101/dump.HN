The company that hired me is paying for the move and movers to basically pack everything up and ship it off to my new location. I wanted to do some of the packing myself to hasten the overall moving day and also so I know where some of my things would be. Well it turns out, just packing a simple book shelf turned out to be much more time than I expected. I had all of these different ideas floating through my head - should I donate this book? Should I toss it? Should I give it to a friend? Is this even my book, did I borrow it? Is this packed &quot;correctly&quot; so that the movers would bless it off to meet their standards? Would they have to repack? Did I over pack this too much? So many different ideas and decisions. When the movers came in, they just had a single, simple mission - PACK EVERYTHING AND GET IT OUT. There was no decisions to be made, it all had to  move. I think this is a learning opportunity for me but I haven&#x27;t figured out how to utilize it yet.",1407988292

It used to be a small community.<p>I disagree with the original post that implies BeOS was better than NeXT. There are a lot of really useful, cool things in NeXT that are not appreciated by the masses and forgotten with time. All the new iOS developers don&#x27;t know how much history/heritage their stuff is built on.<p>For example, fat binaries are so incredibly useful and elegant. While Mac easily transitioned from PowerPC to Intel, then 32-bit to 64-bit, and now all all the different ARM architectures on iOS by using fat binaries, all the other platforms are a mess with just their 32-bit to 64-bit transition partly because the need to differentiate between two different architectures on the file system breaks most tool chains. (Not to mention that it confuses the hell out of users about which version they need to download.)<p>Linux had their chance with Icculus&#x27;s FatELF patch and they rejected it. Only years later after great suffering is some of the Linux community starting to think maybe FatELF was a good idea after all. Too bad our 64-bit migration is almost over. But Android still really could benefit from this because that system is a mess that looks like it will need to deal with multiple architectures indefinitely.",1407988035

Besides, I think I have essentially read about this already (automated cyberdefense with offensive capabilities), minus the codename or apparent connection to the Bluffdale facility.<p>I can understand the timing suspicions.  Frankly, I&#x27;m in the camp that tends to trust Snowden, but putting that aside, I think some discrepancies could at least be partially explained by one or more factors:<p>a) the journalist is putting some words in Snowden&#x27;s mouth about &quot;last straw&quot; or &quot;the time had come to act&quot;;<p>b) Snowden was still deciding what actions to take (yeah, he emailed Greenwald back then and was almost certainly going to share something, but may have been on the fence about how far to go);<p>c) Snowden has sort of unconsciously mentally revised the exact timeline -- I think this is not unusual for someone looking back on their &quot;life-changing moments&quot;, difficult decisions, months-long transformations etc.  Or, the quote about Clapper may have been Snowden using it as a microcosm for everything else that put him down the path he was already on (by contacting Greenwald.)  Maybe as it happened he saw it as vindication of the decision he&#x27;d already made.  Maybe he was going back and forth for months -- although he&#x27;d contacted Greenwald and started collecting documents, he had left open the option of turning back, but had his resolve renewed by &quot;the Clapper event.&quot;<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s fishy, but I don&#x27;t think there are any smoking guns per se.  It&#x27;s not like they quote Snowden as saying, &quot;After Clapper&#x27;s false testimony, I contacted Greenwald for the first time&quot; while Greenwald says it happened 6 months before.<p>Pro-NSA people say it&#x27;s not a fair debate because the government isn&#x27;t allowed to talk about the classified details.  That applies to Snowden too, because it&#x27;s difficult for him to communicate his side to the public, being filtered through journalists (who may be juggling his quotes around and mixing up the timeline for the sake of a better story) and not having many opportunities (or eschewing them, to avoid becoming the center of focus.)<p>I read an interesting and new (to me) statement of intense premeditation in &quot;There was one key area that remained out of his reach: the NSA’s aggressive cyberwarfare activity around the world. To get access to that last cache of secrets, Snowden landed a job as an infrastructure analyst with another giant NSA contractor, Booz Allen.&quot;  So he took a job specifically for the access it would afford him, with the specific intent to steal and leak?",1407987908

The problem is that you can&#x27;t evolve a product line by <i>removing</i> features. You&#x27;ve always got some feature or instruction that is the limiting factor for clock speed; some longest chain of gates that need to settle on the output value before the next cycle. You might be able to shorten that chain by breaking up an operation into several instructions or by reducing the number of registers or addressing modes, but that breaks compatibility. On the other hand, anything that can be added without lengthening the critical path and can be powered down when not in use is fair game.",1407987514

I made way to my desk, and marveled at this oddness, but didn&#x27;t say anything, until the test was passed out and I could tell it was a page of text, but, of course, the words disappeared upon inspection.

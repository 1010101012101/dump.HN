Not because people want you to use an inferior product, but because obviously one think that what he uses it the best. For example, as a current KeePass user, I&#x27;d suggest it.<p>Lastpass overall is comfy, you do everything within your browser, it sync without much problems and you can use it on the go with the official applications and addons. One downside is that everything is closed source. The other one is that I find their addon is trying to do too much, and it&#x27;s not polished enough (at least, their Firefox one). I&#x27;ve had tons of annoyances with it.<p>Keepass instead is awesome because it&#x27;s opensource and you own your data. But you can feel that not everything is nicely integrated. I use a Firefox addon (PassIFox) for filling username/password, and it works pretty nicely, but you have to set it up (and it&#x27;s kinda a pain to get it working on Linux). I use an application on Android (Keepass2Android) which has a different UX, and doesn&#x27;t have the fancy input method that the lastpass app has (instead you just copy/paste, and there is a keyboard for autofilling but I find it mostly annoying). The integrated sync support only ftp/webdav, and not everyone has a server providing those around (and I never got webdav to work anyway). Sure, you can sync the file with dropbox or other &quot;cloud&quot; solutions, but this implies even more software in your chain.<p>I never got to try OnePass sadly, as there&#x27;s no Linux version.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;d say: Try both, and see which one you prefer. Keepass is libre, and lastpass has a free tier, so you don&#x27;t have to put any money in it. Just use them for a bunch of sites for a bunch of days, and then decide.",1397090179

Pretty much anyone can start their very own Certificate Authority. The code isn&#x27;t that complicated (the specs are all available), the math is no longer patented so you don&#x27;t have to pay tributes to PKP. What you do have to do though is convince three people you&#x27;re trustable, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Google. If they add you to their trusted root certificate list then you&#x27;ve covered a whole <i>ton</i> of the market. I know of at least one &quot;private&quot; certificate authority which shares its ROOT CA with individuals who want to trust that the sites which have a cert from them is &quot;legit.&quot; (for some definition of legitimate).<p>2) <i>&quot;any state they are located in will just seize their keys ...&quot;</i> - this conflates two things, one is trust and one is seizure. If you live in the US, and have a PGP key that is trusted by the <i>target</i> of an investigation, and law enforcement can convince a judge that using that is the only way for them to get the proof they need, you may find yourself on the receiving end of a subpoena which demands you hand over access to your key. You can refuse of course, and the court can put you in jail for contempt. This issue is completely separate from the Certificate Tree or Web of Trust choice. The purpose of the <i>certificate</i> is to establish <i>trust</i> not <i>privacy</i>. The purpose of the TLS <i>protocol</i> (aka SSL) is to establish privacy. Its necessary (but not sufficient) to be able to trust the other end.<p>3) <i>&quot;... and read your traffic.&quot;</i> - Which is a violation of <i>privacy</i> relates to <i>how you established privacy</i> as opposed to the mechanisms in that protocol. And I suspect that you think that is a splitting semantic hairs but bear with me for a moment. The heartbeat bug is in OpenSSL, <i>not</i> the certificate infrastructure. There are lots of things that used different protocols, <i>and</i> X.509 certificates, that are just as secure today as they were before this bug was disclosed. The key here is that they used a different protocol.<p>The OPs rant might more properly be leveraged at what is effectively a mono-culture around OpenSSL, and I would agree that is a bad thing, but to not have that be the case you would have to have people <i>write their own TLS libraries.</i> And while that would assure that vulnerabilities were contained, it won&#x27;t happen because nobody can afford these days to hire a programmer to write TLS libraries that the only &#x27;hire&#x27; has been someone coding up some Javascript and CSS.<p>I can completely relate to the OP&#x27;s angst over the challenges of keeping things secure in today&#x27;s world, its something of a life we &quot;chose&quot; relative to using open source.",1397088008

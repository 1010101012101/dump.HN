Equity is given to compensate for the risk and work involved in a startup. Once the company is further along, the risk and work required are lower and there's no market justification to increase someone's equity stake. The temptation to ignore those promises is usually too great.",1314917862

But it is only one indicator, and people lie.<p>I believe that there is natural aptitude, there is experience, and finally there is motivation.<p>The age you started programming is most certainly an indicator for experience, and also I believe motivation. But it is only an indicator, not an accurate measure. If someone started programming at age 6, but didn't do anything with it till college, then they have less experience than a social outcast who came home from school every day and programmed to the detriment of homework. It would also suggest a lack of motivation.<p>Logically, the best programmer maximizes all three, but how does one measure them and how common is such a person?",1314917673

All of the provided collections have reasonable implementations of concatenation, so this implies you're inventing your own collection.<p>Everyone uses the alternate form: flatMap [B] (f: (A)  Traversable[B]): CC[B].  Nevertheless, I'll attempt to explain the provided signature.<p>If you understand Java generics, you should hopefully be able to understand this response.<p>A, B, and That are type parameters/generics.  So they can be filled in by any type.  This flatMap method exists on a trait (think Java Interface) called Traversable[A].  Traversable is similar to Iterable in java.<p>(f: (A)  Traversable[B]) means that this function takes one argument called f.  That argument is a closure or anonymous function.  The closure itself takes one argument of type A (an element in the parent Traversable[A]), and returns a Traversable[B], where B is an arbitrary type.<p>Skipping ahead, flatMap returns an instance of That.  But what's a That?  It appears to be unspecified.  This is where the ""(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[List[A], B, That])"" makes it's appearance.<p>Implicit parameters are like default arguments. ""def foo(i: Int = 12)"" will use the i if provided, else it will default to 12.  ""def foo(implicit i: Int)"" will take the i given, else it will grab the first available Int in the containing scope.  If you, ""val c = 11; def foo(implicit i: Int) = i * 2"", calling foo(1) yields 2, but calling foo() yields 22.<p>The object bf is an object that provides an overridable custom definition of concatenation.  So when you write your custom collection, you include an instance of CanBuildFrom[List[A], B, That] in the correct scope, and it gets used for the concatenation.  CanBuildFrom's type parameters say that it exists in a List[A], takes a B, and returns a That.<p>So yeah, in your implementation of bf, you could make it a new MyCanBuildFrom[List[A], B, FunkyCollection[B]], and do funky concatenation.<p>Hope that helps.",1314915684

But your math is loony tunes.<p>First off, he won't be on reduced salary for 4 years. Seed-round startups may pay below-market salaries, but with later rounds they typically bump people to market rates. The same applies to things like health insurance, 401k, and the like. He's betting maybe a year of reduced income.<p>Second, the notion of 3 months severance is... very generous. And unnecessary. At least here in San Francisco, the time between jobs for startup-loving engineers is approximately zero. (Or negative. We just hired somebody from a failed startup and would have been happy to bring her on board early if she needed to work part time to responsibly close out her last gig.)<p>Third, I'd call the career risk negative. In recruiting, I look for people with past startup experience, failed or not. And one shouldn't account for opportunity cost here. If he has a better opportunity, he should take it. If one comes up, he might; he's not chained to the desk or anything.<p>You're also ignoring time. It's not like the developer is putting in cash early on as founders and investors do; his contribution comes gradually, and he can quit at any time. Seed money buys much more equity than A or B round money, and for good reason: the risk declines over time.<p>Developers should definitely negotiate, but only with a clear idea of the negotiating landscape, including how the funding structure of typical startups looks. The should also some notion of the marketplace. If a developer wants 20% of the company when somebody as good will do it for 2%, then they're going to be out no matter what math they use to justify their demands.",1314915567

2952019,comment,2951347,2951906,6,0,danielsoneg,,,"Yeah, but nobody listens to 15M tracks. They listen to a small subset of those tracks, and that subset differs from person to person.<p>Heck, for fun, let's say you were to listen to music 8 hours a day every day for a month (~30 days) -<p><pre><code>  8hrs * 30 days = 240hrs\n  (240hrs * 60min/hr) / 3min/song = 4800 songs.\n</code></pre>\nBasically, you're paying $5-10 for a maximum of 4800 songs - or, between $.001 and $.002 per track, if you listen constantly.<p>Or, from the other side:\nSpotify's premium is $10/mo, which comes with no ads. They pay $.003 out to each band - let's just pretend they follow Amazon's 'agency' policy of a 70/30 split, so Spotify's making roughly $.001 on each song, and it's costing them $.004 total for that song (hypothetical - just stick with me). If we assume they're not losing money, then an average $10/mo user must listen to at most 2500 songs per month, and if Spotify's costs are higher than $.001 per track, the number goes down.<p>Point is, the industry's providing _ACCESS_ to 15M tracks, but they're only having to deliver ~2500/mo - but that's a different bundle of 2500 songs for each user. It MAY make sense from their end just to call it 'unlimited' and rely on the fact that the user can't consume music fast enough to really upset the economics for them.<p>(Incidentally, if you were to decide to listen to each of those 15M songs once, you'd wind up paying:<p><pre><code>  15,000,000 Songs * 3min/song = 45,000,000 min\n  45,000,000 min = 750000 hrs = 31250 days ~= 1027 months\n  1027 months * 10/mo = $10,270\n</code></pre>\nThe record labels, then, value their entire collection of music at $10,270 - if you only listen once!)",1314914981

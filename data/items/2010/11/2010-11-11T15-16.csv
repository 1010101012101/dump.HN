The reason why is because, through in-app purchases, a developer has the potential to realize a lot more revenue per user.<p>If all you're trying to do is to get someone to upgrade from lite to full, that can only happen once.  In-app purchases can happen several times.  In Restaurant Story (one of the games mentioned in the article), you buy gems to speed up the process with which you make food.  I'd bet that most people who purchase those gems do it more than once, because they're directly tied in to your success at that game.  In short, there's the potential here for recurring revenue.<p>Not only that, but the prices on in-app purchases can be startling!  Going back to Restaurant Story, I think the smallest batch of gems you can buy is $5 and it goes all the way to $99.  That's a lot more revenue per user, potentially, than on an upgrade from lite to full.",1289489703

Why?  Because Guido seems to not get functional programming.  Ruby copies Smalltalk but Katz says Smalltalk ""goes to far"".  What?

CLOS, the most powerful OO system in existence [1] and it was initially just a library on the language.  When people say things like this about perl they're usually talking from '98 or so when perl <i>was</i> the most flexible game in town.  A <i>lot</i> has changed since then.<p>>You'll get more library and language capabilities with CPAN than using anything else I know of.<p>Java has more libraries, hands down.

It's a purer implementation of what you'll be doing with Objective C so it will help you learn good behaviors when you are ready to do some iOS programming.  The Smalltalk image is also a fascinating concept.<p>[1] If you disagree, point me to one that is more powerful.  And the way I'm judging power is by how many patterns I have to know to use it.  In CLOS I don't even have to override a function and then call the base version, I can just use :before/:after methods.<p>[2]  This is probably Lisp's nicest feature that hasn't yet been copied by mainstream languages.

There is a great tutorial for getting an ASP.NET project going in F#.<p>I'd say the primary thing that you need to learn for F# is how to convert loops to recursive functions and vice-versa. Also, look into the pipe operator, and figure out how to abuse the hell out of Seq.reduce and Seq.scan.<p>If you like LINQ and lambda's in C# you'll probably like F#, I'd say that's what really got me interested, I ended up loving LINQ and lambdas and wanted to know more about this whole F# deal. Using the pipe operator makes the whole thing look much more pretty IMHO.<p><pre><code>  [0..10]

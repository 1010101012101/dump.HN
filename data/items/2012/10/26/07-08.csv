But, for a more ironic take on the issue, please read 'Player Piano' by Vonnegut.<p>Regarding your second point, I addressed this in the other post, but post-scarcity economics seems to be the best 'thought experiment' as to what a future society would look like.  I truly believe that we are entering an age where human labor will become obsolete.  It may take a while but, its going to happen.",1351238341

4701286,comment,4700542,4700542,11,0,viviantan,,,"It's rare to see successive and extensive news coverage of corruption among major Chinese Communist Party leaders, and there's been 3 this year already: Bo Xilai in March, Xi Jinping in June, and now Wen Jiabao.<p>This year's unusual because 7 major members of the Politburo Standing Committee are stepping down and their replacements will be selected at the18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. This is the reason the dueling political factions are aggressively ousting eachother, or else stories about corruption would never have made it to major media outlets.<p>The Congress was originally scheduled to commence November 4th (or sometime just before the US presidential elections) but was suddenly changed to November 8th. I don't think there's been official commentary on the last minute date change, but it's pretty obvious the Chinese party leaders want to know who's going to be the next US president first so they could ""adjust"" the makeup of of the Chinese political body accordingly.<p>I'm impressed by Bloomberg's and NYT's coverage. There's so much stuff that gets suppressed, even when tidbits of stories go viral on Weibo, the entire story almost never makes it over to this side of the Atlantic in one piece.",1351238294

4701282,comment,4700160,4700699,0,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"I'd respectfully submit that if your wife is writing a novel with actual line break characters at the end of each visual line, rather than only at the end of paragraphs, she's kind of an edge case. ""Normal people"" who have been using word processors since the late 70s have had it drilled into their head that <i>you only hit return at the end of a paragraph.</i><p>It's my suspicion that Markdown was written the way it was solely to handle the case of blockquotes having "">"" characters at the start of each line, and the reason that mattered is because BBEdit and Mailsmith had commands to wrap text that way, chiefly for quoting mail messages. This happens to fit in very nicely with the way Vim and Emacs wrap paragraphs, and I know there are people who've written novels in both. But I assure you that the <i>vast majority of fiction writers</i> are used to word processors, and for that matter, so are the vast majority of users typing things into text boxes. And if those users wrote a little poem<p><pre><code>  That had lines\n  Which looked like this\n  And failed to rhyme\n  Because they weren't really poets\n</code></pre>\n...the chances are they would just hit return at the end of every line, because that is the way <i>every program they have used in their entire lives</i> works. This is why GitHub and StackOverflow made that change: because Markdown is <i>not</i> like HTML to most people. It's like plain text. In plain text, when you press return it means ""end of paragraph."" The way Markdown does it -- and the way Hacker News does it, I just discovered! -- violates the principle of least surprise. I am not writing HTML, I am writing text, and I expect it to act like text.<p>(For what it's worth, I've written a collection of short stories in Markdown and created the EPUB from that using my own Python scripts to do so. <i>I am an edge case.</i> Anyone who is writing fiction in a text editor instead of a word processor is <i>also</i> an edge case. Sorry, but it's the truth.)",1351238195

No protection is perfect, but you're a lot less likely to be totally wiped out with a diversified portfolio. 100% of my wealth is in company A, and it goes bankrupt, I have nothing. If I have it in two companies, unless they are perfectly interdependent, I lower my likelihood of being completely wiped out from 100% to <100%. Concentrating wealth in a single company increases the variance in your outcome, which is something most people consider bad in financial planning.

You may see similar issues with virtualization disk images, although that will depend on how much writing you do.  I still do this, but don't do much writing and performance is acceptable.<p>The other part is fsync calls.  Doing a package install on Debian/Ubuntu is an absolute blizzard of fsync calls, several per file.  Kernel 3.5 is better than 3.2 and supposedly 3.7 will be even better again.  There is also the 'eatmydata' LD_PRELOAD wrapper which nulls out the fsync calls.  It was worthwhile using on 3.2, and with 3.5 I don't bother.<p>That is write issues.

I'd encourage the creator (dcurtis) to push it, because currently it feels like a first-stage idea  or perhaps, an execution without an idea at all.<p>There are many questions  ""What is Markdown?"", for starters  that feel unaddressed by the mark. Instead, we get the brute force approach: splitting up the word into smaller word parts, which is what you do with a word if you don't know what it means, or you have to gesture it in Charades.<p>Rather uninspiring for an idea so beautiful that Jeff and others can get so excited just thinking about it, but what else can you expect from such a mark whose approach is so stubbornly literal? I take that back  only one word part actually gets to be represented literally... the other only managed to become a letter, in a moment I can only imagine involved the creator muttering ""good enough"". He must have found this mark uninspiring as well, given that he sought to put a box around it.<p>At least consider that the down arrow on its own is an overloaded concept, particularly on the web. Without context  and a mark should not need context  M could read like a hotkey or command of some kind. This kind of ambiguity is utterly unnecessary  you're making a mark; it can be whatever you want it to be. Push!",1351236522

The executive summary of my answer: light markup is used in places other than text areas on Web sites.<p>Many of us use Markdown to keep formatted text in, and, ultimately, to generate valid html markup from. Markdown is <i>not</i> just for textareas in Web pages. Whole books have been marked up in markdown.<p>Markdown files are just text files with 'explicit' markup within them and so will always be accessible/editable/processable in the future. Markdown is 'flexible' in the sense that it allows alternative markup for the same output, and is 'light' in the sense that a limited range of styling and block formats are available. Compare that with LaTeX which shifts with each tex-live release, and which means that markup written some years ago may not format without hand editing on a modern LaTeX release.<p>There is the reference implementation available from Gruber's site, and, as others have mentioned, pandoc implements markdown in a way that can be extended. I'm dubious of the need for an 'official' specification; I rather like the scrappy streetwise nature of Markdown.",1351235147

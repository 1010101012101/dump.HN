2190699,comment,2186392,2188776,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"The first line of my above comment, when viewed in the comments section of my profile came to 216 characters.  That is with two sidebars of whitespace each taking up 10% of the horizontal width.  I have neither an especially large monitor, nor an especially small font.  In fact, I have the font cranked up slightly from the norm in order to avoid eyestrain. (Ironically, when I copy and paste said first line into a word processor, at that font size it fits significantly less than 80 characters per line, which goes to show just how that 216 should be considered an understatement of the horizontal screen real estate available for most people)<p>In a corporate environment, it is not unreasonable to assume that the developer can have a second monitor.  Sometimes you have to <i>gasp</i> be nice to someone in order to get it, but that is not too onerous.  Hence I believe your view is outdated; in practice horizontal is much cheaper than vertical.<p>When printing, one should probably do a few things in order to improve the appearance on paper anyway.  Examples - you might want to set the indentation depth a little less than normal, say 2 spaces.  You should also twiddle the font until it looks good, or is good for purpose (there are different reasons to print out code) and you might want to concatenate several smaller classes onto a single page, or remove the 20 line header of corporate pseudo-legalese from the top of each class, or even remove the imports, or not print the getters and setters.  In other words, unless your purpose is to murder trees, you will likely hand-tune the printing to optimise it, <i>at which time</i> you might choose to set an 80 column width - if you felt that having each page consist mostly of a thin column of text pressed up against the right hand side of the page was the most aesthetically pleasing thing.<p>----<p>Run over lines do look a little bit ugly when printed I admit, this is true.  However, since code is viewed 10-100x more often on screen than on paper, I believe it is inefficient to prioritise for printing (in a cart before the horse sense).  Moreover, since the choice is between a <i>little</i> bit of ugliness when printed (inifinitely many chars per line) compared to a <i>lot</i> of ugliness when viewed on screen (80 char limit causing frequent line breaks, which are themselves heavily indented, which makes the run on itself more likely to spawn a run on), I prefer the lesser of two evils.",1297112228

I've done a CS degree (admittedly at a crap school), an MBA and am about to finish a law degree (at a non-crap school) and none of these bear direct relevance to what's out in the field. Indeed, part of the reason I put myself through the agony of so much higher ed is to gain experience thinking in different paradigms, not merely so that I can now write an algorithmic description of the rule against perpetuities.<p>With that in mind, and having written code for both startups and large companies, I don't think that CS programs are generally all that much like the real world in either situation (unless of course you're talking about somewhere like PARC). You're absolutely correct that learning to ""build cool stuff"" is pretty important, but I think it's equally important for larger companies, so I'd say that's more of criticism of CS in general than a failure to prepare people for startups.",1297112046

Simon spent about year (~1993) following and interviewing the people who lived on a specific drug corner in Baltimore; one of those he followed was a high-school-age kid whose description is much like this teacher's description of M.W.<p>There's also an HBO miniseries based on it (which I haven't watched, so I can't vouch), and Season 4 of The Wire is partially about a Baltimore inner-city school (The Wire is fantastic). Simon also spent a year embedded with the Baltimore police homicide division, which became a book, a TV serial (called Homicide), and informed much of The Wire.<p>Some people are commenting that the solution to the problems at these schools is to completely give up on the troublemakers; I don't think it would be that clear-cut for you after you read or watch these. The kids you give up on are the ones lost to the hardcore drug culture forever. Those same kids are the ones that perpetuate the problem- there's a terrible feedback loop going on.",1297111603

Right now a lot of parents treat school as daycare for their kids, they don't care what happens there as long as the kids aren't at home.</i><p>Absolutely agreed. There's very little that a school can do for a kid if the parents don't care what the kid does at school. I'm not sure the solution needs to involve expulsions, but parents definitely need to have a greater responsibility in their children's education. You can't just drop your kid off at school and mind your own business.<p>If greater parental involvement in education means that one of the parents can't have a full time job and save money for college, so be it.

If they disrupt, they're kicked out of class for the day, since attendance at that class is a voluntary association.<p>To get credit and a grade for a class, you have to complete X homework assignments and pass Y amount of tests.<p>If a kid decides they wants to hang out all day in the cafeteria, good for them.  Teachers might want to check in on them and see why or offer books or computer access to do some self-education.<p>You'd also want to diversify the classes if possible.  Add classes in video game design, automotive engineering, etc.  Make these classes enticing, and <i>hard</i>.  Rope the kids in to hard classes by making them seem like blow-offs.<p>But most of all, let the kid choose to learn, and you have a lot more power over the kids who come in just to disrupt.

There are many factors, but at the very least before you start contacting media outlets you need to be super-clear on 2 things:\n1. Your target audience - be as specific as possible. You say that your service is regarding home-safety. Does this require a significant $$ or time investment on the part of a homeowner to install and manage? Do you have to own your home to be able to take advantage of it?  Does this appeal to more affluent people? With children? etc.  Get very specific. You can then see how your target intersects with the demo of specific media outlets.\n2. Purpose of your PR.  what do you want to get out of this announcement? Do you need funding? Do you want to attract actual end users?  Do you want to create buzz so that retailers will contact you to carry your product? These goals require extremely different tactics and usually very different media outlets.  In general, end user acquisition for a mass market product is rarely accomplished from PR unless you get into NY Times/ USA Today/ Oprah.

Here is why.<p>Most large companies have department budgets, project budgets etc and are usually sensible enough not a pay $250 for a huge team of developers etc. Most of the time, they hire a couple of devs at that rate. And usually when they bring in contractors, these contractors work with an existing team of in-house developers, project leads, PM's. Very rarely, they bring in a whole team of consultants/developers to run the whole show within the company.

But I do think they should not be allowed to disrupt the education of others.<p>There are some intereting alternative schools that may be a way to tackle the issue.  It's not an easy problem.<p>With that said, I think what this essay addresses, while seemingly obvious, is one of the biggest problems we face, and education reform generally doesn't mention it.<p>And I do speculate it hides one of the reasons why places like Promise Academy do so well.  The students, even from broken homes, who go there are strongly pushed by mothers (or grandmothers) that this is special place.  The expectation of good behavior is much higher there.",1297110260

Why? Because narrowness reduces the back-and-forth scanning our eyes must do as we read—reading is easier when our eyes work less. Reading is also easier when what we’ve just read and what we’re about to read are both within our visual range. Research shows that as our eyes change focus from word to word, our brains can take cues from surrounding, unfocused shapes. The more our brains can glean “advance warning” from shapes within the visual periphery, the better they’re able to direct our eyes for maximum comprehension.</i><p><i>Research also seems to show that, when it comes to line lengths of text, there’s a difference between reading speed and reading comprehension. Longer lines can be read faster, but shorter lines are easier to comprehend.</i><p><i>Certainly we need code to be understandable when we read the source files directly. We also need the code to be understandable when we encounter it in diffs, merges, patches, debuggers, code inspections, compiler messages, and a variety of other contexts and tools. […]</i><p><i>When working on code that changes as often as DiffMerge (it has been changed 175 times since it was first written), programmers spend considerable time looking at it in diff and merge tools. What these tools have in common is that they restrict the horizontal view of source files, and they add a certain amount of clutter of their own. Code like DiffMerge’s is readable even in these conditions. In command-line diffs, its lines don’t wrap. In graphical diff tools, we don’t have to fiddle with the horizontal scroll bar to see the bulk of its lines, […]</i>",1297108870

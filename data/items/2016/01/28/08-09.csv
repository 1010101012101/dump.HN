Here is my hypothesis:<p>We are living in a high-speed economy. The paper business cards provide static engagement. So modern business men / women want a more dynamic branding and marketing tool to enable vibrant mutually beneficial partnerships that take full advantage of internal and external synergies by sharing up-to-date information with each other, referring each other based on a face-to-face meeting initialized visually creative digital business cards.<p>Does it make sense? What is your opinion? Would you buy a product like this?",1453971580

First of all since HP has so many different laptops, finding a store that actually carries a particular HP laptop is very tricky so it&#x27;s basically impossible to get a hands on look at the laptop before buying.  Then it turns out that HP doesn&#x27;t sell the Xbook 2788Q in my country, they sell the (visually similar) 2789P instead.  Are there any major differences?  Is the reviews for the 2788P relevant?

Poor People only cares about a few things, whether they have enough money left this month, How long will these savings last them to pay for food and rent.<p>There are 3 things that is what I think should be needs of basic income, Clothes, Food, Housing.<p>Clothes are commodities these days, you can get all the clothes you need for a tiny amount of money. As long as you dont care about fashion. What needs to be done here is clothing for extreme weather, namely Cold weather.<p>Food, at one point in my life i spend average less then $2 USD per day on food. For nearly 12 months. People here claiming their Basic Income should cover their meal for McDonald or other outgoing dinning. ( May be in US only ) But that is not the point, real poor would care about savings. You can buy your food in bulk for extremely cheap prices, pasta or spaghetti, then get some Hams or Vegetable. As long as you go to supermarket and watch your pennies, there is no reason why you cant feed yourself for less then a Fiver a day. You just have to cook it yourself. Nutrients being another problem on $2, you should get by ok with $5.<p>Even without such thing as basic income, it is not hard to see as long as you get a Job today, as a hard working labor intensive job or part time, you can can enough for clothes and food and not worry about starving to deaths.<p>The problem then, lies down to Housing. Renting leaves you with the feeling you may get kicked out any day, and you will spend hopeless amount of hours trying to find a place that fits your budget. I suggest anyone who has never been through living on the streets to watch the &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; by Will Smith. Although most people would had an different ending then the movie. Rent also cost you the largest percentage amount of your income. Where you can save a lot on Clothing and Food, there is no such thing as saving on Rent. Food and Clothes as commodities, it happens the most expensive out of the three is not a commodities but instead an Monopoly.<p>For Example what is the point of having $1000 basic income when $800 of it goes to Rent? And rental prices is being driven up by lots of factors.<p>Therefore as long as Housing market remains an investment asset, susceptible of being driven up by insane amount. ( Think about Rent in 2008 and now ), it will remain an unsolvable problem no matter how you price the Basic Income. Germany and some other European countries has rule to protect tenants from rent price hike. Some even take % of Housing Market profit as tax on top of the tax in place.<p>Government needs to provide basic housing, small even 15-20 meter square will do, with basic such as hot water, electricity and Internet ( Soon to be a basic need ), at rate that <i>relate</i>\nto their basic income percentage.  And a promise they wont be kicked out unless they do things silly.<p>And if all these are too government related, we need technology to built public housing cheaply, and efficiently in short space of time. And open up the cost structure to let people know they are not being ripped off. Property market is an monopoly that derails much of our society.",1453969366

The rules of economics detects that fat margins are not protectable over long run. Eventually competitors will meet minimum bar and start eating away your market share. That is exactly what&#x27;s happening. The iPhone sales are on declining trajectory and iPad sales are already 25% down. Tablet market is actually booming but people are just buying cheaper ones that are good enough instead of twice expensive and better than good enough. The market for luxury goods have never been large and often ends up becoming niche.<p>Your assertion about brand dilution and attention to detail are incorrect. Good brands have been able to scale historically. GE - in their heydays - was worshipped for its ability to deliver countless appliances designed with very high quality, innovations and care. HP in its heyday had 100s of products known for its innovation and quality. Microsoft in its heyday had dozens of products that were either in top or close second in their category. Pepsi Co currently produces 100s of products under different brand names, many of them huge market leaders. Google has dozens of products (Email, maps, news, book search, scholar, docs etc etc) - all of which are pretty high quality and either in top or close.<p>Eventually companies don&#x27;t sell product, they sell their philosophy and culture. Only anti-fragile way for long term survival is ability to scale and embed this philosophy without single braking point and by creating a long tail.<p>Apple&#x27;s strength is to apply design to make superior products. They need to scale this strength to work on every aspect of life instead of just 3 devices. You should also read Talib&#x27;s book on anti-fragility. Apple&#x27;s (and Jobs) strategy is anti-thesis of that philosophy. Businesses are rewarded because others can&#x27;t copy them easily.

If you look at the &quot;expert systems&quot; literature, specifically older expert systems based on logic programming, there usually was an &quot;explanation component&quot; in the general architecture.<p>However I think this area has been under-researched but is obviously important. It would enable very strong learning environments and man/computer hybrid systems. I think there&#x27;s very direct relevance in safety/security critical systems and there&#x27;s some literature in operators not understanding what is going on in complex systems and how that can be fatal (think power plants and the like)",1453968403

Maybe they don&#x27;t want to reveal their secrets to inhibit competition, but in medicine you have to prove the thing works before you actually use the thing.<p>I don&#x27;t much care if they want to hide some aspects of how their process works, but under no circumstances should anyone in this space operate without conclusively, publicly and openly proving that the technology works. The standard for that is scientific publication, and the ability of disinterested parties to test the equipment and verify it does what it claims to do.<p>Plenty of medical/biotech/diagnostics companies have cleared that bar while maintaining trade secrets. Theranos should be submitted to the same standards, and as far as I can tell, whenever they have been tested, they have failed.",1453968085

Personally though, unit testing and test first development help me focus on a small problem and solving that, while ignoring the rest of the system. It's really easy to get pulled into the big picture. I also found my code to be  more modular and decoupled.",1211550893

198006,comment,197938,198002,0,0,far33d,,,"Pixar success is all about the confluence of it's three major players.<p>1) Ed Catmull - He was the founder with the original vision and great technical skills. He also brings a humility to Pixar, hired only the smartest and best people, and knew that the art should drive the technology, not the other way around. I believe his biggest contribution was knowing he couldn't build Pixar by himself.<p>2) John Lasseter. Creative visionary. Pushed the tech people  hard to think outside their comfort zones and find solutions to complicated problems. Without him, Pixar would be a dead software/hardware company.<p>3) Steve Jobs. Brought the cash. Let John and Ed do their thing. Managed the business relationships almost perfectly, negotiating the original deals w/ Disney, keeping Pixar insulated through some awful Eisner years, and, in my eyes, created the studio in the mold of a Silicon Valley company. He was also indispensable. He always gave just the right amount of push-back. Hopefully, Bob Iger can manage this as well as Steve did.",1211550174

If you read those unauthorized biographies of Steve Jobs, you will know besides Steve's financial backing, most of his management ideas were not adopted by Pixar and Steve Jobs yielded because he knew he's not good in that area. Steve's permanent obsession was making great computers when he bought Pixar from George Lucas. Most operation inside Pixars has been always run by Ed Catmull and John Lasseter and they basically do the way they want to get things done.<p>But nobody can denied Steve Jobs unconditional financial support during Pixar and Next's low point.

Having been an entrepreneur for the past fifteen years, I believe this is the best time for startups since we now have the luxury to bootstrap (until there is a workable business model) and also the ability to build business around off-the-shelf technology.  Startup failure is sort of an old topic on this forum but my humble opinion is that there is never too much information.",1211549782

However, the original poster wanted info specifically about linux, and while a BSD UNIX is similar, there are enough differences that productivity ...""</i><p>The poster also mentioned inexperience then requests a less secure server OS than what is possible.  Productivity may indeed suffer. Would it be a better idea would be to get an experienced sys-admin to look over the server and secure it?<p><i>""... I think it is a bit misleading to say that a distro like debian ""opens all doors"", that is not the case ...""</i><p>Of all the distro's debian is probably the better of the bunch to work with. Debian can be secured. But the strength of Linux and debian, its openness is also its weakness. Default installed distributions still install more applications than you need. This can leave the potential of an unwanted application running to be exploited. Debian before Ubuntu was also the hardest to configure hardware.<p><i>""... One must acknowledge however that this was a serious security problem on debian's side and in contrast OpenBSD has had _two_ exploits in _ten_ years. Those are some pretty sterling security credentials for OpenBSD ...""</i><p>When it comes to security I'd take OBSD over any linux distro for the simple reason the source has been audited. It is secure by default (You have to actively install what you require ~ <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/security.html</a> ). You will not be let down core applications with holes. Having said that I balk at upgrades.<p><i>""...

Better to go to the gym and use a machine that isolates the excercise to the exact muscles you want while not straining unrelated muscles and joints in evil ways.",1220047033

In my limited experience it's the hand rolled applications that are and out hand and unstable.  A major advantage of a good framework is that it does force you to stick to it's conventions which typically follow best practices.<p>As for the barrier of entry I found that learning a framework is like learning a new programming language to a certain extent and to really take full advantage of the framework you need to know the underlying language as well.  It seems the barrier of entry is actually raised by frameworks.",1220046741

This is probably the best solution to the broken intranet sites issue anyone could have come up with.<p>And the whining about the icon is truly ridiculous.

290457,comment,290352,290403,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's a balance thing.  A lot of startup founders get into bad habits--all-nighters because they've just <i>gotta</i> launch that new feature (which they rush into production, it breaks everything, and then they have to stay up even longer to roll it back, or fix the problems), eating nothing but ramen and cheap takeout, because they imagine cooking takes too long (though I've found making simple meals at home is more time-effective, generally), etc.  Everything takes a back seat to working, which I think is counter-productive.  You can't sustain that kind of thing, and when you burn out, you'll burn out hard.  If you don't sell the company within the ""candle at both ends"" phase (however long you can maintain that), you'll hit a brick wall and slow to a crawl for a while (you'll also probably look back on your code and wonder WTF you were thinking).<p>In short, I agree.  You probably should view having your own company as an opportunity to live right, rather than an excuse to live terribly.  Maximizing health and happiness is probably not a bad way to work towards success, as long as ""happiness"" does not involve lots of vacations and living beyond your (probably very limited) means.",1220045053

290449,comment,290342,290342,0,0,gleb,,,"Well, of course, standard venture model option grant percentages do not make sense in case of a small exit ($50M) which takes 4 years.  They are designed for an exit of 5 to 10 times the size.  So, if you are setting up an options pool, you should account for target exit size and time.  Incidentally, the interests of full salary employees with stock options are much more closely aligned with those of VCs than founders.<p>In Silicon Valley as an experienced engineer working for a startup you should be getting about $150k/year + stock options.  Some startups will have good exits.  Expected total return per year is about $300k/year long term.  But you are forced to save 1/2 of your compensation, and get tax advantages -- both good.  And you get to play the become-really-rich-on-stock-options lottery.  If you are hiring engineers here the packages should somehow be competitive with that.",1220044061

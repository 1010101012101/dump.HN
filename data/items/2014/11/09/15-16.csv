Initially I was using BitBucket but after having used GitHub I eventually opted to pay more on GitHub. There are two major factors for this. First the UI for GitHub is extremely polished. It&#x27;s a hands-down winner. BitBucket has always felt aged and clunky in looks and operation.<p>The second reason is the tie in to open source which makes it very easy to fork open source projects on GH, and then include them in your projects. Again, the network and activity graphs, the commit log, diff/blame/pull-request features etc, just make this whole aspect a lot more fun to use.<p>I suspect the only reason BitBucket is surviving is because of their differentiated pricing model.

8580045,comment,8576936,8579112,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"> APIs on the other hand, are mainly for humans to communicate with each other when building systems that interoperate.<p>I guess maybe that&#x27;d be the argument. To me, it seems pretty clear that API&#x27;s are for &quot;computer systems interoperating with each other&quot;.  That&#x27;s what an API is, an interface for one piece of software to interoperate with another. Seems to me and many others anyway. &quot;Interface&quot; kind of means &quot;interoperation&quot;, an interface is the where and how of one component interoperating with another.  I&#x27;m a bit surprised that any programmer would disagree actually, but I&#x27;ve been surprised before.<p>The scary thing is that non-technical judges will have to understand what an API is and what it&#x27;s for here.<p>I do agree that software code does some weird things to copyright and starts to make the whole thing odd, and agree with you about &quot;method of operation&quot; thing -- the trick about code, different from former &quot;creative expression fixed in a physical medium&quot;, is that code _does things_, in a way different from previous forms of creative expression fixed in a physical medium. Copyright is a weird edifice to begin with, and code makes it weirder, for sure.<p>> APIs are no different from any other code.<p>To me, API&#x27;s are _not code_ at all, sot that&#x27;s why they are different from &quot;any other code.&quot; An API is a _description of code_, not code itself. Code implementing an API is surely copyrightable, but it seems to me clear that an API -- the description of classes, methods, and signatures -- is not code, it is a description of features of code. Google here lost by making code that _worked the same_ as Sun&#x27;s, not because they copied Sun&#x27;s Java source. And that&#x27;s why it seems clear to me that it ought not, consistent with previous copyright law, to be copyrightable.<p>But clearly people will disagree, especially non technical people, which is why this is a case.

Clearly not copryightable in US law, really.<p>Pharmaceutical companies typically use patent, not copyright. The one place pharmaceutical companies try to use copyright is in &quot;product information documents&quot; (not the pharmaceuticals themselves), and even that is tenuous, as some courts have considered them statements of fact that are not copyrightable, and there was actually specific legislation about pharmaceutical product information sheets recently, which I don&#x27;t know the details of well enough to speak on.",1415546431

I worked with someone who was a bit too controversial, another too attached to the business model, believing things will turn around.<p>All I can say is: Know your founders. I&#x27;d go far as to focus on their personal situation, like their risk tolerance, their &quot;philosophy&quot;, their personal attachments, etc. The goal for a company is not to save the world, but to make money for you and your partners. If any personal attachment  can get in the way, like &quot;saving the world&quot;, or &quot;keeping control of the company&quot;, it will.

Attacks based on a large volume of traffic will always work if the service is centralised, since that&#x27;s where all the traffic will (eventually) go. The only real solution I see is to make hidden services highly distributed so that the load is spread out and largely masked by other traffic.<p>Somewhat related: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux</a>",1415545987

I can&#x27;t think of a single case where a forum maintainer would say &quot;gosh, I need a better <i>community building tool</i>&quot; rather than &quot;I think I need a better forum&quot;. Then, say, he lands on your page and the first thing he sees is a bunch of ugly stylized mugshots, whereby what he&#x27;s looking for is a single beautiful screenshot of a forum page... I mean it may sound like a minor, subjective thing, but the first impression lasts and I&#x27;m willing to bet that it had an extreme negative effect on your bounce rate.

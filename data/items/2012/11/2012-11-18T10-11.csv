I understand licensing will be an issue with the major labels but Google could take a bottoms up approach. Before Myspace collapse, it was on top of the social network world. Developing software on the web for indie musicians helped Myspace get to the top. Soon majority of independent musicians and their fans were using myspace. When Myspace become a popular place for discovering music the major labels all did deals with Myspace. If Google made effective cross promotion/sales tools with lyrics search for indies, I believe the majors will follow",1353235711

I'm used to getting just about a day of use on my Galaxy Nexus (that's taking it off of the charger around 8AM or 9AM, and putting it back on around 2AM). Some days it doesn't quite make it that long, depending on my workload. The Nexus 4 fared much better. At the time of this writing, I've had it off of its charger for 10 hours and 30 minutes and it's still got 45 percent battery life.

Lots of companies grow fast and then abruptly stop growing. You just substituted one metric in for ""success"" and didn't say that's what you did.<p>Second, the list is based on self-submitted reports (scroll down to ""Selection and Qualifying Criteria"") -- ""Deloitte has not audited the ranking ... Some companies that may be eligible to appear in the ranking are not included because they did not submit the required information or otherwise declined to participate"".<p>Third, it doesn't deal with failures, which is <i>more interesting</i> because that is <i>the default condition</i>.<p>Fourth, it's restricted to North American companies only.<p>Fifth, how did you define ""founder""? That seems to me to still be a slippery wildcard in this whole discussion.<p>Take Ryan Carson's case. He owns most of the equity. Is he the sole founder? If ""founder"" is based on legal control, yes. What about the day-to-day? He says he has an employee who is a de-facto co-leader. Are they a founder? Maybe not. What if they'd been there right from the start?

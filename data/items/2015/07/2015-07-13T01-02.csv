Heck, there&#x27;s entire sub-sector of vacation home rentals (HomeAway, VayCayHero) that has publicly traded companies operating in it.<p>The problem with two-side marketplace is the trust. Bait-and-switch and similar scams have plagued marketplaces like CraigsList. You arrive at a place, and it&#x27;s not what the photos look like. You make a reservation, and are told at the last minute that it got &quot;flooded&quot; a night before, and now the host gives you an option to switch to an inferior place or pay up more for a better-looking option. You arrive and find out the place is not for rent, and the photos have been taken by some scammer who thrives on taking small deposits and just repurposes same photos across multiple sites.

Instead, enforcing thread-safety should involve the use of concurrency constructs.<p>And, that&#x27;s the thing: OOP represents a stateful paradigm, in the sense that operations may be performed which mutate the state of an object. When we bring out the Hammer of Immutability to prevent potential concurrency issues, we are basically saying that we no longer want to be OO because of an unrelated requirement. Let&#x27;s turn the objects into structs that can only be passed around and copied so we don&#x27;t accidentally screw something up. This, rather than using the language&#x27;s actual concurrency constructs to safely share data.<p>><i>it is easy to end up with runtime errors when the environment of your project shifts</i><p>I can&#x27;t remember when this has happened to me and I&#x27;m genuinely having trouble seeing the case. If I have an object which suddenly must be shared across another thread, then I generally cease to access it on the initial thread without some sort of synchronization.<p>So, I just don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d suddenly share data across threads under any model without very careful consideration of what&#x27;s being shared and why. What operations will be performed with the data as input, what will be the output, and how/when do we communicate this to other threads?<p>Once you&#x27;ve done that analysis, then you have a blueprint for how to safely share data the right way.",1436751860

This wouldn&#x27;t require any optical splitting gear, so that might make things a bit cheaper.<p>For reference, the overall construction costs for Australia&#x27;s FTTH rollout was somewhere around AUD$1000 - AUD$2000 / premises -- probably toward the high end of that scale, but the order of magnitude is right. This would underestimate the cost for a semi-rural area. In Australia&#x27;s project they use fixed wireless / satellite for some areas where FTTx was not cost-effective.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the maximum optical path distance -- from memory this is probably somewhere around the 20km mark from the exchange, probably a bit less, will depend upon the technology used.

As our only option is to monitor new and prospective recruits, we&#x27;ll have to monitor people who aren&#x27;t yet committing any crimes. As we&#x27;ll be monitoring the widest part of the recruitment funnel, monitoring huge numbers of innocent people is just the only option.<p>* People might be recruited through channels we&#x27;re not already aware of. When a terrorist is recruited we need to be able to find out how they were recruited, so we can find new channels we need to monitor. And it could be months or even years between the recruit learning to use effective encryption and them being identified as a terrorist. So we need to store an internet history for every person for several years.<p>* Privacy? Well, there will be strict legislative safeguards in place of course! Unfortunately all the work will be top secret so only insiders can audit compliance and it&#x27;ll be illegal for them to take any evidence of wrongdoing to the press.

9875881,comment,9875549,9875549,0,0,ilamont,,,"This is terrible news. My sincere condolences to his family.<p>Five years ago, I read (and saved) a series of fascinating interviews about the development of the Wii. Some of them were on the Nintendo corporate sites (see <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20100612175931/http://wii.nintendo-europe.com/163.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20100612175931/http://wii.ninten...</a>) while others were from Japanese magazines that a colleague translated. It was really a remarkable tale — Iwata was a CEO who loved to work with his engineers and designers, and in the case of the Wii, they created something that was truly innovative, and not just in an engineering sense. The following excerpt discusses the creation of the Wii remote/nunchuck:<p><i>Iwata: I still remember the first time I saw the pointer demo in one of the conference rooms. From the moment I picked it up, it just felt right. I had handled other pointer devices before, but they are not normally responsive and leave you feeling more frustrated than relaxed. The pointer idea itself was also good, but in this case it was the sense of control, the finish of the product, that was particularly good. I suppose that was the result of the technology brought in by Mr Takeda.<p>Ashida: Well, it was because the main controller was just a rod. (laughs) It clearly couldn&#x27;t be used to control existing games. Since Wii is compatible with GameCube games, and we also had the concept of the Virtual Console, we had to make it possible to play games from the NES days, too. On top of that, we also had to consider FPS (first person shooter) games for the overseas market. These factors ultimately gave birth to the idea of combining various controllers to the main controller with an extension connector.<p>Miyamoto: The idea of connecting controllers spread very quickly, but the Nunchuk, which had such a strong impact when it was announced, was done much later.<p>Ashida: I first heard about the idea for the Nunchuk from Takeda-san. He said, “can you try to make something like this?” There were also requests from the development teams for Metroid and other software titles asking for a new kind of controller that uses both hands, that can offer a new type of gameplay.  And so, yet again, we started out by moulding another clay model. (laughs)<p>Takeda: This idea originally came from one of the young developers involved in the project I mentioned earlier, the one aimed at selling packaged peripherals with GameCube games.<p>Iwata: I can still vividly recall the look of anxiety on Mr Ashida&#x27;s face when he showed me the Nunchuk. What was running through your mind at that time?<p>Ashida: Well, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit well with the streamlined designs of the console and controller. At first, I also considered a design similar to that of the remote. But since it was so obvious that the right and left hands are used differently, I realized that making the designs similar would just make it harder to control. When I asked for Mr Takeda&#x27;s advice, he reassured me that it was fine for them to be different since they would be used separately.<p>Ikeda: we used to call the Wii Remote the Core Controller, or alternatively the Core Unit, because peripherals were attached to its extension connecter.<p>Miyamoto: Oh, that&#x27;s right, we called it the Core, didn&#x27;t we? But the term Core Unit doesn&#x27;t sound very accessible, even though that&#x27;s what we were aiming for all along! (laughs) It was Mr Iwata who insisted that the main controller be called a remote, wasn&#x27;t it?<p>Iwata: Yes, that was something that I was unusually stubborn about. The TV remote is something always sits within reach and is picked up and used by everyone all the time. Since I wanted the controller to be used in the same way, and since it ended up looking like one in the end, I strongly believed that it should be called a remote. And also because one of the most fundamental questions behind Wii&#x27;s development was why some people use the TV remote all the time, but hesitate to pick up a game controller. So I really insisted that it be called a remote.<p>Ikeda: n the early stages of development we ran into a number of problems that we hadn&#x27;t anticipated, like the fact that the controller would react to fluorescent light, for example. Creating a mechanism that prevents the controller from responding to fluorescent light and sunlight may not sound overly difficult, but it still caused us a good deal of trouble.<p>Iwata: So, that&#x27;s how the specifications of the Wii controller were decided. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the Tokyo Game Show last year that it was unveiled to the general public. I was up on stage at that event, and I still vividly remember the silence that followed the video that introduced the controller. It felt like time was standing still... It was as though the audience didn&#x27;t know how to react. Given that you&#x27;d all worked so hard on the controller, what did you think of that reaction?<p>Miyamoto: Like Mr Takeda, I too was very much on edge. I was certain that they wouldn&#x27;t understand Wii unless they actually tried it out for themselves, and so I was unsure how convincing the presentation alone would be. Everyone was clapping, but I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder whether our message had gotten across, or whether people thought it was too unconventional. However, looking at the other unveilings at the Tokyo Game Show that day, I was very much relieved by the fact that Nintendo was the only one doing something new. Everyone else seemed to be just polishing up something that everyone had already seen before.<p>Ashida, when asked about reax from developers: For the most part, their feedback was very positive, which was a great relief. Needless to say, there were a few cries of dissent, but most people were left with a favourable impression.<p>Ikeda: I was often left in charge of explaining the controller&#x27;s functions, but it was only when they actually got their hands on the controller that their faces would light up. Seeing this, I really felt as though we&#x27;d scored a hit. And then, immediately after they had a go on Wii, they started coming up with ideas. Right there and then they were already discussing what they could do and how they could do it! I was amazed by the speed of this.<p>Iwata: Producers are more likely to pick up the controller and start thinking about its limitations. Creators, on the other hand, are more likely to look at what is possible, come up with ideas and ask a lot of questions. They&#x27;ll go home with smiles on their faces, won&#x27;t they?<p>Iwata: In bringing Wii to the world, we&#x27;ve filled up countless boxes with mock-ups, prototypes, trial software, and so on. But I truly feel that none of our efforts were wasted. These concepts came and went at a remarkable pace, until we came across those special technologies that solved all of our problems at once. Nowadays, nobody has any doubts about the &quot;d-pad with two main buttons&quot; interface. But twenty years ago many people wondered whether such a controller could really be used to play games. So, if we continue to do what we know has to be done, our controller, which now appears quite unusual, may very well become the new standard. As someone who has made it their life’s work to make innovative products, I feel very lucky to have had the chance to witness this story from beginning to end. Everyone, thank you very much.</i><p>Japanese companies are sometimes portrayed as being too conservative. However, I have found that there is a creative/innovative streak in certain firms that can lead to truly innovative products that push the engineering and creative envelopes, open up new markets, and force everyone to realize new possibilities. Satoru Iwata deserves much credit for what happened at Nintendo.",1436751151

9875857,comment,9873756,9873756,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The thing that gets me in all these discussions is people acting like we can&#x27;t build a protection mechanism that stops A from getting in but not B. Yet, these same people in another context say we can using words such as VPN, port-knocking, TLS, SSH, and so on. We do it all the time with some solutions being quite strong. If anything, a robustly-designed R.A.T. or escrow is nowhere near as threatening than the average app or network protocol on endpoint: practically backdoor generators in practice and their 0-days are the main way High Strength Attackers hit targets.<p>So, first we should stop with the double standard. There exist mechanisms that work well enough in practice which allow selective access to systems (aka front-door). There&#x27;s also decent work in limiting such access, auditing it, escrowing, and so on. NSA also already does the escrow for its Type 1 encryption products with all key material managed and protected by their EKMS system [1]. If it got visibly breached, we&#x27;d probably have seen evidence of it. So, I&#x27;ll skip straight to the other issues that popped up in peer review when I published a few attempts at a secure solution to the L.I. problem.<p>Will it have security problems in general? Yes. Damage can be limited in a number of ways, esp if scheme is decentralized. Yet, it adds risk on top of what we already given even rigorously-built solutions have had issues.<p>Will there be authentication forgeries for LEO requests? Yes. This might be a one-off, quickly detected thing. It might be unlimited depending on how the breach goes. Sender and receiver must be protected across the board. LEO&#x27;s track record isn&#x27;t good. High risk here.<p>Does the government have a history of abusing its access and deceiving about its usage? Yes. A <i>great reason</i> not to do L.I.<p>Will the government agree to a L.I. scheme with a strong foundation for security that ensures <i>read-only</i> access for a limited period and can&#x27;t subvert system? Clive Robinson suggests that even a theoretically, bulletproof L.I. system won&#x27;t be acceptable if it limits them and it will be forced to be more &quot;flexible&quot; by their sway over courts/lawmakers. Seems true given current situation.<p>Can they prevent attacks via malicious sys-admins or infiltrators? Snowden says no and with quite the credibility. ;) High risk here.<p>And the big one: will the KEYMAT-holder survive the inevitable attacks of all intelligence services, hackers, and organized crime combined? And all the things they will do to the organization <i>or its employees</i>? Gravely, high risk here.<p>Dirk Praet brought up the last question in a discussion where I had tried to cover every single angle in design, personnel, and ops. In the end, Dirk and Clive are right: the government will force the system to have too much privilege, centralization, and/or accessibility; data will be mass compromised in a free-for-all by the opponents. Whatever concrete requirements come out of such legislation will present vastly higher risk than with key escrow or remote administration tools in general.<p>So, there&#x27;s extremely high risk in warrant process, key storage even with HSM&#x27;s, and organizations administering this even at SAP security level. More risk than any DOD, NSA, or FBI have faced before given the concentration of enemy effort that will occur. Their track record on smaller things shows they can&#x27;t handle something that big. Even if they were honest as Boy Scouts, the risk assessment argues against the L.I. option 100% and regardless of what level of INFOSEC our mechanisms ensure.<p>Also, if they were Boy Scouts, they couldn&#x27;t think like the attackers enough to stop them. Proposal is untrustworthy whether they are or not. That&#x27;s No^2. ;)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Key_Management_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Key_Management_Syst...</a>",1436750701

Start with Skeptic magazine&#x27;s Michael Shermer &quot;holocaust debate&quot; with Mark Weber (available on Youtube) for a civilized discussion, based on documents, among intellectually honest people. If you want something to read regarding revisionist arguments, I can recommend Arthur Butz&#x27;s PDF book (a fellow computer scientist) available online. For the mainstream arguments I recommend the relevant parts of Hilberg and Arad and then Pressac&#x27;s books on gas chamber operations. This will equip the student with enough knowledge to be able to talk about the subject intelligently.<p>This was the only safe way I could find of starting this research since a lot of material online seems hell-bent on blaming Jews for everything. I never understood this spurious connection. I don&#x27;t hate anyone, and I was curious to know how exactly millions of people could have been killed in such a systematic way. So I started looking for material without the hatred and it does exist, but it leads down a deep rabbit hole with very few certainties. Gas chambers are one of the hardest problems for historians to explain and the most prominent researcher in this area, Jean-Claude Pressac, has switched between mainstream and revisionism a few times because of that. That much should entice the potential student.<p>Near-unanimity among academics happens when there is great political pressure. Even the Pope&#x27;s political enemies in the 13th century conceded to his altered version of 4th century history (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine</a>) that was used as a device to support the Pope&#x27;s political authority. Today, Israel needs a similar political authority, and as Norman Finkelstein argues, it finds such authority in the mainstream holocaust narrative. Hence the political pressure against progress in this field, and hence the laws against discussing it in Europe.",1436750475

If that&#x27;s all it was, I wouldn&#x27;t bring the concern up; it&#x27;d be banal.<p>The problem is that startup investing is nothing at all like investing in public company stocks.<p>Venture capitalists don&#x27;t back a single company. The majority of startups fail. Pushing all your chips in on a single startup is like going all in on a queen high hand. Instead, VCs invest in whole portfolios of companies.<p>But that&#x27;s not the only difference. Because most companies fail, there&#x27;s a theme to VC investment theses. And it&#x27;s not obvious, because it drives founders (who are atypically savvy about startups) batshit. It&#x27;s this: the winners have to pay for the losers. A decent shot at a 2x return sounds like a no-brainer, but it isn&#x27;t. The returns on the wins have to be so good that they make up for all the failures.<p>Then there&#x27;s dealflow. Good VCs get <i>preferred access to the good startups</i>. Most startups that raise money --- and all the startups that fit the &quot;win will pay for other losers&quot; mold --- plan on taking more money. If your first round is low 7 figures, your second round is going to be 8 figures, and probably not crowd-based! If you know you&#x27;re going back to PE/VC for money, you care about who take money from this time. So if you can take money from Sequoia, you do. Sequoia gets the best deals, and crowd-funders get adversely selected into crappier deals.<p>Most VC funds lose money. Those are funds whose investments come with control --- something no crowdfunding investor gets. They can fire the CEO. They get bespoke due diligence, not to mention the VC&#x27;s network of other firms to syndicate with on future investments. And when they close a deal, they tend to get preferences built in. Despite all those advantages, they still lose money. Crowd-investors get none of those things. Why would they do better?<p>This is before we get into how comically subordinate common shareholders of private companies are. Startups routinely do things that would generate shareholder lawsuits in public companies. They get to do those things because they are taking money from people who know the game. Consenting adults. The crowdfunding public can&#x27;t do that.<p>And finally, why do we grant the premise that normal people are capable of selecting startups to invest in? They&#x27;re not even able to do that with public companies. In 2015, companies listed on the major stock markets have proven an ability to drive revenue. We know where their money comes from. Venture capitalists have to prognosticate about that. How are normal people supposed to compete with them?<p>It&#x27;s just a bad idea.",1436749243

  Tax fraud investigators spent a number of weeks on 
  nightclub parking lots in Athens and noted down the
  registration numbers of luxury sedans. Their  
  investigation revealed that approximately 6,000 car 
  owners have vehicles worth €100,000, but only reported

The less dense an area, the fewer potential customers you can &quot;pass&quot; by installing a new fibre cable down a street. Not all premises that you pass with a cable will want to sign up and pay for a fibre plan.<p>Construction can be made dramatically cheaper if it is possible to re-use existing infrastructure. This is important, as if you are laying underground fibre then the cost of digging new trenches (~AUD$100/m) is a huge component of the total construction cost. For example, when installing underground fibre, if there is existing underground duct with capacity that can be used then it is far cheaper to re-use that (~AUD$20/m) than digging new trenches. Similarly, if there are existing poles that can be rented then installing aerial cables (~AUD$30/m) is cheaper than digging trenches, but more expensive than using existing underground duct [1].<p>Another way to re-use existing infrastructure to reduce construction cost is to make use of existing cable, such as copper lines or HFC, instead of laying fibre over the full path from the exchange to the premises. The quality/speed of the connection will not be as good as a pure fibre connection, particularly if the existing infrastructure is old/degraded. These approaches are now being favoured in Australia&#x27;s national broadband project [2].<p>[1] note that in the U.S. labour costs are lower than in Australia, so don&#x27;t take these cost-per metre estimates too seriously. These costs exclude the cost of the fibre itself, which is typically a few dollars per metre.<p>[2] personally I think it is short-sighted to embark on a major infrastructure project and then try to save money by avoiding building the new infrastructure, and instead re-use the existing degraded infrastructure. These decisions were hugely influenced by political factors after a change of federal government, i.e., the old plan was necessarily bad and needed changing because the previous government started it.",1436749223

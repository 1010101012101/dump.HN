We're not just a huge binary cloud, in other words. And nobody's entirely certain just <i>how</i> we work.<p>Comparing us to computers is really ignoring most of the limitations of computers, and invites far to simplistic - and inaccurate - a comparison.",1233582991

(Note, this comparison will require knowing what engineers know.  If, for example, you say ""selling equity"", you must describe what you know about that that we don't.)<p>I'm particularly suspicious wrt strategy.  Why the assumption that you know the customers better than engineers?  Doesn't that depend on the customers, the engineers, and the business folk?<p>> management in general<p>Sorry, but you don't get to argue for management by saying management.<p>> the StartUp will fail because of lack of direction<p>Startups fail because the folks involved stop working.<p>What's the evidence showing that business folk usefully add direction in a way that reduces the odds of that happening?  Again - the comparison involves knowing what engineers actually do.",1233582943

462233,comment,461076,462113,0,0,gjm11,,,"Einstein did not convert to any kind of deism as a result of seeing the great Intelligence inside Nature and concluding that there must be a Supreme Intelligence. More specifically, (1) he did not believe in a Supreme Intelligence (he explicitly disclaimed belief in a personal God, and likened his view to that of Spinoza who more or less used ""God"" as a synonym for ""Nature""), and (2) there was no ""conversion"".<p>Antony Flew is not one of ""the best scientists"" for the simple reason that he was never a scientist at all. He is a philosopher. Also, there is much reason (entirely independent of his conversion to deism) to believe that his mental faculties are in pretty bad shape. Which is fair enough for someone in his eighties, of course, but the argument ""this must make sense if an eminent philosopher is convinced by it"" -- which is a pretty hopeless argument in any case, considering some of the things eminent philosophers have been convinced by -- really doesn't work at all when the eminent philosopher no longer has the sharp mind that made him an eminent philosopher in the first place.",1233581349
462232,comment,460527,460527,0,0,jlouis,,,"I don't think it is entirely wrong to be harsh on comments. What Tufte is trying to achieve is value on his site. Every comment that do not provide value is then removed.<p>The alternative option can give a worse signal-to-noise ratio. Bad signal-to-noise ratio will make all intelligent beings with little time on hand go to other places, because wading through all the noise is too expensive. In that respect, it might be worth being harsh on comments to keep certain commentors on the site.<p>I don't see it as censorship. You are free to make your own blog post condemning the view, start a comment-stream, use well-argued points, etcetera. In fact if the discussion is so vastly different it would probably be better served as a post of its own, laid out with good argumentation.",1233581327

There is no doubt that computers can do a lot of lifting in orchestrating and making arrangements just using basic music theory.  Some of it may even be creative and useful.  Most of it will be elevator arrangement trash.<p>Still, you're not going to be able to have computers write meaningful lyrics.

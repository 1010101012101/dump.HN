1903080,comment,1903024,1903034,0,0,ssp,,,"A lot of the classic Unix security advice is pretty outdated. For example the idea that someone getting ""root"" access is worse than someone gaining ""ssp"" access.  Everything interesting is already readable and writable by ssp.  The only new thing root can do is destroy stuff that can pretty easily be recreated.<p>The root account is still useful to prevent ssp from accidentally screwing things up, but as a security measure it's pointless in many cases.",1289735884

1903063,comment,1902840,1902840,0,0,vog,,,"This article vastly overstates the role of closures. The connection isn't that deep - it is a simple consequence of life being a super-complex software executed in a biochemical machinery. Thus, you can find any programming construct the process of life, and argue that life wouldn't work without that.<p>There are lots of much more important things than closures. One example is the ability be self-referential on all levels (not to be confused with plain recursion). This blurs not only the line between code and data, but also between software and hardware. And this happens in a much deeper way than we're able to do now with things like FPGA/CPLD or hardware virtualization.<p>If you are really interested in that topic, I recommend the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" by Douglas Hofstadter.

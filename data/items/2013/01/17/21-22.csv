You submit an order, and get boards in the mail. It's like designing and getting custom t-shirts made, expect much more involved.<p>* How do I know which components to put on a board?<p>Mostly datasheets. Once you identify your subsystems (I want this micro, that USB interface, this video chip) you get the datasheets and read them to learn how to design the schematic for that part. How do you pick what micro or USB chip? I start by browsing hobbyist websites to see what is popular and digikey to see what meets my specs and is cheap.<p>* How do I know what components go where?<p>On a hobbyist board running in the kHz range? They mostly go where they fit. There are no rules, just guidelines- group things by how they connect, so you have less wire everywhere. Rats-nests are hard to design and debug, and component placement is the #1 way to fight rats-nest. Put central components (like the microcontroller) in the center. Put ports on the edge of the board. Put the USB chip next to the USB port.<p>* How do I test the system I want to build.<p>You build it. There's no simulation.

For one, I strongly expect share sheets on iOS to be shown only by the normal ""share"" icon; for another, I don't expect double-tapping on a grabber to do anything. Inherent in a grabber is its ""grabbiness"": it's something tactile that you drag, not something you tap on.

Users, especially non-technical ones, have an expectation that you can reply to any email (set the reply-to on your outgoing message to a mailbox you monitor if you want a cheap test). Depending on your product, reply-by-email can give you a fairly competent mobile experience on the cheap.<p>Highly recommend mailgun for this, since the routes + email cleaning (removing signatures, replies, etc.) makes this super simple to implement. At frid.ge we used sendgrid (mailgun didn't exist at the time) and spent a lot of time dealing with problems that mailgun has already solved (at least better than we ever did - stripping signatures without destroying the message body is very difficult).",1358458302

We had just hired, abused, and lost a guy who had been the CTO of his previous company, got hired in and forced to clean up message catalogs in i18n code, and quit after the slotting committee decided he was really 'junior engineer' level and should be put on a performance improvement plan so that he could learn to ""step it up.""<p>I don't know how common his situation was, I was fairly outspoken (no surprise) and he had reached out to me early on when he was trying to figure things out. The PIP (which is basically a pre-cursor to being fired) basically put him over the edge, and he quit. The sad thing was of course this guy was really smart, had excellent design sense, and knew more about the way Java worked than I did and I was one of the original developers of Java at Sun! A real top notch kind of guy.<p>He had been caught in the 'perfect storm' of which there were many, of a manager whose project was strategic to the company and understaffed, a skillset that waaay out ranked his assignment, so even doing perfect work it wouldn't begin to show his capabilities, and a 'peer review' system that primarily tested social engineering skills rather than technical skills. Everybody lost. He lost his job, Google lost a great engineer, the system lost an opportunity to improve.<p>The essence of the discussion with Alan boiled down to ""Its a complex system and its going to have some failures, but by and large it works well so unless you can come up with something better we're stuck with it.""<p>So in some ways the interview process is a good test to see if you might be the kind of person that would do well at Google.",1358457395

There is a good live music night almost every night of the week. (Guilt & Co, Railway, Commodore, Media Club, Orpheum)<p>> Downtown is practically dead by 8pm, which is nice. Granville Street which should be like Market Street, is instead almost like a dead street, Robson has a lot of tourists, but no real culture except coffee shops.<p>Downtown being dead by 8pm is no longer true.

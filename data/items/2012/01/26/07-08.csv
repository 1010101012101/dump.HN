3513204,comment,3511087,3511087,2,0,yason,,,"In the last ten years or so, most big companies tried this new programming language called ""What"".<p>First, they wrote their programs in the <i>form of what they want</i> it to do. Then they left the dreary <i>how part</i> to a sufficiently smart new compiler called ""Outsource"" that was generally available only in India and other low-cost-but-technically-competitive countries. After sending the source code to ""Outsource"", the first compiler pass would start. It might come back asking some clarifications and details for ambiguous cases and they refined their program as needed. Finally, after waiting for a few weeks they got back some results.<p>The resulting program was tested and any problems written down, and more refinitions followed by a set of new iteration rounds to and from the ""Outsource"" compiler suite.<p>Turns out, to describe the hard parts of a problem in sufficient detail equals more or less writing the program itself. It's just that instead of the laid off local programmers, the development managers and technical leads that hadn't have to code much earlier had to do the programming. They could describe their programs in English but they couldn't escape detailing the hard parts of their problems. And then again, the easy parts of programming never were a significant cost-factor in the first place.<p>Then some people figured that instead of having people program the smart remote programmers without domain knowledge to do what was needed, they could employ nearly as smart local programmers with domain knowledge to do the whole programming. The upfront costs would be higher but on the other hand the hard process of explaining the hard parts of a problem, which was needed regardless of the programming scheme, was much easier because communication was almost instant and the programmers both held local domain knowledge <i>and</i> programming skills.<p>While the local programmers still had to spend expensive time writing some unavoidable boilerplate, it was left unclear whether using ""Outsource"" saved any money at all because the terms of programming with it were also so different.",1327562014

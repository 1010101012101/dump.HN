In Copenhagen it's a major advantage to be on bicycle, specially in rush hour where you easily get from A to B 2-3-4 times faster than cars.<p>Rain is not really a factor, Copenhagen is rainy all the fucking time. Steep roads definitely is. But it isn't all. In Buenos Aires, which is relatively flat, I saw maybe 3-4 bikes in as many weeks. The major factor, IMO, is presence of bicycle paths and the fact that bicycles are actually a <i>part</i> of the design of the 'traffic flow', which means that bikers are first class citizen in Danish cities, while I would never even fuckin' dare to ride a bike in Buenos Aires - it's simply not safe.",1232729638

446592,comment,446482,446565,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"That's not the answer to the question. That's ""government statistics"". It's meaningless to refer to a safety statistic like ""45 to 88 percent of brain injury can be prevented by a helmet"" without understanding how frequent brain injury is in the overall population of bicycle riders.<p>According to that site, having everyone wear a helmet could prevent 250 to 500 deaths each year out of 80 million bicycle riders (700 deaths, two-thirds with brain injury, 45 to 88 percent prevention with helmets, 80 million riders). So if you wear a helmet, there is a half of a thousandth of a percent chance that you will benefit from it.<p>When you look at it THAT way, the safety improvement sounds trivial, nowhere near the size of the benefit from wearing a seatbelt. It gives a whole different perspective than ""45 to 88 percent of brain injury can be prevented by a helmet"".<p>And, that site pulls data from ""multiple sources"", not all of which may be legitimate, and appears to be a pro-helmet propaganda site.",1232729432

446583,story,,,26,18,mshafrir,"Ask HN: Building a trust system into a social app",,"I'm starting out on developing my first social web app, and the question of trust and credibility keeps coming up in my mind.  My web app would be worthless without allowing users to input content into the system, but giving users unrestricted ability to input content would quickly fill the site with noise.  I need to have a good way to identify not only spammers and users who might try to game the system, but users who may inadvertently put in noise/bad data.  Likewise, I also want both the system and other users to be able to implicitly and explicitly recognize those users that should be trusted, based on the value of the content they have submitted.<p>I have seen the following approaches:<p>- voting system (e.g. Digg, HackerNews), wherein the trust is at the content item level, and the can be influenced by positive or negative voting - once the net voting passes a certain positive threshold, the content is made more visible to the community.<p>- feedback system (e.g. eBay), wherein the trust is at the user level and can be influenced by other users<p>- feature unlocking (e.g. StackOverflow, HackerNews), wherein users need to meet certain usage goals in the system in order to have access to features that are deemed to require higher trust<p>- human review, wherein content is submitted for approval and reviewed by an admin/maintainer user.  This approach certainly doesn't scale, but may be useful in initially ""seeding the system"".<p>My post is short on details, but I'd like to keep the discussion open as possible within the domain of trust in a social app.<p>I'm looking for suggest readings, anecdotes, experiences, etc.  What has worked in your app?  What exactly was the problem of ""trust"" in your social application, and how did you solve it?",1232729210

The terms were more or less as follows.<p>1.  I am in the business of invention.  I invent many things.  I cannot possibly disclose all of them.  Hence, ANYTHING I have done in the past is excluded and ANYTHING I will do after I leave your employ is excluded without having to be disclosed.  This is true even if the thing invented can be construed to be directly or indirectly connected to your business.  The only exception to this will be those things directly and explicitly connected to your IP disclosed to me during my employ for a period not to exceed two years after my departure for un-registered un-patented IP.  Normal patent and copyright laws apply - BOTH ways.<p>2.  What I do 0n your time with your equipment on projects specifically assigned to me is yours.<p>3.  What I do on my time with my equipment on my self assigned projects distinct from yours is mine.<p>4.  Since my business is invention, if the invention was concieved on your premises but is not DIRECTLY connected to your business, your disclosed IP, and your assigned project, the invention is mine.  This will be true even if the invention is used to indirectly support project.  In that case, a non-exclusive license to use will be granted by me to you but I still own the resultant IP.<p>Almost without exception, the terms were accepted.

The paying for time argument invariably gets into issues like how much other unproductive time you spend doing things like talking to coworkers, using the bathroom, staring out the window, and browsing the web.  In general it seems to degenerate into the horribly inflexible clock-out-when-you-go-to-the-bathroom factory-ish policy.<p>So if you are happy with his actual concrete performance, then I'd say don't worry about it.  If he can make you happy spending 15 minutes of real work per day, then you need to think hard about how to better leverage his talents.  Unfortunately, increasing your expectations of him while keeping everyone else the same will not make him happy either.  It's still a tough issue.",1232728948

Good programmers wouldn't waste their time working for a company that required them to bother that many people, just so you could figure out if they were a good programmer.<p>Think of it as a barrier to entry.  Good programmers want good opportunities that don't make them bend over backwards to get.  Path of least resistance.<p>If you make it hard for them to work for you -- they won't.<p>Seriously, who wants to call up 10 people and ask them if they mind if some random person calls them?<p>It's a waste of time and any good programmer is going to know this and have plenty of better places to work that don't require 10 recommendations.<p>Also, what a programmer works on doesn't say anything about how smart (s)he is.  If you want to know how smart they are, ask them about as many random things as you can.  How broad is their knowledge base?  Smart programmers know a lot of stuff outside the world of programming.<p>Ask her about philosophy, beer, or cards.  Ask about poker, pizza and travel.<p>Smart people have big minds that expand way beyond personal projects and portfolios. If they have a portfolio /at all/ then they are spending more time on marketing themselves than they are on programming and that's not such a good sign.  I know you don't mean they have a binder with photos of work they did, or maybe you do, but either way, they should be spending more time on programming than marketing their programmer skills.  If they harp on how awesome they are at programming, they probably don't know much about programming.<p>I'd say irrelevant projects done for fun are almost a better sign of smartness than those that were only relevant.<p>Ask the potential candidate about how the projects they have worked on could be improved.  What went wrong, where were the bottlenecks, what kind of hardware was it, did they find any limitations with the software, programming languages, or environments they worked in?<p>Ask them how to build world peace and solve the financial crisis.  See how rational they are.  See how honest they are.<p>Introspection, Honesty and Rationality are probably the three most important characteristics I look for in programmers.  If they can communicate with the ""real world"" around them as well, that's a plus.<p>Most people in the real world can't handle the amount of thought, blunt truth, and rationality that programmers dish out, so it becomes the job of the programmer to figure out how to communicate with others, so that just brings me back to the 10 recommendations thing...  Probably not a good idea.  I hope that was hyperbole.",1232728928

My quick summary: Fingerprints are effectively useless for security.<p>Technology reasons: Some systems are better than others but none is perfect.  False positives and false negatives are part of the system.  The worst part is not that everyone is affected .001% of the time but that a few people (usually older people or people who work with their hands) are affected most of the time.<p>Security reasons: As mentioned in the article, fingerprints need to be treated as public information.  You leave them everywhere and are not that tricky to copy.  Mythbusters did a nice episode on this.  Also, you can't change them once they've been compromised.  For a while I worked in a Top-Secret environment and we didn't use fingerprints exactly because they weren't secure and, worse, could give a false sense of security.<p>Convenience reasons:  Given that you shouldn't use them for high security systems what about low security systems.  I hacked a fingerprint reader onto my car and thought it was so cool.  I took it to a local car dealer to get his impression.  He showed me a new BMW that used a proximity card to unlock the car - blew my system away for convenience.<p>Societal reasons: There are a lot of people who will just never feel comfortable giving their fingerprint to a computer.  The stigma is that's what criminals do.  Most common lame joke when doing a fingerprint demo: ""You gonna give that to the FBI?, ha ha ha"".<p>Now one of you may come up with a way around all these issues.  I know you can get a fingerprint reader on your laptop.  I used to think it was pretty impressive when I had one of the first.  Eventually the novelty wore off and the inconvenience factors led me to stop using it.  I'd like to hear if someone has had more success than I did.",1232727408

The point I'd get is that the US government might not default on the debt, but what will those dollars be worth at the end of this?<p>The 1933 resolution can be seen as a default or the government saying that they'll only deal in dollars from now on - which might not be as good for investors and therefore rob them of <i>some</i> of their value.  Since the government today doesn't have debts in non dollar form, why would they default?  They can just print money.  The idea that any government would default on a debt denominated in their own currency that they can readily print is ridiculous.<p>The only problem is that the money you get from them might not be worth much if we see a decent rate of inflation.  That's where the article strikes at our current situation.  The gold debt was protected against inflation (assuming that the supply of gold didn't increase much).  Those investors were then subjected to inflation as the US renounced gold denominated bonds.<p>Since the US doesn't have bonds in anything other than dollars, this situation wouldn't happen today.",1232726590

826048,comment,825612,825612,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I don't understand why Friedman would prefer to produce solar panels in America than ship them from China. Trading between nations makes sense for the same reason trading between individuals makes sense: specialization is efficient, leading everyone to greater wealth.<p>He mentions that China will have a great export platform in renewable energy technology as the world adds 2.5 billion more people. So he's anticipating future demand. It seems to me that that is useful information for entrepreneurs, but it's nothing that demands government action. If entrepreneurs decide it would be profitable to supply that impending demand, then they will. If the government has to subsidize to make that happen, then maybe it shouldn't happen.<p>Just because there will be future demand for something doesn't mean we need government action to supply it. I'm sure those billions of people will want pants and meat and toothbrushes too, but there's no particular reason why America has to be the place to produce those. Just let people produce whatever they decide is most profitable for them to produce, and we're likely to get a more efficient outcome than one decided by central planning.<p>I think solar energy is great. If we want it, all we have to do is worry about the demand side, not the supply side. That is, consumers and governments should buy the best, cheapest solar panels available. I don't think it matters where the production, or the R&D, happens.<p>He suggests that trading solar panels with China might be similar to trading oil with Saudi Arabia. I don't understand why. Trading with Saudi Arabia is considered a problem because the money is thought to fuel terrorism. China doesn't have the nicest foreign policy on the planet, but I'd love to make them more rich, not less, because they seem to be becoming more peaceful as they grow richer. And if China ever starts funding terrorism, it is much easier to set up new solar panel factories than it is to set up new oil fields.",1253116318

If we can't at least get to the level of understanding marginal utility it is going to kill us.  More modern economic theories are paid lip service to in the form of being implemented whenever doing so is politically expedient.  This is the polar opposite of the spirit of econ.

The problem with columnists/pundits who argue for investing in xyz ""because we're falling behind"" particularly where it relates to immature technologies is that governments have a notoriously bad track record at playing/picking favorites that ultimately win out.<p>Taking this column specifically, what if it turns out that natural gas is far cheaper and far more abundant than solar - at least in the mid and near term? (after you factor in recent shale gas discoveries, it is).  Why not instead develop technologies through companies that enable solar like Applied Materials and in the meantime buy subsidized panels from other countries if that's your cup of tea?<p>I should note that many of us here are also aware and even aim to replace longstanding competitors who are larger, often better capitalized and are certainly more entrenched with technologies that are cheaper, without the legacy overhead costs and are more agile.  Why shouldn't this happen in solar/energy?<p>In solar in particular, look at thin film solar firms like Nanosolar - <a href=""http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/nanosolar-solar-power-efficiency-germany-factory-mass-production.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/nanosolar-solar-powe...</a> - yes, one of their robotic plant may be in Germany, but it is a US developed technology that may end up being far cheaper than traditional solar panels. If anything, American firms have shown when the incentive exists, they can play catch up and they can do it quickly and generally better as US dominance across an array of industries shows (disclosure: I'm a Canadian).<p>This, incidentally is what can happen when the subsidies go away: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125193815050081615.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125193815050081615.html</a>",1253115691

If the communicating agent is not known to receiving agent then the message is tagged ""unknown"" if it originates outside of visual range and with the communicating agent's identity if it originates within visual range.<p>- knowing rules: an agent becomes known to another agent if the agent communicates to the other agent within visual range (eg: if you talk to me when I can see you I know your voice now)<p>-- INFECTION RULES:<p>- all agents have a variable tracking the amount of zombie toxin in their bloodstream; this ranges from 0 to 100.<p>- a noninfected agent becomes infected when they cross the '50' level of zombie toxin. At the moment of infection they instantly shoot up to '100' zombie toxin.<p>- a noninfected agent loses zombie toxin @ a linear rate (with floor @ 0)<p>- an infected agent loses zombie toxin @ a slow-ish exponential decay; it should take them awhile to decay from<p>- an infected agent becomes uninfected when they cross the '25' level of zombie toxin.<p>-- MOVEMENT RULES:<p>- noninfected agents move more quickly than infected agents<p>- all agents have a finite maximum turning speed<p>- noninfected agents move progressively slower the more zombie toxin they have (eg: base speed - (penalty x (ZombieToxin/100))<p>- infected agents move progressively slower the less zombie toxin they have (eg: base speed + (booster x (ZombieToxin/100))<p>-- INFECTED BEHAVIOR:<p>- infected are understood as trying to produce more infected.<p>- INFECTING: infected who are within some infection radius of a noninfected agent for > some minimum # of timesteps begin to infect the agent with zombie toxin at some rate (perhaps: higher rate the more zombie toxin there is); the agent doing the infecting also gets increased zombie toxin at some fractional rate (eg: if an infected agent adds Z zombie toxin to an noninfected agent's bloodstream then the infected agent gets .7 * Z zombie toxin, also). The infected agen ThInfection ""stacks"" on agents.<p>- INFECTING: infection (zombie toxin increasing) stacks on the receiving agent; ""multiple zombies can attack the same survivor at the same time""<p>- INFECTING: zombies can't attack multiple agents at the same time; ""a zombie can only be biting one survivor at a time""<p>- HUNTING: zombies are either ""hunting"" or ""wandering"". A zombie ""wanders"" (random walk) when it isn't doing anything else. A zombie can determine if some other zombie in its field of vision is hunting or wandering.<p>- HUNTING, LOWEST PRIORITY: if a zombie sees a sufficiently strong and unambiguous zombie scent trail it will go into ""hunting"" mode and follow the trail until it thins out<p>- HUNTING, NEXT LOWEST PRIORITY: if a zombie sees a sufficiently strong and unambiguous noninfected scent trail it will go into ""hunting"" mode and follow the trail until it thins out<p>- HUNTING, NEXT LOWEST PRIORITY: if a zombie sees other ""hunting"" zombies it starts chasing the nearest ""hunting"" zombie<p>- HUNTING, HIGHEST PRIORITY: if a zombie sees noninfected agent it immediately begins chasing the agent<p>- WANDERING: a zombie returns to wandering mode when none of the above conditions trigger<p>-- SURVIVOR BEHAVIOR:<p>- I'd make this pluggable (and then the fun really begins!) but the general behavior is to try to avoid getting infected, presumably by avoiding contact with zombies (break incoming zombie hordes into clusters with similar movement vectors; project movement vectors forward in time; aim to be elsewhere)<p>-- MAP:<p>- some tile-based system with walls and open spaces is a good starting point",1253115467

Your safety is maintained by keeping a group of friends who can warn you of impending threats and who will gather together to defend themselves (and hunt down criminals) when necessary.

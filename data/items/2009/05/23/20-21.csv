JIF if a reasonable metric for journals, the problem is that it's used to rate authors: what's the JIF of journals you publish in?<p>The metric presented here is much better for rating authors because it gives more of an author's peers an opportunity to vouch for him by citing his work, as opposed to only a small editorial board and review committee who decide if he gets into TopJournalX.<p>Adding a pagerank-style coefficient (increasing the weight of citations that come from well-cited papers) would make this metric even better for precisely the reason you state: papers exist in perpetuity. If I write a paper now but it is ignored for 50 years, then someone builds upon that to break ground in an entirely new field, then I deserve some indirect credit for that.

623812,comment,623614,623614,0,0,amstrash,,,"(reposted on coding horror)<p>I strongly recommend that you read The Psychology of Computer Programming by Weinberg and please, please, please do not espouse this kind of stuff. As a hiring manager I would never want to hire a programmer who is so proud of their code that somebody rewriting their code motivates them. There is a very big difference in ""taking pride"" in your work and ""being proud"" of your work. I will take the former any day and shun the latter any day. Most projects are about team work and rewrites are a fact of life. I would go so far as to say the if you are not rewriting/refactoring your code, you are missing something big that will come back to bite you.<p>If you want to motivate a programmer, understand that if the programmer cannot find something in the project that appeals to them, you _will_ not get 100% from the person. Programmers IMO need to be challenged, but with tough, new or complex (not the same as tough) problems not by appealing to their egos and touching off an internecine war. Part of their work needs to be in an area that they are interested in. They need to have the flexibility to work when they want where they want (within limits of course). Provide them the resources required to get the job done and learn at the same time. Some form of free food also helps. If they still need extra motivation maybe its time for an honest conversation with them as to what they want to do and why its not working.<p>Just my $.02\nAM",1243111774

623807,comment,623345,623750,0,0,eries,,,"Thanks for the really thoughtful comment. Let me try and unpack your question into a few parts, and answer each one separately.<p>First of all, the fundamental feedback loop doesn't require A/B tests. What matters is that you act in a disciplined way to transform ideas into products, measure what happens, and learn for the next set of ideas. Over time, you should get faster at executing this feedback loop, not slower. A/B testing is a great methodology, but not the only one. You might take a look at Net Promoter Score (NPS) for example, as one alternate way of gauging customer reaction to the changes you're making. If you look at the actual practice of science, you'll notice that not all branches can do controlled experimentation. In cosmology, for example, they have to rely on ""natural experiments"" because they (so far) lack the tools to conduct experiments involving large gravitational masses, etc. Subjective forms of data-collection, like in-person interviews and usability tests, can provide ""validated learning about customers"" if you are disciplined about it.<p>Second, I'm not sure I agree that you can't do A/B split-tests in this situation. The number of customers you have per day is not really relevant - that only affects how long it takes you to get a statistically significant result. You might need weeks to get enough customers through your 50/50 test to get good data, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's a bad idea. It might ""slow you down"" from the point of view of coding, but if it prevents you from building a feature that nobody wants, that speeds you up much more.<p>In fact, I would work backwards from ""what do I need to have in order to validate my hypotheses"" and then structure the rest of your business around that. For example, you might not want to spend the dollars on AdWords to drive traffic to your business at this stage, because the ROI is not high enough yet. On the other hand, if increased traffic leads to rapid iteration which leads to customer validation, that might be a good trade-off. Do what you have to do to accelerate your learning.<p>Last, your fear about the differences in types of customers is important to address. Start getting clear about the ""customer archetype"" you think is most likely to use your product. What does a day in their life look like, for example? Why are they crazy enough to use your early-stage product, instead of the more rational thing which would be to buy from an established player?<p>If I had to guess, I would say that, most likely, your current customers all have something pretty specific in common. Although they may have wildly different demographics and usage patterns, it's likely that they are all early adopters of ... something. Otherwise, they wouldn't be wasting their time with your product. The more you understand what that is, the better you'll be able to tailor your product to their needs. But, more importantly, this commonality probably means your split-tests (and usability tests) have more validity than you think.<p>Last note, just because you _can_ run split-tests on trivial changes (like ""whether or not I add a button somewhere"") doesn't mean that you should use them for that purpose. You can also run split-tests on big, meaty changes that elicit a strong reaction from customers. And if you recall from basic statistics, the incidence rate of the thing being measured is just as important in determining significance as the sample size. Thus, if you're split-testing important things, you can get a good result with much smaller samples. And, as an early-stage startup, I'd maintain it's only worth testing things that (you believe) have a large impact.<p>Does that help?<p>Further reading on the topic:\n<a href=""http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/split-test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/split...</a><p><a href=""http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/listening%20to%20customers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/liste...</a><p><a href=""http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/customer%20development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/custo...</a>",1243111025

In other words negotiate for your % of ownership, pay for it now at ""today's price"" for the company (and execute the 83(b)), and have your stock subject to buyback restrictions that are on a vesting schedule (such that your true ownership of that % may take three to five years).<p>See <a href=""http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83b-election/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83...</a>",1243110672

What intellectual diversity there is comes from the students, not the professors.<p>Also, I did not just present five data points.  Each article I cited presents evidence that the entire field of study is off base.  I am saying that the vast majority of the poetry, history, architecture, economics, sociology, political science, philosophy, and English that comes out of the modern universities is systematically biased and wrong.<p>Sure there are a few good history books produced now and then.

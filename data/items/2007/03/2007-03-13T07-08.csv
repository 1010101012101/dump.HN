If you have a founder story, it's my hope that you also share it here, for all of us. From 'The HP Way', by David Packard:<p>""Largely because of (Fred) Terman's classes, the four of us - Hewlett, Porter, Oliver, and I (Packard) - became fast friends. It is not a coincidence that a few years later this group would become the management team of HP. Our (Bill and I) common interest in the outdoors first manifested itself in our junior year. There is no question that a shared love of the outdoors strengthened our friendship and helped build a mutual understanding and respect that is the core of their successful business relationship lasting more than a half century.""<p>At the start of Dave's junior year as a Stanford electrical engineer, he demonstrated an interest in ham radios that caught Terman's eye. This led to his invitation to join Terman's graduate course on ham radios, which also included Bill and others, who were crucial to starting and building HP. And the rest, as they say, is history.<p>I hope this story (and the story you have to share) inspires you and the YC faithful, helping you with THE question: how do I find my cofounder? ",1173772779

3849,comment,3769,3837,0,0,pg,,,"You can't talk about VCs generally because there's such a difference between the good ones and the bad ones.  The good ones serve their investors pretty well.<p>We'd never compete with VCs, incidentally.  It's a completely different world from ours.  They invest on behalf of other people (or more often, institutions).  So while they have huge resources at their command, they have to answer to their investors, and this makes them excessively conservative.  We much prefer using our own money, even if it limits what we can do.",1173770772

The COPPA law allows you as a parent to determine that for yourselves but rightfully doesn't try to force providers to do so (you can understand the logistics nightmare that would become).<p>So the solution to both the real names policy and the under 13 year-old policy is simple.  Take matters into your own hands.<p>Buy a domain name and DNS service.  Sign this service up for Google applications for domains and then give accounts to up to 25 kids if you wish.  Note that you will be responsible for complying with the COPPA regulations ... not too hard if it's for your own kids but perhaps it wouldn't be wise to provide this service to other's kids.<p>At some point in the relatively near future, you can expect G+ will be enabled for applications for domains (gradually almost every Google service has) and I don't see how they can force these domains to use any more real names than those entered for the domain's users.  By definition, these are the names the users are commonly known by.  Whether a real name or an alias, their colleagues must know this to be a valid alias/nick since they're using it as an e-mail handle.<p>Good luck!",1316393785

I've never heard of anyone actually documenting every click it takes to configure Outlook. I don't even know what you're talking about when you say you ""index"" and ""abstract"" API docs--I just keep them open in a browser window and search for things I don't remember offhand. Maybe all this busywork is a coping strategy for being out of your depth, but it still isn't productive.<p>Here's how I solved the backup problem: I bought an external hard drive, connected it to my Mac, and clicked ""yes"" when my Mac asked if I wanted to use it for backups. Here's how I solved my email problem: I set up Google Apps on my domain, which took a total of maybe 30 minutes (though I'm sure you'd go through and document every single click it took to configure the DNS settings). Here's how I got my first editor: I got TextMate and started using it, and was productive from the first second. As far as scripting languages for building code, I think I learned how to use make and that's about it. <i>That's all I needed to do to be productive</i>. I can, and in many cases have, wasted time wanking over configuring everything in finer detail, but that's not a useful mentality.<p>It's probably not even about Microsoft at this point.

Sure, I let Windows and IIS handle that!<p>But, consider a Web page that needs to execute a SQL query.  SQL Server runs in a different 'process', likely in a different address space, maybe on a different machine, real or virtual.  So, how does the Web page communicate with SQL Server?  Sure:  That's already worked out by Microsoft.  BUT:  There IS communications, and it is 'asynchronous'.<p>Okay.  What holds for a Web page getting to SQL Server can also hold for a Web page getting to some other software possibly particular to the Web site.<p>So, suppose the design of the Web site has a program that needs to run as a 'service' and be accessed from the Web pages 'asynchronously'.  So, how to do that communications?<p>I looked into Windows 'remoting' (now considered obsolete by Microsoft), the Windows version of old remote procedure call (RPC), Windows Communications Foundation (WCF), Windows pipes (on the same machine), and old TCP/IP sockets.  Just to investigate these may have involved over 100 Web pages at MSDN.<p>I settled on old TCP/IP sockets.  For the data to be sent/received, to convert to/from instances of classes, I settled on 'serialization'.<p>So, I got (back) into TCP/IP sockets.  I've done socket programming for over 20 years.  To get started with sockets on Windows, I started with some simple socket code in the scripting language Rexx.  I got both the 'client' and 'server' sides working with each other.  Then I wrote the server side in Visual Basic .NET (the Microsoft 'managed code' version of their TCP/IP) and got that working with the client side code in Rexx.  Then I wrote the client side code in VB.NET and got it working with the server side code in both Rexx and VB.NET.<p>Now the TCP/IP code is ready to drop into the VB Web page code and the VB 'remote server' code.<p>But using TCP/IP and serialization for this communications was the easy way.<p>Net, all your criticisms have turned out to be unjustified.  I've done nothing wrong.  What I wrote to begin with was right on target.  Being so consistently wrong you should fear will hurt your credibility.  It's not good to be so consistently wrong.",1316392693

I don't know much about the European revolutions of 1848 and would have like to read about that time from them. I already had read a lot of ancient Greek literature in translation as well as <i>The Pentateuch</i>, all the historical books of the <i>Old Testament</i> and the <i>Gospels</i>. Western Civilization springs from intellectual roots in Athens and Jerusalem, so any survey has to include that heritage. My degree is in Comparative Literature, so I put a lot of stock in origninal source material. The only languages I read are English and German, so everything is in English or translation except <i>Faust</i>, which IMO would be a waste in translation. The books I read for my survey (this was my survey to fill in my personal Bildungslcke) are not all classics, and not even all to be recommended. It may appear surprisingly heavy on 20th century, but a lot of intellectual threads I thought I should understand better got kicked off in that century.

You should avoid it for anything you're doing over the internet. Use either SFTP or rsync. This is great though, because you could easily port it to other transport tools, like the ones mentioned above.<p>Even better, if you're automating deployment, move the security management outside your app entirely and require users to use ssh-keypairs. This way no password authentication is required, and you don't have to worry about storing someone else's password.<p>For ideas about other features to implement, have a look at Fabric [1]. Although, it looks like their site is down right now. One of the most common features of deployment systems are ""hooks"". Hooks allow you to execute other code at different events during deployment.

Companies like Lodsys that want to sue dozens of companies will have to do it in dozens of separate suits.<p>This hurts them in three ways:<p>1. Their litigation costs will go way up.<p>2. Defendants will be much more successful in getting venue changes to a forum of their choice, instead of being force to defend where the troll files. (When there were multiple defendants in one suit, carefully chosen by the troll to be from all over the country, it was hard for a defendant to get a venue change to their home turf because the court would want to keep all the cases together for judicial efficiency, and there would be no district that would be better for all the defendants). This further drives up the costs to the troll because now they will not only be litigating dozens of suits, they will be scatted are over the country.<p>3. They have a much greater chance of losing their patent. Each trial provides an opportunity for a judge or jury to decide on any number of grounds that the patent is invalid. Once a patent is ruled invalid, that's it for that patent.<p>There's a good post elaborating on those points from Red Hat's senior patent counsel here: <a href=""http://opensource.com/law/11/9/new-patent-reform-law-could-reduce-lawsuits-non-practicing-entity?sc_cid=70160000000IDmjAAG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.com/law/11/9/new-patent-reform-law-could-r...</a><p>Toss in the new rules making it easier to challenge a patent, and the new rules that increase the scope of prior art, and this is overall a pretty good bill from a programmer's point of view.",1316391038

I work with quite a few of these reasonably qualified electronic engineers, EE's and managers who all love how fast we can turn out prototypes and concepts using the Arduino platform.\nTrue that the platform itself does not go into commercial designs, but the ATMega168 and 328 chips certainly do and priced quite competitively at quantity.",1316390638

It's quite a good idea if you want to game HN to upvote selfish support/articles and/or downvote undesirable comments/articles. It's more possible to get attention to flagged articles, but risky because moderators will look at the content and strip away flag and the up/down vote powers.<p>2) Train the spam filter to like those messages. Unlikely, but attempted against email spam filters though (Look up 'unsolicited bizarre nonsense email stories').<p>3) People with nothing to say but really feel that they must say something even if it's not contributing. I gather the sentiment is that those people should follow the HN guidelines and spirit because there are those that fear the immature link aggregator plague (Reddit, Digg, etc). There's no help for them otherwise.",1316390572

What I like about their plan is that it's a little easier for them to target people with disposable income. I imagine one in a Walmart parking lot wouldn't do very well.<p>I saw something the other week that I hadn't seen before. It looked like a personal trainer was working out a client in our office parking lot. He set up cones, heavy rope, some weights, etc.",1316390570

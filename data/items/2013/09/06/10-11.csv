We&#x27;re at the tail end of a decades long stock market boom and a decades long boom in housing prices. My parents have a $1.5m house in Virginia. My dad started with a $120k house and traded up a couple of times over 25 years. It was just a great time to be a professional with a little bit of cash flow. No need to sell a startup to Yahoo or take any bribes!<p>Looking at it another way, the median net worth of freshman congressmen is $1m.

There&#x27;s still a lot of information to use: the main topics of the community, for example. TV, radio and newspaper advertisement worked fine for decades. Web services can be created with significant less resources than TV stations and newspapers, but we are meant to believe that they are only viable if users relinquish their anonymity?

6339699,comment,6332038,6338704,1,0,roarroar,,,">I don&#x27;t use fire weapons and every time I&#x27;ve beaten the fire sage, I&#x27;ve done it by reading its actions and responding appropriately - and this in particular is the absolute strength of the game.<p>So why bother with all the fancy environments (which are extremely costly to produce)? Why bother with all the character builds? What a load of garbage.  The combat is in fact clunky and repetitive. You wouldn&#x27;t play this game if it was just boss battles, which just goes to show that it&#x27;s not the key strength of the game. The key strength of both games are the environments, with the boss serving the SECONDARY purpose of providing a climax.<p>And the point of my post is not that Demon Firesage is impossible without fire weapons. I&#x27;ve beat it without fire weapons, and it is one of the easiest bosses. My point is that the game is poorly organized and in many ways counter-intuitive. And Demon Firesage is a perfect example of this. So what is your rebuttal? Are you even making one? Do you have a brain? You look like someone who is so in love with Dark Souls that when someone (A FAN OF THE GAME NO LESS) criticizes it you run in all butthurt looking for something to take issue with, barely bothering to read what was said before replying.<p>>It really isn&#x27;t &#x27;designed for use with a wiki&#x27;<p>It has the URL of the wiki on the back of the PS3 case. So does Demon&#x27;s Souls. They very clearly intended players to have the wiki available. Did you think I came into this thread not knowing it was on the PS3? Motherfucker I own it on the PS3 as well as the PC. It is quite possible to finish the game without the wiki. But the point of a game is to be ENJOYED, not finished. And the level of trial-and-error present in Dark Souls detracts from the experience. This doesn&#x27;t apply in Demon&#x27;s Souls because it&#x27;s just that much simpler and smaller. Are you going to respond to this, or just post more reactive bullshit about Demon Firesage, which was an EXAMPLE?<p>>I relished the challenge that the game provided, a game that rewards skilful play more than decking your character (and I&#x27;m not particularly dextrous).<p>Good for you. Maybe you&#x27;ll get around to making a point in this reply?<p>>You seem intent on min/maxing.<p>I&#x27;m not &quot;min-maxing&quot; anything. There&#x27;s no need to &quot;min-max&quot; Demon Firesage. It&#x27;s not a hard boss.<p>>but it doesn&#x27;t make it a shit game because you didn&#x27;t like developing that skill.<p>Are you a fucking imbecile? I finished this game 3x. I will probably finish it again. It is a nice game, and nowhere near as hard as the hype would suggest. But it is very poorly organized, and overall a less polished product than Demon&#x27;s Souls. So here&#x27;s a crazy idea I just had: maybe next time read the top-level comment so you know the general point being made and respond to that, instead of reactively scanning deep into the thread to find something to take out of context. And then maybe you will succeed in responding to something I actually thought or said. Like the fact that it Dark Souls is a messy game oriented heavily toward trial-and-error. So please just read what I said in this post, understand it (this is important when talking to people), and then respond to this last about messiness and trial-and-error, because (in spite of the fact that you are too stupid to see it), everything else I&#x27;ve written is just a minor elaboration on this one point.",1378465064

And it doesn&#x27;t need to be a total rejection; they can disregard tons proof of the age of the universe and still know enough math and engineering to make, say, microprocessors.<p>Of course you must have read claims like &quot;the speed of light changes over time&quot; and &quot;all that light was created en-route 6000 years ago&quot;. This allows them to believe a ridiculous premise but still participate in reality and use their GPS with a clean conscience.<p>But I think there are many creationists who can reconcile their differences with reality by believing the seven days of creation are a metaphor or some sort of measure in &quot;God years&quot;, so they can reject evolution like they were brainwashed to, but they have no problem believing in the speed of light and measurements of distances between stars.",1378464962

Like many people, I stayed thin effortlessly in my twenties but really started packing on the pounds right around 30.  I gained enough weight (I was technically obese according to BMI) that it took me a couple of years to get fit again.  I have to really watch what I eat and exercise religiously to stay fit now.<p>Having been fat, do I look down on the fat?  Actually, I do. I know how hard it is to get fit and stay fit, but there are so many benefits I can&#x27;t imagine not doing it. I felt horrible when I was fat.  My knees and back gave me trouble. I felt slow and lethargic. I was afraid to play sports, go hiking, etc. (Hello feedback loop!). My dad (who is fat) developed type 2 diabetes and had some minor heart trouble, so I likely had that to look forward to on top of everything else! Losing weight/getting fit made all that go away. I could easily kick my twenty-something self&#x27;s ass at just about anything now and that feels <i>awesome</i>.  I take full advantage of this. I get out into the mountains and reap the benefits!<p>Consciously, I think it&#x27;d be great if they came up with a pill that made people stay thin and fit without effort (the bacteria in the linked article has the potential to help with just one of these, <i>maybe</i>). Subconsciously I think I&#x27;d resent it if people could get the benefits I&#x27;ve worked hard for with zero effort.

6339648,comment,6339084,6339530,3,0,bad_user,,,"When I said sugar, I actually meant either fructose or sucrose (table sugar). Carbohydrates are technically referred to as <i>sugars</i>, however when speaking about fructose or sucrose, these are <i>simple sugars</i>.<p>The difference between these simple sugars and more complex carbohydrates is that (1) simple sugars are burnt really, really fast by our body, giving us an immediate fuel boost and (2) our body ends up generating insulin in excess.<p>High-fructose corn syrup in particular has been massively used by the food industry to give taste to otherwise tasteless foods. It&#x27;s particularly aggravating since sugar has been used in giving taste to low-fat diet products.<p>We get fat from sugar consumption, because it raises the insulin levels in our blood. Insulin is still a poorly understood hormone, however it has a role in removing the excess glucose from our blood (high levels are toxic) and it is known to stop the use of fat as an energy source (such that our body can consume the sugars first - isn&#x27;t evolution amazing?). As we consume more sugar, we gain insulin resistance (e.g. the cells stop responding to insulin effectively), leading to hyperglycemia, after which the pancreas starts secreting more and more insulin, leading to hyperinsulinemia. And when you&#x27;ve got excess insulin in your blood, the body doesn&#x27;t use fats anymore for fuel, ending up being stored permanently in the fat tissue.<p>Uncontrolled (or due to genetic disorders) this can lead to Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes was commonly attributed to genetic disorders or psychological disorders (stress), however the idea that obesity can lead to diabetes (and not the other way around) is also starting to gain traction. All people suffering from Type 2 Diabetes are predisposed to being obese, if they aren&#x27;t already - actually I know people with type 2 diabetes and none of them are slim. Taken to extremes, somebody with Type 2 Diabetes could very well die of hunger, while still being fat.<p>WARNING - by consuming artificial sweeteners, you&#x27;re not really solving the problem, because the problem is insulin secretion by the pancreas, which is being triggered as a reflex ever since the sugar hits your taste buds. It&#x27;s slightly better, but the best thing would be to cut sugar entirely from your diet and only resort to foods that are naturally sweet, like fruits or milk for your daily/weekly intake. Diet Coke is a bad joke.<p>And the biggest problem we have, is that we got <i>addicted</i> to sugar. An acquaintance of mine working for a cigarette factory was explaining to me that cigarettes are enriched with a little sugar, because they found that sugar is even better for addiction than nicotine.<p>On the other hand, in regards to carbohydrates in general, plants and fruits have been in our diet ever since forever. Not consuming plants and fruits would be a thing as stupid as replacing fats with sugar.",1378464252

LinkedIn is like a corporate party, where everyone is there, connected  but there is no party indeed, just a crowd of faces hanging around. In that way it becomes just another resume service with some job board features through ads. They are trying hard to bring interactivity by small inventions like endorsements, recommendations and also sometimes mirroring similar interactions from Twitter, Facebook to LinkedIn. At the end of the day they are still selling premium membership to jobseekers, (ability to get) connections with inmails and services for headhunters and recruiters to digg into the pile of resumes.<p>I believe LinkedIn can achieve much more than that by creating an application store similar to Google&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s. where 3rd party apps can be listed, featured and installed and billed in a recurring or per-request basis.<p>Through a LinkedIn app store, 3rd parties can bring a lot of innovative functionality to LinkedIn.",1378463082

The point stands: the first play through is largely about bumbling around wasting your time. It is disorganized. It lacks clues. Do you have an answer to this, the thing I actually said? It seems it&#x27;s very hard for you to change your P.O.V. to a superior one, one that can actually be defended with an argument, rather than garbage attacks like accusing me of &quot;whining&quot; because the game is &quot;too hard&quot;. In fact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that hard at all! Which is why in this very thread I spoke about how easy it is to beat the game with vitality builds, which is what I did on my first play through.

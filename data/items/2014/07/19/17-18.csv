There are limitations on duration of stay, what happens with your spouse/family, switching employers, etc etc. That really doesn&#x27;t lend itself to people moving their whole family to the US and buying into becoming permanent residents. If all we get out of the H-1B program is downward pressure and wages and people that will come for 5 years, make a bunch of money, go home and not come back, then I am against the H-1B program.<p>Note that I 100% put the blame for this situation on the US immigration policy and not the people that are H-1B holders.

I&#x27;ve also been in the position of trying to hire developers with similar skill sets. As a result, I might bring a slightly different perspective.<p>I am a US citizen. As you point out, I don&#x27;t need to dress &quot;business casual&quot; and I can (and do) work remotely, and the pay is good.<p>But in some specialties, developers <i>are</i> scarce in the US. They&#x27;re probably also scarce worldwide, but the greater wages available here could entice them to immigrate.<p>In my niche in particular it&#x27;s hard to find <i>good</i> developers for anything like reasonable wages. And in my specialty, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> possible for a typical &quot;generalist&quot; to just hop in and learn quickly; for what I do, you&#x27;d need a broad background in C, C++, cross-platform issues, Windows, Android NDK, and Unix-ish development environments, as well as real-time/game experience. Someone missing <i>any</i> of those would have a steep learning curve.<p>I hear stories of developers making $500k+ per year, or getting job offers worth millions. At <i>that</i> level, then yes, I think we <i>could</i> stand to see a bit of downward pressure on salaries. I&#x27;m not quite there myself, though at my salary&#x27;s current rate of growth I could see hitting that threshold in ten years or less.<p>That said, I do actually agree that H1B workers are often illegally used to pay below-market salaries. [1] I don&#x27;t know how to combat this other than through better monitoring and stronger enforcement of the law. (For example, if an employer is found to be paying less than they should, forcing them to retroactively pay the difference in wages+penalties to any affected employees would be a strong motivator to pay them enough.)<p>Currently, H1B workers need to be paid 100% of the &quot;prevailing wage&quot;; maybe a higher threshold like 110% (or pick a number that makes sense) would convince critics that these workers <i>are</i> really hard to find in the US? Because if you can&#x27;t find someone locally for 110% of the &quot;prevailing wage&quot; then that&#x27;s a compelling argument that they aren&#x27;t here.<p>[1] &quot;Employers affirm in the labor condition application that the wage offered to the applicant is at least as high as that paid by the employer for the same type of job, and the number equals or exceeds the prevailing wage for the job in the same geographical area&quot; <a href=""http://www.immihelp.com/visas/h1b/h1b-visa-requirements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immihelp.com/visas/h1b/h1b-visa-requirements.html</a><p>[edit] added comment about &quot;hire a generalist&quot; not being good enough",1405792606

H-1B visas are a very bad approach towards that goal.<p>The H-1B program, in its current form, suppresses wages because employees have no leverage or bargaining power with their employer. The visa is held by the employer, and if the employer wishes to terminate the visa, the employee may face immediate deportation. If employees had some more flexibility in changing jobs, the power balance wouldn&#x27;t be so one-sided.<p>On a side note, there&#x27;s a question as to whether the H-1B visas are actually being used by employers to attract top talent, since the majority of H-1B visa applications are for the lowest wage bracket. Also, from U.S. News and World Report:<p>&quot;Between 2007 and 2009, Accenture hired nearly 1,400 H-1Bs, yet during that same time it sponsored a mere [2 percent] of its H-1Bs for permanent residence.

8058164,comment,8057401,8058050,2,0,spartango,,,"When you say that national intelligence communities are secretive, you&#x27;re absolutely right. So much so that they would certainly not share any sort of information with commercial/multinational airlines. It sounds ridiculous, given that lives are at stake, but it is important to consider their calculus (taking the US intel perspective for a moment):<p>Knowledge that rebels had active radar-guided SAMs would be derived from a handful of classified assets, from satellite to radar to drone to people. Adversaries to the US are meant to be unaware of these modalities (to prevent countermeasures), but you can bet they are all in use.<p>The challenge is that disclosure of any facts gleaned from classified systems potentially reveals their capabilities.<p>Now disclosure is a continuous spectrum, from &quot;there is a threat&quot; to &quot;here is a multispectral image of a launcher&quot;, so perhaps there is some shareable information. In considering that, you weigh the utility (external risk) of the information shared against its credibility (details), and the potential loss of capability incurred by disclosure. When we say &quot;loss of capability&quot;, in this case it may mean disclosing the capability to detect missile launches early, which represents a critical piece of US missile defense.<p>For a historical case study in this type of calculus, it&#x27;s worth looking into the disclosure of images during the Cuban Missile crisis. There, the US had to provide credible information that there was a threat in Cuba, and did so at the cost of the revelation of U-2 images.<p>By the way, this same calculus played into the US President&#x27;s wording when he spoke yesterday about the tragedy. Obama was careful to say little about how they knew where the missile came from.<p>Unfortunately, from the perspective of an intelligence agency, NDAs are insufficient to protect classified assets, especially where multinationals are involved. Anything that is disclosed would go through several levels of indirection, and would probably end up in a NOTAM (like the one prohibiting flight under FL320 in the region).",1405792374

America is wealthy compared to almost everywhere, and phenomenally wealthy compared to many of the places these H1B workers come from.&quot;<p>Your reasoning applies to immigration, not to H1B visas. If America is wealthy and should share its wealth with others, then it should have open borders. H1B visas bring in foreign workers on a temporary basis, tie them to a specific job, and therefore leave them in a precarious situation, unable to demand pay increases. If you believe that America should share its wealth via immigration, then you should be fighting for a more generous availability of green cards, not H1B visas.<p>About this:<p>&quot;The downvote button is not a disagree button.

You have to assume the the government is a hostile party, and has nation-state resources and police powers to apply to the task of taking your data.

Similar to the way in previous epochs groups like Muslim or Roman empires affected outcomes or took advantage of regional conflicts.<p>It is a crucible.  I believe that the biggest driver is still fossil fuels.  Yes, solar and other systems are rapidly replacing a portion of the energy demand, but still, the critical need for oil cannot be understated.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_consumption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_consum...</a>.  You can see that this is quite an unequal distribution.  The need to maintain that is what puts pressure on that region and causes regional animosities to be taken advantage of in order to move power over to groups siding with dominant forces.<p>Even though solar and other energy sources are gaining ground, the industrial reliance on fossil fuels is a much tougher nut to crack, and I actually believe that creating viable industrial production processes based on bio-fuels or significantly different chemistry is the key to &#x27;peace in the Middle East&#x27;.  Obviously, bad blood between groups going back thousands of years does not go away just because someone invented a non-fossil-fuel-based industrial precursor, but the motivation for stirring up those conflicts in order to further political power of one group gets reduced.<p>There are other aspects to this aside from fossil fuels.  The fire for the crucible is fueled generally by the global power struggle which has other aspects like currency domination.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_hegemony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_hegemony</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Great_Game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Great_Game</a>.<p>For some people, for example, those who read western media which is full of talk of local &quot;evil dictators&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;, framing things this way will be very controversial.  My next paragraph will probably be even more controversial for everyone.<p>I believe that hegemony and centralized control (at least on a physical regional level) could someday be supplanted by global cyber-states.  In other words, the borders are not dictated so much by the map or actual physical areas, but by alignments with global systems of political power and organization, connected by internets.  There will likely be multiple internets controlled by different global factions, since controlling these internets is key to controlling the global organizations.<p>Technologies like advanced 3d printing (eventually moving into the area of programmable matter), and free information flow may democratize force so that power over life and death, and therefore ultimate political control, moves from central authorities into the hands of individuals and more regional groups.  At the same time, this type of technology could enable the global super-cyberstates as it would enable any group with sufficient control of a net to nearly instantly muster military assets at any point around the world.<p>I can go so far as to frame all of this as a need for good tools and systems for knowledge management and securing human needs, with the two interacting.<p>One of the core problems for knowledge management systems is how to promote an efficient, integrated, holistic view of the system, while still providing a strong capability for the evolution and maintenance of divergent branches or systems which evolve in new and beneficial directions.  Or just, divergent branches which allow localized freedom in the knowledge graph, which may later lead in beneficial directions.<p>An example of this is different standards or platforms competing for dominance in technology.  Based on a certain platform of solutions and set of common assumptions, a set of new problems arises, and many different groups and individuals solve those problems in relative isolation.  In order to move on to solving the next set of problems, or for the overall group to gain the advantages of the new solutions in a way that integrates with previous efforts, a certain solution set is selected.<p>The particular process by which solutions are selected and integrated into the system, or multiple interacting systems, affects everyone working towards the advancement or maintenance of the systems greatly.<p>Github is a concrete example of this.<p>There seems to be a tendency towards a very small number of systems which exhibit high coupling and low cohesion.  But maybe that view is too mechanistic and low-level, and a higher level view which better incorporates abstraction has a different problem.<p>Creating an abstraction prunes redundant solutions but also often discards less generally relevant information that may however be important in certain circumstances.  Abstractions are powerful because their hierarchical structure allows individual nodes to leverage aggregate powers of branches.  This hierarchical structure is also a disadvantage though in terms of the reliance that leaves have on the integrity of each branch.<p>Compositional rather than hierarchical structures can provide the same power of abstraction without the brittleness and central-point-of-failure that hierarchies have.<p>It seems though that more compositional networked structures tend to converge towards what are effectively hierarchies.<p>Anyway, I think that there must be some tools or processes or perspectives that would provide for somehow more optimal evolutions of structures.  Probably some that are not discovered or in common use.  In case anyone read all of this and knows of some relevant links, please let me know.",1405790482

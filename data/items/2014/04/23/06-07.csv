7632568,comment,7632346,7632535,2,0,zaroth,,,"There are usage requirements for IP addresses now. I have to substantiate the allocation.<p>I think if ARIN wanted to, they could give everyone a year to &quot;substantiate their allocation&quot; and set the policy something like &quot;companies must return for reallocation any overallocations.&quot;<p>The risk of not returning an overallocation, well I&#x27;m not sure. ARIN certainly has teeth, and companies should simply be expected to correct these huge overallocations.<p>Just like the open source community comes together to solve serious problems, if we as a community enforced an ethical standard and some key people stood up raised this as an issue, I&#x27;m willing to bet ARIN could replenish a stockpile of IPv4 space.<p>So the question I&#x27;m asking is, since ARIN is empty, clearly they aren&#x27;t interested in keeping a stockpile of addresses.  Why not? I guess the more generous alternative is simply they have failed spectacularly at their stated goal.",1398236379

According to surveys, women are better at mathematical calculating, men are better at abstract mathematical thinking.<p>To summarize, to students reading this post, students who might not have decades of life experience to season one&#x27;s outlook, I must say that from a perspective in college, physics and psychology may appear to be equal in rank, but they aren&#x27;t:<p><a href=""http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2014/majors-that-pay-you-back"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report-2014/majors-th...</a><p><pre><code>   Majors by Salary Potential – Full List\n\n   ...\n\n   9.

Whatever that value is, in theory you would be willing to pay a portion of that for access to IPv4 address space.<p>Luckily supply is not really constrained, so much as it is controlled. You can always get more IPs if you need them, but the cost associated I think will continue to increase... until enough people not only just support IPv6, but actually abandon their IPv4 addresses.<p>When the only devices that your software or service is designed to run on all support IPv6, then there&#x27;s &quot;no point&quot; in having an IPv4 address. You almost have to get to the point where IPv4 is &quot;not worth the trouble&quot;. And we are very, very far from that point I think.

7632536,comment,7632094,7632094,30,0,Xcelerate,,,"> That&#x27;s because nearly all research into healthy aging has found that the key to a long, happy life is not diet or exercise but strong social connections – that is, friendships. Loneliness accelerates age-related declines in cognition and motor function, while a single good friend has been shown to make as much as a 10-year difference in overall life expectancy.<p>This makes me sad :(  My mother passed away from cancer in 2001 after 16 years of marriage to my father.

He doesn&#x27;t socialize much more than going to the coffee shop on weekend mornings.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to do about this; I live three hours away and can&#x27;t visit every weekend, and my sister is getting married soon and moving away as well.  He&#x27;s not opposed to dating, but the last time he dated was nearly a decade ago, and I know he doesn&#x27;t want to date because of the sheer sadness he still feels from my mother&#x27;s death.  He has mentioned it would be really nice to have a companion though.<p>I need ideas.  Solitude isn&#x27;t a good way to spend the rest of one&#x27;s life, and I really want him to be happy.

Note that this code doesn&#x27;t compile though :) While I was initially fond of the latter, it&#x27;s been very painful to work with in practice and I don&#x27;t see it actually working, so I think that I&#x27;ll be testing out to see if I can rework the static functions to have a context. I think the hardest part is that I want to eliminate any need to have any static variables, but that means I have to store them all in a struct that requires Send to be fulfilled and thats more over head for programmers. In the near future, I will be looking into using the different parts of rust-http directly rather than implementing the server trait to see if I can gain any benefits from that :)",1398235316

If I understand how it works correctly, you can be working with one of three main kinds of arrays: slices with a known length, slices with an unknown length, or a growable vector. In the case of slices with a known length, ie: let a = [0]; then trying to say a[1] is a compile error since the compiler knows the length of the array at compile time, it will not let this code compile. In the case of an unknown length at compile time, the compiler cannot really help you here, but it will cause a task failure when you try to access out of bounds (since it does know the length at runtime, it checks to make sure that it is in bounds). This is similar to what happens when you are trying to access an element that doesn&#x27;t exist on growable vector as well.

A formal theory can be exploited to produce real probabilities, probabilities that can themselves be compared to experiment and possibly become the basis for a falsification.<p>>> But consciousness is by definition a non-material phenomenon, so that&#x27;s the wrong approach.<p>> This isn&#x27;t very useful.<p>It&#x27;s a critical point. If what&#x27;s being measured is ethereal, then a physical measurement is innately misleading. Consider our mathematical abilities, and consider the relation between consciousness and a propensity for mathematical thought. Solely to make a point I might suggest a consciousness gauge that relies on the ability to reason mathematically -- more math, more consciousness. Sort of like the famous mirror test, but at a higher level: a certain animal is conscious to the degree that it can reason mathematically. But mathematics, and consciousness, are both nonmaterial properties, therefore (a) this makes a math scale an appropriate measure of consciousness, and (b) it creates yet another difficult, nonmaterial measure of consciousness.<p>If we instead measure the speed at which an animal solves a certain easily measured problem, the basis for many IQ tests over the years, that test will eventually be solved more efficiently by a computer. If we measure consciousness by the ability to pass some kind of Turing test, same answer.<p>My point? Tests of consciousness tend to be material quantifications of something non-material. These tests are easily passed by present and future computers, simulacra -- unless, of course, we begin to assign consciousness to computers. That&#x27;s an interesting approach, but it does lead to reasonable doubt about the basic premise that the human (or dolphin, or gray jay) brain is the seat of consciousness.<p>> The problem with the metaphysical types is that you propose some exotic mechanism simply because you can&#x27;t imagine how natural phenomena could give rise to consciousness.<p>It&#x27;s the other way around, exactly the other way around. The materialist position exists because it&#x27;s accessible to conventional experimental methods. It may turn out to be perfectly correct, I emphasize that, but it exists only because we don&#x27;t have the tools to correlate consciousness with other measures using some other approach, and even if we did, there might be no point to the exercise if it didn&#x27;t lead to objective evidence, evidence on which different observers agree, evidence on which most modern science depends.<p>> This is simply a failure of imagination on your part.<p>I hope you recognize the humor in that position. It is the materialist outlook that represents a failure of imagination. It is an intentional limitation of inquiry to make the outcome fit into conventional categories, into publishable experimental science. It&#x27;s why psychological research has the reputation it does.<p>Einstein&#x27;s brain wasn&#x27;t physically (materially) significantly different than the brains of many other men and women. Yet he produced results that (a) sprang from &quot;consciousness&quot;, indeed to many it represents a measure or criterion of consciousness, (b) arose in the realm of mathematics, clearly a Platonic realm, and (c) have no materialist explanation.<p>Think of all the remarkable outcomes of conscious behavior that aren&#x27;t correlated with a measurable material cause, that are orthogonal to material measures. Then think of all the ways we have of measuring consciousness that can be faked by a computer.<p>My point? It&#x27;s the materialist outlook that represents a failure of imagination, and it only exists because it allows a kind of faux science to address consciousness, as though the latter could realistically be reduced to material quantification.",1398233324

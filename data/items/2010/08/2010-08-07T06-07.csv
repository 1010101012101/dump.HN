1583194,comment,1582231,1582231,0,0,bl4k,,,"Google stop supporting a product that not many people used, and it jumps to a thousand upvotes and remains on top for over a day, attracting hundreds of comments.<p>The CEO of a top 5 IT firm resigns after admitting to inproprietaries and sexual harrasment, dropping almost 10% of the stock price (around 10B of market cap) and the story struggles to make the front page and doesn't attract many comments.<p>This is really big news, and I am surprised that it isn't being covered more and more in-depth. I think it is fair to say that a large portion of HN readers, and the general tech/startup blogosphere, have no idea how the IT world works, who this guy really was, what his job was etc. If this was Apple, the story wouldn't die for weeks. Enterprise and hardware make up a huge part of IT, it is just covered poorly.<p>(Edit: there was a lot of hype around wave, granted, I could probably find a better example of less-significant events that attract a lot of attention)",1281164173
1583193,comment,1582960,1582960,0,0,dtf,,,"This is (pop) evolutionary psychology, not psychoanalysis. Freud's reasoning on why men are driven to become entrepreneurs, magnates, architects, artists is that the boy, sensing that he has been robbed of the organs required to procreate internally, is driven to create externally to assuage his loss. It's the male equivalent of Freud's theory of ""penis envy"".",1281164147
1583192,comment,1582960,1583128,0,0,omarchowdhury,,,"I think what kiba and Beatrice Pang are saying is that it is <i>biologically ingrained</i> in the psyche of women to want children.<p>The same way a hot woman is universally attractive to heterosexual men. It's how we are. I guess my second point is a bit irrelevant but I'm adding on to what Beatrice is saying: much of our behaviors follow a certain template to ensure the continuation of the species, there's a special synergy between men and women.",1281163943
1583191,comment,1582402,1582402,0,0,makecheck,,,"I think the real value of the web is to give students free access to the nitty-gritty details of potential careers.  These details would not serve as a replacement for education (I feel that's impossible, since hands-on lab experience and access to expensive equipment, etc. are so important to competency).  Rather, they would help to ensure that students are embarking on a path that they're sure they want.<p>Some people spend a couple of years and thousands of dollars before discovering that their major isn't really what they thought it would be.  And by then, they're just unhappy; they have invested too much to turn back, and don't really have passion anymore.  I strongly suspect that a lot of people who do crappy work simply got into this kind of trap; if they'd had the chance to find out more about other jobs in detail, they may have made a different choice of major, and been much happier and more productive somewhere else.",1281163827

1583188,comment,1583183,1583183,0,0,jaaron,,,"I mention this event because it started with a couple of founders getting together for coffee last fall.  We had just been at a startup event in HK that was very US centric and sorta top down.  Dave McClure, who attended, suggested we build on that event with just some informal meetings between founders to help the community grow.  So for the next couple of months, we've been meeting at coffee shops every other week.  This built into planning a TechCrunch 50 style event and setting up a new co-working space (boot.hk).  All of this motivated, organized and driven by local startup founders.<p>If anyone has any questions about startups in Hong Kong, let me know.  Happy to share.  If you can attend, the Hong Kong BarCamp will be Sept 18th this year.<p>Tweets about the event are tagged #sus2010",1281163566

It's hard to present this kind of complex analysis of the behavior of a system to the tax payers for exactly this reason. The average person probably votes their conscience, not what makes the most sense from scientific studies, which are generally not widely published anyway.

While the electric field strength necessary to accomplish this is immense, to say the least, recent experimental advances have raised hope that lasers may soon achieve field intensities on the order of this very critical field intensity.</i><p>As a layman this seems to me to be the crux of the matter. First, there's the the energy costs required to generate a laser that will in turn generate anti-matter from the ""void"". Will the energy released by the anti-matter fuel cover the costs of generating the laser?<p>If so, this technique would also provide a way to generate a perpetual source of energy. The laser costs X energy but produces an explosion of >X energy. Who says this energy can only be used for propulsion? You could feed some of this energy back into the laser, covering the continuous operating cost of the laser, then dissipate or distribute the remaining energies.<p>Of course, I'm just a layman, so I might be completely off base on proposing this perpetual motion machine :)<p>There's also the problem of sequestration and storage. How do you keep the proton-antiproton pairs from immediately colliding with each other? Isn't this the basis of the fuel? Colliding matter/anti-matter pairs? For long-term storage how do you keep the anti-matter suspension intact until you're ready to ignite it?",1342648193

4263150,comment,4262242,4262675,26,0,jerf,,,"If you read up on the history of the era and combine that with a study of the real effects of nuclear bombs, it becomes evident that there was an uncoordinated, but nevertheless systematic, effort to grossly overstate the dangers of nuclear war. A game of ""Telephone"" [1] was played, where at each step the nukes got more dangerous. If nukes were as dangerous to the world as popular culture today imagines, there would be no popular culture; most people grossly underestimate the number of test explosions that were set off at various times. Once again, Wikipedia to the rescue: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests</a> :<p>""The United States conducted around 1,054 nuclear tests (by official count) between 1945 and 1992.... The Soviet Union conducted 715 nuclear tests (by official count)[3] between 1949 and 1990... France conducted 210 nuclear tests between February 13, 1960 and January 27, 1996...""<p>Fallout isn't as dangerous as it is commonly portrayed, the bomb's effects are often overstated on every dimension, etc.<p>But of course, who <i>really</i> wants to go out of their way to correct the record? A number of people reading this will find a strong emotional inclination to leap to the conclusion that this post is pro-nuclear-war advocacy or something. But the truth is that while nukes can't destroy the world or destroy the entire ecosystem (even ""nuclear winter"" is highly questionable, especially in light of subsequent experiences with high-atmosphere particles, such as in the Kuwait oil fires), they still <i>can</i> kill millions directly and effectively destroy civilization as we know it by wiping out potentially every major city in the world (and get a good bit of damage on the medium-sized ones, too), killing billions more. Perhaps it isn't so bad that the dangers are played up a bit. The real dangers they pose are much harder to understand than the Hollywood B-grade movie version in popular culture, but still quite bad.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers</a>",1342647750

Bosch didn't invent electric ignition for cars, he just transplanted the idea from Volta's glass pistol, whose spark in turn was delivered by Volta's ""pile"" (battery), the idea of which was inspired by Volta's friend who noticed that when he dissected frogs sometimes the frog's legs would jump right off the plate by the generated currents from the scalpel interacting with the metal base.

While some of the early tests were very unsafe, by the time of this test (1957), the dangers of radiation were well-known, so it wasn't a cowboy-type experiment like the early ones, and the planning would've computed the expected radiation dose and ensured it was safe.<p>The military did it as a publicity stunt to assuage public fears of nuclear-tipped air-to-air missiles by showing that even if they were used in a dogfight directly over a city, they wouldn't pose any risk to those on the ground. The volunteers were even supposed to not wear a helmet or hat to show that it was fine for normal people. If I recall correctly from having seen this discussed previously, they measured radiation doses received, and found that the highest doses (but still not at dangerous levels) were received by the pilots involved in the test, not the ground volunteers.<p>This was from the relatively short-lived era when several militaries were hoping to make a distinction between ""strategic"" nuclear weapons, the kind that blow up cities and would only be used in doomsday scenarios, and ""tactical"" nuclear weapons (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon</a>), small-yield varieties that would just be like very big regular weapons and could conceivably be used in a non-apocalyptic war. Due to a mixture of public opposition and fears of international chain reactions that might result from ""going nuclear"", though, that initiative failed, which is why you saw a transition back into really-gigantic conventional weapons in the 1990s, e.g. the MOAB (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_Blast_bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBU-43/B_Massive_Ordnance_Air_B...</a>).",1342645731

You can burn through energy and focus at very different rates depending on how you spend it. It's also not as measurable as time, which is why people like to just equate time to effort/focus, and then just measure effort based on time spent.<p>In reality, some people are better at spending their effort in short sharp bursts over a longer period of time, while other people prefer to spend it all once until a task is done or they run out of energy, and there's all sorts of people in between. This also highlights the importance of taking time to recharge, and making sure you have a reasonably balanced life.<p>I think this is the big reason for the success of some implementations of hammock driven development and paid company holidays in increasing the value generated by employees. In the end it's important not only to consider time spent, but also to consider productivity. A focus purely on time spent is what gives us 40-hour work weeks chained to a desk.

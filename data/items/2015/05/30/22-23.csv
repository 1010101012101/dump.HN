M was in no way forced to do anything and the way the story is presented is nearly as guilty as S in that she abused her sexual power for gain (undermining justice in the process) to free someone.

9632143,comment,9625622,9631667,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The toolset differences are a <i>huge</i> barrier to market penetration. It&#x27;s why technically superior, but architecturally different, products of the past were ignored to our loss. Itanium, with its advanced security, is a recent example. Not all are like that, though. There are a number that just protect pointers, do segments, do address space protection (see INTEGRITY-178B), or vary the granularity of the protection for legacy compatibility. These tend to support a modified UNIX/Linux kernel and/or GCC modifications. Things are otherwise the same. So, there&#x27;s potential in those.<p>I found the following looking into embedded use and what works with similar tools. This tagging scheme [1] integrates with RTEMS and C albeit with more complexity than some. The guarded pointers [2] from mid-90&#x27;s probably would work well with microcontrollers given embedded code is often fairly static, esp safety-critical schemes. The critiques shouldn&#x27;t apply as much except cost of extra bits. The SAFE architecture&#x27;s PUMP [3] does arbitrary policies with costs that <i>might</i> put it outside of microcontroller range (high end? mid-range?). One can even use the old Burrough&#x27;s model where 2 tags bits per word are used to ID pointers and code. Writes to either generate an interrupt for security system to approve based on context. Again, embedded is static enough that there should be no such interrupts in normal operation if pointer-arithmetic is avoided, right?<p>Feel free to give your thoughts on these in terms of microcontrollers or low-cost microprocessors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uidaho.edu/~/media/Files/orgs/ENGR/Research/CSDS/2014/A%20New%20Operating%20System%20for%20Security%20Tagged%20Architecture%20Hardware%20in%20Support%20of%20Multiple%20Independent%20Levels%20of%20Security%202014.ashx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uidaho.edu/~/media/Files/orgs/ENGR/Research/CSDS/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/pubs/asplos94.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/pubs/asplos94.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.crash-safe.org/assets/PUMP-ASPLOS-2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crash-safe.org/assets/PUMP-ASPLOS-2015.pdf</a>",1433026729

Either way, he exploited his power as sheriff and blackmailed MM for sex.<p>RH&#x27;s actions, on the other hand, while certainly misguided, are at least understandable, if he lives in a typical culture of masculinity, monogamy, and Victorian-era purity, where it&#x27;s embarrassing to be rescued by a woman and shameful for women to have sex. He was probably feeling emasculated after being rescued by in such a fashion, and took out his anger on MM. (Which is bad, of course, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worse than what the sheriff did).<p>Finally, RH&#x27;s &quot;abuse&quot; is left ambiguous, as opposed to the sheriff&#x27;s which is very much explicit.",1433026550

That favours people with the most time to put aside - and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot of wasted effort for the candidate who gets rejected.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s as fair as it should be.<p>We&#x27;re using anonymous interviews for all our positions (not just development), and it&#x27;s great to get a sense of personality without thinking about gender, age, race or anything else irrelevant.  When we turn people down, we don&#x27;t even know who they were.  I _think_ that&#x27;s a good thing for both sides.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pre-judge what&#x27;s happening with our process, but so far we&#x27;ve got through a load of interviews without stress, and got very strong impressions from these 30 minute initial chats.  Second interviews will start happening the week after next & I&#x27;ll write about it once we&#x27;ve got this batch of recruits through the door.",1433025794

He allows himself to be bribed with sex which could be seen as a mercy in a certain light. More importantly, he was good on his word to release Robin and Little John, as opposed to abusing his power even further. Basically, he could have done far worse than he did.<p>3.

Ingratitude coupled with abuse, and lack of empathy as to Marion&#x27;s motivations.<p>The claims:<p>> Such an emphatic rejection of ready-made values is probably partly camouflage.

If a non-savvy map user has a simple question, they’re unlikely to turn to Google Earth.<p>Anyhow, I think the “earth” view of Google Maps is a “let’s make something that looks cool in a 2 minute demo” gimmick, not a serious tool.

Its user interface is laggy and glitchy as heck, even on top-of-the-line current hardware. It’s impossible to look at either the arctic or antarctic head-on, as the rotation of the globe is strictly constrained.<p>More generally, orthographic projections have a place as a reference to compare maps to a view on a 3D globe, but they make it impossible to answer many kinds of questions because they involve severe distortions in any particular view, and it’s impossible to see more than about 40% of the globe at a time.

Conceptually there has been a lot of work done on Magical systems, both from a technical point of view and story point of view, very little of which seems referenced :-).<p>Typical RPG systems use magic either entirely, or mostly entirely, for combat. Meaning attacking and defending against attacks (physical and magical) which result in damage to the player or the opponent. And unlike Magic in books like the Harry Potter series where it has more of a &#x27;tool&#x27; nature (travel, lighting, retrieving things, fixing things, cleaning, Etc.)<p>That said, having dabbled in game design I have found that &quot;real world&quot; things like economics and physics express self contained and dynamically stable systems. That can be useful in the fantasy world given that one ever burning fire spell could burn everything in the game universe if there wasn&#x27;t something which prevented that from happening. So thinks like the inverse square law and conservation of (magical) energy really help out in keeping the game from becoming radically unbalanced.<p>When I read &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; by Niven I felt it was an interesting take on &#x27;magic as alternate scientific thing&#x27; and Zelazny&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Changling&quot; trilogy about magic in an alternate world an interesting &#x27;magic is where you find it&#x27; sort of system.",1433024170

They make a product that causes massive devastation to the environment through toxic lithium mining, and which is astonishingly expensive and can only be afforded by the ultra rich, and then only with subsidies paid for by the poor and middle class. Furthermore, these so-called cars have off the shelf Panasonic batteries that only last a few years before they have to be replaced at extravagent cost.<p>You call the reporter of the truth an &quot;absolute imbecile&quot; because using ad hominem arguments is the last refuge of a brain dead moron with no facts.",1433023342

I mostly use Matlab/Octave as a glorified graphing calculator (anything complicated I do in ROOT) so the startup time really irks me. That said, I also of course appreciate that it&#x27;s Free software.<p>And now that I realize that you&#x27;re a (the?) core dev, I should say thank you!",1433023282

One of the reasons we added the ability to move the finished archive to Drive was to allow users with unreliable internet connections to use the Drive Sync tool to sync the finished download down to their computer.  I know it is a little inconvenient but it should make it possible to download a large archive over an unreliable connection.<p>(I work on the Takeout team)",1433023271

I find very interesting how they solve different challenges.<p>I just learn a bit about them, but do not learn to speak, at least not enough to have the simplest conversation. But I understand how you could get more hooked into it and learn it and spend many hours with your toy language.<p>From all the unuseful hobbies people have, I do not think learning artificial languages is one of the worse.",1433023265

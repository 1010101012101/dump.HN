The extreme and current example is letting financial institutions supervise themselves. How to use computers is just one part of the problem.<p>Many things can run unattended - but under what circumstances should they? What are the necessary safeguards? Pilots on commerical airplanes don't do much flying, they are onboard to make sure everything is safe and works.<p>Eventually it's all about acceptable risk. We already know automated trading can be dangerous. But the danger lies in bad human assumptions, bad human models and the widespread idea that somehow no human being remains responsible.<p>As a complete aside - I worry whenever I hear cheerful talk about ""the drones we send to kill militants"". That kind of convenient and unaccountable power over life and death in other countries is both morally suspect and open to abuse. Killing by remote is still killing and relying on technological quick-fixes to ""solve"" terrorism is a dangerous strategy.",1229640543

And checking for bombs in their shampoo.<p>Devices for monitoring vital signs just did not happen, far as I know.<p>As for the rest of the computers on our body, it seems people prefer to have one broadly capable device for information, computation, entertainment, and communication, which is the cellphone (with iPhone best exemplifying the ideal of a single device with a broad range of capabilities).

Take for instance the hippocampus. Sure, we can simulate circuitry with precision but that doesn't explain memory formation and retrieval. More ""artificial"" approaches can help to explain systems from the top down even as biological constraints are more rigid from the bottom up. Both modeling approaches are likely to meet somewhere in the middle. The computational shortcuts in the more abstract models (e.g. backprop) are really just a shorthand to allow investigators to focus on less biologically-driven details or those that are not now understood in biological terms.<p>For instance, I know of one group using analytic techniques from social networks to correlate brain regions in fMRI data. Is the brain a massive social network? I don't think any one would say that literally.

I've met quite a few people at startup mixers and events and such who were working on clones of things that I'd never even heard of.

However, today every mainstream website is optimized for the mouse+keyboard.<p>My idea is to get ahead of the curve and create user experiences for all the major mainstream web verticals (such as Email, social networking, news, search, etc..) that are designed primarily for use with touch.  For verticals that have a high switching cost (such as mail and social networking), instead of trying to build from scratch, the focus should be on a front end that pulls from an existing service (i.e. pulls from gmail pop or Facebook connect). Users could choose the verticals that they use on a daily basis, and each service would be available from different tabs.  The core UX elements would be consistent across all services, and would be optimized for use with a touch screen.<p>If anyone's interested in hearing more or maybe hacking out a prototype with me over break, feel free to contact me at kleneway@hotmail",1229637940

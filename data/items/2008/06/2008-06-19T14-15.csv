I could almost pin names of people I know to each mistake.<p>As I hacker, I love #11 the most: <i>Accepting that it's ""not possible"" too easily rather than finding a way.</i>  Whenever I hear that, I become that much more determined.  My mentor once taught me, ""We can always find a way to do the right thing.""  The words ""find a way"" still get that Pavlovian response from me. </wipes slobber from keyboard>",1213887564

The MO of modern American medicine is to sucker in trusting patients and write prescriptions and perform procedures at great cost that empirically do not work.  The doctors are feeling frustrated because the jig is up.  There are too many of them and society can't afford the con game anymore.",1213887105

(Travel sounds like fun, until you realize that business travel consists of the insides of hundreds of airports, limos, hotel rooms, and conference rooms and not much else. And it really is <i>continuous</i> -- four days out of every week, except for the lucky folks who make it into the coveted Wall Street office where the commute is only a few blocks. Ever wonder why every ad at every airport seems to be targeted at management consultants? Wonder no more...)<p>Lots and lots and lots of diplomacy and office politics (which is your primary task). You'll wear out a lot of ties.<p>Not to mention the first-order problem: There is a right time and a wrong time to get that job. The time right after you get your MBA is a good time. Thanks to a fad (which, I believe, began in the nineties) for hiring fresh new Ph.D.s, the time right after you get your Ph.D. is a good time. I'm not sure that there are many other good times. I'm guessing that ""right after you burn out on medicine"" is not a good time.",1213886867

It was an attempt to bring some balance and professionalism to the discussion. The NY Times writer actually brought up an interesting legal issue (the ""Hot News"" doctrine, which other observers subsequently dismantled in the AP/blog case) but what apparently angered Arrington was the NY Times mildly criticizing his anti-AP post, by suggesting it wasn't constructive.",1213886410

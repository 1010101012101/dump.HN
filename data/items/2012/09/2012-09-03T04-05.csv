4469138,comment,4468057,4468999,5,0,tzs,,,"Suppose the article was about the greatest boxers of the 20th century, and it talked about the Arab boxer Muhammad Ali. Would you object to someone pointing out that Ali was not Arab, but rather an American Muslim? His being Muslim is relevant not because it is his religion, but because it explains why an American of his era has such a foreign name--he changed his name when he converted to Islam.<p>Same thing is going on here. The article says al-Khwarizmi was an Arab. He was actually a Persian who followed the Arab religion (Islam), which probably explains the Arab-appearing aspects of his life and work.<p>Does it matter if he was Arab or Persian? Some might argue that all that matters is what he discovered. The counter argument is that by mentioning things like nationality, ethnicity, religion, etc., in these kind of articles, it helps reinforce the idea that science transcends national borders, ethnic boundaries, religion, and so on. I believe I read something by Asimov once where he said that was the reason he always included the nationality of scientists he wrote about.",1346647566

For high to handle the error, it must either do its job without any help from medium or somehow change things so calling medium will work and call it again. [...] The second option--patching things up and retrying--is tricky; for high to be able to change the state of the world so a second call into medium won't end up causing an error in low, it'd need an unseemly knowledge of the inner workings of both medium and low, contrary to the notion that each function is a black box.</i><p><Devils advocate><p>But if there was some way for medium to recover by itself, it had the option to handle the exception on the way back up the call stack and then to restart the computation that called low, hopefully under improved conditions.<p>Control will therefore return to high only if medium doesnt itself know how to handle the error. At that point, the entire computation for which medium was responsible has failed.<p>Assuming the system as a whole uses reasonable functional decomposition and modular design, since exceptions have limited value under other circumstances anyway, shouldnt any context that was known only within medium be irrelevant to any recovery action taken at highs level?<p></Devils advocate>",1346647402

For a desktop there are certain design choices to be made. If one wants to target users, then one should use sensible defaults and try to hide complexity. If one wants to target hackers, then one should have a lot of easily accessible APIs, preferable accessible via a CLI. That means exposing complexity. For the two groups consistency in a UI does mean two different things, users want a ""intuitive"" UI, whatever that means. Hackers want a UI which is based on principles, such that one can deduce the proper operation, even if it is complicated and takes some time to learn in the beginning. 
The list could go on, but in short: I have different needs on my desktop than the average user. And if Linux would become a sensible desktop OS for the average user, then I would likely move to BSD (or Plan9 or whatever).",1346646671

But where this argument is flawed, is that protection from being copied is not only centered around the patent system. There are multiple ways you can protect your inventions, through trade secrets, supply chain efficiency that nobody else can reproduce, through a software environment which is worth more in its whole than the sum of its parts.<p>We know Apple is already using all the above techniques to protect their business. They have an excellent supply chain, they obviously have preferential trade partners which enable them access the new technologies first before anyone else, and they have a iOS system which is well rounded for its purpose.<p>Net, they really do not need to leverage their patents protection. That could be an indication that they do not think they are going to be very innovative down the road, and therefore they just want to keep competitors as far as possible until they pull their act together again... or that they have too many lawyers with too much time on their hands to investigate how much harm they could do with claims based on air and smoke.<p>When a company resorts to such practices, it is usually not a good sign.",1346645963
4469082,comment,4468057,4468057,4,0,ten_fingers,,,"Hmm, let's see:  One of the algorithms is the fast Fourier transform (FFT).  It is sometimes described as a form of matrix factorization and multiplication.<p>Another algorithm is Dantzig's simplex algorithm for linear programming:  It is basically just elementary row operations much as in Gauss elimination on a, usually, vastly 'under determined' system of linear equations.  The math for the simplex algorithm is mostly nicely presented via matrix theory.<p>A third algorithm in the list is the QR algorithm for finding eigenvalues.<p>So, of the 10 algorithms, at least three are closely related to just matrix theory.  Amazing.<p>Then, for computer science I would add an observation:  A few days ago a venture firm principal asked me about my project, ""So you have an algorithm?"".  I had to respond, ""Well, yes, but by itself an algorithm doesn't have much to recommend it and, thus, doesn't mean much."".<p>Well, this list of 10 algorithms supports my observation:   For a problem as complicated as those solved by the 10 algorithms in the list, an algorithm by itself doesn't mean much, really doesn't mean anything.  Instead, to take any such algorithm seriously, we need something we can take seriously and logically prior to the algorithm.<p>Well, as in the 10 algorithms, what is prior is just some applied math, typically with theorems and proofs.  Then due to the theorems and proofs, we take the applied math seriously.  Then we take the algorithm seriously because and only because it is a careful implementation of the data manipulations in the applied math.  So, net, what is really crucial for such an algorithm is the logically prior applied math.<p>Of course, at times we can proceed without any prior applied math and work just with an algorithm that we got, say, from just heuristics.  Then we may be able to take the algorithms seriously after a lot of empirical testing.<p>So, here's my point:  For reasonably complicated problems, the key is some applied math, and we take a corresponding algorithm seriously only because of the logically prior  applied math.<p>Or, computer science:  The most important work with algorithms is work with logically prior applied math complete with theorems and proofs.  Work with algorithms without such prior applied math is close to hopeless.<p>Venture firms and limited partners:  If an entrepreneur has some crucial, core 'secret sauce' in running code that can be called an 'algorithm', what is crucial (prior to already having a financially successful company based on that code) is the corresponding applied math, not the 'algorithm' and not just the code.<p>Information technology entrepreneurs:  If your business is trying to solve a serious problem with an algorithms and some corresponding code, then don't start with the algorithm and, instead, start with some applied math.<p>Computer science students:  If you want to do good work with algorithms, study appropriate topics in a math department, not 'algorithms' in a computer science department.<p>Computer science professors:  Algorithms are crucial to your field, but your approach to algorithms skipping prior applied math complete with theorems and proofs is bankrupt, with no good reason to take any such algorithm seriously, and will lead to a long walk on a short pier and blocked progress for your field.  What's just crucial for your interest in algorithms is in the math department and not in your department.  Sorry 'bout that!",1346645943

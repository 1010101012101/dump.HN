How about we leverage this stuff for ""Minority Report"" type interfaces with 50"" flat screen TVs?  How about rear projection?  Imagine collaborative picture or movie editing over the net?  Can stuff like this be leveraged for pair programming?  How about animated CRC cards which can execute and animate their functionality?  Such things have been possible for awhile now, appearing in places like TED.  Natal and the dropping price of big TVs can make them easily accessible to small and mid-sized companies.",1243920296
637403,comment,637084,637084,0,0,cellis,,,"Right now I am using the new IO Developer Conference HTC. Gotta say it is pretty slick. Being a game developer, i can't wait to develop a game for it. Does it compare with the iphone, with apple's brand cachet, accelerometer, and nonstop media attention? No. Still, it's better than my now broken Blackberry, and has the feel of a PSP. Maybe Android has a chance.<p>I for one, was really hoping that <i>Microsoft</i> came with a handheld competition for the iPod Touch. From what i can see, the Zune HD isn't it. The extent that it lends itself to game development seems to be incredibly lackluster and half-hearted, and i think this is for two reaons: 1) Microsoft doesn't want to officially dilute the xbox brand with a Zune PSP clone because they don't have a mobile game strategy yet (it's Microsoft, it takes time!), and 2) they're still hoping that they can claim some market share in the MP3 market, which seems a horrible plan, but then so did the xbox...",1243920294

637396,comment,619110,621093,0,0,Josh017,,,"That piece you linked by Cosma Shalizi ‘g is a statistical myth’ is incorrect.<p>1. The main thrusts of his argument is that test data do not statistically support a g-factor. Gould tried to discredit g but his argument argument was statistically incompetent (for a statistican’s critique see Measuring intelligence: facts and fallacies by David J. Bartholomew, 2004). Shalizi’s criticism is incredibly sophisticated, but likewise incorrect. In a nutshell, Shalizi is trying to argue around the positive correlations between test batteries. If those correlations didn’t exist, his argument would be meaningful. However, these intercorrelations are one of the best documented patterns in the social sciences.<p>2. Cosma Shalizi misrepresented Spearman and his two factor model. The author tried to present Spearman as ignorant of group factors (he should have called them out as such or noted that they are from the second stratum). The fact is that Spearman gave up on the two factor model and accepted group factors. The fact beyond that is that the predictive validity of group factors typically appears in the range from (and including) zero to about 4%. In other words, the two factor model is not rigorously correct, but it captures virtually all of the practical validity of any test.<p>For a discussion of neurological correlates with g see this discussion by Professor of Neurology at UCLA Paul Thompson:<p><a href=""http://www.loni.ucla.edu/~thompson/PDF/nrn0604-GrayThompson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loni.ucla.edu/~thompson/PDF/nrn0604-GrayThompson....</a>",1243919882

637392,comment,635484,637166,0,0,anamax,,,"Not at all.  In most urban and suburban regions, there are already several schools that are ""close enough"", and they typically have several classes for each grade.<p>> If you have two schools, one competently run, one incompetently run, you wind up with a good school that's impossible to get into and a school where you're screwed.<p>Nope.  Someone says, ""hey demand, here's some supply"" and opens a new school.  They start small, a couple of classes is ""big enough"", and the crappy school starts losing students.  When they lose enough, the space that they were occupying becomes empty at exactly the same time as a new school needs more space.  (No, you don't need all of the standard ""big school"" facilities to start a school.)<p>Yes, someone goes out of biz.

So, these abstract concepts fall into this abstract network of concepts.<p>For the word politics one might be teaching children at a summer camp.  While teaching them one may notice the kids have fallen into a popularity hierarchy.  When recounting the kids social structure one could describe struggles over their social order as fights amongst clicks or the kids politics.  Whichever description comes up first, and depending on what lesser connotations or more desirable.<p>That's the way I believe it works, but I'm not sure I've conveyed it very well.

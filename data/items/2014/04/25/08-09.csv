I&#x27;d previously thought very positively about going to work for Apple. Not so anymore. To me, the fact that Tim Cook&#x27;s voice isn&#x27;t clearly heard, completely rejecting this sort of practice, issuing a public apology on behalf of Apple, and ensuring to compensate employees by more than a few thousand dollars each - Is just too big of a de-motivator.<p>We need the CEOs to clearly voice their accountability, and their plans to prevent this from happening again, the sooner the better.",1398416371

To someone who may be feeling overwhelmed by the learning curve inherent with transitioning from small academic or recreational coding projects to real-world environments such dynamics could be very demoralizing. Anecdotally, men who stay in tech tend to have a high tolerance for it, but it&#x27;s secondary to the actual practice of coding and people who are feeling less confident don&#x27;t need to worry about competing in these games. Of course if someone is working on a real-world codebase they have to know what they&#x27;re doing, but learning from peers does not need to alienate anyone, at least in principle.",1398416274

Filling stations in most countries already follow that proven business model.<p>* These charging stations have solar panels on the roof, so they presumably already have the necessary inverters and whatever other infrastructure to pump electricity back to the grid. Tesla could make some deals to put panels up on nearby buildings who could save on capital costs by just piggybacking off Tesla. They could become a power utility company over time.<p>* Teslas are quite expensive, so Tesla owners (and therefore drivers) are generally affluent, which are the kind of customers local businesses would want to attract. So having a charging station nearby could be something malls might even pay for or want to subsidise. Similarly the land around a supercharger station in what is otherwise &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; could become significantly more valuable, so if Tesla purchases extra cheap land around stations placed along interstate highways they could stand to make quite a bit of money selling that to property developers afterwards.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is if Tesla plays their cards right, then Tesla cars could be like giving away razor handles for cheap.",1398415944

Nothing forever.<p>Apparently everyone else has been &quot;hassled&quot; endlessly for years to give their name to Google. They already know who you are. You should be appreciative of the transparency. Type in the name. It immediately sorts everything out for you. Google needs to keep moving forward as a company and with their products.

It can be used by my dentist to fill my teeth, it can be used to conduct electricity, as well as do other things. Then - it is also scarce, easily transferable, fungible, verifiable. Thus it makes a good currency. But underneath all of that there is value. Bitcoin has no value. It&#x27;s why the price can halve in five months. If gold&#x27;s price halved in five months (of course that would not happen) electronic manufacturers would buy gold like crazy and the price would go up.</i><p>But gold actually <i>does</i> suffer very similar huge declines in value[1], in similar time frames: 50% in less than 1 year in the early 1980s, 30% in 9 months last year. (The <i>actual</i> &#x27;loss&#x27; was much larger, because the total &#x27;market cap&#x27; of all gold is currently about 1000x that of bitcoin).<p>Gold is prone to these huge swings in value precisely because its &#x27;useful value&#x27; is a small fraction of the market price. The intrinsic value is generally estimated at below 15% of the price[2].<p>Therefore, the main factors influencing gold&#x27;s price are not industrial and commercial use, but speculation, as well as transferability, fungibility, and verifiability -- in this it is quite similar to... guess what?

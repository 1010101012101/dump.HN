While I'm sure Finland is a nice place for many things, it looks too cold and flat for my tastes.  Also, the language is supposedly not very easy, and even though most people probably speak english well, it's always a plus to be able to integrate as much as possible.  <p>Anyway, that's just my personal take on it, which comes down to my tastes, not anything objectively wrong.",1192798752
70278,comment,70169,70169,0,0,edw519,,,"Sorry, but I have the same reaction to any ""programming language"" argument, no matter how eloquent: so what?<p>90% of your code should either be generated or copied from standard templates.  I've put over 2500 new programs into the library in the past couple of years, yet I don't remember the last time I wrote a program from scratch.<p>I, too, am a stickler for details, but I let the compiler (or interpreter) do its job.  Why worry about nanoseconds when I have users running the asylum?<p>",1192798554

70275,comment,70149,70165,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Please take this as constructive, because I'm speaking from the voice of experience here.<p>\n""I told by those whom I show it to, that it is an industry changing concept!"" -- this phrase is a red flag for me. (Another big red flag phrase is ""if we only capture x% of the market..."") I've had applications like that too. I would just be careful that you base how cool your idea is on one thing: number of active users. People can say all kinds of great and wonderful things about you and your app; and they will. But it all boils down to users. If you got 'em, doesn't matter what people say one way or another.",1192798460

70272,comment,70164,70164,0,0,brlewis,,,"It would have to work like this:<p>(1) You send a $100.00 deposit in advance of your application.<p>(2) YC ticks off boxes next to a stock set of sentences that describe their impressions based on your application.<p>(3) If 3 months go by and you haven't contacted them to argue about it, you get your deposit back.<p>Otherwise they would have no way of dealing with the torrent of two-way conversations that would ensue.  They're evaluating hundreds of applications; they can't deliberate over each one like a jury.",1192797559

70270,comment,70209,70209,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I liked the advice, but I couldn't help feeling a little peeved by the continuing ""yc news readers are a cult"" thread.<p>\nI mean, come on, there are obviously a lot of people who have big dreams and look at YC as an easier way of getting to them, and yes, deadlines and tests bring out the neurosis and suck-ups in people, but this talk of cult-dom ALSO has a strange narcissistic quality about it which is just as bad.<p>\nIf I thought the board was too cultish I wouldn't participate. Geesh -- on one side we get the hype of how great YC is, how it's all milk and goodness. On the other side there's a significant sour grapes contingent. For those who have already made it through or have an interview, congrats! For those who have not, it's not the end of the world! If this site wants to be useful to the hacker community, the board has to be, well, useful. I understand it got a little freaky over the past couple of days, but having people tell me I'm part of a cult is not a way to keep me around. I'm here for the other hackers -- YC is just the facilitator for that.",1192797325

70264,comment,70164,70246,0,0,jonathan,,,"I couldn't agree more, but: <p>1) You can't just ignore YC's decision regarding your project, especially when you believe that your webapp will revolutionize the Web in some ways. These people are highly experienced profesionals:if you haven't caught their attention, get back to work because something key is missing.   <p>2) YC is not like any other funding cycles... we are talking about mentorship here as opposed to financial back-up. Of course there are plenty of ways to raise money, but very few to get strong expertise.   ",1192796820

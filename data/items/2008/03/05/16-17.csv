Would your employer give you an extra 30 hours a week off because they found your startup idea interesting? No, so don't give them an extra 30 hours of work for free either.<p>It'd be different if you had equity or some further promise of long term benefit.",1204735442

The only reason you work five weekdays is to seem professional.<p>At a <i>startup</i> you should work whenever you feel like it (which is hopefully seven days a week starting at 11pm and going til dawn, with copious amounts of caffeine and loud music).

Suddenly the deal isn't so attractive.<p>I worked four 10's for about a year, and I can say that you just get stir crazy by the end of the day, and you don't get any more/less done than an 8 hour day. If a four day week meant 32 hours, then I could see the benefit, but to a company, that just says ""20% less work will be done."" If you try to argue that the same work will be done, they will ask why you are goofing off 20% of the time.<p>As for staggering schedules, I'm with you.

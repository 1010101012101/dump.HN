Imagine how much more convenient it would be to have that just built into your vision.  Imagine virtual PC terminals, wherever you are.  Imagine a massive virtual TV in your house...  Anywhere in your house.  Or on the bus.  Or anywhere.<p>I watched an anime (Dennou Coil) that really made me see the  possibilities of AR.  Once we get to that point, I think there will be massive changes in our society.<p>TVs and PCs for instance.  Right now, we think of them as a physical object that displays video, etc.  But they don't -need- to be a physical object.  (Well, the processor does, but it doesn't have to be where we can see it.  Or even in our house.)<p>Your AR glasses would be your tv, phone, radio, internet connection, and more...  And they will probably blend together so we don't think of them like that any more.",1306321851

Two things in terms of feedback - the name socialtrade implies that there is some kind of social aspect of the app, I couldn't see any? I like the red slider / window for the time period at the bottom but it wasn't immediately obvious that was what it did. Perhaps some way of showing that the red slider is linked with the view the user sees would be useful (in design terms maybe some color coordination or make the main view look like an enlarged version of the slider).",1306321763

No, there were far too many variables involved that were not within his control.</i><p>Well, yes, I can agree nobody can completely know or control the future. One may become terminally ill, or the Earth may be hit by a meteor at any time. However, that was not the argument made by the author. It was that none of us knows what we're doing. He seems to suggest we have little control over the outcomes which we do see, saying things like Nobel Prize winners are ""winging it"", as if they have the same understanding as anyone else (in this case none) when it comes to their expertise. I find that highly disconcerting.<p>If we imagine a chess match, where we know the duration will be a few hours, and the fitness of the players will not be compromised for the game duration, we can understand the winning or losing outcome is entirely in the hands of the players. If we further imagine the best chess player in the world accepts this match, and both players fully intend to win, if the best player wins would you agree it is because he (or she) does know what he (or she) is doing?",1306321210

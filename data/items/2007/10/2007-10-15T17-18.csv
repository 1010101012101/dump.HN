68108,comment,68056,68056,0,0,zandorg,,,"My problem with the article is that it's not really theoretically useful, it's just a case for one particular program.<p>Writing large programs in C, I rarely see the need to optimise program size - I'm more interested in execution time. Even so, with thousands of lines of code, the executable is typically < 200kb, which would run on an Amiga, never mind a PC.<p>I think this article is slightly outdated as we don't run 64kb 8-bit machines anymore.<p>My last comment is that you could use an executable 'packer' which uncompresses at runtime, and that's far easier than his methods.

68106,comment,68001,68095,0,0,Caligula,,,"I think it has to do with the dominance of american culture that is changing every aspect of their lives.<p>You mentioned Jet Li, Jackie Chan.  They are more known internationally for their American movies than anything they made in HK.  <p>Also Chinese food is American.  The food you would have at an American Chinese restaurant has little in common with what you would experience in China.  The same American Chinese food was exported to France.  So its more American than anything else.<p>The martial arts instructors you mention exist largely because of Hollywood.  <p>The reason people dislike America is because its the wealthiest, most powerful nation on earth that can do whatever it wants regardless of what other nations think, and it does.",1192470741

68101,comment,68001,68095,0,0,corentin,,,"First, let's get this clear: as far as I know, we only have two cases of McDonald's restaurants attacks in France. One non-violent, symbolic dismantlement by leftist leader Jose Bove and one bomb attack by right-wing independendists in Brittany (it killed one person).<p>As far as I'm concerned, I mostly listen to US music, read US authors and watch US movies so basically I can't speak against your culture (well, OUR culture that is). It's so much rich and broad than what we have here. And most french people (secretly) agree; but they're way too proud to admit it.<p>What europeans and basically the rest of the world really hate is your leaders. Not that ours are better, but at least they don't use massive fire power against other countries (I'm talking about western europe here; Russian leaders are certainly as crazy as the hawks in Washington).<p>Oh, by the way: french people don't really like China in fact; they blame it for ""stealing"" our jobs.

68095,comment,68001,68082,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"The spread of pop culture is one of the reasons that many anti-American zealots latch onto as justification.  So yes, Schwarzenegger, Michael Jackson, McDonald's and Starbucks, they all have a great deal to do with the perceived American cultural hegemony.  As Jet Li, Jackie Chan and, foolish as it may seem, Chinese restaurants, all have a great deal to do with Chinese cultural hegemony.<p>The question that confuses me is this.  Why worry ONLY about American cultural hegemony, when CLEARLY the Chinese cultural hegemony is also an issue?  Why worry ONLY about American cultural hegemony, when Japanese cultural hegemony is also an issue?<p>I maintain that there is something subtle here that we are somehow missing.  There HAS to be.  Why do the French blow up McDonald's and not the restaurants in the Chinese section of Paris over by Le Marais?  There are as many instructors of Chinese martial arts in Munich as there are hip hop clubs.  Why single us out?  There are MORE girls playing with Tomagotchis than there are listening to Hannah Montana.  Why does she need so much more security?<p>Everything you wrote in your post as touching China is (somewhat) factual.  Yet most non-Americans consider the United States and Iran to be the prime threats to global peace. Why?<p>In short, what I am saying is that none of this makes sense to me.  That this situation is very disconcerting.<p>If there are non-Americans reading this thread, I would REALLY like your opinion on these matters.",1192469081

Tried various word processors first (MS Word, Open Office, ThinkFree Office, Neo Office) and with all of them I spent 90% of the time just trying to format block quote code segments, leaving me with little time for actual content.  Formatting the code snippets in LaTeX was a breeze.  The only think that got a little annoying was tables that spanned over multiple pages, but that's a reasonable price. ",1192467605

That&#x27;s billions of human beings wasting hours either changing all their passwords or having their money, identities, medical records, and more stolen because they didn&#x27;t. Having their accounts hijacked. For all we know totalitarian governments have already exploited this to monitor citizens and torture or kill them.<p>If that isn&#x27;t enough, how about goto fail? All the IIS exploits in v4/5? Various Windows RPC overflows, WMF overflows, SQL Slammer, et al? How many billions in damages have been caused by stack smashing and buffer overflows? How many millions of hours of manpower wasted cleaning up after these errors?

Furthermore the C standard library has been proven turing-complete for ROP gadgets in the presence of a buffer overflow. So no matter what you do, the presence of a single stack smash is enough to allow code execution, subject to payload size limits and execution time.<p>At some point we have to admit C is no longer acceptable. Not for libraries, not for drivers, not for operating systems. It has to go.<p>All the performance benefits ever derived from writing everything in C has been more than erased, by orders of magnitude, by the damage caused from even simple innocent mistakes.<p>Software allows us as programmers to greatly magnify our impact on the world; we like to think of that in positive ways.

True competition is prevented by design, and it takes 5 years to open up something as basic as the keyboard. How many more years until browser is opened up? 5 more?<p>It&#x27;s an interesting move as far as platforms go, but I know that it&#x27;s no where near what I want from a platform.

In particular, they don&#x27;t take into account natural things we have in practice: similarities in the structure of the actions, correlations in rewards across rounds, and the ability to precompute without measuring your regret against the results.<p>There are some new research directions that do each of these, though. People are now starting to impose metrics on the actions so that &quot;closer&quot; actions have more correlated rewards. They have also been doing a lot of work on &quot;contextual bandits&quot; in which every round comes paired with a context (i.e. browser type, information about past searches, etc), and relationships among the contexts can be leveraged. And finally, there is a model of &quot;pure exploration,&quot; in which you&#x27;re given some fixed (but unknown) amount of time to prepare, and the recommender you come up with when that period ends is judged into the future of how it would perform.<p>I don&#x27;t have a lot of intuition about which algorithms/settings are the best for which situations, but if you&#x27;re interested in this kind of thing you check out the work of John Langford, Peter Auer, Sebastien Bubeck, and the many others in this field.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/10/28/optimism-in-the-face-of-uncertainty-the-ucb1-algorithm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/10/28/optimism-in-the-face-of-unce...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2013/11/08/adversarial-bandits-and-the-exp3-algorithm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2013/11/08/adversarial-bandits-and-the-...</a>",1401736287

I know I could tackle it, but it&#x27;s been hard to take the plunge.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Swift yet, but from what I&#x27;ve seen it looks very exciting.

7835212,comment,7834420,7835082,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"You might prefer to drive the shorter distance, but that&#x27;s not a realistic option.  Car-centric infrastructure tends to take up a lot of space.  The wide multi-lane streets and seas of parking lots you get in communities where driving is the primary mode of transportation massively increase the amount of land area needed to provide the same amount of services, which in turn greatly increases the actual distance being covered.  Last time I lived in the &#x27;burbs, the nearest grocery store was 5 miles away, and accessible only by roads with speed limits of 45mph+.  Walking or riding a bike to buy a loaf of bread simply wasn&#x27;t an option.<p>Whereas part of the reason why it&#x27;s common for people to not own cars (or own fewer than one car per adult household member) in more walkable communities is that it&#x27;s simply not practical - cars take up a lot of space that can&#x27;t be used for other things, and making a community dense enough to permit easy walkability doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of space left over the swaths of 200 square feet that it takes to temporarily store a car that isn&#x27;t currently being driven.  So the laws of supply and demand place those spaces at a premium.",1401735663

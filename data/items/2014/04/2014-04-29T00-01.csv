7664188,comment,7663081,7663081,5,0,tsunamifury,,,"I sit on the boards of two Journalism schools and attended the  top Masters program just before the journalism crash of 2009. I am on these boards mostly because both schools think that some guy in Silicon Valley has insight into what journalism students should be doing.  Its not true.<p>The problem was that massive disruption of print media really came to a head due to the great recession, when low media buys plus a real uptick of traction from ad networks put a final nail in a lot of print journalists careers.<p>Looking back its easy to think if they were more tech savvy they could have somehow survived -- but thats just not the case.  Tech and journalism are more closely related than ever, and specifically scripted languages and knowledge of markup (CSS and JS Libraries) can improve the final product&#x27;s production quality, but journalists are not programmers no should they be.  Its similar to saying journalists should know how to roll their own print presses in the 50s -- its not their job.<p>The problem lies more in the fact that we simply can&#x27;t fund journalists to do their job anymore.  We charge them with both doing investigative reporting, staying neutral and coming up with a sustainable business model for it -- and you know what? Its just too much to ask. Local news stations are slowly dying out, local newspapers are already mostly thinned out and upstarts like Patch (flawed as it was) were not able to fund real journalistic work.<p>After a few years going back and forth on this I have come to believe that a BBC like model in the US would do the nation great deal of good.  Funding journalists to do their job and keep up the good work without pressuring them to make compromises is essentially to keeping voters informed.<p>I hope we can get over our mindset that all things need to be privatized at some point in the near future and begin funding PBS, NPR, and local news to keep doing what they are doing.",1398732893

More often than not, I am still looking for may keys/wallet/jacket or brushing my teeth when the car gets here.  I imagine an autonomous car service would be even faster, as car availability could be highly tuned to demand (Lyft and Uber are using comparatively crude methods of demand/availability management, surge pricing).<p>As others have mentioned, the car-sharing model works best in urban areas, and no one is suggesting that we ban individuals from owning cars.  But I will also add that we have spent the last 100 years building infrastructure and public spaces to accommodate for a car-centric society, but this has had a negative impact on people who prefer other forms of transportation.  Public transportation is severely underfunded and inadequate in most places, pedestrians and bikers are getting mowed down by reckless drivers, tons of public land is being poorly utilized as parking space, and our air is getting polluted to unprecedented levels.  Your &quot;peace of mind&quot; comes at a high cost to the rest of society.  Autonomous cars are not a silver bullet for all of these problems by any means, but they can go a long way in getting us to a better place with most of these issues.",1398732670

7664073,comment,7662957,7663564,16,0,smacktoward,,,"Here in Virginia, we recently had a pretty striking demonstration of what you&#x27;re talking about. One of the leading politicians in the state, state senator Creigh Deeds, was attacked with a knife and nearly killed by his own son, Austin, who was 24. [1] After the attack, the son killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Deeds was in dire condition, but survived.<p>It came out afterwards that Deeds&#x27; son, who had been diagnosed in the past with bipolar disorder, had undergone a psychiatric evaluation the day before the attack, and as a result of that evaluation had been placed under an emergency custody order. But Virginia law only gives mental health authorities six hours to find a bed to put the patient into in such cases; and in this case no bed could be found in that time, so Austin Deeds was sent home. [2]<p>This has naturally provoked a great deal of concern in these parts, both about how so little resources are available for mental health patients that a potentially violent one could be turned away for lack of an available bed, and about the ridiculously short 6-hour limit on how long such patients can be held. And rightly so -- if help had been available for Austin Deeds when he needed it, he might still be alive today, and his father might never have suffered such a horrific experience.<p>Deeds has recovered now, and upon his return to the legislature announced that he would be pushing hard for mental health reform in the state, garnering wide support. But it&#x27;s telling that the issue had to strike at a political leader for anyone in the political class to care about it overmuch. One wonders how many other families in Virginia have suffered their own horror stories, their own tragedies, in total silence -- just because, since they weren&#x27;t rich or powerful, nobody in a position to fix things could be bothered to care.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/virginia-state-senator-injured-in-home-another-person-found-dead-inside/2013/11/19/3e419ac4-512c-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/virginia-state-sen...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Va-Senator-Recalls-Sons-Attack-Mental-Illness-242231141.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Va-Senator-Recalls-S...</a>",1398731263

It&#x27;s immediately obvious that the dev does not know how v8 and the dom/CSS/rendering engine are tied together. The fact that the CSS transition is triggered by JS has no bearing on speed or optimization.<p>Secondly, most importantly, JS based fps-style animations eat CPU, and battery power of portable devices. On the other hand, CSS transitions are only getting better. Most CSS transitions are GPU optimized and light on CPU usage. A web page should not be strangling the v8 engine for graphical animation that could instead be GPU-bound. This library is clever but a step in the wrong direction. The dev could have contributed to WebKit CSS key frame animation acceleration instead.<p>Thirdly, JS animations cannot handle the sheer amount of particles that CSS transitions can. For instance, take Ana Tudors box-shadow particle hack, and look at how performing it is through GPU acceleration.<p><a href=""http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/shtGe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/shtGe</a>",1398730554

The fire killed the girls; Mrs Willingham was at the Salvation Army store shopping for Christmas gifts. Mr Willingham survived. The next year he was convicted of setting the fire. He was sentenced to death and executed in 2004.<p>His conviction rested on arson investigators’ findings and the testimony of Johnny Webb, a jailhouse informant who claimed that Willingham had confessed to him. Shortly before the execution, Willingham’s lawyers sent the governor and parole board a report from Gerald Hurst, another arson investigator, detailing multiple flaws in the first investigation. He concluded that the fire was caused by a space heater or faulty electrical wiring. Officials appear to have received this report before Willingham’s execution, but did nothing with it.

But no bruises or signs of abuse were found on the children’s bodies.<p>Mr Webb recanted his testimony in 2000. He then recanted his recantation, but admitted to a journalist that “It’s very possible I misunderstood what [Willingham] said.” Mr Webb also testified that he was promised no benefit in exchange for his testimony. In February, however, lawyers working to get Willingham a posthumous pardon revealed a note discovered in Mr Webb’s file with the Navarro County prosecutor promising a reduced charge “based on coop[eration] in Willingham”. On April 3rd Texas denied Willingham a pardon. His lawyers can reapply in April 2016.",1398730029

There were long lines at new stores and lots of doughnuts in the office every day.  The hype prompted new franchises and an overabundance of doughnut shops, but unfortunately the demand dropped as the novelty wore off, and they ended up closing several stores and production facilities in the area.<p>Obviously Krispy Kreme weathered its over-expansion and is doing well today.  I think the question for Groupon and Herbalife is if they have a business plan (and the financial reserves) to make the shift from exponential growth to more measured success.",1398729685

I often mentally hash something out while walking well before I sit down to write.<p>I also try to collect snippets of things I want to develop at some point and create stubs that I come back to later, sometimes months later. It&#x27;s something of a collage and sometimes it results in something good. (Made the front page of HN a few times this year, so I think it&#x27;s better than it used to be. In theory.)",1398729612

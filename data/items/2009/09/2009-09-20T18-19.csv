Interesting to see some of the comments thinking that I'm anti-development with my quote about product mktg and validation is the scarce resource.  Of course great architects and developer are the scare resource but I've seen many code a great solution right now a cul de sac of no market.<p>to me the biggest issue driving this counterculture that I'm seeing is ""trust"" of the capital markets.  Especially since most of the productive actors in this marketplace have lived in a successful open source movement culture for 25 years.  The capital markets (VCs) are at odds with this culture.<p>There are many other points in the post that I would be happy to discuss if there is interest.",1253473107

833393,comment,832615,832615,0,0,chuck_taylor,,,"Both principals' original and rebutting words are at once smart and sloppy. This speaks to the complexity of discussing the economics of knowledge and taste.<p>For example, neither writer seems to have tackled the role of advertising revenue and other intangibles in assessing the value of content.<p>There are comparatively few ads in an edition of The Economist, which might explain why a subscription is so much greater than that of Time. And that should be factored into any newsstand-price-per-page analysis.<p>And some weekly trade publications, delivered by mail at no small cost, are monetarily free to the readers because subscribers pay with other currency -- information about themselves, their companies, and their spending plans.<p>I would also point out that the popularity of a fabric pattern or the life story of Sarah Palin are related more to taste and fad than to the value of any elusive wisdom, such as that derived from The New York Times or The Economist.<p>Mr. Graham is correct in noting a demarcation between conveyance and content, but as Mr. Weaver points out, it's not all that simple to proceed from there.<p>In any event, I've really enjoyed reading both sides of this, and I am impressed by the overall quality of the comments.",1253472982

833390,comment,832963,832963,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"The thing is that newspapers back-in-their-day, didn't make the bulk of their money from selling their content but from advertising.<p>A small town (or even small-city) Newspaper, twenty years ago was:
1) An assortment of major stories culled from the New York Times, AP and what other newswire they subscribed to. 
2) A couple custom national articles and/or editorials. 
3) Some local news pulled from the police blotter
4) Classified adds plus banner ads declaring the usefulness of hypnosis for weight loss and such.<p>The money came from ads. Aside from the small number of major newspapers in the country, the product was completely derivative, completely ad-driven and generally strongly tied with local political interests. I can't see the death of this phenomena as a great loss. Moreover, I can't see websites with newsfeeds as what killed it. Rather, Craigslist killed it with free classified ads <i>and</i> it killed itself by not improving anything, not reducing prices and increasing volume, not innovating and so-forth. It's an industry which previously consisted of a lot of local monopolies and the problem with any monopoly is that it's profits are <i>so</i> good that it will hold to it's position till it dies rather than competing, since competition would result in a profit drop of an order of magnitude - if you have an investment opportunity that makes a solid 10% profit each year, you'd probably keep putting money into it, even if the money that you could invest dropped each year. Why innovate to make 3%?<p>Someone pointed-out the craigslist might make $100 million/year but has wiped-out an industry that made multi-billions. Now the billions previously spent on classifieds are available to buy entirely different kind of products but its still more logical for newspapers to gnaw on the bones of their previous business model.",1253472605

It is very easy to file papers, slap up a web site and put some whiteboards up in cheap office, and have a ""startup""; if you can get 200k a pop, vacuous startups will be manufactured at a great rate, very similar to how we manufactured $300k MacMansions for $100k a pop until that game blew up.   The deposited money of ordinary citizens should not involved in something like you describe, and espeically not in collateralized startup obligations or insurance on the same or whatever else the dark-suited sociopaths will dream up.<p>However, a VC or hedge fund might get into it, as long the investors are millionaires who can afford the losses and presumably have or can buy the educated understanding of the risks.<p>On the other hand, if there were some sort of club or co-op I could join, that I could pay a small monthly fee, and that would then invest the aggregated fees in a new startup every couple of months, I might do that.

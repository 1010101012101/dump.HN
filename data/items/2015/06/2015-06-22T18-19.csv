    2. Nothing with lyrics. Voices are distracting. I&#x27;m really just here for the
       noise that&#x27;s not other humans having a conversation.
    3. Use a streaming service that tailors the music to my preferences. 
       Pandora was my favorite, but I&#x27;m currently on Spotify. I don&#x27;t have to 
       curate my own lists and I still get music that&#x27;s all similar and not

I thought I discovered the topic when Joel (On Sofware) wrote about it in 2000.  While a few people seem to enjoy open offices, the overwhelming majority of developers I know, or who chime in on HN, value a quiet place to work and dislike open offices.<p>And yet, not only has nothing changed, it seems to be getting worse.  It couldn&#x27;t be more clear to me that developers, at least on this issue, simply have no clout <i>as a profession</i>.  There may be a few individuals who can make demands, but on the balance, these are decisions imposed on us, as a group, and we are apparently unable to do anything about it.<p>The really sad thing is, this isn&#x27;t a situation where we&#x27;re asking to fly first class, or for more vacation.  We&#x27;re talking about asking for something that will make us more productive and increase the value we largely hand over to our employers, simply because it&#x27;s depressing to not be able to do a good job due to distractions.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m depressed about it.  There was a time when I read these essays and felt a bit more charged up, like people were starting to understand something important and that things would change.  Well, now we have open offices.<p>I&#x27;ll finish with another variant on my broken record: the industry talks constant about the critical shortage of software engineers, but it won&#x27;t give them a quiet place to work.  Actually, that last sentence is too optimistic - it won&#x27;t <i>allow</i> them a quiet place to work.

If it&#x27;s indeed a practice that constructors aren&#x27;t called directly, then it&#x27;s interesting to enquire why that might be. And indeed an answer presents itself: because they don&#x27;t have names.<p>> Factory methods provide everything else, and are declared in objects, instead of being static like in Ceylon.<p>Wait: a factory method declared on a &quot;companion object&quot; is not like static?! Really?<p>And it seems to me that people probably hide constructors behind factory methods precisely <i>because</i> constructors in Scala don&#x27;t have names. I mean AFAICT, the syntax for calling a factory method of a companion object in scala is <i>exactly the same</i> as the syntax for calling a constructor in Ceylon! You just have to go through a whole lot more ceremony in Scala.<p>> Scala did away with 90% of the mess associated with constructors<p>And, AFAICT, also lost like 75% of their capabilities.

noisy.  Although we in this area are mostly separated from the call center
people (there is only one in this section, probably due to seniority), but
there are some developers who are frequently loud, horsing around with nerf
guns, etc.  My Shure IEMs block all of this easily.  People around me have
conversations about which headphones they should buy, I show them mine, and
then they come back and say they want something with noise-canceling but that
doesn&#x27;t go in their ears.  Sorry, you want water that isn&#x27;t wet, and it can&#x27;t
be helped.  Scared about having your back to the unknown?  Get over it; it&#x27;s a
personal fear that is able to be corrected.  I used to be overly
self-self-conscious, but no longer.  The One way, which is what worked for me,
is to do absolutely nothing distracting while at work.  Ant website I view for
more than a minute is work-related in some small way and I have no
reservations about doing that for as long as I want.  Right now I&#x27;m typing
into a black screen that is not echoing anything that I type back to me, so
anyone passing by me is only going to see what appears to be me pretending to
type.  Let them think that, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  A guy to my left just
views time-wasting websites all day, every day.  He would be the first-fire if
I had any say in this, but I don&#x27;t care about him.    Back to the
headphones... All of these things that could be described as &quot;earbuds&quot; are
junk.  They don&#x27;t seal the ear canal, so you don&#x27;t get sound isolation, then I
would assume if there was noise in the environment&#x27;s, you would be forced to
crank up the volume to compensate.  I am listening to classical music from a
streaming playlist that is running from an mpd server on my home computer
through my phone (unlimited data).  There is no distraction, as I have pruned
this playlist of opera and .  Lyrical music and hip-hop is good, but too much
of it and you get the tape loops in your mind that can be distracting.",1434998342

That&#x27;s by-design.<p>Because you care about the &quot;outcome&quot;, not the &quot;process&quot;: Scala did away with 90% of the mess associated with constructors, and used existing general-purpose features of the language to provide the rest (instead of having to introduce named constructors, default constructors, value constructors, partial constructors, and constructs which are &quot;static&quot; but named differently ...).<p>I don&#x27;t think anything can change your idea that the thing you invented is the best thing ever (and everything else doesn&#x27;t apply, because of the special constraints of Ceylon), therefore have a nice day! :-)",1434997643

Brothels often served as an attraction for travelers, too. Some were even run by women, and ironically enough most European countries didn&#x27;t ban brothels until the 20th century.

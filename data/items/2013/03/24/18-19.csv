Routes in a separate file. Check config/urls.py<p>2. Blueprints are level of abstraction. Check blueprints/post. It's a simple blogging app. Blueprints have their own forms, models, urls, views.<p>3. Add blueprints to the app under config/blueprints.py You can mount the blueprint at '/' or an url prefix viz '/posts'<p>4. Blueprints define their own hooks. Check blueprints/post/__init__.py for an example.<p>5. Schema migration using alembic. Write your model:<p><pre><code>    class Post(db.Model):\n        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n        name = db.Column(db.String(80))\n        title = db.Column(db.String(200))\n        content = db.Column(db.Text)\n\n        def __init__(self, name, title, content):\n            self.name = name\n            self.title = title\n            self.content = content\n</code></pre>\nSave your file and add the blueprint to config/blueprints.py(if it's a blueprint), and run:<p><pre><code>    alembic revision --autogenerate -m ""Create post table.""\n</code></pre>\nCheck the generated schema in migrate/versions/ Tweak the migration and then `alembic upgrade head`<p>6. Flask-WTF and wtforms in general used for validation.<p>7. settings.py used for hooks. See config/settings.py and main.py<p>main.py is the glue. The code is quite simple as it doesn't do much. Ignore manage.py. That's my personal scaffold generator(like rails). Also ignore the custom template formats. That again is my personal slimish jinja templates.<p>I use some variation of this template in my projects. This is just guidelines.

5433057,comment,5432429,5432429,2,0,jjsz,,,"When you mentioned a modern salon I thought about 300 B.C. Back when barbershops / salons were the center of gossip, philosophy, and debates. The stylists / barbers, mostly focused on men, and participated in trimming the beard, hair, and fingernails of other high profile people. Since most of the time they didn't have their own shop, they went to an agora. Agoras were opened to the public, but they had to obviously create a group around high people to allow higher forms of conversations. When men visited these areas, whether it  was the agora itself or the shop / salon, they wanted to tackle two things at the same time just like how you're suggesting bookbinding and painting at the same time. Personally, I can't paint and have a decent conversation at the same time, or bookbind-- I won't get much done because I'll have to look at the person from time to time or I'll feel I'm disrespecting them.<p>I can't think of a being who would want to be in the same room as someone doing bookbinding, painting, and reading. Maybe some readers want a quieter room. Not sure but you should consider topic specific private rooms.<p>Back then, in an agora there wasn't arts and craft tools because men had their public social fix handed to them already from getting groomed, they did this with their private friends. Now. This was done in the open and in the public, outside in parks or plazas. So taking that idea and making it subscription based and inside. I wouldn't go to it. I would go to a public outdoor space, where I have the option to rent bookbinding and painting materials, or other books so I don't have to bring my own there. I shouldn't be excluded to participate if I wanted to bring my own canvas.<p>Now I understand why you said, modern day salon, and not a modern day agora. It's indoor based.",1364151167

However, I know that this a problem of priority rather than the amount of hours in the day. Calm blocks out short amounts of time (~7 minutes) which is short enough to fit most places in my schedule. Defining hard boundaries on the amount of time I spend meditating helps me relax during meditation.<p>### Place:\nCalm has helped me meditate wherever I want to. With headphones in and a seat, I'm able to meditate wherever I have my phone. I usually do it on the L to work (Chicago). It fits conveniently time wise and I'm usually able to find a seat, close my eyes and let go, knowing that the session will end before I reach my destination<p>### Guidance:\nStarting meditation seems hard because you don't know if you are doing it right.

You can't just give users points and badges and level them up for every action they take, that gets old fast. The user needs to feel they are accomplishing things, or the feedback will not be rewarding and engaging. And it should be a user accomplishment, not your accomplishment. Downloading the app is an accomplishment for you, but not for the user, they just pressed a button. Giving them a trophy will cause a lot of eyes to roll.<p>Gamification can be used to promote your marketing efforts, but this should be a secondary function. If your app is used for task management or exercise tracking, reward users for their real-world accomplishments, and have some secondary rewards for getting others users on-board. If your app is used for listening to podcasts, don't give them a ""Playlist Creator"" badge, nobody cares about that.<p>I'm also not sure how well gamification is going to address the problem of ""users dont use many apps for very long and in fact only 25% of the apps survive after 3 months."" How often do people play full-fledged video games for longer than three months? In the long run, motivation from gameplay is a gimmick, and I don't see a lot of people caring about their level or trophy collection on some app enough to change whether or not they continue using it. In fact if the gamification managed to give the user a lot of reward early-on, but doesn't manage to keep it up (which is really hard to doagain, think about video games growing tiresome) the user could actually be pushed away from continued use.

I am not a lawyer, and there's a hell of a lot of risk in what I'm going to tell you to do.</i><p>When I was a teenager, someone I knew did something nonviolent but pretty bad (severe academic dishonesty) and had a non-empty answer to the ""Discipline Question"".<p>You might judge me negatively for keeping such a person as a friend-- and I shouldn't have, but that's another story-- but at the time, I was naive and not a great judge of character. Anyway, he asked for advice on the Discipline Question and I told him to take an ""odds and evens"" strategy: rank his choices. For the odd-numbered (1st, 3rd, ...) choices, omit it. For the even-numbered ones, full disclosure. The idea was that whether the information would be disclosed (by the Guidance Office) was an unknown but constant variable: they'd either tell all colleges or none.<p>If his HS Guidance Office disclosed to all, he'd have a slight chance of getting the ones where he did disclose (his evens) and no chance of getting the ones where he omitted (the odds).<p>If Guidance disclosed to none, he'd have a slight chance of getting the evens and a pretty good chance (they wouldn't know) of getting the odd-numbered choices.<p>His HS took his mistakes off the record, so they didn't disclose. He did well on his odd-numbered college choices and zeroed the even-numbered ones. If I recall correctly, he got 3 out of 5 odds and 0 out of 5 evens. Not a lot of data, but the conclusion was: don't answer the Discipline Question.<p>There isn't a constant, hidden variable (guidance office) for your case but it's still unpredictable how easily employers will find out and how your conviction will be perceived. There are hidden variables you can't easily measure.<p>So I think ""odds and evens"" is the right strategy. Full, honest disclosure with half. Full omission with half. Collect data. Iterate.<p>You didn't hear this from me. I don't know the details and I'm not a felon, but I think it is pretty fucked up how <i>any</i> felony leads to long-term economic disenfranchisement, so I sincerely hope this advice helps.<p>With governments, full disclosure always. It's unambiguously illegal to lie about a felony conviction to get a government job. So tell the truth.<p>Get a lawyer, too. Find someone who's dealt with this and knows the risks. I don't think my ""odds and evens"" approach is, to quote Inception, ""strictly speaking, legal"".",1364149592

However let's jump ahead 2 years:<p>- Browsers will support pluggable scripting languages so the developer will be able to choose Javascript, Dart (native), Ruby, Python or Go as the language they use to code in the browser.  Why?  Because it's the only way to break the innovation stasis in client-side web coding.  As an aside, Microsoft got this right in very early versions of IE when you could script in JS or VBScript for example.<p>- A new Open Source IDE will become defacto.  it will embed Chromium and Webkit and will feel more like a traditional IDE that a text editor with IDE features, or a browser with a console window. The Browser was never designed as an IDE, yet it is becoming one, organically, and accidentally.  Ironic since there are very capable sophisticated IDEs out there that can accelerate web app coding.  Dart gets this right.  Coding in browser is not going to cut it.  You need a sophisticated tool designed explicitly for this purpose to build bigger, more complex, performant applications.<p>I've prototyped some with Dart and my personal opinion is:\n- better than Javascript, but\n- it's evolved from JS which I feel is a critical flaw\n- native IDE is smart, requisite for future web development\n- core libraries and language are changing too rapidly to use in any 'conservative' production application<p>Let's skip the stopgap measures and get a browser that supports Ruby or Go natively, then revisit this whole question.",1364149067

We were doing well, growing like a weed, but also because it was a consulting services company it was very cyclical and dependent on a few large clients. There was a real risk that we could lose both key clients and staff at the same time and eat up our capital reserve. Growth was also dependent on us reinvesting the profits of the business while maintaining working capital. Each time i took money out of the company, it was taking out of it's capital reserves.<p>The earnout comes in a stages as is norm when you're expected to stay involved. So it hasn't changed my life much except for paying off all of my debts.<p>While i think the rich vs king thing might have some truth, I ran my company this time to be king. To enjoy doing good work with smart people and build interesting products. Have an awesome office, run a good conference, and the like. It was a lifestyle business and i wasn't looking to sell it. But i'm happy to have gotten the offer, happy with the arrangement, and happy with my new role as CTO of the acquiring company. It's not perfect, but neither was everything perfect running a company all on my own.<p>The really ironic part is that i've been involved in many startups, which were very intentionally about making money and value. Odeo became Twitter, and really was worth a lot of value, but left after 2 years & sold my options, long before it was clear Twitter would become, well, twitter. With my most recent company, it was about creating a place i wanted to work myself, with a team i liked, doing great work.

I agree with sirn that uWSGI should not be easily overlooked. :)<p>uwsgi protocol is built-in in nginx >= 0.8.40; for older versions (and a general walkthrough), see <a href=""http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Nginx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Nginx.html</a><p>Here's the relevant bit for nginx's .conf:<p><pre><code>  First of all copy the uwsgi_params file (available in the nginx directory of the uWSGI distribution [uWSGI here meaning the uWSGI application server, to be installed separately via your distro's package manager or e.g. pip]) into your Nginx configuration directory, then in a location directive in your Nginx configuration add:\n\n    uwsgi_pass unix:///tmp/uwsgi.sock;\n    include uwsgi_params;\n\n   or if you are using TCP sockets,\n\n    uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3031;\n    include uwsgi_params;\n</code></pre>\n(I would advise the former for performance reasons (unix sockets are faster))<p><pre><code>  Then simply reload Nginx and you are ready to rock your uWSGI powered applications through Nginx.\n</code></pre>\nHere are my nginx relevant directives - in server {} scope,<p><pre><code>    set $server_root   /home/z/www/<basically,your_web_root>;\n    set $uwsgi_socket  unix:$server_root/backend/var/uwsgi.sock;\n</code></pre>\nThen (still in server {} scope),<p><pre><code>    location /api { # my flask app serves <domain>.tld/api\n      uwsgi_pass $uwsgi_socket;\n      include uwsgi_params;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat's it! That way I can reuse $uwsgi_socket as many times as is needed, etc.<p>The most simple way to launch the uWSGI app server would be to e.g.<p><pre><code>  z@<hostname>:~/www/<web_root>/backend/lba$ cat test.sh\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n    uwsgi --post-buffering 1 --enable-threads -s /home/z/www/<web_root>/backend/var/uwsgi.sock -M -p 2 -w lba:app --chmod-socket 666 --pp ..\n\n  uwsgi --help | grep ""\-pp""\n    --pp    add directory (or glob) to pythonpath\n</code></pre>\nSo we add a parent directory (""lba"" containing the actual application files, e.g. __init__.py (can be empty) so that the directory could be imported (<i>lba:app</i> in uWSGI launch), etc.), tell uWSGI that this is to be the parent uwsgi process (<i>-M</i>), point it to its socket (<i>-s</i>), set number or processes (<i>-p</i>), tell it to actually load our 'WSGI module' (<i>-w</i>), and supply other per-application parameters which are not necessary if you just want to test things out.<p>app.py (<i>lba:app</i>) may simply contain (from <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/</a>) e.g.<p><pre><code>  from flask import Flask\n  app = Flask(__name__)\n\n  @app.route('/')\n  def hello_world():\n    return 'Hello World!'\n\n  if __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n</code></pre>\nThat way you can test the sample app by simply <i>sudo service nginx reload</i> and <i>./test.sh</i> (you might need sudo for the latter, too; also, might need to <i>touch ../var/uwsgi.sock</i> and look into <i>uwsgi --help | grep ""user""</i>) You can then put the test.sh (or the uwsgi call line itself) into e.g. supervisor - if the user privilege nuances are sorted out, you more or less have a production-worth setup (as far as nginx <-> uwsgi <-> your app is concerned), methinks.<p><i>edit</i> sirn and antihero make a good point about Emperor mode",1364148602

OP is correct in as far both groups produce intellectual output. Both think in very strict systems which need years to master. Also, it requires a specific kind of creativity to find efficient solutions. \nFor me, personally, studying law and programming was mutually beneficial, because I apply the same form of systematic and creative thinking to both disciplines.<p>On a completely different level, programming is embedded in theoretical computer sciences/physics/maths whereas law is embedded in sociology, philosophy, politics, economics and history.

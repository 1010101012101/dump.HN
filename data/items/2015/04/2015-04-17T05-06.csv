White rice is... comparatively quite plain, to my palette.   Sure, I&#x27;ll eat some, especially if there is some sauce or something to put on it... it&#x27;s not offensive, but there isn&#x27;t a lot of flavour, and the texture is comparatively uninteresting.     Barley, on the other hand, has a very interesting, rich texture, and a nice nutty flavour.   I will eat a bunch of barley.<p>As a kid, my parents would make me Mochi.   They were hippies, so it was the brown rice mochi.   Lately, I&#x27;ve been craving the stuff, and every time I ask my asian friends, they get me white rice based mochi, a very different (and in my opinion, much less flavorful) food.<p>I eventually figured out where I could mail-order the brown rice mochi from.  So good!  but, again, made for hippies, so unlike the white rice mochi, which comes in individual plastic packs, this stuff comes in big sheets you need to cut up.  Hippies. grumble.<p>But yeah, I think a lot of this is just cultural factors.   I can&#x27;t imagine eating tofu with nutritional yeast if I didn&#x27;t have it for breakfast nearly every day of my childhood.   Or nutritional yeast at all, for that matter.  That stuff looks like fish food, and really, what else do you put in your mouth that is that color?  But it&#x27;s so good on popcorn.",1429250332

A data race requires all of the following: aliasing, mutation, and a lack of synchronization. Rust&#x27;s usual ownership rules already make aliasing exclusive with mutation, so out of the box you&#x27;re safe. But when simultaneous aliasing and mutation is exactly what you want, as in a mutex, it&#x27;s safe to subvert the type system as long as you make sure to uphold the synchronization aspect on your own (which Rust nicely helps with by leveraging ownership on the synchronization mechanism itself).<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5vzLKg7y-k&t=31m00s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5vzLKg7y-k&t=31m00s</a>",1429249478

9392375,comment,9390574,9390878,0,0,zenlikethat,,,"Hi, thanks for this.  It can be really hard to get a feel for how other people are thinking about things when one is really zoomed in on all of the little details.  I&#x27;d love to start a conversation - nathan@docker.com if you&#x27;re interested.  In my opinion the tools are still feeling out where their niches and boundaries are, so that may contribute to the confusion.  Networking is a big missing piece here, for instance, and I&#x27;m excited for the work that people like Socketplane (now part of Docker) and Weave are doing to help in this area.<p>If anyone here is curious to get a quick summary, the general gist of the three orchestration tools goes like this:<p>1.) Compose (nee Fig) emerged out of a need for a standard way to specify the run-time properties of a related group of containers.  If you&#x27;ve played with Docker, you may have noticed that flags on run commands (and controlling the order of things like linked containers) spiral out of control fast, so Compose lets you write them all down in a file and manipulate your container groups with a little &quot;shorthand&quot;.<p>2.) Machine is a tool for creating and managing hosts which run the Docker daemon (the bit which does the actual heavy lifting with containers).  When they are created, you can run Docker commands against them remotely using a local Docker client binary!  I got really interested in this project for two reasons.<p>One is that boot2docker-cli (a small Go program to help bootstrap and manage a Virtualbox VM with Docker installed, mostly for OSX and Windows users) was a pretty nice little tool, but I wanted to be able to have multiple VMs and not just one!  Machine is great at this.<p>Likewise, Docker Machine now does the same type of trick for cloud VMs as well - so if I just want to kick up a Digital Ocean server for a few hours, run some containers, and then remove it, I can easily do so without leaving the command line.  The interface for other cloud providers to do this is pretty similar too, so the workflow of using Docker across all supported clouds is the same.<p>I think it serves a lot better for dev/test right now than for prod but like I said the project is still feeling things out.<p>3.) It&#x27;s easier to think of Swarm in terms of the end game IMO - and the end game is a Docker API endpoint (just one!) which works across an arbitrary number of hosts.  Therefore, the user doesn&#x27;t have to reason about multiple hosts on the backend - they just treat it like they&#x27;re running containers on one big computer.  If there aren&#x27;t enough resources to run all the containers that you want to, you could just kick up a few more hosts, add them to the Swarm, and Swarm will fill them in as it goes (kind of like a load balancer can do for requests).  It can do cool things like set anti-affinity on containers so that they never end up on the same host together, or never end up on a Red Hat host even if one is in your cluster, or pack them in as tightly as possible on each host.<p>I don&#x27;t think the orchestration tools address all needs directly (and IMO they shouldn&#x27;t)- logging, monitoring, and HTTP load balancing are good examples of things which don&#x27;t really fall directly into their province directly.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to see the direction that they evolve in be one where they integrate really well with other tools and/or provide standard interfaces to platform-specific tech.  For instance, it would be awesome for docker-machine to be able to import instances created with Ansible, Terraform, etc. and function as kind of a &quot;REPL&quot; to their &quot;compiler&quot; by allowing users to introspect the state of their running containers.  Or for Swarm to act as a front-end for ECS.  Speaking of, to answer your question:<p>> Why do I need Swarm on ECS?<p>Lots of tools &quot;speak Docker API&quot;, so being able to point them at a Docker API and not care that it is ECS on the backend could be really useful.  Additionally, ideally it would free you from being tied to the Amazon API or tools if you either don&#x27;t want to learn them (since that knowledge is only useful for doing AWS work) or if you decide down the line that using, say, Mesos on baremetal as a back-end would suit your needs better instead.<p>Anyway, hope that all helps :)  I could go all day about this stuff.",1429247805

        unsafe { self.inner.lock.lock() }
        MutexGuard::new(&*self.inner, &self.data)
    }
</code></pre>
Note that the self argument is immutable: &quot;&self&quot; instead of &quot;&mut self&quot;. This may seem odd: doesn&#x27;t locking a mutex  <i>require</i> a change to its innards? Which is why you should not be surprised to see the unsafe, which allows us to bend the immutability of &self in order to acquire the lock.<p>In fact, how could it be otherwise? Rust prevents there ever being more than one &mut to something, so if the signature of Mutex::lock was &quot;&mut self&quot;, there could only ever be one usable ref to the Mutex! That would be pointless, of course -- multiple threads need to have references to the mutex.<p>We&#x27;re still safe, though, because the &quot;mut-aliasing&quot; that Rust normally prevents via the borrow checker at compile time is being replaced with a run-time mechanism that achieves the same thing via the Mutex and the MutexGuard [2].<p>[0] <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/index.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/sync/mutex.rs.html#196-211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/sync/mutex.rs.html#196-211</a><p>[2] Well, strictly speaking a RwLock is a closer runtime approximation to the borrow checker&#x27;s rules, because it allows multiple simultaneous readers: <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html</a>",1429247453

The disruption this week has been due to a stdlib API that made use of a very specific pattern involving a mix of unsafe code, ownership transfer, and destructors. Previously it was believed that this particular unsafe code could not lead to memory unsafety, but that happens to be untrue when memory leakage is thrown into the mix.

I was hoping to hear some deeper insights into what specifically Eckel would want to rethink about Scala. I don&#x27;t think he was really able to elucidate what he wants to change. He vaguely mentioned Scala 3, but didn&#x27;t seem to have looked very deeply into it.<p>Like others, I was also a bit perplexed by his description of the community. In his descriptions of Python&#x27;s BDFL, I couldn&#x27;t help but feel Odersky&#x27;s leadership was shortchanged a bit. I primarily programmed in Scala for the past year and my experience with the community has been nothing but positive, whether on mailing lists or StackOverflow.<p>Of course, perception is reality, and even Odersky has spoken on a culture of elitism in Scala in the past. I also think the lack of women in the Scala scene makes a point in itself, as well. I just wish more cogent examples had been provided, because the problems in the community need to be highlighted before they can be solved.<p>My biggest issue with Scala hasn&#x27;t been community, but lack of maturity on the project level. The larger Python, JS, and Ruby communities simply have more out there in terms of community contributed content. The tradeoff for me has been that versus the sheer elegance of Scala.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a lot of truth to the point that the multiparadigm of ways to do something in Scala leads to each team or organization developing a distinct style, which is unfortunate. On the other hand, Scala code seems have this property of evolution toward succinctness and elegance over time. You may not know how to get it right the first shot, but you&#x27;ll eventually roll down the gradually sloped pit of success. In JS, by contrast, doing things the right way tends to look almost like an abuse of the language.",1429246867

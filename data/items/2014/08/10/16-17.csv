If you need a demonstration, then, in the IO monad, open a file (using the functions in System.IO), read the contents (without doing anything else that depends on them), close the file, and then use the file contents.<p>IO still works in data dependency order.",1407689817

8160091,comment,8156675,8159979,2,0,radmuzom,,,"What an idiotic comment. I am so serious about gender rights that I have talked to an actual prostitute and treated with her as much respect as I would do to a mother, sister or friend. Especially in my country where the average people are so regressive that if they hear that a girl has kissed before marriage, they look down upon that girl. However, like a lot of professions, I think the best way to tackle prostitution is to legalize and regulate it. It&#x27;s only in poor places where it is illegal that human trafficking is rampant, whereas it is very easy for some humans to take advantage of the situation. And yes, there are people who are in prostitution by choice. As long as it is regulated by the government (sorry American libertarians, the government actually has a lot of use in countries like mine, irrespective of what you like to think) with proper medical check-ups, strict laws against abuse, it is a very important part of civilization which should never be allowed to become &quot;extinct&quot;.

Even if there was a surplus of licensed truck drivers to meet the new demand, it does not mean that the sole reason trucking companies don&#x27;t wish to hire more workers is because it will cost too much in wages. I suspect the reason they don&#x27;t hire more truckers to fill existing empty truck seats is for the following reasons:<p>1) Every truck runs with a huge damage liability (life insurance, lost goods, rebates to customers). A string of truck crashes from the increased volume would rapidly eat into the profits of more business.<p>2) Operating costs: gas, computer systems, dispatchers, parts, labor. It may be cheaper to raise prices on existing routes, and leave a few trucks empty.<p>Here&#x27;s another snippit:<p>&quot;It’s not an ideal job for everyone. There is no question that trucking is hard work, necessitating long hours and longer stretches away from family. But that’s why it is well compensated, at least in comparison to other jobs not requiring college degrees.&quot;<p>Nobody is paid because the job is hard and lonely. Oil workers in North Dakota aren&#x27;t paid 250k a year because it&#x27;s &quot;5 times&quot; harder than a desk job of 50k. Companies pay workers based on what the company expects its customers will pay. No matter how hard the job is, if the market doesn&#x27;t want to pay higher prices to move goods via truck (which is what would happen if you rose trucker&#x27;s salaries to 50k instead of 40k, for example), then the companies employing the truckers won&#x27;t want to take on those higher wage costs.<p>So TLDR, if you feel you can run a more cost-efficient trucking company, then go fucking do it.",1407688354

He designs he libraries in this way—`bound`[0] is a good example of wrapping up a sophisticated design pattern into a library.<p>So, perhaps they&#x27;re design patterns, but I think calling them that puts them on too high a pedestal. True &quot;functional&quot; design patterns I think are much deeper. They include things like recursion schemes and the Types of Data [1], module design, purely functional data structures, handling laziness and strictness, etc.<p>As others have stated, your parallel v. sequential composition model is murky because it conflates dependency time versus real time.

Applicatives are &quot;executed&quot; by running all of the actions in the list in sequence (weird right?) and then applying all of the arguments to the function.<p>In monads, you &quot;stack&quot; layers. By stack I mean we place a new layer in the &quot;next action slot&quot; of each layer so that to find the next action you have to keep digging down and down through the layers. This means that each later layer can depend upon results of the &quot;action&quot; performed at earlier layers given monads their &quot;dependency&quot; structure.<p>These analyses are known as the free monad and free applicative.

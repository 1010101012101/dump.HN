It&#x27;s simply recognition of the fact that feeling materially superior to others is only one of many routes to happiness.<p>If income doubles for the poor and quadruples for the rich (Cowen&#x27;s postulated mechanism of increasing inequality), the poor have many new sources of happiness. For example, currently only 38% of the poor have a Playstation or XBox [1]. If the income of the poor doubles, probably every poor person could gain some happiness from video games.<p>[1] <a href=""https://explore.data.gov/Energy-and-Utilities/Residential-Energy-Consumption-Survey-RECS-Files-A/eypy-jxs2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://explore.data.gov/Energy-and-Utilities/Residential-En...</a>",1378994389

It supports a single app, but you can run it multiple times. The same way that Heroku supports a single app <i>per git repository</i>. It&#x27;s a kind of design decision, and not a limitation per se.<p>Dokku is a demonstration of what you can achieve with Docker + a very little shell script. In my humble opinion, it&#x27;s very promising that you can achieve so much (something that lets you deploy applications in a Heroku-compatible way) with so little.<p>Also, 12-factor is totally orthogonal: you (not you specifically, but the general developer) should use 12-factor as much as possible (because most of it can be considered as &quot;best practice&quot;, I think), then you can deploy on IAAS, PAAS, your own machines, etc.; and using 12-factor just makes the whole process easier.",1378994357

I in no way qualify for the &#x27;plum&#x27; jobs I described where you work full-time writing said software.<p>But eh, really, the same is true for most systems programming.  Most programming work is CRUD apps.  Only a few really good people get to work on systems programming, even in the proprietary software world.<p>The open-source model means that those of us who keep shit running (or those who write CRUD apps)  can modify small portions of more complex programs when we find problems that are within our ability to solve.",1378994089

He&#x27;s not bragging about being smart, just stating that he is what most people would call intelligent.<p>Intelligence can mean many things, but I like to think of it in terms of &quot;brain power&quot;; the amount of abstract thought you can hold and process, your brain&#x27;s RAM and CPU power so to speak.<p>The term depression is very broad and probably encompasses numerous as-yet-undefined sub-categories, but his description is very much like my own experience: A dulling of the mind. It&#x27;s like downclocking the brain&#x27;s CPU and emotional coprocessor from 2Ghz to 200Mhz. Thinking became slow and required more effort, analytical capabilities pretty much went away and I didn&#x27;t have the spare capacity to really enjoy anything. A song or a movie I knew I liked just didn&#x27;t register because my brain wasn&#x27;t capable of processing it the way it used to. Learning became uninteresting and a chore and problem solving became near impossible. In short, I felt really dumb. I knew I wasn&#x27;t, but I couldn&#x27;t &quot;smarten up&quot; however much I tried. Knowing this, not being able to enjoy learning, problem solving or experiencing something was the worst terror of depression.<p>The experience left me wondering about the immutability or genetic predeterminism of &quot;intelligence&quot;. If we broadly define intelligence as &quot;brain power&quot;, I know now that it can vary a great deal. I wonder how much of this brain power is predetermined through genetics and how much is affected by the environment. We know that diet plays a large role and that certain diseases affect the brain in this way. How much of a person&#x27;s &quot;dumbness&quot; can be removed by changing the external factors? In addition, I think broader aspects of intelligence such as analytical abilities, memory and &quot;abstract capacity&quot; can be taught or improved through training. I know my own &quot;intelligence&quot; certainly has required lots of training through the years, not to mention the knowledge that plays a large part of it that had to be acquired.",1378994056

Being &quot;Alpha&quot; is being construed as a negative thing, as a deficiency in some set of social skills that are presumably teachable.<p>> Are there advocates of taking it too far in the other direction? Of course, but there are advocates of just about everything. I would tend to save my worries regarding those advocates until the problem of resorting to violence too quickly recedes some, and the opposite problem becomes more prevalent outside of mere advocacy.<p>We&#x27;re teaching our children that using violence represents a failure. I strongly believe the employing violence in defense of self or of a third party is entirely appropriate and in some cases the only morally coherent response to the violent aggression of others.<p>Instead, we should be showing our children how to form a rational basis for their actions and to consider their emotional responses in light of that.",1378993698

Wikipedia?&quot; I think it&#x27;s not a good idea to have no moderation - I have a blog where I post once in few months, and daily it gets few spam comments (no real comments). So my point is all websites require moderation - especially popular ones.<p>On a personal note, when I hear the phrase &quot;special relationship&quot;, to me it implies that more data is shared. For example Russia shared with US that they thought Boston bomber could be a terrorist, yet there&#x27;s no &quot;special relationship&quot; there - still the countries share data.

I&#x27;m not listing these to justify any behavior, just to explain what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>1)  If the company has someone in particular in mind that they want to sponsor for a visa, they need to prove they couldn&#x27;t find someone local, so they tailor an unattainable or excessively tight job description.  This is real, and happens very frequently.<p>2)  Many companies discredit experience gained elsewhere.  &quot;2 years with us is worth 5 years anywhere else.&quot;  So they set the bar high.<p>3)  HR reps get burned by letting unqualified people through.  If they can&#x27;t understand themselves if someone knows Python, but they know the last 3 peoples with 5 years experienced got crushed in the interview, then they ask for 10 years.<p>4)  Most firms know that employee referrals are the highest percentage shot for good hires of both technical and cultural fit.  As such, the external barrier is much higher than the internal barrier.  At my current and prior employer, I could get anyone an interview for an open position by dropping their resume off at HR.  It didn&#x27;t matter if they fit the credentials as long as I vouched for them.  This helps them avoid point 3, because if the interview doesn&#x27;t go well, they&#x27;re off the hook.<p>We can talk about the injustice of this, but there is a simple answer.  If there is a place that you want to work, make a friend there.  Or make a friend who has a friend there.",1378992638

6373829,comment,6373073,6373554,10,0,dictum,,,"> the recent cultural shift with the prevalence of handheld computing has a lot of negative side effects and we need to rethink the norms<p>One possible rethinking of the norms would be to worry less about teenagers, letting them sext if that&#x27;s their thing, and advising them to not let societal abuse (e.g. bullying) get to them.<p>Scenario: a teenager sends a nude picture to a friend and the picture becomes public.<p>Possible solutions:<p>1. We keep teenagers from sexting, and people from seeing pictures that teenagers sexted.<p>2. We learn to not abuse teenagers who sexted and had their pictures leaked.<p>The latter is harder, but it&#x27;s better long term. You can force people to not do what might harm them somehow, but you should look at the fundamentals: <i>why do people suffer consequences when they sext?</i> Is it because of the sexting itself, or the reaction people have to it?<p>> I&#x27;m very upset that this is the top comment on here. 14 year old teenagers are definitely children and they do need to be protected by law from predators. Just because they are old enough to have children of their own doesn&#x27;t make them adults. Is not OK for sites or individuals to be collecting sexual images of children and distributing them.<p>Age is a spectrum. A better definition of, say, a 16 year old would be &quot;not quite an adult, not quite a child&quot;. They&#x27;re closer to adulthood than to childhood, but still don&#x27;t have some of the baggage of adulthood. Talk to a 16 year old and you&#x27;ll find out that they don&#x27;t want that lack of baggage to keep them from enjoying the benefits of being treated like adults. I doubt having a line drawn that says you&#x27;re not an adult until you&#x27;re 18 years old, and until then you&#x27;re still a child will keep working in this century. It worked when social dynamics between teenagers and adults were different.",1378992532

It would take a significant amount of extra silicon to add this kind of detection logic.<p>The reason for the basic paranoia about not trusting RdRand directly is that it&#x27;s pretty easy and cheap to make it generate a random number stream that looks random, but is predictable (the RdRand function already is documented to use AES; all you would need to do is make it do AES of an incrementing integer sequence, rather than actual random noise, which is a pretty small change). And heck, if RdRand isn&#x27;t backdoored (no one has presented evidence that is is; it&#x27;s just a standard level of paranoia because subverting the random number generator is a favorite technique of the NSA), it might be in a future version, or AMD or ARMs implementation of a similar instruction in the future may be.<p>Detecting a code sequence and subverting it would be far more difficult. For one, there&#x27;s the extra silicon. There&#x27;s the extra chance of that change introducing other noticeable behaviors. There&#x27;s the extra chance of discovery. It&#x27;s just not worth the costs. And furthermore, if you really are worried about that, then there&#x27;s no reason to limit your paranoia to the RdRand function; you may as well say you can&#x27;t trust the chip to run any crypto code at all.",1378991920

However, mixing it with the state of an already good random number generator (which the kernel needs to have anyhow for platforms without an RdRand instruction) pretty much negates that attack.<p>No one (reasonable) is actually particularly concerned that Intel themselves has backdoored RdRand. But they do want to ensure that they are protected in the case that at some point in the future, some other architecture adds a random number generation instruction and that is backdoored. And since you need to continue to do software random number generation anyhow, the best way to use RdRand is to use both, mix them, and get the best of both worlds (fast entropy available in environments with limited entropy sources, and an auditable software random number generator).<p>All of the other attacks that people are suggesting require a whole hell of a lot more silicon, require changing the behavior of unrelated instructions, and so on. They&#x27;re just too complex and too fragile to be feasible.<p>Instead, why don&#x27;t we spend our time naming and shaming the companies that actually do use backdoored random number generation, like RSA security:<p>> Apparently, RSA Security BSAFE Share for Java 1.1 has DUAL_EC_DRBG as a default:<p>> &quot;The default Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) is the Dual EC-DRBG using a P256 curve with prediction resistance off.&quot;<p>> I didn&#x27;t find an obvious link for the equivalent C/C++ library documentation, but the RSA BSAFE CNG Cryptographic Primitives Library 1.0 FIPS 140-1 Security Policy document from RSA Security at the NIST site says (p.14):<p>> &quot;The Module provides a default RNG, which is the Dual EC DRBG, using a P256 curve and SHA-256.&quot;<p>> Additionally, the RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro-Edition 3.0.0.2 FIPS 140-1 Security Policy says (p.17):<p>> &quot;For R_FIPS140_MODE_FIPS140_ECC and R_FIPS140_MODE_FIPS140_SSL_ECC, Crypto-C ME implements a Dual ECDRBG (Cert. #137) internally&quot;<p>> I&#x27;d be more than a bit wary of any product using RSA Security libraries.<p>From: <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/566329/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/566329/</a><p>For a while, people were confused about why the NSA would have gotten the Dual EC DRBG random number generator introduced into a standard, as it&#x27;s so much slower than most of the other available random number generators, and it was only a year after the standard was released that the potential backdoor was pointed out.

You&#x27;re never going to get away from some of the keywords in Java, nor does that make JAX-RS less &#x27;micro&#x27;<p>Here is an example in Groovy using JAX-RS:<p><pre><code>  @Path(&quot;/hello&quot;)
  class HelloWorld {

    @GET 
    def sayHello() {
      &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

6373721,comment,6373073,6373315,1,0,gersonaya,,,"You made a good point stating that 14-18 years old are not children. They are teenagers. When you&#x27;re at this age, your hormones and sexual desire are at a huge level. So, with or without porn, boys (and girls) tend to think about (and talk about) sex all day. Many young boys and girls masturbate, too. We have a hard time accepting that because teenage sexuality is still a great taboo in our society. Why? Because we like to think that sexual maturity goes along with intellectual maturity, however, that&#x27;s just false. Learning to deal with the fact that teenagers want and have the right to have sex despite their childish behavior is way more wiser than just proibition. What they need is better education on how to deal with their own sexual life.",1378991205

6373716,comment,6369084,6369084,1,0,planckscnst,,,"Many ways that people use browser tabs are a coping mechanism for an inadequate window manager. My window manager is extremely fast, and provides tags, which are at a minimum like workspaces or virtual desktops, but are really much more than that.<p>With a fresh session, tag 1 is selected. This is the default configuration; the tags can really be named anything and can even be dynamic. Any window that is created is then labeled with the tag that is selected. I can deselect tag tag 1 and select tag 2. All the windows that are tagged with 1 are removed from the viewport and any windows with tag 2 appear. Any new windows are then created with tag 2. I can switch back and forth between tag 1 and tag 2 very rapidly. This is the traditional workspace mode of working<p>I can select multiple tags, doing so will show all the windows that have any of the tags I&#x27;ve selected. Furthermore, if I create a new window, it will be labeled with both tags, and switching (which is really just selecting one tag to the exclusion of others) to either tag 1 or tag 2 will show that window. In addition to labeling new windows with whatever tags are currently selected, I can modify an existing window&#x27;s tags very easily. This system lets me group my windows in a very flexible and easy-to-understand way. All of the shortcuts for interacting with my window manager begin with the &quot;windows&quot; key. That is beautiful, because windows<=>window-manager makes sense, and because applications almost never have their own shortcuts that involve that key, so there are no collisions.<p>On top of the tagging feature, it has some excelent layout modes that automatically place windows how I want them, and those layouts are attached to tags - when I select a tag, it changes the layout to the last layout I applied on that tag. For news browsing and general reading, the layout is always that each window uses the full viewport. When it&#x27;s like this, my window manager looks exactly like a fullscreen browser with tabs. On the tag that I typically do coding activities with, I use a layout that splits the screen vertically into two sections: a primary and supplimentary section. Depending on what I&#x27;m doing, the primary window will either have the code I&#x27;m working on, a view of the output from the code I&#x27;m working on; the supplimentary will have a repl, a shell in the directory where my project is, and a documentation browser. Switching between all these windows is also completely keyboard driven, so I can code away, move to the reference to look something up, then get back to my editor very rapidly.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just some of what I have available in my window manager. I almost never use tabs in my terminal, browser, or anything else because the window manager is much more powerful.",1378991149

So you&#x27;re already not going to be detected by looking at RAM access. Also, it&#x27;s not 1992. Modern architectures and modern operating systems are going to throw out instruction timings from Intel manuals.

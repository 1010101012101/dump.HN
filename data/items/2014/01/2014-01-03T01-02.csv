7003756,comment,7001819,7003434,3,0,chubot,,,"I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the grandparent comment meant, but I think I have an idea.  I only skimmed the contents so take this with a grain of salt.<p>Your book is focusing on a pretty narrow part of distributed computing.  I would rename it &quot;Managing State in Distributed Systems&quot;, or &quot;Distributed Storage Systems&quot;.  Your examples are Bigtable and Dynamo, which fall in this category.<p>The book seems to be aimed at sort of a &quot;beginning&quot; audience.  But the topics are inappropriate for a beginning audience, and skewed for an expert audience.<p>Real distributed systems try to be stateless wherever possible.  You need &quot;big computer science&quot; to manage state in distributed systems, but most code in a distributed system should not manage state.  These techniques should be confined to specialized storage systems.<p>Here are some examples of real world distributed systems that don&#x27;t use the described techniques to manage state:<p><pre><code>  - clusters of stateless web servers + single master database (99%+ of websites people use)\n  - message queue / work queue.  A single machine can productively manage 1,000 - 10,000 stateless workers, depending on the workload.\n  - MapReduce\n  - Original GFS\n  - Napster\n  - BitTorrent (tracker and trackerless would be interesting to write about)\n  - BitCoin\n</code></pre>\nThe title seems to imply a practical bent, but it seems more like a collection of ideas (which are important and interesting, but not really what engineers need to know.  IMO the #1 skill for distributed computing is to be competent at BOTH programming a single computer and at system administration).<p>If I wanted to be harsh, I would say it looks like you read a bunch of stuff and didn&#x27;t work with it or implement it?  At the very least, the ideas don&#x27;t seem to be put in the context of commonly deployed distributed systems.<p>People need to understand these simpler, more robust, and more performant techniques, and how to apply them to their specific problem domain, rather than blindly throwing consensus at every problem (which is a disturbing trend I&#x27;ve seen).",1388714330

Some elements that might help make sense of the news:<p>- those numbers are only for DNA: it was the operator that I used, great service; it is a relevant operator on the market, but apparently not the best for international roaming or the countryside; Helsinki coverage makes it a preferred option for the savvy, but not the most senior crowd who travels abroad quite a bit;<p>- the tech scene is extremely tight-knight, sprung out of Nokia; most of those have close ties to some of Jollo developers and have internal information on the project;<p>- the country is not only fairly small, it includes SuperCell, Rovio and that’s the tip of the iceberg: dozen of thousands out of the 600k-1.3M people living in Helsinki or around develop for mobiles; most people openly describe how the country made a conscious, political, country-wide pivot from Nokia’s experience in sparse mobile code to iOS games and apps; half the people there seem to personally know game developers;<p>- iPhones 5C and 5S were not available early this summer and as you can imagine, this was a significant, professionally dire problem (on that note: Seriously, Apple!?); people flew and came back with fistfuls of the things up long after Finnish resellers suffered shortages; I believe that operator subsidies on the handsets are not significant (but I can’t say for sure: as a foreigner, I couldn’t hold a contract myself).<p>Because of that, I’m assuming that operator <i>sales</i> of smartphones are a biased sample; traffic data would be preferable for actual use. However, even that usage is skewed: most people have a mobile platform written in bold on their LinkedIn profile, or ask one who has before buying a handset. That they sold significantly is a great sign however: if the product wasn’t good, local buyers would have heard rumors before — and many people buying are actually considering developing for the thing.",1388713038

It&#x27;s hard to imagine how a loosely coupled workforce like IT professionals could effectively &quot;wage war&quot; on their employers. Words like &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;war&quot; might sound like hyperbole, but these types of disputes can get ugly; when describing the 1984 Miner&#x27;s Union strike in the UK, Margaret Thatcher characterized the situation as:<p><pre><code>  &quot;We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, \n  which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThere are countless other examples of openly hostile responses to unionization across the world.<p>Part of the solution to this adversarial standoff between employer/employees might be a move to normalizing  and standardizing the collective bargaining process. As a high school teacher I work as member of a heavily unionized workforce. Disputes about pay and conditions are baked into the system and occur on a rolling basis. In South Australia, where I work, our enterprise agreement is renegotiated on a rolling 3 year basis. The last agreement took a year longer to finalise which means that negotiations for the 2012,2013,2014 enterprise agreement overlapped the 2015-2017 negotiations (which went on in parallel). From my perspective I see a functioning system which brings great results for me as an employee while protecting my right to a safe workplace.<p>To give an example of the conditions which teachers in my state have fought for:<p><pre><code>  - 13 weeks paid vacation\n  - 10 paid, no questions asked sick days\n  - Excellent salary. I&#x27;m earning 20%-30% more as a teacher than I did as a developer\n  - 2 weeks paid paternity leave\n  - 14 weeks paid maternity leave\n  - 22 hours of class time per week\n  - Tight unfair dismissal laws\n  - Ongoing unconditional pay increases that outpace inflation.\n\n</code></pre>\n&quot;...corporations have been gaining more and more power over their employees.&quot;<p>absolutely agree with you there. There was a lively discussion on HN a while ago about whether making salary information public is a good idea. Employers don&#x27;t want employees to have this information because one of the things it can lead to is collective action along the lines of &quot;...hey we all want to get 110k/yr just like Joe over there...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure how exactly the lessons from not-for-profit, tightly regulated workplaces like schools can be applied more broadly to the rest of the economy, but what I do know is that my standard of living, autonomy and ability to actually stop and smell the roses has increased immeasurably since I became a teacher.<p>I think the labour movement that you&#x27;re calling for needs to be broad based. Instead of a teacher&#x27;s union and a miner&#x27;s union I think a broad based worker&#x27;s union regardless of sector needs to arise which demands that the fruits of our collective labour need to more evenly and fairly be distributed. The 1st world is a rich place, but you&#x27;d have trouble spotting with much of the modern day wage slavery that must be endured.",1388712200

I also remember that Carl Sagan&#x27;s &quot;Cosmos&quot; central point was that it is the technology that dramatically reduces the probability of intelligent life (and that is why we cannot find any aliens around). Even our owners (the friends of Gates couple), remind us about of the same dangers or overpopulation in the face of resource depletion, <a href""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0fnRbhHF"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI0fnRbhHFo</a>. What is new to me is the linear growth of morality. Why?<p>I see that people are simply becoming more ignorant on the basis that they do not need to study the nature and technology because technology already provides everything to them and, furthermore, and, furthermore, defend their ignorance saying that the technology is so far ahead of the morality that we need to harmonize our relationships better rather than learn (that is, advance) the technology. Modern people do not understand that you cannot distinguish between good and bad and decide what to do with your technology if you are illiterate.<p>Might be the letter author refers to the linear IQ growth. Ok, but this also concerns me because we have stifled the natural selection with our advances in medicine and improved quality standards, which allow to survive and reproduce anybody whereas only 2/10 did reproduce yet 100 years ago. Since we did not replace the natural selection with artificial one, the biological quality (aka our genome) of new generations is degrading (you believe the opposite, right?), <a href""http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/768"" rel""nofollo"">http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/7686</a>. I propose to solve this problem not letting the inferior comrades to die but paying for the services with the reproduction right: if you are genetically unhealthy and, thus, take more from the society than give to it, you should let to produce people to the other, those who maintain the civilization and advance the technology. This is in your interest.<p>The article speaks a lot about possible misuse of the technology. But the most astounding fact is that the civilized nations have the technology to organize the comfortable live efficiently, but use it to kill the nature on the daily basis and do not notice it!<p>But I can tell you how you is personally guilty abusing the technology every day: The technology allows you to burn all the precious resources very fast and this is considered as a good thing. The freedom culture and technology gives you cheap gasoline, car and house and I bet that you believe that you are absolutely sure that this is good to have a personal house, separate from the others and waste more because more waste is more consumption, better economy and greener world. Thereby, you hate the consumerism. However, this is the car-house based infrastructure that costs the most to you and to the nature. Once you condense the population into apartments in multifloor buildings, as it was practiced in the Eastern Block, for instance, the resource consumption (lands, for transportation, heating, lighting, and building/maintaining the infrastructure) reduce 10-100 times and we&#x27;ll fit into the ecological footprint. This is how how you can we make the life of 10 billion sustainable. The 10-100 savings are achieved since the average distances are shrinked dramatically, which, per se allows huge savings but additional savings are because you can use more effective (i.e. public) systems of heating and transportation - sharing the resources as consumers, which contributes another order of magnitude. You can even compost in the New York city apartment, <a href""http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/2402/47"" rel""nofollo"">http://sustainability.stackexchange.com/a/2402/476</a>. We can even use trains for inter-city travels instead of planes. Trains do not consume the energy whereas our favorite planes are the paramounts of ineficciency. This way we could reduce carbon emissions, save fuels and stop global dimming. <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming#Probable_cause"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming#Probable_causes</a>. Yet, we wont, right? There are certainly bad people who can use terrible technology for bad and we better write Bill Gates about them. We have a right to be independent, self-reliant, live in a private house and spend a fair amount of gasoline.<p>I like the communist preaching telling that we should stop consumerism, greediness and other drivers of capitalist hell and turn to sympathy, concern for the others, unfamiliar and the rational social planning environment. I even think robots should do the same, cooperate rather than fight for their egoistic interests. What I do not like is that you remove the part predicting that we&#x27;ll have consciousness people who will stop wasting lands in 2014 from the Isaak Asimov interview (compare <a href""http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.h...</a> and what you have in <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=699564"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6995644</a>).

So, when you speak about some adversaries that will use technology for bad, can I look at you? I always look at you because you are the that criminal.<p>Do you keep up with the morality to understand what I am talking about?

This bullshit about &quot;community&quot; or whatever is a nice sugar coating for the whole issue, but it really has to do with legal jurisdiction and economics.<p>Uber drivers are not employees. They are independent contractors. They can be part of a limo company or they can be literally independent, and drive the car they own/lease around. That is what many drivers in Philadelphia do. So in that sense, Uber is pretty much a more expensive, clean, and medallion-free version of a taxicab.<p>This is precisely why it isn&#x27;t Uber&#x27;s fault <i>at all</i> for what happened, especially because the service wasn&#x27;t used in any stage of this scenario. So in that sense, I think it&#x27;s good that they are &quot;standing their ground&quot; and emphasizing how background they are in this whole operation.<p>Personally, I like that. I&#x27;m a big believer in supporting your local economy, and I like how my Uber fares are mostly going to the driver. But the other side of that coin, responsibility, is <i>also</i> being saddled on the Uber driver. I also like that. It means that it&#x27;s up to the driver and I, not some bullshit startup 5,000 miles away, to set out the rules of the trip. It makes Uber a better company to contract from and it makes the whole trip feel more &quot;homey&quot; rather than some kind of &quot;ride from above&quot;.<p>In my opinion, Uber&#x27;s done a great job at fostering its community by staying the FUCK out of my business.",1388711527

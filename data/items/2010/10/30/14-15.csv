For acute doses, Modafinil is safer than caffeine.<p>The FDA is ridiculously risk-averse when it comes to approving drugs.

My general experience with them is that they work, they keep you up longer than you would normally be able to, they keep you alert, you don't feel like you are hopped up either.<p>The effect only lasts so long though, after being up for over 24 hours, your body gets tired, and the effectiveness of the drug gets worse. I didn't really go past 36 hours, but if I wanted to I could have. Note that I didn't purposely try and stay up all those times, I work graveyard shifts and ended up having important things come up when I needed to sleep and I was forced to stay up.<p>Modafinil really did help me when I was tired, but as far as being a 'smart drug' it wasn't exactly mind blowing. It did make it easier to focus, but I could just as easily focus on a TV show, or a website, versus a piece of code I wanted to finish. So if you need to stay up, study, or get something done and you are determined to do it, this is great. If you want something to augment your day to day life and make you 'smarter' this really isn't for you.<p>Though there are more things popping up saying that it might have worse long term side effects than previously thought, I didn't really have any that I know of, but if I get brain cancer in a year I guess I know why. :)",1288450244

1850947,comment,1848278,1849993,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Many people say this, but it's simply not true. The numbers miss crucial information, and I'll explain why. The reason that I've got this knowledge that isn't widely known is that my wife works for a hospital, where she is the ""Manager of Budget and Reimbursement"". That means that half of her job (and that of her department) is to secure reimbursement from Medicare (and Medicaid).<p>If you're sharp, you'll already see where this is headed.<p>The problem is that Medicare, while not quite a monopsony, is so large that they can call the shots pretty much as they like. Where other healthcare insurance providers (say, Aetna) still exist, Medicare's market share -- and thus power in the market -- is many times larger than the biggest of them. That being the case, Medicare can largely dictate unilaterally the terms under which it's willing to pay out. And that is the very <i>raison d'etre</i> for my wife's department.<p>So while other providers show greater expenses for administrative costs, Medicare's own expenses for the equivalent is far lower. But that doesn't mean that, in the larger picture of the patient's care, these expenses are not being incurred.<p>Medicare's size and market power allows them to demand that providers (e.g., my wife's hospital) offload a huge amount of the administrative costs, doing much of what ought to be Medicare's own work (by comparison with what's done by and for other carriers) for them. This means that while Medicare isn't paying <i>directly</i> for it, the administrative expenses are still incurred in the course of patient care; it's just that the costs are hidden from Medicare books, and must be amortized across the rest of the hospital accounting.<p>This means that half of the expenses the hospital pays for my wife and her department are really Medicare expenses, but don't show up on Medicare books -- instead, they're amortized as a fixed expense across the whole hospital.",1288450029

To say that most economists have no contact or interest in empiricism is incorrect.<p>(2) The point about simple models is not that economists fully believe them---it's that they force everyone to be explicit about assumptions. They also try to identify what are the key features of admittedly very complex phenomena. This is what models do in most scientific endeavor. That the models often perform poorly is a sign of an immature science---not fraud or dishonesty. You'd get eternal fame and become fantastically rich if you came up with a financial model with great predictive powers---do economists not create such models because they are stupid and corrupt? That seems unlikely.<p>(3) The transistor example completely misses the key distinction that <i>every</i> presentation of the simple supply and demand model always makes - i.e., there is a difference between the short term and long term.

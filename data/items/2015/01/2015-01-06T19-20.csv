And if you call anything that presents that issue as &quot;imperative&quot;, virtually <i>all</i> programming languages are &quot;imperative&quot;.",1420574397

One way to think of Haskell is as a purely functional, lazy analogue to the C Preprocessor. Your program is then merely a function whose value is a set of instructions for performing the effects you desire on some particular machine. The cool thing about being lazy in this context is that preprocessing time (evaluation of the function) and runtime are interleaved rather than separate (as in the case of C).",1420574025

Instead, find a way to remove yourself from the rules that they created.  After all, rules are just constructs and can be changed by anyone.<p>If enough people stopped allowing employers to push 60-hour work weeks on programmers [2], then we might start to see some change.  The way that I stopped employers from abusing my time was to first admit that it was myself that was allowing it to be abused, and then to say no and instead show them what I could accomplish in 8 hours (or 40 hours per week).  If an employer violated my rules, I left.  That&#x27;s my rule.  It may mean that I miss out on some opportunities, but there are so many more opportunities for people out there that stick to their principles (within reason) and work with other decent people.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ll be more clear.  The overall point I&#x27;m making to you in this comment and others is that you need to stop thinking in absolutes.  There is too much pent up stress that doesn&#x27;t need to be there, and your life will be a lot better if you stop feeling like things are things are set in stone (because they&#x27;re not).

8846482,comment,8845809,8846280,0,0,dlhdesign,,,"> This guy isn&#x27;t in charge, so he blames young people and assumes they are in charge.<p>What makes you think he&#x27;s not &quot;in charge&quot;?<p>> Young people are just followers. They follow the money, they do what they&#x27;re told, they adopt fashions in order to SURVIVE, not out of some kind of &quot;strange entitlement.&quot;<p>If you are young and believe this, I am sad for you.<p>&quot;Youth&quot; (those in their 20&#x27;s, for example) have some of the best kind of power - the unfettered kind. As a generalization/simplification, those in their 20&#x27;s have fewer dedicated costs in their lives (rent and food at the least; car payment perhaps). That gives them the freedom to CHOOSE. That&#x27;s the power of youth - choice. In youth, a person can choose to lift up and move. Can choose to quit - or stay at - a job because of principals. Can choose to change careers, become an expert in one field or a generalist in many. I won&#x27;t go so far as to say all things are possible, but there are certainly many paths that could be traveled with relative (key part there - relative) ease.
As we get older, the dedicated costs (generally - there are certainly exceptions) go up. House payments. Kids. Medical expenses (personal and family). Income may (or may not) go up, but it&#x27;s almost certain that key life options will decline. There are still choices to make and control of life to be had for sure, but they are not so numerous; the road does not web outward as it did in youth so much as it forks in minor directional changes.<p>So - if anyone out there is still in their youth (which is more a state of mind than physical being, mind), I suggest you try different things. Experiment with life. Follow your true passions and see where they lead. The author of this blog (and myself; and others) did that and it turned out that our passions would become an industry that would change the world. I only hope your passions (if you have the heart to chase them) will yield the same so that we can share in that. We can use this thing that we were around to see birthed to do so. Or something better if you prefer; but you&#x27;ll need to make that happen because we&#x27;re tired and just want to enjoy our time with our communal child as long as we can, please.",1420573542

I am actually waiting to read your wait-free removal and lock-free append extensions.<p>Now I understand your first paragraph a bit better :P. I would avoid using EC. Instead I would find another term. To me, EC implies that the object can be inconsistent for some period of time but will eventually reach a consistent state across all nodes. Your titling of the link and your use of the EC term kind of threw me off a bit.<p>&quot;Modern computer are eventually consistent systems by virtue of the caching layers (and local registers) - only once modifications make it to a shared cache are they globally visible.&quot;<p>I agree with you but I would leave registers/cache out of this. Yes, if a read to a memory location could return stale data then this would be absolutely be a problem. But I would argue that reading a memory location into a register then performing RMW ops on it does not necessarily put the system in an inconsistent state. This because RMW ops on a register dont change the actual shared object.<p>I think a better example for what you are talking about is write buffers in individual processor cores. These can contain intermediate state visible to that processor but not to others. Such relaxed consistency procesors will require appropriately placed fences to achieve linearizability.",1420572227

I made sure to go above and beyond on the project, and at the end of the engagement the financial firm offered me a full time position as a Senior Front End Developer making ~$125k plus a 12% annual bonus. 
I was so surprised at the offer I called the developer who offered me the job just to make sure he knew about my terrible educational background. He said &quot;Frankly, college isn&#x27;t a good indicator of actual skill, I just put it on the list because HR requires me to. I have let more people go with CS degrees from Stanford than anywhere else because they come in and think they know everything. I want people who are constantly trying to improve.

You can use IF to optimize gaining lean weight (muscle mass) just as you can use it to aid weight-loss.<p>IF is about managing appetite mostly, as the hormone that plays a large role in driving hunger (ghrelin) is highly habitual; the more often you eat, the more often you&#x27;re going to be hungry. So by reducing the time-window in which you eat, you reduce the window when you&#x27;ll feel hungry, which can dramatically aid diet adherence.<p>But that&#x27;s more the everyday form of IF. If you&#x27;re on a eat-stop-eat type protocol and fast once or twice a week, you&#x27;re probably using it to ensure you maintain a caloric deficit each week.

8846260,comment,8844848,8844848,0,0,aarmenante,,,"I went through DevBootcamp in SF after doing business development for a YC company for a year. My day to day job was interacting with engineering teams, and I found it really frustrating not understanding what people were talking about once the conversation left the business realm. When my boss asked me to checkout one of the developer bootcamps as a potential partner I decided to apply.<p>I had always been interested in computers and the web, but never made the leap to building something with substance. It&#x27;s really hard to figure out how all the moving parts of web development work together if you&#x27;re on the outside looking in. I would read books, follow tutorials, ask friends to teach me, but I would always get stuck on something stupid like installing Postgres. The most important thing I learned at DevBootcamp was how to figure that shit out by myself without wasting time spinning my wheels in frustration.<p>The numbers that the schools boast about post bootcamp success are really inflated. Very few people who I graduated with found 100k jobs right out the gate. Most settled for 60-80k range, and it took a few months of looking (not bad though!). I&#x27;m currently in my second engineering job working on a Java stack. A job in a language and framework that DevBootcamp did not teach.<p>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t understand that most of these programs are highly selective and fucking BRUTAL... I was at school grinding away most nights till 1 in the morning. Not only are they challenging in technical sense, but emotionally intense. Being stuck in a room with 30 really smart people who are sleep deprived and being forced to do yoga after a marathon coding session is not easy. I saw people cry on numerous occasions.<p>Getting a job is hard because of the assumptions people have about these programs. Everyone I went though the program with (and finished) might not have had a CS degree, but they ENJOYED PROGRAMING . Something I can&#x27;t say about everyone I work with. I went though many interviews where I could tell the person I was white-boarding with wasn&#x27;t going to give me a shot.  I remember being in a final round technical interview and was asked a standard algo question. After answering the problem the person interviewing me asked me how I got to the solution... I had been asked it a million times before and googled the answer after the first time it stumped me in an interview. He did not like my answer.<p>Good programers are confident and enthusiastic.<p>Having a CS degree and a math background does not make you good at your job or a great engineer. It&#x27;s probably a requirement to work on some of the really hard stuff. Google X/Palantir stuff...<p>I think most of the people coming out of these camps are dangerous enough to make an impact anywhere they go. Given  a shot and a little finishing polish they will become great engineers.",1420571090

The domain of this function is any (non-primitive?) Java type.  The range is things of the form Iterable<T>.<p>Some type constructors have a special property.  In programming speak, they&#x27;re &quot;things you can sensibly map over.&quot;  From a math perspective, they&#x27;re one half of a functor - a &quot;structure preserving map between categories&quot;.  The type constructor maps the category&#x27;s objects, we need to add a function to map arrows.  In Haskell, we do that by creating an instance of Functor, where we define the function &quot;fmap&quot; for the specific type constructor.<p>For some functors, you can reasonably define a function like your &quot;transformAndConcat&quot; (&quot;bind&quot; in math and Haskell) and something that produces a singleton of whatever iterable (or the equivalent, for things that aren&#x27;t containers).  The triple of functor, transformAndConcat, and singleton (such that they obey the Monad laws) is a monad - in the same sense that a pair of a set and an associative operation is a semigroup.<p>The way math defines a monad is subtly different - they use concat (called &quot;join&quot; or &quot;eta&quot;) directly, but you can define transformAndConcat using only concat and map (and concat using only transformAndConcat and id) so these are equivalent they just look a little different.",1420570900

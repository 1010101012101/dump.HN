Part of this is educating the hacker on why your assets are valuable.<p>What drives us crazy about the stereotype that you see discussed here is the perception that all or most of the value will be brought to the table by the hacker, while most of the reward will be accrued by the other guy.  Emails like ""I have an idea and a business plan all worked out, I just need a hacker"" are translated as ""I want to pay you to build something that will glorify and enrich me"".  You want to instead say something that will be translated as ""I need a partner with complimentary skills to my own so that we may achieve _______ together!"" and insert ""glory and wealth"" or ""social change"" or ""a solution to X problem"", or whatever floats your boat.<p>So, you ask, what's something I could bring to the table that hackers would find valuable?  Characterize it this way: all the things hackers don't want to do but must be done to run a business.  Law expertise, especially in taxes and intellectual property rights, is extremely valuable.  Expertise and experience in dealing with state and federal regulators is another valuable asset.  You need something specific to point to that can be ""valuated"" in some qualitative way (quantitative is even better).<p>A business plan does not carry any value, unless you can point to specific things in that plan that will help you achieve success (i.e., if evidence of the valuable things I listed above are in the business plan, then maybe your approach should be ""read my business plan from the perspective of a partner.  I'd like your feedback"").  Any doofus can write out some pages explaining what they want to do and hand-wave about how it's going to happen.  It takes someone with skill and good judgement to write a plan that references market data (perhaps even with results of hiring a market research firm), a viable marketing strategy with a rationale based on data, a strategy for growth made on reasonable assumptions that should be based on data, leads on funding, leads on talent recruiting, relevant legal issues and proposals for dealing with them, etc, etc, etc.<p>Perhaps you don't have the skill to do even that.  Then prove that you have the connections and funding to assemble the team that does have the skills needed to make your venture happen.<p>Hopefully this helps.  I could go on, but this is already a long post.",1207335096

You can define product/market fit however you like-- but by that definition, most consumer apps don't have it.  A customer can ""buy"" a product with money or their time/attention.

Andreessen found a great product/market fit with the Netscape browser, but monetization of it really only came in the form of a few bizdev deals (which didn't cover costs, I don't think).  Money, in many of these iconic companies, was NOT piling up.<p>Regarding my company, we focused initially on a non-paying market (individual lifehackers), as that was easiest to build for and launch a rough beta for.

I would like advice on recruiting a hacker and keeping my hackers happy.  For hackers who have had successful startups with non-hacking partners, what worked?  Rather then hearing about how bad and infuriating these relationships are, I would like to hear a different perspective about how they can work well from a basis of mutual respect.  If you had a bad hacker-nonhacker partnership, how could the non-hacking partner have done better?<p>Also, how can I refine my approach when approaching and recruiting a hacker?",1207332452

Are you suggesting a ""dividends off of profits"" type of thing for growth companies?  Aren't growth companies supposed to be reinvesting profits in their own growth?<p>The problem with dividends is that they are really only good one the initial investment is liquid.  So if Berkshire invests in a value company that throws off 3% dividends per quarter, that's great.  But it's only great because they can get their cash out at any time.<p>If a VC invests in a startup (say $1mm), how exciting is the prospect of 50% chance of failure, but a possible 3% quarterly dividend IF the company succeeds?  With no actual market to sell their initial investment of $1mm?<p>I can't make these numbers look attractive in my head.",1207332421

Saying that learning a new language is just a matter of learning a new syntax is like saying that an English-speaking, non-German speaker could translate a German text to English by taking a German-English dictionary and going through and translating the words one-by-one.  It's not quite as simple as that.",1207332233

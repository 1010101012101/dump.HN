It&#x27;s typically mastered <i>in</i> ideal studio conditions but then it&#x27;s also typically tried out in known inferior ones - for example, almost every recording studio used to have a pair of Yamaha NS-10 speakers, which were deliberately engineered to deliver crap home hifi performance, with the rule of thumb being &#x27;if it sounds good on them, it&#x27;ll sound good on anything.&#x27; Do a Google Image search on&#x27;recording studio&#x27; and you&#x27;ll loads on these el-cheapo monitors sitting atop mixers that cost tens or even hundreds of times as much.<p>Learn more here: <a href=""http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep08/articles/yamahans10.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep08/articles/yamahans10.ht...</a><p>And even after using tools like that, the final test is (and has long been) to listen to the program material in a car, on a boombox, on a phone, or whatever - just like in film, the director doesn&#x27;t usually sign off on the final product until after taking it to a screening theater or putting it in the DVD/bluray player at home, as appropriate.<p>People who work in audio production are <i>abundantly</i> aware that music is listened to in very different environments from where it is created.

Nothing&#x27;s changed there.<p>I think the issue here is that someone else (Apple) has gone and set up an encrypted environment for you in such a way that actively prevents law enforcement from carrying out legal investigations with a warrant on an incredibly popular series of devices that they were capable of searching before.  Let&#x27;s face it - the number of people who are buying iPhones because they are now encrypted is miniscule.  If you really wanted to encrypt all of your data, optional full disk encryption already existed on other phones.  The problem the police have with it is that it&#x27;s now set up by default, they can no longer access it when they do have a valid warrant and this extends to <i>everyone</i> instead of just the handful of criminals that would take extra steps to encrypt their data.

Survival of the fittest for a virus usually means allowing the host to live longer - in other words LESS lethal. It is not likely to become airborne, and if it did it would not be ebola any more. The symptoms of most diseases are not an accident, they are tied to the means of transmission:
Colds make you cough and sneeze.
Flu makes you cough, sneeze, barf and sweat.
Rabies makes you crazy and want to bite.
STDs some think may make people horny.
Ebola makes you barf, shit, bleed, sweat.<p>The one scary thing is I once read that a single gene make Ebola hemoragic, and if that were to transfer to a flu, that would be very deadly. But it would also be less virulent due to that same deadliness and so would be selected against as our response to related flu vidii would wipe it out.<p>None of that is helpful short term, but this notion of the virus getting more horrible than it already is, I don&#x27;t think so.",1412819343

Mr. Blow&#x27;s specific example will be inlined by both g++ and clang, (I haven&#x27;t tested MSVC) depending on the optimization level you set.<p><i>std::function</i> does introduce overhead, and the reason why is important:<p>How can you implement an array of lambdas that all accept the same signature, but close over different kinds of environments?  You need to be able to copy and destruct those environments without static knowledge of how big they are and what&#x27;s in them.<p>std::function makes this work by allocating the environment on the heap and hiding it from the type signature.  If you are averse to this extra overhead, there&#x27;s a really easy rule to follow: Until you actually explicitly write &quot;std::function&quot; in your code, you do not pay its cost.<p>I know a few ways around this:<p>If you always use auto when dealing with function-local lambdas, you don&#x27;t pay any extra overhead.  You can think of each lambda as being the sole instance of a struct that contains the environment to be closed over, plus a non-virtual method.  Just be aware that no lambda is type-compatible with any other. (exception: two lambdas are type-compatible if they have empty environments and the same type signature)<p>You can templatize lambda-consuming functions over the type of the lambda.  This can work out really well if you pay attention to how function inlining happens, as the compiler can not only inline the template function, but the lambda as well.  You can generally assume that the compiler is capable of fully inlining maps and folds.<p>Lastly, if your lambda doesn&#x27;t close over anything, you can cast it as a C-style function pointer.",1412817760

I&#x27;ve noticed that much of the time in these presentations, there seems to be a level of disdain towards programmers who don&#x27;t optimize things down to the bit. (For example, Acton follows a dozen slides on minute cache optimization — featuring assembly examples — with &quot;Bad programming is easy&quot; and &quot;Design patterns are spoonfed material for brainless programmers incapable of independent thought...&quot;)<p>This really bothers me. On the one hand, people like Blow and Acton are working on some of the most complicated software in the world, so I have to give them all my respect. At the same time, this programming style is so alien to me that I simply can&#x27;t make sense of Acton&#x27;s patterns and optimizations from a cursory glance. (Blow&#x27;s examples from AAA development similarly disturb me, though they&#x27;re much more comprehensible.) This is <i>not</i> what got me into programming, and yet these presentations by coders I respect make me feel like I&#x27;m a dummy who&#x27;s completely &quot;doing it wrong&quot;.<p>I get the feeling that there&#x27;s a whole separate world of these low-level, performance-optimizing developers who&#x27;ve shrugged off the mainstream and have their own, parallel outlook on how programming should be done. Much of the time, their ideas are very interesting to me. But I don&#x27;t know how to reconcile their methodology with mine, which works on a much higher level and makes iteration and development so fun and easy — even if things like OO and design patterns bite me in the butt sometimes. I know that many of us here, spoiled by web and app development, must feel the same way.<p>Is this sort of ascetic, hardware-savvy code really what &quot;good programming&quot; looks like?

8430316,comment,8427086,8430055,0,0,theothermkn,,,"> FWIW the words pull and push are used in sailing training to emphasize the importance of keeping the leeward flow attached when going to weather.<p>Ding ding ding! Sailing is a practical matter, for nearly all sailors. It&#x27;s nearly a folk activity. The models that are used to transmit and retain that information have more to do with achieving results than with achieving <i>theoretical understanding</i>. The trouble only really comes in when we try to use these pragmatic models as scientific models!<p>> Assuming the flow is attached on the leeward side, does that side also turn flow and generate force?<p>Notionally, yes. To be theoretical, attached flow on the leeward side is going to exert <i>less pressure</i> than detached flow would, due to irreversibilities in the detached turbulent flow. To be even stricter, because the equations of subsonic flow are elliptical and not hyperbolic, a mess of detached flow on the leeward side is going to jam up the whole works, even upstream and to windward.<p>The difficulty comes in when we try to mentally divide the flow between the windward and leeward sides of the sail. (Additional difficulty comes in because the &quot;adverse pressure gradient&quot; is essential to understanding this, but is tricky enough that it would probably do more harm than good to talk about it to sailing students. The first rule of Sailing Club is that you do not talk about the adverse pressure gradient. The second rule of....)<p>In practice, &quot;[k]eeping the leeward flow attached&quot; really amounts to &quot;not stalling the sail.&quot; This is probably more important when sailing to windward because you&#x27;re running as close to a stall as you can (at as high an angle of attack as you can) in order to point as high as you can. Also, with the sheets reefed in and with the higher apparent wind, the sail is more likely to be distorted. This can result in one part of the sail being stalled. Once one part stalls, the increased pressure in that area is likely to inject turbulent flow into neighboring areas that might otherwise not be stalled.<p>Another thing to consider is that there&#x27;s something filling in that area of detached flow. Guess where it comes from? The windward side of the sail via the trailing edge. While the flow has to come off the leech in the direction of the leech, nature is a bit lest strict about what it does right after; It can get turned completely around, in short order, to fill that void behind the sail. The only thing it requires is that its turning radius not be unreasonably small. Congratulations! You&#x27;ve just (1) injected higher-pressure air into the lee, and equivalently (2) stopped turning the flow on the windward side. Because of (2), you can bet that there&#x27;s an equivalent drop in pressure on the windward side as well.<p>That was the pragmatic way of understanding things. Now, I&#x27;m going to break the first rule of Sailing Club. When a flow is adjacent to a surface, the flow stops at the surface. That is, a 10 knot breeze blowing over your sail comes to a halt <i>at the part of the breeze that contacts the sail</i>. Because the adjacent flow hasn&#x27;t touched the surface, it tries to maintain its 10 knots. However, nature is sticky. Any time there are adjacent regions of flow traveling at different velocities--any time there is a <i>velocity gradient</i>--viscosity tries to average things out: The flow right next to the sail is nearly stopped; The bit next to that is traveling a bit faster; And so on. (Incidentally, on a larger scale, this is why the wind is stronger aloft than on the deck. You&#x27;re in the boundary layer, as it&#x27;s called.) All of this viscous transfer is <i>doing work on the flow</i>. Doing work raises pressure. Because this happens <i>as the flow moves downstream</i>, more work is done on the flow the farther you get from the luff, and the higher the pressure gets. I don&#x27;t think I need to convince you that fluids like to go away from high pressure to lower pressure. That is, fluids like to follow <i>pressure gradients</i>. And <i>adverse pressure gradient</i> can stop, and even reverse a flow. Note that this is likely to happen at the surface in question. Typically, the flow on the windward side has a stronger favorable pressure gradient to start with, and so can tolerate the adverse contributions of the viscous boundary layer without becoming detached. Because the point of a sail is to have lower pressure on the leeward side, there&#x27;s less <i>total pressure</i> available to start with to overcome the adverse pressure gradient, and the flow can become detached on the back side of the sail.<p>This detached condition is called, in aeronautical terms, a &quot;stall&quot;.<p>Just sheet in until the telltales flutter, and then back off until they don&#x27;t. If that doesn&#x27;t work, play with the vang until it does. ;)",1412817214

Most of the time a 5-figure debt will be worth the effort.  When you start getting into $5k or less debts, it&#x27;s sort of a crapshoot.  The original owner of the debt will often sell it for pennies on the dollar, at which point a collector will do their best to get as much as they can out of people without a civil case, because civil cases are expensive and there&#x27;s no real guarantee of return (people with no money, people on the verge of bankruptcy, etc).<p>The general advice is not to negotiate at <i>all</i> with creditors.  Once something&#x27;s gone into collections, you will see no benefit to resolving the debt other than mitigating your risk of a law suit.  And even at that point, the first phase is a mediation option wherein you&#x27;d again be able to throw out a number, do a payment plan, etc.",1412816500

But, by the same token, you can experiment in ways that you normally wouldn&#x27;t. You get to dictate things like, oh, what is a cons cell. I have lazy conses that look like ordinary conses: they satisfy consp, and work with car, cdr, rplaca and rplacd. You can invent new evaluation rules. I came up with a way to have Lisp-1 and Lisp-2 in a single dialect, seamlessly, with the conveniences of both.  I have Python-like array access. I made traditional Lisp list operations work with vectors and strings: you can mapcar through a string and so on. Sequences and hashes are functions. For instance orf is a combinator that combines functions analogously to the Lisp or operator. If hash1 and hash2 are hash tables, you can do something like [orf hash1 hash2 func] to create a function which takes one one-argument that will look that argument in hash1; then if that returns nil, it will try hash2, and if that returns nil, it will pass the key to func and return whatever that returns. Or [&quot;abc&quot; 1] returns the character #\b. [mapcar &quot;abc&quot; &#x27;(2 0 1)] yields &quot;cab&quot;: the numeric indices are mapped through &quot;abc&quot;, as if it were a index to character function. Fun things like this are good reasons to experiment with your dialect.<p>I believe TXR is a great companion if you&#x27;re a Lisper working in ... one of those other environments.<p>Ah, one more thing. Well, two, or maybe three. Part of why I used C was to create a project whose tidy, clean internals stand in stark contrast to some of popular written-in-C scripting languages. You know, to sock it to them! See, there is a hidden agenda: the call of &quot;I can do this better&quot;. If you use C, then a more direct comparison is possible. Secondly, people widely understand C. Give them a cleanly written project in C, and maybe they will hack on it, and from there understand something about Lisp too.  C means low dependencies from the point of view of packaging: easy porting with just basic shell environment with make and a C compiler.  Cross-compiling for ARM or whatever is a piece of cake. Easy work for package maintainers, ...",1412816467

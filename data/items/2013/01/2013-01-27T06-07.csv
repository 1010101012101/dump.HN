5123470,comment,5119213,5120945,2,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Everyone flees from the ""tough it up"" solution because we as people don't like to blame ourselves or change ourselves. We want our situation to change, our problem to change and go away. The only thing that can change is you. Cheesy but there's a reason people keep repeating it. ""Tough it up"" stays true to nature, it's a harsh world and walking around without armor expecting everything to be soft and fuzzy is just foolish. You can either change the world to be softer or yourself to be harder. One of these methods is realistic and the other is not.<p>I have a ton of work and am limited on time, so pardon my harshness.<p>- Try out different therapists and mental health professionals. Try a 2 hour session with each and make sure you tell them you're shopping around for a good therapist. They'll give you all sorts of bullshit about how that's not good. It's no different than a car salesman telling you why you shouldn't visit his competitors. Therapists are amazing people, but not all are created equal. It is a talent that some have more than others.<p>I tried out a few and I had this one lady who was mediocre and just took forever to get anywhere with. Another lady, can't remember her name, but she was amazing, an African American woman who showed up in this beautiful Cadillac and just through questioning read me like a book.<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have a lot of money and I hated how they spread out treatment over long periods of time. Rather than getting over your issues in a few weeks or months it can take years if you see them just 1 hour a week like they suggest. Maybe they're busy with other patients but this is why people go to a therapist for years. YEARS. Instead of a few months to address issues.<p>After seeing a few therapists and reading about therapy methods online I think I learned the method to their magic.<p>A Therapist is basically a person that is trained to shut up and listen to you better than any friend or parent can. They carefully craft their sessions so they can get you to solve your own problems and understand your own issues. It is unethical for them to tell you what to do or give you advice. So they basically ask you deeper and deeper questions so that you can understand, acknowledge, and normalize to your own issues. The problem with talking to friends and loved ones is that they react to your problems and issues rather than listening and understanding. They love you but that doesn't mean they know how to help you. That, and they offer you advice based on their own limited understanding of your problem, issue, or situation. In other words they're giving you advice that they themselves would like to be given rather than advice that's right for you.<p>And like I said earlier, there's problems and issues. Problems can be solved, issues can never be solved. They can only be admitted, acknowledged, understood, and normalized to. Being born short and feeling insecure about it is an issue, losing your legs in an accident that wasn't your fault and being angry with the world is another issue. And therapists are perfect for that.<p>CBT (Cognitive Behavoiral Therapy): <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/about-cognitive-psychotherapy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/about-cognitive-psychothera...</a><p>Just google away and read as much as you can on the topic. There's lots of resources all over the place and no one resource is a waste of time. They all help.<p>I'm really running out of time, but real quick:<p>=== Getting over Body Dysmorphic Disorder (about 9 months) the uncontrollable fear that you are so atrociously ugly that you are causing others to feel discomfort when they see you. And the uncontrollable urge to hide from everyone. ===
- Realizing that the more I look in the mirror the worse it gets.
- Covering up the mirrors and not looking in them for days to weeks on end and seeing how good it feels to not care.
- Acknowledging that me being ugly isn't ruining my life, it's my reaction to me being ugly that is ruining my life.
- Seeing how wonderful life is without worry over my appearance.
- Acknowledging that Everyone has facial flaws and assymetrical features.
- Acknowledging that my mind is playing tricks on me, it's magnifying my facial flaws more than anyone can realistically notice. I can't trust my eyes.
- The discovery that if I glance in the mirror really quickly and look away, I don't look bad at all. It's when I stare into my own image that my brain visually picks out my flaws and assymetry and brings attention to them.
- Staring at pictures of other people's faces for several minutes allows me to see the flaws come out in their face the same way they do in mine.
- The startling realization that everyone is ugly if you look hard enough!!! HOLY SHIT!
- Admitting that there are people uglier than me and I should be happy with what I have.
- Understanding that even though I am not attractive I still need to live and be happy.<p>Eventually these understandings lead to me simply not caring anymore. I broke the pattern of thought that lead to my unhappiness. I went from living in my room for years, going out only at night, always wearing a hat, to not giving a damn. I didn't convince myself that I'm somehow a gorgeous person. I just convinced myself into accepting that ""who cares if I'm ugly, I have 45 years of life left and I'm not going to life this way."". And little by little it all just went away. There's a lot more to it but I'm short on time. And this isn't the place to be posting valuable info that's going to be forgotten in 2 days.<p>=== Getting over regret ===
Also who the hell am I to be upset?! There's so many people in terribly neighborhoods with parents that didn't love them, and shitty jobs, etc... When I compare my life to the life someone's living as a slave in a 3rd world country, or an undeveloped nation, or just someone else living down the street... When I look at all the opportunities and freedoms I have, I just feel like a little bitch for being upset while having so much that others don't have.<p>The more I got out and visited other countries and cities the happier I became. When you're surrounded by successful people and constant news about Mark Zuckerberg and Kevin Rose it can make you feel like dirt. But when you compare your life to the majority of people who are stressed out, living in an ugly neighborhood, working awful jobs, with kids to raise. Damn you feel good about where you are in life, and you wouldn't trade it for anything.<p>So before you complain about your situation, you need to go hear about other people's situations. Either that or get your ass sent to North Korea for a month, you'll come back REAL happy with your life.",1359269743

5123460,comment,5123289,5123289,2,0,orionblastar,,,"First this shows that Jobs was a class-act. Instead of responding to the insult with another insult or calling him wrong, Jobs admitted he didn't know much about OpenDoc (He was not at Apple when it was invented) and could not find a way to make enough use of it for Apple to earn money (Apple was losing money on it) and that he learned from past mistakes not to invent the technology first and then market it, but instead cater to what the user needs and fill that need and make it a good experience for the customer.<p>What Jobs was doing for the past several years before returning to Apple was building up Next and Pixar, the technology at Next saved Apple by evolving into Mac OS X and also merging with Mac OS technology.<p>OpenDoc was Apple's answer to the Amiga IIF (Intelligent Interface Format) and Microsoft's OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) it allowed different software to share document objects, pictures, and the like between software and even platforms. Apple had problems with it using too much memory and could not find a good use for it. MS-Office used OLE to share Word, Excel, Powerpoint etc objects between applications. I programmed with it to control Word objects and other objects and exchange data, fill in Word templates with data from SQL Server for mailing lists and cover letters for FAX transmissions and other things.<p>Jobs was right to terminate OpenDOC, the Apple Laserwriter, the Apple Newton and other projects because Apple could not sell them and they cost more money to support than they brought in. Other companies made laser printers cheaper than Apple, even if Apple had a laser printer out first. The Newton didn't quite work correctly in handwriting recognition, and the Palm Pilot worked better than the Newton. OpenDoc wasn't finished and was using up resources and money at Apple that Jobs needed to divert to other things in order to save the company.<p>I can see why this guy thought Jobs was a jerk or a phony, Jobs didn't know what OpenDocs could do and he admitted to it, sometimes you just don't know things. I guess the guy liked OpenDoc and wanted to see it continue. Apple also had Cyberdog and other projects like MKLinux that they canceled. Good ideas yes, but they just didn't bring in enough money. Jobs learned to innovate to the customer experience based on the customer's needs. The customer did not need or want OpenDoc, the Newton, The LaserWriter, MKLinux, Cyberdog, etc so Jobs had to cut them out. Then replace them with things the customer did want and need like a lower cost Macintosh called an iMac, the iPod music player and the iTunes music store, a new Macintosh operating system called Mac OS X, the Safari web browser, etc. Those happened to do better and earn more money for Apple because the customer had a better experience with them and it filled their needs and wants.",1359269483
5123459,comment,5123022,5123299,13,0,carbocation,,,"> I wrote a post about why GATK - one of the most popular bioinformatic tools in Next Generation Sequencing should not be put into a clinical pipeline:<p>I've seen you link to your blog post a couple of times now, and I still think it's misleading. I do wonder whether your conflict of interest (selling competing software) has led you to come to a pretty unreasonable conclusion. (My conflict of interest is that I have a Broad affiliation, though I'm not a GATK developer.)<p>In your blog post, you received output from 23andme. The GATK was part of the processing pipeline that they used. What you received from 23andme indicated that you had a loss of function indel in a gene.  However, it turns out that upon re-analysis, that was not present in your genome; it was just present in the genome of someone else processed at the same time as you.<p>Somehow, the conclusion that you draw is that the GATK should not be used in a <i>clinical</i> pipeline. This is hugely problematic:<p>1) It's not clear that there were any errors made by the GATK. Someone at 23andme said it was a GATK error, but the difference between ""user error"" and ""software error"" can be blurred for advantage. It's open source, so can someone demonstrate where this bug was fixed, if it ever existed?<p>2) Now let's assume that there was truly a bug. Is it not the job of the entity using the software to check it to ensure quality? An appropriate suite of test data would surely have caught this error yielding the wrong output. Wouldn't it be as fair, if not more so, to say that 23andme should not be used for clinical purposes since they don't do a good job of paying attention to their output?<p>Your blog post shows, for sure, a failure at 23andme. Depending on whether the erroneous output was purely due to 23andme or if the GATK had a bug in production code, your post shows an interesting system failure: an alignment of mistakes at 23andme and in the GATK. But I really don't think it remotely supports the argument that the GATK is unsuitable for use in a clinical sequencing pipeline.",1359269424

This was never really an issue since browsers (closest thing we have to a [Hyperlink-aware] client) always rolled out new upgrades, it's an even less of an issue now with todays auto-updating browsers.

Here's a few teachable moments:<p>One customer who ran MySQL on windows experienced data loss after a historic MySQL crash left them with a corrupted MyISAM table, which caused mysqldump to SILENTLY exit before the dump was complete.  Their dumps only had the tables up to the corrupted one.  They had been saving those dumps for months, but never testing them.  When the server eventually gave up the ghost they found that none of their dumps were good.  Lesson:  1. ALWAYS test your dumps.  2. NEVER trust MyISAM.<p>Another customer, smart enough to use InnoDB but not smart enough to change the MySQL defaults let one database get too large and found they couldn't shrink any of their databases because unless you use innodb_file_per_table InnoDB won't ever relinquish space even if you delete all the rows in your tables even after ""optimize table"". Lesson:  1. ALWAYS use innodb_file_per_table if you plan to keep the database for a long time.  2. Periodically run mysqlcheck optimize or optimize table to actually reclaim deleted space.<p>I've also helped customers rewrite their applications to avoid the ""Total number of locks exceeds lock table size"" problem.  What is that?  Well, even if you use database level locks the number of rows a transaction can alter is still limited by the server's memory buffer pool size.  Lesson:  1.  Know your working set.  Make sure your application checks the server's buffer pool size via SHOW VARIABLES and is smart enough to avoid large transaction updates.  2. Use a large buffer pool size whenever you can.<p>Coming from a PostgreSQL background, these came as total surprises to me.  I've never been completely happy with PostgreSQL's transaction id wraparound issues but I have yet to experience anything like the problems I've observed with MySQL.",1359268852

The server has to bind to that media type (i.e. generate HTML).<p>This is a subtle thing for API developers as we mostly just have the HTML web as the big success story for HATEOAS, and haven't done this as much for machine to machine communication...  But as an example, the  Google crawler is an example of a non-browser that took advantage of the HATEOAS for browsers and built a new application around it that took advantage of the genericness of HTML.  i.e. it didn't have to develop an API to each website, it just  understood the difference between the links embedded in <A> tag, <IMG> tag and <FORM> tag, and can traverse the links that help it improve its search index.<p>One of the closer attempts to HATEOAS was Facebook and the Open Graph protocol, attempting to describe social data through link relations in a way that's completely independent of specific clients & server implementations.<p>The limiting factor to HATEOAS in practice for API developers is the lack of programming model & tooling for describing & linking API actions together on the Web, which is something actively being experimented over at RESTfest, the W3C REST workshops, etc.  There's HAL for example, <a href=""http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html</a>",1359268418

This quote is laughable: ""There are only two computationally difficult problems in bioinformatics, sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.""<p>- As a bioinformatician, I feel sorry for this guy. Just like any other field, there are shitty places to work. If I was stuck in a lab where a demanding PI with no computer skills kept throwing the results of poorly designed experiments at me and asking for miracles, I'd be a little bitter too.<p>- Just like any other field, there are also lots of places that are great places to work and are churning out some pretty goddamn amazing code and science. I'm working in cancer genomics, and we've already done work where the results of our bioinformatic analyses have <i>saved people's lives</i>. Here's one high-profile example that got a lot of good press. (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-treatment-for-leukemia-glimpses-of-the-future.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/health/in-gene-sequencing-...</a>)<p>- I'm in the field of bioinformatics to improve human health and understand deep biological questions. I care about reproducibility and accuracy in my code, but 90% of the time, I could give a rat's ass about performance. I'm trying to find the answer to a question, and if I can get that answer in a reasonable amount of time, then the code is good enough. This is especially true when you consider that 3/4 of the things I do are one-off analyses with code that will never be used again. (largely because 3/4 of experiments fail - science is messy and hard like that).  If given a choice between dicking around for two weeks to make my code perfect, or cranking out something that works in 2 hours, I'll pretty much always choose the latter.  (""Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming."" --Donald Knuth)<p>- That said, when we do come up with some useful and widely applicable code, we do our best to optimize it, put it into pipelines with robust testing, and open-source it, so that the community can use it. If his lab never did that, they're rapidly falling behind the rest of the field.<p>- As for his assertion that bad code and obscure file formats are job security through obscurity, I'm going to call bullshit. For many years, the field lacked people with real CS training, so you got a lot of biologists reading a perl book in their spare time and hacking together some ugly, but functional solutions. Sure, in some ways that was less than optimal, but hell, it got us the human genome. The field is beginning to mature, and you're starting to see better code and standard formats as more computationally-savvy people move in. No one will argue that things couldn't be improved, but attributing it to unethical behavior or malice is just ridiculous.<p>tl;dr:  Bitter guy with some kind of bone to pick doesn't really understand or accurately depict the state of the field.",1359267885

You might be surprised how many are actually sympathetic to your concerns.<p>I'm not dismissing this author's concerns: to do that would really require knowing the molecular biology field (which is more than sequencing, it turns out).

(Django would be fine too, but one of our core guys has done rails forevs.) We still use Node as a critical part of infrastructure, but now it's relegated to message bus / socket.io-ey stuff. (Talks with rails via redis pubsub.)<p>So yes, you can totally do your entire stack on Node... but you have to make a lot of decisions. If you're someone like TJ (the guy behind express) and you're comfortable making lots of decisions yourself, it's extremely great.<p>FWIW for Node noobs, Express is just like Sinatra.

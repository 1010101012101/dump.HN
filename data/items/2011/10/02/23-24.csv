I'm using the most recent version from git.<p>To give a few examples of the bugs I encounter every day:<p>1. If you use it to auto-complete css files and you want to type ""text-shadow"" the moment you hit the dash the text gets replaced with ""text-align"". So if you type quickly you end up with ""text-alignshadow:"". The second time you type text-shadow it does work. This goes wrong for all definitions that contain a dash because SublimeCodeIntel (or the libraries it depends on) considers a dash a separator and separators trigger code completition.<p>2. It autocompletes on empty matches. If you start typing and for one reason or another the auto complete window pops up (and it does so automatically) and you hit space, or colon, any other separator what you just typed gets replaced with the topmost match in the completion list (even if 0 characters match).<p>3. I think it messes with my undo/navigation buffers, but I'm not quite sure.<p>4. The python completion crawler keeps reindexing and reindexing. So in practice the Python completion is nearly useless. It also doesn't give hints for parameter order (which I consider the most valuable hints by far) even though Komodo does (the library is ported from Open Komodo afaict)<p>5. ST crashes a few times a day after installing this plugin. Not 100% sure if it's to blame, though.<p>6. Unlike Komodo it doesn't index jQuery properly.<p>These issues aren't dealbreakers though. I just hit escape whenever the auto-complete window pops up.",1317598615

Bluntly, the K-12 teachers don't know anything worth much serious study or effort.<p>The best can hope for from a K-12 school is that it will do no harm.<p>Find a school that has a nice 'social atmosphere' and otherwise is RELAXED, e.g., with as little homework as possible.<p>Then for the real learning, have your children do that at home -- evenings, weekends, summers, and/or school study hall.<p>What materials?  Sure, academically by far the crown jewel is just math.  So, get them through math to the college sophomore level ASAP.  The next best subject is physics.  So, get them through freshman physics based on calculus ASAP.  How?  Get the best texts (good used copies are FINE, especially for the math) and work through them.  If need some help, ask some friends who know the material well and/or find an appropriate, helpful college prof.  Or have one parent enroll in, say, a community college course and there learn enough to guide their children and be able to ask the prof questions.<p>After math and physics, emphasize writing, say, letters, notes, blogs, whatever.<p>Sure, get 'computer literacy' and also learn the basics of programming.<p>Then emphasize geography, history, and art history.  For English literature, at least learn about the basics of 'drama' and 'formula fiction' and touch on the more famous works.  For as many of the works as can, start by watching a movie of the work.  For more in drama, understand how movie and TV dramas work.<p>Somewhere get some basic coverage of 'people and personality', especially about human emotions.  E.g., lacking anything else, read E. Fromm, 'The Art of Loving'.<p>For more, have the child take some community college courses, e.g., biochemistry and biology.<p>For more, look at the International Baccalaureate program and pick and choose from that or, maybe, just go through the whole thing.<p>During the last 2-3 years of the 'high school' time, review what else, if anything, is required to do well on the SAT tests.<p>For more?  Maybe learn piano?<p>Likely could study accounting and take the CPA exam.   A CPA would be nice to have.<p>For more?  Jump into college material at the junior level and keep going.  Get through college ASAP and then go for graduate or professional school.<p>For K-12?  Don't ask for much and mostly just circumvent it.",1317598162

I merely disagree that we should label them ""wrong"", since I think that doing so expects too much of the individuals.

In a big city there are a few really good ones and a bunch of mediocre ones.<p>- A school have to accept anyone living in a proximity, but it may also accept anyone else. So the good ones set up entry exams. Mediocre ones enroll everybody.<p>- I guess there are some bad schools, some really poor ones, but there are probably none or a very few ""failing"" ones, with meaning as in article.<p>By the way, where do illegal immigrants' children go to?",1317596530

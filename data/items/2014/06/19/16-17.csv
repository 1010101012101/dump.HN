7917088,comment,7916160,7916410,4,0,gbhn,,,"Thanks. I agree this is a very valuable case, as so many horrible software patents boil down to &quot;this common thing everyone knows, but inna fone!&quot; Software people have understood this for a long time as a completely unacceptable mis-use of the patent system, and it&#x27;s nice to get that translated to an SC decision.<p>To rant a sec, how many times will the federal circuit need to be slapped upside the head on these issues before they get it through their skulls that their whole permissive approach to patent law is just fundamentally unconstitutional, and they need to adapt their philosophy, or the SC will continue to apply the boot to them?

They know something is real. Yet, especially if they are caught in its hooks, they watch how law can be applied such that results are absurdly divorced from the reality they know.<p>I think this is maybe overly harsh. The plaintiffs in CLS v. Alice weren&#x27;t trying to obtain a result &quot;divorced&quot; from reality. Their argument was simply that 101 is written broadly and should be interpreted broadly (i.e. judicially created exceptions should be interpreted narrowly). There&#x27;s no truth--just a statute of Congress that is amenable to differing interpretations. Some of those interpretations are favorable to some people, and others to other people.

To understand the difference between &quot;patent-eligible&quot; and &quot;patentable&quot;, if you invent a car colored red, it&#x27;s patent-eligible because a car is an articles of manufacture<p>101 does not (and much more does not <i>only</i>) require that something relate to &quot;an articles of manufacture&quot; to be patent-eligible, it requires it to be an invention of a &quot;new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof&quot;<p>It is quite arguable that, assuming <i>cars</i> exist, a &quot;red car&quot; is, to the extent that it is <i>new</i> not <i>useful</i>, and to the extent that it is <i>useful</i> not <i>new</i>, and therefore patent ineligible.<p>So, no, while I agree that your analogy may be relevant, I don&#x27;t think it illustrates that the Supreme Court is confusing patent eligibility with patentability. I think <i>you</i> are reading patent eligibility far too broadly.<p>> 102 is novelty<p>Its true that 102 has specific novelty requirements on top of the patent-eligibility requirements in 101, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that things don&#x27;t need to be &quot;new and useful&quot; under Section 101 before one even needs to consider whether they meet the specific novelty rules in Section 102.",1403196776

Some algorithms simply match hardware well (high concurrency, low-complexity control flow, able to stream through data without complex state). These are often algorithms that do not fit general-purpose CPUs well (cache hierarchy wasted on streaming; lots of control overhead; low core counts relative to FPGA-level parallelism).

7917045,comment,7913183,7913183,3,0,aberrant,,,"Each year for the past 3-5 years me and my friends have been getting together for a weekend to play a few years of WWII. The game that we have been mostly playing is Columbia Games&#x27; Eastfront II, which covers the eastern war with Germany and Soviet Russia. It&#x27;s basically a hex-based map with different terrains, rivers, weather changes, HQ-driven troop mobilization and combat - the rules are abstract but not overly so to uphold an enjoyable immersion. The game also employs fog of war with thick wooden standing unit pieces, which certainly adds to the excitement.<p>The game is advertised for 2 players, but we went ahead and modded the rules for 6 players + a referee. We made both sides consist of 3 field commanders plus a supreme commander. We looked at the map and divided it into 3 parts: the north, the middle and the south. For each part of the map, a German field commander and a Soviet counterpart would sit against each other and hold command of their own area. They saw only units that moved on their map. We decided that each 4 turns (a turn was a fortnight) the field commanders could all go have a meeting with their supreme commander, discuss strategy and synchronize information. We usually set these meetings to last for about 10-15 minutes.<p>The role of the supreme commander was to dole out repair points plus reinforcements and to send messages to their field commanders. Each turn the supreme commander could send a message to all of his subordinates, and each turn all of his field commanders could send one message to their supreme commander and one message to their fellow field commander. A message could be intercepted with a possibility of 1/6. Intercepting the message meant that the referee would toss a die and if it turned out one, he would take it to the enemy supreme commander without the sender knowing about it until the next meeting.<p>As an addition, the supreme commander had a map, but he had nothing in it except his own unit, which was good for moving singular units, sending paratroops and air strikes. The supreme commander would also get all the dead units brought out to him when units started dying. You would definitely know things were bad when infantry that were at the edge of Moscow 3 turns ago (or so you recall...) were handed to you by the referee!<p>Last year we upped the ante and tried out EuroFront II by Columbia Games. It was an epic attempt to play the final year of the war with the whole map of Europe, the winner being the one who holds the most Victory Cities (historically notable European cities) in their supply network by May 1945. With over a dozen players we anticipated problems in our message delivery system, which mainly consisted of a two guys gathering a bunch of papers from players and throwing dice for each message per turn per player side.<p>We opted for an easier solution and I set out to build a simple messaging system. It was a horrible PHP Slim-based Bootstrap webapp, with business rules written in postgresql functions and code structure being an implementation of pasta. I suspected it would be a maintaining nightmare (and it sure was!), but it worked without a problem during that weekend. Everyone loved it, including our refs&#x27; feet.<p>This year the game is Eastfront II and the messaging is modified for two player sides. We will also allow messages to pass through to their original recipient even if they are captured. With this we will experiment whether the turns will become more interesting for the players whose messages are always captured.<p>Based on this horrid ad-hoc prototype of mine, I&#x27;m currently working on building a more generic, a rule-based messaging system for our guys. Definitely more maintainable this time, promise.<p>Ps. For what it&#x27;s worth, the ultimate alpha nerd war game seems to be The Campaign for North Africa. I will invite you to read the description of the game as described in Board Game Geek [0].<p>[0] <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/the-campaign-for-north-africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/the-campaign-for-nor...</a>",1403196517

And it&#x27;s essentially the point the plaintiffs made in this case: the &quot;abstract principle&quot; exception to subject matter eligibility should be construed narrowly, given the broad wording of 101 and the fact that it&#x27;s a judicially-created exception.<p>But, invalidating this patent on 101 grounds versus 103 grounds is not the same. Subject matter eligibility is something that can be ruled on in a motion to dismiss, In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 951 (Fed. Cir. 2008), while obviousness will generally need to wait after claim construction. It should be possible to knock out patents that claim a fundamental practice in any field as early as possible.<p>You can make other distinctions between &quot;a fundamental practice&quot; and &quot;prior art,&quot; too. In the field of cooking, do we have to point out prior art for making a roux, or do we just accept that someone, perhaps many someones independently, did it sometime long ago, but it&#x27;s so established now that it might as well be a fundamental law of the field?<p>Over time, the Supreme Court has been beefing up 101 as a bar to patent eligibility. Is the interpretation in CLS v. Alice the one that&#x27;s most faithful to the text of the statute? Probably not.

It is sufficient for it to be a &quot;fundamental economic practice&quot; or &quot;longstanding commercial practice,&quot; like the concept of &quot;risk hedging&quot; in Bilski. (Slip. Op. at 10)</i><p>If your quote is accurate, and they applied the same logic as Bilski, this sounds like they&#x27;re conflating <i>patent eligibility</i> (101) and <i>patentability</i> (102, 103 etc.) again. To understand the difference between &quot;patent-eligible&quot; and &quot;patentable&quot;, if you invent a car colored red [1], it&#x27;s <i>patent-eligible</i> because a car is an articles of manufacture i.e. it satisfies 101. But it&#x27;s not <i>patentable</i> because red cars have been around forever, i.e. it fails 102.<p>For those of you following along at home, 101, 102 and 103, etc. are bars that patent claims must clear to be valid. 101 is &quot;patent eligibility&quot;, i.e. it excludes things like laws of nature and &quot;abstract&quot; ideas. 102 is novelty, i.e. it excludes things found in the prior art. 103 is non-obviousness, i.e. it excludes things that are <i>obvious</i> (note: not &quot;trivial&quot;) combinations of existing prior art. These are long-standing principles for judging patents, each providing a distinct criteria for judging and invalidating a patent, and this arrangement has a long, well-known and mostly consistent history behind it.<p>Now essentially, the SC is saying &quot;prior art&quot; can sometimes make something an &quot;abstract idea&quot;. You don&#x27;t have to be a patent lawyer to see that this does not really make sense.<p>This patent is obviously invalid, but we already have the tool for invalidating it, and that&#x27;s section 102: a &quot;longstanding commercial practice&quot; or &quot;fundamental economic practice&quot; clearly falls under the umbrella of prior art -- things we already knew.<p>By mixing 102 analysis with 101 analysis, they&#x27;re just &quot;muddying the water&quot; even more. I&#x27;m guessing this is going to make the PTO&#x27;s and Federal Circuit&#x27;s job even harder and more inconsistent.<p>1.

Those patents were ridiculous.<p>Part of my day job is figuring out how to go about automating or &quot;electronifying&quot; processes relating to financial trading and risk management. In other words, I look at things that people currently do manually (or decide in their heads) and I figure out how it can be codified into language or an algorithm that a developer can turn into code.<p>Patents like this (and plenty of similar patents that have been granted[1]) effectively try to claim ownership over the concept of automating what is usually (but not always) a pre-existing business process, using a computer. That&#x27;s not invention. It&#x27;s problem-solving. And it&#x27;s not like the person filing the patent is even solving the problem - they&#x27;re just patenting the <i>concept</i> of a solution to that problem.<p>In effect, they&#x27;re trying to patent my work output. It&#x27;s like someone filed a patent ten years ago on &quot;Methods and apparatus relating to the matching of people seeking temporary accomodation and householders who are willing to rent out their spare rooms&quot;, without ever actually having built implemented it, then popped up when Airbnb came along, saying &quot;Hey, we have a patent on that!

They know something is <i>real</i>. Yet, especially if they are caught in its hooks, they watch how law can be applied such that results are absurdly divorced from the reality they know. Our advocacy process has many fine elements and yet this is one of its tragic by-products: having the best and the brightest in the field become instruments in trying to obtain cynically-motivated decisions that further some narrow (usually economic) interest at the expense of truth and justice.<p>That has been happening for a long time now in the patent field as armies of very bright lawyers have found clever ways to concoct patents out of what really should be unpatentable ideas through the art of clever drafting.<p>Well, this decision gives top-down guidance to judges to cut through such dissimulation in the area of patents and to look at the reality by asking, in effect, &quot;is this <i>really</i> inventive or is it simply a product of the draftsman&#x27;s craft parading as being somehow inventive.&quot; That is the right question to ask in such cases and it should go a long way towards reining in some of the more absurd abuses of recent times.<p>The case in nonetheless only an incremental step building on solid precedent (as well-assessed by rayiner) and not a radical shift by the Court.<p>Many had hoped, for example, that this case could be used as a means of delivering a death-blow to <i>all</i> software patents on the grounds that they could all be labeled nothing more than basic mathematical algorithms that happen to apply to a computer. Yet, in its decision, the Court not only did not address this sort of argument but it also carefully emphasized the idea that it was to &quot;tread carefully&quot; in how it might choose to exclude even fundamental &quot;building blocks of human ingenuity&quot; (i.e., laws of nature, natural phenomena, abstract ideas) from patent eligibility &quot;lest this exclusionary principle . . . swallow up all of patent law.&quot; To me, this signifies that the cautious approach signaled in <i>Bilski</i> - that is, that of gradually cutting back on the excesses spawned in the past two decades in the area of patent-eligible subject matter - will continue. So don&#x27;t hold your breath awaiting any court-driven abolition of software patents generally. That will have to await a legislative solution, if it is to come about at all.",1403193853

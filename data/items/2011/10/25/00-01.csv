The characteristics that make it suitable (in your mind) for wealth transfer are because it's being used as a pseudo currency.  By utilizing it to transfer wealth, you are also affecting the currency side - which matters.  If it became only a method to transfer wealth (no wealth stored), then there should be no demand for it.  At most the interest in it would be the difference of transferring money in regular currency.  But it's not used that way currently, but its market is so small that people who try to use it to transfer wealth could/do in fact manipulate its value even in real time.",1319503761

But one could argue that bike lanes attract cyclists who haven't learned or thought about safe cycling, whereas the unmarked street scares that demographic away.<p>The problem city planners are having is that they want to be ""bike friendly"" in every way except educating road users.  Some stripes on the road don't make cycling safe.  Cyclists that think carefully and act predictably do, and no stripe on the road is ever going to do that.<p>We need drivers education classes that cover driving from the perspective of a cyclist.  This will ensure that when drivers want to ride their bike, they do it safely, and it will ensure that drivers know to share the road with bicycles.  (I would take it a step further and require licensing for bicycle-only drivers, but that is too unpopular to ever happen.)",1319503515

3152240,comment,3149320,3152085,3,0,jrockway,,,"This is the sad reality of being a cyclist: we are the neglected middle child.  In the eyes of the law, we are vehicles.  In the eyes of motor vehicles, we are an annoyance that slows them down.  So, the motor establishment builds separated bikeways for us and tries to use the law to force us to use them.  Then pedestrians find these bikeways convenient and pleasant, and make them so dangerous for cyclists as to be essentially unusable.  Then they post to HN (or whatever) and complain about all the bikes using the bikeways and how dangerous this is for their pleasant afternoon walk.<p>Personally, I don't believe in advocating for bikeways for this reason.  Bikes will never get to use them, and if they cross traffic at all, they are death traps (because drivers don't look for objects moving as fast as bicycles on the sidewalk when they are turning).  The only exception is the lakefront trail because it has a total of 12 street crossings in 20 miles (4 of them in the last mile of the north side, two that have essentially no traffic, and two in the last mile on the south side).  This property makes it safe to use.  All it needs is a really nice running path and sidewalk closer to the lake (so that pedestrians won't even want to use it), and finally you have a bicycle expressway, one of the few places anything in Chicago can go 10 miles in 30 minutes.  This will never happen, though, because it will cost money and because the recreational cyclists will force the pedestrians off the pedestrian-only part onto the bike-only part.  Sigh.<p>I think the best general solution is what Chicago does: a lot of streets have a picture of a bicycle painted onto the right traffic lane and signs that say ""shared lane, yield to bicycles"".  This lets cars know that bikes are doing the right thing.  Then you just need bicycle driver education (I like ""Effective Cycling"") so that the cyclists stay safe and don't impede the flow of traffic.  Unfortunately, I've found that getting on a bicycle seems to mean turning off your brain and doing whatever feels right, which is often wrong.<p>(And that's why I don't like bike lanes, because they make doing the wrong thing feel like ""the law"".  ""There's that stripe, so I must make my left turn from the curb, that line on the road says so.""  Then they die and everyone whines about how dangerous cycling is.)",1319503157

Strictly speaking an MVP doesn't have to be a product, just some aspect of your business that you are uncertain about.<p>Let's say that one of your hypotheses is, ""What kind of demand is there for our service?"" There are many way to set up an experiment to test this out, but you need a very fast and cheap way of doing this with the minimum of resources.<p>One approach would be to create a very simple one-page site describing the service. And by simple I mean something something fast and dirty that takes hours to finish and not days. Obviously, the product that you're showcasing doesn't exist at all, you just have some copy, screen shots and a mailing list sign-up form where people can get notified about updates. To market the site, you could use popular approaches such as Google Adwords or just start bloging/tweeting about it.<p>Based on the data you gather - web statistics, mailing list sign-ups, emails, tweets, blog comments, etc - you should be able to answer the hypothesis with confidence.<p>So where is the MVP in all of this? Well, it would be everything required to answer the hypothesis, which in this case means setting up the site, mailing list, marketing, gathering data, etc. Once you can answer your hypothesis, the MVP is over and you can start working on a new hypothesis and MVP cycle.<p>Virtually any question you have can be solved this way. In fact, some people would insist that all fundamental business assumptions must be managed like this because this approach gives you the hard data you need to shape the future of your startup.<p>Although I have my doubts about the validity of The Lean Startup methodology, I think MVP as a concept is very potent. You should read Eric Reis book if you want to gain a better understanding of the methodology. For a much more practical approach, I recommend The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank [ <a href=""http://steveblank.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/</a> ]",1319502824

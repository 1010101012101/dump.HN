As an organization, they&#x27;ve acted within the bounds of the law and done exactly what they were supposed to do. This watchdog report is saying that the law is not in the interest of the people and it should be changed. But until that happens, the NSA is in the right to continue with business as usual.<p>From the article, quoting the report:<p><i>The program “lacks a viable legal foundation under Section 215, implicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only limited value,” the report said. “As a result, the board recommends that the government end the program.”</i><p>Now, you could mention that two out of the five representatives disagree with the idea that the program is illegal. That would be fair enough. Saying that the report finds nothing wrong law-wise with the program isn&#x27;t.<p>> This means that someone can&#x27;t be charged with violating a law that was not in effect at the time of the person&#x27;s action. ie, if the the speed limit is lowered to 50mph on Tuesday, you can&#x27;t be ticketed for having driven 55mph on Monday.<p>No doubt. But if you were to be caught red-handed doing warrantless wiretaps, on the other hand, retroactive immunity would automatically follow.<p>> In general, it&#x27;s bad for business. It&#x27;s difficult to plan for the future when a relatively small group of citizens can change how things work in a short time period.<p>I don&#x27;t know what ordinary US citizens think about having their privacy violated and have the head of the NSA lie about their activities. You may well be right about them not caring, it&#x27;s certainly the case here in Europe. But saying that changing the law would &quot;harm business&quot; is grotesque. I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find any support for the activities of the NSA in the US IT sector, short of security/defense suppliers, who bloody well know which side of the bread is buttered. The rest is scared of losing non-US customers and of the EU implementing stringent laws about transferring data outside of the EU borders.",1390462933

We didn&#x27;t know about these secret courts. We didn&#x27;t know the extent to which we were being spied on. The extent to which laws were being manipulated. Obama&#x27;s administration even claimed that their interpretation of these laws and therefore what they could do with them were too vital to national security to let us know!<p>Congress wouldn&#x27;t have had hearings where Keith Alexander had to explain and defend what he was doing if we already knew what he was doing. These wiretap laws also run contrary to an older Supreme Court ruling. You know how the government got around that? Bush&#x27;s administration claimed that Congress told him to use military power and he considered the NSA a military force so they could ignore the Supreme Court ruling. The FBI did the same.

This watchdog report is saying that the law is not in the interest of the people and it should be changed. But until that happens, the NSA is in the right to continue with business as usual.<p>Our constitution prohibits ex post facto law. This means that someone can&#x27;t be charged with violating a law that was not in effect at the time of the person&#x27;s action. ie, if the the speed limit is lowered to 50mph on Tuesday, you can&#x27;t be ticketed for having driven 55mph on Monday. This should apply to the NSA in the same way that it applies to citizens. We may not like the law, but we can&#x27;t call them criminals, dictators or all around bad guys for playing by the rules as they were written at the time.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that the NSA currently has the support of the people and the people&#x27;s representatives. If 80% of the country hated the law that allows blanket collection of business records then it would have been changed long ago. The issue is 50/50 at best among the people and much more lopsided in favor among members of congress. Changing the law will be difficult at this point, as it&#x27;s supposed to be. The whole point of a democratic bureaucracy is that they are stable and slow to change. We can&#x27;t routinely re-write laws that are disliked by 40% or even 50% of the people and lawmakers. In general, it&#x27;s bad for business. It&#x27;s difficult to plan for the future when a relatively small group of citizens can throw out the rules in a short time period.<p>If the NSA had some kind of effect on the life of the average citizen this law would be rescinded immediately. If that doesn&#x27;t end up happening, it&#x27;s going to take a lot more than personal interpretations of the constitution to get the federal government to give up capability and assets it spent a lot of time and money building. This law may change and the country may be better without it. If anything it will be a long time until the majority of people make up their minds or even form an opinion on this issue. Until then the NSA is going to what all of us do: pursue their goals while acting within the boundaries of the law.",1390462154

Here&#x27;s are some reasons why and why you might also be interested in his films:<p>(1) He described his art as poetry applied to cinema or &quot;sculpting in time,&quot; a fundamentally different conceptual idea of the cinematic art that he went to a great length to clarify (in a book of the same name, highly recommended).<p>(2) His use of color is incredible. Some films, especially stalker, are near black and white with incredibly vibrant and poignant uses of green. This is a bit like Bergman at his best, but even better.<p>(3) He was deeply religious in a &quot;mystical&quot; sense, with a lot of respect for past traditions, but not in a dogmatic sense and with appreciation for both Christian and pagan elements (see Andrei Rublev for both aspects)<p>(4) He knew other European traditions extremely well. Ivan&#x27;s childhood is a meditation on the war with Germany, including shots of Duehrer&#x27;s prints. Nostalgia involves his time in Italy traditions including Madonna cults and important artwork. Sacrifice has Shakespearean references, Rembrandt, Japanese samurai, and magical traditions. In general, his films are full of long shots of important pieces of Renaissance art with profound meaning.<p>(5) He spent a lot of time thinking about the integration of technology and the rest of life. Solaris is the futuristic spaceship version of this. Stalker is the apocalyptic version of this.<p>I think in a century Tarkovsky will rightly be credited as inventing a whole new type of cinema, his way of approaching it was fundamentally in tune with a &quot;mystical&quot; sense and integrated with other forms of visual art (i.e. the long gaze you have at a painting), and the punctuated, rhythmic reading of poetry.",1390461814

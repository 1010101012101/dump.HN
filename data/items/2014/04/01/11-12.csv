Apple can get away with it because their only costs are manufacture and licensing, and because they have high margins which can absorb a bit of a hit. If they were selling them, though, they&#x27;d presumably want to make a profit, and that profit would make the end product almost certainly the most expensive mobile chip on the market.<p>From a marketing point of view, too, it&#x27;d be a hard sell in Android-land. Apple has been very careful to steer clear of spec-oriented marketing, but can you imagine the less-sophisticated enthusiast market&#x27;s response to, say, the Galaxy S6 using a dual-core 1.3GHz chip instead of a quad-core 2GHz?",1396353530

To be allowed to visit your lifelong partner in hospital, for example?&quot;<p>Again I wouldn&#x27;t classify these as &#x27;basic human rights&#x27;. It&#x27;s disgraceful that people can&#x27;t avail of these benefits because of their sexuality and that should change. Like I said, I&#x27;m 100% against discrimination based on sexuality I&#x27;m just objecting to your use of the term &#x27;basic human right&#x27;.<p>I think the real issue here isn&#x27;t that gay people can&#x27;t get married in some places - it&#x27;s that anyone who does get married gets benefits that non-married people don&#x27;t get. For example if a heterosexual couple who had been in a lifelong relationship never got married they would also face the dilemma you presented of not being allowed to visit each other in hospital.",1396353447

Quantifying this is very hard and you run into cross-cultural problems which I think is your major objection to what I said.<p>Also a second real problem with your thesis occurs to me, namely that Chinese-Indonesian culture really stresses competitive sports, where the domination aspect is most heavy.  So it can&#x27;t be about discouraging domination.<p>What I do see, again, is a question of how individual production ties into family and community.  This is where the huge difference lies.  In this regard, unrestrained creativity is a threat to order, but so is self-motivation, because both of these become in tension IME with the familial approach to business decision making that we see, at least with my in-laws etc.<p>In essence what I see (from close-up mind you) is that Asians tend to be more risk adverse than Americans, far more concerned about credentials and school records, and far more aggressive about tying individual aspirations to family obligations.  I do think this has implications regarding innovation.<p>This is not to say there aren&#x27;t things I really appreciate about Asian culture.  The strong familial links has a very positive side to it, namely that adults don&#x27;t have to save up for retirement (that&#x27;s what kids are for) and therefore are more free to invest in the launch of their children.

The one thing that&#x27;s annoying is the occasional person who insists on carrying on their half of a conference call very loudly, but I don&#x27;t see that much.<p>I&#x27;ve had pretty good experiences with open floor plans in companies too.  They&#x27;ve never been the row-upon-row of adjacent tables depicted in the post, but close enough see/hear everything that&#x27;s going on.  In the open environment, a lot of the noise will probably be discussions about coding/design matters on other projects, or general office hijinx.  There are downsides to that, but there&#x27;s a lot of benefit too.  You don&#x27;t need to wait till the water cooler to see some matter needs discussion.<p>I can see how both the open floor plan and coffee shop environment will be distracting for some.

As I read the Internet on April 1 I just try to self filter out all the silly unbelievable garbage. Most news sites (including HN) are hardly worth reading April 1.<p>You know when someone who thinks they are funny insists on telling lame jokes, and the audience feels an obligation to give an acknowledging guffaw? It&#x27;s like an whole Internet day worth of that.<p>I feel like the Grinch Who Stole April Fools but really it has to be said.  If you&#x27;ve got it in mind to do some fine ol&#x27; foolin then maybe the classy thing to do is leave the foolin to others and spare us one more depressingly lame absurdity.",1396351085

The first is that things fit together in different ways.  When children are playing they are usually engaging in highly creative activity (provided it isn&#x27;t sitting in front of the video game console).  This activity is important to a whole range of things, and it includes things as diverse as self-motivation and invention.<p>For a culture to discourage play is to focus not so much on meritocracy so much as it is in quashing individualism both regarding internal motivation and innovation.<p>I say this even though I sincerely believe that innovation depends on details and that masters of a craft are the best able to innovate within it.  But unless you have a sense of empowerment and motivation to do this, this is significantly slowed down.<p>Again, this is just tackling the point on play.  I don&#x27;t think it is about meritocracy.  I think it is about the relationship between individual production and community.",1396351019

He also discuss some of the interesting companies on his portfolio. Starting his time as a venture capitalist in China, 2004, and witnessing the rise of the Chinese internet giants: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent with the upstarts, Xiaomi and Cheetah Mobile, Hans Tung offers a different perspective into the ever changing ecosystem of the Chinese mobile and web landscape and how mobile is now the common platform for both US and Chinese companies to compete for the next 2-3 billion out there in the other markets. He also shares with us interesting anecdotes on Xiaomi, with reflections on how Lei Jun and his team have built the company from the start till now, and the real back story to how Xiaomi hired Hugo Barra from Google. Lastly, he discuss how mobile is now the new platform where both US and Chinese companies will compete out there for the next 2-3 billion market.",1424048184

9054816,comment,9053286,9054668,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> The point isn&#x27;t the lines that contain &quot;yield from&quot;. It&#x27;s the lines that don&#x27;t contain &quot;yield from&quot;<p>What is the point though? Why does it matter where context switches happen (either CPU or IO ones). You are doing the job of the scheduler which is like being teleported back to Windows 3.1. Adding &quot;yield froms&quot; turns your functions into generators.  The job of code maybe is to update shopping carts or send tweets or something like that, now that function returns a generator and anything on top of it has to deal with it.<p>The original point, which I think you missed, is that the typical advantage of &quot;yield from&quot; (or deferreds, or callbacks) is that you don&#x27;t need to worry about synchronization. Look no mutexes, this is fantastic! Except that is wrong. As the application grows, top level code starts to look like:<p><pre><code>     r1 = yield from f1()
     r2 = yield from f2(r1)
     r3 = yield from f3(r2) 
     ...
</code></pre>
With callbacks it looks even uglier. That code is logically approaching the code that looks like:<p><pre><code>     r1 = f1()
     r2 = f2(r1)
     r3 = f3(r2)
     ...
</code></pre>
In a multithreaded program without mutexes.<p>Therefore this thing exists: <a href=""http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.interne...</a> and I had to use it often enough. Because what happens is two clients would start 2 concurrent callback chains, and if they start updating some shared data ( a database or internal structure ) you&#x27;ve got a data race and you need to use the DeferredSemaphore.",1424047995

One of the things we realized is that procedurally generated cities almost always feel &quot;wrong&quot; because real life cities generally have a mishmash of dozens of general architectural &quot;styles&quot; based on various quirks of history.<p>One example: in Cincinnati Ohio, working class houses in certain neighborhoods have <i>stained glass windows</i>. It&#x27;s usually only one or two small ones, but they&#x27;re there in certain neighborhoods because of a stained glass artisan &quot;scene&quot; that arrived on a wave of German immigrants. Another quirk about Cincinnati: there are lots of houses that are quite narrow for their plan area, because taxes were based on the width of the building on the street. There are quirks like these that cause a city to be a geographically differentiated patchwork of different styles.",1424047725

Fortunately the only actually mutating method at the moment is append, which is redundant with add but for the mutability, so I might just tear that out.<p>Required parentheses on functions are pretty unfortunate. I&#x27;m mainly trying to avoid the situation in Ruby where trying to access functions as first-class objects requires all sorts of weird syntactic overhead. Possibly I could have some kind of prefix operator, so (say) &obj.method would return the function object, and obj.method would call it?<p>I agree about the &#x27;:&#x27; &#x27;do/end&#x27; ugliness. Originally blocks were delimited by braces, but I think the Ruby-style delimiters look nicer. Frankly I&#x27;d prefer to get rid of the &#x27;:&#x27;, but for single-expression functions that looks pretty awful. I could do Haskell-style &#x27;=&#x27; (Haskell of course being where the &#x27;function-body-is-single-expression&#x27; thing came from), but<p><pre><code>    fn foo(x) = do
      ...
    end

is also pretty weird-looking; kind of like Scala&#x27;s function definitions, which I find really abrasive for reasons I can&#x27;t fully explain.<p>Binding &#x27;self&#x27; is also basically a compromise. Originally it was stored in the method, but that required copying each type&#x27;s methods (and each parents&#x27; methods) into an object on instantiation, which was a pretty much unacceptable performance hit. My thinking is that, whenever you&#x27;d want to pass a method &#x27;obj.method&#x27;, it&#x27;s equally possible to pass &#x27;fn (x): obj.method(x)&#x27;.<p>I need to rework the &#x27;try...catch&#x27; statements in any case; their current semantics are incredibly horrible (it wraps, then immediately calls, the try body in a temporary lambda).

I got into a pre series A startup for 90k a year (on a W9 rather than a W2 so -20% after taxes and computing no vacation or sick days) + .1% equity per month to make an iPhone app.  I had two co-workers who were sub par.  They left the company.  I&#x27;m currently taking over the rest of the programming (backend/web stuff).<p>The system I&#x27;m inheriting is pretty bad.  Security holes, bad EC2 setup and the web front end is unmaintainable.<p>I can handle the work but the time required to fix everything is significant and I feel underpaid.  I got promoted to VP of engineering but my pay and amount of stock I get didn&#x27;t increase.<p>We&#x27;re in the middle of raising series A.  We are strapped for cash until series A is completed.<p>I&#x27;m meeting with my CEO soon and would like to talk about a significant pay increase as well as more equity.  I don&#x27;t want to seem like a jerk and say I want at least $175k per year as well as .2% equity per month now or i&#x27;m gone since we&#x27;re in the middle of raising series A and I&#x27;m the only programmer.  I also don&#x27;t want to keep kicking the can down the road.<p>How do I go about asking for fair compensation?  How much money and equity would you guys ask for?  Anyone have any ideas like get 120k now and after series A raise it up to 175k?<p>Little more about myself.  Came from a top 15 CS program, placed in a couple programming competitions, was part of a company that previously exited as a back end dev, been programming for 17 years and I&#x27;d I&#x27;ve been at start-ups since I graduated in 2007.",1424045309

9054704,comment,9053693,9054522,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"It is mostly people not taking time to cook due in large part to a rushed lifestyle. Fresh vegetables are ubiquitous, diverse, and cheap. Also, in most parts of the US, you have to drive a significant distance to the grocery store; it is much easier to cook interesting food if you only need to walk down the street to get fresh ingredients.<p>One thing to understand is that the typical American diet tends to be regional and varies considerably across those regions. For example, where I currently live (Pacific Northwest) people eat relatively little processed food, in part because they have unbelievable access to fresh ingredients. On the other hand, when I lived in the central US, it was a blend of heavily processed food and fairly limited central/eastern European cuisine. This reflects what is available locally as well as the ethnic history of a region.<p>In my experience, some parts of the US have a much more diverse and widely available fresh vegetable selection than Europe. This is particularly true in the western US, which is where many vegetables come from. If you are lucky enough to live on the west coast of the US, you can buy a very wide range of fresh vegetables for almost no money all year long. What is available locally is seasonal but augmented by vast greenhouse operations and vegetables shipped in from other latitudes, which is simple in North America. In fact, the lack of vegetable diversity at any point in time compared to what I am accustomed to is one of my complaints about eating in Europe, especially in winter.",1424045182

There is relatively little demand for academic work. While tenure track professors can earn a decently reliable income, the fact that it&#x27;s possible (however unlikely) for a given Ph.D to get that level of job security fills thousands of grad students and Ph.D&#x27;s with false hope. So, just like people trying to break into Hollywood, they race to the bottom to accept shittier and shittier adjunct jobs. This is the world&#x27;s way of telling them that maybe they should go find something else to do for a living.<p>The only sustainable solutions will address the supply and demand issue:<p>1. Create more demand for academic work. For the sciences, this is actually a decent idea. I&#x27;m sure we could triple public spending on basic sciences and get enough socially useful return on it to justify the expenditure. A little harder to justify for the humanities.<p>2. Reduce the supply of academics. Produce fewer Ph.D&#x27;s. Then the remaining Ph.D&#x27;s will have the leverage to dictate better compensation, because they will be harder to replace.",1424045108

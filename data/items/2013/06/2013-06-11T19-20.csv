5864297,comment,5857025,5859646,6,0,tete,,,"Hmm, according to all kinds of measurements, indexes, etc. the most democratic, free, hight standard of living countries reside in northern Europe. Most of them don&#x27;t have much military. So somehow this comment is pretty flawed.<p>The US once was the most free countries and indeed helped and inspired others, but that was more than a hundred years ago. The problem is while other countries emerged (possibly because of mistakes, losing wars, being split, reunited, etc.) the US has had a few problems that got them stuck.<p>I think and it&#x27;s just my opinionated explanation. I might be completely wrong, but I think the biggest problem for the US where the two world wars and the cold wars. Basically it made the country/government learn that espionage, military, etc. is a good thing, because they only win. They win no just like the war itself, but they win control of people, they pretty much unite them, but even that is not all. The military system allows the US to do what other countries do with welfare. They reinvest tax money, the out it into families of veterans, have a huge military industry from weapons to mercenaries. It works. Just like it allows them to do heavy espionage in the name of national security.<p>On the other hand there is expensive education or bought education (VISA policies), not the best health care system, still a lot of weird stuff, like death penalty (an example of how the US is stuck), bad infrastructure (streets, internet, etc.) and a lot less liberties or equal treatment of sexes and &quot;races&quot; for example.<p>This is something that stabilizes the US. I don&#x27;t know, in a way it is a valid thing. Stability is good and there is pretty much no country that does so well that it should judge the US for that.<p>Another problem is that they tend to do overpropaganda, so they can&#x27;t really change. They had stuff like the cold war, so communists (Russians/Chinese) people are super evil. Also there were no other reforms. The two party system where both have pretty much opinion. That&#x27;s no way of choosing. For example the death penalty thing I mentioned. Republicans are pro, Obama is pro. So no movement in sight.<p>The US is also stuck in nationalism. Like really, do you know any other developed country that is so much into flag waving and where everyone is like &quot;Mall of America, Bank of America, X of America&quot;?<p>Like I said. It&#x27;s not bad. It brings stability, which is something people want, but it also means that progress simply stalls.<p>In this regard the US is actually quite the same as China or Russia. Big countries, which pretty much always the same government, lots of propaganda, lots of nationalism &quot;the others are all bad (or envious)&quot;, death penalty, secrecy, lots of military investment, our country is the best, etc.<p>It might also be a thing of size. There have been political-philosophical works about this, partially with practical implementation (The Breakdown of Nations).<p>However, as history tells us (see various empires) these things break down in bad ways. Sadly it usually means the next nation will become like this and won&#x27;t be any better at all. And yeah, I am not a friend of nations and stuff, but I am realist enough to know, no matter how long the US remains like that (yeah, I think it is trembling, but I think it&#x27;s far from falling) or whatever, this isn&#x27;t going to change. I also don&#x27;t think there can be any kind of utopia. It would be really cool if people just abandoned stuff, but no matter how wrong communists are. There is one thing they got correctly (but usually still don&#x27;t live after, else they wouldn&#x27;t be communists): It might be nice for a while, when everyone understands how shitty things were and how nice it is to just live together, but people forget that and then it really starts from the beginning.",1370980365

At this point after understanding what&#x27;s possible you might get some ideas about what you might want to do.<p>If you don&#x27;t have ideas yet that&#x27;s ok, but now you&#x27;re pretty well equipped to research what other people have been doing with your platform. You could build somewhat different alternatives to existing projects, or work on trying to contribute an extension to an existing project.<p>If just looking at projects doesn&#x27;t spark any ideas start talking to people. Start with people who might know something about your topic at your university, or reach out to individuals in the community.<p>The key to a research project is just getting interested in one idea or question. Once you develop a little curiosity about on little thing it&#x27;s like pulling on a thread that&#x27;s connected to a much larger tapestry. Maybe your original idea has already been done but you find something else that&#x27;s closely related that hasn&#x27;t been done. You&#x27;ll quickly be able to follow this tiny thread to a much larger world that will be of great depth and in general can be very interesting. If you have the diligence to carefully review existing work it&#x27;s not hard to steer yourself to a totally uncharted area (this is probably a lot of work for a senior thesis but if you find it fun then go for it).<p>Also don&#x27;t worry too much about originality. Re-creating something that already exists is a good learning experience, and might lead to other interesting ideas, like taking an existing thing and using it for a slightly different purpose. Just make sure to give credit where it&#x27;s due. This isn&#x27;t a PHD thesis and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be knocked for not making some brilliant original discovery. The key thing is to get started and follow your curiosity.",1370980057

Most of us aren&#x27;t geniuses. I&#x27;m not an Einstein, and I&#x27;ll never look good compared to him.<p>Next, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that vociferous a demand in the industry. Most of the industry still resists pairing, regardless of results. And certainly, nobody is saying that it&#x27;s impossible to be productive unless you pair.<p>Now, some positives for pairing. First, it&#x27;s a risk management approach. Businesses generally aren&#x27;t interested in maximizing productivity. They&#x27;re interested in minimizing risk. Don&#x27;t believe when they say otherwise, they&#x27;re full of crap. (To be precise, they&#x27;re interested in minimizing the APPEARANCE of risk more so than risk itself, but.) Depending too much on the results of individual programmers who could quit, be incompetent, or get hit by a bus is a business risk. By pairing, the knowledge gets distributed throughout the team. Moreover, it helps mentor junior programmers and integrate new staff.<p>Beyond that, I just find it a useful technique in many situations. Programming requires thinking on several levels at once. I&#x27;ve found it very effective for the driver to focus on the individual lines of code, while the kibbitzer keeps track of the big picture. It also helps keep you going when you hit a roadblock, rather than checking Twitter and coming back to life two hours later. So there are real productivity gains to be had.<p>Have you ever seriously TRIED pairing?",1370979033

Somewhat analogous to a data structure like that returned from stat, the numeric info level controls what structure is returned (or supplied).  Microsoft had a tendency to add new info levels that correspond to whatever the in-kernel data structures were in a particular release rather than longer term good design.<p>The general chattiness comes from their terrible clients like Windows Explorer (akin to Finder for Mac folk).

If you hand crafted the requests it would have 5 of them - open the file, get the size, read the zip directory from the end of the file, close it.  Windows XP sent 1,500 requests and waited synchronously for each one to finish.  Windows Vista sent 3,000 but the majority were asynchronous so the total elapsed time was similar.<p>I worked on WAN accelerators for a while where you can cache, read ahead and write behind, in order to provide LAN performance despite going over WAN links.

What is to stop the A.G. from publicly saying &quot;Yes, disclose away!&quot; and then to privately send one of those magic-do-anything-we-say requests saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t disclose X, Y, and Z.&quot;?  Or if we are given an accurate count today, what is to prevent the government from in the future secretly retracting that privilege?<p>I think in the end we can be satisfied by nothing less than some sort of &quot;Too Many Secrets&quot; Constitutional Amendment, stating clearly that no private citizen can be required or compelled to partake in a &quot;National Security&quot; cover-up, so that everyone currently bound up in the web of lies could speak up without fear of persecution.<p>That is what galls me as much as anything.  If the government wants to gather data and keep secrets, let them gather and keep them themselves.  Drafting people against their will into compulsory service in signals-intelligence, forcing them to lie to their loved ones and the world, and persecuting them for honesty, is absolutely amoral.",1370977397

Another segment of the population is worried about threats to their privacy/safety.  Only a rare fringe argue that knowledge/guns are inherently evil, but it&#x27;s also a rare fringe that admits that knowledge/guns can&#x27;t be used for evil.  For instance, I could use (data mining)/guns to (find southpaws to kill)/(kill southpaws I find). Those in favor of knowledge/guns tend to argue that the threats posed by knowledge/guns can really only be combated by more knowledge/guns.  For instance, knowledge/gun advocates argue that the only real security comes from using knowledge/guns to (locate threats)/(shoot threats).  Privacy/(Gun control) laws fundamentally restrict our ability to gather knowledge/guns.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not arguing that what the NSA did was right.  I&#x27;m pissed that the NSA spent my tax dollars collecting this beautiful data sent and won&#x27;t even let me read it.  I want to start data mining every e-mail you&#x27;ve sent, every website you&#x27;ve visited, and every location your cell phone has been.  If the thought of me doing that makes you uncomfortable, you now know how I feel about your guns.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t begrudge you your guns.  Just because they make me feel uncomfortable doesn&#x27;t mean that you lose your rights to own them.  In the same way, I hope that you respect my right to gather your personal information, even if it makes you uncomfortable.",1370977360

5863979,comment,5863619,5863619,4,0,drostie,,,"You could potentially affiliate with social networks in such a way as to leave a clear fingerprint; that is, you could be, both in your &#x27;anonymous&#x27; and &#x27;real&#x27; life, the only person who connects 20 different social groups together. This could be as simple as quoting song lyrics. If you tried to deliberately avoid this, then you could potentially be identified simply based on that -- &quot;these two people have too similar interests to <i>not</i> know each other&quot; or so.<p>Your very manner of speaking can reveal a lot about you. I vaguely remember hearing a cold reader say something like, &quot;the first thing I get to know about someone is their hands.&quot; Similarly, your word and spelling choices can inform others about your country of origin, and can potentially do much more than that.<p>Tor could have security issues, especially if you don&#x27;t keep it up-to-date. Even if it doesn&#x27;t have security issues, you could accidentally choose an entrance and exit node which are in cahoots and can thereby de-anonymize you. This applies less to hidden services, but still does apply. That is, the government could have compromised the hidden server, and thus might be able to correlate your activity.<p>Speaking of that, the times of day that you&#x27;re active can already narrow down what countries you may live in, and may reveal roughly when you go to work and when you come back. So, for example, if you&#x27;re using IRC over Tor, people could probably get a lot of information about you. Supposing that law enforcement has narrowed your real-life persona as a likely target, for example, they might just see if you join and part only when you&#x27;re home.<p>If you were, say, browsing Hacker News or some other site, this could possibly be identified simply by looking at the size of the chunks of incoming traffic. This would be more and more common for larger and larger files -- I would not recommend downloading large videos over Tor, and images could probably offer a similar fingerprint.<p>You could use an insecure application over Tor -- sending BitTorrent tracker requests over Tor (while downloading in the clear) is one of the most common. So, if you tried to start up your IRC client before the Tor proxy was up, and your client happened to detect that its proxy wasn&#x27;t working and tried to connect without one, that could compromise your identity pretty fast. For that matter, someone could potentially use an exploit against an out-of-date browser or operating system to turn on your webcam and take some pictures. For that matter, someone could hide a camera right behind you. You might consider only using Tor from within a bedsheet fort if you&#x27;re suitably paranoid.<p>More realistically, the fact that you&#x27;re using a bootable live distro could potentially be used to identify you; there aren&#x27;t so many people doing that and your Referer string might well be unique. For that matter, the fonts installed on your machine might be probed and unique. It&#x27;s worth checking this with EFF&#x27;s Panopticlick. If your use of Tor hidden services reveals &quot;he&#x27;s a Welsh male Debian and Tor user who likes this obscure band,&quot; you might be identifiable solely based on that, and it&#x27;s hard to be 100% sure that you have masked the fact that you are Welsh or male.",1370977317

I would describe the effect of revelations of this kind on people in Germany as a noticeable jump in one direction on a sentiment continuum, if that makes any sense.<p>The generation of currently 25 to 40 year olds here have grown up in an extremely US-influenced cultural environment. Imagine that there is this magically interesting and quite progressive place on earth and they broadcast from there on all TV channels all the time. That&#x27;s what it was like to grow up in the 90s in Germany.<p>Having grown up with a generally positive view of the US, the Iraq war was a decisive turning point for many people of that (i.e., my) generation. By the time Colin Powell presented his case before the UN, many Germans started to feel betrayed, because it seemed so obvious that an invasion was not the right thing to do (the GOOD GUY became a mere mortal). Older people that were familiar with the political games of the cold war might not have been surprised, but the young people definitely were. Since then for many Germans, the attitude towards the US is quite ambivalent. It is possible that this in some situations leads to unfair highlighting of wrongdoing on part of the US, but I&#x27;d say that by and large the effect is primarily that there is now interest in good news and bad news about the US.<p>Add to that, that many Germans feel extremely uneasy about intelligence gathering in general (think STASI), and you have a reason to assume that, at least in Germany, this thing will linger in the hearts and minds for a while.<p>It has to be noted, however, that this also means that the reaction in Germany cannot be generalized to the rest of Europe.",1370977254

8427950,comment,8425575,8427419,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Small children (and many adults; and to some extent everyone) overreact when they get stressed: they become angry, self-centered, and incapable of measured logical thinking; they interpret incidental or minor problems as calamities; they lose sight of context and feel insulted by normally harmless comments; they ascribe their stress to totally unrelated causes. When multiple people are involved, and more than one is stressed, you get horrible miscommunication, and shouting matches where both people are convinced that the other one is a jerk.<p>As people grow up, they can learn to control their emotional response, or at least learn non-destructive coping mechanisms. (For instance, leaving an argument alone until both parties have calmed down enough to think about what’s really at stake in the argument and what’s important and come up with solutions that both can agree to.) They can learn the true causes of their stress, and try to fix those, instead of blaming unrelated people or events.",1412787563

Yes, modern circuit breakers are now running unauditable and unupgradeable software! In addition, the prohibitive cost of these devices actually causes <i>fewer</i> circuits to be built out in new construction. The simpler solution would have been to stop running plastic-covered wires through wood-framed structures, but presumably the AFCI patent holders lobbied for such circuits not being exempt.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me started on California title 24, user-hostile shutoff timers, and sickly GU24)",1412786752

Most european so-called democracies lack representation of the elector, and we can thank the proportional list system for this.<p>This lack of representation, in combination with the imperative mandate to the party instead of to the electors in Spain causes that we have, lets say, 150 legislators from party X, 75 from party Y, and 30 from party Z. The leader of the X party is going to be PM, which means it&#x27;s going to execute the law. Law that he is going to decide(his legislators that he did put on the list).<p>In the spanish system we can get rid of the 
Parliament and the system wouldn&#x27;t be affected, I&#x27;ll prove it to you.<p>When the leader of party X votes Yes to one proposal, all of the X representatives vote always in the same direction. The same happens with the opposition. What this means is that we can get rid of all the legislators apart from the leader of X, Y and Z. The vote of X leader would value 150, vote of leader Y 75 and so on, and both us and the system wouldn&#x27;t notice.<p>We don&#x27;t need almost 500 representatives of their respectives leaders because their leaders are already present.

All the power plants, the transmission lines, the substations, the transformers, etc.  To the extent that renewable energy can displace peak load, it does reduce the need to upgrade the grid.<p>Thus, a <i>west-facing</i> solar panel can be good for the grid.

This isn&#x27;t PKI, or even shared-secret encryption like RSA; this is the client receiving an opaque blob and then passing it directly back to the server, and the server verifying the URL&#x27;s HMAC to prove that A. the non-HMAC part of the URL is byte-for-byte identical to the one the HMAC claims it is; and B. the HMAC contains the server&#x27;s secret.<p>I really like this approach, myself (it works really well in Erlang, where closures can be serialized like any other term), so I&#x27;ll argue in favor of it for a bit:<p>1. OS package managers (especially those that provide automatic security updates) are, effectively, arbitrary code execution limited solely by signature verification. If you don&#x27;t trust signature verification, you basically can&#x27;t trust OS update infrastructure.<p>And these are actually <i>less</i> secure than URL signing, when you think about it: with a signed URL, you are the signatory, and it&#x27;s very easy to know if you are you. With OS updates, you have to trust the OS manufacturer has itself granted trusts only to the right entities. (Microsoft could put an update signing key from law enforcement into Windows, letting them push automatic wiretap/rootkit &quot;updates&quot; to selected individuals, etc.)<p>In other words, the security of a system is derived from its weakest link—and there are links far weaker than URL signing.<p>2. People already do this a ton—deserializing an opaque blob of data signed by the server and then treating it as if it was something just sitting in the server&#x27;s memory to begin with. Where? In &quot;signed-cookie session storage&quot;, the default session mechanism of both Rails and Django. The only difference is that you&#x27;re putting the information in the URL (where it belongs, in this case) instead of the session—although you could just as well store a continuation table in the session, and then reference it from the URL, if you liked.<p>Okay, there&#x27;s also the fact that you&#x27;re storing a serialized closure instead of a public route—but in <i>business</i> terms, that&#x27;s no more dangerous to e.g. the valuable information in your database than storing the user&#x27;s effective UID in signed-cookie session storage, presuming you have administrator-role users in your system with the ability to delete that data.<p>The one difference might be if the limited set of all your public API endpoints acts as a slapshod &quot;sandbox&quot; for your server, with you trusting that sandbox to protect your system. Which is to say, if your server can do more harm by executing arbitrary code than an administrator user can do by sending messages to it, you should really look into Docker/BSD jails/etc.",1412785548

The api structure requiring you to do 3+ calls. The exponential call back time (this is not a good idea, have fun with weird bugs). That you&#x27;ve made your own json objects. That you&#x27;ve used PUT for a pretty tenuous reason. That you&#x27;ve put all the urls in some config file or something, so the code isn&#x27;t particularly clear at what it&#x27;s doing.<p>The ruby & javascript are more terse because those languages are, but they aren&#x27;t that much better.

8427746,story,,,1,0,leeoniya,"Ask HN: How do you track new issues in your GitHub repos?",,"Hi guys,<p>I have a problem that started back when Github redesigned their notification system...and it has been getting worse. Back then you would get notified (be email) of any new issues opened in your own repos, those you were mentioned/participated in, or manually subscribed to -- everything was great. Fast forward to today, this behavior cannot be replicated.<p>You currently have two options:<p>- Enable email notifications for ALL watched things (basically your entire feed)<p>- Disable them entirely<p>In the first case, stuff that specifically pertains to you gets completely lost in the sea of notifications. In the second, you&#x27;re left to manually monitor new pull requests and issues in your own repos. In both cases, new issues/pulls go unnoticed for days or weeks.<p>The recent change on Oct 6 made things harder still. The reworked Issues panel defaults to `is:open is:issue author:<you> `(issues you opened yourself) rather than issues in your repos or opened by you: `is:open is:issue user:<you>`. There is no way to change this default filter, so now i have to bookmark the pre-filtered issue page to manually monitor new issues in my own repos. I have brought this up a couple times to Github staff and they apologize but do nothing about it.<p>Does everyone simply enable email notifs for their entire feed and use gmail filters to delete the 95% that don&#x27;t start with <you>/<repo>?<p>thanks!",1412785307

8427738,comment,8425501,8425501,0,0,VLM,,,"Brand problem and anonymity mismatch.<p>Plenty of people hate brands.  Microsoft, Ford, Chevy, Walmart, Green Bay Packers.  You try to turn yourself into a brand, you&#x27;re going to pick up hate because you&#x27;re a brand not because you&#x27;re a person and hating brands is culturally seen as a great idea that should be emulated as much as possible.  So trying to fix hatred toward humans is pretty much a waste of time when the root problem is hatred directed at brands.  Even if they are &quot;personal&quot; brands.  Or rephrased whatever is done to fix this (if anything) the blowback will eliminate brand hatred (umm, good luck with that BTW).  No more hating some random female programmer or journalist means no more hating walmart or ISIS or the Jews or Obama (oh wait Obama is a dude not a brand, well, he is both, whatever).<p>The other aspect is anonymity mismatch where semi-anonymous people are attacking very non-anonymous victims.  The solution proposed over and over is less anonymity for attackers.  Removal of identity from the victims would work just as well.  This merges in with &quot;personal brands&quot; paragraph above.  If supposedly you truly want to promote a message and not a brand, that brand being yourself of course, you&#x27;d do it for the cause and not the fame.  Unless you really are promoting yourself as a brand using a message as a tool to gain fame, and unfortunately gains attacks.<p>Combine the two concepts and a &quot;famous&quot; non-anonymous brand, which happens to be an individual, will get a heaping dose of trolling for deep seated cultural reasons related to what it means to be a brand and what it means to be famous (and not famous).  Good luck fixing that by getting distracted by &quot;brands are people too&quot; and &quot;be nice to people&quot;, its the wrong tactic to fix it.

Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I feel like it&#x27;s core to the idea of &quot;let&#x27;s go play a game&quot; that we largely agree on its rules -- and if more than half of us deny those rules, they are going to go off and play a different game; we won&#x27;t want to play with them. So one response is for the reference client to simply say &quot;if I see too many totally crazy things I&#x27;m just going to disconnect and ignore those peers who were saying that for a while.&quot;<p>But is it really a problem? You&#x27;ve got to imagine that we&#x27;ve got this red-vs-blue team game with two clients: ref and hax. The only way Red will be able to do this is if the red+hax population is greater than 50% among the server-population, because all of the ref clients will reject bad physics.<p>So suppose we&#x27;ve got a game of 21 people. 15 of them use the hax client (~70% participation), and we&#x27;ll just assume there are no low-latency peers for the moment. The red team gets 11 consistently; the blue team gets 10. Then assuming team assignments are totally random, there&#x27;s still only an 0.12% chance in any given game of the red team actually having 11 hax nodes and dominating the game. In the vast majority of the games they&#x27;ll have to play honestly. And that&#x27;s with 70% of the peers trying to game the system. (It gets a little worse if we include low-latency peers. So let&#x27;s assume that there are 4 and they get distributed unevenly, 1 on red, 3 on blue. The consensus threshold is now 9. Assuming we lost 3 hax clients in the process, 16% of such games will be vulnerable to your attack. That&#x27;s enough to make things frustrating.)<p>Meanwhile, the hax-client may make things unplayable unless it behaves like the ref-client when it&#x27;s not in the majority.<p>The basic point is that the red-vs-blue partition makes those attacks not a concern. But when that partition doesn&#x27;t exist, then there&#x27;s a bigger problem. So the more concerning thing for me is <i>denial of service</i>. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get 70% of the legitimate customers to try to hack the game, but I do think that IPv6 support could lead to one person having a block of 10,000 IP addresses being able to take the majority of peers in all of my games. Okay: they may not have enough red peers to win the games for red or enough blue peers to win the game for blue, but suppose that their goal isn&#x27;t to win, but just to shut down the system. Suppose their modified client, instead of saying &quot;everyone on blue suddenly dies&quot;, says simply &quot;everyone suddenly dies&quot;. Now 99% of games become unplayable, all of my legitimate users rage-quit, and I&#x27;m totally screwed.<p>So the problem is that sign-ups must be relatively closed and everyone needs to be able to validate that independently. I&#x27;m not sure how to solve that in a distributed way without some web-of-trust thing going on.",1412784181

Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far, except one: I simply cannot get good results plugging my laptop into projectors.  Either I can&#x27;t mirror screens at all, or if I can, I end up at a lowest-common-denominator resolution, usually less than 1024x768.  It could really become a dealbreaker for me, because I need to give a lot of presentations in places with their own projectors (e.g. classrooms).  Anybody know if there&#x27;s a Linux distribution that can do whatever magic Windows and Apple do when plugged into a projector?",1412784077

The first thing which comes to mind is that Docker does not use user namespaces. Hence, the root within Docker is the same root as on the host side. Of course Docker papers over the issue by using apparmor and other tricks but this does not cure the issue itself.<p>Linux containers (LXC, libvirt-lxc, Docker) are shared kernel visualization. Every single kernel vulnerability will hit you hard.<p>In contrast to LXC and libvirt-lxc Docker lets you configure a lot of insane setups which are not secure. (But easy to setup)
Also keep in mind resource issues. If you setup your container in a wrong way
it my eat all your available file descriptors, all memory, etc...
(Because it is shared kernel)<p>Let&#x27;s face it, the whole technology was not designed for sandboxing, more for
easy deployment of applications.<p>That said, I really love container and use them a lot in production with libvirt-lxc.
But I don&#x27;t use them for sandboxing.",1412784047

I made this because I wanted a simple way to plan-out this idea I had for Google Glass, but no knowledge of how Glass actually worked (best practices, display resolution, etc.)<p>Thinking others had the same problem I designed GlassWireframe much like any other mockup tool out there, yet specificly for modeling the look, feel, and interactive properties based on the official GDK.<p>I was very happy to see the hundreds who signed up to test the private beta; and I&#x27;m happy to announce it&#x27;s now open for public use.<p>GlassWireframe is still young and has much room for improvement. Here are a few things we&#x27;re working on to make it better based on user feedback:<p>- Collaboration: multiple accounts working on the same project<p>- Preview Mode: Viewing your Glass App creation set against uploaded scenic images, from the POV of a Glass User (much like starting a PowerPoint presentation)<p>Hope this helps!

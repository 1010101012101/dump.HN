For the strategic side of things, I enjoyed Janice Kim&#x27;s Learn To Play Go series, which has five or more volumes (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Play-Go-Masters-Ultimate/dp/1453632891/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1385351819&sr=1-1&keywords=janice+kim+learn+to+play+go\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Play-Go-Masters-Ultimate/dp/1453...</a>)<p>And, of course, with Go you have a nice progression from learning to play on the 9x9 board for tactics, the 13x13 board to begin learning strategy, and the 19x19 board to play the real game.  And thanks to the handicapping system, you can play much stronger players with both of you playing your hardest and both with a chance to win.",1385351980

6792378,comment,6791742,6791742,16,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"> &quot;One big mistake is to rely heavily on computers for chess analysis. Computer analysis should be done only after you analyze the game on your own.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t correct information anymore, in my opinion. Chess engines have improved tenfold over the last four years (when  the author says he stopped playing). The increase in the strength of chess engines has subsequently caused an increase in the &quot;humanity&quot; of chess engines, meaning that, instead of playing bizarre moves that are strong yet incomprehensible to humans, they play principled, sound moves that are strong tactically and strategically.<p>The main thing that you will miss as a sub-2000 player (or ever, really) is tactics, which is exactly where computers excel. A computer will be able to tell you tactics you missed and will allow you to experiment to see how different moves would have improved your game.<p>I agree that you should analyze games with your opponent after the game (and also with stronger players), but keep in mind that, if you&#x27;re both sub-2000, you&#x27;ll both miss obvious tactics even as you review the game, which doesn&#x27;t really improve your chess thought.<p>One last thing: the 400 points in 400 days training comes from the book <i>Rapid Chess Improvement</i>, which I <i>do not</i> recommend for the beginning player (the knight exercise is good, though). In it, Michael De La Maza wastes time blasting Jeremy Silman and the strategic approach to chess games. Some people like the book for the mild drama it started, but the tl;dr is &quot;tactics, tactics, tactics,&quot; which pretty much everyone will tell you.",1385351224

The systems you&#x27;re used to are fabulously expensive, sure, but their operating systems have sophisticated architectures that allow them to easily juggle multiple users running multiple programs while maintaining the security of the system overall. They are the completest expression ever realized of forty years of progress in the field of information technology.<p>Then, one day, someone drops a PC in your lap. You are <i>horrified.</i> It&#x27;s a single-user, single-tasking system with absolutely nothing stopping the user from trashing everything by running the wrong program.<p>To you, this new... <i>thing</i>, whatever it is, is barely worth the name &quot;computer.&quot; It feels more like a toy -- like something you would give to a child to play with. Certainly nobody would ever run <i>critical systems</i> on it, you think.<p>And here&#x27;s the thing. You&#x27;re absolutely right! All your concerns are one hundred percent valid. But it turns out that <i>nobody cares</i>; the PC is much, much cheaper, and it lets everyone have their own dedicated hardware right on their desk running any software they care to install, instead of time-sharing a mainframe and begging for permission each time they want to try a new program. Or, put more bluntly, it lets them escape from having to deal with the corporate IT priesthood (i.e. you) anymore.<p>The market speaks! You are derided as a pointy-headed nerd and swept into the dustbin of history.<p>Now fast forward ten or fifteen years. People start taking all those PCs they bought and hooking them together into networks... and suddenly all those things you were worried about back in the day come roaring back to bite them. Users discover that their machine stops talking to the network when they click and hold the mouse button, because the OS can&#x27;t walk and chew gum at the same time. And the complete lack of security makes their machines super easy to compromise.<p>The PC vendors panic. They scramble to rewrite their old systems into systems that can live comfortably on a network. And when they&#x27;re done, they roll out systems that look an awful lot like what you were insisting the baseline for a &quot;real computer&quot; was fifteen years ago. The world cheers and lines up to buy back all the sophistication they had happily thrown away before.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not so much that the IBMers were wrong, it&#x27;s that they were <i>early</i>. When OS/2 arrived, the world didn&#x27;t understand yet why it needed something like OS/2. And by the time it did, OS/2 didn&#x27;t exist anymore.

Mavericks, California. It&#x27;s a great little offshore town, just off Pillar Point. I love that town.<p>Kidding aside, this is a great article.<p>Related to this story, the Windows 3.0 visual shell was originally not supposed to be Program Manager and File Manager.  It was going to be a program called Ruby that I worked on with Alan Cooper and our team.<p>Ruby was a shell construction kit with a visual editor to lay out forms and components, which we called gizmos. You would drag arrows between gizmos to connect events fired by one gizmo to actions taken on another.<p>The shell was extensible, with an API for creating gizmos. A really weak area was the command language for the actions to be taken on an event. It was about on the level of batch files if that. But we hoped the API would allow for better command languages to be added along with more gizmos.<p>BTW, this project was where the phrase &quot;fire an event&quot; came from. I was looking for a name for process of one gizmo sending a message to another. I knew that SQL had triggers, but for some reason I didn&#x27;t like that name. I got frustrated one night and started firing rubber bands at my screen to help me think. It was a habit I had back then, probably more practical on a tough glass CRT than it is today.<p>After firing a few rubber bands, I knew what to call it.<p>(As one might guess, I&#x27;ve always been curious to know if the phrase &quot;fire an event&quot; was used before that. I wasn&#x27;t aware of it, but who knows.)<p>Anyway, Ruby didn&#x27;t become the Windows 3.0 shell after all. The went with ProgMan and FileMan instead. To give Ruby a better command language, they adapted Basic and the result was Visual Basic. Gizmos were renamed &quot;controls&quot; (sigh), and my Gizmo API became the notorious VBX interface (sorry about that).<p>And we still don&#x27;t have a programmable visual shell in Windows.",1385350256

Under some assumptions there are faster ways of marshalling in Python.  Secondly your granularity of access is the entire object.  You can&#x27;t just get a certain field out of a large object.  Thirdly because objects in the client cache are pickled you are spending a whole lot of time serializing/de-serializing them when you don&#x27;t really need to do that.

Basically BFT means a malicious node can&#x27;t do anything which will break the blockchain, because the only way any node can make changes to the blockchain is if it has solved a block (has the private keys to next block of bitcoins). Nodes with private keys to previous bitcoins have to get changes relayed through the node which solves the next block.<p>Likewise, Ripple achieves BFT by using its native currency (XRP) in a consensus scheme. The consensus scheme relies on Unique Node Lists (UNL), instead of proof-of-work. So nodes can only propose changes to the ripple ledger if they are on the UNL of some other node. And changes will only be accepted if they are signed by the private keys of the native currency (XRP). Nodes which aren&#x27;t on any UNLs have to broadcast their changes to nodes which are on a UNL, and of course, must still have the private keys to make those changes.<p>There are probably other ways to provide BFT, but using a native crypto-currency is one of them.",1385349141

You shoukd make the user choose or take him/her to the default language (there should be an obvious way to change the language from there anyway)<p>If you have multiple language, hopefully you already have a scheme to differentiate the language (i.e. wikipedia has the language in the URL). If the user went to a specific language URL you should ignore the other settings.<p>If he/she didn&#x27;t go directly to a specific language, it&#x27;s fair to assume he/she is in a non standard situation or is OK with the defaults, and applying heuristics doesn&#x27;t help.",1394963889

7408775,comment,7408055,7408055,0,0,robobro,,,"Hmmm. Here&#x27;s my 2 cents.<p>Every office has &quot;that person&quot; who causes/gets involved in drama, starts pointless arguments, or refuses to cooperate. Let&#x27;s assume, just for entertainment&#x27; sake, that she got bored of working there, and asked herself, what looks better on my resume? Worked at GitHub, got bored/wanted a higher salary/wanted to do less work, left... or worked at GitHub and got bullied out of the marketplace for being a woman in tech, but is an honest and good person nonetheless? This is one of the few fields left in tech where men outnumber / outperform women, and I hope that changes, both because I believe in gender equality, and issues like this will be better handled internally (and someone looking to improve her resume can&#x27;t pull this sort of act). And, well, after she makes these accusations, what are her former coworkers supposed to say? She&#x27;s kind of poisoned the well, so to speak.<p>Again, the way I see it, she&#x27;s either tired of working there and this is her way of finding new work, or there really was an office full of awful bigoted men who all hated her because she was interrupting their boy&#x27;s club. It&#x27;d actually work against her best interests if the latter were true. If she scared women away from working at GitHub and made them even more of a minority, then the few women remaining may be discriminated against further if gender discrimination&#x27;s really a big issue. The worst case about the former being true (rather than the latter) is that women who actually are unethical, assuming she isn&#x27;t, may find themselves able to play the gender card and find success in her same fashion. Either way, she getting big publicity for this is a &quot;win&quot; for her and a &quot;lose-lose&quot; for GitHub and the women who work there, unless they get a female-majority PR staff.<p>How are we supposed to respond to this sort of problem? How are we supposed to assess the validity of this woman&#x27;s claims? What are we supposed to do about it? This could serve as a good reminder to companies to have their HR&#x27;s doors open or something, but for all we know she could be lying out of her teeth. From a philosophical (logical/rational/skeptical) perspective, this article is just editorialized, meaningless garbage. It&#x27;s kind of sad, really... does anyone share my perspective? I&#x27;m just sharing because I hate bandwagons, I hate people jumping to blind conclusions, and I hate people burning witches (in this case, GitHub / anyone who defends GitHub, depending on the crowd). What I do know for certain is that GitHub provides a great service and I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I can be shown that GitHub systematically and indiscriminately works against its female employees&#x27; best interests in an objective manner, and that they choose to ignore the problem in the face of overwhelming evidence and social uproar.<p>As someone involved academically with philosophy, I am from a field also with notable under-representation / under-performance from women, for whatever reason. Maybe as a member of a &quot;boy&#x27;s club,&quot; I&#x27;m speaking out of ignorance or delusion. If I am speaking out of turn, I&#x27;d love to hear your rational response so I can correct it, and I&#x27;m sure anyone who holds a similar view would appreciate hearing what you have to say as well. (Shouting &quot;Victim blamer!&quot; or &quot;Misogynist!&quot; at me is not a rational response. It only makes you look like a fool. Personally, I&#x27;m most interested in seeing how enneff, who is definitely not a sockpuppet of the involved woman, replies.)",1394962252

At that time anime that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> based on a graphic novel (or novels) was practically impossible to get into wide distribution. Hence, no funding was available.<p>So they started by writing the story in a form of graphic novel and had it published first. After a moderate success in manga form it was easier to get the deals for making the anime too.<p>The bonus material went far enough to state that without the film there wouldn&#x27;t be Studio Ghibli. Personally I love the film. Even among the Ghibli productions it stands out as a great work of art.<p>And now I want to read the whole story.",1394960557

They were unabashedly staring at their female coworkers as &quot;eyecandy&quot; in that moment and even defended their doing so.<p>I have never understood how this argument works, obviously I&#x27;m missing something. Because I momentarily focus my attention on someone for their physical attributes, I automatically and necessarily consider them &quot;eyecandy&quot; rather than intelligent people with their own will that are to be respected? Does this work with other attributes -  if  I appreciate and acknowledge someone for X, does that mean that X is all they ever are to me? If the male employees had put on an impromptu bodybuilding pageant, would that have been the same thing?<p>Naturally, the fact that the woman in question was actually disturbed by the situation does indicate that there is cause for concern.",1394960515

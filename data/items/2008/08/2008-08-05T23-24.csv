It is a sensor you attach to your electric metre (its a camera which reads how fast it spins) with a wireless monitor. The main feature of the monitor is how many $/hour you are spending on electricity (you can have it in real time or averaged over any length of time). I enjoy walking through the house turning on various lights and appliances to see how much they cost to run.",1217980541

He excludes about 95% of businesses, which sell mundane goods like vacuum cleaners.<p>I guess guys like this are the answer to how you should go about selling vacuums, rags, and industrial pipe fittings?",1217980435

I'm sure they legitimately used 2005 data in doing so, but they probably tweaked their algorithms until the 2005 data was accurate given what we now know.

I transferred schools at that point, so I don't know if they continued, but given that one of the guys who used to beat me up was arrested for assault and battery with a caribeaner, I'd guess so.<p>My suburb's been gentrifying along with the rest of the Boston area, though.  When I was in school, there was still a sizable working-class population here, and I considered $400K to be a really expensive house.  Now you can't find housing here for less than half a million, and the house around the block just sold for $1.2M.  It's changed the character of the neighborhood a lot.",1217979035

I am thinking of some sort of ""Flashcard-Rank"" that rates the quality of the card sets by using metrics such as number of times studied, number of users who have saved the set, more than X number of cards and maybe a simple user rating system.<p>The ""featured card set"" on the home page was a start of the ""Featured Sets"" idea. That was ok when there were less sets to choose from. But, yes, it is time to expand it now. Good examples and how-tos can really help.<p>Thanks very much for sharing your thoughts.",1217978964
268008,comment,266396,266764,0,0,gregjor,,,"It may be gratifying to see your hunch written out but the author of the original article is just wrong about the history of relational databases. They were not just in the right place at the right time, or ""good enough,"" or driven by marketing hype as the article claims. You might want to read the well-documented history of relational theory, early RDBMS implementations and how they fit with what was already in use, and the ongoing evolution of RDBMSs and SQL.<p>Since the relational model predates OOP, to say nothing of flashes in the pan like Rails, it's backwards to say that the model is ""fundamentally flawed"" because it is mismatched to OOP. The mismatch isn't even real: OOP is a valid way to describe applications but it is not intended to describe databases. The relational model can enforce consistency and data integrity at the whole database level, which is a lot different than the object or single application level.<p>Programmers who developed large systems pre-Oracle have a very different view of the benefits of RDBMSs than programmers who first tried to use a database while developing a toy program with Rails. A little experience will teach you that for pretty much all real applications in the world the data is the only thing that has value; application code comes and goes. Any business that puts OOP purity before data integrity and consistency will not last. Would you feel better knowing that your bank uses Oracle, or that they use Rails and a half-baked ORM?<p>You might think ""no one cares about the relational stuff at all"" based on ORMS and Rails, but that is a peephole view of the world. The sooner you realize that Rails et al. are the Hollywood celebrities of the IT world the sooner you'll figure out how important those things really are.<p>I had more to say about this subject a while back in my article ""Why Programmers Donâ€™t Like Relational Databases"" at <a href=""http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=14</a>",1217978922

268006,comment,267935,267986,0,0,jleyank,,,"Given the current state of insourcing/outsourcing, why study science or engineering when both of these fields are vulnerable to job transfer to different parts of the globe?  Better to concentrate on those things which will survive such shifts: Law, Medicine, and seemingly mundane things like repair-of-stuff.  Business is popular right now, but after training our competitors, I think many of today's business people will see their jobs, if not their entire companies, attacked by foreign competition.  Medicine's not even safe, as anything that can be done w/o patient contact can be done in different time zones.<p>Besides, science/engineering is hard - requiring 6+ years for engineering and 8-10+ years for science to be able to work as a ""full member"" of the field.  Why take all that time when you can do 2-3 startups and retire rich?",1217978597

Ick.<p>This book will be sensationalist entertainment posing as non-fiction.

Buffett probably sees Jobs as a rival (perhaps not a direct one) and it is instinctive to highlight the flaws in your competitors.  Furthermore, I don't know if Buffett stands to gain or lose depending on Apple's share price but he is probably more concerned with the general principle of disclosure.  The use of ""material fact"" was probably used by Buffett to make it clear that there is an obligation (at least ethically and potentially legally) to disclose this sort of information (i.e. that Jobs was putting himself at a much greater risk (transplant) than implied and disclosed).",1245901140

673128,comment,672532,673047,0,0,thwarted,,,"Average users are not going to visit a blog to determine if they should use a service or not, or if they should use some random feature of a service or not.  FF's blog, or any company's blog, is not their main marketing channel, mainly because the blog is not the reason people know of the site/company or visit the site.  So while you're correct that 95% of the people have no idea how it is vastly different than email, the quality of the blog post as marketing material wouldn't serve to inform them anyway.  If FF is serious about ""marketing"" this, if a new feature of this simplicity (removing the restriction on post attachments from just allowing images) even requires marketing, this most definitely isn't, and I agree, shouldn't be it.<p>Fact is, FF provides structure to content streams that generic email and chat don't (gmail comes close to providing some structure, but it is still in the email paradigm).  It's one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one, real-time-based and archived, and encourages succinctness in a way that neither email nor chat can be.",1245901036

But to say that things will never reach the same level again or, ""I don't think we are in a recession, I think we have reset,"" he said. ""A recession implies recovery [to pre-recession levels] and for planning purposes I don't think we will. We have reset and won't rebound and re-grow""<p>It's folly. Of course we'll regrow. He's right about the no bounce part, but the growth will come slowly and surely. The correction gets rid of the fat companies that can't add much more value to the market.

673115,comment,672201,673057,0,0,patio11,,,"When some server on the Internet gives your browser a file, it includes a metadata called an expiry header (actually, Expires:), which the browser is supposed to interpret as providing guidelines for caching.  For example, if I tell you that this web page is good for until midnight tomorrow, and the user requests the same page later today, the browser can (but doesn't have to) serve the user the page out of the local cache, secure in the knowledge that I have told it I would not update the page until at least midnight tomorrow.  Since this totally skips the HTTP request for the page the second time, it results in blazing bugs-in-your-teeth speed.<p>Saying JQuery's expiry time is 1 year in the future means that Google is telling browsers who get the JQuery script ""Hey guys, you can rely on this being constant for a year, after that you'll probably want to ask for a new version.""  The poster above you apparently thinks this is suboptimal, because a user should be able to cache a particular version of JQuery for longer than one year.  I think that it is irrelevant, since in actual practice almost no user agent will reliably persist a cache for a year, and 1 extra HTTP request a year isn't enough to worry about, anyway.",1245900368
673114,comment,672823,672882,0,0,dasil003,,,"There's a big difference between terrorism security and both financial regulation and (especially) healthcare.  In the former, CYA is actually the only thing that can be done.  Of course no politician can ever say the truth, that when dealing with suicidal attackers there's really no way to even approach anything resembling comprehensive security--all our civil liberties and money would be spent well before we got there.  Sane measures like regular police, intelligence actions, and refraining from jabbing political hornets' nests are just not going to be seen as enough by coddled middle America who remain blissfully ignorant of conditions in the rest of the world.<p>With healthcare, on the other hand, the problems of uncovered individuals and waste in the system are measurable and ongoing.  Obviously there's no magical solution, but the problem can be attacked and the situation can be improved by a variety of metrics.<p>Financial regulation falls somewhere in between... even though those rich wall street cocksuckers totally screwed the rest of us and stole our money, it's not like they wanted this to happen.  The problem of systemic risk in the financial system is something that you can bet thousands of the best minds in the private sector will be working on, and it's considerably more tractable than the issue of how you prevent all terrorist attacks.",1245900153

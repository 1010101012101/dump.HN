The government strictly controls which land can be built on, and restricts supply so much that this is what is left.

5348056,comment,5347642,5348020,5,0,redact207,,,"That's sort of how it works here. The Singaporean housing market is divided into HDB (public housing) and Condo (private housing). Condo's nowadays start at around SGD 1m for something small and basic, but aren't such a bad deal with banks charging interest of just 1.8% on a 40 year loan. Most Singaporeans can't afford this with an average monthly wage of just SGD 2,000 per month.<p>Public housing on the other hand is heavily subsidised and somewhat controlled for PRs and citizens. FYI Singapore was a giant slum up until the government formed the HDB board in the 1960s. The CPF (Singapore's retirement fund) can be used as a deposit against your apartment which nowadays start at SGD 300,000 if you go far from the city. As you can guess, this results in many people having a lot of cash tied up in non-liquid assets when they retire that leads to a host of other issues.<p>I moved to Singapore 3 years ago from Australia and love the place and prefer life here to Hong Kong any day.",1362826484

To expand a bit on this, the heuristic Thomas follows is ""did the government simply do what a reasonable parent would do under the same circumstances?"". Thomas' argument in Brown was that adults would still be able to purchase some of the violent video games, as would children with explicit adult permission -- but absent parental involvement a government would act similarly to an average parent (prohibit purchase of certain video games).<p>He used similar logic in case of school censorship (if a parent would reasonable want to prohibit a student from wearing a shirt with an illicit message) or search and seizure (if a parent would reasonable want to search a students' person in one case, so may a school do so).<p>Personally, I disagree with this logic: the government is not the parent and in all of the above cases the parent could still exercise authority without the statute at hand (a parent can prohibit a child from playing video games, wearing a certain t-shirt, etc...).<p>Furthermore it's often insufficient nuanced: the standard is too vague (two children of same age may differ wildly maturity wise, some children may become ""emancipated minors"", etc...).<p>I personally believe there should be a ""gateway"" for youth to have greater civil rights (the right to vote, emancipate themselves, work under adult labour laws, serve in the military, etc...) -- but I haven't spent much time thinking how such a gateway would work.",1362824090

Likewise, that only left each cage dweller with 13 AUD per day from their welfare check for other expenses (which the narrator said was not enough to afford 3 meals every day after other expenses). So if the cost of living in a cage for a month is roughly the cost of 3 meals (though that must be calculated at the cost of eating out, because even in the US you can eat quite well on $13 a day if you are frugal and know how to cook and budget) then they are spending less than many U.S. homeless shelters charge (it's not uncommon for homeless shelters to charge anywhere from $5-12 per night here). It's by no means a comfortable lifestyle, but it's better than being homeless and I believe many Americans receiving welfare and/or disability actually have far less buying power with what they receive, considering it's usually not nearly enough to meet rent, utilities, and food and transportation costs).",1362823938

It is already legislated in a number of countries; and if a local business puts in an opt-out checkbox instead of opt-in ? Blam; this contact info is considered obtained without consent, please delete it and here is the invoice for your fine, thank you very much.<p>Another pattern that can be eliminated is hidden costs - i.e., in EU, you have to advertise the full cost, including the tax and ""mandatory convenience fees""; so for some costs you can't hide them away.<p>And of course, the most effective tool is legally mandated rights for returns and cancellations - it gives actual teeth to angry customers, since if you succeed in tricking them, they can just cancel the deal [not neccessarily through a process that the company prescribes] and get full returns.",1362823433

So if Blizzard decides to pull the plug, you have no choice but to reimplement the whole server-side. Fortunately, Blizzard seems much more serious about the follow-up of their games than EA ever was (consider that Warcraft 3 patches are still being put out).<p>Still, even Blizzard could not avoid server problems at launch.",1362823417

The only difference was that we are using MySQL and _django-mysqlpool_.<p>If almost all solution are using SQLAlchemy components and SQLAlchemy is NOT DBMS-specific, it should be possible to create one package that works for SQLite3, MySQL and Postgres at the same time.

Basically, it's a github-like platform for Excel workbooks, i.e. people can put their spreadsheets under version control (via simple drag & drop) and get proper diffs on value, formulae, formatting and VBA changes (merging is on the agenda). I know Excel isn't particularly hipster but it's still very, very widely used in companies, something that won't go away quickly. And from my own experience the lack of an appropriate, user-friendly version control system is something that contributes a lot to the Excel mess. So I thought rather than fighting Excel, I'll build something useful around it. Any feedback much appreciates. thanks, Bjoern",1369216765

As the Wikipedia article rightfully points, the difference is far less obvious than you make it seem.<p>The definition of an interpreter is generally broader than a main loop running instructions one at a time. For example, everyone seem to agree that Python is an interpreted language while python interpreter transforms the source code into an IR before passing that to its main loop. Truth is the line between what is a VM, an interpreter and a compiler is rather fuzzy.<p>The implementation of a process virtual machine clearly is an interpreter of a bitcode. Now, it's not entirely absurde to consider the couple JIT and VM taken together as an interpreter. Actually, this is clearly encompassed by the third point of the definition of an interpreter provided by  Wikipedia : ""explicitly execute stored precompiled code[1] made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system"".<p>To come back to the article discussion, I agree with the previous poster than the expression ""source code VM"" is kind of meaningless. Actually, the paragraph following is even plain wrong. The Dart VM executes bitcode not source file and Dart is JITed.<p>In the same way, I find it quite surprising that forty years after Hindley paper, people still confuse type annotated and statically typed but well, c'est la vie.",1369214948

The minimum volume at which they can be produced, legalized may be too high though for any kind of niche luxury market though.<p>The path to substantially replacing human driven cars though is (I think) some sort of driverless taxis. The price where driverless taxis take over is probably somewhere around where the cost per km of driverless is lower. That could be pretty high. Assuming other operational costs are similar to regular taxis $150k-$200k for a driverless vehicle that lasts 3-5 years sounds viable.<p>Driverless cars have been sitting around the edge of our consciousness as ""experimental but interesting"" for a long time. But, the economic changes they introduce are potentially enormous, wide. I think there's a good chance that privately owned cars become rare, for example. General purpose cars may go away. A golf cart is just fine for going 5-10 miles in urban traffic.<p>This space is big enough for Google/Ford/IBM sized giants to emerge in. Makers of the cars, makers of the driver, makers of the UI, operators of the taxi companies, who knows what else. Maybe makers of digital roadsigns.

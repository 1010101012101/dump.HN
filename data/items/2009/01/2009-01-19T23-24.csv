The truth of this is not to be underestimated. It varies from company to company (and number to number within a company), but very often the call center employees are given rigid, obsolete support systems, scripts, and no latitude to do anything to help. In fact, it's also common for the care reps to not be employed by the company you're intending to call for support, rather a telemarketing firm that specializes in grinding out phone calls. I worked for one agency, representing three or four big name companies (names anyone in tech would recognize) and I don't think I ever met an employee of the companies we were representing.<p>I also don't get too wound up about international support for this reason. If these companies wouldn't give any power to people three states away with no language barrier (upstream or downstream) there's no reason whatsoever to expect that a company has given someone in another hemisphere the ability to flex in any way at all.",1232407951

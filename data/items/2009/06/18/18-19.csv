She has known and used google for years as have most of her friends.<p>And a child of 7 being concerned about a start-up making money? why would a child ask that? They are either (as I said) copying the oft spoken words of a parent or they are burdened with things that a child of 7 should not be.<p>""scheming about money"" seems a little unusual. Mine likes to play shop, but she's much more interested in the natural world and leaves money to the grown ups.<p>My child also likes to go play outside, but she also likes to look things up that she has seen or found or heard about, just like me. I don't limit that, I encourage that. Being voraciously curious and knowing how to use a tool that can satisfy that is I think a true gift of living in the modern world and I very much want my child to be part of the modern world.<p>I'm sure you meant well mediaman, but if you are ever around kids you'll realize that every 7 year old knows about google.",1245351363

Western ones certainly are, as evidenced by Dr. Weston Price, Vilhjalmur Stefansson &c. In my own experience, daily arizona green teas and mochas add up, and are loaded with sugar. So is food at every restaurant, from Denny's to the poshest, including steak.<p>>So, is your recommendation an isocaloric diet, a ketogenic diet, or eating only when you actually feel hungry, and only enough to assuage the hunger?<p>Others are better qualified to make recommendations:  Dr. Eades and Stephan at wholehealthsource.<p>My protocol: no omega-6, eat 1/day within 5 hour period, eat if hungry, eat till full, overeat if I feel like it [0]. No wheat at all[1], limit sugar to once/wk.<p>I est. 1.5-2.5 kcal/meal, but because of tabata/kettle-bells etc. my calorie needs are quite a bit higher, so I'll punt and call it iso-caloric.<p>It <i>is</i> ketogenic, only because I prefer to eat coppa, proscuitto, butter, cream, yogurt, eggs and cheese, rather than spend time to bake sourdough, soak oats etc. Sugar (honey) and carbs (mostly sauerkraut) 1/wk.<p>I started intermittent fasting based on an article by Dr. Eades, and stuck with it only because it was really easy to do, and lets me program pretty much from 7am to 8pm (a single meal saves time as well as assoc. post-prandial sleepiness). Also Frederick Burnham-Russell[2] is a big hero of mine, and he IF-ed his way through awesomeness.<p>Other than the above, I don't consider it a diet in the ""dieter"" sense at all, although it is very Banting[3].<p>[0] cannot overeat butter! olive oil is allowed, and severely limited EFAs (omega 3-6-9) due to <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400040780"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=978140...</a><p>[1] imho, all wheat-eaters have non-symptomatic celiac disease, and budding diabetes.

The Art of Learning - I'll never think about practice the same way.<p>2. Getting Things Done - Enough has been said about this elsewhere, but the whole concept of ""what's the next action"" has really worked for me.<p>3. E-Myth Revisited - This was my MBA in one book. It came at the right time for me and really changed the way I think about creating businesses as assets. I wasn't a fan the cheesy example of the pie shop, but the advice has been invaluable.<p>Others that I found interesting, and that changed the way I think were:<p>4-hour Work Week. Yes, there is a ton of hype around this book, but I'd be surprised if anyone read it with an open mind and didn't learn anything or come away motivated to experiment with their lifestyle.<p>Outliers. This one probably stands out to me since I read it so recently. Gladwell gets a lot of hype as well, but I think he deserves at least some of it.<p>The Culture Code drastically changed the way I think about marketing.<p>And, a few random notes on the others I've read:<p>I found Predictably Irrational, Brain Rules and The 48 Laws of Power to be mostly garbage.<p>The Wisdom of Crowds, Wikinomics and Made to Stick are decent essays in book form.<p>Stumbling on Happiness is not nearly as good as Haidt's The Happiness Hypothesis which would be in the first list I made above if it were on Siver's list.<p>Seth Godin's books are good for motivation and for changing the way you think about marketing, especially if you've been doing it for a long time (I haven't).

663843,comment,663432,663823,0,0,sanj,,,"Without detracting from mediaman's politeness post, this is an interesting topic.<p>First off, I rabidly limit the ""screen time"" my kid gets.  That's the sum of TV, computer and (nowadays) my iPhone.  I'd much rather have him wandering the great outdoors.  When he uses the computer, he's got a set of sites that he likes and tends to stick to them.  We'll collaboratively use Google to find answers to stuff, but he won't typically do it on his own.  He recognizes that as parent-kid activity.  I think this is a positive thing.<p>The ""google"" is actually about three years old, when I was considering interviewing there and all roads led there.  I suspect (and I hope the Googler's appreciate this!) that part of the question was based on how funny of a word it is.  Especially drawn out: Goooooooooooooooooogle.  Now he knows multiple people there, including his Godfather.<p>But the money comment is all part of who he is.  He loves money: counting it, trading it, scheming about it.  He's not <i>worried</i> about money, but he is <i>fascinated</i> by it.  He spent more time coming up with the pricing scheme for his lemonade stand than actually operating it.  Think Alex P. Keaton.<p>Then again, he's also fascinated by dinosaurs and how we'd repel their attacks, so I'm not too concerned.<p>And he knows that I work for myself and that people normally get paid by bosses.  So the leap of how does LuckyCal make money struck me as very natural.  While I can imagine us having had such a discussion in front of him, I don't think we have.  Instead, when he discusses it at all, he's always been very focussed on the application's social elements.<p>In any case, while I appreciate mediaman sticking up for my kid, I tend not to worry about it too much.  I wondered aloud to my mom recently that I thought he was smarter than I was.  I expected her to rush to my defense.  Instead, she agreed with me.<p>And I'm pretty damn smart.",1245349193

Then you would have to proceed to explain how they might get access to that data.<p>But that's not the whole of it. Once they can read the 0's and 1's, you need to tell them how to interpret them. So you need to provide (at least) an ASCII table in some extremely durable material.<p>The rest of the information (on how to interpret the data) can then be stored in the first mega/gigabytes of the binary data. Plain text ASCII only, ofcourse. No pictures, audio, or video. You could only include such data once you've told them how to build a computer and all necessary software.<p>I think you're better off storing a computer and a self-sufficient powersource in a vacuum, virtually indestructible structure.

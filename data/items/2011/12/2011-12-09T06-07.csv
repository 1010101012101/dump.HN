3332903,comment,3332357,3332673,6,0,fpgeek,,,"I think both Google and Apple made the right design choices at the start. They just made different ones is because they had different business goals.<p>Google wanted Android to be ubiquitous and free to quickly evolve into whatever it needed to be to be in order to capture territory in the mobile device world. That means supporting a wide range of devices, technologies and, most importantly, partners (both hardware, software, carriers, etc.). So Android was designed for flexibility and has extension points everywhere (input frameworks, sharing, alternative browsers, launchers and so on). Google gave up performance along many dimensions in order to maximize Android's adaptability.<p>Apple is very different. They have a vision and want to build that vision as precisely as they can because that is what has driven their success. That means Apple doesn't want hardware partners. And even at the software level, thsat means they are very careful about who and what they allow into their user experience.<p>You can see this in how they built new features for iOS 5: Apple added a split keyboard for the iPad rather than adding support for alternative keyboards. They bought Siri rather than exposing relevant extension points. Apple baked Twitter into iOS 5 as a one-off, rather than riffing off of Android's sharing (as they did with notifications). And so on. These are all business decisions, not technical ones (as Cydia often proves). Instead, iOS's technical architecture flows from Apple's goals in the same way Android's flows from Google's.",1323413658

Now it's big supply with a terrible signal to noise ratio.<p>To succeed, it seems that you now either need a mountain of luck, or a killer marketing engine and a fair amount of luck. Mathematically, it seems unattractive compared to other ways of applying the same time and skills unless you have something you're obsessed with building and want to produce irrespective of the outcome probabilities.<p>E.g. a $1.99 app pays at $1.393, so you need to move 34893.75 paid copies in order to clear a $50,000 gross. For SaaS and the same target, you only need 208.33 customers at $20/mo. The capture difficulty is not identical between cases - but if you have good marketing and are assuming serendipity on either side, it's quite feasible to hit 208 customers. Furthermore, it's often easier to grow once you get there, and it's quite possible to charge at much more than $20/mo/customer.<p>Mobile apps are great, but not a ""for profit"" activity for me. I'm all for doing them for fun or ad hoc, and if that takes off - great. But it seems to be a very difficult business model compared to applying similar resources elsewhere.",1323413546

The goal is to get to a point where we can engineer intrusive, large government structures out of the picture.  For example, if we were to have state and local governments running the last mile telephone network but allowing services to  be provided by a host of competing businesses, we'd have a freer market with less regulation.

The documentation is blissfully short and effective.  When I had technical questions, a post to their email list got me a detailed response within hours (and usually within minutes).  Honestly it's the best developer support experience I have ever had with any product in my 16 years of professional software development.  I hope it lasts.<p>All three of PayPal, Google, and Amazon suck, but I will honestly say that PayPal is probably the worst developer experience I've had in that same time period.  And this was for a <i>very</i> simple implementation of a single product one-time purchase.<p>1) It took hours to figure out what product I wanted.  PayPal's product assortment is a trainwreck.  What the hell is the difference between Web Payments and Web Payments Pro and Adaptive Payments and about a dozen other things with idiotic names that all sound the same.  The chart that tries to help you pick a product is useless.<p>2) The layout of paypal's website is labyrinthine.  Even after I figured out what product I needed, assembling all the relevant documentation was hard.<p>3) The documentation is flat-out wrong in several (rather important) places.  For example, the IPN guide (naturally, a PDF <a href=""https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/IPNGuide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/...</a>) on page 9 clearly states that you must explicitly post back messages to paypal to get them to stop sending (which is retarded and screws up transactions), but HN says that this is not the case.  You can see my venting about this almost a year ago here:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2341119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2341119</a><p>4) Posting a technical question to PayPal's forum gave me an unhelpful response from a clearly first-level ""read the flowchart"" technical support rep.  Pointless exercise.<p>5) PayPal's APIs all feel like they were designed in the 1990s.  Seriously, I would be horribly embarrassed to publish an API like that.  I put more thought into (and produce better documentation for) my opensource projects.  Useless crap websites like Foursquare can come up with solid APIs, there's no excuse for a company that handles actual <i>money</i> to be this janky.<p>It's vogue to hate PayPal because they really horribly suck.  And now there are good alternatives.  So I say, let them rot.  WePay costs a little bit more but it is worth it not to have bit scary parts of my codebase that I dread going into.",1323412838

There are less obvious things like the fact that <i>huge</i> side effects often pop up.<p>How much time will you spend on artwork?  Every version of Mac OS X looks different, so your custom widget may have 4 different looks and you just know you'll need a 5th next year.  Maybe it's a cross-platform program.  Maybe the entire thing needs to change depending on where in the world it will be used.  And this doesn't even begin to look into issues with programming images (e.g. tracking the mouse inside odd shapes or figuring out how to render things at different window sizes).<p>Setting UI behavior is also deceptively simple.  It can take a very long time to be sure that you've thought of everything even if you're reproducing a variation of UI that's pretty standard already.  You often interact with existing things, e.g. a window manager or mouse event system, and you can be seriously screwed if you find a deficiency in a dependency.<p>What about when your entire framework breaks because you need a customization?  (This seems to happen in Cocoa all the time.)  For example, guess what: customizable toolbars and resize-from-any-edge come ""for free"" in standard windows but they are <i>completely</i> unavailable for custom windows.  Some changes can look simple on paper and explode when you actually try to implement them.  Nothing ruins a weekend like discovering that a simple change would break all kinds of tangentially-related UI elements that were already working.

If you need to do uploads or add a plugin, you can do it over SSH.  Allowing someone to execute arbitrary code from your website is just asking for pain.<p>2) Many (but not all!) exploits start in wp-admin.  I make mine inaccessible over the public Internet, enforced ny Nginx before any PHP gets the chance to execute.  (Options: only accessible over VPN, only accessible through proxy you control, only accessible with a client certificate, etc.)<p>3) Routine DB/code backups.  I'd keep wp-content in a git repo.  Add a plugin?  Have to add it through repo.  Code changes other than through git?  Smack yourself for setting permissions wrong, then roll back to a known good version from the repo.  Weird links on blog pages?  Roll back DB to known good version.<p>4) Should go without saying, but every blog gets it's own user and own DB, and that user only gets sufficient privileges to manipulate the blog DB.<p>5) Write a shell script to do an automatic ""upgrade all blogs to latest version of WP"" since you'll be doing this a lot.

However, one often can make a good guess about the future based on knowing who is widely imitated. Widely imitated people are influencers, and whatever they like will often be liked a few years from now. All great designers have a mental list of such influencers and they likely will never share it with you because that list is literally the source of their success.<p>Also, if you are really great designer, you can directly make future happen without having to imitate others. I had a chat with one former roommate of mine who was going to a wedding when he asked me about my opinion on his shoes. The shoes were way too clubby (i.e. completely inappropriate for a wedding) and I was frankly horrified, telling him that I would never in a million years be seen at a wedding wearing that type of shoes. Next day, he shows me a very fell-fitted suit looking completely dapper yet still wearing those completely inappropriate shoes because he could not get a pair of shoes that fit on time (Saturday was right around the corner). Seeing his new outfit, I changed my opinion on the shoes and asked my roommate this question: ""Do you know what happens when one item you are wearing is wrong and out-of-place but everything else about your outfit is completely and utterly awesome?"" He responded, ""Hmmm, no one notices?"" I said, ""No, you're wrong. That one out-of-place item becomes the new trend.""",1323411279

The latency of someone walking from the head of the single queue to the cashier each time matters, especially if the person at the front isn't alert or is confused by trying to figure out which till to go to. People are smart enough to pick short queues to join and there is no latency. Also psychology, nobody wants to join a long queue even if it moves fast, they go to another store.",1323410848

I think that says more about the deficiencies of Windows than the deficiencies of the shell scripting/pipeline model.<p>This is slightly besides the point anyways. Even though most of Git has been rewritten in C, Git is still comprised of lots of little single-purpose commands, which I have used in pipelines to do some ""outside the box"" processing on Git repositories.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29#Portability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29#Portability</a>",1323410810

So are yours. That sucks. But I also don’t feel particularly guilty about it, and neither should you. It’s something you’ve inherited, living in this world. The onus now on you isn’t to wallow in guilt — it’s to be aware of these deep-buried attitudes, and consciously try to avoid letting them dictate your choices in life.</i><p>All of us draw racist conclusions from time to time. I've done it more than once, and doubtlessly will do so again.

If someone says ""people who speak English tend to succeed"", that is not overtly racist. When someone says ""people who win math competitions succeed"", or ""people with a family history of entrepreneurship succeed"", or ""people who can afford to pay an immigration tax succeed"", these statements are not overtly racist.

If I was to figure out an elegant way of doing this in JS, I can piggyback on the buzz of DI and IoC to help people think deeper about programming.<p>Couple that with the frustration of ""people don't get it unless you show them code"", and I've been spending more and more nights coding away again. So my recommendation would be:<p>1) Get excited about something<p>2) Realize that you're very fortunate to have the resources to be excited about something 99% of the world does not<p>3) Socially commit by telling people about it (even if they don't get it)",1237238495

Based on the feedback we got from our first users we went back to stealth mode and we've given the interface a major overhaul. It's become a one-page-design where all your time-tracking, planning and scheduling happens on a single page. We've noticed that almost all existing time-tracking software either has a terrible interface or doesn't even match the features of pen-and-paper time-trackers. We think our interface turned out pretty well, and it might suit your taste too.<p>We just entered private beta, so, if you have a few minutes, try it out (key for HN users: NOPROCRAST). Needless to say, we want to know what you think. Don't hold back :)<p>www.thymer.com",1237238326

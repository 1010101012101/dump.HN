5149896,comment,5146870,5149700,2,0,cmccabe,,,"The problem in Oakland is gang activity.  So your chances of getting randomly killed there are a lot less than the numbers might suggest.  However, it does happen that people get caught in the crossfire.  Oakland also covers a pretty wide area and there are some better and worse parts.<p>I have never been to Stockton, but you are right that the  crime rate there seems surprisingly high.  The cops blame it on the drug cartels.  The city is fairly poor (median income 35k) and filed for bankruptcy last year.  I'm not sure what the problems are there, but I'm fairly sure bored kids are not near the top of the list.<p>Incidentally, there is something distasteful about criticizing a city you've never even visited.  Especially when you live in a much whiter and richer area.  I grew up in a poor area that I'm sure many here would have looked down on.  You can have pride in where you live without tearing other people down.",1359709145

There is no way for the scientific community to look for flaws in methodology. Flaws in research methodologies are often found, sometimes years later, so it's to be expected that at least some placebos are making studies inaccurate perhaps dangerously so, and it's also to be expected that we will never know which studies are compromised since the data is not published publicly.<p>Yes, placebo design is extremely complicated and often involves active ingredients intended to simulate side effects and treatment experience without treatment effects.<p>There is quite a bit written in the comments here.<p>For instance, it would be quite easy for a company to fake efficacy accidentally or intentionally by using a placebo that inhibited natural healing or even made the treated condition worse.

If you require a complete stack trace to be able to debug a listener to the event, that sounds like you have a bigger architectural problem to deal with.<p>Events are coarse. The listener should not care about why the event was fired, only that the event has occurred. Events are not a replacement for direct function calls. They are a mechanism for de-coupling pieces of code that can be independent of each other. It doesn't sound like your situation is one where there's that independence.",1359708336

A simple recursive descent parser is very easy to write, and more importantly is very easy for someone else to understand. It does not require any esoteric knowledge of lookup tables and ""advanced"" parsing algorithms. I far prefer a stack trace from inside someone's hand-written recursive descent parser to the cryptic mess you get from\nYacc or Antlr generated code. I also prefer not having to have a whole code generation stage in my build process just to support some small DSL I have embedded.<p>This whole ""you should never write your own parser"" thing is so often parroted out as ""wisdom""...

It's vastly easier to just play the triad on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings with the first 3 fingers; forget the bar.  And if it sounds weak, turn up the volume or strum harder. :)",1339541971
4103398,comment,4102589,4103297,26,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is a great question, I wish I could reasonably answer it. I'm a big fan of rail, and while San Jose was celebrating their first 4 miles of light rail (in just 10 years from the start of the project!) I was looking that the marker in the Sacramento Rail museum (recommended) commemorating the laying of 10 miles of the Union Pacific rail line in <i>one day</i>.<p>Part of it is that some folks really hate rail, so much so that they will continually sue anyone who is working to build it. They will argue wildlife endangerment, habitat destruction, cancer risk, suicide risk, traffic risk, earthquake/disaster risk, global epidemic risk, job preservation/creation/destruction risk, you name it. Anything to get back in court and have a judge temporarily suspend work. Because you hire someone to work on a project, and they can't because of some court order, you still have to pay them. So what happens is these projects have 'burn rates' (which is the cost of renting equipment (or depreciating it if you own it) and labor and materials (some of which degrade over time if not used)) and then you have 'able to work' days. Actual work days might be 90 for a mile of track, but time actually passed is like a year. So the other 275 days people sat on their hands while expensive lawyers argued to get work restarted.<p>Its one of the things I bring up at town hall meetings with politicians. The tax payer, and the 'NIMBY' [1] folks, fight a very asymmetric kind of warfare. No court challenges until funds are committed, and then six. You need look no further than the maneuvering around the California High Speed Rail project to see it play out in all of its ugliness.<p>[1] NIMBY -acronym Not In My Back Yard for people who are opposed to any new infrastructure near where they live.",1339541962

4103391,comment,4102248,4102248,15,0,gojomo,,,"The bat-ball and lily-pad questions are 2 of the 3 questions on a short test called the 'Cognitive Reflection Test' (or 'CRT') meant to measure whether people make the effort to think beyond the obvious (but wrong) answer.<p>By using those examples, after its headline,  this article seems to imply smarter people do worse on these CRT questions. But that is <i>not</i> what I've read elsewhere -- which is that the CRT is positively correlated with other quantitative measures of intelligence (including IQ scores, SATs, and high-school/collegiate grades). 'Smart' people (by those measures) do tend to do better on the CRT.<p>And if you read this article carefully, you see that while it uses these two CRT questions as examples of tricky questions, when it discusses the results about awareness-of-bias not helping alleviate bias, it isn't necessarily saying smart people do worse on those two CRT questions. It's a bit muddled in what it's saying, and reviewing the linked abstract doesn't help much either. The paper is evaluating some very specific things under the umbrella term 'cognitive sophistication', which might not map to what we usually call 'smart' or even 'test-smart'.<p>BTW, I personally think the CRT may be especially useful for evaluating software/systems proficiency. The bat-ball question probes understanding of algebra; the lily-pad question probes understanding of geometric growth (and someone accustomed to powers-of-2 will find it easier); the third question probes understanding of parallelism and projected-rates-of-work.<p>That third question happens to be:<p>""If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?""<p>(A software person might also think of it as: ""If it takes 5 cores to compress 5 GB in 5 minutes, how long would it take 100 cores to compress 100 GB?"")",1339541820

Why? Well, your big problem is always going to be leaks. In an air-filled tunnel you can get away with microscopic cracks, no problem; you've got a small direct interface between water and air, and the surface tension of the water is enough to keep the water in place. It's very hard to force water through a really tiny crack. In a vacuum, however, surface tension goes away -- liquid water at an interface with vacuum will <i>boil</i>, and all of a sudden you've got water vapour filling your nice evacuated tube through every microscopic crack in its five thousand mile length.

Ever tried riffing off a humming appliance? It's really fun. I used to do it while waiting for my laundry, since the washers all hummed at the same pitch. When it's you and a fixed tone, your harmonic palette starts opening up in wild ways. Microtones creep in, and new decoration schemes.<p>You also have to be careful because Bach and Purcell didn't think in terms of our modern harmonic structure. They worked in voicing and figured base, which produces similar, but not identical, results. Go back a little farther, and it's all voicing. Palestrina in in some ways closer to Schoenberg than Haydn.<p>As for the breakdown of harmony in art music, not so much. Serialism got all the academic and theoretical attention, and many mediocre composers with a theoretical bent worked in it, and a few great composers like Stravinsky and Shostakovitch, but it's hardly all the art music that was being composed. Many composers got through their whole careers without any particular use of it, such as Walter Piston. What that has to do with rock and roll is a mystery to me, since it's an offshoot of jazz, which is alive and well and still serving as a wellspring for new music.",1339540661

This hyperparameter optimization is ""embarrassingly parallel"", to use a term of art. So if you have multiple machines, each one uses a different hyperparameter and no Hadoop is necessary. I wouldn't be surprised if this approach is over twenty years old. Choosing the hyperparameter over ALL the data and training a linear model of ALL the data should be superior training an ensemble of models over subsets of data, and picking hyperparameters over subsets.<p>On interesting area of research is when there are many hyperparameters, particularly for non-linear models. For example, in training a deep neural network, there are many hyperparameters, and it becomes prohibitive to do exhaustive hyperparameter selection. Randomization is one good strategy. James Bergstra has done some recent work on improving hyperparameter selection. If you used a <i>smart</i> technique to guide the search within the hyperparameter space, and had one ""master"" node that gave hyperparameters to the worker nodes, and this master node did the hyperparameter search, that would be a sophisticated and useful technique.<p>[edit: spelling]",1339540615

4103225,comment,4101992,4103066,13,0,planetguy,,,"Yes and no. It was easy for Bach and Beethoven to be innovative, less had been <i>done</i> back then. The story of classical music from 1800 to 1952, though, is a story of composers forever looking for new ways to innovate. First they did away with all the old rules of structure, and we didn't miss them too much. There's some great music from this period.<p>Then, they started doing away with all the rules of harmony. The prelude of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde has a dissonant chord which resolves to another dissonant chord, and it <i>totally blew everybody's mind</i>. By 1913 you've got <i>The Rite Of Spring</i> which avoids almost all traditional harmonies, and it's causing riots in Paris but a few years later that kind of thing is old hat. In the 1920s you've got Schoenberg going ""Y'know what? Screw tonality. Let's just play all the notes one by one; at this point you've got music which <i>very, very few</i> people out there can actually enjoy. I mean, I have a CD of Schoenberg's violin concerto, and even the blurb on the back of the CD doesn't seem to like it very much.<p>Then you've got a few decades of increasingly obscure music until my chosen endpoint of 1952, which is the year when Johnny Cage wins a flawless victory in the ""look how unmusical I can make my music"" championship by publishing 4'33"", the piece consisting entirely of silence. This was the signal that the old musical tradition had finally disappeared up its own butthole. (1952 is also the year when Rock Around The Clock was first written.)<p>Anyway, John Williams is basically an acknowledgement that if you're going to make big orchestral music which people <i>actually like</i>, then all the good ideas were taken by 150 years ago, and any additional innovation away from that point pretty much just makes it worse [or, at least, less enjoyable by the majority of people].",1339539377

This is commendable, because these details are important in applied work.<p>The authors devise a method for large-scale <i>supervised</i> classification. Essentially, the data is partitioned between nodes, and each node trains a l2-regularized logistic model on its data using SGD. The individual models are then aggregated into an ensemble. This approach is obvious but non-standard (I'll describe why later).<p>I believe this methodology is of limited applicability. The experiments are supervised training of sentiment analysis on 100M tweets. But it is simple and fast to do supervised learning over 1B instances <i>on a single box</i>. And there are <i>very few</i> tasks that have >>1B <i>labeled</i> training examples.<p>In most ""large-scale"" real-world tasks, there are 10-1M labeled training examples, and 100M to jillions <i>unlabelled</i> training examples. So what we really care about is unsupervised learning (over unlabelled examples) followed by supervised learning (over labelled examples) or semi-supervised learning (over unlabelled and labelled examples). <i>Distributed</i> unsupervised learning is challenging. It is an active research area with only a few results, and a lot of untapped potential.<p>One claim in the paper is surprising: ""As is often the case for many machine learning problems, and confirmed in our experiments (see Section 6), an ensemble of classifiers trained on partitions of a large dataset outperforms a single classifier trained on the entire dataset (more precisely, lowers the variance component in error)."" First of all, I'm surprised by the claim ""an ensemble of classifiers trained on partitions of a large dataset outperforms a single classifier trained on the entire dataset"". It is true that an ensemble (forest) of decision trees is better than a single decision tree. This is like adding another layer in a neural network, and allows more powerful models to be expressed more compactly. But, crucially, <i>an ensemble of linear models is just a linear model</i>. So in fact, there should be no variance reduction in the authors' approach. It should be better to train a single linear model on ALL the data, rather than an ensemble of linear models on subsets of the data. I am surprised that the ensemble of linear models outperforms the single model. Further investigation is needed to understand why. My gut feeling is that there is a problem in his experiment.<p><i>tl;dr</i> The machine learning models will have limited impact, because they are purely supervised. But check out the technical details and infrastructure portion of the paper.",1339539286

Some of Clay Bennett's e-mails got leaked, and they make it clear that while he was publicly promising to try to keep the team in Seattle (which was a condition of the original sale) he was privately saying he'd move the team to OKC ASAP.  As long as Clay Bennett is involved with the Thunder, the majority of Sonics fans are going to be against them.<p>Also remember that of current Thunder players, only Nick Collison was on the team before Clay Bennett arrived.  Kevin Durant played one year in Seattle but it was already common knowledge that the team was going to leave, so fans didn't really take to him much.  All of the other rotation players were added after the move.  So there aren't any beloved players left on the team to mitigate the anger coming out of Seattle.<p>It's similar to LeBron being thought of as a villain.  It's not <i>that</i> he left Cleveland, it's <i>how</i> he left Cleveland.

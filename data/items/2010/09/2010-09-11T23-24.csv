Sure, it's not optimal, in the sense that winning hand dominance is varied, but it provides an entire hand to play with absolutely no risk.  You're guaranteed to win, on average, the average pot size.  That is a massive advantage.<p>More importantly, I think the sort of ""deck hacking"" mindset the author has created can open up a world of research into this topic.  Producing decks with some sort of ""mean winning hand dominance"" that is low would be the step you are describing.<p>As for practicality, that's another world of research.  Would it be possible to create a deck such that when shuffled a specific and non-conspicuous way produces a high likelihood of a Joffe deck?  Off the top of my head, one could take the decks provided and produce decks that when riffle shuffled twice, produce a Joffe deck.  So, for example, you could take out a ""fresh deck"" (which is rigged) from a box, and riffle shuffle it twice, pass it to be cut, and still be guaranteed a win.<p>And don't forget that there are professionals that, with enough practice, could take an actually fresh deck and come up with a way to shuffle it so that it ends up a Joffe deck.  In fact, one could come up with a sorting algorithm that takes the different types of sorts available (riffle, cut, hindu, faro, etc) and figure out the optimal path to get a Joffe deck.

I guess that is the beauty of these machines in certain ways they have not changed much. It is somewhere in the era of 40's or 50's, as you mentioned. One thing to bare in mind about these machines is that they are designed for a specific purpose and that purpose is not that great for a standard civilian vehicle. The military jeeps where all dowel and pin fastened which allowed them to be broken down and repaired rapidly but it was at the sacrifice of high speed. With items like the leafs dowel and pinned they rattled like an SOB at any thing over 40mph which results in a pretty wild ride.<p><i>The suspension in modern jeeps is far more complex in order to give a smoother ride -- the jeep in the video has leaf springs on front and back. Modern jeeps typically don't have leafs in the front.</i><p>A lot of modern off road suspensions are a 3 or 4 link suspension set up. They can be dowel and pinned as well, and can be broken down faster than a leaf sprung vehicle, but again you suffer from the fact that they is play in the suspension components, that is not there with a bolt fastened suspension.<p>The point is, that while it is a great engineering feat to build such simplicity, there is also some huge sacrifices that you make to achieve such simplicity. Safety and high speed performance being the top two.<p>The JEEP is a great machine and I recommend them to anyone who wants to get into off-road motor sports, they are probably the best beginners vehicle one can buy. As they can grow with someone as they get deeper into the hobby.<p>As well there is no other off-road vehicle available that has the aftermarket availability of products that JEEP does. I say that as an owner of a 68 Bronco. The JEEP is a well respected vehicle for motor-sports hobbyist. It is one that they got right from the beginning. The original Bronco and the International Scout are great choices as well.",1284248724

Yeah, it doesn't perform well at all.<p>Compared to Java? I'd say modern Java runtimes are faster in general.<p>Compared to Javascript? I'd like to see some benchmarks with modern runtimes like v8, but I'd wager that Flash (Actionscript) performs better.<p>Here's a rather old comparison benchmark. <a href=""http://oddhammer.com/actionscriptperformance/set4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oddhammer.com/actionscriptperformance/set4/</a><p>According to this, ActionScript 3 and Flash Player 9 were approaching Java Applet speed in many of the tests.<p>Here's a newer one <a href=""http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/232"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/232</a><p>In this test, Safari, FF 3.5.2 and AS3 all have about the same runtime. Every other browser tested run 2-9x slower.<p>And another followup <a href=""http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/534"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jacksondunstan.com/articles/534</a>
The results are about the same.<p>Here's a very recent one (March 2010) with similar results.
<a href=""http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2010/03/22/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2010/03/22/</a><p>Flash performs about as well as the very best Javascript implementations out there, and far <i>far</i> better than most implementations of Javascript that live in the browsers that are actually being used in the world.<p>I understand your point, Adobe has provided some rather abysmal ports of Flash to platforms other than Windows. But on the platforms it has been ported to (no matter how flawed) it runs about as well as the best available implementation of Javascript on that platform.<p>As for video, Adobe, for some reason isn't offloading video decoding to your GPU. That could be problem of your platform, or a problem of Adobe. But just the same Javascript isn't rendering the video on your Linux box when you watch a video...you certainly wouldn't want that. Talk about bad performance!<p>But we aren't talking about video when we talk about HTML5 and Flash. Video is a separate and distinct problem. Flash didn't even support video until quite late in it's life cycle, it's an ""oh yeah let's toss this in too"" feature. We're talking about making interactive applications in those respective environments. And we're talking about those applications being cross platforms, running on multiple systems, on multiple platforms, in multiple form factors.<p>And for that, <i>right now</i> flash is the better platform, it performs about as well in raw computation as the very best Javascript engines, has a better development environment, <i>is currently</i> more cross platform than a similarly complex Javascript HTML 5 app, and is generally a more mature technology.<p>I can't even get a complex HTML 5 app to run the same on 3 different browsers on the same machine! Imagine targeting every major browser that run under Windows, OSX, Linux, iPhones, the iPad and Android devices with HTML5 technologies! It's simply not there <i>yet</i>.",1284248342

That is, the quality that every point in the interface has prompts and actions attached to it from which you can learn what to do next. Does your project have this quality?</i><p>A good interface can look like anything so long as it follows good GUI conventions. And fortunately most OSs follow pretty good GUI conventions so targeting the conventions of that platform <i>are</i> in a way following good GUI conventions transitively. I just wouldn't limit myself as to say that the measure of important should be following OS conventions when it should really be following interface conventions. The CUPS story I linked to brings that problem directly to the forefront. They're already doing the appropriate interface rituals with respect to their OS. The problem is that they are not doing the appropriate rituals with respect to good interface design.<p>(I also agree that some tools, like Photoshop, have absymal user interfaces.

I am an experienced player, and I can't see how the limited value of this in a real game compensates for the incredible downside of being caught cheating.<p>Making money at (cash game, not tournament) poker doesn't have much to do with your cards. To make money you have to convince another player with a second-best hand to put money in the pot. In that sense it's all about the other players' cards.<p>And in order to get a ""huge payoff"" your opponents must hold cards that justify calling a huge bet. But almost none of the second-best hands in these decks are anywhere near strong enough to justify committing any significant amount of money to the pot.<p>Things get more interesting if in fact a deck can be found that gives multiple players ""big"" hands. But that is a lot harder, and kind of subjective. For instance, would you call a pot-sized raise on the river holding the 10 of spades with four lower spades on the board? I know I wouldn't, even though a flush is a ""big"" hand.<p>I guess ultimately it comes down to the fact that poker is a mostly situational game. And one that is played out over the course of many hands. Knowing that you will definitely win one hand during a session where you may see 200 hands doesn't really do you much good.<p>That said, it is a cool party trick.<p>P.S.

Hopefully it and the answers will help others entrepreneurs as they make their own choices.<p>Last year, I did a semester of basic courses for college, then took a break to do business. I'm now working part time while in college full time, doing the basic pre-requisite courses. I am still a freshman.<p>While I'm not a hacker and have no technical computer skills, I've been running various businesses since I was fourteen. I fully intend to work for myself for the majority of my life, and only take jobs that teach me something valuable (which my current job is doing in spades)<p>Which leaves the question: As I go through college, what should I focus on?<p>My college has an entrepreneurship major, but I think most of it would be too basic for me at this point - simple business basics. Marketing and management courses don't really change the way you think - they're just ideas you can get from books and experience. I also feel it might not expand my mind, as I already read enough about that stuff every day on HN and my google reader, as well as countless business books.<p>My absolute favorite professor was one most students despised. He taught music and believed a competent person primarily has the ability to take things from one field of knowledge and apply them to others in creative ways. His music class connected all over the place and was brilliant and had brilliant discussions.<p>My plan right now is this:<p>Make an ad hoc major. Focus on courses in:
- Communication: Verbal and written. This is probably the most important. I posted about learning how to write better before, and I also want to master public speaking. I'm particularly interested in how excellent story tellers such as Roald Dahl work - they're spellbinding. As a bonus, I would like to learn the art of conversation more, and how to mingle with any group and put them at ease.<p>Quantitative analysis: I always hated math in High School, but in the business world, I love slicing and dicing metrics to get the insights from them. Google analytics is my love. I'm not sure what college level courses really entail, but taking a few would hopefully meld my mindset to be even more effective at seeing through numbers.<p>History: This has always been fascinating to me, and useful for business, as human nature doesn't really change. I feel a good professor in this field can offer much more than a book, since a lot of history's details don't seem to be widely known. On this liberal arts note, philosophy seems interesting to me (specifically picking apart logic) but I fear it might be too theoretical to apply much to real life issues.<p>I feel the things above might be the best courses for my goals.

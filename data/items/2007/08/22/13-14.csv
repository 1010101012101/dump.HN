Google makes the transition from text ads that are benign and often relevant to moving ads that cover the screen, with transparent backgrounds making them ambiguous to close. <p>I hate ads.<p>Another video site (either Break or MetaCafe), constantly had animated ads for the movie 300 overlaid on top of the video area. Very annoying.",1187791107

45188,comment,45082,45134,0,0,jmzachary,,,">> The Art of Computer Programming, by Knuth\n> Too dense and theoretical, even for someone who enjoys it. Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserston, Rivest and Stein is more understandable and practical. It does cover everything useful and is thorough, it just isn't pedantic.<p>I completely agree. I own three volumnes of TACP and have very rarely used them. They look good and give instant programmer cred when you utter their titles, but they just haven't proven that useful to me. CLRS, however, is a staple on my programming bookshelf and is well worn. <p>I'll add Programming Pearls and The Mythical Man-Month to the list that is already growing. Both of those books have given me really good insights over the years.\n",1187790085

This was an attempt at snarky humor.<p>My larger point is that advertising is one model for new startups...but not the only model. Advertising is effective when you have a large, targeted audience, with a willingness to buy/explore ads. Some audiences are too small, or so diverse and random that ads will not work.<p>There are other revenue models that will work.<p>Don",1187789624

I assume the read side is indexed appropriately so MySQL finds the right part on the disk almost instantly.  Do you think it is a locking issue then, e.g. table lock vs row lock?

I've found it to be really memory efficient. <p>I've been using MySQL with Apache::DBI for years and it's usually brilliant - I ran WorkZoo.com, a high traffic job search engine with a combination of MySQL and a full-text api.<p>With feedjit I'm basically storing weblogs. I either have to dump them into a single table and query that - which is what I was doing and the high query rate with read/write was a problem - or have lots of individual tables which isn't feasible after about 500 with MySQL. So small files works best for me. <p><p>",1187788252

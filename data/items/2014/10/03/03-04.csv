8404258,comment,8401163,8403129,1,0,doorhammer,,,"> But have you personally tried it? The most important &quot;evidence&quot; may be how it affects you, personally.<p>It sounds lame to say, but I agree here.  I fairly consistently meditate.  I don&#x27;t spend more than five or ten minutes doing so, but regardless of whether or not it increases an objective measure of my health, I do feel that it&#x27;s provided me with some positive mental tools for approaching certain situations.<p>As an example for me is that I used to be pretty anxious about falling asleep, and I think it caused it to be more difficult to fall asleep.  Some of the insight meditation practices helped me deal with the anxiety feedback loop.  It wasn&#x27;t something crazy or mystical; I mostly just learned how to stop thinking about something, and was able to stop thinking about the anxiety.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I fall asleep any faster, but I do find that I just don&#x27;t care anymore because the anxiety isn&#x27;t there.<p>I continue with it because it&#x27;s pretty easy to carve out five or ten minutes here and there.  I have no idea if it&#x27;s causing any long term health benefits.  Subjectively I feel more relaxed right after I meditate, but that&#x27;s about it.  Honestly, I&#x27;d keep doing it just because it feels nice. I don&#x27;t do any crazy postures or full lotus, or anything like that, so it seems like there&#x27;s a low likelihood of it causing harm.<p>My two cents",1412308718

If that&#x27;s really not enough for them to continue maintaining and improving their infrastructure perhaps it would be an issue - but it certainly appears to have been sufficient here at least.",1412308641

8404240,comment,8402010,8403686,4,0,azakai,,,"> I&#x27;ve never understood how biologists could argue non-selfish evolution couldn&#x27;t be a thing. If you look at groups of organisms as systems, and you pit the systems against each other, surely eventually the system that evolved to be superior would win in the end, regardless of whether that means any subspecies in that group of organisms would evolve to not reproduce?<p>Of course, <i>all other things equal</i>, when you pit groups against each other then group selection will occur. But the problem is that a huge body of science, both theoretical (game theory) and observational, argues that things are not equal: At the same time as the groups are competing, there is in-group competition. There has to be, because the groups consist of organisms that are being selected for, unless someone can propose a mechanism that would suppress that.<p>What this means is that group selection is <i>unstable</i>. A group behavior might be selected for, but individuals in the successful group will still be selected for &quot;selfishly&quot; - normally - breaking the pattern. If selection operates on the gene level - and almost all biologists believe it does - then it is inherently going to act on a scale much smaller than that of groups, and in an inevitable manner. And that is going to destabilize any group selection.<p>For these reasons it was thought that altruism couldn&#x27;t be easily explained through evolution. That&#x27;s why kin selection, reciprocal alruism, and a few other theories are so revolutionary - they show how useful group behaviors arise from selection at the gene level.<p>> Is it not just a question of whether evolution could produce specialized one-offs that don&#x27;t reproduce but do serve a purpose?<p>That does occur in the &quot;eusocial&quot; animals, such as ants and bees. But it is generally believed that happens due to how genes are passed on in those insects (different than we are used to among mammals), and they are a large exception. In practically every species we are aware of, group-level selection does not occur. Hence any evidence, as in this article, is very interesting.",1412308350

The AWS machines they are using should be c3.4xlarge which are 30GB, and 6 of them is 180GB. But you can&#x27;t run an in-memory column store at 100% RAM, you need to run it at 50-70% so you have capacity for calculations.<p>Is it just me or do the results not make any sense?

That is, as in the OP, I&#x27;m failing\nto see how &quot;both sides of the table&quot; ever have much\nchance of shaking hands.<p>Why?  From all I can see, and as mentioned in the\nOP, to be considered for any funding at all, even\nvia an accelerator, the startup needs to have a\nproduct that has traction in the market with that\ntraction growing.<p>Before that traction, the guys with the checkbooks\nare not interested.  With that traction, like the\nguys in the OP, I wonder why the heck the founders\nwould want to take the term sheet, deal details,\ncheck, Delaware C Corp., Board of Directors, etc.\ninstead of just growing, as in the OP,\n&quot;organically&quot;.<p>Sure, I can imagine some exceptions, but the OP\ncompany was just two guys.  Moreover, in the\ncurrently running Stanford course by Sam Altman and\nYC, the strong advice is to have 2-3 founders for a\nlong time and be very slow to add anyone else.<p>So, the OP company had two founders, traction\nsignificant and growing, and, thus, qualified for\nsome funding but with so few founders likely had\nexpenses only at the Ramem noodle level and had some\nrevenue and maybe free cash flow.<p>So, why take an equity check and all that comes with\nit instead of just continuing to grow <i>organically</i>?<p>Or, net, in simplest terms, it appears that by the\ntime a startup, based on information technology and\nsoftware where the product exists and has traction\nand was developed by a team of just 2-3, qualifies\nfor funding, it will rarely still need or even want\nit.<p>So, I&#x27;m losing just where the guys with the\ncheckbooks expect to find startups they want to fund\nthat will take the funding.<p>Yes, I can think of some exceptions, but otherwise,\nagain, I&#x27;m not <i>getting it</i> on how anyone could\nexpect the two sides of the table to do a deal?<p>Two more points:<p>First, all across the US, Atlantic to Pacific,\nborder to border, in crossroads, villages, up to the\nlargest cities, the US is just awash in successful\nsmall businesses with 1-3 founders, often just 1,\nwho do well.  Indeed, from all I&#x27;ve seen, most of\nthe nicer houses, 50 foot yachts, full tuition\nchecks at private schools and colleges, late model\nluxury cars, etc. are paid for by such small\nbusiness people.<p>These successful small business people rarely went\nto business school, never watched lectures on\nbusiness such as the current YC course at Stanford,\nnever went to an accelerator, and never got VC\nfunding.<p>For being an information technology startup with a\nproduct just software and written by just 1-3\nfounders and with revenue, that should be one heck\nof an advantage compared with nearly all the rest of\nthese millions of successful small businesses.  If\nthose millions of US small businesses can get to a\ngood <i>life style</i> business, then the founders of a\ngood information technology startup should be able\nto, also.  And for further growth, a successful\ninformation technology startup should be able to\ngenerate plenty of free cash flow -- some software\non a server can run by itself and make money sending\nads 24 x 7 but for a guy with a successful pizza\nshop, or 10 such, each pizza has to be made by hand.<p>Then, with that nice start as a lifestyle business,\nmaybe that information technology startup could\ncontinue rapid growth to be a major company.<p>I know; I know; there is a PG essay that a <i>startup</i>\nis intended for explosive growth and, thus, needs\nequity funding.  Okay, but I&#x27;m missing just why the\nfounders won&#x27;t be happy with $20 million or $200\nmillion and, instead, want to take on a lot of\nfinancial risk and burdens shooting for $2 billion\nto $20 billion.  A rich guy can easily say, &quot;I\nwouldn&#x27;t walk across a street for another $1\nmillion.&quot;.<p>But in all of this, I&#x27;m missing just where the\naccelerators or early stage VCs have a meaningful\nrole to play.  The VCs look like the Drawback on a\nfootball team, a third person twiddling their thumbs\nin a two person canoe, a fifth wheel on a wagon,\nmammary glands on a boar hog, or someone who wants\nto buy a ticket on an airplane after it has already\nleft the ground.<p>Second, I have to be reminded of the Mother Goose\nstory <i>The Little Red Hen</i> who found some grains of\nwheat but discovered that no one wanted to help her\nuntil she already had on her own built a bakery and\nhad hot, fragrant loaves of bread and a line of\neager customers and didn&#x27;t need any help.",1412307488

The business side of things is coming along, I&#x27;ve just finished up a hectic few months (wedding, honeymoon) and am looking to crank on the site again. Long term I want the site to be an ever-growing part of my life.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in collaborations, and helping people sprinkle an intuitive approach into whatever teaching they are doing. (I like Bret Victor&#x27;s approach, where he provides guidance on what programming tools could look like, which might work its way into new programming languages like Swift, etc.). I&#x27;m in touch with an internet buddy at Khan Academy and have been meaning to work together, I&#x27;ll be reaching out soon I think :).",1412305920

Understanding how someone feels should not guide the way we evaluate their actions or decisions, the trite example being rather evil people in history genuinely believed what they were doing was good - if you just &quot;looked from their shoes&quot; you might altogether miss the evilness of what they were doing.<p>Many people claim that without empathy there would be moral chaos. They are equivalent to people who claim that without religion there would be moral chaos. Empathy is not the basis of morality.",1412305820

Say I kept a bunch of people&#x27;s information in paper files in file cabinets.  Then I gave you access to retrieve yours from the file drawer yourself.  It is sleazy, but not necessarily illegal to look at other files in the drawer, as I have given you access to their container.<p>(c) Even if you want to make the action in (b) illegal, the reasonable punishment is almost certainly not a double digit prison sentence.",1372773596

I can update it any time I want.<p>You can&#x27;t. You have some crazy manual system of packaging these compiled libraries then distributing them via some private repo. For what? You gain nothing. Now all deployments are some house of cards game of trying to get the sysadmin to package up the right X when you need it. Instead of the devs being able to deploy directly. Why would you even bother?<p>> I get that it&#x27;s comforting to travel in a herd.<p>Stop trying to paint yourself as the sole voice of reason in an insane world.

My read of the Russian case is that they suggested he might get asylum there if he basically drops off the radar and stops releasing things or being politically involved, and he refused that condition. To be willing to give him an <i>active</i> base to work from going forward more or less requires a country that either doesn&#x27;t care or actively wants to snub the US, and doesn&#x27;t mind that he might keep doing things that will continue to antagonize the US for years into the future.<p>That&#x27;s one reason I think the Bobby Fischer asylum was easier for Iceland: he was wanted by the U.S. for a one-time thing, violating sanctions by playing a for-profit chess match in Serbia. There was not much chance he would be an ongoing thorn in the side of US-Icelandic relations post-asylum, since he could hardly continue to violate US sanctions from Iceland.

We are historically a rebellious, freedom-loving nation (just think of the the anti-communist movement, many uprisings against foreign occupants). So Snowden might be hoping for some public support from Poland&#x27;s youth.<p>But yeah, if you remember how stupidly long the Polish government held out in their support of ACTA (despite its having few advantages for Poland), you have to realize that the US Government can be very persuasive.",1372773189

The one that works in crap conditions because if he don&#x27;t he will get deported, or the one that although he could not quit (unless he was abused, the law allowed it in those cases) he had anything he might need because the law said so?<p>It is easy to label a word as evil, or good, but words are used to label and describe things, you should not use words to label other words.<p>I would describe the situations that those people face as evil, having almost no money, and forced to work, because although they can quit, the only result from that will be starvation.<p>I also think that student debt is evil, I am one, of countless people, that struggles to make ends meet without even having a family, people that when the debt is paid, will be far behind non-indebted peers, I think it is funny that during the high-point of my career in money terms, I earned more than some family chefs that I know, and ended with LESS money, purely because good part of my money was in studies expenses (paying student debt and other university related costs).<p>Free, is a friend of mine, that refused to go to university, searched for a low paying but permanent job as manual worker at night, and slowly built his career, debt free, while he still has a blue collar job, he has a motorbike, surplus money, enough money to start a family, and his job is stable. It pains other people that went with school with him, that they got into college, and are now forced to work in &quot;well paying&quot; jobs but with no chance of career improvement or stability to pay their debts, while the &quot;dumb&quot; guy that decided to ignore college and take his time to choose his first job, is the one well off.<p>Slavery == evil? I don&#x27;t think so... it is a word, that describe many things, some of those evil, some not.\nCollege == success? I don&#x27;t think so... it is a word, that describe a institution, the context, the process, and many other things, define what happens to you.<p>Now why I am writing all that? I have no idea.

I never told Consumer Reports I wanted my subscription to recur, and it provides absolutely <i>zero</i> value to me that they did so. If they hid text somewhere for this, it is a clear and obvious example that the industry desperately needs onerous rules and restrictions prohibiting this, such as a customer yearly opt in and double-positive recurrence opt-in (rather than some hidden subtext that oh by the way we have your credit card so have fun cancelling sucker).<p>2) Hide methods of cancelling said subscription behind as many layers as possibly: It is shocking how easy it is to sign up for many things versus what is needed to cancel the same (as if charges on my credit card are less of an issue for me than the possibility that online access might be temporarily delayed). In Consumer Reports case, you could not email or fill out an online form -- the single and only option was a limited hours telephone number that required lengthy wait times. They <i>know</i> that many people will avoid the time sucking tax. Xbox Live had a particularly hilarious system where not only did you have to phone a call center and sit on hold, your cancellation had to be immediate (despite the fact that all payments were for future services, when you disabled recurrence they immediately downgraded your account) which of course is meant to delay people from jumping through the hoops until the last day when they might forget or give up and boom, another month.<p>While much noise was raised about Apple shaking down the subscription industry on the iOS platform, they will have to simply eat that cost because people like me have absolutely zero trust in the industry, and I greatly respect how Apple not only constantly reminds me of subscriptions, they make cancelling any of them the easiest thing in the world, so those services that want subscribers need to actually work<p>Recurrence is a tax on the world. It is inefficient and obnoxious companies that turn their business model towards unsavoury tactics rather than actually providing value that keeps people from wanting to be their customer.<p>1) By reading this post you agree to subscribe to future posts at the economical cost of $14.49 per month, billed bi-annually.",1372773153

Of the people signing the petition, there are people who think that their team is for a pardon, and people who actually hold an opinion personally and are for a pardon.  The former group might well have a different opinion next week if they believe their team does.  The latter group are mostly those who were hard-core Obama supporters, whether or not they still are.  The largest remaining block of people in the latter group are libertarians, but there are probably few of them.   I would guess that right-leaning people who are outraged about the NSA activities would nevertheless feel uncomfortable calling for a pardon for Snowden.",1372771897

8579379,comment,8574184,8578647,0,0,yohanatan,,,"There are several languages targeting the JVM these days. And, what obviously sets Clojure apart from other JVM languages is its Lispiness (i.e., the JVM is constant across JVM languages).<p>Clojure is not married to the JVM either-- in fact, it has been hinted that it would jump ship if something better comes along or the current situation becomes less viable. Furthermore we already have a dialect of Clojure called ClojureScript which targets JavaScript/node/V8.<p>And, I look at the JVM as really merely a library/API/runtime. C++ has STL and stdio and such and they are not part of the language proper but rather merely libraries for interacting with the underlying operating system (in a platform independent way). The same is true for the JVM with respect to Clojure and Scala et al.",1415519832

Many artists treat their original processes like trade secrets, or only make any effort to share them with their immediate circle of friends.<p>The &quot;Why&quot; described is that when the instrument is a single computer running a DAW, it has poor concurrency. You could change the instrument model instead to one that re-enables concurrency. You are doing the inverse presumably because you haven&#x27;t had a good jam session before and only feel comfortable sitting behind the DAW. To get around this problem, you&#x27;re rationalizing a process which is actually less efficient than jamming, as it straightjackets the creativity into a &quot;waterfall&quot; process instead of an &quot;agile&quot; one.",1415519638

When I first started consulting, it was a nice opportunity to decompress from startup life and enjoy a job where I could basically clock in and clock out. A few months later, I was ready to start picking up some responsibility. I ended up joining the client permanently and it&#x27;s been great so far.<p>On the side, I advise startups a bit, which is cool because it lets me keep the lessons I learned in my own startup fresh. I&#x27;ve come up with a couple interesting startup ideas myself, but I don&#x27;t feel pressed to be a founder again any time soon.<p>I&#x27;d consider doing a startup again down the line, but I&#x27;d be very discriminating. I&#x27;m entering a more risk averse stage of life, and I think I&#x27;d rather position myself to join something as a leader that&#x27;s already at least somewhat proven but still has a lot of upside.

Our client list gave some real credibility there, as did being able to talk a good talk and looking presentable in a suit.<p>I suspect this was a phenomenal career move: the previous startup CTO stuff, and any future small-company CTO stuff will be &quot;real&quot; in the eyes of recruiters because I&#x27;ve also managed a big team, budgets, etc - the &quot;real CTO&quot; role validates all the hacking code at smaller companies while claiming to be CTO.<p>I think there can be a credibility gap for a 30 year old team leader at a profitless company calling themselves a CTO, but having also done a more traditional CTO role at a bigger company allows you to regain that credibility. I can talk confidently about CapEx, OpEx, I&#x27;ve been through a rubber-glove-type due diligence process, been deeply involved in high-level strategy ... I feel like I could spend the next ten years doing 3 people startups again, but then walk in to another &quot;big&quot; CTO role if it didn&#x27;t work out because of this.<p>Anyway, ultimately that wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to do, as much as it was incredible experience. So the wife and I packed off to somewhere warm and cheap, she has a job that pays the bills and for the flat. I&#x27;m keeping myself busy by running a one-person R&D lab for a large listed company whose industry I have domain knowledge in, finishing my dissertation, and I&#x27;ve branched in to staffing because it&#x27;s amazing how much quick cash you can make by messaging ex-coworkers on Facebook (and if you&#x27;re a Perl developer in the UK: <a href=""http://perl.careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.careers/</a>)",1415519247
8579367,comment,8575623,8577224,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> Please, I invite you to post your credit card records for the past year here. We&#x27;ll be happy to look over them and leave some comments for you. After all, you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, yes?<p>That&#x27;s a ridiculous counter argument.  If I buy a bunch of towels/etc. from an online merchant, I have every reason to believe they will not use any information they gather to publicly embarrass me or otherwise do me ill will.  Their business relies on them not abusing their customers.  If they showed any indication that they aren&#x27;t trustworthy, I wouldn&#x27;t do business with them.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t have any reason to trust someone on the internet requesting my credit card records in exchange for the privilege of being publicly embarrassed when they post it on the internet.  The argument is never &quot;I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot;, the argument is that I have no reason to hide my Amazon purchases from Amazon.<p>Most of your examples are either non-issues or not realistic.  My credit card company does have a right to see how much and where I&#x27;m spending - I&#x27;m borrowing their money when I make a purchase.  I don&#x27;t know of any service I use that sends my porn history to my boss (unless I decided to do it at work on computers owned by my employer).  I don&#x27;t know of any supermarket discount program that prevents you from shopping elsewhere - every rewards program I&#x27;ve ever seen is structured to encourage you to shop with them more, not punish you for shopping elsewhere.  My wife has every right to scrutinize our bank account - if I didn&#x27;t trust her I wouldn&#x27;t have married her.  If she finds out what her birthday present was, that&#x27;s her loss for ruining the surprise, not mine.  My annoying jealous nephew can get over himself - if he wants to come on trips with me then he needs to be less annoying.<p>If I don&#x27;t want any of these things posted publicly on the internet, I a) won&#x27;t post them publicly on the internet, and b) won&#x27;t share the information with anyone that I don&#x27;t trust to refrain from posting it publicly to the internet.  Anonymity is not the same as privacy - privacy comes from keeping personal information to yourself.<p>So, to reiterate the grandparent poster asked, why does a distributed marketplace intended for legal trade need to run on Tor? Do you need anonymity if you&#x27;re selling towels?",1415519218

In fact one of the first hits on Google for &quot;SoundCloud downloader&quot; is a website that claims to do just that (I didn&#x27;t try it but I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s functional - likely on a mobile device too.)<p><i>Data storage and file management is difficult, especially within the UX constraints on mobile devices</i><p>This is a very common excuse (&quot;security&quot; is the other one) to justify the increasing constraints on what mobile devices can do - when I think it&#x27;s really about <i>control</i> over the users. On my desktop, I can double-click files to open them in the app they&#x27;re associated with, and double-click apps to open them too. I can save files anywhere, including the desktop, and they&#x27;ll be as accessible as apps. I can use one app to interact with files I created with another one. I have an Android phone and despite it having more processing power and screen resolution than desktops a decade ago, it is nowhere near as flexible. Apps are mostly locked into accessing only the data they&#x27;ve created, with the exception of external storage (which is also starting to disappear). This app-centric model means that working with files/documents is difficult; I can&#x27;t easily save a file into a folder and have it show up as an icon on the home screen. From what I&#x27;ve read, iOS and WP isn&#x27;t so different in this respect.<p>In the context of something like SoundCloud, the motivation for this model and their removal request isn&#x27;t so obscure: DRM. Google wants services like SoundCloud and other media providers to get the impression that they are on their side, so its decisions are aimed at restricting users&#x27; ability to share and remix content freely. Ideally to them, everything must be done via an app, which Google must approve, and which cannot do anything someone else disapproves of...<p>Thanks for opening the source; the Play Store is not the world and the app will live on outside of it, possibly with further improvements from others.

For instance, doing pencil and paper arithmetic by rote is nothing more than executing algorithms. The algorithms work on an input representation, and contain various cases to be considered, terminating conditions, and outputs produced in the appropriate areas of the paper.",1442620773

10242713,comment,10242529,10242529,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Are they incompetent, or do they just have different success criteria? In theory, managers are supposed to be dedicated to advancing the interests of the shareholders, and a board of directors supervises their managerial activity. But an individual manager may be much more interested in maximizing his own wealth, and may occupy a job only for as long as he can make a lot of money without getting into trouble, moving on to another firm as soon as he sees that his tenure is unsustainable (but before everyone else has worked out that he&#x27;s a liability). I mean, why work hard at managing a widget factory if you can more profitably devote your time to learning about doohickeys and playing golf with the owners of the doohickey factory across town?<p>While I agree with the author&#x27;s contention that businesses are bad at hiring managers and so reward pathological candidates, I disagree with his assumption that they&#x27;re merely incompetent as opposed to self-serving. There&#x27;s also the question of whether corporate boards are always aligned with the interests of shareholders. I know of one small-cap firm that brought in a new CEO who began alienating everyone in sight almost immediately, and whose previous appointments had generated a small forest of red flags, which would have been very obvious to the board. Not long after the new broom arrived the share price fell, the firm was de-listed...and the former founder-CEO sold his shares at a loss, lost his seat on the board, and the firm&#x27;s IP and book of business were transferred for a song to another firm owned by other directors. (Writing it this way it sounds wildly illegal but my impression was that the activity fell into the unethical-but-legal grey area. Of course I am leaving out a lot of ancillary details, not least to avoid slandering anyone.)",1442620165

10242528,comment,10238797,10238797,0,0,336f5,,,"&quot;I discovered that at least one person in Europe in the 1730s not only knew about Buddhism but had studied Buddhist philosophy for years. His name was Ippolito Desideri, and he had been a Jesuit missionary in Tibet. In 1728, just before Hume began the Treatise, Desideri finished his book, the most complete and accurate European account of Buddhist philosophy to be written until the 20th century. The catch was that it wasn’t published. No Catholic missionary could publish anything without the approval of the Vatican—and officials there had declared that Desideri’s book could not be printed. The manuscript disappeared into the Church’s archives...Desideri accepted the challenge. He spent the next five years in the Buddhist monasteries tucked away in the mountains around Lhasa. The monasteries were among the largest academic institutions in the world at the time. Desideri embarked on their 12-year-long curriculum in theology and philosophy. He composed a series of Christian tracts in Tibetan verse, which he presented to the king. They were beautifully written on the scrolls used by the great Tibetan libraries, with elegant lettering and carved wooden cases...He also translated the work of the great Buddhist philosopher Tsongkhapa into Italian. In his book, Desideri describes Tibetan Buddhism in great and accurate detail, especially in one volume titled “Of the False and Peculiar Religion Observed in Tibet.” He explains emptiness, karma, reincarnation, and meditation, and he talks about the Buddhist denial of the self...Desideri overcame Himalayan blizzards, mountain torrents, and war. But bureaucratic infighting got him in the end. Rival missionaries, the Capuchins, were struggling bitterly with the Jesuits over evangelical turf, and they claimed Tibet for themselves. Michelangelo Tamburini, the head of the Jesuits, ordered Desideri to return to Europe immediately, until the territory dispute was settled. The letter took two years to reach Tibet, but once it arrived, in 1721, Desideri had no choice. He had to leave. He spent the next 11 years writing and rewriting his book and appealing desperately to the Vatican to let him return to Tibet. It had clearly become the only place where he really felt that he was himself. In 1732 the authorities finally ruled—in favor of the Capuchins. His book would not be published and he could never return. He died four months later.&quot;<p>How truly awful. He mastered Tibetan, spent decades studying the profoundest and subtlest Buddhist philosophy with great success, wrote it all up for the Europeans back home whose understanding was de minimis, and from reading old books I could well credit that his work was superior to anything published until 1900 (or perhaps later) - implying the Catholic Church singlehandedly set back understanding by over 179 years, for reasons that strike one as either incompetent or psychopathicly malicious.<p>And this is just the summary by Gopnik, who is trying to paint the Catholic Church in as positive, tolerant, and globalizing a way as possible!",1442617388

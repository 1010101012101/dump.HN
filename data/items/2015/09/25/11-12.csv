Most properties proven (well, maybe not proven but satisfactorily verified) with TLA+ (or any other sophisticated verification tool) just can&#x27;t be proven in Haskell. And, again, I even prefer TLA+ to JPF (which is the tool I&#x27;ve had most experience with) which verifies Java bytecode directly because so far I find it more effective to verify only the core components of the algorithm. Verifying the details is usually a waste of effort (they both make the verification harder -- either harder to prove if you&#x27;re doing a formal proof, or much longer to run in a model checker -- and they are easy to verify by other, informal means).",1443181211

The Go garbage collector will never get triggered, and any Go code should treat anything below %esp after the call completes as uninitialized data.<p>I should give a more thorough explanation.<p>If you call C code, the only way that would be useful is if we pass Go-allocated buffers to the C code. This only works if we pass to the C code untyped uintptr&#x27;s, which must live on the stack because of garbage collector reasons.<p>In your hypothetical world, you want to call C code on the g stacks. This can only works if the g stacks are copied into a larger stack. The stack copying mechanism inspects the stack map to see which pointers need updating. This stack map is also used by the garbage collector, but I shouldn&#x27;t have mentioned it in my original post.<p>The stack copying mechanism can&#x27;t update the untyped uintptr&#x27;s living on the stack, therefore you can&#x27;t call C code on the g stack.<p>There are other reasons why calling C code on the g stack would be a bad idea but I won&#x27;t get into them.

This would allow electric aircraft to be considerably lighter than hydrocarbon vehicles, even considering the current energy-density of batteries.<p>Beamed-energy flight systems are being developed for space launch[1], but I don&#x27;t know of anybody yet doing this for plain old aviation.

I don&#x27;t want to write about them for the sake of writing something, but because I find the topic interesting. It&#x27;s like the kid who is exploring a forest and found a cave, and is excited about the cave and wants to share that excitement.<p>So I think the first thing you need to evaluate is whether you really want to write and why. If the answer is you want to seem sophisticated and earn the intellectual respect of being a writer then I can&#x27;t give you any advice except that maybe you should reconsider the decision to write. Write about topics that interest you. Where does your mind wander when you are in the shower? That&#x27;s what you should write about. In most cases this is not a topic that you&#x27;ve already fully understood. Those topics aren&#x27;t interesting any more because you already know the answers.

It&#x27;s not about form factor it&#x27;s about computing power and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the latest iPad Pro or even top-end smartphone had the computing power to do these calculations locally.<p>2) My 3D Printing Systems UP Mini does the heavy lifting on my local PC and then sends that data off to the printer where the printer stores it in memory.

Around 11,600 are imprisoned for &quot;technical violations&quot; of their probation or parole terms, rather than because they committed a new crime. In 11 states such juvenile prisoners outnumber those in for crimes against other people. In only one state (Massachusetts) did juveniles imprisoned for crimes committed against people comprise a majority of juvenile prisoners. Around 3,000 are locked up for things that aren&#x27;t crimes for adults, &quot;such as running away, truancy and incorrigibility.&quot; Incarcerated children are less likely to graduate high-school and more likely to spend time in prison as adults. If America is interested in reducing its prison population, locking up fewer juveniles for silly reasons would be a good place to start.",1443179482

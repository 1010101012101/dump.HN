189525,comment,187977,189297,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Most of the excerpt lengths are from the feeds, though I am cutting it off after one paragraph.  The idea is you would quickly move through them and click through to the story if you want.<p>I don't understand your question about the new page.  Can you please expand?  There shouldn't be a new page load for each story, i.e. when you hit the arrow keys it should be taking the excerpts from memory.<p>As for the feed choice, these are just general interest feeds of course.  I've thought about custom feeds, but then this just becomes another feed reader (and a worse one at that).  I think its usefulness stems from the aggregation, i.e. you do no work to get a snapshot of the most emailed stories out there.  And since they are not your feeds, you don't really care if you miss something.<p>That being said, I can really see some sub-watrcoolrs.  What would you think of a hacker oriented one?  Any feed ideas?<p>Also, what do you mean by ""no-cycling?""  Thanks for the feedback.",1210769343

Who's the fricking expert on software development?  Not the managers.  If you focus on meeting everyone's needs lower down on the food chain-- and invest in tools in techniques that multiply your ability to maintain and extend the code-- then your development will be so tight and your response to issues will be so comprehensive that the ""play it safe"" types will have nothing they can say to you.  (Except maybe that they'd rather have more buttons or something.)  If you're a responisible developer, you'll be addressing the ""slightly wrong"" stuff well before the middle managers even hear about it.  You'll have a relationship with the real value-adders such that they talk to you instead of your bosses.  You, after all, are the one that gets stuff done quietly and thoroughly.<p>Sheesh.  They're ""play it safe"" types.  Think about it.  Once the code is up and running, <i>they're</i> not going to be to be suggesting any changes.  Suddenly you're the status quo and they'll defend your work by saying ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" just like they said about the previous solution.",1210767467

Our team has been fortunate in the fact that after Tom moved away in high school, he decided to become a programming genius. To add a little bit to what Tom said...<p>Because of the nature of our project, numerous parties and moving parts are involved. For better or for worse, there's lot of ""business stuff"" to do on a daily basis. Looking at some of the other YC projects, I could definitely understand the advantages of having two hackers or one hacker and one designer. However, for our project, our skills are extremely complimentary of each other and well aligned with the work that needs to be done.<p>One caveat, I have built a few simple websites from scratch before and taken a couple programming classes so it's not like I know nothing about programming although Tom would probably argue otherwise :).",1210766804

Think about it as a comparatively modest annual tuition fee at the most effective learning institution you will ever have the privilege of attending, a.k.a. the School of Hard Knocks.  Which is to say, some of the most valuable education you will ever get... provided you don't repeat the same experience.<p>As to the friendship, don't worry about it.  As long as you act in a fair, principled, and (importantly) clear-headed and non-impulsive manner, a (true) friendship can easily survive an experience like this.  They may even thank you (much later) for having seen the harsh light of reality far sooner than they did.<p>If in fact they're a true friend.  If they're not.. it can certainly feel very painful at first, when a supposed friend ""de-friends"" you, or acts in a destructive manner such that you feel forced to separate yourself from them.<p>But what it comes down to is that true friends just <i>won't</i> do this to you, or put you through dilemmas like this (not intentionally, or in any vindictive way, at least).<p>As to those turn out to be not such true friends, you were bound to find this out eventually (albeit perhaps through less cathartic means).  Think of it as not a loss, but an opening, a chance to regenerate and find newer and even better friends, and have much better experiences.<p>Lastly:  one thing I learned from having gone through an experience like this is that when going into business with ""friends"" we tend to let our defenses down, and expose ourselves to far greater financial (or emotional) harm than we do in regular business contexts, wherein even when we end up dealing with people really are basically out to screw us, we at least know how to cut our losses and not let it damage us so much, psychologically.  While your ""friends"" can actually end up damaging you much, much more even though you're supposedly all on the same, happy team.<p>It's kind of a simple thing, really... but knowing this going into your next ""friend""-based opportunity might help make for a much safer (and less soul-wrenching) ride.",1285891168

1745372,comment,1745205,1745205,0,0,private1,,,"Here's my story... Growing up I was always very active. I spent a lot of time outdoors and really enjoyed it. I was planning on becoming a paramedic. I'd grown up with computers and our family had the internet from about 1995.<p>At the age of 17 (I'm 24 now) two things began to happen, I started to play with design and HTML and I also developed a continuous headache... it started one day and I haven't had a moment without it since.<p>So how has the internet changed my life? Since I could no longer be active and couldn't pursue becoming a paramedic I spent more and more time designing websites and very quickly friends started paying me to create websites for them and I realised that I could do it for a living.<p>Now I've spent over five years working in the industry and have worked with people all over the world. I have worked for myself and for a number of creative agencies. I'm currently employed full-time and work in an office, but I'm not sure how much longer I can do that (bright fluorescent lights and the routine can be difficult at times) and so I'm either going to start looking for a startup/work from home job or go back to freelancing. All of this has been made possible because of the internet and I will continue to be able to work full-time because of it.",1285891110

Discipline and punishment are not the same thing and the fact that the word ""discipline"" has come to be a euphemism for punishment is just commentary on how rampantly common it is to punish kids rather then teach them how and why to do things.  Did I take things away from them sometimes?  Yes.  But only to remove the problem, not as a form of punishment.  And I did not threaten.

I'd also like to see the flip side of the receipt contain a guess for how the same tax amount would break down the following year based on current budget trends. That way you could see how the coming year is different from the current year. Complaining about NASA funding is one thing -- seeing that they only get 20 bucks while Social Security gets over a thousand? Puts the situation in much sharper contrast.<p>It's strange that the government works in such an arcane fashion.

(I have already done the obvious Google search, and I see a lot of claimed Einstein quotations in those words, but none with citations.) I ask, because although there is a whole book of Einstein quotations that has gone through several editions,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691120749/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691120749/</a><p>there are many Einstein quotations floating around the Internet that Einstein never said.<p>Einstein is on record as describing himself as an avid reader when he was a teen studying physics:<p>. . . I worked most of the time in the physical laboratory [at the Polytechnic Institute of Zürich], fascinated by the direct contact with experience. The balance of the time I used in the main in order to study at home the works of Kirchoff, Helmholtz, Hertz, etc. . . . In [physics], however, I soon learned to scent out that which was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside from everything else, from the multitude of things which clutter up the mind and divert it from the essential. The hitch in this was, of course, the fact that one had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect [upon me] that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year. In justice I must add, moreover, that in Switzerland we had to suffer far less under such coercion, which smothers every truly scientific impulse, than is the case in many another locality. There were altogether only two examinations; aside from these, one could just about do as one pleased. This was especially the case if one had a friend, as did I, who attended the lectures regularly and who worked over their content conscientiously. This gave one freedom in the choice of pursuits until a few months before the examination, a freedom which I enjoyed to a great extent and have gladly taken into the bargain the bad conscience connected with it as by far the lesser evil. It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty. To the contrary, I believe it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly.<p>""Autobiographical Notes,"" in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, Paul Schilpp, ed. (1951), pp. 17-19 © 1951 by the Library of Living Philosophers, Inc.<p>I know that citation is correct because I grew up with that book on the family bookshelf (as my late father studied the philosophy of science during his undergraduate education, just when the book was published). Reading can be good, Einstein thought, and maybe we should check the source of the quotation attributed to Einstein that discourages reading, to see exactly in what context it was said by Einstein, if it was said by him at all.",1285888570

Brussels knew it, like they knew about Greece doing the same thing(their economic pros are not stupid) but they short term benefited from that.<p>The ""Spanish miracle""(like Ireland) was created when billions of euros mainly from German and French savers came to Spain as loans. That made money to flow and prices to go up, anyone could buy a 60.000eur house(with a loan with 0%down) and sell it three months later as 90.000eur. That is 30.000eur of profit putting 0%, way more than working. Real state agencies grew like mushrooms after the rainfall.<p>I had friends that bought one house and later two with the profit they made with the first one!! thinking ""prices are never going to go down, they had never been down, we are going to be rich"".<p>That was good for sellers, good for politicians(they get taxes money proportional to the assets price), good for the banks that lended(they got paid), good to the construction workers and companies, good for the gov(less unemployment), so they tried to keep it. They all wanted to believe it was sustainable. It was not. Houses grew +400% but salaries only 17%.<p>Now our prime minister, Zapatero, thinks ""confidence"" is the most important thing for the economy to grow. He doesn't care about lying at all, he thinks he could fool all the people, all the time. Time will tell.",1285887898

The Internet doesn't need a one-stop shop as badly as ""real life"".<p>If that was THE website to go to for all of the services they offer, saving a couple seconds of typing might be advantageous. But they're not. Why should people switch? It's not particularly superior, as far as I can tell.<p>I applaud the effort, but will most likely never use it, and I doubt I'm alone.",1285887820

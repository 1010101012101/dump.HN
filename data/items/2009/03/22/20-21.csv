And, if the inconvenience is serious enough, the folks inconvenienced should be compensated.  (And, no, you don't get to bargain away the compensation by letting them off of something else that you wouldn't have found without the false positive.)<p>One benefit from compensating folks who are ""inconvenienced"" is that forces the relevant parties to do a better job in minimizing the total cost (which is proportional to the false positive rate multiplied by the cost of the inconvenience).<p>It's amazing how people's priorities depend on who's paying.",1237755454

Googling is hard, because there is so much marketing speak and bad reviews.<p>I have five main requirements:<p>1) Non-Hosted. While we will not host the site in house, I want the flexibility of choosing my own hosting provider.<p>2) Easy to Design for or Skin. We will probably end up paying someone for a professional looking UI, and would like this to be as easy as possible.<p>3) Good set of included modules. We don't want to roll our own search, shipping, payment gateways, etc.<p>4) Unix based.<p>5) Extendable.

527431,comment,527143,527143,0,0,g_lined,,,"Hi there, here are my thoughts:<p>Overall very good. I like the URL recognition. Here're my nitpicks:<p>General:\n* If we select the time zone, let us know whether you've taken into account DST.\n* I would prefer an e-mail-less signup process as I don't feel there's a need for it. AFAICS password retrieval is the only use and I can't see any evidence you've implemented that. Why do I have to give an email address if I don't even need it to log-in? For the free service, I think you should consider ditching the need for email addresses.\n* To-do, unless a branding decision, should not be capitalised unless grammar dictates otherwise. c.f. 'Add this To-do' button.\n* Consider moving the 'Add this To-do' button to the side of the to-do entry box.\n* Consider changing OS-native buttons to graphic/css buttons which fit in with the style/colouring of your site.<p>Ease of use:\n* Whenever I can see the to-do list, any typing whatever should go into the text box. You can do this with a javascript key bind. Why should I have to deal with clicks and focus when the only point of that page is to jot down items and tick them off?\n* Personally, I would advocate a log-in boxes on the front page as well as signup boxes, but I guess that's a design choice.\n* Why insist on alphanumeric only usernames particularly as this isn't a restriction for passwords? As a minimalist site, I shouldn't have to worry about what I type in, or be informed about the rules until I break them. The rules should be (as far as possible - and this is where the 'art' of design comes in) the same as I assume. Therefore, unless you have a technical issue, I suggest you allow as many punctuation and non latin characters as possible for both passwords and usernames. Only when I try and use one that's not possible to use due to technical limitations do you apologise and give me the rules.\n* It's difficult to delete many items. I don't mind hitting delete myself many times, but the delete button only comes up when you go over the main part of the to-do list meaning there's a lot of mouse movement to delete. If that's a design choice/attempt to stop accidental deletions, fair enough, otherwise it would be good to have it changed.<p>Bug: \n* If you manage to click/select the input box before the page has loaded you can end up with the wrong font and no 'Add this To-do' button. Additionally, pressing return doesn't actually add the to-do although it still brings up the 'Hang tight' box.<p>As I said, good site!",1237754049

(grin)<p>I'm at a similar loss here -- your post is about anti-admiration. The community here is hackers -- people who break the rules in order to advance society by building something of value. If we were interested in conforming we'd be ""IBM News"" or ""News for People Who Don't Disagree Much"" -- both of which would be soundly boring. We'd also be some place like reddit, where herd mentality rules a great bit more than here (but it's still quite prevalent here as well).<p>I've seen quite a bit of mindless adoration on here, not especially for pg, but for a lot of prominent internet writers. We all know them. Famous Joe the writer could post his grocery list and it'd have 15 points and a dozen comments by tomorrow morning. I guess it's just something about being a public figure. Steven King did a nice essay about this a while back but the link escapes me. Plus, as I've pointed out before, having a hero is a completely normal thing to do. When you're 16 or 17 its critical to have somebody to idolize that is worth a damn. Once you get older that need doesn't go away, but you're able to synthesize the best of multiple people, something that isn't so easy to do with limited experience.<p>I think you hit the problem dead on: if you're thinking ""gosh! It's PG! Why would I disagree with him?"" (or agree, for that matter) then you've already lost it. Praise is great, but just react normally and don't worry about who the person is. It's the value of the idea, not the value of the person.<p>There was an article on here a while back about the difference between people who really succeed and those who get stuck. The gist of it was that if you can't treat everybody, including people who can help you a great deal, as equals, then they'll never think of you as an equal either.<p>Good essay! Made me think.

Interestingness is a far better barometer of value than agreement. My tests for what I say/write: Is it interesting to the audience? The subsidiary test for what I write here: Will it make PG uncomfortable to hear? And my test for <i>that</i>: would it make me squirm in his position?<p>---<p>There's endless ways to talk about how much I admire PG and Eliezer Yudkowsky. I could describe running into Eliezer's ai_design.temp.html document back in '98 after searching a new search engine called 'Google' for 'copycat eurisko sources' after reading Douglas Hofstadter's book about his cool AI projects, and my obsession with AI for the next 3 years. I could talk about the sense of epiphany of reading 'Why nerds are unpopular' and 'the age of the essay', and then PG's essays on startups that gradually opened up to a struggling, mediocre grad student the third career option besides academia and bigco research lab, with the grand culmination of 'How to do what you love'. When I met PG I felt like how I imagine teenagers felt in front of the Beatles (""OMG, I can't believe it.. it's really PG.. quick say something.. wait don't say something stupid.."")<p>How I feel about these guys is more than admiration. It's a sense of identification intertwined with the time in my life I ran into them, and the influence they had (<a href=""http://akkartik.name/blog/2009-03-22-20-03-26-soc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/blog/2009-03-22-20-03-26-soc</a>). It's not about how good they are, or whether there are better writers out there, or whether they can kick Chuck Norris's butt; it's about the vivid memories of reading specific essays.<p>I could say all these things, and even rationalize to myself at the time that they were interesting, or said in interesting ways. They may even be interesting to say once. But this is a community, and there's a daily routine, and the emphasis is on the trajectory rather than on individual comments. It would be <i>super</i> boring to find endless ways to talk about how much I admire PG and Eliezer. Or to read everybody else's, I fear, far too similar stories.<p>---<p>I like to praise the people I admire in useful ways. Like if I can focus on something they said and add more evidence. Or contrast a point with what somebody else said. Or respond to a commenter who seemed to miss the point. I admire the content of their writings, and the form. A great form of praise is by showing I understood, at a deep level, what they were trying to say. An even better one is to try to write like they do.<p>(OMG, I really hope I didn't make them squirm. I hope PG didn't think this was lame. But I can say this once. But I hope I'm not embarrassed next time I meet PG. Will I meet PG soon?..)",1237753342

If you have a finite set of people (and I bet in a short time frame you can make that assumption), then in the WORST case you have to do n*(n+1)/2 matches. Let&#x27;s say it takes 1 hr to run a date, then we can match 10 people in 55 hrs in the worst case.<p>Now, try matching 10 people using these websites. Enter the texting game and no proper filtering (by looks, age, location, etc.). It will take X time my worst case scenario to maybe match half of the population.<p>Point is: somebody should make a system that clusters people and randomly assigns them to dates. Without any prior texting that is. Which, by the way, would simulate the way people met until 20 years ago more or less.",1389787192

The Federal Circuit&#x27;s holding</i> [in <i>Soverain</i>]  <i>by a 3-judge panel</i> had <i>been remarkable and had shocked patent lawyers generally in that the parties before the court</i> had not even raised <i>the issue on appeal as a ground for invalidating the jury&#x27;s verdict below. The court raised the issue on its own, concluded that the patent was obvious and invalid, and gave judgment for Newegg in spite of the fact that the jury at the trial court level had found that Newegg infringed.</i> (Emphasis in original.)<p>George, it&#x27;s not at all apparent that in <i>Soverain</i> the Federal Circuit raised and decided the obviousness issue <i>sua sponte</i>, that is, on its own.  The court&#x27;s opinion [1] expressly says, at page 5:  <i>&quot;Newegg argues that it was wrongfully deprived of a jury determination of the question of obviousness, pointing to the extensive testimony on this issue at trial.&quot;</i><p>(Patent lawyers really <i>would</i> have been shocked if Newegg had not raised the obviousness issue on appeal.)<p>In its <i>Soverain</i> opinion, the Federal Circuit had previously explained, at page 4, that the trial judge, in the Eastern District of Texas, had (in essence) directed the jury not to consider the obviousness issue, because the trial judge had decided on his own that Newegg&#x27;s evidence wasn&#x27;t enough to allow a reasonable jury to invalidate the patent.    The Federal Circuit thought otherwise.<p>The appeals court didn&#x27;t send the case back down to the trial judge for reconsideration; instead, it decided the obviousness issue on its own.  That&#x27;s because under existing precedent, the <i>ultimate</i> decision on obviousness is reserved initially for the trial judge as a so-called question of law, and the trial judge&#x27;s decision is subject to complete plenary scrutiny, known as &quot;de novo&quot; review, by the appeals court (and, theoretically, by the Supreme Court of the United States). (See pages 5-6.)<p>So, under existing precedent, it&#x27;s actually quite <i>un</i>remarkable for the Federal Circuit to reverse a trial court on the issue of obviousness.  (Usually, though, the outcome goes the other way:  It seems more typical for a trial judge initially to conclude that a patent claim is <i>in</i>valid for obviousness, after which the Federal Circuit will reverse and render judgment that the patent claim was not proved invalid.)<p>As to your assertion that the Federal Circuit decision &quot;had shocked patent lawyers generally&quot;:  I didn&#x27;t remember that to be the case, so I did a quick Google search. One well-known patent-law blogger -- who if I remember correctly is very pro-patent -- wrote a couple of extensive analyses of the Federal Circuit decision and its subsequent decision on rehearing [2][3]. This blogger has strong views that the Federal Circuit shouldn&#x27;t engage in <i>de novo</i> review of obviousness [2].  He accused the Federal Circuit of having, in <i>Soverain</i>, &quot;made findings of fact as if they were the trial court and decided the case on issues not argued by either party&quot; [2].  That accusation, though, seems to me to be unsupported hyperbole, quite contrary to what the Federal Circuit actually wrote.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/2011-1009.Opinion.1-17-2013.1.PD"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/...</a><p>[2] <a href""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/01/13/supreme-court-refuses-soverain-bank-v-newegg/id=47392"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/01/13/supreme-court-refuses-s...</a><p>[3] <a href""http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/09/04/is-soverain-software-v-newegg-supreme-court-bound/id=44936"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/09/04/is-soverain-software-v-...</a>",1389784252

There are 1597 laptops on newegg right now, 9 have high end A10s, and they are all huge.<p>If they die shrunk Thuban, I would buy it. If they put more cores on Kaveri, I would buy that. If someone would put an A10 in a laptop that wasn&#x27;t a huge, cheap, POS, I might even buy that. But so far they won&#x27;t.<p>So who is this for?<p>Mobile might be appealing if we care more about gaming than work or battery life, but at this point it&#x27;s not clear how available it will be. As a programmer, I like the idea of unified memory but that&#x27;s not a selling point for customers. A friend of mine has a laptop with a recent APU, and she just figured out that it&#x27;s too slow for minecraft. Telling her about hUMA did not make the sad face go away, true story.<p>The only place APUs looks good is for desktop gamers who don&#x27;t have a desktop already, and can&#x27;t afford better, even by a few measly bucks. I&#x27;m not even sure that they wouldn&#x27;t be better off with a Haswell Pentium and and $50 GPU for the same price, but Anandtech won&#x27;t tell us...<p>Did no one else notice that Anandtech&#x27;s review is posted in the site&#x27;s &quot;AMD Center&quot;, and is &quot;presented by AMD&quot;? I call shenanigans. And people in this thread are calling Anandtech one of the best hardware sites on the the net... Now I&#x27;m depressed.",1389783675

Suppose that it takes $100k/year to keep an H1B holder from jumping ship.  Add that to the $100k fee and that employee costs the original employer $200k.  Since the agreed-on market rate for that job was $120k, the original employer isn't going to pay $100k year.  Instead, they'll avoid the risk of losing the $100k fee and hire locally.<p>That's why the fee will discourage H1Bs for low-wage jobs.<p>If the fee is paid by all employers (and presumably refunded when an H1B jumps ship), there's no poaching bonus so every employer is essentially the first employer.",1262132270

Ultimately the Netflix competition isn't for a recommendation engine, it's a prediction engine. They use that prediction engine to produce recommendations, but that's a separate phase. The top N predicted ratings != the best N things to recommend at this moment, though obviously it's useful to know predicted ratings for movies if you're writing a recommender.<p>A recommendation engine should not just recommend the highest predicted rated apps given that the user downloads the app. As an extremely simple example, even if you habitually rate games much higher than other apps, it shouldn't recommend you 100% games. You probably want to see other things sometimes too.

How would a law in the States stop someone from Iran to bully someone in a forum.</i><p>The fact the internet is internation makes it difficult, not impossible for the Internet to be policed.<p>First, remember that even though the internet makes international dealings trivially easy, much of the interaction (most perhaps?) takes place entirely within the borders of one country.  This makes it easily subject to that country's laws.<p>Further, even when it is truly international there are still ways of enforcing at least a large subset of laws through international courts, or by suing in a court with jurisdiction over the defendant, or in some major cases through extradition.<p>And that is what can be done right now.  With time and work, international governing bodies and more detailed treaties can be written to ease those legal dealings.  (What form those can or should take is well beyond the current scope, but it is safe to say they are possible and even likely.)<p>(edited to fix grammar)",1262131261

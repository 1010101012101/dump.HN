No one knows what anything is worth, but a company that remains in reasonably good esteem can ensure that the valuation doesn't go down, even if it ""should"" based on fundamentals. Terms can get worse and funding may become harder to get, but down rounds can be prevented unless something really bad is happening.<p>On the stock market, where the valuation process is nearly continuous, almost 50 percent of days are down days (the daily drift is tiny in comparison to the standard deviation).<p>What has happened is that the Facebook stock has gone from an environment with artificial support to one without it.

My field is career development and so I work a lot with people during their job search, and one of the first things I ask is ""what happens when someone googles you?"" Then I'll explain the value of having your own domain. I understood when older workers would say they didn't understand how to set it up, or were confused, etc so I often walk them through it.<p>Then I went back and spoke at my college (I'm 42). I figured, well, these 21 year old internet whiz kids will certainly have this figured out. Nope. The number of people I met that owned their domain was about the same... consistently about 1-2 out of every 10 people I ask.<p>So in tech geek/lean startup mode, I got frustrated with explaining it to people over and over, so I purchased a domain, bought a theme for $8, used my friend Jayme as a guinea pig, and in 1 weekend recorded a how-to video and built a site so I didn't have to explain it over and over. It's called GetYourNameToday.com.<p>Look, I realize there's no way for me to not make this comment look spammy, and yes, in full disclosure there is a GoDaddy affiliate link on there (which I note in both the video and on each page), but I figured if it doesn't cost the person anything more, I am genuinely helping them out, and I can get a little something for my effort, why not.<p>I'm very transparent with who I am on the site, link to my career development/new media blog to show that it is in sync with what I do for a living, and even tackle questions such as WHY to register your name and what to do if you have a basic name that isn't available. I'm with you... seems like there are very few reasons why someone wouldn't see the benefits of securing their name for the ""investment"" of $10.<p>Would love to hear your feedback on the site and if you would have positioned it any differently or what I could do to improve it.

Instead of green technology, we see Zynga employing people who work full-time trying to exploit the same class of people that were targeted by the dreaded telemarketers of 10 years ago.<p>The late-90s bubble was frothier, with all the talk of a recession-proof ""New Economy"" (oddly, most people now long for the Old one) and the massively overvalued technology stocks.

You can't have one font that looks exactly the same in all media, all antialiasing algorithms, and all sizes and resolutions.<p>Most people don't even notice, but serious type designers care about these subtle differences. Besides, antialiasing alone won't solve this problem as long as screens vary greatly in pixels per inch.

But the thing is, pretty much every linguist in the world would disagree with the notion. The connotations of words are constantly shifting  there is ample evidence of this throughout the history of languages.<p>I applaud you for thinking about this sort of thing and speaking out about it, but in this particular case I think you're tilting at windmills.<p>Even if we accepted this absolutist stance where words' meanings do not change no matter what the common perception or intent of the speaker might be, it still wouldn't be offensive to women. If the word's connotation is immutable, then it does not refer to human women at all, but to dogs, and thus human men have just as much right to the word as human women do. But surely you'd agree the word has acquired new connotations since then, contrary to your claim above.<p>There might have been some point in history at which your stance was the right one, but if there was, I think that time is long gone. I don't know if you're just that old or if your regional dialect is odd in this regard, but I'm pretty sure the verb ""bitch"" is not gendered in most people's mental lexicons today. Because it is not particularly associated with them, it does not actually do any harm to women as a group if you use it.<p>(Note that all this is distinct from the noun ""bitch,"" which is applied to men but is still has gendered associations.

Dr. Zimmat has been using the new Watson 2nd series in an attempt to untangle chaos theory to find the ultimate causes of major weather events, in the hopes of finding humanly affectable actions that could help to dampen the ever increasing number of Hurricanes.<p>""I'm afraid I can't release the name of the individual,"" Dr. Zimmat explained, ""however by using the network of cameras in downtown London and correlating with the time our models show an unusual movement of air, we can with 90%+ certainty say that a gentleman's sneeze in the wrong direction is ultimately to blame"".<p>Investigators for London Yard remain mute on whether any action is being taken, while inside sources state that it would be hard to prove anything more than unintentional manslaughter. US investigators, however, are working on a theory that members of Al Quaida may have planted a mole in London to execute the sneeze.<p>1/2 :-)",1337972638

I just don't think that live tracking of legislation is the way to do it, and I think that it has dangerous pitfalls.<p>> If you think lawyers understand the law, well, you're a bit naive.<p>I think they understand the principles on which the law is grounded. Basically, either law school is useful or it isn't. By most accounts, law school is 3 years of intense study, at the end of which you're qualified to...use LexisNexis. Either those 3 years are a waste, or they learn something that takes roughly that long to learn.<p>Of course some laymen can achieve that knowledge, and some in less than 3 years, much like people can learn to be good programmers without setting foot in a classroom. But that's an exception, and we can't predicate the functioning of society on exceptions.<p>> That's like saying a baby is useless because it can't hold on to a job. Well, yeah. If you kill the baby, it never will.<p>That's a fair point. And part of the beauty of the baby is that you don't know what it will grow up to do. But every parent has a dream for their child; my argument is that the dream expressed is misguided.<p>> This is very quaint, and honestly, I'm a big fan of the principles on which this nation was founded ... but this is merely one of those principles.<p>I know, it is quaint. But I don't really see a good alternative, because I don't trust our ability (yes, mine included) to figure out who to trust based on crafted messages, or selected video clips.<p>As I said, your point about the baby is well taken. This can definitely be a building blockbut why don't we think about a building block to what?<p>As a thought, how about running analyses on laws vs. desired outcomes vs. predicated outcomes. Analyses run using open-source codeand hopefully eventually with predictive power. I think something like that might be very useful, and would definitely rely on this repository; especially if someone has the resources and time to artificially create it going back several decades.",1337972524

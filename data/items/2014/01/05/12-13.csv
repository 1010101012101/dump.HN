7015500,comment,7012151,7014830,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"As I said, Justice Breyer&#x27;s paper was quite interesting.  It turns out that, at least at the time he wrote it, textbooks (I don&#x27;t recall if he distinguished between collegiate and primary/secondary, more later), and technical books, constituted a very large portion of the publishing market and a disproportionate portion of the profits.<p>In the primary/secondary school market, you have a number of issues at play.  There&#x27;s the separation of buyer (a school district or state board  official usually) and the payer (generally taxpayers at large, sometimes students.  This creates a similar severing of the normal roles of decisionmaker and payor to that found in healthcare (a patient requests service, the insurance carrier pays for it) or the military (a purchasing officer approves the purchase, taxpayers pay).  There&#x27;s also a separation between the agent and _user_, which also shows up in a number of other contexts (corporate purchasing would be a typical example).<p>The other is that there are a number of markets which have an undue influence on the broader textbook industry.  Large states such as California, Texas, and New York represent millions of students, but of these, Texas makes <i>statewide</i> purchasing decisions on what books to buy.  The reason the building from which Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK was called the Texas school book depository is because it was the <i>Texas School Book Depository</i>, leased at the time by a company which did a large part of the order fulfillment for the state of Texas.  So purchase decisions by Texas influence the economics of publishing to the extent of governing what books may be available elsewhere.  The politicization of this in particular as regards creationists trying to beat down evolution has impacts throughout the United States.",1388923735

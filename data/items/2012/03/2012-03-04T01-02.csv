IF (and it isn't clear from my reading) the company didn't have signed papers with your first coinvestor, they are well within rights to drop the investor. But you have a responsibility to not abuse the trust the coinvestor gave you.

I'm pretty happy with where I am now (some changes to the code have happened, it you actually want to see the current situation you need to check out the kernel mailing list post), but finding the number of bytes in the final mask bothers me.<p>Using an explicit loop is out - the branch mispredicts kill it. And while at least modern Intel CPU's do quite well with just using the bit scan instructions (""bsf"") to find where the first NUL or '/' was in the word, that sucks on some older CPU's.<p>So I came up with the following trick to count the number of bytes set in the byte mask:<p><pre><code>  /* Low bits set in each byte we used as a mask */
  mask &= ONEBYTES;
  /* Add up ""mask + (mask<<8) + (mask<<16) +... "":
  same as a multiply */
  mask *= ONEBYTES;
  /* High byte now contains count of bits set */
  len += mask >> 8*(sizeof(unsigned long)-1);
</code></pre>
and I'm wondering if anybody can come up with something that avoids the need for that multiply (and again - conditionals don't work, the mispredict costs kill you).<p>Because that multiply isn't free either.""<p>EDIT: Thanks for the tips, I'm new here",1330825379

The safety tech on a commonly equipped Mercedes today is what you'll see on all cars in 5-10 years. Things like active blind spot assist -- If there's a car in my blindspot and I try to change lanes into it, the car will use the brakes on the leading side of the car to nudge me back into my lane. And active lane keeping assist -- it applies that same tech to prevent me going left of center if it thinks I'm drifting and not doing it intentionally. Attention assist -- it tracks my driving style and engagement and alerts me if I'm drifting off. Not to mention, just a lot of smart tech: Apply the brakes ever so slightly when it's raining to keep them dry. Seatbelt pretensioner's. And structural things -- an extra firewall in the engine compartment. More, stronger clasps on the hood. Many of these features are found on other makes.

If however your only option is the callback, then you have no way to work around its overhead.<p>Additionally, callbacks have the same amount of overhead but it's not constant because you have to create a side-channel for the state management.  That means, instead of a simpler stack for keeping the state, you have to have a periodic stack + a structure or object for all the state even when the callback isn't active.",1330823766

And the academic model, of applications for grant funding works quite well for just these sort of advancements, at least in other fields. Somebody who has the money and time to put together a grant program targeting improvements in both programming languages and, perhaps more importantly, real world user experiments in the design of programming languages, could really make a difference.  There is no inherent reason that that the decades for useful feature implementation couldn't be reduced significantly, given a moderate source of funding, a good journal community, and better research methodologies.",1330823721

3661617,comment,3660769,3660769,2,0,jlawer,,,"The whole concept of not trusting the applications you run is actually fairly recent I would argue less then the past decade.<p>Early security was about not trusting other people, and thus passwords & authentication was developed. Then with the rise of closed source off the shelf apps and viruses came anti-virus software. But this was protecting you against the distribution channel. As most malware at the time was purely malware (although potentially infecting useful software).<p>The problem is now we have malware that is also the software your wanting to run. While Sandboxing and such have been Computer Science concepts for decades (so has pretty much everything ""new"") its only now becoming important enough to consumers & business that it is being used. The initial implementations are quite poor because they have to be backwards compatible with codebases that are often decades old (Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, etc).<p>Security is really hard to do well, and almost impossible in a completely backwards compatible way. iOS and Android will be the first platforms who are able to fix this because they are less burdened by the weight of legacy software. In a walled garden it is quiet easy to break compatibility and demand a rebuild, as long as you don't piss the developers off too much and make sure the change isn't TOO difficult you will generally get it done with a bit of complaints.",1330823584

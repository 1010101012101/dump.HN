While the author did use the words &quot;mental illness,&quot; I felt he was mostly talking about general mental well-being (i.e. how to avoid needing the doctor). To extend your analogy, you don&#x27;t need to go to the doctor to eat well and exercise. You are correct, however, that a person should seek help if something does break. Further, for some people, it might be beneficial to seek assistance (such as therapy) before things break. To finish murdering the analogy, a nutritionist or personal trainer is probably not necessary to eat well or exercise, but they may be extremely valuable to some people.",1452704390

I need an experience letter from that employer for my immigration process. The letter is supposed to document tasks performed and that I really was hired as a software developer and not as a janitor.<p>I contacted the manager there and he pointed me to HR. The HR then gave me a generic employment verification letter (which does not have job duties). They said that I should ask my manager for a letter with job duties and that they have no policy against writing such a letter.<p>When I contacted my manager again, he became unresponsive. No reply to emails or phone calls.

They are wholly different ways to interact with information, each better suited for different tasks.<p>I&#x27;m 28 years old, and I buy all my books in print form. There is something about learning from a physical object (with volume, texture, scent) that makes things &quot;click&quot; better. I remember &quot;where&quot;, within some textbook I read half a decade ago, some topic is explained. A literal, physical &quot;where&quot;: a page, somewhere in the middle of a physical stack of bound paper, which I can touch and feel; I might event remember where I was when I studied the subject; maybe I jotted some note on the margin, maybe I spilled tea on the pages before, giving that &quot;where&quot; its own unique texture and colour, all of which my brain will forever associate with that information. Digital can&#x27;t do any of that.<p>There is nothing left to improve about the physical book.<p>Of course, if my physical book confuses me, because perhaps it was written by a certain man named Spivak, who does not like to explain what happens in between those little &quot;=&quot; symbols, I can&#x27;t press on anything and expect it to expand magically and reveal more detail. It&#x27;s at this point that I will turn to my laptop, and search for more information, maybe even ask a stranger half a world away, or watch an interactive video. My copy of &quot;Calculus on Manifolds&quot; can&#x27;t do any of that.<p>I also still find that the best way to solve a problem (even a programming problem), is on pen and paper. Physically jotting down an idea beats pressing buttons while staring at an obnoxious, headache-inducing glowing screen any time (which I try to avoid as much as possible, even as a software developer). To me flipping still beats searching and clicking, and pen and paper still beat Google calendar, or whatever todo-app-of-the-week.<p>The best technology is invisible and gets out of the way.

However: the term &quot;technical debt&quot; is not for engineer-to-engineer communication: it is for communicating to management and other non-technical actors - and in that role the term perfectly suits its purpose.<p>To understand why, let&#x27;s consider a normal interaction with a corporate legal team.  The content team submits some copy to the legal team for approval and the legal team needs to communicate to the content team that they can&#x27;t make the claim they are trying to make about the product.  Now, it&#x27;s more true in the technical sense for legal to say things like &quot;Section 3 paragraph 7 of the Fair Sales Act states that Consumer Entities as defined in Section 1 Paragraph 3 may not represent their products in such a way as to potentially mislead a Purchaser as defined in Section 2 paragaph 9. Furthermore this issue has been thoroughly litigated at both the federal appellate and Supreme Court levels which have reinforced those interpretations unfavorable to the aforementioned Consumer Entity.&quot; But that wouldn&#x27;t be great for either department.  It&#x27;s more useful for Legal to just say &quot;You can&#x27;t claim that - we&#x27;ll get sued.&quot; In a similar way, it&#x27;s more useful as a software engineer to just say &quot;that decision will add to our technical debt&quot; than to try and discuss the minutiae of how a certain bad architecture decision will make the system &quot;resistant to change&quot;.

10895652,comment,10893877,10894918,0,0,jerrytsai,,,"I second this. There&#x27;s little (...or insufficient) reason to believe some numbers come up more often, so you assume any set of numbers may come up. Then any number combination may come up, so you may as well pick the number combinations which fewer people pick. At least one study has shown that numbers below 30 are picked more often than those above 30. So by picking numbers above 30 you increase the chance you do NOT split the jackpot if you win.<p>From an expected value perspective, however, lotteries are generally money LOSERS. Even at the estimated $1.5 billion for this Wednesday&#x27;s drawing, the expected value of purchasing a ticket is NEGATIVE.<p>Here&#x27;s why: the $1.5 billion is paid as an annuity-- the reported lump sum (present value) payment would be $930 million. Depending on your tax situation, if you live in the USA, you would lose about 40% of that to federal taxes, leaving you with about $558 million. In that it costs you $2 to purchase one number and the odds are 292 million to 1, you would need the take-home jackpot to be 2 times $292 million, or $584 million dollars before the expected value to be zero. (And this assumes a world in which jackpots cannot be split! And that you have no taxes beyond the federal tax!)<p>So the best play really is to NOT PLAY. From an expected value perspective, it probably would make sense to play when the jackpot is over $2 billion. It would depend on the frequency distribution of split jackpots.<p>So IF you&#x27;re going to play, then you should try to minimize the chance you win a share of a split jackpot.

Technical debt is not about evaluating the value of a line of code or program, but about it&#x27;s potential maintenance cost.<p>I work at a large organization that maintains over 300+ modules of code and custom software programs, varying in size from a thousand lines of code to massive ones. Any one of which can be sold at any time, and all of which is supported in some fashion or another, and all of which should be able to work together.<p>You need some sort of metric to see where to invest ones time. If you don&#x27;t manage the technical debt, everyone spends all their time doing tech support.<p>So, how the helpful concept of technical debt is evaluating where to put effort into improving the code base, and evaluating potential support cost of adding more modules?

In my experience there&#x27;s a huge difference in the efficiency of dating sites where everybody can sign up for free (even if they need to pay up later to actually get in touch with someone), and dating sites that only allow paying members.<p>When I was still dating online I&#x27;ve used multiple different sites, and the experience was always perfectly aligned with the the article (which by the way was very enjoyable to read, mostly because it was so recognizable, but also because it&#x27;s well-written and witty).<p>That was, until I decided to sign up for a paid-members-only online dating site. All of a sudden all the profiles seemed so much more truthful and realistic. Women would actually respond to my messages, if only to politely let me know they were not interested. I would regularly receive unsolicited messages from women, often because they liked things about my profile text, which almost never happened on the free sites even though I used the exact same text. Within less than a year I met my current girlfriend who I&#x27;ve been with for 2 years now, and surprise: like many of the other women on that site she&#x27;s a perfectly normal person who didn&#x27;t feel the need to stuff and fluff her online profile like everyone seems to do on &#x27;free&#x27; online dating services.<p>Moral of the story: there&#x27;s plenty of opportunity to find someone online, if you look in the right places. Don&#x27;t expect to have a lot of success on the free websites though, there&#x27;s so much noise in the profiles on these sites that the whole concept of writing something about yourself and sending messages falls apart. Half of the profiles on these sites are fake or abandoned anyway.",1452702487

I relate this idea to the fact that in logical reasoning, all true statements are, once proved, held to be simultaneously true. That is, given if A then B, with A being true, we don&#x27;t hold B to be true &#x27;after&#x27; A, but to have been always true, given A.<p>In the pirate problem, limiting ourselves to three pirates to shorten my explanation, we end up with the split being: 99 to C, 0 to D, 1 to E. This is because we assume that if only D and E were left, D would keep 100 to himself. Now given that distribution (99,0,1), D should now change his hypothetical proposal to (0,98,2). If we assume that C is not a &#x27;non-causality&#x27; believer, but both D and E to be, then E would vote no to (99,0,1) and D would do the (0,98,2) split. You may argue that D could then do a (0,100,0) split, but that&#x27;s not how a non-causality believer MUST act, because he knows that to get to that point, he must know thet E can logically know that he will do this split. This can be justified by arguing that when a pirates survives, he will enter such gold-splitting game later on. But my argument is subtler than this and doesn&#x27;t require it. It basically become this: all such pirates, posited to be perfectly logical, are interchangeable. Thus they must all reason in the same fashion. Thus, my argument is that <i>true</i> pure logical minds see that the true way to maximize their gold profit is to hold a world view that maximize their profit, even if causality is discarded. Thus both D and E know that tehy can maximize their profit by discarding their belief in causality. That is how D ends up proposing (0,98,2) and E accepts it.<p>Of course, I ended up there by assuming C was not a believer, but given my argument, C must also be ready to throw causality out of the window, otherwise he will end up dead. I believe my argument ends up splitting (49,51,0), but I&#x27;m not sure. Once causality is throw out, it&#x27;s hard to tell, but intuitively, with three pirates, those voting must be given almost equal gold and the remaining pirates must not have a majority.",1452702139

When you talk about not being attracted to the people who talk to you or are in your age range, are you going purely by looks? Maybe if you met up with them and talked over coffee or whatever you might start to develop attraction. It&#x27;s entirely your prerogative if you want physical looks to limit your dating pool, but just seems like an unnecessary restriction to me.<p>Another plus of meeting up with potential dates is you do get to make conversation. Having a back-and-forth Q&A won&#x27;t help you get to know someone. You get to learn facts about them, but you won&#x27;t learn if this person is fun in conversation, if they can keep up with you or you can keep up with them, if you&#x27;ll see them as an interesting conversation partner or boring, etc. I think at the messaging stage it&#x27;s about trying to establish friendliness and familiarity, and of course of establishing basic facts about this person (although if that person was a dog, I would most definitely want to meet the dog!), with the goal of setting a meeting time. The face-to-face meeting is where you try to find compatibility. The face-to-face meeting will also let you confirm facts about their profile (bots can&#x27;t meet in real life, and if a dog was chatting with you I would most definitely want to meet them!).",1452701980

You see people hacking a bugfix in one day on the F1 site, but this fix will not survive. Some shops restore from their backups nightly, you will certainly face a lot of meetings and reports to get your one-line fix back into production. Even on R&D problems, which mostly describes F1.<p>This case reported here was on the assembly line, there are different rules.<p>If a strange misproduction happens you certainly want to be able to evaluate the riscs properly. The analogy is a Heisenbug in the production compiler. How often does it happen, how expensive is the problem, how expensive is the fix. There&#x27;s not one car on the risc, there&#x27;s the whole line in question. The new robot? The SW or the HW? Wrong measurement, wrong planning, broken sensor, broken motor? Or a real Heisenbug, which appears in HW much more often than in SW. Magneto/electric cabling problem. Or sometimes even light. The cable guy bending an overlong fibre cable <30cm radius. A fibre with a bad cut at one end causing all sorts of crazy effects, and crazy hackish fixes. Missing CAN terminators (analogy to missing SCSI terminators on harddrive chains) in certain F1 cars. It might work, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to sit in this thing. This new 140.000 rpm high-speed rotor behind my back, making the driver uncomfortable, who is starting making bad mistakes out of fear, and rather pulls this thing out. Relations to completely crazy effects from outside, such as a cleaning lady turning on a bad fan, causing a jitter or spike, having some effects elsewhere. A bug, a real bug, in the system, esp. in Asia or Australia.<p>I see not much differences from SW and HW engineering. \nBut the biggest difference I know about is the methology.<p>Agile in car manifacturing or HW engineering at all only happens at Toyota, nowhere else. Properly planned waterfall, with excellent and high powered middle management is the norm.\nIf in Asia, Europe or the US.<p>There do exist some very small HW shops, with 1-4 engineers and 2 managers/sales people, and 2 support. There the development is of course engineering driven. Or there are some exceptions, such as Toyota or VW with crazy assembly optimizations, or e.g. Honda where their boss is one of the best engineers (they are lucky). But they eventually they ran out of luck with their funding and had to sell their very best test site, which was then taken over Daimler. That&#x27;s why their are leading the F1 currently.<p>Another difference is proper training. These good engineering companies train their people a lot. Maybe 10x more than in normal SW engineering.",1452701861

When I say jump you better reply how high within 15 seconds, and you are not in a social position to ask me to jump.  You can also signal primate dominance WRT making sure everyone knows you&#x27;re not feeling the need to put on a show of being necessary because you&#x27;re a hero, because your position is otherwise so secure you don&#x27;t need to pose to protect your dominance.<p>Its possible to brag or enforce dominance about management skill.  A skilled manager can get hit by a truck and finely crafted systems and procedures will work for days, weeks, months.  An incompetent manager is perpetually running around like a chicken with head cut off in continuous hero saves the day mode, which looks impressive to people who don&#x27;t understand it signals gross incompetence.  So you can stealthily brag about your management power level by very loudly claiming you don&#x27;t have to be a superhero because unlike the chicken with their head cut off competitors, you actually know how to manage and lead.<p>Another primate dominance interpretation is level based, not skill or power based.  Low level people have low level responsibilities, like instantaneously responding to absolutely everyone.  Higher level people respond to higher level problems, which tend to both evolve and be fixed much more slowly.  So a line employee or team lead needs to be a whipped slave, but a CEO who needs to micromanage is a failed CEO, that CEO should be thinking about next years overall strategy, not ultra short term like how to do a customer service reps job for them.

It seems to be a natural answer to the growing problem - meeting people in general, and potential romantic partners in particular, gets an order of magnitude harder when you finish education. For most people, it&#x27;s suddenly 9-10h/day spent at work (8h + commute), and it&#x27;s hard to maintain a social life when you&#x27;re both a) tired every evening, and b) required to be in good shape the next morning. Of course, many deal with it perfectly fine. Many deal only sort-of, which is why workplace romance is so common even though employers try to fight it as much as possible. But then there&#x27;s a large group that simply can&#x27;t find the right opportunities. On-line dating is great for those. And it works at least sometimes - I personally know of people who met and got married through one site.<p>That said, I&#x27;m totally not surprised by your observation about Facebook events. It&#x27;s more <i>natural</i> to meet people like that, without prior obligations. People tend to be more open, and conversations more genuine. Especially if this is a topical event, you automatically have people pre-selected for interest compatibility. Just like money can be detrimental to the projects of passion, on-line dating seems like &quot;trying too hard&quot;, compared to casual meetup. I tried using a dating service once, and such dates actually felt to me more like a business transaction than a meeting of strangers. But then again, I&#x27;m shy, I prefer going the roundabout way :).<p>And to add N=1 story, my success in finding a potential future friend or romantic partner tends to be inversely proportional to how much I try, and a direct function of number of events and public appearances I make. I&#x27;m thankful for services like Facebook and Meetup, which let you know about interesting events in the area without having you spend a ton of time on finding them.",1452701450

Organizations should try to hire developers that care about what they build and understand that, as an implied part of the nature of the job, your phone may ring at some unknown time because of an issue. In operations it is certainly implied that you will likely be the first one notified of production issues and you will most likely be the first to know which developer(s) need to be contacted. I am certainly not advocating for a developer to throw their hands up and say &quot;not my problem, I&#x27;m not on call&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s an ops issue.&quot; Those would be very junior or childish reactions and certainly not the qualities of a senior developer.<p>What my post was getting at more of an observation I have  made during interviews where teams had on-call rotations for developers. When I ask &quot;how often does your phone ring during your time on-call&quot; I would get answers that hinted at a deeper issue. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t always that way, maybe the on-call rotation started with the purest of intentions like you have highlighted, but somewhere along the line management saw that as an opportunity to take shortcuts with testing and quality. So, am I saying that if a company were to make me an excellent offer, but required on-call rotations are they automatically ruled out? No. I am, however, going to be asking some very pointed questions and probing that arrangement quite a bit.",1452701405

With real financial debt one knows immediately the exact dollar amount, the interest rate, the payment terms and so forth.  There is usually no ambiguity or judgment.  In contrast, technical debt is based on theories about software development and uncertain predictions about future changes to the software. As the old saying goes: &quot;prediction is hard, especially about the future.&quot;<p>As a business, if I buy a computer on a company credit card, I know immediately that I owe $1200.00 at 23 percent interest per year.  In contrast, if I develop a piece of software and decide to use global variables to speed up development, I may immediately gain a mythical man-month in development time BUT I have no idea how much it may slow me down in the future if at all.  Sometimes global variables are the way to go and development will be consistently faster for the entire lifetime of the software compared to using local variables.  This tends to happen, not surprisingly, when the data in the global variables needs to be used widely throughout the program.",1452701028

In my experience, it&#x27;s in the employer&#x27;s best interest to hire good people, and it&#x27;s not in their best interest to be candid with you. Furthermore, even if I as an interviewer worked for a shitty company, it&#x27;s still in my best interest to hire good people so that the company becomes less shitty over time. Therefore, there are very few questions you can ask that will give you a good insight as to whether a position is a dead-end job (whatever that means to you) or not. I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, but I&#x27;m also going to spin it in the most positive light I can to entice you to join my team.<p>At my last interview, I had a lot of success pretending that I was the one interviewing 5 people rather than being interviewed by those people. I asked a lot of questions, tried to get a sense of their day to day. It turned the interview into a bit more of a dialogue and less of an interrogation, and I think I got to see a bit more about how those people worked and what they thought during their time with me. I asked them a lot of the same questions I ask candidates when I&#x27;m interviewing them.<p>It worked pretty well. Got an offer. Wound up declining, because I sensed it wasn&#x27;t a role I wanted, but I don&#x27;t think any particular question gave me that impression.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think you can really find out in an interview.

What troubles many Chinese about the Falun Gong and American society is the instability and inherent threats that it causes to Chinese society, by way of potential destabilization of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s central authoritarian rule.  What troubles Americans and more pluralistic societies is that they believe that only through a pluralistic, representative society can human rights abuses be brought to the forefront and eliminated. What the thought is, while America has many problems and human rights abuses, China is likely perpetrating far more serious problems under the surface, on a regular basis, due to a fundamental, &quot;Who watches the watchers?&quot; problem inherent in a vanguard movement as opposed to a pluralistic society in which titans can hypothetically point fingers at one another as they battle for power, leveraging the common folk&#x27;s sensibilities to de-seat one another.",1452700833

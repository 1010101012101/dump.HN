Unable to grow enough wheat they had to buy from the USA to feed their people.<p>Greece didn&#x27;t raise taxes enough to cover their debts from social programs. As their economy grew worse the cost of health insurance rose and costed more.<p>A lot of European nations can afford socialist programs because they don&#x27;t spend a lot on their military due to the USA protecting the European coasts after WW2.<p>Canada also does not spend a lot on their military due to a partnership with the USA to protect their coasts as well.

At my last job we had them, because occasionally users would upload a 6000 dpi letter-sized page as a 1-bit tiff, or other such nonsense.<p>I&#x27;m actually about to add the same limits at my current job.  It is an online slideshow builder, and most of the slides are scanned photographs.  Last week someone uploaded a 11k x 17k JPG which hit us during a time of peak load and it caused quite a bit of trouble while the server was trying to build a thumbnail of it.<p>> I&#x27;d also contend it really ought to be in the core API, not an optional thing that defaults to no limits.<p>These limits really ought to be at a higher level, such as a ulimit on each apache process.  In a large code base it requires too much effort to protect against every single avenue of potential accidental denial of service.<p>For example, at a previous job we had a lot of reports where the date range could be customized.  This was fine for a long time, until a large client came along and ran his reports for the past five years.

Why? Because the virtual DOM approach embraces javascript and its expressiveness. With templating languages, such as Angular&#x27;s or Ember&#x27;s Handlebars, well first I have to learn its DSL, then I always feel constrained in what I am able to do with them. The lack of expressiveness becomes extremely frustrating on big projects. Then there&#x27;s also the lack of debuggability and tooling.<p>My view is that HTML is just one way of declaring the DOM, but ultimately HTML or some enhanced version of it is just a string. The virtual DOM is another path to constructing the DOM, but instead of a string it&#x27;s javascript upfront.",1441252221

That will probably keep out the neighborhood teenagers who might be wandering around looking to grab a laptop off of someone&#x27;s table.  It wouldn&#x27;t keep out a burglar with the minimal skill of &quot;kicking down a door&quot;.  But the obvious adult activity inside of the house serves as a fine deterrent in that case.  A group of 3-4 armed criminals might not be kept out by a few unarmed people, but sturdy steel doors with heavy deadbolts, barred windows, an alarm system, and armed residents could be adequate in that case.  But that wouldn&#x27;t keep out a military attack force; I&#x27;d need my own army for that.  But since there&#x27;s nothing in my home that would be worth sending an army for, that&#x27;s an unnecessary level of security.<p>The point of security measures is to make it more costly for someone to break in than it&#x27;s worth for them, while simultaneously making it less costly for the consumer to gain that level of security than a successful attack would cost.<p>What type of threat does an attacker pose?  What could they gain access to?  What are the potential damages?  What&#x27;s the cost of mitigation?  Your chosen strategy should be based on the answers to those questions.",1441250809

10163193,comment,10155295,10160823,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"There&#x27;s certainly times when a certain demographic gets in more. Although, your second contrived example (Hooters) fails too as many are A-cups that use pushup bra&#x27;s. Learned that from many ladies that worked at many of them and the ones with smaller tits often outperformed. Once again, you&#x27;d have a less qualified (and profitable) worker if you judged Hooters girls by actual Hooter size. I can&#x27;t even remember a good one with D size at last one I went to. The best were cute but got results on straight-up personality: making it fun for their customers and making them feel like the center of the universe. Customer service 101.<p>Anyway, back to what I think your point is. There are two ways of looking at the quota perspective. One is that it&#x27;s wrong because you get unqualified people and it doesn&#x27;t change anything. The other is that a version of it is necessary because otherwise nothing will change. I still go back and forth on the issue myself other than a few points: clearly don&#x27;t hire unqualified or way less qualified people just for a quota; ensure people get why it exists to reduce inevitable fighting internally; have reasonable cut-off points for applying it (eg 30% women is OK).<p>All that said, we&#x27;ve had many decades of attempting the default method you mention. The result was/is systematic discrimination across the board. The OP&#x27;s Silicon Valley numbers of potential vs hired is a good example. Navy was a perfect example. I also remember a clever experiment where the same great resumes were sent to companies in cities all over the us. Identical resumes different only by the name: one obviously white and one black. The whites got calls 70% of time on a good resume. Rednecks were expecting Blacks to get maybe 60% or something with a little discrimination. Try <i>30%</i>. We&#x27;re talking same great skills and background... <i>just the name</i> was enough to disqualify. At this level of bias, the solution isn&#x27;t going to be popular, clearly not spontaneous, and will likely involve quotas or something. It has to be rather forced because there&#x27;s no attempt to do it willingly. Quite a statement in itself given talent they&#x27;re denying.<p>The overall result is that people aren&#x27;t finding whose best for the position. There&#x27;s actually little evidence to support that they ever did. The data shows that people, maybe you or maybe not, pick who they feel is the best fit for their organization and the best for the position. If your white or male, the &quot;best&quot; candidate is likely to be the same even if the others would objectively outscore them & do a good job. This goes on even when we present objective criteria proving a superior candidate, skill, etc: they just make excuses for decision. Preaching didn&#x27;t work. Showing the extra profit and competitiveness didn&#x27;t work. Showing companies that did this were <i>ON TOP</i> didn&#x27;t work. What&#x27;s next outside initiatives such as quotas <i>FOR QUALIFIED PEOPLE</i> in other demographics? (Emphasis to be clear if I haven&#x27;t as I don&#x27;t want unqualified people at all.)<p>Self-driven model doesn&#x27;t work because few will do it. So, we need something else. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m exploring data-driven methods as a potential alternative to straight quotas. I&#x27;m also calling out Silicon Valley on being able to systematically, analytically, and technologically solve everything except getting people from a talent pool without discrimination. There&#x27;s gotta be good tactics in those bright minds. If nothings happening, it&#x27;s because whoever is in charge doesn&#x27;t WANT it to happen.",1441250324

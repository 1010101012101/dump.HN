I guess if Google can't make the Android App Store attractive to developers, Apple sure can. Surely, this cannot be ""official"" policy, or if it is, it can't be one that lasts more than a couple of weeks. It's not one of those geek-annoying App restrictions that 99% of the iOS target market wouldn't care about even if they knew it - this one affects every end user, and you can bet will be widely publicised by every non-Apple tablet maker.<p>Realistically, three things can happen to people with App under this policy. Take, e.g., Kindle.<p>1) They withdraw the Kindle application\n2) The add In-App purchasing\n3) The add In-App purchasing, but with a 30% price hike<p>Frankly, 2 is very unlikely - 30% is probably their entire profit margin on the sale. 3 is possible, but makes every Android tablet look vastly better to new purchasers (""The same apps from iOS, but with content 30% cheaper!). 1 is also quite possible - they just EOL it and say ""For future Amazon purchases, please grab a Kindle or Android tablet), thus showing a huge chunk of Apples target market a big banner for the competition.<p>I suppose there's another alternative: that this becomes one of the annoying ""Not for big player"" rules that they just have a sub-rosa agreement with B & N/Amazon to never enforce. That in itself is pretty underhand.<p>Overall, my favoured interpretation is this is a re-run of the ""Nothing but Objective C Apps in the Store"" debacle. Masses of bad press, a dent in developer confidence, and a rescinded policy within a month or two. Apple really are their own worst enemy with this stuff.",1296586781

Assuming we scope this to ""licit jobs a middle class American would actually consider doing"", illiteracy is about as big a barrier to gainful professional employment as one would expect.  The exceptions are English teaching, service work at particular bars/etc, and doing weddings as a fake minister (orders of magnitude rarer than teaching).<p>In particular, so help me, I was ready to kill interviewees at a Japanese megacorp who expected to be placed as engineers despite total inability to read a design document or discuss technical topics.

2166680,comment,2166021,2166538,0,0,cletus,,,"Perhaps my own experience is atypical but I'll elaborate anyway.<p>SO had been out of beta for a 4-5 months before I really started answering questions. I had dipped my toe in the water a couple of times prior with varying results: one particularly successful answer, several unsuccessful answers.<p>Granted, now is not a few months after launch. Questions tend to be more esoteric, there are more question snipers/campers and so on. But IMHO the same principles still apply: be quick and be concise. You can expand a concise answer with a longer answer but you can't <i>usually</i> ignore the concise answer.<p>Now some consider that a bad thing. Me? I think it trains people how to give good answers and not just for SO but in their work life in general: front load the information people ask for and then expand on it.<p>As for getting the initial rep: getting rep to vote to close and so on takes awhile but do you need that? The more annoying levels are when you can't comment or upvote. That you can get fairly quickly just by asking 1-2 questions if not answering them.<p>My own experience is that newbies who ask good questions or give good answers I (and others) will upvote them simply to get them past these points (to about 50 rep).<p>As for the barrier to entry and community aspects, there are issues here. In fact, I raised this very issue 1.5 years ago [1] and I still have mixed feelings about it.<p>Ultimately though, an abundance of answerers I don't consider to be a problem. With attrition, others will replace them. I'd only worry if no one is answering.<p>I don't see the value of SO is being in the community <i>per se</i>. Not in the same sense that the value in Quora (IMHO) is <i>entirely</i> in the community (which presents real long-term risks).<p>What SO did well, which obviously affected the community that grew around it (and Joel has spoken about this), is that <i>it made bad behaviour hard</i>, something people would actually complain about. Example: a common complaint is that SO makes discussion hard. Well, that's actually kinda the point. Discussions are 99% noise in the context of Q&A. SO allows good answers to float to the top with the voting mechanism.<p>Remember: rep isn't an end, it's a means to an end. It's also a way of solving problems that would otherwise require human intervention. For example, the minimum rep for editing answers. This isn't a de facto claim that a certain rep threshold means you know what you're talking about. It's simply a way of expressing the site's trust in you, as a contributor, rather than attesting to the accuracy of your technical knowledge.<p>Better that than Wikipedia-style revert wars that require constant mod attention.<p>SO is an excellent system for askers and answerers of programming questions. I'm simply unconvinced that this models translates well to other areas (as per the StackExchange model for other sites).<p>[1] <a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/1483/are-power-users-creating-a-vacuum-on-so"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/1483/are-power-users...</a>",1296585881

That's startling, and goes against the behaviours in the tech companies I've worked in.<p>Really, running off old kit is the sysadmin equivalent to the  ""technical debt"" talked about here in the context of messy spaghetti code.  It's cheaper now, but will have to pay later.  Usually with usurious interest.<p>You should keep servers closer to 3-5 years  Your SysAdmin will say 3, the IRS says 5.  It's generally agreed that after 5 you should give it to your little sister or use it in the test lab.   I mean, I know people who run old servers for fun;  a good friend of mine runs his website off a .com era 10 CPU sun enterprise.   but that's hobby work, and even so his co-lo provider is loosing money on the deal he's getting.  If he was paying for his own power,  he'd probably step down to a single-socked 12 core opteron which would have more compute power and more ram, and use approximately 1/10th the power.<p>At my company, I estimate a reboot to cost me about  a thousand dollars, that is, if everything comes up cleanly afterwards.  Right now, we're debating if we should extend the servers out to four years rather than throwing them out after three.     But in this case, I own the whole thing, rather than one department, so I feel it on both ends; both the problems caused by old garbage and the cost of buying new stuff.<p>Network hardware, generally speaking, lasts longer than server hardware, but depending on the badness of downtime on that particular network, a 5 year cycle still isn't bad, and running 10 year old kit is kind of crazy.   (and if we are talking 100Mbps stuff, you are starting to talk about 10 year old kit.)<p>I remember at another contract gig, I was getting paid around seventy five bucks an hour (this was really a full time job in all but name, so they paid closer to full time job rates than short-term contract rates)<p>A lot of my time was spent repairing or cleaning up after 10 year old servers.   Most of the time when I touched something?  for what they were paying me alone, not counting downtime costs, they could usually have bought new kit.   And half the time, these were critical dev servers; one of the hard drives failed years ago, and now the second was returning read errors.    It was absolutely crazy that they didn't just replace all of this garbage at once.<p>I mean, they eventually did, I was actually hired on to help virtualize all these tiny 10 year old servers on to much larger, newer servers.   But the job would have been quite a lot easier if they had replaced these servers after 5 years rather than 10.   I suspect that the downtime and cleanup ended up being more expensive than the capital cost of new servers would have been.",1296585754

And how is using jQuery equals to not using JavaScript to the fullest?<p>Have you ever used Gmail? Or MobileMe? Or any of the world class web applications built without jQuery? At no point did I say jQuery was invalid, and jQuery UI is a prime example of where I want the web to go. With it, you use jQuery to find the elements you want to work with, and then you use and object based hierarchal to enhance them and work entirely in Javascript, above the DOM. See <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#slider-vertical"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#slider-vertical</a>, a prime example. The code selects the slider, and then uses $.slider to perform all the meat of the problem. Selecting the element is a mere convenience, the cool stuff is done by the UI kit.<p>> The author said ""using JavaScript to the fullest"" and now the author tells us to create ""extendable view classes"" in JavaScript. JavaScript is a prototypical language, you can't use it to the ""fullest"" if you force OOP on it.<p>Use whatever programming paradigm you like. HN wouldn't accept a comment listing all the successful JS frameworks that use class based inheritance because it would be too long.<p>>  If desktop apps are so good, then how come web apps are still around?<p>Your understanding of web development may be amiss, how the tables have turned! Web apps are around because of the delivery mechanism: the web. Not because they offer astounding experiences compared to a hypothetical desktop counterpart, but because cloud storage and scaling, always on availability, and browser ubiquity can be leveraged by users for great gains. Web application developers constantly struggle to provide the ""native"" experience while leveraging all the benefits of the web, but its hard, hence the post.<p>I do however understand your desire to keep using jQuery. As mentioned below, its an extraordinary tool that it seems you and I both use religiously. However, I have found that its hard to scale up a large complex client side app using only jQuery, and I and seemingly many other feel the need for more structured frameworks to leverage in that domain.

The demand curve shows the number of people who will purchase an object as a function of price.<p>Typically the number of purchasers is high at low prices and decreases as the price goes up.<p>The value of the market is the area under the curve - so the  exact shape of the curve matters a lot.<p>The shape of a demand curve can be odd. If you look at the graph the third demand curve has a 'hump' in it. This is characteristic of products like 'jeans' where a lot of people buy cheap jeans, but a significant number will only buy 'designer' and won't purchase at lower prices.<p>Basically all demand curves are very similar at the low-price end. People will take home stuff from hotels that they would never purchase, pens, notepads, rubbish wee shampoo bottles...<p>If you are doing a startup it is important to look up the demand curve and try and figure out what someone will actually pay for.<p>In addition you have to shape the demand curve. The demand curve for designer jeans doesn't have some sort of 'geographical' hump in it - the people who make designer jeans made that hump by a variety of cultural and other means. In order to start shaping the demand curve (and shaping your product to possible demand curves) you need to be trying (and failing) to sell up the demand curve in the interesting bit...<p>There is a big confusion about prices out there. People say 'oh, Twitter is free' when what they mean is 'the users are the product, Twitter's customers are other companies who want to buy data...' People also talk about Freemium as a price when in fact it is a marketing cost (if I give free stuff worth $10 to 9 people, the 10th will buy for $100 leaving me $10 clear).<p>The takeaway is: go and ask an outrageous amount for your half-baked, crappy prototype.

If Google could establish that there was a third piece of info in the tuple, such as ""originating search domain"" and that Bing used this to weight term/click pairs based on the authority of the source, Google's claims would hold more water.  I suspect that Bing has to apply some kind of validation of the term/click pairs (for instance, only sending pairs that appear on the same results page from accredited engines), otherwise they would be subject to ""Bing bomb"" attacks where users or botnets vote up lower ranked (or even unranked) clicks for a given term.  (And if they don't validate or detect gaming, then there would be ample opportunity to inject all kinds of synthetic behavior into Bing's search results.

6349543,comment,6348532,6348532,11,0,RegEx,,,"Has anyone actually got this running yet? I&#x27;m using an Ubuntu 12 VM. I&#x27;ve spent about an hour trying to build this thing. The authors make it pretty clear in the INSTALL file that you&#x27;re in for a fun time if things don&#x27;t go according to plan. Maybe the process is seamless on Ubuntu 11.<p>> Quark has been tested on Ubuntu 11.04. A basic installation\nprocess is automated in ./install_module.sh file, and you can execute\nthe installation script to install most of the requied packages and\ncompile Quark itself. If any of the required jobs fails because of\nsome conflicts in your system, you have to open the installation\nscript, and track down what went wrong manually. As future work, we\nhave a plan to implement a fully functional installation script.<p>The installation script involves creating &quot;tab&quot; users(tab0-tab9), but the install script doesn&#x27;t check to see if these users exist before attempting to create them. If the installation fails after the user creation section, the install script will error out when it attempts to create users that already exist.<p>Here&#x27;s what I did to save you about 2 minutes of brainpower<p><pre><code>    for i in {0..9}\n    do\n        if id -u tab$i >/dev/null 2>&1;\n        then\n            echo &quot;user &#x27;tab$i&#x27; already exists&quot;\n        else\n            echo &quot;creating user tab$i&quot;\n            execcomm &quot;sudo useradd tab$i&quot;\n        fi\n    done\n\n    if id -u output >/dev/null 2>&1;\n    then\n        echo &quot;user &#x27;output&#x27; already exists&quot;\n    else\n        execcomm &quot;sudo useradd output&quot;\n    fi\n</code></pre>\nAs for completing the rest of the install, you&#x27;re on your own, as I was unable to get things working. The install script attempts to cd into some python-browser-8 directory which is supposed to have a makefile, but I never see it created or even attempted to be created.",1378663139

6349540,comment,6347401,6349290,2,0,skunkworks,,,"CBT gets props because its empirical results have shown to be more effective than the traditional talk therapy approach. It&#x27;s been around for a long time, has been studied enough for us to be confident that it makes a real difference, and I consider it as medicine for thoughts. Of course there&#x27;s no way for us to quantify its precise method of action, so it&#x27;s not that different than making the observation that the bark of a certain tree seems to reduce pain and inflammation, but if the burden of proof is to show direct causation from our thoughts and CBT to a better outlook on life, we might as well be asking about the nature of human consciousness.<p>CBT is a framework more than it is a manual, and not nearly as robotic as you&#x27;ve described. All therapy requires a human relationship to be successful. You have to trust your therapist to believe in the things they say, and that belief is a prerequisite for putting in the effort to reshape your thoughts and attitudes, but what&#x27;s so robotic about a therapist asking you to explore the origin of a preconceived notion? About them asking you to be mindful of those type of thoughts? On coaching you to intercept those negative thought patterns and replace them with improved ones?<p>I think chalking up the efficacy of therapy to hope and placebo is a bit disingenuous. Yes, belief in change is a precursor to real change -- no therapist can help someone who isn&#x27;t willing to believe or even want to change -- and in a way, the therapist&#x27;s role is to guide you in your own endogenous healing process. However, there needs to be some rigor in the way they guide you to break bad patterns and replace them with better ones.<p>In a way, the therapist&#x27;s challenge is like inception: how can I plant something in someone else&#x27;s head but make them feel like they came up with it themselves? I think most of us could look at someone with low self esteem and negative thoughts and tell them what&#x27;s wrong and what they should say or do or believe instead. However, that process needs rigor, and one of the best tools in the toolbox is to increase someone&#x27;s mindfulness, and one of the best ways to do that is CBT.<p>I think overall you&#x27;re a bit dismissive of it as a shallow, robotic approach when really it&#x27;s a simple, repeatable, controllable frontline intervention. It&#x27;s not going to work for deep-seated issues, but I think of it as almost being a prerequisite before those deeper issues can be tackled. I am of course speaking from personal experience, in both myself and what I&#x27;ve observed with others.",1378663096

For example driving a motor vehicle in a wilderness is a strict liability offense, though its a misdemeanor punishable potentially by jail time. I think those are very troubling, and I&#x27;m against jail time for any non-violent crime, but they&#x27;re not that pervasive.<p>But lots of otherwise troubling laws aren&#x27;t strict liability. E.g. Child pornography possession requires knowledge of both possession and its status as child pornography.

6349500,comment,6347401,6347801,2,0,slurry,,,"CBT gets quite a lot of props. It legitimately deserves many of them but probably gets more than it should, especially relative to &quot;black magic&quot; psychotherapies.<p>The main reason CBT is so popular in the industry is that it was designed from the ground up to be testable. CBT practitioners and CBT-friendly researchers have run a lot of tests, and they have found that CBT is effective.<p>For a long time, other modalities either weren&#x27;t tested in this way or were only tested under CBT-friendly conditions. And this is a real black mark against them. But since CBT started eating their lunch from 2001 or so, other schools that could afford to started doing their own tests.<p>Guess what happened when psychoanalysts started running their own tests? If you guessed that they went home crying and gave everything up for CBT, you would be wrong. Instead, psychoanalytic-friendly researchers have found (empiricially!) that psychoanalytic treatments are effective, except for schizophrenia, just like CBT-friendly researchers found that CBT was effective for <i>everything</i> including schizophrenia (which really should have been a tipoff that something was amiss in the first place TBQFH). In other words, which therapy gets found to be effective depends a lot on which therapy the researcher wants to be found effective.<p>There are a ton of problems in measuring psychotherapy. Researcher bias is an obvious one. Ensuring that the things you&#x27;re measuring are actually the things that you&#x27;re supposed to be measuring (e.g. that the CBT patients are all actually getting by-the-book CBT, psychodynamic are getting psychodynamic, control are getting...what?) is another huge problem.<p>Across thousands of studies, the biggest variable in effectiveness of psychotherapy seems to be the therapist  him- or herself. Some are drastically noticeably effective across a large number of patients and most are not. The effects of treatment modality, assuming you can pin it down at all, are seldom very significant, especially when blinds and control are used.<p>Other reasons CBT tends to be favored: emphasis on short duration is insurance friendly. Also, the &#x27;cognitive&#x27; adjective implies that it has something to do with recent advances in neuroscience, which it doesn&#x27;t.<p>(FWIW I&#x27;ve had both CBT and analysis, benefited from both in different ways.)",1378662559

Domestication implies selection on domestication traits, which means that there will be a drop in diversity. This is why we eat corn and not teosinte, large delicious tomatoes rather than tiny tomatoes, etc. We have selected on variability for certain traits to give us better crops.<p>> Rendering our food supply more brittle, because we&#x27;ve created plants which need a very precise, artificial environment filled with external inputs.<p>This is just farming. Agriculture by definition is changing landscapes by adding external plants, and tendering them. This has not made our food supply more brittle, but has allowed a degree of specialization that has allowed us to feed more mouths with less inputs.<p>> Now, we&#x27;ve added GMOs, which have decreased genetic diversity even more. (Massive monoculture plantings all with the same genes, with even more artificial needs.)<p>GMOs have nothing to do with diversity. You can breed varieties, crossing wild populations with domesticated ones, and then add in a transgene at the end. This doesn&#x27;t undo the diversity you&#x27;ve added through wide crosses beforehand.<p>We grow monoculture crops because we need consistency for consumers. Look at apples: sure we could have apples that are all genetically different in an orchid. But traits like flowering time, color, taste, texture would be all different. Consumers would eat less apples because many are just gross, and this would lead to huge wastes in agriculture. There&#x27;s a reason we do monoculture.<p>> The reason sexual reproduction succeeded was it creates as diverse of a genome as possible. By reducing that process, and substituting what we think of as &quot;better&quot;, and then making it so 80% of our food supply shares the same genome, we&#x27;re really setting ourselves up for a fall.<p>See above. But also, all organisms experience such risks. Even diverse ones. This is why extinction happens. Modern molecular breeding techniques greatly alleviates this because we can see which varieties confer resistance to a pathogen or pest, and then breed in those select traits. We maintain consistency in product but add borrow diversity from resistance loci.<p>Borlaug&#x27;s success was very simple: no GMO, just simple breeding techniques. He bred for semi-dwarf traits, which allow most of a plant&#x27;s energy to go towards creating grain rather than vegetative mass. How is this inefficient? Why would it be more optimal for us to dump fertilizer and use agriculture space and have it go towards vegetative mass rather than something that feeds people? I agree agriculture is not great for land, but our best option is to make it as efficient as possible.<p>I suggest you study breeding and agriculture if you wish to argue on these topics. These incorrect views spread very harmful misinformation around.",1378662475

Surely you don&#x27;t think everyone has the same placebo effect? Also, you&#x27;re not describing the same study with the same participants and different drugs, you&#x27;re describing different studies, different subjects, and different drugs -- all of which can change the outcome.<p>> * Why does increasing the dose of a specific SSRI have an increased effect?<p>The placebo effect. If people believe that a placebo is working, then more placebo produces more illusion.<p>Also, your use of the term &quot;increased effect&quot; is misleading. The largest doses show an effect, smaller doses show no effect. One theory about that is that the large-dose drug&#x27;s side effects alert the subjects that they&#x27;re not in the control group.

6349432,comment,6348504,6349244,3,0,s_q_b,,,"It&#x27;s funny to hear that perspective from a Canadian. In comparative constitutionality, the prevailing scholarly opinion is that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a modern update to the US Bill of Rights.<p>The United States Constitution has served as the template for countless founding documents, especially those written constitutional documents in most of the Commonwealth of Nations.<p>The innovations in the Constitution were threefold. First, a federalist system in which states ceded only specific enumerated powers to a central government. Second, a balance of powers between three branches with differing missions, members, and procedures.  Third, a specific list of tasks that fell explicitly outside the powers of the central government. These are commonly termed federalism, separation of powers, and the Bill of Rights.<p>The federalism experiment failed, beginning with the establishment of true Federal supremacy following the Civil War and ending with the SCOTUS decisions that expanded the definition of &quot;interstate commerce&quot; to include virtually everything. The United States Federal government is for all intents and purposes now a government of general jurisdiction. This is what they have in e.g. Britain, so this is neither a good nor a bad thing, but it&#x27;s simply no longer a differentiator from other modern governments.<p>Separation of powers is failing us right now. Without controlling both houses of Congress, with a supermajority in the Senate, and the Presidency can accomplish any coherent agenda.<p>Our third contribution, the Bill of Rights, is still holding relatively strong. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a few centuries old, and we&#x27;ve had to update it quite a bit by quite creatively reading rights into text where they might not really exist.<p>So the search is on in academia for a bill of rights that&#x27;s a better model for new documents than the United States version.  The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the most commonly examined alternative. And the Supreme Court of Canada is generally considered more activist than SCOTUS.<p>So it&#x27;s strange to hear that tribunal described as a kangaroo court. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, just wondering how the experience of an informed citizen differs from the prevailing winds in academia here.<p>One thing that troubles me about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is that it has an explicit escape clause to suspend it. In fact, I believe it was invoked two years ago during the student protests in Quebec. An off-button seems like a major anti-pattern for a bill of rights.",1378661386
6349431,comment,6348845,6348845,12,0,coallen6,,,"The author is describing an office culture that is completely unconnected to actual Montessori schooling under Montessori methods.<p>Montessori actively encourages children to develop the capacity to disagree reasonably within teams while preserving civility. The classroom environment and curriculum encourages solitary inquiry into subjects of great personal interest. Providing quiet spaces for individual students to carry out work is a high priority in Montessori classrooms. And, in marked contrast to a hierarchical, command-and-control style education, Montessori allows a student to choose to spend hours of the school day away from the noise and bustle of the classroom and their peers working on his/her project.<p>Aside from considering what Montessori &quot;actually&quot; is, the whole premise is blown by one fact: traditional, hierarchical education systems put students in the classroom, a completely open, depersonalized space that explicitly encourages surveillance and strips away individual privacy. So, tell me again, what does the model for open-space offices most closely resemble?<p>I&#x27;ve read some excellent critiques of open-plan, non-hierarchical office culture and management styles; this was not one.",1378661366

The subjects must be drawn from a uniform population, not from a population that have already come forward for treatment -- otherwise the result is biased by the experimental population at the outset.<p>> Prospective simply means you have decided what the endpoints will be before the trial begins.<p>No, it means the experimental design doesn&#x27;t recruit from a pre-existing population of subjects with a history or established preferences, instead you choose random subjects from the population at large.<p>> The inverse of a prospective trial is a retrospective trial where you have a set of data and you go looking for signals.<p>There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from actually learning what these terms mean. A prospective study recruits subjects from the population at large, people with no particular interest in, or knowledge of, the topic being studied. A retrospective study relies on self-selected subjects, people who are already engaged with what you want to study.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I want to study the link between daily vitamin use and intelligence -- do people who take a daily vitamin become more intelligent as a result?<p>I begin to design a study. Shall I enlist people who already take a daily vitamin (retrospective), or do I enlist people with no interest in the issue, divide them into two groups, make one of the two groups take a daily vitamin, and make the other group take a placebo (prospective)?<p>See the difference? In the retrospective, any conclusion I make may result from a confusion of cause and effect -- for example, if the vitamin-takers turn out to be more intelligent, that might result from a factor like intelligent people taking a vitamin because of their increased awareness of health issues, in other words, it might be an effect, not a cause.<p>The prospective experimental and control groups, one of which got a vitamin, and the other which got a placebo, is much more likely to produce a meaningful result.",1378661359

6349426,comment,6346531,6348833,2,0,cryptbe,,,"> He is right about how specific the circumstances are that give rise to Bard&#x27;s CBC IV attack. Not only that, but BEAST itself was the product of a former NSA cryptologist, now a Wisconsin university math professor; it is vanishingly unlikely that it was common knowledge inside of NSA, since the guy PUBLISHED it just a year or two after leaving the agency.<p>I don&#x27;t think BEAST was a product of Bard. If we read Bard&#x27;s papers then we probably never came up with BEAST [1]. Bard wanted to apply Rogaway-Dai&#x27;s attack to SSL, but he didn&#x27;t understand how browsers worked. His papers didn&#x27;t target cookies - in fact he didn&#x27;t even mention that word - but he wanted to decrypt short PIN sent in POST requests, which is impossible as far as I can tell. The reason we cited Bard was because his English is much better than us, so we&#x27;d thought that we could re-use his explanation of Rogaway-Dai&#x27;s attack in the context of SSL. In other words, we both attempted to exploit the same vulnerability, but we used different approaches and targeted different secrets.<p>Another way to look at this: imagine if one reads Bard&#x27;s do you think if he or she could use any of Bard&#x27;s ideas to invent new BEASTies attacks, e.g., CRIME, Lucky 13, the RC4 attack, <your attack here>?",1378661301

In the open office at my workplace, I can see people moving; I can see who&#x27;s going to meetings; I can see who&#x27;s talking across the room. I think of this distraction, to use a popular new term, as a dark pattern to productivity.<p>I&#x27;d like to call B.S. on those who think great, creative new products come from chattering with your peers rather than working really hard. Ideas are the cheap and easy part, it&#x27;s the execution that decides whether they come to fruition or not.<p>To me the big point about innovation, that I think you touched on and the article is wrong about, is these great ideas only happen when employees have the freedom to work hard on a side project. This is more likely to happen in a flat company, but can happen in a hierarchical one as well. Employees need to know that they can work hard on a gamble side project, and if it turns out well, will also have the freedom to integrate it with the company&#x27;s product(s). That&#x27;s where innovation comes from, and an open style office only slows down the work required to make an idea into a real product, and a hierarchically structured company is more likely to not allow such freedom.",1378660775

At best, brands elicit a sense of loyalty that pushes consumers to purchase the same products over and over again out of habit. This loyalty can be highly dangerous: a lot of people get health problems because they are regular patrons of fast food chains.<p>In fact, most brands actually increase stress. One of the usual marketing goals is to create a need in people that didn&#x27;t exist before.

6349337,comment,6349303,6349315,8,0,tareqak,,,"Article Text:<p>With news leaking out that Apple will soon introduce a lower-priced iPhone, many investors, managers, competitors and observers are focused on how this will boost Apples market share, especially in emerging markets.<p>Perhaps of even greater interest to me, however, is what this means for Apple as a company, and more generally, whether corporate cultures are fluid enough to accommodate abrupt shifts in strategy.<p>My conclusion: Leaders should be careful what they wish for. \nApple has been a modern marvel. Starting with the revolutionary iPod, the companys former chief executive officer Steve Jobs spearheaded an attack on the established order in consumer electronic devices. And this was an industry ripe for disruption. When the state of the art is the Sony Walkman, you know theres real opportunity to change the game.<p>Of course, Apple moved on from iPod to iPhone and iPad, using iTunes to shake up the music, book, and software businesses in the process. The one commonality among all these innovations is not just that they were new, but that they were radically new.<p>Ironically, and unusually for a technology company, Apple was not really competing on the basis of technology. The MP3 player that they called iPod was, and is, considerably inferior to other MP3 players in terms of sound quality. The iPod was a sub-standard technological product competing in a technological arena, yet, it won.<p>Why? Because Apple differentiated on three key elements that resonated with customers: design, access to content via iTunes and brand prestige. The real innovation was embodied in these first two elements, which, when coupled with the iconic leadership of Jobs, collectively captured cool.<p>That strategy continued with the iPhone, whose brand cache was so strong that customers lined up for hours to buy each new version the company introduced. The early Samsung commercials mocking the herd behaviour of iPhone fans (yes, I was one), waiting to buy a product for features the Galaxy also boasted (and often with superior qualities), were so memorable precisely because they revealed just what was behind Apples kimono.<p>The iPad was also a revolutionary product. It even started a new product category that customers didnt know existed. A company that breaks the rules, changes the world, and does it all with panache and coolness is a tough act to beat.<p>That is, until it starts cutting prices.\nCompanies that compete on the basis of price become commodity sellers. That the company Jobs ran could be in a commodity business is almost unfathomable. The next thing you know, theyll be offering coupons in newspaper supplements for phones that are new and improved.\nNow, theres nothing wrong, per se, with a strategy that is all about market segmentation, using price as a competitive weapon and targeting promotions to specific customer groups. After all, thats the bread and butter of the worlds best consumer packaged goods companies, from Procter & Gamble to General Mills. For companies like these, category management and brand management have been elevated to an art form.<p>Culture shift\nBut thats not what Apple is, which means if the company wants to shift strategy in this way, its leaders need to retool the culture in as radical a manner as earlier product offerings changed how people worked and lived.\nWe should expect many employees to leave, unhappy to work in a company that is no longer changing the world. We should also expect Apple to bring in new talent with backgrounds from the P&Gs and Unilevers of the world.\nApple stores will need to keep their true believer sales staff energised to sell ten versions of the iPhone to customers who will no longer feel fortunate to even be in the store. Theyll be more demanding customers who will want to know why the iPhone lite sells for $10 more than the latest Galaxy. Maybe Apple will need to bring back its former guru Ron Johnson, who built out the stores, to apply what he learned from his short and unsuccessful stint as CEO of clothing discounter J.C. Penney.<p>Its not that a company cannot operate with two opposing modes  radical innovation and category management. Pharmaceutical companies like Novartis have been excellent at developing new drugs while simultaneously managing a variety of consumer brands. But its not easy. Novartis, for example, has completely separate divisions in pharma and consumer, with little interaction between them. Its unlikely the mobile device industry can be similarly segregated into independent camps.<p>One more thing: When we add in the latest effort from activist investor Carl Icahn to tap Apples vast cash on hand to enrich shareholders, the winds of change become even more ominous  at least for those who admire the companys track record of radical innovation.<p>The stars are being aligned toward a vision that is the antithesis of what Jobs dedicated his career towards. Rather than making great products that change how people work and play, Apple is on a path toward the mundane, a virtual John Sculley redux where consumer packaged goods are dressed up as high-tech and nobody really cares anymore.\nThe last time this battle was fought, Jobs lost his job to the forces of conformity and short-term profit maximisation. The spiral of ordinariness took more than a decade to overcome  and not until the prodigal son returned to the helm of the company he co-founded.\nThat cant happen this time. If Apple does choose to embark on the new and improved competitive train, many card-carrying acolytes  employees and customers alike  will step off, some to start new ventures that promise grandeur once again, and others to sit home waiting for the new new thing to once again come calling.<p>And what a loss that would be.",1378659914

I mostly can weird stuff you can&#x27;t buy off the shelf in America for obvious reasons, like peach rum sauce (basically a boozy peach smoothie) or brandied every fruit you can think of (brandied apples are my favorite)<p>Anyway buying individual serving fruit is probably going to be as uneconomical as buying single serving jam, pretty expensive.<p>When I buy a couple shipping flats of peaches, for example, its only a couple bucks each.  Ditto crates of apples.  At least in season.  I think if you bought one apple at a time from a convenience store that could add up, but to keep an apples-to-apples comparison (groan) you&#x27;d need to compare that to the price of single serving jam packets, which are kinda expensive compared to an entire jar.",1378659753

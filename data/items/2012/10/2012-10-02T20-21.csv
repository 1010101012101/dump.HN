Clearly, steak is considered a <i>higher-quality</i> food, but that doesn't negate the fact that ramen is food as well.<p>Due to the historical mistreatment of black people in America, it is more socially unacceptable to say something like ""dumbblack""; however, ""dumbwhite"" is no less accurately described by 'a hatred or intolerance of another race'.",1349211524

4604236,comment,4603611,4603986,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"Statistically, you would expect more crime against white people since there are so many more of them. What matters is the probability that a person of a given ethnicity is likely to be a victim of8 violence at the hands of someone else, not the absolute number of such instances.<p>Suppose in a population of 100, there are 20 blue and 80 green people. Suppose that 10 blue people are the victim of green crime in a given year, while blue people commit 20 crimes against green people in the same period. So you could say that blue people commit twice as much crime as green people, which is true, but that leaves out the fact of the population disparity. If a blue person has a 50% chance of criminal insult from a green person, while a green person only has a 25% chance of experiencing that, then it's obviously better to be green than it is to be blue because you are only half as likely to become a victim of crime.<p>Unfortunately, people such as yourself often look at the absolute numbers, compare the 20 blue-on-green crimes with the blue population size of 20, and leap to the conclusion that all blue people are criminals. While the percentage of criminals in the blue population is almost certainly higher on the basis of simple probability (as blue criminals would otherwise need to be >8 more active than green ones), what you have there is a correlative rather than a causal relationship : we don't know to what extent the incidence of criminality in a population causes crime against that population, a classic chicken-and-egg problem that most likely does not have a simple binary solution.",1349211386

4604204,comment,4603611,4603986,8,0,king_jester,,,"> Just look at the interracial rape and murder statistics. Blacks target whites for rape and murder in great quantities. During the Trayvon Martin debacle, a white kid in Kansas city was DOUSED IN GASOLINE and SET ON FIRE while two black kids say ""you get what you deserve, white boy."" Of course, you don't hear this in the media because the media wants to perpetuate a myth that whites aren't victims of racist violence. In reality, they are the primary ones.<p>Incidents of violence crime based on race occur, there is no disputing that. What we are talking about primarily is racism as it affects whites, both on a micro- and macro-level (which is annoying that you taking a derailment in this direction since the original story is a black man talking about individual racist experiences working in the valley, notice how you and others have made this about whites rather than racist treatment of people of color).<p>> I am slavic. Wendish, specifically, if you are familiar. I am glad that my ancestors were enslaved for a while. It brought my culture out of petty infighting and settled us in Northern Europe. My life is better today because my ancestors were enslaved. For me to run around with a chip on my shoulder demanding reparations would be ridiculous.<p>This is post hoc reasoning. You have no idea how the Wends would be as a culture today in the absence of enslavement. Also, your current standing today in no way makes amends for the rape and murder of a people in the past. It should be noted that the history of the Wends is much further removed than the history of blacks in the United States, and that white-ness has become the social norm in the western world, so you benefit from a social condition that directly depends on the exploitation of people of color if you live in one of those western countries. Also, the experience of you as Wendish is extremely different some a black person living in the United States, so I don't believe there is even a comparison to make here.<p>> The government does systematically dismantle white communities.<p>Show me where the United States is actively dismantling or has actively dismantled white community based on race in modern history, because AFAIK there is no such scenario.<p>> Try running around saying you're proud of being white. You're instantly labeled a bigot. A man recently tried trademarking the phrase ""white pride, country wide"". Despite trademarks for everything from ""jewish pride"" to ""latino pride"", he was denied.<p>In the United States, white-ness is considered the cultural default. Most of society in the United States already promotes white-ness above the cultures of people of color. Also, white supremacy groups continue to operate and hate speech is not a crime in the US, so these groups may continue to operate if they so choose to. Note that if you are trying to promote white superiority, then yes you are a bigot.<p>> The FBI specifically targets white nationalist organizations-- Randy Weaver had his wife and son murdered at Ruby Ridge because he refused to falsely testify against his Aryan Nations associates.<p>The Aryan Nations are not just an advocacy group, they are a separatist group that advocates and performs acts of violence. These groups are investigated by the FBI for operating in that way.<p>> Respectfully, I think you are mistaken. Whites are the people that built this country<p>This is grossly mistaken. While whites have contributed to what this country is today, so have non-white immigrants and slaves and their descendants. If you truly believe that white people made the US, you need to crack open a history book.<p>> we are under attack for the same reason that Marathis are under attack in India, and Gazprom is stealing land from Nigerians.<p>I won't be making comments about society and cultures that are not western, as rarely do such comparisons actually contain truth, and I do not have enough knowledge of those situations to accurately describe them.",1349211070

4604175,comment,4599685,4601684,2,0,erichocean,,,"<i>What is the problem you are solving with everything in each datacenter?</i><p>We have two simultaneous goals overall:<p>1. Erlang-like uptime (preferably, as close to 100% as possible). Our product requires this, because downtime is extremely costly for our customers. Our product is correspondingly expensive, although not overly so.<p>2. Extremely low latency. This is why we replicate a dataset to multiple datacenters in the first place, and why all of them are always ""online"", in the sense that failover can be instantaneous. We want each device that connects (especially mobile devices) to be near the dataset.<p>We actually don't use the highest level datacenters (topologically speaking) to service clients most of the time, although we can if a particular client (usually, a mobile device) has better latency to it than to other datacenters. The physical datacenter costs goes up considerably as you proceed up the tree, since we increase the replication factor at each datacenter at each level (maximum of 7). We really, <i>really</i> don't want downtime.<p>So that's why we do this: crazy high uptime coupled with very low-latency. We also put a datacenter with a single dataset on a customer's premises, which gives us incredibly low latency on their local LAN for reads, which of course dominate our system. Our target is a 99.9% mean < 17ms <i>measured at the client</i> (so, round-trip). An edge datacenter is still part of the whole datacenter network, so if it goes down, the client connections will switch automatically to the next fastest datacenter containing their dataset (generally, the next one up in the tree).<p>Finally, our maximum datacenter size is currently 48 nodes. There is no one datacenter in our system that holds every dataset for every customer. We assign new datasets to existing datacenters using a scale-free (randomized) algorithm, which also helps in terms of downtime from random failures.<p>Timestamps are actually per dataset, so drift isn't a datacenter-wide issue. Nevertheless, persistent, large drift would cause timestamps to move ahead of clients, which would be weird. Currently, that never happens.<p>A parent rejects obviously bad data from a child datacenter,  such as a timestamp 5 seconds in the future on a vote. That would simply (temporarily) mark the datacenter as down. Timestamps are not set by external clients, so this isn't really a concern in practice, it's more of a bug detection mechanism.<p>The traffic between datacenters is actually extremely minimal, akin to what git does in a push. We send <i>only</i> de-duplicated data between datacenters, not an entire entity. So, for example, if you had an entity with 100 records, and you updated one of them, we'd send the new commit and the updated record (only); the other 99 records would not be sent. The data is also compressed.<p>We do <i>not</i> replicate secondary indexes. This is one of the problems (IMO) with Cassandra's native multi-datacenter functionality. We expand a de-duplicated commit at each data center into a coalesced commit (everything in the Entity is now physically close to each other on-disk) and we fully expand it out into any secondary indexes, which can be 100x the data of the coalesced entity.<p>Notably, secondary indexes are also globally consistent in our system, not just the primary entity. I don't know if this is true in Spanner or not -- if anyone knows, do share! :)",1349210783

As a bit of a background, I was an EE in undegrad so I took a few CS courses but I've barely done any coding professionally  so I needed to ""re-learn"" programming. I like Udacity because most of the course work is in Python (good for most types of development), the lectures only go a few minutes before you are quizzed on knowledge (active learning), the course is self paced, and you build on a mini-project across the course (building the blocks of a search engine).<p>I definitely agree with @hoodoof that a project is essential. At the tail end of the CS 101 I got a bit bored  but had a side project I was working on as well. I ended up focusing more time on the side project since it was more fun and challenging, but Udacity helped build some fundamentals and jump start the learning. I'd try combining an online course like Python and mini projects (maybe small data analysis projects at Crowdflower or mini web tools).<p>Also, as a suggestion, I'd suggest considering web side projects even if you don't use it at Crowdflower. There's something incredibly exciting about deploying a tool for people to publicly see on the web that makes programming stick for newbies (at least me). Once you build the motivation, you can assign side projects that are more useful for the company.<p>I used to work for the big G where they had a few programs to learn to code (but it never worked for me) - let me know if you want to know why they didn't work.",1349210688

The situation is that more money is needed to keep the company operating, there are three ways of getting money, revenue from products, a loan, and selling equity (stock).<p>Generally revenue isn't a real choice, if it was there then the question wouldn't come up. A loan is trickier, a large loan wants some sort of collateral and if you don't have assets that the lender would take as collateral you are looking at an extortionate interest rate if you can get a loan at all. Worse it adds a re-payment schedule that adds to the burn rate. That leaves selling stock.<p>So how much is the company ""worth?"" and what percentage of it would an investor want to buy in order to participate? These are fuzzy numbers, you can say ""well sales are X and as a multiple of sales its worth Y"" or ""the addressable market is Q and these guys capturing 10% would be worth P"" but really it comes down to if you believe or don't believe the business is a going concern. It is the place startups go to die, because if they can't convince someone to trade dollars for stock, the next step is bankruptcy.<p>But if someone <i>is</i> willing to invest they will do so ""on their terms"" which is to say they will give the conditions under which they will invest. They write this out formally in something called a term sheet. It talks about shares outstanding before the transaction, the transaction itself, and the resulting ownership percentages and valuation post transaction.<p>So nobody steps forward, next step is bankruptcy. Someone does step forward, well now you have a choice.<p>A lot of funding agreements have a 'participation right' which basically says Investor A who has 10% has a 'right' to participate in any funding to keep their percentage at 10% or sometimes 10% of the round. So in our example Founder B says I'm setting the terms at $5/share and I'm buying 2M shares for $10M with a post money valuation of $6.66 per share. Then Investor A is offered a chance to participate at that price, so they figure out how many shares they would buy at $5/share such that their ownership would remain at 10% after the transaction. Or they decline. It is their choice. And they may decline because they think its not a good deal, or they think the company is toast anyway and they have already written off that investment as a loss.<p>Their choice is same voting power in a non-existent entity (bankruptcy) or 1/3 the voting power in a continuing entity. The latter is better than nothing as they say.<p><i>If so, how does a company or a co-founder protect against such tactics? I know about anti-takeover strategies like poison pills and so on in the corporate world, but I wonder whether they are really effective in the early stage rounds.</i><p>The board votes on whether or not to do the funding round or turn the company assets over to the creditors (bankruptcy) You protect against this scenario by making sure the company is always more valuable as a going concern than as piece parts. The board can try to negotiate a 'better deal' which is to say reduce the percentage stake the new investor is getting in order to approve it, but if they are not participating then that is not a compelling argument.",1349209458

(Thanks, ChuckMcM, for the nice post about money and stock.)<p>Mr Cheever is ""something of a product design genius, and lots of people give him credit for Facebook's best features;"" even the now-removed-from-Quora post says ""to him the user came first and growth features would sacrifice that."" That puts him in complete opposition to the guy (Mr D'Angelo, who to his credit is putting his money where his mouth is) who is paying the bills.<p>The problem is that almost every Q&A type site has the same issue as Quora: only a small percentage of its membership is actively engaged. The number cited by the article is eight per cent, and in my experience, that's about par for the course. Since revenues (and therefore stock performance) are directly tied to use, there are two ways to increase revenues, with implications regarding the user experience for both:<p>1. Increase traffic, AKA ""make the pie bigger"". This means doing the kinds of things Mr D'Angelo probably championed -- the SEO Solution, playing nice with Google, low barriers to entry (i.e. Free). This is the tactic taken by most startups, since they're generally looking at Mountain View and saying ""Gee, if we could just get our hands wet in THAT revenue stream, we'd be rich.""<p>2. Keep your existing userbase more engaged, AKA ""get your customers to eat more pie"". This means doing the kinds of things Mr Cheever championed -- making the experience better, providing more services to them, concentrating on getting lifelong customers rather than more customers for less time. Most startups aren't in it for the long haul; they're in it for the big payday.<p>The NYTimes obit of Arthur Sulzberger pointed out the difference. His family has always wanted to be in the business of disseminating the news; their competitors are in the business of selling advertising. Mr Cheever wanted to take care of users; Mr D'Angelo wants to see a return on his investment. If there was ever a startup in the position to do the former, it's Quora; I know my colleagues would dearly love to have enough money to where they wouldn't have to worry for a while how to keep the lights on.<p>But as William F. Buckley noted a long time ago, ""Idealism is fine, but as it approaches reality, the costs become prohibitive,"" and that's when someone like Mr Cheever moves on to his next venture.",1349209191

Right now, if modern USA life was a video game, ""white male"" would be an easier difficulty level than ""black male"". There are statistically less problems for the ""white male"" group.

On the one hand, this article is about racism and other forms of hatred at a large company, which is obviously wrong. It is about a personal experience. Every sentence written tells about what OP endured emotionally. I understand that this sort of discrimination is emotionally crippling and that it affects him <i>deeply</i>.<p>But this wouldn't be my comment if I agreed with everything. Then I'd just have upvoted the post further. The problem here is, that this article also paints a picture about the author and it doesn't paint a very welcoming one to me. The article itself is littered with racism and typical ""anti-hate"" buzzwords. The kind of words I usually hear from people filled with lots and lots of hate themselves.<p><i>That</i> is definitely not the answer to <i>any</i> of the problems OP has faced. Is it understandable? Yes. Does it help? Not at all. Don't get me wrong: It's important that people get the word out to fight racism, because it's still prevalent all over the world but fighting fire with fire never helped and calling a racist any racist slurs only makes things worse.<p>Then there are some things I personally disagree with in general. PC speech is incredibly bad (and ineffective anyway) I think. Not only does it just shift the problem to a different domain, it also attacks free speech. Being pretty fundamentalist about free speech I can't find any good about trying to make a language ""politically correct"". After all, the problem aren't the words. The problem are the values different people assign to them. What we need to do isn't ""banning bad words"", we need to make people more open-minded. If this isn't accomplish, banning words won't help anyway, because one day the ""politically correct"" word will have the exact same value attached to them as - say, for example - ""nigger"" has today. Language isn't written in stone. It always moves and evolves and after all it's a reflection of culture and society.<p>Besides - not really related to the article - I don't believe in never offending anyone. In fact, I think I offend people on a daily basis just by stating my opinions and seriously, I couldn't care less. Obviously, racism is a bit more than just offending.<p>Oh yeah and by the way, last time I checked, neoliberalism was a school of economic thought.",1349209105

Client side is the easier part of websockets. PHP's whole model is 'shared nothing', that's why it fits so poorly with websockets.

I'm not sure how the server side of the websockets are going to be solved. If PHP gets it right, it will probably have great future ahead.

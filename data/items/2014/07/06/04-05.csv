At the moment the answer is no. Delivery is expensive at the scale and speed necessary to compete with going out to grab a meal. But if you believe in a future where autonomous cars are delivering people and shipments in a highly efficient way, mixed with a future of resource abundance (ie robots taking all the boring jobs) where human time becomes incredibly valuable... then it&#x27;s not unlikely that a service like Sprig would beat out the traditional fast food model.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s not unlikely that restaurants and most other brick and mortar business would just become API&#x27;s on top of the delivery model.<p>However, I personally think Sprig is way too early to the game. Given an autonomous, speedy delivery system is (more than) a few years out, they must be handing out their investors&#x27; money trying to compete in the food business in today&#x27;s market while waiting for the distant future. I bet order-taking companies like GrubHub end up partnering with Uber to fill this gap in the market early on, rather than a startup trying to do food + delivery at once today. But that&#x27;s just my 2 cents.",1404622327

He expressed this by locking it with a 4 digit PIN and a message that stated “Give me back the laptop and give you back the money”, with out calling or anything.</i><p>In other words, the seller somehow had remote control of the laptop and locked it remotely? Things like this are why you should <i>always</i> reformat and reinstall all the software on computers you buy...<p>Bruteforcing it is the long way, the fastest way would be to use an EEPROM programmer to clear the EEPROM and rewrite the BIOS. This can usually be done in-circuit without any soldering with a little clip that goes onto the chip. A lot of laptop repair shops have this setup. Some of the newer models store the password in TPM, which caused the shops to initially replace the TPM with a new blank one but some RE later revealed that many (not all) can be cleared in the same way as before.<p>The fact that BIOS/EFI passwords can be easily cleared must be one of the worst-kept secrets in the computer industry - the companies will often officially say that there is no way to reset them and that the whole motherboard has to be replaced in a not-so-successful attempt to propagate the myth that this protection is so secure that even they can&#x27;t bypass it.",1404620439
7993791,comment,7993482,7993575,31,0,mbell,,,"This comment covers much of what is wrong with common interpretations of acoustics.<p>>  the human ear is largely insensitive to moderate variations in volume/frequency... but it&#x27;s incredibly sensitive to phase.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. The human auditory system is sensitive to time variation. Phase shift may contribute a time shift but only at frequencies low enough that their wavelength has reasonably relation to the spacing of the ears. For example at 10Khz the wavelength is <i>far</i> too short for &#x27;phase&#x27; to impact arrival time. Ultimately what actually matters in this regard with the human auditory response is group delay, not phase.<p>> Phase is how we discern directionality (stereo), among other things.<p>As mentioned above, what matters in the context of what your saying is group delay, but that is far from the only thing that matters for directionality. The human psycoscoutic system is very complex, part of directionality is group delay, part of it is frequency attenuation caused by sound wrapping around the ear from the ear, part of it is a half dozen other things. &#x27;Phase&#x27; doesn&#x27;t come even close to being a catch all cause.<p>> To my ears, the best and most musical sounding speakers<p>And thus we&#x27;ve devolved from science, as this usually goes. What on earth does &#x27;musical sounding speakers&#x27; even mean?<p>> It&#x27;s very easy to measure frequency response. It&#x27;s very hard to measure phase alignment.<p>I have no idea where you came up with this statement but it is very easy to measure the response of a loudspeaker, both in amplitude and phase.<p>> If you want to see serious map-over-territory thinking, look at THD specs for amplifiers. It&#x27;s super-easy to measure THD - just isolate harmonics of a sine wave a 1khz.<p>THD can be measured at only 1Khz, but it isn&#x27;t something intrinsic to what &#x27;THD&#x27; means. Measuring at only 1Khz is generally indicative of a crappy amplifier manufacturer looking to inflate their power numbers. Proper specs will provide a 20-20kHz THD rating.<p>> Dynamic recovery behavior, intermodulation distortion, stuff like this is what gives amps their distinctive sounds  - but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to measure!<p>If an amp has a distinctive sound, it has failed to achieve it&#x27;s core design goal. I&#x27;m not sure what you think is impossible to measure, but I assure you it is not.",1404620405

They&#x27;re making claims about the makeup of this data set, that 50% of the documents contain minimized references to US persons for instance, or that 90% of the account holders were not intelligence targets, but we don&#x27;t actually know whether this data represents NSA collections as a whole. There are 160,000 documents over a four-year period. That seems far too low to be the sum total of all NSA collections, so it must be a sample. But is it a random sample or was this data selected by Snowden using some criteria? How do we know that Snowden didn&#x27;t choose data from one particular program or using certain selectors and that that particular data tends to have more or less US persons or a higher or lower percentage of intelligence targets than NSA intercepts taken as a whole?<p>I also find the following claim problematic:\n>> Many of them were Americans.

I also don&#x27;t lean one way or the other - I think the American hegemony has served humanity very well, and an intelligence advantage is critical to that.\nBut, on the other hand, just as there are countries &quot;on the brink of nuclear capability&quot;, which posses the technology and material and can develop a bomb in few months time (like Japan for example) - so is USA approaching an &quot;on the brink&quot; police state, with huge surveillance capabilities, militarized local police and a whole lot of armed federal agencies and national guard units. These capabilities, in the wrong hands or at a time of crisis, can lead America down a very dangerous slope.<p>So I definitely don&#x27;t take this issue as a simplistic one.<p>However, more to your point:<p>1. The &quot;American Establishment&quot; is part of the problem, not of the solution. It&#x27;s a classic case showing failures of checks and balances and of a shady power grab in the executive branch. The support of NSA activities is not a partisan affair.<p>2. In the Snowden case, a significant part of the media chose to label his actions as treason. Some did so directly, and others through adopting the official White House line. It was even worse with Manning.<p>3. The constitution, free market and gun rights lend America the notion of the &quot;land of the free&quot;. That resonates across a significant part of the American public, and that&#x27;s certainly a common perception (not necessarily a hawkish one). Freedom is a concept that&#x27;s rooted deeply in the American mind. It&#x27;s easy for an ordinary citizen to assume that a country placing so much emphasis on freedom would act in good faith to uphold it.<p>If you survey Americans about &quot;what is the most free country of the world&quot;, they would say USA.

This is what these people are dying for - giving us cheap fuel and preventing China from getting their hands on it.<p>Now ask yourself - do you agree with the decisions of these non-religious and well educated people? Yes, it started with Bush and Obama largely pulled them out. But Obama has failed in bringing order and instituting a functional society. Whether that country is even culturally capable of that after the trauma they&#x27;ve been through is debatable. But that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at.<p>Why did nearly 4500 soldiers die in Iraq? To provide cheap fuel and block China? Yes. But I&#x27;ll leave the mathematics of the total estimated amount of oil in the ground and preventing China from getting it to someone else.<p>As ISIS has demonstrated though, we&#x27;re not even competent at maintaining an imperialist vassal state.<p>Seems like a lot of money for what&#x27;s in the ground.",1404619393

But I am in earnest.  On HN we spend a lot of time pointing out logical fallacies, and I love that.  But in the world at large, I believe it is largely a wasted effort.  The sooner we accept that we ourselves would not escape the notice of our own wtf-dar, the sooner we can get to the heart of the arguments worth having.",1404619313

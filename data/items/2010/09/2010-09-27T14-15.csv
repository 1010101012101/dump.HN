Sam Walton is a classic example of a ""counter signal"" and he knew quite well what he was doing.  When he was alive executives were forbidden from driving their expensive cars to the office.  From the Bentonville Walmart store, you can see a large mansion on a hill.  It was built by an executive at Walmart.  Sam Walton told him that if he must build such a home he would have to build it out of site.  Especially out of the sight of store employees.  The man refused to hide his hard earned wealth and built the mansion.  Walton fired him.",1285599555

A CS education can realistically only provide them a grounding in the core theory of the field; it can't, and shouldn't, be teaching them how to work within the context of massive, old, crufty programs that are the norm in the real world.  This is the <i>responsibility of employers</i>, and IMO when employers complain about a lack of ""good"" CS graduates it just shows that they have abdicated their responsibility to train their employers in their own industry niche and somehow expect cheap programmers who are subject matter experts with years of experience in a dozen hyper-specific tools to drop from the sky.<p>But of course the outsourcing shops are perfectly happy to peddle the lie that their own people are programming geniuses who are also subject matter experts--and look at all the money you'll save!  The IT managers get suckered into hiring boatloads of consultants or sending everything offshore, their own good employees, if they had any to begin with, get fired or jump ship, and the cycle accelerates.<p>Sure I'm cynical, but I've seen it happen often enough, and heard the same from friends who've experienced the same, to justify it.",1285599450

""It was found that cell phone signals, specifically those in the 800-900 MHz range, did intefere with unshielded cockpit instrumentation. Because older aircraft with unshielded wiring can be affected, and because of the possible problems that may arise by having many airborne cell phones ""seeing"" multiple cell phone towers, the FCC (via enforcement through the FAA) still deems it best to err on the safe side and prohibit the use of cell phones while airborne.""<p>So that is interesting, wonder if they suggested modern shielded planes.

With REST services, Javascript, CSS and HTML the technology stack for web development has become significantly simplified due to the fact that it is once again digestible. A designer can know HTML and CSS and provide designer services without having to know the intricacies of a back end technology (many times several) further they can graduate into JavaScript UI programming as they grow and gain experience. Finally they can grow into developing back end services. With modern web development the layers have become compartmentalized or black boxed to shield each layer from the implementation details of the others. This is a good thing because a new developer does not have to master ""technology soup"" to become the lowest level of proficient. With current trends in web development, server side UI frameworks make no sense. The take a longer development cycle and they produce inferior results.",1285599001

I am employed, and have been for the past 2 years. My pay is decent considering the low cost-of-living, but well below the national average for the work I do. I am an expert with PHP (OO), MySQL, jQuery, of course HTML & CSS. Also others, but I'm trying to keep this short.<p>I am a single guy in his mid-20's, and I would love to relocate almost anywhere in the United States for a PHP Developer position. I have found hundreds of jobs, but most of them say locals only and never reply. By the way, back in 2007 I did receive an offer of employment and fully paid relocation to Seattle, WA after an application I was working on for a local company was sold to a Seattle based company, but couldn't accept because I was married at the time and the wife didn't agree.<p>I'm okay with not receiving relocation benefits if I find the right job, but it would be nice to receive at least some sort of assistance in the moving process. Either way, I'm not really sure how to go about landing a job in a place I can't drive to.<p>- THE QUESTION -<p>Have you ever landed a job or even a face-to-face interview for an opportunity that required relocation? Do you have any tips on how I can do the same? Would it be unreasonable for me to negotiate the prospective employer to pay all or part of the price for a plane ticket for an interview? Lastly, I'm searching in various places including Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boston, Richmond, do you know of other cities with plentiful jobs in web development that I should consider?<p>Thanks for any help, and I hope this post hasn't ended up being way too long for anyone to read.<p>[edit]
Would anyone recommend moving before being offered a job? If I don't find something by early next year, I was thinking of just picking a city to move to without a job, and then trying to find one after moving, but most people tell me that it would be stupid to leave my current job without having something else lined up first.

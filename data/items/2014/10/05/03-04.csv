8411401,comment,8404414,8409271,1,0,EGreg,,,"Yeah I take your point. Before 1967 one could hardly make that point but after the 6-day war Israel has inherited responsibility for the Palestinian populations of West Bank and Gaza.<p>I guess the main thing I wanted to stress is that singling out Israel perpetuates the problems of Palestinians all around the world. It&#x27;s perverse how the BDS movement and others expect Israel to magically fix all the problems. Egypt participates in the blockade, and the sanctions against Hamas were done by many other countries besides Israel. At the end of the day one should see how policies of governments affect regular Palestinians, and mot just focus on Israel&#x27;s governent alone. It&#x27;s pretty clear that Hamas has been terrible for Gazans, and it&#x27;s sad that they don&#x27;t really care. When they lost a lot of their outside funding they agreed to a unity government so they could continue to get paid by the PA. They hardly ever have seriously cosidered working with the rest of the world besides Israel on a roadmap where they disarm in exchange for raising the blockade and $50B in investment to develop Gaza&#x27;s natural gas and tourism industries. It&#x27;s not like the other countries werent offering such terms. Hamas is just super focused on retaking ALL the land including Israel, an unrealistic goal but hey, they sterted as a &quot;militant resistant movement&quot; and they had to compete for mindshare as the &quot;authentic&quot; Islamic movement that wouldn&#x27;t sell out. This doesnt serve the people they &quot;govern&quot; very well.<p>Just this summer that all came to a head: <a href=""http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/20887"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/20887</a><p>The Arab world except Qatar pretty much gave up on Hamas - Shiite regimes like Assad have been attacked by them and Sunni regimes like Saudis realized that sunni militants are a bigger threat than Israel. They put the Islamic Brotherhood on a terror list along with ISIS and they were the ones who helped back the military coup in Egypt. Egypt participates in the blockade of Gaza as well.<p>In short the region should solve the problem not Israel alone. All those BDS movements that single out Israel keep perpetuating the insanity imho.",1412481431

I find it extremely odd that you&#x27;re asking why people feel &quot;entitled&quot; to make a perfectly lawful distinction...</i><p>I don&#x27;t mean technically or literally. I mean in spirit. The legal distinctions you&#x27;re making are obvious statements of fact. There&#x27;s no need to debate them. It&#x27;s your conclusion that the distinction should rightly lead to people making a <i>moral</i> distinction when violating one law vs. the other that&#x27;s odd here.<p>For instance, you make a distinction between owning your macbook and copyright ownership, as if the latter is only conferred by the state, whereas the former is some sort of natural right. Maybe your failure to acknowledge the sameness of the two is the problem here. That is, the protections you enjoy around ownership of anything is a societal contract that is upheld by the state. Of course, this explains why, in some cultures, there is no notion of private property ownership at all.<p>I just find these discussions to be intellectually dishonest and loaded with rationalizations that skirt the moral issue. All of this talk of ownership really hangs on economic questions. And, if you want to be able to own your macbook without someone making some abstract argument that, say, the origins of the source material are free products of the planet and thus your macbook belongs to everyone, then it seems you also have to acknowledge the economic value of copyrights.",1412481367

8411376,comment,8409020,8409020,1,0,nesu,,,"Hi,<p>Thank you for your courage in making this post. I am from the Philippines too. Like you, I did not finish college. Yeah, it&#x27;s really hard in this country to get a corporate programmer job if you don&#x27;t have that piece of paper.<p>I am solely a freelancer for about 4 years now (not full time though, as I don&#x27;t get to work 8 hours a day). I get mixed results with my career as a freelancer (oDesk, Elance, etc.). Sometimes the monthly income is so high I can take a vacation for three months. Sometimes, it&#x27;s very low or nothing at all. At times I had to borrow from my girlfriend or some friends just to keep things going. Here are some things that I have learned in my journey:<p>1. Make sure that you have winter savings, or it would be hard to raise your rate even if you are qualified to do so. Before I resigned from my BPO job, I made sure to have some savings before working freelance full-time. Unfortunately, TY Ketsana hit, and my house went underwater. I lost my initial savings, but still I was able to thrive with some projects.<p>2. Start with small projects first. Your priority at this time is feedback. When starting out, my mistake was that I aimed at larger projects first. In the eyes of most clients, size does not really matter. Your ability to accept and finish work with good results is more important.<p>3. Personalize your cover letter, but keep it short. In my experience, clients don&#x27;t like reading lengthy messages. But they take effort in writing jobs descriptions. Every freelancer should respect that.<p>4. Higher-paying clients are generally easier to work with.<p>5. As much as possible, charge a fixed-rate for projects. Clients can limit their risks while you can save yourself from time trackers. If it&#x27;s going to be a job for at least six months, it&#x27;s usually OK. If not, it&#x27;s often wiser to give a fixed price. I have seen some bids where their hourly bid is equal to the fixed-price, and get accepted.<p>About your employment, I think you can sue your employer for lowering your rate (if it&#x27;s at least an established business entity). That&#x27;s against the law.",1412480495

8411370,comment,8409994,8411142,0,0,bane,,,"Ultimately the problem is that &quot;morality&quot; as practiced generally comes from some kind of religious backing. &quot;Don&#x27;t mix fabrics because God said so&quot; and boom, it is <i>immoral</i> to mix fabrics.<p>This was an easy crutch for people to use for a long time because it saved them the difficulty of actually thinking about things.<p>Modern social movements away from religion as a basis for morality has put this kind of lazy thinking into a tailspin.

They can draft contracts to license you invention. They can draft confidentiality agreements to make people sign that you hire to help develop you invention. Once the patent is issued, they can litigate for you against infringers.<p>This comes with a price. Patent attorneys will generally cost more than patent agents. At the stage you are at, it doesn&#x27;t sound like you need anything done that requires an attorney. You just need patent advice and reprentation at the patent office. Thus, since you are on a budget [1], you should take a look at patent agents.<p>[1] People not on a budget should probably consider patent agents more, too.

Then training the shallow net to mimic the deep one.<p>The claim is that the shallow net can have the same number of parameters as the deep net. It&#x27;s always been known that a large enough shallow NN can theoretically approximate any function. But that it can do so with few parameters is very surprising.<p>My best guess is that the majority of parameters in deep NNs are unused or redundant. I.e they have a low weight, or don&#x27;t influence the output very much, or another neuron computes mostly the same function. Many types of regularization like dropOut and weight decay heavily encourage this.<p>Whereas the shallow NN is forced the maximize the usefulness of every single parameter to get the same result. It doesn&#x27;t have to worry about overfitting. I am not sure if the paper accounted for this though, it&#x27;s been awhile since I read it.",1412478574

During second world war, in the Atlantic, there was huge effort by both parties to obtain good quality maps of the ocean floor. This was to drive/combat the german U-boats. \nIn addition, &quot;new&quot; sensitive magnetic devises were developed to detect large bodies of steel (e.g. submarines).\nAfter war (during 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s) these new data came out and researchers found several striking features: first, the ocean basis were not deeper in the middle but, on the contrary, were deeper just by the continents. In the middle they found a mountain chain that goes from pole to pole with an average height os 5000m (over seafloor, still submerged). Actually this is the larger mountain chain on Earth.<p>Second, they found that seafloor rocks have a permanent magnetization. This is not surprising giving their composition, but the ming blogging feature is that this magnetization has a clear pattern of stripes parallel to the  mid Atlantic mountain chain.<p>These two observations, that didn&#x27;t fit at all with the theories of Earth evolution of the moment, were the main triggers of the new Plate Tectonics theory.\nNowadays, despite there is little doubt on how the Earth and oceanic plates behave, it is not clear how is the exact mechanism driving tectonic plates.<p>The thermal state of tectonic plates, hot at the mid oceanic ridge and cold near continents, explains the observed bathymetry. Nevertheless there is no agreement in the geophysical community on how this cooling happen. The first order is absolutely clear, but if you go to the details two theories compete to explain observations (the so called &quot;half-space cooling&quot; vs. &quot;Plate Model&quot;). Detailed bathymetry is key to distinguish which one is closer to what happen in Nature. We need better observations that the currently available to advance in our understanding.",1412478181

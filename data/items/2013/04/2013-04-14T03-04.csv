Nobody is going to help you and shouldn't. Because frankly no matter whom you can speak to is going through a little battle of their own.<p>> I am working hard here pushing 19 hour schedules to ensure I have a good life. Somebody else is all welcome to do so. I can understand if the person is ill or is physically disabled. But a healthy person who doesn't work hard deserves his condition.<p>> And in a country like India, expecting somebody to come and help is not a unrealistic expectation but a 'unjust' expectation.<p>I think you misunderstood what he's talking about.  India isn't the United States.<p>Until recently India had a rigid caste system where it was simply impossible for people to move outside of their caste.  If a person's parents were laborers, they became laborers - that was their caste.  It had nothing to do with how hard they worked or if other people helped them.  Their caste was ""laborer,"" so that's the only job they'd be able to get.<p>It's not as strict as it used to be, and it's slowly dying out, but it does still exist.",1365911904
5545835,comment,5544910,5544910,2,0,kozikow,,,"I agree with some of things you say, but with some don't. I agree with the fact that one should verify that there is market for his idea, but you don't need to have sales people for this.<p>Good engineers want to avoid working at companies, where engineering department is not on the top - on example they need to explain things, which shouldn't need explanation, or their boss see them as cost centre, not a profit centre and seeks to replace them by cheaper alternative.
If you don't have good engineers, innovation of your product stales and someone comes to steal your market, no matter how  awesome sales people you have.<p>You mention that sales people are more important in reaching phase 1.0 in B2B companies, in getting these first 1000 consumers. Let's get two hypothetical examples:
- Company A, which creates bad product, but sales manage to sell it to 1000 consumers.
- Company B, which creates awesome product, but their are no good sales behind, so it is gaining first customers very slowly.
Then over the time first customers of company B will tell their friends that product is awesome and it will eventually reach 1000 customers and keep increasing exponentially (these new customers will bring their friends and post excellent reviews online). It is run by good engineers so they will analyse and listen to their users and keep making product better. On the other hand, company A will get terrible reputation, these 1000 customers will realize shortcomings in the product and stop using it.<p>Fact that you created successful company being a sales person doesn't mean that it is better to have companies run by sales people. One example doesn't make it for general rule. Do you know a company run by engineers executing the same idea to do the comparison?<p>You cite the fact that majority of companies fail because of lack of users instead of lack of ability to create a product. It doesn't mean that their failure wasn't caused by bad product  - they could created something that worked, but wasn't good enough. This fact doesn't mean that they would succeed if they would have rock-star sales people on the board. Some ideas are just not fit for market and even placing hundreds of sales people doing the calls won't help.",1365911885

The new money then changes hands a couple of times before being distributed wide enough to have the desired macroeconomic effects. By the time it reaches you our me inflation has already set in. In those intervening steps, profits are made that dampen the effects of quantitative easing, requiring that the fed spend/create more money than it theoretically would need to in order to have the desired effect.

2) Send commands through data link to utilize the newly created control channel.<p>What FAA is saying that<p>1) It is hard if not impossible to actually inject un-authorized code into an embedded airplane system (FMS, GPS, ...) due to strict quality controls in place.
2) Even if one succeeds with 1) then you still have limits of what FMS can actually do with the plane because it is a separate unit from other systems with well defined protocols (e.g. FMS doesn't control the lights in the plane).<p>IMHO, the whole ""hack"" sounds like a BS/PR action. Yes, you can ""fake"" GPS, ADS-B, and other communication protocols. However, there are other sources of information for pilots (e.g. the old and true magnetic compass) that can and should be used to validate and cross-reference the data. From a pilot's perspective, a ""fake"" GPS is no different from a ""failed"" GPS (yes, this happens). One should be ready to deal with this to qualify as a pilot.",1365908753

And even the normal daily variation will be stronger, since when it gets dark you'll not only be increasing your load (turning on lights, TV, cooking, etc), you'll also be losing your local generation.<p>The current electric grid is not built to handle such large changes in load on such short timeframes.",1365908721

So we need someone that can take the PSD's and build them into a front end.<p>We already have an Amazon EC2 server setup with a LAMP stack. Our back-end framework is Laravel.<p>It is up to the front-end guy to choose what framework he wants to use on his end.<p>The project has had some interest from quite a few people! We have a great domain and are ready to build this quickly and get it out there!<p>We have beta access to Sqwiggle (http://sqwiggle.com), so working together remotely is great! We don't mind what state you are from, as long as you are willing to get online and work with us. We both have client work that we do during the weekend, but nights and weekends we are committed to this project. We obviously hope to build this into something that we can put all of our time into.<p>If this sounds like something you are interested in, contact me on Skype: ryHanson72<p>Thanks!",1365908434

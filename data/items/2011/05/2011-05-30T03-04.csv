2598446,comment,2597832,2598322,31,0,wallflower,,,"Teenage girls have known this basic principle for ages:<p>""Can you come over later and help me study for the test?""<p>There are two sides to this. The Ben Franklin Effect[1] and, the theory, that in general, if someone feels like you are attentive and receptive to them (e.g. expert being listened to do by a student, teenage boy helping a classmate (girl) with their homework) that they will like you. Obviously, depending on the situation, we can vacillate between honestly liking someone and faking liking someone. As the old chestnut goes, a great conversationalist is someone who tells you who you are.<p>However, in the field of NLP, they venture a few steps further and attempt to build rapport via various subtle mechanisms, the most commonly of which is mirroring. People do this naturally, too. Go to a coffee shop and observe couples. Couples that are in sync will sometimes drink at the very same moment or if one partner crosses their legs, they may cross their arms (though this is not an steadfast indication of rapport/relationship quality - because nothing is).<p>Observe parents and kids. Especially those having a public meltdown. The kids are reversing the power by hitting a weakness of the parent - that the parent could feel they are being judged incompetent (or at the best, having a bad parenting day) in the public eye. That is understandably stressful. Very, very rarely will the parent with the kid having a meltdown be calm. They will likely become more and more agitated, feeding the child's meltdown. Trained CSR (Customer Service Representatives) know that you never ever raise your voice with an angry customer - let them vent (if necessary), be calm.<p>The best waitresses, hairdressers, etc. don't just flirt (though that may be involved) but make you feel special. They may even, ahem, ask for your help/opinion on something.<p>The problem I see with geeks (and I observe this myself) is that in social situations we tend to try to 'win' arguments - e.g. yes, I'm the expert. You don't 'win' conversations, but you may 'lose' friends this way. And not just geeks - I was with a bunch of well-traveled friends the other day and the conversation devolved into who had been to such-and-such exotic place - 'You went went to Belize? Well let me tell you about Patagonia...'<p>And I leave you with this... true confidence is vulnerability.<p>And, yes, I know that it was possible that the poster wasn't interested in what I had to expound on this topic.<p>The interesting thing about all this - is that, even if you know what is going on, you can still be susceptible to manipulation. Whether on Hacker News or in the office.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect</a>",1306727910

Like you I live in an inner city suburb (St. Mary's Bay) and can walk 20 minutes to my office.  Also like Sydney, Auckland is one of the fastest growing Asian cities in the world, so the food is fantastic.  It's also on a beautiful harbour and, despite questionable general planning decisions, there are great parks and green spaces everywhere, plus opportunities (well, if you know people I guess) to get involved with activities like sailing (Auckland has one of the highest amounts of boats per capita in the world).<p>Auckland's funny though, I'd say we're probably 20 years behind the levels of development and confidence that Sydney is reaching now.

3. Two personal linux servers.

It takes a very big person to never think of yourself as better than anyone else (I'm definitely not that person), but a few points:<p>- Why does the fact that it is people who are less important than you screwing up annoy you more than anyone else? I get just as pissed when I'm screwed around by a CEO as when I get screwed around by a taxi driver.<p>- Some people find it difficult not to get angry at stuff, I don't know if that's just because they've learned to be that way or if it's unavoidable. But for lots of us it's possible to, for example, have a drink spilt on you and think ""fuck that's annoying"" without getting mad at, or even blaming, the person whose fault it was. Even if for some reason it does make you angry, you shouldn't need any motive for hiding that anger rather than being a jerk about it, assuming they didn't do it on purpose (again, no-one's perfect, few people manage to never act like a jerk, and, again, I'm not trying to preach, I'm a long way from perfect when it comes to being a dick to others.)<p>- The fact that people have done less well in life (and/or were less lucky) means you can think ""I've done better than them"", you can't think ""I am better than them"". They're not ""inferiors"", and you're not at the ""top of the pyramid"", at least not in society, just (I assume) in your wealth. Being rich doesn't mean you're good for or important to society.<p>And for all your comments about having come across badly in your comments, that really hits at the heart of the problem so many people have with this rule. The last time the ""waiter rule"" came up on HN it was talked about in comments as a ""yes, you should always be nice to waiters or you will appear like a jerk"". No, that's missing the point; you should be nice to waiters because otherwise you <i>are</i> a jerk. And the fact that normally these views are kept in your head rather than spoken outloud doesn't change the fact that they are your views, your problem isn't that you told us, your problem is that you have them.<p>I know I've been pretty negative to you, but I do feel like you were asking for it.",1306724870

From the station you can get busses or trains to pretty much anywhere in the city.<p>I can leave work and be home in 10 minutes via bus or train or 30 minutes if I choose to walk (Although winter in Sydney can be a little reminiscent of Seattle so its not really walking season). Unfortunately, traffic is horrible because of poor planning. The city sort of just ""happened"" and you can trace some main thoroughfares in the inner city back to the first roads when the colony was just a camp. Your not a real Sydneysider until you've bitched about CityRail and blamed the State Government. In my opinion, if you choose to live in Sydney and you work in the CBD, ditch the car and rent in the inner suburbs. Sydney is gigantic and paying more rent is more preferable than commuting via bus, train or car for an hour just so you can live in a place that has cheaper rent.<p>The Atlassian office in Sydney is great. Its a brick heritage listed building with very high ceilings and even though its open plan its still mostly quiet. When you leave the office you don't take your work home with you unless you choose todo so (So there is no company subsidized Internet connections because your supposed to have a life outside of work). Desks are huge and there is more than enough space next to you to pair or have someone work on a laptop beside you if the need arises (Did I mention that the people here are enthusiastic and intelligent and the problems engaging? No, really!). Its company culture to eat together in the staff area or go out to lunch as a group.<p>Life in Sydney is really good - lots of great places to eat in China Town (Australians in the capitol cities probably eat more Asian food than any other Western country I am aware of) or Thai places in Newtown or Glebe (inner west suburbs which are 20 mins bus or train away from the CBD).<p>Summer is the best time to be in Sydney.

Best story wins.  I reserve the right to decide, but I'll be strongly inclined to go with the story with the most upvotes :-)  (I'm not going to strictly enforce the 25 word limit, so if you really feel the need to write more feel free. But don't get too wordy. It's just a pair of books after all.)",1220859361

298084,comment,297369,297745,0,0,swombat,,,"I'm afraid you're the one who's missing the point. People in the 1920's weren't so used to eating something and making diseases go away. Diseases were accepted as a fact of life (or rather death), and if you had told someone around that time that within a few decades they'd be able to swallow a little pill and cure most of the deadliest diseases of that time, they'd have laughed at your face and considered you a hopeless optimist.<p>Imagine someone came up to you today and suggested that in 20 years' time you can get a jab that will protect you from cancer, aids, degenerative diseases, heart disease, cholesterol problems, baldness, and erectile dysfunction all at once - you'd laugh at them and call them a spammer. Yet the biotech and nanotech revolutions are just around the corner and who knows, they might bring just that, though anyone who <i>believes</i> that they will is indeed very optimistic.<p>AI researchers might be working on sub-problems, but who's to say that they won't stumble on a bigger solution while working on those sub problems? And, again, you're missing the point even more by failing to see that AI is not the only path to a singularity. Enhancing human intelligence can be just as effective. If we create ""trans-humans"" who are vastly more intelligent than we are, we still get a singularity. We can do that biologically, cybernetically... etc.",1220859079
298083,comment,297909,297909,0,0,Protophore,,,"Is there any reason why a successor to Kim Jong-Il could not take this place if he actually did pass away?  It's not like the populace of North Korea is just waiting for him to die so that they can revolt.  Or that the communist party would have to worry about losing power in an election to choose a new ruler.<p>The only reason I can see for North Korea to enact such a ruse would be to maintain the guise of a strong North Korean leader to the rest of the world while they groom a successor.  I can't see many internal reasons why they would need to act in such a manner.",1220859017

Could you guys give me some clue or reference? any site has been discuss those problem? tomshardware (I don't think so)?<p>thx in advance.",1220858861

298079,comment,297863,297863,0,0,metaguri,,,"i think that this article was woefully misguided. not that it's easy to write about something as subjective as music (in the WSJ no less) but i think some key ideas were left out.<p>first and foremost, the article only discussed the sales of famous, high-volume-selling artists. neither they nor i have the data to verify this, but i would be willing to bet that the distribution of album sales across all bands has flattened out significantly since itunes came about. i like itunes because i can find new artists on it through recommendations, search, podcasts... and if i sample an album's tracks and find it to be all good, i do buy all of it. but otherwise... why should i pay for tracks that i don't want to listen to? if an artist is arguing that the album is designed to be heard as a whole, then by all means, prove it.<p>secondly, again although it's the WSJ, i don't think it would have been too audacious to admit that perhaps half of those full albums aren't worth buying, and that popular music was going through a bubble thanks to the dominance of cd-based albums as the only medium around. to me, online music piracy emerged as a reaction to this. i imagine that fileswapping services still have a healthy user base, but the emergence of itunes from nothing to the dominant player in 5 years indicates to me that people are willing to pay for music, when they feel like they're actually getting something for their dollar. purely anecdotally, everyone i know who was a one-time ""pirate"" has switched to itunes/rhapsody. not because we're hugely wealthy, but perhaps because we're discovering more great artists this way, and feel inclined to give them some dollars to help them keep making music.",1220858300
298078,comment,297927,297927,0,0,Protophore,,,"Interesting article, but it seems to me that this is one of those instances where science takes nature farther than it might go on its own.  I can't see that these tests prove anything other than that we can induce a reaction between prions from one animal brain protein from another.  I don't believe that this alone can be used as a predictor of real life occurrences.  There are a lot of things that we can force to occur in a test tube that would never occur by themselves.",1220857952

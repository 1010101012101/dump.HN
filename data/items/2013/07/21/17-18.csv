Which means any API call to a valid resource that the user has access to should return a 200.<p>Then clients can safely assume that if they get a 4xx or 5xx something is breaking, and if it&#x27;s a 200 then look at the body and deal with the actual response.",1374429594

The press does need information to function, and discouraging access to that information would <i>tend</i> to weaken the amendment.

6079574,comment,6078271,6079142,1,0,mwfunk,,,"I started to agree with you, but only because my brain initially parsed your statement as, &quot;you no longer have the right to write an article about what a hacker is&quot;. I would take anything ESR writes about hackers or &quot;hacker culture&quot; (whatever that is) with a grain of salt the size of my clearly-unreliable head.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interesting tidbits and trivia and observations in ESR&#x27;s hacker dictionary and other writings, but it became really clear to me about 10 years ago that ESR has this reductive wish-fulfillment streak that pretty much invalidates his entire worldview. ESR really, really wants to believe that a hacker is something more than a really talented programmer. He really really wants to believe that hackers have a shared, unified culture that goes back to the dawn of computing, and that this culture agrees on pretty much everything that really matters to him, and that this culture is ultimately the only group that matters where philosophical issues surrounding computing are concerned.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough, he uses terms like &quot;our tribe&quot; to refer to the culture, and &quot;the elders of our tribe&quot; to refer to the supposed universally-agreed-upon elite of this imaginary meritocracy. Most importantly (and this is where the wish fulfillment part comes in), he really wants to believe that he is one of those elders. For all of his strengths (and he has many- he clearly has a really active intellect), he comes across to me as a really insecure yet conceited and arrogant guy (insecurity and arrogance frequently go together in my experience). He ultimately just wants to believe that there is some vast and old meritocratic subculture of intellectual elites, and that he is at or near the top of that meritocracy.<p>All you have to do is read through his version of the hacker&#x27;s dictionary for any entries that attempt to define what a hacker is or what a hacker believes, as opposed to the entries that just document trivia, history, and slang. It&#x27;s like reading Heinlein- every time he tries to define what an ideal hacker is like, he&#x27;s obviously describing himself. This goes all the way down to political beliefs. At one time, there was a controversial entry that stated that most or all hackers were libertarians. Guess what ESR was? At some point in the 2000s, he changed it to read that most or all hackers were neoconservatives. This coincided with his own self-identification as a neoconservative. I don&#x27;t know what it says now, I can&#x27;t bring myself to look at it.<p>The &quot;surprised by wealth&quot; essay was what initially soured me on the guy. He was (briefly) very wealthy after VA Linux&#x27;s IPO in 1999, and he felt compelled to write a big long essay about how rich he was and how it validated everything he&#x27;d been saying (<a href=""http://news.slashdot.org/story/99/12/10/0821224/esr-writes-on-surprised-by-wealth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.slashdot.org/story/99/12/10/0821224/esr-writes-o...</a>). This was followed by all sorts of lovely things, like his Bill Gates-as-Hitler artwork that I think is still on his site somewhere, and many many many blowhard outbursts and incidents over the years.<p>EDIT: typos and a clarification",1374429016

6079572,comment,6079305,6079305,8,0,jingo,,,"Hurray for Java applets.<p>But seriously, there is a sunny side to this story: a user could load her own programs onto her SIM.  She could gretaly extend the functionality of her phone... with programs that she trusts.  Maybe even ones she wrote herself.<p>Imagine... an open platform.  Oh gosh, that would be terrible, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Otherwise this story highlights the concept of &quot;minimum viable product&quot; not in the startup world, but as it exists among major industry manufacturers.  For example, if SIM manufacturers can get away with using DES, then why invest their time and money in using stronger crypto?  There are so many examples of this type of thinking... it&#x27;s certainly not limited to imlementations of cryptography or SIM cards.   No doubt, some would say this is simply Business 101... ask any used car salesman.

6079543,comment,6078335,6079309,6,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Exactly. Often it is not the innovators that end up benefiting from showing everyone the value of a new idea (1). Most innovative work is very long term and there are simply not many channels to fund such work. Innovation is often too far up the pipeline  for the originators to reliably extract value. As you point out, the original innovators of the internet and desktop computing are not the ones that ended up with the bulk of the rewards.<p>Douglas Engelbart and his team innovated, originated and practically invented all of modern computing paradigms and interactions. Engelbert died unable to garner interest in his grander vision of accelerative bootstrapping. I suspect he saw modern incarnations as bizarro implementations, outwardly similar imitations apart in spirit. Those like Bret Victor recognize that spirit. This list shows some of that spirit. I would argue RapGenius qualifies too. Here&#x27;s hoping this picks up as a trend.<p><i>Google and Apple both innovates like crazy</i><p>I would dispute that Google and Apple innovate like crazy. They do more polishing and acquiring, with most of the innovative work in service of the product, a benefit but not a new paradigm. Voice recognition, self driving cars, heads up displays, multi-touch,internet blimps. For the dozens of researchers who devoted decades of their lives to this work, the recognition Google and Apple get for things on like that list is bittersweet.<p>This is not to dispute the tremendous innovative thinking and work it takes to package research to a public ready state, I am merely pointing out that true bellwether innovations (2) often go disproportionately unrewarded.<p>(1)  With a negative income tax and library->hackerspaces, that would very often be perfectly ok. Such people are moved more by vision than by monetary rewards.<p>(2) Which will themselves be combinations of existing things, the key is they should be the first to  inspire with this combination, even if in very rough form.

Who cares? If you never use it again, or it never does anything of value to anybody, it&#x27;s not worth anything.<p>Craftsmanship is a great thing, but it always exists inside a larger economic context. The guy laying tile in your kitchen doesn&#x27;t give the same attention to detail as the artisans completing the Sistine Chapel. And this is a good thing! He might not have much education, he buys pre-assembled pieces, and he&#x27;s liable to just slop it in there.  This is appropriate because your bathroom&#x27;s economic value is miniscule compared to a great cathedral. Likewise, if you&#x27;re in a startup writing code, you&#x27;ve only got a 1-in-10 chance or so of your code ever having any value at all beyond just playing around. Completely different picture if you&#x27;re being funded by BigCorp to write version 8 of the Bells-And-Whistles App. Yet some of us insist on treating all this coding the same.<p>So I am a bit annoyed at the use of the word &quot;faith&quot; in this context.

6079536,comment,6078832,6079441,2,0,berkut,,,"Good points - thanks.<p>Although having looked at hopper, I must say I&#x27;m not convinced it seems any more native than a Qt app on OS X <i>could</i> look if work was concentrated with this goal in mind. So as I said in my VirtualBox comment, I think that while indeed it is a Qt deficiency that apps don&#x27;t look native straight from the compiler, more work could be done by the developer to make it more native-like.<p>I&#x27;ve seen controls acting weirdly but only QPushButtons - that seems to be regarding the hit-test area - we&#x27;ve had to sub-class a lot of them on OS X to fix this by making the hit test area bigger which is annoying. There&#x27;s also a pretty bad spacing/padding/layout issue as I alluded to in another comment.<p>I agree with the event stuff as well - definitely one of the biggest things which affects us is that sometimes mouse/keyboard events don&#x27;t get sent to the app if the app isn&#x27;t active or the mouse isn&#x27;t over a particular window. Debugging through Qt, it seems that Qt never gets the event from the OS, so we have to install event filters for all windows and intercept them which is crap. We&#x27;ve also seen weird stuff like key release events being received before key down events - again debugging through Qt, it <i>looks</i> like an OS X issue in that that&#x27;s the order they come in from the OS, but again, without a native version to compare to, it&#x27;s difficult to tell or test.<p>Generally the crashing of our apps is due to graphics drivers or memory allocation issues (we deal with huge amounts of memory), and I&#x27;m not aware of Qt itself being the result of any crashes on OS X for our apps any more than other platforms, but I guess without a native version to compare to, it&#x27;s difficult to say - but Qt is very rarely the cause of crashes in my experience and I generally develop for Linux and OS X.",1374428185

Domain pattern + ip address\n2.) Some expiration timestamp\n3.) Some property that tells you who told you that domain matched that IP<p>The contents of file &quot;google.com.space&quot; then could be something like this:<p><pre><code>    ip4 123.123.123.123\n    expiresEvery 3600seconds\n    lastUpdated 2/2/2013 4:00pm\n    receivedFrom dns.verizon.com\n</code></pre>\nFor subdomains, you could do a &quot;/domains/foobar.google.com.space&quot; file, or maybe a &quot;/domains/*.google.com.space&quot; file, or maybe you just put them in the file above like so:<p><pre><code>    ip4 123.123.123.123\n    expiresEvery 3600seconds\n    lastUpdated 2/2/2013 4:00pm\n    receivedFrom dns.verizon.com\n    subdomains\n     mail.google.com\n      ip4 123.123.123.123\n      ttl 3600\n</code></pre>\nEt cetera. The implementation details would be very important. There are plenty of sub decisions to make to come up with a great DSL. But I&#x27;m fundamentally confident that at the root level, the decision to create a Space based, object oriented domain system is not only correct, it is inevitable. It just feels right to me. Again, I&#x27;ve had the benefit of working with this structure for a while now, and am amazed at how so many things simplify down to it. Space is object oriented programming in an extremely simple, concise, robust, human readable way. Just as most (if not all) major computer programs nowadays are written in an object oriented way, I am predicting there will come a time when most major message passing systems are written in a Space encoded way.<p>> That makes it trivial to e.g. modify zones files in shell scripts with tools like &quot;awk&quot; etc.<p>I look at awk and I think that&#x27;s something that will at some point be buried, and should be. awk is kind of like a neanderthal or some other species in between ape and human.

Carriers use this key to remotely program a SIM, and it is unique to each card.</i><p>This is a little vague and I don&#x27;t understand the OTA protocol like, at all, but what it sounds like is that there is a case in some implementations of SIM OTA where (a) errors for improperly signed messages are noisy, (b) those errors include some of the plaintext of the improperly signed message, and (c) the error message itself has a signature that is intended to be valid only for the error.<p>Possible next steps: (i) you can table-solve for the signature (presumably this is a MAC, not a signature) for your intended message due to the way plaintext hits the error message, or (ii) you can table-solve for the plaintext of a previously unknown ciphertext by taking that ciphertext, flipping a bit to invalidate the signature, and collecting the error signature.",1374427700

He would then measure the curve of how hard the mice were willing to spin a wheel for a given amount of current into their brains.<p>The model was that mice willing to beat their bodies more for the same amount of stimulation were more susceptible to a wide range of addictions.  He found that pups exposed to cocaine in utero did in fact as adults spin the wheel harder for a given amount of stimulation, indicating higher susceptibility to a wide range of addictions.<p>My old room mate would have really liked to perform the same study with nicotine, since many many more human mothers dose their fetuses with nicotine as compared to cocaine.  For what the wild speculations of an experienced researcher are worth, he suspected that mouse pups exposed to nicotine would also be more susceptible to addiction (supposing he was actually measuring susceptibility to addiction).<p>However, politicians and lobbyists have made it much easier to get federal grant money for cocaine studies vs. nicotine studies, despite nicotine having a much larger impact on society.<p>On a side note: in 1999, 4.7% of US 8th graders were willing to admit to having used cocaine, so the test group appears to be below US averages for cocaine use, despite their mothers using cocaine.  I imagine that being predicated upon having mothers caring enough to place their children in these studies, and mothers responsible enough to stay in contact with researchers, and the subjects knowing they were being studied, skewed the drug usage portion of the study.

It more-or-less worked, but was pretty flaky (fluctuating speed, lots of trouble streaming video, resetting the powerline adapters and/or other devices several times a week, etc.). Eventually I started to notice patterns, like speed always dropping when we ran the washer or dryer.

When I comment on things, it is from that perspective, not from a juridical precedence perspective, like you. If you want to engage the philosophical issues, cool. If you want to engage practical issues with the philosophical ones, cool. If you want to challenge points with problems posed by legal precedence and practice, that&#x27;s awesome, cos I love that stuff (I appreciate the mention of Floyd, as it reminds me to pick up his work).

1447153,comment,1446446,1447106,0,0,grandalf,,,"We knew spills are bad before the Deepwater Horizon spill, however the estimates of environmental damage (for the worst case scenario foreseen) were far smaller than what has already occurred with the Deepwater Horizon spill.<p>Why?  Because spills of the magnitude of this one are quite rare.  But, like any low probability event, as the time horizon increases the probability approaches 1.<p>Obama knows that another spill is very unlikely to happen soon, so he is under no pressure to create a new regulatory environment that actually reduces that probability.<p>The gulf is a public resource, and so the question for the American people should be something along the lines of:  If we are likely to get a Deepwater Horizon level spill every 20 years, should we still allow drilling?  My guess is that (barring misinformation) most Americans would agree that we should absolutely not allow any offshore drilling at all.<p>Offshore drilling in the US does not have a meaningful impact on oil/gas prices as experienced by consumers.  It simply enriches the firms that extract that oil, but not enough is extracted to significantly impact the market price of a global commodity.<p>Supporters of offshore drilling claim that gas would be $10 at the pump without it... which is total nonsense.  If anything we'd see about a $0.05 increase per gallon at the pump.<p>What is your explanation for why Obama is not doing more to create systematic reforms that decrease the chances of another spill?  It sounds like you think he wisely views the risk as acceptably low.",1277067395

1447150,comment,1446717,1446951,0,0,pmcginn,,,"The truth is that this practice of ""don't offer, but do if asked"" is the basic operating method of most large companies.  As a customer you have to learn to be equally careful in wording your requests.  If someone calls in wanting a credit but doesn't say those words, there are many examples where you're not allowed to offer the credit.  But if they're smart enough to ask for a credit, and they've never had one before for that specific issue, then generally you can provide it.  This goes for banks, telcos, utilities, whatever.<p>The next time you're on the phone, if you get a response that sounds like the CSR has had to say it a thousand times, the truth is you're probably just not asking the right question.<p>Case in point: at two companies I've worked for, we've had a military discount.  But, we weren't able to offer it, even if it came up in conversation.  If someone told me ""I'm being deployed so I need to make sure my wife can pay my bill while I'm gone,"" I would have been required to walk him through adding her as an authorized user on the account.<p>On the other hand, if he said the exact same thing and finished with ""oh, by the way, do you have a military discount,"" then all of a sudden his monthly bill is going to get lower (lowered by a lot in one case.)",1277067309

Otherwise it lies with the candidate.<p>I also think the OA's advice misses out on the notion that it is a two-way street: the employer is also applying to the candidate for the priviledge of getting that person's future time and commitment, and taking on the opportunity costs that candidate will incur if they end up working for you.",1277064169

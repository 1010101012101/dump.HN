When you have a single point of failure which is a black box you&#x27;re just back to windows land: restart the service, reboot the computer, reinstall the system.</i><p>For the developers, on the other hand, it might mean that some use case that is important for the admin is simply not yet implemented. The solution, as so often, is... <i>drumroll</i> to report a bug! Developers care about their users. Just talk to them.<p>Also, admins should realize that &quot;reducing complexity&quot; is a goal that they share with the developers. systemd is all about reducing complexity by implementing functionality the right way, on the right layer. For example, with systemd it&#x27;s way easier to write a daemon, because it takes care of<p>* daemonizing: just stay in foreground<p>* logging: just output to stdout/stderr. journald will collect everything, and if you want, forward it to a classic syslog service<p>* startup: no more shell scripts required, just a simple service file<p>* supervision: just add &quot;Restart=on-failure&quot; to your service file. It also supports software watchdogs.",1413723470

No thanks. That&#x27;s not necessary anymore. Apple has proved that fingerprint identities don&#x27;t need to be stored in a centralized place. And reading through their eID authentication protocol [1], I believe Estonians know this, yet they keep pushing for the centralized version.<p>In the document it even says storing fingerprints in a centralized place is <i>extremely risky</i>.

Perhaps not his fault (I&#x27;m sure in the year 4000 Bertrand Russel and Ludwig Wittgenstein will be considered obsolete gibberish). The point is that attributing truth value to authority is bad. Western science halted for many centuries because truth value was given to what Aristoteles said (or didn&#x27;t say).

This is pure conjecture on my part—I&#x27;m not close to the systemd project or the various distros—so please take it with a grain of salt.<p>Programmers prefer to do less work. Simple tools get the job done and are easy to understand, but often require more effort to use effectively. Using a hand saw, it is hard work to cut a solid piece of wood, but the only servicing it needs is to sharpen the blade. On the other hand, with a chainsaw it is much easier to cut through wood, but there are many more things that you need to care about to keep it running smoothly. When put this way, the hand saw seems superior in its simplicity, but remember that it&#x27;s not immediately obvious that chainsaws can be difficult to start, or that the chains get stuck sometimes. Standing in the hardware store, the chainsaw might seem like the way to go, but one might regret not choosing the simpler option when complications arise later.<p>It seems to me (conjecture, remember) that systemd offers a lot to the distros. It gives them hooks to manage difficult things and, after all, the systemd people are doing all the work. That explains why the distro maintainers might choose it, but my worry is that the convenience comes at a cost.",1413722307

There is no requirement or reason why you should be required to take computer science to be a programmer.  There are plenty of coding jobs out there that do not require (in principle or practice) a CS degree.<p>On top of that, having a CS degree is no guarantee of someone being even a decent coder.  There are tons of crappy CS grads who are bested by people with no degree, associates degrees, and random liberal arts degrees (e.g. philosophy, english).<p>You are right about the cost of boot camps.  However, the exact same argument could be made against traditional 4 year college programs and masters degrees.<p>Ultimately, what you learn in the class is quickly eclipsed by what you learn on the job and in through continuous self study and pursuit of knowledge.",1413721914

There is neither distaste nor bias.&quot;<p>The question is, why do they leave the workforce? If it&#x27;s because of a self-reinforcing belief that they less valuable solely because they are women, then it&#x27;s sexist. If such a belief is widespread and entrenched, it means the culture is sexist.<p>Eg, if it&#x27;s because women want to take a year off after the first child, then one interpretation is that it&#x27;s a choice. But the question is, why don&#x27;t the men want to take a year off? Is it due to cultural expectations? Is it that mean get paid more because of a built-in expectation that they will be the ones supporting the family? If so, there&#x27;s a sexist cultural component to the decision.<p>Hence the more feminist cultures have parental leave. Sweden, where I live, has paid leave for both parents, and some of the leave can only be taken by the mother and some only by the father. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the leave is split 50-50. More women take time off than men. One interpretation is that Swedish culture is still sexist. It does bring a smile to my face to see the number of fathers out with their kids, compared to what I&#x27;m used to from the US.<p>Or as another example, consider one of the famous cases of sexual discrimination at work. Quoting from the EEOC, &quot;In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., a shipyard company employed a female welder who was continually subjected to nude and partially nude pictures posted by her male co-workers. The men posted these pictures not only in common areas, but also in places where the victim would have to encounter them, including her tool box. The men referred to the victim as &quot;baby,&quot; &quot;sugar,&quot; &quot;momma,&quot; and &quot;dear.&quot; In addition, the men wrote obscene graffiti directed at the victim all over the plant. The men also made numerous suggestive and offensive remarks to the victim concerning her body and the pictures posted on the walls. The victim complained about this atmosphere of harassment on a number of occasions, but the company&#x27;s supervisory personnel provided little or no assistance. The court found this conduct violated Title VII because the plaintiff belonged to a protected category, was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment, the harassment was based on sex, it affected a term or condition of her employment, and the employer knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take remedial action.&quot;<p>If most women exit the workforce in order to avoid harassment caused solely because of their gender, then it&#x27;s due to sexist reasons.<p>Hence why pron and I disagree with your assessment that &quot;Normally the term [sexist] implies some sort of (non-productivity based) distaste for women or bias against believing they will be productive.&quot; The sexual harassment in Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc. had little to do with her being productive or not, but because she was a woman. I have little doubt that being the most productive person in the group would still have resulted in sexist behavior, and in any case if she were not appropriately productive she would not have been promoted to first-class welder.<p>Pron wrote &quot;Sexism is any gender based discrimination that is not 100% provably biologically justified.&quot; Such a definition is in close agreement with the EEOC definition of discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. (They aren&#x27;t the same; I assume that &quot;100% provably biologically justified&quot; is for wet nurses and surrogate mothers, while the EEOC allows a wider range of &#x27;bona fide&#x27; reasons to discriminate on the basis of sex, like only hiring men as Chippendale dancers.)<p>Your definition is not, which leads to the strange observation that you must think that some forms of sexual discrimination which are due to the victim&#x27;s gender are not actually sexist.",1413720108

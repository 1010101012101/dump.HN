It was on-par with Dallas with rents and overall cost of living.<p>That is with the glaring exception that Dallas has no income tax but a high sales tax. Chicago has both.",1268737069
1195413,comment,1195346,1195400,0,0,Mc_Big_G,,,"I would start by finding the best online communities of DIYers and read everything you can.  If you're near a big city, you can probably find IRL groups to check out.  You can do anything alone, but you can accelerate the learning process by collaborating or, better yet, finding a mentor.<p>You didn't mention your present circumstances, but a good university will help immensely with this type of field.  You can also make a lot of contacts if you go to the right school.<p>With all of that said, I'm not sure how far you can go if you aren't truly interested in it.  Just keep trying different things, giving each a respectable amount of effort, and eventually something will strike a chord with you and you'll know what you want to do.",1268736978

1195408,story,,,5,3,Tichy,"Ask HN: techniques for basic graphics design (for programmers)?",,"I am at this point again, where non-existent design skills are slowing me down too much. So I wonder what is a good way to get a basic level of proficiency?<p>As an example, I am not even sure how to get started (preferably with free tools). Attach a tablet to GIMP or Inkscape? I just can't imagine how to draw a circle at a specific position and specific radius with a graphics tablet? I know the graphics programs can usually tell you the coordinates and circumference with some tricks (hold certain key combinations), but typing drawCircle(x,y,radius) seems so much easier than digging for such tricks in the manual. And then what if your circle is 10 pixel too far right - it seems so tedious to shift things around in a graphics program. So how do designers typically go about it? My first impulse is always to start learning the scripting languages of those graphics programs... (Couldn't find one for Inkscape, though).<p>Maybe a good approach would be to sketch the design with a pencil, then try to mimic the design with code?<p>What would be a good environment for scripting graphics? Probably targeting SVG would be good...",1268736649

What does ""keeping one's job"" even mean? isn't there still a mutual contract, and both parties can break out of it? So the boss can act on behalf of the company, and you can't. But presumably you can still quit the job on your own decision. Does that make the boss your subordinate?<p>It seems the boss has more leverage, as the worst you can do to him is quit, whereas he can fire you. But both parties can hurt each other.<p>I hope I'll never have to enter such an environment again.",1268734938

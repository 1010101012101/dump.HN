655651,comment,655487,655622,0,0,serhei,,,"> One media market that never caved to idiotic lawyering (w.r.t US vs. Canada issues anyway) is video games.<p>Maybe because a reasonable chunk of the game industry is <i>in</i> Canada, and an even more reasonable chunk is outside North America all together (so that releasing in Canada as well as US isn't that big of a hassle as the hassle of going international from domestic).<p>Compare to entertainment (Hulu), where Canadians tend to import a vast (and to some disturbing) majority of the ""culture"" from the United States. Entertainment is much, much more centralized, and it's centralized in the US. Which is why Canada has Canadian content regulations (does Hulu have to abide by those? and if so, how do you define 'airtime' when it's on-demand? and a million other questions I have no idea about), and indirectly why nothing is ever available in Quebec (overall the asinine Quebecois laws are there because that's the price Quebec is willing to pay to maintain its own cultural and political identity).<p>For small countries, there is therefore a certain plus side to partially giving up sovereignity to join an effective economic superstate like the EU. Cross-border penetration of cool gadgets is just one part of this. Sadly, the only economic superstate bordering Canada is the United States which Canadians are, let's say.. ambivalent about joining.",1244854065

Well, I agree that it's premature to generalize definitively to humans in general, and this is a problem with psychology experiments in general: any particular experiment is necessarily very restricted in scope, and generally N is very small, so it's hard to have confidence in anything more than simple linear models.<p>Occam's razor suggests that it's more likely, given this one data point, that it's true of all people than that it's only true of the people that happened to be in the sample.

It’s hard to quantify the COST of moving to a startup (months of distraction, expense, stress, loss of social network, etc)</snip></i><p>The cost / benefit thing isn't entirely monetary.<p>It's one of those things where if you're crazy enough to just do it (move), it's something you can look back on and say ""glad I did.""  At least in my experience it has been.<p>It's also one of those things where if you really don't have much to ""lose,"" there's a lot of room for gain.  Moving, yeah, expensive.  Getting robbed, yeah, sucks.  Cost of living, yeah, ridiculous.<p>But, I've viewed the experience as an extremely valuable extension of my University education.  I've learned a lot: much more than I thought possible from the random spattering of techie-events I've attended.  OSMCS 2007 is pretty much the reason I implemented Drupal on my site.  :) And the social network here really is great.<p>So while I'm not endorsing a full-fledged ""move"" to SV for startuppers, it <i>is</i> the 21st Century.  Travel.  Experience life while you're young and can have fun.<p>After I founded my LLC, I ""moved"" it from Arizona to Utah (very temporary stopover there) to Cali in its first year.  The portable nature of a web business has been one of the greatest things about the work.

It looks like it might even happen given the signs from Washington recently.  And I have no moral problem with the government offering an insurance plan as long as it is voluntary to participate and the lion's share is paid for by its participants.<p>Sounds like there is a chance of something good happening but I fear the perversions.

When you configure an ISAPI filter in IIS, such as ASP.NET or PHP, you can choose whether or not to verify the presence of files. You can also do this via configuration for .NET HTTP handlers. Parts of ASP.NET itself rely on this feature, such as the trace.axd handler and the  web resource handlers.<p>I don't have the option to verify that you can't create those routes, but if you can't, it's not related to that particular feature.",1244852315

Amazon, Newegg, Grand Central (now Google Voice), pretty much all the big media video networks.. etc.<p>The funny thing is that American companies that engage in this kind of anti-cross-border behaviour may never realize just how much hostility they're brewing up against their products before they even finally arrive in Canada. By then there may be home-brewed alternatives. In the case of media, I think this will be particularly interesting because TV viewership amongst my demographic seems to collapsing in certain circles, yet people still want to jump online and view/share their clips. These are often blocked (or redirected to Canadian sites which have less content or use undesirable plugins/tech to show video).<p>So what's your alternative? Well, nothing! You go do something else. If the Big Media companies drag their asses on this issue I wouldn't be surprised if it had severe long term repercussions, causing people to switch to other forms of entertainment, brands, etc. One media market that never caved to idiotic lawyering (w.r.t US vs. Canada issues anyway) is video games. Perhaps we'll see that win out over time.<p>I find it hard to believe that a reasonably wealthy country with a population just under the size of California is ignored and blocked so systematically. It's actually the effort given to blocking our IPs that's the most surprising. I mean, don't Hulu's ad clients want me to buy their products up here too? ..

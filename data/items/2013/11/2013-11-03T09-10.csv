Eventually the initial failure would be converted into something usable by spending 10x more money and 10x more time.<p>Contrary, a minority of national-level projects that succeeded here were always almost things that were initially planned to be very small, experimental, with no hard deadline and implemented without a big-bang in media. The biggest distinction is that the small systems tend to be put in production only partially but much earlier, often as an opt-in, working in parallel to the old often paperwork based systems. So there was no huge switch to something new and the risk was pretty small. This is what agile means to me.",1383472792

Doesn&#x27;t it make sense for Google to try and stop rooting through vulnerabilities, just like Apple tries to stop jailbreaking with every update?<p>From what I understand, rooting should still be possible if the bootloader is unlockable (which it is for Nexus devices, HTC&#x27;s devices, and I think Sony&#x27;s too). Samsung and a few others, on the other hand, don&#x27;t let you unlock the bootloader. So maybe we should take it up to them, and demand unlockable bootloaders, so we can modify our devices, instead of asking Google to turn a blind eye to Android exploits.",1383472786

I don&#x27;t think anyone believes Obama parachuted into GM to lead it like George Washington across the Potomac. Rather, they were extended a loan to give them time to turn around. Without executing on a plan, money alone would not have rescued the company, but without the government loan, they would have been doomed as no one in the private sector was capable of raising or loaning tens of billions in cash in 2008.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this will form a future right wing talking point in the redstate blogosphere, again, trying to rewrite Obama&#x27;s term in office and diminish each one of his policy achievements.

Pre-Android 4.2, it was perfectly fine to connect it. Bluetooth uses the code &#x27;000000&#x27; for this and a third party application can hook through.<p>With Android 4.2 and 4.3, the ability to connect Bluetooth devices to connect without using a code determined by the phone was removed. It was possible to root the phone and set it to a specific MAC address for the Bluetooth interface, from which the Bluetooth code was generated, so that this Bluetooth code would be &#x27;000000&#x27; and the Wiimote would connect correctly.<p>Now with Android 4.4 the answer is going to effectively be &#x27;forget it&#x27;...<p>I&#x27;m sorry but if what seems to become the most ubiquitous operating system out there cannot connect to probably the most ubiquitous gamepad in recent memory (and quite a few others that exhibit the same problem), using a standard that both of these devices support, then that&#x27;s just a tad ridiculous.

If the guarantees break(request locals leak to other requests), it will be a problem. I never have had a request local leak in flask. On the other hand, I have ran into cases where I need the request object in django signals. A simple task of getting the full uri requires either a request object(I would say that&#x27;s bad api but that&#x27;s how it is in django) or configuring sites. Bad api or not, if I am in a request, I should have access to it, and Django makes it hard. Dress it up if you want to comply with &quot;no globals&quot; - RequestManager.get_current_request().

6662623,comment,6661019,6662545,2,0,irahul,,,"> Views are functions from Request to Response in Django,<p>The thing that irritates me about django is request is passed as an argument, and if you need if further down the chain, you have to pass it around. I want the request object to be available throughout the request cycle without it being explicitly passed. I like the flask model of importing request when you need it. In Django, I can have a middleware to handle it for me:<p><pre><code>    from threading import local
    _locals = local()
    class ThreadLocalMiddleware(object):
        def process_request(self, request):
            _locals.request = request

        @classmethod
        def request(cls):
            return _locals.request

        @classmethod
        def locals(cls):
            return _locals
</code></pre>
But then there are edge cases. What if the threads are being reused? What about greenlets? I am thinking of taking out the flask/werkzeug implementation of locals and LocalManager<p>>  Very full-featured templates & helper functions.<p>Django templates are nice; Jinja2 is nicer:-)<p>> Lighter-weight microframeworks like Flask don&#x27;t have this property.<p>I think it&#x27;s not just about Flask being light weight. It&#x27;s more a function of Django existing for longer and being more popular. Granted that Django itself includes lot of batteries which Flask doesn&#x27;t, but the &quot;somebody has already solved it&quot; is mostly either an extension, or a forum/stackoverflow solution.",1383469524

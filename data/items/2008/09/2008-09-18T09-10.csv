308053,comment,307584,307824,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Agreed. Which means there is already a market with market players involved. I think that's good news, not bad.<p>So what are your differentiators? Well you're virtual, not physical. So you can be changed easily. Plus you can offer all sorts of interactive multi-media instead of paperwork. You could electronically interact with other services, such as FaceBook or MySpace, where other older services couldn't.<p>I'd use my differentiators (and there's more than I listed) to explore some market niches.<p>There's nothing wrong with trying to create an entirely new market with a free service. To me, that's swinging hard for the home run. Or you could just take a good base hit and enjoy what you can get. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer. I do think that we startup types usually think big. ""Big"" is a very relative term -- a successful entry in an existing market could be a lot better risk/reward scenario than making it all up from scratch.",1221731761

All of it.<p>I feel bad for the script kiddies that did this.

And, if you have any sort of ""ideological"" basis for your acts, I wouldn't be surprised to hear the word ""terrorism"" creep into the DA's vocabulary at some point during your legal proceedings.",1221730314

And I've been pondering over what are the basic infrastructure for a software project. These are the stuff that I think every project should have:<p>-Coding style conventions<p>-Naming conventions<p>-Standard project directory structure(eg maven standard dir layout, etc)<p>-Project management and issue tracking(eg trac, redmine, etc)<p>-Continuous Integration server(eg, hudson, cruise control, etc)<p>I'm not sure if I missed out anything.

308034,comment,307722,307855,0,0,olavk,,,"The value of regex-validating emails and urls are limited. Validation is mostly useful for flagging completely malformed input, like people writing ""asdf"" or ""I dont have an email, plz use fed-ex."".<p>Regex validation will not catch common typos (or made-up emails) because they tend to look like correct emails. So the intricate, syntactically correct email validation regexes are a solution in search of a problem.<p>If you really want to be sure that the email is correct, you have to send a confirmation mail. For your input validation, just check that there is a ""@"" somewhere.",1221728485

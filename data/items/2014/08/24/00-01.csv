Heartbleed is a great example of that. But in cases like these, it&#x27;s a very good thing. This is why I always like to remind those whose goal is to build more secure systems to consider the implications of their work, lest our devices become even more secure <i>against</i> us. They usually have in mind a world where everyone has full control of their devices which are then highly secure against attacks by others, and that&#x27;s a good thing; but I think it&#x27;s far more likely to turn into one where corporations have all the control and devices are secure against their owners, especially as typical users continue to choose security over freedom.",1408841999
8217332,comment,8216546,8217104,3,0,rwallace,,,"The honest answer is, unless your profession is in the physical sciences or hardware engineering, learning physics from this or other sources will probably not be <i>useful</i>.<p>Whether it&#x27;s <i>worthwhile</i> is to at least some extent a value judgment, and also as I see it, depends to some extent on what else you would have done with the time. If you have a block of time allocated for work, and you&#x27;re thinking of spending it reading about physics instead of reading documentation on something you do actually need, that&#x27;s probably suboptimal. If you&#x27;ve finished work for the day, you have a block of time allocated for intellectual leisure and you&#x27;re trying to decide between reading about physics versus, say, the latest Dungeons & Dragons rules, in my opinion the former is more worthwhile.",1408841882

Such time travel would require leaving Earth, accelerating to a relativistic velocity, travelling some distance, then accelerating back toward Earth, again reaching a relativistic velocity, then finally accelerating to match Earth&#x27;s velocity and position, and landing.<p>The argument was that although it&#x27;s true that your time will pass more slowly than time on Earth while you&#x27;re coasting, you also clearly have to do a lot of accelerating, and acceleration itself also has an effect on the apparent passage of time in your reference frame -- and in this scenario, where you start and end in Earth&#x27;s reference frame, that effect cancels out the effect of velocity (perhaps even more than cancels it out; I don&#x27;t recall).<p>Does anyone here know if this is true?",1408841430

Apologies in advance for not raising them in the proper manner. (mailing list, issue list)<p>The inventory docs is a single page.  Specifying a directory or a host file as an inventory seem to work but it&#x27;s quite unclear how the two differ in behaviour.   One problem with specifying a directory is that <i>everything</i> in the directory is interpreted; I had a README.md in there which resulted in baffling errors.<p>Dynamic inventory is also way under documented; a brief intro then two giant examples (ec2 and cobbler).  It needs a tiny &#x27;hello world&#x27;-ish example.  My first attempt produced output in &#x27;ini&#x27; format&#x27;.

So often ansible will produce error messages like &#x27;please specify an inventory&#x27; when you <i>did</i> specify an inventory.

Healthcare research seems to mean the pharmaceutical industry, and that field has been in trouble for 15 years.  The major players have been on an outsourcing  spree for the last decade, research is being gutted, and despite all that the development pipelines are not doing well.

Research is being done only at top-20 places.  Even there the money is getting tighter, at any conference you&#x27;ll go to you&#x27;ll hear that so-and-so is shutting down their lab for lack of funds.

In India, it was a country with major manpower advantage getting hit by new technology it couldn&#x27;t adopt quickly. In the US&#x27; case, it&#x27;s about a lot of countries that were competing mainly on cheap labor, and that now are catching up on technology, making the US&#x27; advantages disappear.",1408840245

So I&#x27;d be interested in getting a summary of their main claims.<p>But I do know a little about this subject and my understanding is:<p>(a) the essential claim is right that living standards in India declined in the 19th century.<p>(b) I believe this was largely caused by British interference and mismanagement. One egregious and well known example of this is the salt tax which made it more or less illegal for Indians to mine salt in India. This eventually was the catalyst for Gandhi&#x27;s salt march.<p>Another example is the British East India company raising land taxes from 10% to 60% during the great bengal famine of the 1770s. The famine caused the death of about 30% of the population of Bengal.<p>(c) Art, culture and handicrafts were a big part of the Indian economy in the pre-British era. These were primarily supported by the kings and queens of the era. The British had no interest or use for Indian arts and culture and they got rid of most of this. And most of these people fell into subsistence farming with the obvious repercussions on the rest of the economy.<p>In general, most colonized countries had this terrible scenario where the rulers could set economic policies that had no repercussion on them personally. So they focused primarily on extracting as much wealth as possible with no regard whatsoever for the consequences of these policies because <i>there were no consequences to bad governance by the colonizers</i>. And it was precisely these policies which led to most colonized economies falling into mostly subsistence farming and the inevitable economic decline. I think the figures for India are something like 40% of the population doing agriculture before the arrival of the British ending up in about 70% of the economy being just agriculture a hundred or so years later.<p>I think talk about the lack of industrialization is a big smokescreen. Lots of developed countries industrialized really late - Russia, Japan, Korea, even Germany to some extent. The difference between these countries and India is not late industrialization but colonization. Because colonization systematically drained the country of both material wealth (i.e., capital) and technology (subsistence farming doesn&#x27;t leave you with much time for educational accomplishments).",1408839122

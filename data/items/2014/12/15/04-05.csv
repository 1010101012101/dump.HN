CmpE was an interesting beast back then.<p>It seemed that the money was heavily pushing Java and that most curriculum immediately jumped to where they thought future money was.

You see, the thing is that computers behave in a certain way and languages/libraries are pretty much just tools that help you abstract away all the boilerplate associated to the many common tasks that you may want to do in a particular subject.

With each revision, though, the PLAI material gets reorganized and distributed across PAPL, so at some point it will no longer be an identifiable subset. The idea is that programming inspires new programming languages, while programming languages help us make sense of programs. Therefore, the two should be tightly intertwined. The first edition of PLAI tried one way to achieve this synthesis (but didn&#x27;t really succeed as much as I&#x27;d have liked); PAPL is a fresh attempt at getting there.",1418618440

That&#x27;s relatively expensive option, but hardly technologically infeasible. The question is only the price of each kilogram on LEO, and that goes down steadily.<p>You can use spacecraft magnetic field. An interesting area with a bunch of research to do.<p>You can speed up the way to Mars, say, from 6-8 months today to 3 months, having to spend extra fuel at launch and at arrival. For that, you can e.g. revive Nerva-style engines.<p>A combination of these (and possibly other) methods brings Mars closer even for today&#x27;s safety standards.",1418616206

Anyway it doesn&#x27;t detract from the point of my comment, which is that you only need encryption to protect from oppressive governments. He is living in a highly oppressive country, whose government makes the NSA look like Sunday school teachers.",1418616185

I would say that I find the latter group between 10x and 100x more common in my life than the former.<p>It&#x27;s even harder to find someone who will actually lift a finger to do anything about strangers being tortured, and harder still to find someone who will do more than write an angry comment online (for example, I will not do more than write comments online).<p>Although I found saraid216&#x27;s comment smug, dismissive, and non-contributing, as far as I can tell it was essentially <i>true</i>.",1418616018

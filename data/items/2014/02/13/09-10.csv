Which leads to ludicrous results when applied to real life situations. For example you got fired, or your girlfriend left you, or your friend/relative died. What a terrible day!

7230497,comment,7229730,7229730,4,0,oleganza,,,"The root of the problem is inability to pin pubkey directly to a DNS record which is changeable only by the owner of the private key. If there was a single place where any client can check which PK owns which name and trust derived SSL certificates from there, then the end user UI would be simpler and safer altogether.<p>Suggestion: a protocol to register names on Bitcoin blockchain. You can securely transfer ownership of a name, securely associate more metadata with it etc. Every client can independently check if a given certificate for a given domain name is issued by a proper owner, not by one of opaque organizations that you just have to trust.<p>Today personal computers are bundled with hundreds of root certificates. If one is compromised by FBI or Mossad, they can impersonate FB or Google no problem. DNS records can be taken from you and/or censored, DNS servers spoofed etc.<p>Combining SSL with decentralized DNS-on-blockchain is just so logical. BTW, Namecoin is not the best attempt because it requires separate blockchain. People want one, the most powerful, most robust blockchain and we should pin all our metadata right there. The real problem is how to organize socially, how to agree that this particular protocol with that distribution of names is The Name System, while all others are cheap clones.",1392285527

7230483,comment,7222313,7225190,1,0,jude-,,,"First, the boundary between Linux and the rest of the system is very well-defined.  I can run my userspace on top of multiple different kernels, since my userspace is loosely coupled to Linux (yes, there are exceptions, but not so many that it prevents GNU/kfreebsd or GNU/solaris from working, for example).  This is not the case with systemd, which over the past several years has been subsuming larger and larger swaths of userspace, introducing all sorts of tight couplings and inter-dependencies that weren&#x27;t there before.<p>Second, the pace of innovation in Linux is definitely slower  than in userspace, and getting your patches adopted is more difficult relative to most userspace programs (this is the high barrier to entry I spoke of).  Your patches either have to get approved by Linus et al., or you have to host them out-of-tree and hope your users know how to apply them and compile the kernel themselves (and if you want to do this for them, you have to do it for every kernel you need to support).  If you&#x27;re lucky, your patches can be isolated into a kernel module, in which case you &quot;only&quot; need to keep it up-to-date with the kernel API (which is a moving target).<p>Contrast this to working on a program like, say, xinetd.  While the option for submitting patches still reduces to &quot;go through the maintainer&quot; or &quot;host them yourself&quot;, the &quot;host them yourself&quot; option is much more tenable, since the codebase is smaller, and the &quot;don&#x27;t break userspace&quot; policy Linus enforces ensures you aren&#x27;t coupled to a moving-target API.  The lower barrier to entry brought on by loose coupling explains why Gentoo can get away with forking udev, but not large swaths of the Linux kernel.<p>Systemd has the effect of making innovation in the plumbing layer (xinetd, syslog, udev, cron, etc.) a lot like innovation in the Linux kernel.  Can you imagine the absurdity of having to maintain a version of xinetd for each separate systemd API change?",1392285255

7230342,comment,7229534,7229974,1,0,bad_user,,,"I once worked on a project that pivoted the business logic so many times, with one hack after another, that technical debt went through the roof - at which point it became next to impossible to further evolve it. Because of legacy and tight coupling, simple features would take longer and longer to implement. And because the architecture was completely based on assumptions of low traffic that would grow organically (it was a web service), the shit really hit the fan when we started getting tens of thousands of requests per second, again because the architecture was so bad that it seemed as any optimization we did was worthless and actually made matters worse. The web service actually had to be stopped for a while, because as a startup we couldn&#x27;t afford to rent a thousand frontend servers and even if we did, you&#x27;re only moving the problem up the chain, which in our case was the data storage and again, because of tight coupling, it was unfeasible to move it to something that scales horizontally.<p>So the solution was to basically rebuild this web service from scratch. This decision also came with business logic simplifications - as we realized that certain features were unfeasible at that scale, so many features ended up being dropped based on technical considerations. Which IMHO was OK, because the best way to approach problem solving is to build <i>less</i> and sometimes we end up building features instead of solving the problem that we set out to solve in the first place.<p>I wish I could say that our initial approach allowed us to iterate fast. But it didn&#x27;t. I was there from the start, I&#x27;ve built the prototypes, I did the pivots, I made all the wrong choices, I managed the team that came after and I could&#x27;ve made all the right choices without sacrificing fast iterations. All it takes is experience and tools that do &quot;the right thing&quot; in regards to your problem, without sacrificing productivity - being able to recognize the best tool for the job, being able to simplify problems, being able to tell the <i>cost</i> of something - now those are traits of good software developers.<p>The article does have a point though - you can learn all day about tools, best practices, algorithms, paradigms or whatnot, but in the end the goal isn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t be to write &quot;beautiful code&quot;, but rather to produce artifacts for solving problems that people have.",1392283074

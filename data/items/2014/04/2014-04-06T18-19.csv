Several applications out there (e.g. Mailtracker, Streak, etc.) provide tracking capabilities that include details on the recipient’s location, device, and number of opens. We at Pluto decided to only track the time that the email was first opened because we calculate some expiration times based on when the message was opened (e.g. email expires 1 hour after open). If we did not display this information, the user could always calculate it anyway from the email’s time of expiration.<p>David and I are both concerned about privacy, however, so we may implement an option to obscure tracking details in the future.<p>Lindsay, \nCo-Founder @ Pluto Mail",1396810705

It is a mainstream opinion. Stormfront is a fringe group. Eich does not seem to belong to any other extreme group.

It&#x27;s very important to keep this in mind especially with issues like prop8 where the anti-prop8 branded the prop8 supporters as a whole as gay-hating bigots.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: we don&#x27;t know where Eich fell on the spectrum.

Some applications use functionality that&#x27;s tied to X even if they use a toolkit that supports Wayland. The compatibility solution is XWayland. This is a simple X server that can be launched on demand, allocates a Wayland buffer per X window and then renders into that buffer (this is similar to how XQuartz works on OS X, except with more on-demand activation).<p>So, other than bugs, things should be pretty transparent.

If you stream it, you have to be able to seek to the position in the song that everyone else is at so you can add more devices dynamically. You couldn&#x27;t just stream whatever your phone is listening to (e.g. pandora) because it would add latency to the other clients&#x27; players and it would sound out of sync. The exception is if your player actually cached the sound data coming out of pandora, created a 10 second buffer, and started playing it &quot;late&quot;, so the other clients would have enough lead time to buffer the song and start playing in sync.<p>Once you have resolved how to distribute the sound, you have to establish synchronization with all the clients. Ways to do that:<p>* Ship an ntp client with the app. Downside: network latency, firewalls.<p>* Synchronize nearby players by playing a loud tone four times, allowing clients to sync to the tone. Downside: latency of speed of sound, can only do once (otherwise someone has to play tones in the middle of your song to sync a new client)<p>* Listen to a track already playing, analyze own song&#x27;s structure, find that point in the song, start from there. Downside: must already have decent portion (or all of) the song to seek to the correct positions. (Possible solution: implementation of rolling checksum/deltas?)<p>* Child clients buffer the song data from the parent client. Assuming the parent has slept N time before playing, communicate with the parent to discover what point the parent is streaming from now, download its 10 second buffer, and start playing at the correct point once synced with parent. Downside: must do all of that (network establishment, sync with parent, download buffer, start play) within 10 seconds or the buffer will be out of sync. Possibly do a 60 second buffer?<p>If your remote host just has all the song data, you could also just record a few seconds of whatever&#x27;s playing around you, discover the song in your remote host&#x27;s database, sync to the sound you&#x27;re hearing, and seek, stream and play it. That would probably be the easiest thing, assuming your remote server had whatever song was playing. Possible to index local songs too.",1396808658

Cannon was anti-gay-marriage, we don&#x27;t know whether that was the motivating factor for Mr. Yagan&#x27;s donation.  It could have been for some other reason: perhaps Mr. Cannon helped him or his company in some way, or perhaps Mr. Cannon&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s views (relating to things other than gay marriage) were more objectionable to Mr. Yagan than Mr. Cannon&#x27;s were.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that this donation occurred in 2004, when few politicians openly supported gay marriage, and most publicly said they were against it.<p>Politicians have views on all sorts of matters, some of which we agree with and some of which we don&#x27;t, and most of us aren&#x27;t single-issue voters.  A donation to a politician is not strong evidence of the donor&#x27;s agreement with all of the views of that politician.

According to the mob you&#x27;re either a saint or a bigot, and thus Eich&#x27;s value as a human being was supposedly entirely determined by this one opinion he voiced in 2008.<p>I&#x27;m staunchly in favor of gay marriage, which I consider to be a no-brainer -- but it seems to me the motivations of Prop 8 proponents differ a lot in nature, with some being much more excusable than others in their wrongness.<p>For example, there are people who have nothing against homosexuality but are attached to the symbolic value of &#x27;marriage&#x27; as a Christian institution and would be completely fine with another civil contract with the same rights but a different name. This seems to be somewhat in line with Eich&#x27;s actions (I remember reading a memo from Eich stating he had no plan to amend Mozilla&#x27;s gay-friendly policies and employee benefits). Although I still think this view is guilty of being wrongly attached to outdated models of society, this is not nearly as bad as what Eich has been accused of.<p>There are other possible reasons one could have (for example, those who in ignorance of the many studies that showed that children of homosexual households grow up just fine could have unfounded reservations about gay adoption, but would be ready to change their mind if shown the evidence; I&#x27;ve encountered a couple myself), but my broader point is that there is a huge range in the degree of bigotry between those who voted Prop 8 and one should not jump to conclusions so easily as they do not all deserve the same level of condemnation.<p>Now, I can understand why Eich&#x27;s views <i>could</i> make him unsuitable as a CEO because, in a purely pragmatic sense, holding views that most of your workforce despise is obviously detrimental to your ability to lead and especially so at such a peculiar organization as Mozilla where ideology matters arguably more than in other companies; it also matters because, as many have said, a CEO is the face of the company and his views and those of the company are sometimes hard to disentangle.<p>But going from there to making a call to boycott Firefox is a <i>huge</i> jump and smells like a pure appropriation of the controversy for PR purposes. This revelation about Sam Yagan seems to strengthen this feeling. Come on people, we&#x27;re better than this. Being on the right side of history about an issue does not automatically waive us from intellectual rigor and moderation.",1396808199

While he may have disagreed in private, his public persona was inclusive and friendly. There are multiple testominies from people that never knew he harbored wishes to limit their rights before the controversy came out. Even the LGBTQ* Mozilla employees/volunteers spoke up to say this. Meanwhile, in Montana/Utah, if the CEO learns you&#x27;re gay, you&#x27;re likely to be found dead in the middle of the night.<p>But the mob had already formed, and they wanted blood. Blood is what they got. And the Mozilla project suffers as a result.<p>The Eich story, and the lynch mob that followed it, permanantly reduced my respect for HN. While I would not ever donate to a campaign (let alone one that denied equal rights to human beings), this made the gay community of HN (and their supporters) look like easily-influenced livestock. I used to click on the HN comments link before actually clicking the story it was about, because I could rely on the spin being kept to a minimum. I no longer have that guarantee. Similarly, I no longer have the guarantee of fair discourse, and fully expect future comments to be downvoted to oblivion (much like reddit) when one has a dissenting opinion. If someone says you hate gay people (correctly or not), the HN community has proven they will prosecute before a proper inquiry has been made.<p>Even more disturbing, I have now learned that the militant LGBTQ* members in Silicon Valley are just as easily-influenced, and as easily driven to boycott, as members of Stormfront, or the AFA, or the PMRC. This seems to be such a big issue in the Silicon Valley that I&#x27;m now solid in my decision to stay out of SV for any new startup ventures.

Neither do you.<p>It might have been family pressure, it might have honestly been that he&#x27;s religious and doesn&#x27;t believe the word &quot;marriage&quot; can be applied to same sex couple (who had Domestic partnerships available in California, which provide the same legal rights as marriage, so I find the &quot;second class citizen&quot; argument entirely lacking.

Hell, maybe mozilla even benefited from the donation in ways that aren&#x27;t clear (and they didn&#x27;t want to put out in the media) You just don&#x27;t fucking know.

Eich very directly donated towards a cause that was bent on restricting my rights. Though fear often breeds hatred, I truly don&#x27;t bear Eich ill will. I&#x27;m not happy to see him lose his job--on the contrary, I share your sadness that a talented, qualified man lost his job. However, I am relieved that a man who feels that I should not be allowed to marry is no longer in a very influential position at an influential company.<p>Now, whether or not OkCupid should have been casting stones is another matter.

I am the furthest thing from a node.js fanboy, but as a build pipeline it is awesome.<p>Being able to have a gulpfile take care of compiling jade, coffeescript and sass, triggering live reloads, etc., immediately makes me smile.  As a former-Flex developer who dealt with some heinous build-times because the tooling was worth it, I now have a better front-end alternative with sub-quarter-second build times.<p>And if you have a json-serving backend (rails, spray.io, whatever) you can set up easy double tests of your front-end logic, where you mock out the backend, and then run slower &quot;integration&quot; tests where you include it.  Might sound wacky but I&#x27;ve found this to be a way to quickly develop robust systems.  For me, angular&#x27;s dependency-injection makes it even easier.<p>So this static-koolaid took a while for me to drink, but I&#x27;m liking it more all the time.",1396807460

Wayland is (probably) still years from getting adopted even by &quot;bleeding-edge&quot; distributions like Arch.<p>Your everyday experience shouldn&#x27;t get affected, hopefully. Wayland removes a lot of legacy from X, but their end result is pretty much the same, &quot;display some stuff on my screen&quot;. And XWayland should assure this, since you&#x27;ll be able to run applications that don&#x27;t support X on Wayland in a seamless way. Most applications use some toolkit anyway (gtk, qt) that are getting ported to Wayland, so the author of that applications shouldn&#x27;t do any changes to make it work on Wayland (beside recompiling it).<p>At best, Wayland should be lighter than X, and it should fix tearing if you have some now (but this is already fixed by modern wm, at least on my computer).<p>One of the biggest change that you shouldn&#x27;t notice is security, X has tons of holes (every application can read/write into another application), which wayland fix (see here for more: <a href=""http://mupuf.org/blog/2014/02/19/wayland-compositors-why-and-how-to-handle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mupuf.org/blog/2014/02/19/wayland-compositors-why-and...</a>).<p>Same for Mir (but I dunno about the security issues that Wayland fixes), but upstream doesn&#x27;t seems willing to accept Mir-specific patches, so Canonical might end with having to patch applications/toolkit/drivers downstream (but the user shouldn&#x27;t notice any difference anyway).",1396807356

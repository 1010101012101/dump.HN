82545,comment,82477,82492,0,0,oditogre,,,">Grunge-Retro Fonts<p>I was actually thinking a lot of the examples had an almost steampunk vibe to them.  Others remind me of some of the music videos that came out in 2002 - 2005, when emo bands started playing with goth themes.  I can't say I'm a fan of the cluttered clip art look or the 'stains' / Rorschach inkblots, but a lot of the other stuff I could really get behind.  Reading dense text on bright backgrounds really sucks after a while, and having a few rough edges or variations in texture and colors keeps the eyes awake.  I'd even be happy if more sites went to having a slightly darker background in the areas where text is like news.yc does (instead of solid white like Reddit).",1195674245

You have a set of new features that are being requested by some users.<p>Seems to me that the obvious solution is to bundle all of these new features, create a ""premium account"", and charge a monthly fee to those who wish to upgrade.<p>Voila!",1195673433
82542,comment,82536,82539,0,0,e1ven,,,"SPP is the right way to do that.<p>The problem comes in that users will look at it and say ""What if only 200 of the 400 people donate? Then I wasted my money..""<p>SPP basically promises that they'll get the money back, if they don't reach the threshold. If only 200 people donate, then I'll refund everyone, and no harm done.<p>The other alternative is taking ""Pledges"" and only collecting once you have enough to make it worthwhile, but I recommend against this. The problem is that if it takes a while, people might forget they agreed, or might not come back, etc.<p>One final alternative is to collect their credit card information and pledge number, but only charge them if you hit the threshold for implementing the feature. There is then a risk they might forget and chargeback, or their card might expire.<p>",1195673425
82541,comment,82423,82505,0,0,edu,,,"It sounds quite interesting, a real time bet system. The toughest would be to develop some kind of broadcasting system compatible with games made by different vendors and running on different platforms (i.e. bet on UT, on Halo, on strategy games, sports games...), and there maybe some legal problems with the vendors but if there's money everybody can agree.

Remember that the average web surfer has the attention span of a caffeinated squirrel and if you carpet bomb their visual cortex with too much stuff, no matter how pretty it all may be, if a web surfer doesn't immediately understand what they are looking at, they get confused and turn away.

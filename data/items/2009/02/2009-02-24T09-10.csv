492848,comment,492730,492730,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"With the exception of 2 & 8 this list basically boils down to ""they have poor management skills""<p>I'm not one who is opposed to the young founder who starts a company right out of school but startups need to seek out someone with actual experience as soon as possible imho.  Steve Jobs (John Sculley) and Bill Gates (Jon Shirley) both did it.<p>Ideally a successful startup can combine the energy and fresh insight of a young founder with the experience and management skills of a seasoned businessman.",1235469165
492847,comment,492744,492744,0,0,derefr,,,"As a writer myself, I consume these sort of guides religiously, but they always have a journalistic bent; fiction rarely seems to be considered. [1] This is usually excused by these guide-writers with a remark that ""there's no one true way to tell a story well.""<p>Indeed, there are <i>many</i> ways, perhaps an infinite number, but there are just as many ways to tell a story badly, and it would be helpful to at least ponder upon <i>some</i> of them, rather than telling each author to start from scratch. I'd love to see a guide that just works through the corpus of the standard set of famous authors, and points out the various choices of narrative construction and prosody they made along the way.<p>Sadly, not even the university courses I took <i>on this specific subject</i> did this well; they seemed more to be ""here, look at this author; he writes well, does he not? You should read him, and perhaps osmose what he knows, somehow."" This is not the scientific method; we do not teach people about gravity by repeatedly dropping things on them. We experiment with variations, seeing how each change affects some variable--in this case, the experience of reading--and then declare that some or another technique has certain statistical effects on readers.<p>---<p>[1] Fiction is not orthogonal to HN--narratives in general, and the allegory in particular, can be just as valid methods of information delivery as plain speech--but that's another rant.",1235469102

I've never heard of Meez before this article and I'm taking that as my friends haven't either.<p>Reading the article it states that Meez overtakes Facebook on number of minutes per visit. Thats not really a good unit of measurement. Especially since facebook can largely be managed by reading your email or other tools and then logging in only to send a reply.",1235468731

Things start at 1, steps start at 0.<p>But starting at 0 presents a problem. If I have a set of stairs with 5 steps, I either count the ground or the landing in my steps but never both. If I want to get to the middle (3rd) step, if I'm at the bottom I just count 1, 2, 3 steps and I'm there, but if I'm at the top I only count 2 steps down. There are really 6 positions I could be, but only 5 steps. You guys may have this down, but it still trips me up sometimes.",1235467755

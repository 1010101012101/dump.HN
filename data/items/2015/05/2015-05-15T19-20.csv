What are we going to do when we need drone infrastructure? What about high speed internet and fiber in a constant upgrading capacity? Is our solution to continually fall behind waiting for the market to be right?<p>Why don&#x27;t we have the same grand efforts to build an electric highway (highways with electric charging stations), or better high speed rail not 50 year old Amtrak trains, or that killer fiber network.  These are quality of life improvements, that directly increase economic power for all, that we cannot get funding for but we can go to war.<p>We need a War on Infrastructure Aging and somehow tie it to War on Terror funding or War on Drugs funding and scare people into doing it as that seems to be our modus operandi this millennia.",1431719940

9553219,comment,9550094,9550094,0,0,e12e,,,"Very nice guide, but a couple of things:<p>1) No mention of full-disk encryption on both machines. This is trivial, and especially with flash-storage I consider it mandatory. There&#x27;s hardly any reason <i>not</i> to do fde.<p>This protects data at rest, and makes the system(s) somewhat tamper proof. You&#x27;re still counting on the BIOS and keyboard to be safe (not booting into a vm, no hardware keylogger) -- but at least it makes it a little harder to compromise the system.<p>One could use/add the neo passphrase to the boot procedure, but it is easy to copy (just get hold of the neo, plug it in, push button) -- and there&#x27;s no way to know the key has been compromised.<p>With a manually entered pass phrase, the input path needs to be compromised (eg: hardware key logger). In many theat scenarios the two are similar -- but there&#x27;s a difference between someone lifting the yubikey for 10 seconds when you&#x27;re passed out at a party, and someone breaking-and-entering to your apartment and installing a hw key logger/bios back door etc.<p>2) I&#x27;ve been running FDE/LUKS on my laptop(s) -- and have been considering to add a passphrase on an usb dongle (I don&#x27;t have a yubikey neo, and my old yubikey II that I got as a promo seem to have stopped working, the button does nothing -- not sure why). This is a trade-off, as anything else.<p>The constraint of having to be able to type in a pass phrase blindly (and quickly), does not mix well with having a pass phrase that is at least equivalent to a 128 bit random key. If you just want a random phrase of lower-case letters (easier to touch type, don&#x27;t have to remember where capital letters go/avoid errors with shift) you need ~28 random characters (with a set of ~67 characters, you get down to ceiling(128/log2(67))=22 -- with more room for errors while typing)).<p>Another thing, is that any such &quot;unlocked&quot; key needs manual intervention to be removed. So if someone steals your laptop and your yubi/usb-key with a static passphrase/key -- they can be expected to gain access, and you can&#x27;t do anything about it.<p>This is of course true if they capture your pass phrase with a keylogger before stealing the laptop as well (I wonder a bit about this account[1] from the DPR case -- if it is misinformation of incompetence -- but I&#x27;d assume the smartest thing to do was a sneak-and-peak warrant installing a hw key logger (or just a camera) in order to make sure that they had most of the passwords/pass phrases. Seems strange that they weren&#x27;t able to obtain probable cause for that).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-2/</a> (If TL;DR search for library)",1431719588

Once you&#x27;ve done something that has a public impact, or even, involved in something that is now in the public attention, a U.S. news organization can make the case that information about you is of public interest.<p>Take the Amtrak engineer in the recent Philadelphia crash...as far as I can tell, he most definitely would like to remain out of the spotlight. Yet, because he happened to be the engineer at the time of the crash -- whether or not we know that he directly or even indirectly contributed to the crash -- news orgs have some legal protection in scrutinizing his life, including where he went to school, his job history, and any public social media postings.<p>Sometimes privacy is accorded out of tradition or convention...for example, the identity of a rape victim who is testifying in a court case is public information, though it is rarely reported except under special circumstances. But in this case, the victim did not intentionally put themselves in this position of public interest, but because court cases are considered to be important for the public to know about, the victim&#x27;s identity is considered public information.<p>It should be said that nothing is completely cut and dry, there&#x27;s always a tension between the public&#x27;s right to know and privacy. But the right of privacy is usually afforded to victims and for people whom public exposure would cause greater harm than censorship -- i.e. the identity of witnesses in a state case.

But there are cooler things, like being able to implement units in the type system. Rust also gets safety right in the sense that its defaults are good - its primary random number library has ChaChaRng and IsaacRng instead of a Mersenne Twister, for example.<p>The sensible library design goes everywhere, from Rust&#x27;s functional roots, high-quality zero-overhead iteration protocol (none of the mess that C++ gives you) to simple things like a well-designed composable hashing standard.<p>Even stuff like comparing C++&#x27;s move, copy and constructor semantics are much nicer in Rust, and in most cases even lower overhead: everything is a memcpy and is implemented automatically.<p>I can go on.

This is pointed out in the article.<p>As I read the piece, it sounded like the swim coach was fantastic. Here&#x27;s what stood out to me:<p>> The instructor treated me like I was an Olympic swimmer. He smiled and nodded and gave me a thumbs up and said, “You’re getting it! You’re getting it! You just need a little practice in the water, and you’ll be more comfortable.”<p>> Since I was nowhere near comfortable enough to do that, I had my own set of confidence-building exercises in a lone, separate corner of the pool. One of the lifeguards noticed what was going on and offered to help out. She offered me items like floaters—which the class normally did not use—and kept at me with different small exercises I could try.<p>(Granted, this isn&#x27;t entirely the coach. But it&#x27;s the best situation this guy could have landed in.)<p>>  I realized I was in the middle of nowhere, and panicked. My legs suddenly seemed thrice heavier. I flopped into the water, kept trying to stand because I was tall enough to, but the fins kept slipping beneath me, and I kept striking the water, and trying to stand, and falling and trying to stand, and falling and trying to stand, again and again, drinking water, inhaling it, panicking. After a tortured fifteen seconds—I think, it felt longer—I was able to stand, and I made it, by walking not swimming, shivering and utterly terrified, to the end of the pool from which I had kicked off. “I almost drowned!” I screamed at the instructor, breathing heavily. He laughed and shook his head. “Not even close. No one drowns in my pool. Good job.” Good job…did he really mean that? He seemed to.<p>> And at the end of it all, I got the swim credit.<p>> The swim requirement became a thing far behind me, hazy in memory. But sometimes, I go to the Z-Center, and I step into the pool, and swim around.<p>I&#x27;ve taught a few people to juggle (the standard three-ball pattern), another physical skill, and this struck me as quite similar. Nobody worries that if they mess up while learning to juggle they&#x27;ll suddenly die. But almost everyone comes into it with their own idea of what failure means, and it has to be stamped out. To a novice, you&#x27;ve failed if you drop the balls. As coach, I can demonstrate the proper throwing technique, describe exactly what&#x27;s going on, model it in front of them in slow motion as they hold their hands in the correct position, and (almost) everyone still makes the same mistake when they try to throw two balls: they&#x27;ll throw the first ball, and then quickly hand off the second ball from one hand to the other while the first ball is in the air. That feels right to them, because they don&#x27;t drop the balls, but it&#x27;s wrong. You have to throw the second ball upward just like the first one. And so I learned that the right teaching technique is to jump in with effusive praise as soon as they do <i>anything</i> other than quickly hand off the ball to the other hand. Handing off the ball is bad, even if you can keep it going indefinitely. Did you panic and drop the second ball? Excellent. Did you throw the second ball behind yourself? Great work. Did you throw the second ball into the first ball? That&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for. All of those things can be fixed, and with practice, they will be.<p>Sometimes the best thing a coach can say is &quot;great work, that&#x27;s better than you&#x27;ve done before, keep trying&quot;.",1431719057

This ended up being implemented and officially accredited as an ActiveX control, and for the longest time there was no framework in place to accredit other implementations. Mozilla actually implemented SEED in the hopes it might be helpful, but ended up dropping it again later. This situation remains unsolved until now, although every couple of months there&#x27;s a news story of supposed gov plans to do to better soon.",1431719034

You can&#x27;t say that I &quot;literally&quot; said you don&#x27;t like abstraction at all, as that&#x27;s not what I am arguing: if anything, I am arguing that, due to the blub paradox, seeing the difference between the automation you encourage and the automation you have a distaste for is complex at best and impossible at worst; I look at your article and, as I have every other time I have examined Rust, am left wanting for more abstraction and automation when it comes to errors.<p>Your argument that you do not want error propagation to be implicit is strange to me, as a developer who is used to this being automatic, because it is does not affect safety to automate and is effectively nothing but boilerplate. There is nothing different in the form of your argument against exceptions from the form of the arguments made by developers of C or Go or Java against adding features like templates or optionals or macros. It isn&#x27;t that Java developers hate abstraction in all forms (that would be an absurd argument that I would need to pull from an AbsurdArgumentFactory ;P), it is that the form of argument that we often hear from all of these developers about the features we like in languages like C++ or Rust or D has the same core structure :(.<p>On pcwalton&#x27;s notes on exceptions, I already responded to him in my comment that started my involvement in this thread, and went further in my first reply this morning: his mental model seems stuck in the implementation of exceptions as defined by Java and as used by Java developers. His datapoint for why they are so slow is from an old story about gcj: the Java exception model requires a stacktrace reification, and you would not be able to replicate that kind of performance loss in C++, even though they share the same implementation of propagation. His API issues are all (as argued by others) based on the awkward way that Java developers have made exceptions used for things that aren&#x27;t really errors.<p>Have you developed in Erlang? This is a language that considers errors and failures to be the core problem faced by developers, and which has structured almost all other decisions surrounding that core premise. After spending a lot of time coding in Erlang a few years ago, it fundamentally changed the way I think about errors, and that was after over 20 years of software development in languages like C++ and Java. When I was (comparatively) green and naive, back in 2001, I even made an argument <i>for</i> checked exceptions to Microsoft in C# (it was partly my argument for RAII in that same thread that got us the using syntax sugar for IDisposable): that is how far I had to come in the subsequent decade.<p>Erlang has the right abstraction: a mechanism for exceptions that is designed somewhat similarly to panic, in that it encourages you to structure your code in ways that isolate failures behind processes and avoid ever &quot;handling&quot; errors, but which lets you propagate and augment rich error context through multiple process layers implicitly, making error propgation automatic and without boilerplate. Once you &quot;get it&quot;, you can do this easily in any language that has unchecked exceptions (even Java, using RuntimeException as the new exception root, but you have to really hate Java to pull his off ;P), as function calls can be mentally modeled as calls through process linkages (though you sadly then can&#x27;t use the standard libraries provided by any of these languages, as they are all built with a broken model :().<p>Given how many other amazing things that Rust got uniquely right, it is somewhere between disappointing and devastating that error propagation, something which is so important, only seems to be competing with languages (like C, Go, or Java) where errors are almost unworkable :(.",1431718750

Erik&#x27; quotes are all taken from <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/8eUxiibm_zA/CGbTaZqe610J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/8eUxiibm_zA/C...</a>:<p>> [...] is INTENDED to be a MODIFIER for FOO and NOT part of the CONTENT that FOO is marking up<p>&quot;The intended use has less to do with it than the notion that you can
  define what is meta-information and what is information at the time you
  want to decide whether something goes in an attribute or a sub-element.
  My argument is that this is impossible.  Whether it is meta-information
  or information is a reflection of the actual use, not the intended use.<p>However, given that the mechanism was created, and I will argue that it
  was not so much created as it was never thought possible to be any other
  way, it was used to define several language properties.  &quot;Now that we
  have this, would it not also be nice to have that.&quot;  This means that
  several of the attribute types grew very far apart from the contents of
  sub-elements and you sort of &quot;had&quot; to use them as attributes, but only
  sort of, because the application can and does define the semantics of
  everything, and if you want ID and IDREF, you can make the same choice as
  you would in Common Lisp to use symbols or a hash tables of strings.&quot;<p>> Actually, let me try to be excruciatingly precise: my claim is that it is not self-evident that a syntactic distinction between data and metadata is useless. Hence a rendering of XML into sexprs that preserves this distinction is defensible, and dismissing it in the pejorative terms that Erik uses is not justified.<p>&quot;No, there is nothing that requires there to be element attributes as a
  distinct concept from element contents.  There are, however, a number of
  practical things that follow from making that arbitrar distinction which
  can look like rationales, but if you ask yourself &quot;why can it not be a
  subelement&quot;, there are no real answers, only appeals to the idea that
  there somehow __have to be a distinction.  It took me years to figure out
  that the whole attribute idea is completely vacuous, and I worked with
  the creator of SGML himself for several years on several SGML-related
  standards and projects.  I started writing &quot;A conceptual introduction to
  SGML&quot; back in 1994, but as I had pained my way through five chapters, I
  had to realize that it was all wrong.  There was a basic design mistake
  in the whole language framework.  That mistake is that simply put: &quot;what
  is good enough for the users of the language is not good enough for its
  creators&quot;.  Each and every level of &quot;containership&quot; in SGML has its own
  syntax, optimized for the task.  Each and every level has a different
  syntax for &quot;the writing on the box&quot; as opposed to &quot;the contents of the
  box&quot;.  This follows from a very simple, yet amazingly elusive principle
  in its design: Meta-data is conceptually incompatible with data.  This is
  in fact wrong.  Meta-data is only data viewed from a different angle, and
  vice versa.  SGML forces you to remain loyal to your chosen angle of view.&quot;<p>So, the opinion seems to be that the arbitrary structure you put between meta-data and data at the moment you create data is not necessarly well-suited for people using your data: then, despite being useful, the syntactic distinction becomes an annoyance.<p>By the way, Erik&#x27;s dissmissal is (1) the result of years of experience working on SGML, and (2) not pejorative, but argumented. <i>He</i> is the one arguing against the &quot;self-evidence&quot; of attributes.",1431718566

It is what there is. It can’t be created for it is that within which all creations unfold.<p>> If something is fundamentally beyond all forms of experience, direct or indirect, it might as well not exist. Because all knowledge resides in consciousness, we cannot know what is supposedly outside consciousness;<p>Just because there are limitations on our own ability to perceive the physical world does not mean that there is a fundamental limit on what can be perceived. For example, the Hubble space telescope can perceive light that is beyond both the ability of us to observe inside of our atmosphere and the wavelengths which we can see with our own eyes.<p>>According to my system, reality unfolds in one stream of subjectivity that I call ‘mind-at-large.’<p>>As such, what we call ‘conscious entities’ are merely dissociated alters of mind-at-large. An image of that dissociation is a human body.<p>>Therefore, our feeble attempts to engineer an entity with a private, subjective inner life similar to our own aren’t really attempts to create consciousness. Instead, they are attempts to induce dissociation in mind-at-large, so to create alters analogous to ourselves.<p>After creating a veil that is unpierceable by human cognition, the author conveniently hides his metaphysical &quot;mind-at-large&quot; creation behind it. It is as if some great mind is doling out consciousness to each animal according to its share. Because we are but fragments, mere images of this great mind we can never hope to be able to recreate anything more than cheap reproductions. Sound familiar?<p>> Going further down the chain of biological complexity, it isn’t unreasonable to infer that metabolism itself – that process common to all life – is the most basic image of dissociative processes in mind-at-large.<p>Engineers design chemical processes that harness chemical energy broken up into individual steps to produce some useful product, just like metabolism does. Indeed, chemical engineers use enzymes in some of their steps. In fact, there is even work on creating artificial metabolisms. We are better at replicating this mind-at-large better than the author is aware.<p>>Based on this understanding, do we have any reason whatsoever to believe that the mere mimicking of the information flow in human brains, no matter how accurate, will ever lead to a new dissociation of mind-at-large? The answer to this question can only be ‘yes’ if you think the kidney simulation can make the computer urinate.<p>False equivalence much? Creation of a physical substance from thin air is impossible. However, given the right inputs, the Cloaca machine can create poop from food by simulating the digestive process.<p>*edit - formatting",1431718389

9553045,comment,9551510,9552878,0,0,mglinski,,,"Also IANAL but from what I know the law has not been interpreted to use (in my opinion) a reasonable definition of the word effective. The law requires 2 things here for a covered protection to be &quot;effective&quot;:<p><pre><code>  #1 That the protection on the copy is &quot;sufficient&quot; to protect the rights of a copyright holder of the original work, and

  #2 That the copyright owner is satisfied with the protection provided by the copied work.
</code></pre>
To me at least, this seems insane. You can theoretically claim DCMA based relief for anything forever by taking its bitstream format and flipping every bit once. That coupled with the knowledge of the copyright owner will be enough to be covered under this reading of &quot;effective&quot;.<p>The linked court decision states on page 28:<p>98. To prevail on a DMCA claim for violation of the copy-control provision, plaintiff must
show that CSS “effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under” the DMCA. 17 U.S.C. §
1201(b)(1). Under that section, a technological measure “effectively protects a right of a copyright
owner . . . if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise
limits the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.” 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(2)(B). For
the reasons articulated above, the court finds that CSS technology is an effective technological
measure to prevent copying of copyrighted DVD content by the average consumer. That CSS
technology has been hacked does not disturb this conclusion.<p>The RealNetworks case where this was decided is linked below. The case basically went &quot;There is this program that uses freely available code that technically breaks your DCMA approved protection method, CSS, but because CSS still works to protect rights due to the breadth of it&#x27;s implementation, it is not sufficiently broken by your program or the freely available knowledge you used to make it, and the Court finds for the Plaintiff.&quot; (my interpretation from reading page 56)<p>See: <a href=""https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/RealDVD/real_v_dvd-cca_pi_order_081109.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/RealDVD/real_v_dvd-cca_pi...</a><p>Pages #28 and #56",1431718067

The point is that those data-binds <i>only</i> propagate if you perform all the same selections on your update as you did during enter stage. I reported this issue and they essentially said it can&#x27;t be improved due to backwards-compatibility requirements[1]<p>And key functions are non-trivial to create if 1. you use d3.nest[2] (not to be confused with nested selections) 2. you modify the data in a way that changes the grouping 3. you try to match existing nodes back to the changed groupings. Key-based computation is insufficient for dynamically matching DOM nodes to changing sets.<p>Those two things aren&#x27;t showstoppers. They just make the data-binding fairly brittle.<p>The thing that it&#x27;s bound to a non-namespaced __data__ property is more problematic in my opinion since you always have to pay attention to not overwrite the datum with a different selection on any DOMnode, otherwise you will break callbacks that rely on the data. It basically requires a 1:1 correspondence for DOM to data on the whole subtree.<p>This makes decomposing the selections into separate steps difficult. I.e. building a base tree and then populating the leaves with a separate data set can easily end up overwriting the data bindings of the base tree.
Again, it&#x27;s possible to avoid these pitfalls but if __data__ had been namespaced it would be far less hazardous.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/2034"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/2034</a>

But when you work with other people it will be a problem.  You will get the reputation of being unreliable, and a reputation once acquired is almost impossible to shift.  Even devs end up interacting with other people.  If you&#x27;re any good, people will start coming to ask your opinion on things.

But once you are a member of a team, even if you don&#x27;t formally interact with people in the code you&#x27;re writing, you still have knowledge and experience that other people might want or need to tap into.  If you&#x27;re not there, you&#x27;re depriving them of the ability to interact with you.  Interactions in a team are not limited to formal meetings and formal pairings.

Try getting a seat on bart at 24th st for most of the day.  Or sometimes even getting on the busses in upper haight during commute hours.<p>As for cars, well, the difference between nyc and sf is that in the former, you can live without a car, and in sf, it is very difficult to live an adult life without a car.  To list off many examples re sf: there are huge holes in public transportation, both temporally, safety wise (particularly for a petite woman), and geographically; there is not the same delivery culture for takeout, or laundry; grocery stores are far away from many places and don&#x27;t deliver, though instacart helps some; there often aren&#x27;t gyms or other services in reasonable (10 min) walking distance for large chunks of the city.  We lived car-free in nyc and needed at least one car in sf.  And once you have that car, and commit to the $600-$800/mo it costs, then you want to use it.  Part of the reason to put up with occasional public transport headaches in nyc is you&#x27;re saving the cost of a car.  My take on public transport in sf is it would be worth it if the idiots that run what is, after all, a very rich city got their act together and improved public transport first rather than attempting to push people to not use cars in the vain hope that eventually muni and bart may be improved.<p>ps -- muni is wildly expensive compared to any other competent city, plus very slow<p>ps2 -- I dare say that most people who will disagree with my contention about transport in sf either haven&#x27;t lived here or are young, able bodied, live in one of the few neighborhoods that are well-served, don&#x27;t have kids, and often eat out or at work",1431717056

Yes, it&#x27;s true most of us will probably never need to write mathematically-provable software [2] but it&#x27;s still good to know WHY we don&#x27;t do this for our day-to-day programming, by getting a feel for just how challenging it is to do this.<p>However, I&#x27;m no expert on writing provably-true software, so take my opinion with a grain of salt... you may want to wait for reviews from experts in this field who can compare this book to other alternatives.<p>[1] Note that the &quot;Little X&quot; series of books have a peculiar style and may not be to everyone&#x27;s taste. I&#x27;m speaking as someone who enjoyed all of the previous books in this series immensely.<p>[2] Although programmatic proofs may start becoming more mainstream in the future: For instance, with &quot;smart contracts&quot; they may play a major role, and are already planned as a feature for the ethereum solidity smart contract language... Not surprisingly, if you are handling currency in a contract, people like to know things like &quot;There is no scenario in which the other party can run away with all my money&quot;.",1431716476

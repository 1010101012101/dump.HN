It demands an email address before you tell me anything about your company or how it will ""change commercial real estate forever"". I don't want to you to spam me in the future so I enter a fake email address. Some ajax happens and it tells me to ""invite at least 3 friends using the link"" to get ""priority access"". I don't even know what your product does. I'm not going to spam my friends in order to get ""priority access"". Also there are links to follow you on twitter and ""like"" you on facebook. Again, I don't even know what your product does.<p>So I figure that the information must be in the email that you send to the address I give you. I give you my real address and lo and behold I get an email which says you're not going to tell me what your product does and that I should spam my friends with my referral link.<p>The only reason I would want to give you my email address or like your facebook page or follow you on twitter is because I'm interested in the product that you're creating.<p>Maybe I'm just weird, but this has been a negative experience with your company so far.<p>--<p>Nice blog post though.",1320267587
3188907,comment,3188635,3188635,1,0,mightybyte,,,"Totally disagree.  First, if you don't want to categorize, then don't--use one big circle.  I actually want to have fine-grained control over who I publish to, and Facebook's auto-discovered groups touted in the article don't do it for me.  The whole ""Don't embrace the shit work"" is not relevant either because you can't judge the value of a product by people who don't use it productively.  BTW, Most time spent on Facebook period isn't REAL work.  This is precisely why I don't have a Facebook account and don't spend tons of time on Google+.  But circles are crucial to my use of Google+, and Facebook's lack of a good implementation of the idea is the reason I never used it.",1320267574

The author isn't speaking to the people <i>using</i> these features, he's speaking to the people <i>making</i> these features. From a user's perspective, you are absolutely correct. People can simply ignore features. In fact, many people do. From a developer's perspective, that's the problem: many people are not using the feature that you made. If people aren't using the feature, then it was a waste of time to implement it. The post is providing guidance towards making features that actually get used, and were therefore not a waste of time.",1320267571

Even with the latest versions it does this.<p>The fact that they keep claiming ""it's a feature!!"" is what made me the most angry. Firefox is now useless to me as a web browser, I use it only in limited cases for web development. Chrome has completely replaced it.<p>""Oh but it's your add-ons."" No, it's not. Even disabling my add-ons and starting with a new profile Firefox eventually consumes more and more memory. ""Well that's what happens because it's saving history."" Ok, force restart it. It will open all the same tabs, each with the same amount of history for that tab...5% of the memory usage of before restarting it.<p>The thing is a bloated beast. I really do hope they fix it. I loved firefox when I used to use it, but it's not very useful to me as it is (firebug or not).",1320267516

3188891,comment,3188635,3188748,13,0,aprescott,,,"Reading your three situations, I have another one which I've been thinking about: a post which is informative and in some way beneficial to the public, but which a significant portion of the people you know simply do not care about.<p>For example, you may have an excellent piece of commentary about the history of Unix and the state of X, Y, Z in modern operating system design. Most of your non-technical friends, along with your family, in all likelihood do not care about this and will not find it interesting, so it's just noise to them. If you post it publicly, it's worthwhile to the Internet at large, but annoying to a select group. If you post it so that only the relevant individuals see it, and no one else, then the public potentially lose out.<p>Is there a simple solution here which I'm just not seeing? Is there a social network that deals with this appropriately? With Facebook, you can ""unsubscribe"", which means hiding a user's posts from your feed, but that seems like overkill. How do prominent developers deal with this? Do they just make their posts more generic and mainstream, and move the technical discussion elsewhere? Or do they just let their non-technical friends and family Deal With It?<p>Perhaps one solution is to mark a post with ""Family don't need to see this"", then skip the post for anyone in Family who views their stream/feed/timeline/whatever, probably with an unobtrusive notice which says ""post skipped"". But then there's added complexity, and  getting back to Zach's main point  it's more shit work.",1320267397
3188890,comment,3188609,3188609,4,0,lukev,,,"Not saying this isn't a great, useful library.<p>But - what do people have against SQL? As far as I can see, it's a pretty good language for relational data manipulation. But lots of people act like actually writing SQL is dirty work. It's not. It's an elegant, expressive language, for what it does.<p>Of course, use something like this if you have a documentable need for the flexibility/composability. If you're generating lots of custom queries, it may be justified.<p>But in nine out of ten projects I've seen which use a RDBMS, the system could be made substantially simpler, more performant <i>and</i> more flexible by just writing raw SQL queries instead of screwing around with ORMs.",1320267384
3188889,comment,3188146,3188146,13,0,geraldalewis,,,"jashkenas is one of the most prolific and talented JS devs around (CoffeeScript, backbone.js, underscore, docco are among his credits). I can see why he and other library producers would want as much flexibility in the language as possible.<p>Library <i>consumers</i>, on the other hand, will reap the most benefit from the proposed constraints.<p>`private` is important metadata for a library consumer. Documentation generators can ignore private members, and private tags serve as roadsigns that the member can be ignored if one is only interested in the API. `private` is a very powerful filter.<p>The same can be said for `const`: indicating a value shouldn't change eliminates one more thing one needs to hold in their head as they explore a lib's boundaries.<p>I don't care at all about the performance benefits; I care about communication. `private` and `const` are nearly-free, expressive documentation.<p>I actually like Ruby's ""red tape"" approach; it offers library consumers helpful metadata while still allowing flexibility. Maybe the best solution is for library developers to rigorously use the _private and CONST naming conventions, and reserve `private`, `const`, and `freeze` for security-sensitive code. Wouldn't that offer the most flexibility?",1320267380

3188879,comment,3188635,3188635,1,0,tomlin,,,"Absolutely right. I am finding that, especially with mobile, you have to really think about the design so that <i>shit work</i> is cut to a minimum. For example, I am in the process of making an iOS app, but it interfaces with an external appliance. I don't <i>want</i> to ask the user to input host, port, etc., so instead I'd much rather do the extra leg work and implement uPnP detection and <i>then</i> ask the user as a last resort. Apple has figured this out. 70% is in your face while the rest is within hands reach.<p>As an analogy, Circles is driving users to a brick wall hoping they will climb over to see what is the big deal is. Assuming they care. Assuming they aren't in the middle of something when they get the invite.<p>Which makes me think about the ""Find My Friends"" App on iOS. If Apple flipped the ""social"" switch, they would have creatively acquired a power which no other social network would be able to grasp without huge privacy backlash - knowledge of where you and all of your friends are at any given time. Here's the sell: You already have the app. How does this relate to <i>shit work</i>? Well, you'd be apart of a social network where you, your friends are already members, your latest photos are already there (iCloud), you know where your friends are and what they are doing - and you did very little work.",1320267274

Leafblowers are diabolical machines. Even if the claims their promoters make for them were true, the damage leafblowers do outweighs such meager benefits by many, many orders of magnitude.<p>Thanks to decades of relentless lobbying by their manufacturers, the two-cylinder engines that drive leafblowers have never been regulated by any Federal or State agency. The engines, as a result, are crude, cheap, and inefficient, as well as harmful to the environment and everything living in it. Because they are designed to be air-cooled, the engines release 100% of their tailgate emissions directly into the environment, and since they also burn fuel very inefficiently, a leafblower running for one hour emits as many hydrocarbons and other pollutants into the atmosphere as a car driven at 55 mph for 110 miles.<p>The noise leafblowers make is hideous. Although they operate on only two cylinders, these machines run at at speeds roughly three times faster than a cars. In the process lots of energy is released in the form of high frequency sound waves with decibel levels that far exceed acceptable limits. The incessant, high-pitched whine of a single leafblower in the distance is enough to set peoples teeth on edge; a couple of blowers going nearby can push almost anyone to the brink of homicide. The idea that leafblowers save time - which is the one and only argument for using them - is outrageous, since it implies that the time stolen from the rest of us is worthless.<p>Using these hideously noisy, highly polluting machines on sidewalks and driveways is bad enough. Turning them on lawns and gardens, beneath shrubs, between hedges, and around the trunks of trees - as everyone is obviously doing these days - is irrational. Unless, that is, the people who are doing it are landscape professionals, in which case it is negligent, almost to the point of criminal.<p>If that seems extreme, consider that wind blows from the nozzles of these machines at speeds in the range of 180 mph. Winds of that force do not occur naturally on Earth, except inside hurricanes and tornadoes. Worse, still, because the wind is carrying away large quantities of heat from the hyperactive engine, it is also very hot and exceedingly dry.<p>Subjecting everything at ground level to blasts of hot, dry, hurricane-force winds would be ill-advised at any time, since it cannot fail to injure plants and open pathways for pests and disease, while at the same time aiding and abetting the pathogens by distributing them over the widest possible area. In the summer, though, when the air is hot and the ground is dry and the plants are dehydrated and badly stressed to begin with, subjecting them to tornadic blasts of hot, dry air is, nonsensical, to put it kindly.<p>Leafblowers literally scour the earth: stripping off topsoil, desiccating roots, and killing vital soil-dwelling organisms, while, at the same time, propelling into the air clouds of dirt, dust and dangerous contaminants: volatile compounds, mold and fungal spores, weed seeds, insect eggs, pollen, molecules of the myriads of toxic chemicals people spray and sprinkle on their gardens, trees, and lawns, not to mention bird and rodent feces, and more.<p>It goes without saying (but must be said anyway), that leafblowers pose the greatest threat to the health and hearing of the untold numbers of landscape workers who use them on a daily basis, in most cases without adequate protective equipment, for intervals that far exceed OSHA guidelines. Unfortunately, the workers themselves tend to exaggerate the benefits and deny the risks of blowing leaves with machines, which they strongly favor over rakes, for reasons that probably have more to do with symbolism than practicality.<p>Ironically, leafblowers were not invented to blow leaves; they were originally designed as crop dusters. In other words, they didnt come about in response to a genuine need for a mechanized solution to the leaf-removal problem. Because there wasnt any problem. Now we do have a problem, but it isnt leaves, its these infernal machines.<p>Gasoline-driven leafblowers have been banned in scores of California counties, including Los Angeles and hundreds of municipalitiesacross the U.S. and Canada, and none of the horrors that were predicted by landscapers - untidy lawns, escalating costs, declining property values - has ever come to pass.<p>The phenomenal proliferation of leafblowers has far more to do with marketing than efficiency; indeed, when all the real costs are factored in their alleged benefits dont even begin to justify their penalties and risks. Cheap to produce, priced to sell, and aggressively marketed, the real function of leafblowers is to rake in money for the huge corporations that manufacture them.<p>By Winifred Rosen, Guest Commentator\nDrWeil.com News<p>Winifred Rosen is co-author with Dr. Weil of Chocolate to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know about Mind-Altering Drugs.",1320266095
3188812,comment,3186426,3187426,2,0,rwl,,,"> It was my impression that high schools and parents were the mechanism for indoctrinating youths into community values. Moreover, without playing too hard to personal experience, if my classmates at uni are tomorrow's leaders I'm a great deal concerned.<p>Obviously, parents and pre-college education are important (though if they're doing their jobs well, I wouldn't refer to what they're doing as ""indoctrination"").  But why should education in cognitive, moral, aesthetic, political, etc. skills end with high school graduation?  Your second sentence here underscores this point:  today's 18-year olds are <i>not</i> fully-formed citizens, ready to become ""tomorrow's leaders"" without further development.<p>> What are these ""hard problems""? Hunger? Disease? Working boring jobs to shuffle little bits of paper around? I'd wager that the root of your ""hard problems"" is ultimately scarcity in one form or another, and the only way to address that is through technology, and the only way to get that is through STEM training.<p>Hunger and disease are hard problems, yes.  And of course, having people with technical training is required for solving them, and for solving any problem that stems from some kind of physical scarcity.<p>But hunger and disease are two hard problems that are particularly easy to conceive, and whose solutions are likewise readily understood: basically, more food and better medicine.  Once a problem and its solution are understood, implementing the solution is very often a matter of working out the technical details.<p>I think that many of the hard problems facing us are not so easily conceived, and their solutions once conceived are far from obvious.  For example: what, if anything, should we do about rising income inequality?  What consequences does polarization in political discourse have for our ability to address the divergent needs and interests of different groups of people?  Which of our social norms are beneficial, and which are harmful?  What reasons do we have to support the production of fine art or architecture, and how (if at all) should we do it?  What rights and treatment should our institutions afford to those (prisoners, revolutionaries, the merely uninterested) who directly or indirectly undermine them?<p>I think these questions---and others like them, which we might not even have the language to express yet---are some of the hardest yet most important questions to answer.  But they don't boil down to questions of ""scarcity"" in any obvious way, and I have a hard time seeing how technical training could ever help produce citizens who are capable of answering them in a reflective and reasonable way.<p>That doesn't mean that STEM training isn't valuable.  And as I said here (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3187739"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3187739</a>) many STEM programs <i>are</i> liberal arts programs that do provide the skills required to answer questions like these.",1320266078

If I recall correctly, the renderer still looked more like a blend of C with some C++ slowly drifting in (which makes sense, given how good of a C programmer Carmack is), but the rest of the game code is very heavily C++, for some definition of C++, along with a scripting layer.<p>Having worked extensively with the Quake 2 engine previously, I really didn't like the Doom 3 engine, myself.  It was radically less... pragmatic.  Earlier id engines, to me, were masterpieces of concision.  They weren't amazing feats of black box abstraction by any measure, and they implicitly assumed you needed a lot of domain knowledge to understand what they were doing, but they did exactly what they needed to do with a minimum of fuss. Features were included because they were used, generally with the smallest and simplest code and tool footprint possible.<p>Not so with Doom 3.  Huge amount of code appears to have been written because someone prolific thought it would be lots of fun to write it, many features end up going unused or are in the way, and ultimately (because it's more typically software engineered in style), every feature requires about 30 times as much code to be written properly and has several extra unused layers of abstractions crufting things up.  The game code (in C++) in particular bears an unfortunate resemblance to Windows MFC-style C++, with a giant 12 layer deep inheritance graph with everything inheriting from a few enormous base objects.<p>All of that to my eyes, anyway.  But then, I really cut my teeth on Quake 1 and 2, and found that their concision and brevity really helped them stay out of the way when adding new, innovative features.<p>The funny thing about the code for Doom 3 is that, looking through it all, you'd get the impression that Doom 3 was a radically more complicated game that what you ultimately experience when you play the game.<p>The best way I could put it is this: Quake 1 and 2 and 3 were well made games that ended up being enormously fruitful for white box reuse.  You couldn't do much with them without understanding fair bits of their internals, but they didn't actively resist being understood.  Doom3 was built to be used in a more black box fashion (like the Unreal Engine), with all that entails from an architecture perspective.  I'm sure others might disagree with me from a code ideology perspective, but it is hard to ignore how fruitful the Quake engines were for licensing, and how much Doom 3 sank like a stone.<p>The code bases make really fascinating studies in contrast about the consequences of different software engineering values, at the very least.<p>TL; DR: Quake 1 - 3 remind me of linux code, Doom 3 reminds me of MFC.",1320265982

There is certainly the recognition that people are looking for dates so that changes things a bit.<p>2)Users will be able to search for dates for themselves or set their friends up on dates as a matchmaker. We're coming up with ways to incentivize the matchmakers but for the meantime are hoping users will find the experience of matchmaking fun.  There is concern that the matchmaker will be put in an awkward situation if the date does not go well for their friend, but that really isn't any different than setting someone up offline.<p>3)There is no cost to businesses to use TLF.  We help businesses solve the ""butts in seats"" problem so they are happy to work with us to arrange a deal that allows us to have users prepay for their dates.<p>4)We are starting with singles events.<p>5)We completely agree.

The Earth and Moon have essentially the same velocity relative to the sun, since they orbit it together.  The Moon moves a bit slower at new phase and faster at full phase because its Earth-relative velocity subtracts from or adds to its Sun-relative velocity, but the former is 1 km/sec and the latter is 30 km/sec, small potatoes.<p>As for who gets hit; Earth's mass is 81 times that of the Moon so it attracts objects 81 times as strongly.  Really, the Moon would only get hit if Earth already pulled an object into a collision course or near-miss and the Moon just happened to get in the way at the right time.

It contributes to point 2, wherein:<p>2) If you're underwhelmed that Siri isn't perfect, it's because you were sold perfect - Apple has some of the best marketers on the planet, and they sold you a science fiction dream and then you were disappointed when you didn't get it. The long and short of it is that Siri isn't a learning, adaptive AI - it's a voice control system with a short-term history and some clever responses baked in. It's a very good voice control system, and the developers have done a great job of giving the appearance of a personality, but it's basically an evolved Speak-N-Say.<p>If you stop expecting Siri to be a Star Trek shipboard AI that can understand the intent in your every query and return information to you instantly in perfectly-inflected English, you'll be a lot happier (though probably a bit less impressed) with it.",1320264633

My point is that a language like Haskell (or Java, take your pick), can still have easy to use libraries written for it.<p>Sure, you can't change the methods of a class has at run time. Who cares? Like I said you can just create an object wrapper, sometimes called a decorator if you are into design patterns, that has all of the methods of the original object plus a few more (or even a few less, doesn't matter). This gives you all of the functions of the original object plus more, just like modifying a class at runtime does. Possible in Java, possible in Haskell, possible even in JavaScript.<p>The only difference is that you have to explicitly call into the wrapper classes. You can't expect objects that you instantiate from outside your library to have these methods.<p>But again, who cares. If you want to use the cool new library functions, use them. Otherwise don't.<p>Specific example: if we are talking about jquery, you can't expect document.GetElementById('foo') to have special jquery functions. But you can expect $('#foo') to have them, which is the same thing so you really have nothing to complain about.",1320264599

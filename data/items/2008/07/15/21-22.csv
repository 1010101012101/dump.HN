And if that illiterate foreman was suddenly required to pass a college English 101 class in order to keep his job... the world would lose a perfectly good foreman.<p>For some reason your story reminded me of Captain Bill Eddy, television pioneer of the 1930s and 40s. Here he is in his own words (from one of my favorite books: <i>The Box: An Oral History of Television 1920 - 1961</i>):<p>""I started losing my hearing as a kid and was deaf when I entered the Navy, but I had learned to read lips, so every time they put me through the audio tests, they said I had perfect hearing. With the great knowledge of the Navy I was assigned to be sound officer on the submarine. I couldn't hear the signals coming from the enemy submarines, so I went to Kresge's department store and bought some parts and devised an amplifier where the sound signals came out as a movement on a dial. By looking at the dial, I knew if we were on target for an enemy ship and could fire a torpedo. It worked very well, and our submarine was the only one that was scoring hits. Soon, so many people had these amplifiers and were scoring hits that the Navy Department heard about it, and they asked me to develop a model of this amplifier using the finest parts. I put it together and it didn't work. In desperation, I went out to Kresge's and bought these cheap tubes and transformers and put together the Eddy Amplifier and it worked. It became a very interesting patent because it only worked with Kresge parts. That's how I got into electronics.""<p>""In 1934 the Navy finally tripped me up by changing to an electronic system of measuring hearing. I was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for retirement.""<p>Fortunately, the Navy's loss was Philo Farnsworth's gain...",1216158716

In my senior year high school English class I had a teacher who liked me, so she had me grade papers in lieu of some other work.  In particular, I remember proofreading drafts of my classmates' college admissions essays.  They were deplorable.  The best one was grammatically tolerable, adhering closely to the rigid five-paragraph ""keyhole"" format that we'd all had drilled into our heads, but was all about how much the author loved playing Counterstrike and the lessons it taught him about teamwork.  The worst few were outright incomprehensible.  I handed those back to the teacher unedited and asked her whether their authors spoke English as their native language.  They did.  And this was an honors class at what is generally considered the strongest public high school in Florida.",1216157193

It smacks of the 'Oprah-watching, feel-good-book-reading, ""let's hold hands and sing kumbaya""' bullshit that pervades society.<p>The fact is that people have differing levels of ability. but with everybody screaming for 'equality,' everyone has to have some 'special gift.' I'm not saying that some lives are worth more than others (although there's an interesting philosophical argument against this), but the idea that 'you can do anything you set your mind to' is false.",1216157123

It compares each of the pixels of Block A with the corresponding pixel in Block B.<p>Its the simplest possible block comparison metric that still takes into account all individual pixels.  Its popular not only because of its inherent simplicity, but also because of the psadbw MMX/SSE instruction that makes it extremely fast on x86 CPUs.<p>A motion search generally involves a whole lot of SADs, and since the motion search is the core of any video encoder, making the SADs faster has a huge impact on performance.",1216156994

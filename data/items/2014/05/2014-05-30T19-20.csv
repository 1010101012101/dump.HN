Current ISPs take advantage of monopolies granted to them in particular geographic areas by state and local governments to force users to buy a package that combines both of these things, even if that&#x27;s not really what users want.<p>Common carrier regulation of the &quot;pipe to the Internet&quot; business would force the two things to be separated. If Comcast wants to be a content company because that&#x27;s where all the profits are, fine: but then they shouldn&#x27;t be able to force users to buy their pipe to the Internet to get their content (still less should they be able to charge <i>other</i> content providers extra to get faster access to their users&#x27; pipe to the Internet).",1401479369

For sub-second adhoc queries we go against bitmap indexes. Other queries we uses RDD.cache() after a group/cogroup and answer queries directly from that. For other queries we go hit ORC files.  Spark is very memory sensitive compared to hadoop, so using a columnar store and only pulling out the data that you absolutely need goes a very long way.

It&#x27;s impossible to achieve that if you&#x27;re waiting for TB of data to shuffle around =)<p>> How many machines / cores are running across?<p>Depends on the use case.

Putting <i>any</i> pay gate in front of this will greatly decrease the amount of abuse you get.  You&#x27;ll still have abuse problems, but abuse is largely a matter of &quot;outrunning your friend, not outrunning the grizzly.&quot;  When you&#x27;re free and automatable, you are the weakest link on the Internet for possible exploitation.  Even though people can use e.g. stolen credit cards and fake data to sign up for services, you will no longer be the weakest link even with that trivial barrier, greatly decreasing the amount of abuse you&#x27;ll suffer.<p>This is why Appointment Reminder requires a CC upfront, by the way.  I have very little desire to again be on a conference call with a lawyer and a police detective about violation of a restraining order made possible by an ex-husband being able to essentially proxy his harassing phone calls through my software.<p>There exist a variety of potential scalable anti-abuse measures you could implement here.  For example, I think that foo.ngrok.com should probably have a low, hard limit on how many IPs/regions/etc should be able to connect with to it.  Nobody should be putting production systems on it, so if 100 IPs are connecting to one of the ngrok sites, that&#x27;s likely either a) abuse or b) a use case which you should not be supporting on a free tier.<p>Relatedly: the problem with abuse, here and elsewhere, isn&#x27;t limited to &quot;My hosting provider is opening tickets.  If I don&#x27;t catch one, the site shuts down.&quot;  Abuse which your hosting provider doesn&#x27;t catch is still abuse.

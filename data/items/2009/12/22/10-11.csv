Best purchase by them ever, since it's an alternative water cooler and has saved many hours of walking down to the coffee shop. Granted we drink more coffee but when we go to get one we do so as a group and have an impromptu discussion (usually 50% work related) which gives us a break and allows communication between the hardware and software teams to flow freely.<p>I can imagine that if they ever took that away there would immediately be a mass exodus of employees.<p>Oh, and I do drink the coffee without sugar or any sweetener and with skim milk (mostly) so it's not that bad for my health.",1261479546

The only way to control it is by choosing your environment (friends) wisely.<p>As for the FUD, I look at it like this:<p>Programming is an innately painful experience: you get punished for everything you do wrong, and the reward for getting it right is that the program works exactly how you pictured it in your mind N minutes/hours/days ago. So to sell a new programming language you have to convince people the language is less painful than what they're using now. This is most easily accomplished by pointing out existing pain points in other languages, and hammering on those over and over. And lo, mysql-real-escape-string and IStringBuilderFactory<T> become easy targets.<p>A secondary reason may be that the most vocal members of the community may not be the best spokespeople. People who are getting [stuff] done tend not to get involved in most language wars and FUD. This I assume applies to all fields, not just CompSci & CompLang.",1261478833

Suppose that once this new individual arrives, the rules that I agree with him are ""you pay me x percent of your income, and you may use my agriculture and infrastructure"".<p>In this context you can call it rent. However extend that to an entire country with a ruling class, and you may rename it taxation. When democracy emerges and the ruling class becomes the people, then we are back where we started.<p>While I disagree any implication that the sole basis of taxation should be an assessment of ""how much have you used""; I agree that this should be a part of it.

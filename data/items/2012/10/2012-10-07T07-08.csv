4622863,comment,4622192,4622516,3,0,adrianhoward,,,"<i>How do you square this sort of mindset with the well-known demands of entrepreneurship?</i><p>Because the 'well-known demands' are mostly socially constructed myths rather than reality. Because people are really bad at tracking stuff-done and find tracking hours-worked and looking at stuff-to-do much easier to think about. Because people a <i>really fucking awful</i> at figuring out how productive they are.<p>I have been a team coach <i>multiple</i> times where I have demonstrated by, weirdly, actually tracking the amount of work done that teams working fewer hours were producing more work. The amount of push back from these sorts of results from management <i>and</i> the team is incredible.<p>People <i>know</i> that if they only stayed a bit later they would get more done despite lots of evidence, by our tracking stories completed, bug reports, user satisfaction, etc. all went down the more hours people worked.<p>Tired people make mistakes. Tired people work slowly. You can be tired without 'feeling' tired. In anything but the very short term (and I'm talking days, maybe a week or two tops) trying to do hard intellectual, creative work for more than 30-40 hours a week will make you slower overall - not faster.<p>Hell - Ford promoted the 40 hour week as the maximum productivity point for physical labour on a production line... and we somehow imagine that working 60 hour weeks is going to make us do more.<p>People still seem to conceptualise 60 hour weeks as 40 normal hours + 20 extra. In fact it's 60 hours of being knackered where you're probably being half as productive as you would be if you were fully rested - but you're too damn tired to realise it.",1349596624

4622854,comment,4620452,4621998,2,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Furthermore if you are going to overwrite something in flash it usually behooves you to overwrite an entire block at a time.<p>Well, all block devices are written a block at a time. The way flash differs is that there are two internal block sizes -- called pages (4-8kB), and eraseblocks (256kB-4MB).<p>There are two states a page can be in: clear, or used. You can write at a page granularity, but only to clear pages. To clear used pages, you need to clear the entire eraseblock at a time. Eraseblock sizes are now limited by fundamental physical limits -- on every NAND node shrink from now, the eraseblocks are going to double in size. And they are already really huge in modern devices.",1349596056

However, many people will probably recommend a different distro.<p>No matter what OS you install, as long as it's not Windows it won't be vulnerable to Windows attacks. Linux, for example, will be theoretically vulnerable to Linux attacks, however there are few in number and they generally get patched before someone can take advantage of them. If you want the maximum in security that would probably be one of the BSDs; however, bear in mind that there is less software available for BSD than for Linux.<p>TrueCrypt can be used to lock a partition, a backup file, or an encrypted container for everyday use.

Part of the problem in academic labs is that there is this race to publish papers to get more funding to publish more papers to get more funding and so on. If journals stopped treating data that goes against an initial hypothesis as 'bad data' there would be a incentive to still publish it, and ideally, prevent someone else from repeating the same experiment/hypothesis.",1349593615

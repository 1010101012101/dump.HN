484826,comment,484518,484776,0,0,weavejester,,,"I'm not sure there is such thing as an inherently boring software project. You can approach it in a boring way, but given free reign, I daresay a programmer could find something interesting in any project.<p>For instance, document management is not very sexy software, but Zed Shaw's recent talk on rethinking ACLs was extremely interesting. I'd love to be able to apply my current language of choice (Clojure) to document management, or indeed any type of software that is usually considered dull.<p>The boring part of software development comes when, IMO, you don't automate something, or are forbidden to, due to time constraints.<p>But perhaps that's because I have yet to encounter a truly boring type of software project :)",1234897036

I already wrote in another part of this discussion ""Most of the things one wants or needs to do on the net are most easily accomplished with dedicated tools, so places where only netcat will serve are rare."" On the other hand, my little trick does just take a few seconds, and is probably easier than getting ethereal (oops, wireshark) set up for someone new to it.<p>I do think it's still useful to be aware of and play with tools like netcat, even when there are dedicated tools to accomplish most tasks. It's a bit like hacking in assembly... probably not practical in many cases, but you'll learn how stuff works underneath, and that understanding can still be really useful even when working at a higher level of abstraction.",1234896814

484818,comment,484518,484518,0,0,weavejester,,,"To me, boring programming implies having to perform a repetitive task that requires little mental effort. I don't think I've ever come across a programming problem that was both dull and not potentially automatable.<p>The difficulty with automation is that it can take longer than solving the problem by hand. But I'd contend this is a short-term viewpoint. First, very few problems are entirely unique; there's always some general component that they have in common with other problems you may have, even if that general component is not immediately obvious. Automating a system now almost always means less work in future.<p>Second, at least in my experience, a programmer would much rather write a program to do something boring than do it him or herself. Automating a repetitive task is immensely satisfying, especially if it continues to save time again in future. If you work for a company that encourages programmers to automate everything, you're probably a lot more motivated than a programmer that has to do something excruciatingly repetitive, and a lot less likely to be checking recruitment agencies.<p>When I starting working for my current employer, a lot of things were hastily done and there was a lot of repetition. Over time, we've snuck in hours here and there to improve our processes. Not as much as I'd like, but enough that we've slowly made progress, and each time we've automated something it's been an interesting and rewarding task. After suffering through manually doing X for the last N weeks, it's <i>very</i> satisfying to ensure you never ever have to do that again.",1234896444

Wall Street lured a lot of really smart people by promising them a lot of money. Then, in turn, they asked of those same smart people to create as much money as they could, as fast as they could. Smart people are good at solving problems, so they created all sorts of new and interesting ways to make money quickly. Nobody in management worried about the long-term ramifications and didn't ask the smart, creative folks working for them to worry about the long-term either.

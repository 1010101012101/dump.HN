2863513,comment,2861840,2862863,4,0,Mz,,,"I do recall Katrina being framed that way by the media.  But I also remember watching the LA riots and my impression was always that the military got sent in because it was so out of hand and not stopping.  The military has also been sent in historically to protect blacks when schools were desegregated and for other Civil Rights incidents on behalf of blacks.  Just because the media shows it's bias doesn't mean racial bias is why the military does the things it does.<p>Not entirely on topic, since the soldiers don't decide where they go, but while we are on the topic(s) of racism and the military:  The US military tends to be more multi-racial/multi-cultural than most civilian social climes and there tends to be less racism in it.  The joke in the military is that they are the ""green"" race -- ie the color of their uniform makes them all one ""race"", separate from the civilians who are typically not very welcoming of the military members stationed in their community yet still want to milk them for money.  The loyalty to a cause larger than themselves and willingness to bleed and die for it seems to overcome differences that are often insurmountable in the minds of other people.  That whole ""I am willing to die defending you and you are willing to die defending me"" paradigm is a commitment and a bond deeper than many families or lovers have.  It makes things like skin color seem rather superficial and insignificant in comparison.<p>My ex was wonderfully non-racist and I became uncomfortably aware of just how much my mind had been poisoned from growing up in the Deep South when I finally met his best friend at a new duty station after months of hearing glowing things about the guy.  The guy was black. My ex had never once mentioned that and the surprise showed on my face, which made for a very awkward meeting. It has been food for thought ever since about the topic of racism and I think I have grown as a person because of it.",1312885532

As someone who loves good UX, and as an iPhone user, I sincerely this doesn't catch on.<p>The look and feel of iOS is an <i>incredibly</i> core part of the user experience of the platform (as it is with any platform), the wholesale replacement of these stock widgets with completely custom ones breaks user expectation, generates inconsistencies, and if the goal of cross-platform write-once-compile-anywhere is being sought, will simply create lowest common denominator UI - i.e., leverages none of the strengths of any platform, leaving only the most bland, mundane, and uninspiring intersection of all its target OSes.<p>To be clear, I'm not at all opposed to innovating with custom widgets and UI elements (the drag-down-to-refresh is one of the more ingenuous new UI patterns that's come from the community instead of one of the big companies), but this is trying to completely build a completely parallel UI layer beside the native OS one.<p>It's the same reason why I oppose Java-based UIs. No matter which platform you use it on, it never really behaves like the native widgets, and there are inconsistencies big and small that drive users up the wall. The core <i>theme</i> of consumer software in the past few years has been that superior UX trumps everything, up to and including having inferior features to your competition.

This has affected at least one of your snapshots in the EU-West Region.<p>During a recent run of this EBS software in the EU-West Region, one or more blocks in a number of EBS snapshots were incorrectly deleted. The root cause was a software error that caused the snapshot references to a subset of blocks to be missed during the reference counting process. This process compares the blocks scheduled for deletion to the blocks referenced in customer snapshots. As a result of the software error, the EBS snapshot management system in the EU-West Region incorrectly thought some of the blocks were no longer being used and deleted them. We've addressed the error in the EBS snapshot system to prevent it from recurring.<p>We have now disabled all of your snapshots that contain these missing blocks. You can determine which of your snapshots were affected via the AWS Management Console or the DescribeSnapshots API call. The status for any affected snapshots will be shown as ""error.""<p>We have created copies of your affected snapshots where we've replaced the missing blocks with empty blocks. You can create a new volume from these snapshot copies and run a recovery tool on it (e.g. a file system recovery tool like fsck); in some cases this may restore normal volume operation. These snapshots can be identified via the snapshot Description field which you can see on the AWS Management Console or via the DescribeSnapshots API call. The Description field contains ""Recovery Snapshot snap-xxxx"" where snap-xxx is the id of the affected snapshot. Alternately, if you have any older or more recent snapshots that were unaffected, you will be able to create a volume from those snapshots without error.

Instead, everything just collectively gets paged out to disk, then sluggish and sloshed, and eventually inoperable. And at that point you really can't pinpoint it down to some stupid web page because everything is equally paged out by the time.</i><p>There's always swapoff(8) if you want that behavior back...might want to tweak your /proc/$PID/oom_adj (assuming Linux) to make sure the OOM-killer axes the ""right"" process, though.",1312884268

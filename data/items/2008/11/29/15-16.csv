That must be an integral part of any web application design methodology.  For traditional kinds of desktop applications, that wasn't so much of a concern.<p>In my day job, we have a Java back end with a lot of user interaction implemented with Javascript in the browser.  Data access server side stuff actually plays to a lot of Java's strengths, I think, and the more dynamic nature of Javascript is a good fit for DOM manipulation in the browser.  I'm not sure I would want to pick one of them to run both places.",1227973773

380166,comment,379379,379911,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"And at this point in the troll thread it's probably too late to point out that Al Gore has apparently gone out of his way to power his house with renewable energy. [1] Because, you know, of what use are facts in a character assassination?<p>But the point is that Al Gore is not advocating that you live like a hermit. He's advocating that hermits live like hermits on renewable power, that lawyers live like lawyers on renewable power, and that millionaires live like millionaires on renewable power. Which he does, to the extent that the infrastructure makes it easy. And then, because he's neither a back-to-nature homesteader nor a backyard engineer, he wisely invests his time and energy in what he is good at: <i>lobbying for better infrastructure</i> so that we can all create less CO2.<p>The irony is that if Al Gore <i>did</i> live like Saint Francis he would be less effective. He would be accused of being some kind of scary hippie socialist. That script is just sitting on the shelf waiting to be used. ""What does Al Gore have against the average middle-class millionaire?"" would be the cry. ""He wants to force you to live like a hermit even after you make ten million dollars!"" Or maybe they'd just make fun of his hair. That never gets old.<p>[1] Wikipedia entry on ""Al Gore"". I'm not about to descend farther into the research chain, dodging propaganda all the way.

If you have a smart HR department they're often helpful as well.<p>Especially in San Francisco it's going to be brutal and pretty much a full-time job.

380139,comment,378003,378432,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Sorry for late response - holiday weekend.<p>I'm trying to setup the company very loosely to attract entrepreneurial developers. We have plain-english contracts in Google Docs that we jointly edit until we're both satisfied.<p>Since I've been responsible for all of our current product ideas, I'm entitled to a majority of the profit (usually 60%) but it's negotiated on a per-project basis. For example, one of our app's has a ""web service"" integrated into it hoping we can monetize on ads on backside traffic. Per $1 we decrease that products price, he gets an additional 10% of the ad revenue on said website. That said, I think you need to handle each product and developer on a case-by-case basis.<p>As long as the developer adequately stands behind the product with support and feature-add, then they get to keep their share. If they are not interested in supporting, adding features, or localizing the app for other countries -- then their profit decreases ~20% per additional developer required.<p>I also extend each developer the ability to publish through our company account on their own terms if they have an idea. Whether or not our company directly promotes their product(s) is up to me (and them).<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions.",1227971526

380133,comment,379942,379942,0,0,mahipal,,,"Another great opportunity that's unique to the college experience is the chance to do research and work closely with a professor. You mentioned you have a lot of experience in computer vision. If that's something that interests you further, I'm sure you could pretty easily land a job in a research lab working on cutting-edge computer vision problems. Just talk to a professor who is doing work that interests you, and bring your resume and code samples. With your background, you're easily one of the most qualified undergrads on campus -- and you'd be hard pressed to find a day job that lets you work on something that interesting.<p>And some universities will provide startup support if a research lab produces a marketable idea. Who knows -- in 4 years, you could have a stack of scientific publications under your belt, or you could be in business with a professor.<p>The social environment of a university is unique too. Nowhere else will you find such a large group of people who don't yet have the stress of working a day job and are willing to discuss whatever academic issues interest you. The opportunity to make connections and meet like-minded people is biggest here. I've met the most brilliant people I know at my college, and I'll be going back over the coming months to hire some of them for my startup. It would be significantly harder to find programmers and thinkers like that in the free market.<p>I think people like Gates and Dell are extreme outliers that greatly improve the drop-out image. Unless you have a lucrative idea that's already taken off and it's clear your time is much more profitably spent outside of college, it's silly to think you can easily follow in their footsteps. It would be different if you had a plan, and you may well reconsider if you launch a successful idea while you're still in school.<p>For everyone else though -- whether you're trying to get a corporate job or pitching to VCs -- having the endorsement of a top school greatly helps your image. Even with your years of experience and great background, it's a sad but true fact that many people would automatically give you less consideration than college graduates.<p>It's pretty clear you're not going to college for the education. Think of the classes you have to take as the 10-20 hr/week day job that you trudge through for the sake of the rest of the experience. If attendance isn't mandatory, you're probably better off skipping all the boring classes that cover the things you know. In the meantime... make connections. Talk to fellow students, your professors, everyone. Find like-minded people and brainstorm with them. Take the most advanced classes you possibly can -- surely there's something that will challenge you. There's a lot more to the college experience than just the classroom, though.<p>Don't think that the only benefit of the college route is taking classes, getting a degree, and going to a corporate job. I fully intend to never, ever work a corporate job after I graduate. Exploit the possibilities and opportunities to further yourself, and do the things that truly interest you.",1227970848

Past 20 years have been very nice to the tech sector and to equities in general. What are you going to say when your employer suddenly collapses and takes your pension/stock wealth with it (Enron, Bear Stearns etc)?<p>Even more extreme -- what if the whole economic cycle reverses, the currency devalues and inflation eats up your savings? Hard to imagine, but economic systems have this capacity for extreme events. I know the whole generation of honest engineers in Soviet Union who have not built a capital to retire on (obviously) and who were left desolate in their 50s-60s without pensions or jobs when their state companies/research labs collapsed.<p>Startup offers an option to strike it rich. If you hit the sweet spot of some business 'fitness function' - then you're set for life. If not, the most obvious strategy is to try as many startups as possible in your lifetime. This is like having a venture fund spread in time. One of your holdings should make it, the rest of them you expect to fail. It's nice if the winner comes when you're in your 20s :) But not necessary.<p>However, focusing on a single make-or-brake business idea and betting your farm (life) on it is a stupid idea. It is sad that many engineers are actually one-idea phenomena simply because of their specialization. Venture capitalists are in the best position, as they sit on the portfolio of options (startups).",1205941911

And then maybe you can hit up some people at Community Next or something to add to the prize pool.<p>But if you really do want merely nifty, you could just set up a restricted subreddit for judging... although I'm sure I didn't have to tell you that!",1205941798

If so, I'd definitely go big-company: it's an additional credential on your resume that can open doors for future internships or employment.<p>Otherwise, it depends a lot on the companies involved and your specific situation.  I agree with other posters that you should, at some point, <i>try</i> a big company and see if it's right for you before jumping into startups.  OTOH, you'll learn many more skills at a startup, and will probably have a more exciting time.  If you plan to do hobby or open-source programming, a startup is also more likely to improve your chops.<p>Something else to consider: at a startup, you'll often have access to the full existing source code repository, and the tree will be small enough that you can understand most of it.  At a big company, you'll probably be silo'd into a single project with its own repository, or worse, use no source control at all.  Some of my best programming lessons have come from reading other people's source code; I got lots of that when I worked for startups, and very little interning for large companies.",1205941093

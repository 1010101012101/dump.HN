Many client applications which required plugins or native code can now be implemented in JavaScript using advanced HTML5 features.<p>I presume your question is actually why server-side JavaScript?<p>One language, one toolset<p>The use of a single platform on the client and server means that developer skills will transfer more easily from client to server work.  This can lead to more consistent project quality and easier developer scheduling.<p>DOM and library portability<p>By using JavaScript everywhere, it is possible to have the same functions on both the client and server, and to run them ""close to the data"" to avoid unnecessary latency and bandwidth costs.  Using libraries like jsdom, it is even possible to write DOM manipulation code on the server, so that more capable clients can render the UI on the client while backwards-compatibility (with IE6, for example) is maintained through server-side rendering.<p>Node.js and asynchronicity<p>The use of server-side JavaScript is still quite new, however, and the critical development there is node.js.  By using node.js, developers can implement fast, JIT-compiled, garbage-collected server logic, with libraries that enforce asynchronicity.  Asynchronous servers are (usually) able to deliver more application throughput than threaded servers on the same hardware, but asynchronous (or ""event-based"", or ""non-blocking"") server programming has traditionally been very difficult and error prone.<p>JavaScript, by the fact of being a highly dynamic functional language, tends to make writing event-based programs a bit simpler, or at least easier for the average programmer to comprehend.<p>For more background on event-based server programming, read up on Twisted and libevent, and read the classic papers ""Threads: Threat or Menace?"", ""Why Threads Are a Bad Idea (For Most Purposes)"", and ""Threads Considered Harmful"".<p>Source : <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-want-to-build-an-entire-application-using-only-JavaScript-client-and-server-side/answer/Michael-Hanson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-want-to-build-an-enti...</a>",1368259168

I have lots of clients who would rather just pick up a phone and call, not because it is urgent, but because it is easier for them. If I'm busy that just goes to voicemail and I'll deal with it later, because <i>I can't control how other people use the phone</i>.<p>I actually have a reverse order of priority in communication, which is interesting. It'd probably be texts (seen immediately), emails (seen quickly, acted on if urgent), then phone calls as low priority (may or may not answer). This is because I dislike interruptions and many people have my number, and most of my contacts don't consider phone calls urgent only.<p>Since for you it's a high priority interrrupt, you wouldn't be entering the number into website forms, and would not be called.

Used to ML, Common Lisp, Ada, and, most importantly, Mathematics and Category and Type Theory.<p>`data` introduces an <i>algebraic data type</i>, so it makes sense to use data as a keyword. `type` and `newtype`, on the other hand, are programmer's conveniences: both carry no runtime cost, they are not actually part of the semantics of the backend language.<p>`map` is a function that's really just a specialization of `fmap`. Now, my category theory is a bit weak, but if I'm thinking correctly here, `fmap f` is an endofunctor in the category of <i>functors</i>, and so it makes perfect sense to call ""mappable"" Functor. There's also ""Traversable,"" which works pretty much like a fully-fledged ""mappable"" with all extras, but also requires a Functor instance.<p>Keywords, and idiosyncrasies of a syntactic nature are really just superficial. The actual elegance of the language is its type system. (The actual warts of the language are, for the most part, also in the type system; records for example.) The latter criticism about `mappable` is really just due to the fact that you haven't gotten used to the underlying theory (and I don't blame you, it's hard.) But getting used to it can be rewarding. I'm not saying it's going to make you a better programmer (I'm not necessarily of that opinion,) but it's rewarding in its own right.<p>Oh, and the difference between data constructors, type names, and, later, kind names (with promotion, since 7.4,) <i>can</i> be confusing.

All things being equal, it doesn't seem rational for a brand to just piss off it's customers for profit, as it's a bad long-term strategy that will severely damage the brand value/equity.<p>Perhaps it's because of the implied illegality, but I want to speak to the elephant in the room and offer that simply ignoring the fact that there is a <i>massive</i> market of pirated Adobe Photoshop copies seems to be providing an incomplete picture.<p>I'm speculating, but willing to posit that the amount of Adobe Photoshop piracy will increase as a result of this decision.  Does design major Tim really want to shell out money for the creative cloud to get his weekend project off the ground?  I think it's intuitive that this increased piracy would make Adobe less money, but I think the counter is true.  They've clearly adopted this strategy because they think they're on to <i>something</i> and any marketing idiot would realize this would piss off their core base, get legit users to pirate, etc.  So why would they do it?<p>Professionals like yourself and myself shelling out money for legitimate Photoshop copies are burdened by the fact that this tremendous amount of piracy exists.  Pirates will be pirates, so it's unlikely that you're going to get a pirate to switch their behavior and suddenly gain a new customer; thus I suspect Photoshop's got a finite supply of legitimate photoshop customers, and while it could even be increasing over time it might not be growing at a rate that is in-line with performance expectations (e.g. the adoption curve has hit some inflection point).  If Adobe wants to get more money out of Photoshop sales, it's got to look to its existing customer base and find ways of excising more funds overall, and hopefully with more regularity.<p>I'm not arguing that this piracy isn't effective; indeed, many users are likely legitimate users of Photoshop now exactly because pirated copies made Photoshop training so available despite the high cost for a professional license.  I'm not even trying to even make any claims about the ethics involved in piracy.<p>I'm simply saying that Adobe's business model likely has to look at its adoption rates and its quarterly revenues, and might only see a few options given the reality of the situation. I think this could signal why it doesn't matter that Adobe is pissing off their core base of customers.  These customers don't have any viable alternative as you've stressed, so they're locked into the feudalism of Adobe, who's really left with no other monetization strategy other than squeezing out more from existing customers than it can.",1368256387

5689976,comment,5688803,5689412,5,0,derleth,,,"To amplify what another has said, the emphasis of functional programming is side-effect-free code, where the default assumption is that functions don't have side effects, and so can be treated as components in a pipeline that modifies data step-by-step from its initial input state to its final output state.<p>Ideally, these components are composable and reusable, both to facilitate reasoning about the code and code reuse. The Haskell Standard Prelude is a fantastic example of this working out well.<p>Basically, it's based on the idea that the functions which are easiest to reason about are those with one well-defined input and one well-defined output which is completely determined by that input. You can't always have this, but functional languages attempt to get you as close as possible. The simplicity of pipeline-style programming is one of the happy little dividends of this kind of thinking.",1368256094

5689965,comment,5680258,5688039,2,0,L0j1k,,,"You make a good point here, and it's true that I shop around for ""the right kind"" of client. I read an article some years ago (on HN) about firing terrible clients at the same time we were having trouble with one client in particular. I resolved to never even negotiate with a client that I think is going to cause problems for myself or my team. We haven't looked back, and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made for the company. When a potential client starts insisting on this magic time/money saving thing called WordPress even after I explain my concerns, I know that they're probably not a good fit and start recommending other developers in the area that we know that do quality work with WordPress. And there is absolutely no shortage of those kinds of developers, so the client will end up getting what they want.<p>On security, the custom code we have written and deploy for our customers is stuff that I trust, because it's something we built ourselves and are extremely familiar with. Our products also come with a built-in automated ""security service"" that helps tremendously in keeping us from being the lowest-hanging fruit. Importantly, not even using WordPress immediately shuts down the near-constant traffic on the internet devoted to finding insecure WP deployments. While I completely agree that a WordPress deployment in the right hands can be as secure as anything out there, I don't trust the codebase in general, and certainly not as much as I trust my own code, despite there being a large number of coders sifting through WP. And all bets are always off if an attacker gains entry into the hosting provider.<p>As a specific example, WordPress doesn't use PDO at all, instead using the mysql_ functions (not even mysqli_). This is a pretty glaring problem from my point of view. The excuse WP core developers have used is that it's basically too tightly-coupled to use anything but MySQL (and specifically the mysql_ functions). That's a pretty big red flag to me, when a developer says that their product is too tightly-coupled to stop using functions that have been officially deprecated in the language for quite a long time. In fact, the feature request for PDO in WP is a kind of in-joke to outsiders (<a href=""http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663</a>).<p>Also (and importantly), I don't sell myself as a WordPress developer, but as a custom web and mobile applications developer. I have done this intentionally so that I won't succumb to the temptation to start rolling out quick and dirty WP deployments, but instead focusing on providing a custom-built, quality product that I can honestly say they can trust to function well and function securely for a long time to come.",1368255730

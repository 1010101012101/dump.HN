9920860,comment,9917773,9920757,0,0,jarcane,,,"Do notation.<p>Haskell&#x27;s do notation is syntactic sugar over monads which effectively allows you to write &#x27;imperative-looking&#x27; code while still carrying a local state forward without mutation. The Wikibook[1] does a pretty good example of explaining what this looks like (though I&#x27;m guessing you already know this).<p>Now, obviously it is true that <i>one</i> of do notation&#x27;s advantages is the same as any other monad usage: it allows us to explicitly sequence events in a lazy language that otherwise offers no (obviously intuitive) guarantees on evaluation order. In that sense it&#x27;s nothing more than sugaring over the otherwise necessary usage of a lot of ugly >> and >>= operators everywhere in increasingly annoying indentation.<p>But the other thing it offers is a syntactic sugaring over carrying state forward into successive computations (like the State monad[2]), which still carries at least some useful sweetness in a language that is otherwise functionally pure, which is why F# generalized the concept even further to computation expressions[3].<p>Looked at another way, do notation, or something like it, can be used to sugar over something that rather more looks like the Clojure ->/->> operators, where the initial value is essentially a local namespace. Much like the threading macros, the result even <i>appears</i> to be doing a kind of mutation, even though it&#x27;s actually doing nothing of the sort.<p>This kind of thing turns out to be useful for games, for instance, as the linked State monad example above does. In games we often have a main update loop, where we have to do several successive operations on our game that might change the state. We can do this a number of ways, but one way is with something like do notation, where for instance (in some hypothetical language) we might do this:<p><pre><code>  do with gameState
    oldGame <- gameState
    gameState <- checkInput
    gameState <- tick
    if gameState != oldGame
      draw
</code></pre>
And all of this kind of &quot;fake mutation&quot; can be handled underneath the sugar in a purely functional manner. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been meaning to put into Heresy for some time. Heresy uses continuation based loops that have a &quot;carry value&quot;, that can be passed from one cycle to the next. It&#x27;s a simple matter of some macro magic to then layer over this some syntax sugar that makes that carry value effectively a name space, that can be altered from one statement to the next, but all entirely without actual mutation underneath.<p>You can write whole imperative, mutation-riddled languages in purely functional ones this way. There&#x27;s an implementation of BASIC that runs in the Haskell do notation.[4]<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation</a>

9920859,comment,9917773,9920757,0,0,pimeys,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Monads in Scala for not throwing wild exceptions, but still being able to stop the computation immediately if needed. For example you want to validate things with a Validation[A] type, which can either be Valid or Invalid. The binding function in Scala is called flatMap, so flatMap for a Valid value returns a lambda having the included value as the parameter and Invalid doesn&#x27;t have a function call, so the flatMap operation stops.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  Valid(&quot;userId&quot;).flatMap(userId =>
    Invalid(&quot;address&quot;).map(address => User(id = userId, address = address))
</code></pre>
would stop for the address validation, because the flatMap for a Validation is specified as:<p><pre><code>  def flatMap[B](f: A => Validation[B]): Validation[B] = this match {
    case Valid(value) => f(value)
    case Invalid(value) => Invalid(value)
  }
</code></pre>
and map for a Validation is specified as:<p><pre><code>  def map[B](f: A => B): Validation[B] = this match {
    case Valid(value) => Valid(f(value))
    case Invalid(value) => Invalid(value)
  end
</code></pre>
And of course we can have a bit of syntactic sugar to not nest dozens of flatmaps, in Scala we use for:<p><pre><code>  for {
    userId <- Valid(&quot;userId&quot;)
    address <- Invalid(&quot;address&quot;)
  } yield {
    User(id = userId, address = address)
  }
</code></pre>
Now in the main function we can handle the Valid and Invalid with pattern matching and look, we can stop the computation without throwing exceptions, which makes testing and everything way simpler.",1437461849

9920849,comment,9917773,9920301,0,0,anon4,,,"Haskell is a pure language. Purity is a concept that is absolutely bizarre to the real world, where adding two numbers together results in tons of side effects (load into registers, oops, have to load cache lines, alter memory, raise the ambient temperature, etc. etc.). However, the idea of pure functions is useful. So we make our basic program blocks from pure functions that don&#x27;t &quot;do&quot; stuff, but just transform values.<p>However, we must chain these into useful programs somehow. Monad is the type name chosen in Haskell for the construct that does this. It&#x27;s kind of simple if you work it backwards from the syntax. You want to be able to say<p><pre><code>    do
      a <- readInt
      b <- readInt
      add a b
      print
</code></pre>
The first two can fail, rely on side effects and the last one is purely a side effect. The only pure function is add, which can&#x27;t work if a or b aren&#x27;t there. Monads serve as a way to represent the real-world-ness without it seeping into the add function. You can think of each line as a closure getting the next value from the previous line. So readInt returns a Maybe Int. If it returns a Nothing, the next closure is simply skipped. You can insert a check after the add, if you want to, to see if you got Nothing and alert the user, etc. However, the basic idea is that the program does not crash with a NullPointerException. We know what to do if we get Nothing. The add function doesn&#x27;t need to concern itself with that.<p>Hence, the Monad. It wraps a real world concern around a type (it has a type constructor). You must be able to make one from a concrete value that is unburdened with exceptional state (it has the unit function). You must be able to call pure functions on these monadic values without the side state seeping into the function (it has the bind function).<p>Edit: the reason you don&#x27;t see Monads in other languages is because they&#x27;re not essential to them. You can do stuff in C without Monads. To Haskell, Monads are like the Higgs boson. It&#x27;s how you bind stuff together.",1437461601

9920847,comment,9916460,9919168,0,0,jaawn,,,"As I&#x27;ve been trying to explain, the issue is with the secrecy and broken promise/contract because it puts one person&#x27;s interests ahead of the other.  If you disagree with that kind of relationship, that is fine...don&#x27;t agree to enter into one.  If you are in one and you find it is no longer what you want, that is fine too...tell your partner and proceed how you wish.<p>I am not applying any overly austere morals here.  I think you would be hard-pressed to successfully argue that an affair in the traditional sense is not an immoral act.  If you promise to be &quot;faithful&quot; to someone, and you break that promise and try to hide it, it is immoral based on <i>most</i> people&#x27;s morals and understanding.<p>Sure, you might disagree with popular morals, that&#x27;s fine.  However, a relationship involves <i>two</i> people, and both should be valued equally.  If one person thinks it is fine to break their promise and cheat in secret, so they do it despite knowing how the other person feels...they are putting themselves first.  They are not treating both they and their partner as equals.  That is the issue.  It has nothing to do with some sort of ideological anti-affair &quot;beliefs.&quot;  It is simple respect.<p>I guess it is even technically &quot;fine&quot; to think you deserve more liberty than others, or that you think others&#x27; feelings don&#x27;t matter as much as your desires (I&#x27;m not saying you do, I&#x27;m speaking generally).

9920846,comment,9920121,9920779,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I think you&#x27;re both finding different things to appreciate and dislike when comparing Unix-like systems to Windows.<p>Unix-like systems really are relatively stable, in terms of, once you get it working, it will generally continue to work. And, for the majority of superficial commands you might want to run -- ps, top, uptime, w, tcpdump, vi, pico, nano, mail, etc. -- there haven&#x27;t been many big changes for decades. Somebody that was pretty handy with BSD or Linux in 1995 could still find their way around the commandline on most systems today. They&#x27;d have to figure out newer init systems and a few other things, and the popular windowing environments have changed <i>a lot</i>, but basic CLI stuff is pretty stable.<p>But you&#x27;re right, trying to get these systems to work in the first place, or trying to keep them up to date without incurring significant cost or downtime, can really be a pain. I&#x27;ve experienced the same. I think the worst offender to date was Samba; at one time, Samba 3 could do file shares with Winbios authentication but not talk ActiveDirectory, and Samba 4 could talk ActiveDirectory but not do file shares (or some such thing, it&#x27;s been a few years), and they were both being released at the same time, so if you wanted a Samba server in an SBS 2008 environment you had to run both -- on two different systems. And configuring either one of them successfully was an absolute nightmare. I still have a text file under my Documents/sysadmin/ directory that has some shorthand notes on troubleshooting Samba installations and that thing is a gold mine. Every couple of years, after I&#x27;ve forgotten everything about Samba, I get a call to fix one that&#x27;s not working. I&#x27;d never be able to do it without those notes.<p>That&#x27;s just one example; I&#x27;ve had lots of issues with Network Manager (&quot;Network Mangler&quot;), print drivers that require 32-bit OS support which, once installed, completely bones other software updates and installations; OS updates that irreversibly break a working Apache installation (that one required me to pull a 24-hour shift building a new server), and yes, trouble with systemd/journald. All kinds of fun stuff.<p>It&#x27;s a mixed bag. Windows-based systems usually just work, as long as you throw expensive enough hardware at them. They either do a job or they don&#x27;t. But they aren&#x27;t very fixable. There&#x27;s no advanced logging system in the Windows environment, so whether you have any logs to work with in the event of trouble is entirely up to the individual software vendor, error messages are opaque, and I can&#x27;t just go grep some source code to try to figure out what the hey is going on. Linux and BSD systems are a lot more fixable, I generally prefer working on them, but they have some of the <i>worst</i> quirky little bugs caused by software affecting other software, and documentation still leaves a lot to be desired.",1437461520

I don&#x27;t think the problem can be solved with better techniques. I think the problem is humans just aren&#x27;t smart enough to do the work. There is a fundamental limit to how much you can compress certain things. It&#x27;s called the algorithmic complexity of the thing. Some things are just complicated. Some things are just large and hairy which ever way you turn them, whichever basis you construct. This is why we are spinning our wheels, why the next big architectural technique never lives up to the hype. There comes a point where the complexity of the thing you are trying to construct exceeds the capacity of any network of human beings to construct. I think there is a way to go with tooling, freeing people from the overhead of mundane work, which fractures people thinking time and reduces the complexity of the things that they can hold in their head at any one point in time. But the fundamental limit remains. I think ML is going to be the next big tool set. It will allow us to add layers of perception over the code and allow us to perceive the code and problems in different ways, freeing us to think at a higher level. But the fundamental limit remains. What we need is the ability to not just apply the human mind, with it&#x27;s 20watts of power, but to open up a multi megawatt power station on the problems. We need genuine AI and I think this should be our main focus, not pissing around with little problems around the edge, not building the next phone app. Every other programmer and scientist in the entire fucking world should be working on AI.",1437460837

If you accept that it is possible to build a such an AI, then you should, at the very least, educate yourself on the existential risks it would pose to humanity. I recommend &quot;Superintelligence:  Paths, Danger, Strategies,&quot; by Nick Bostrom (it&#x27;s almost certainly where Musk got his ideas; he&#x27;s quoted on the back cover).<p>The reason we ought to be cautious is that in a hard-takeoff scenario, we could be wiped from the earth with very little warning.

Essentially, AI poses a direct existential threat to humanity if it is not implemented with extreme care.<p>The more relevant question today is whether or not a true general AI with superintelligence potential is achievable in the near future. My guess is no, but it is difficult to predict how far off it is. In the worst-case scenario, it will be invented by a lone hacker and loosed on an unsuspecting world with no warning.",1437459751

Different people got into power in different countries in different ways and are kept in power by different means. Switching out the hierarchy that&#x27;s in power seems healthy for a society, and happens every once in awhile, as well (e.g. in Nigeria&#x27;s recent election).<p>I don&#x27;t think we should expect politicians to be altruistic and I think democracy is a spectrum. America has a somewhat democratic system, although almost half the eligible people don&#x27;t vote, and a large portion of the population that does vote appears to mirror campaign spending, which is controlled by a much smaller, but still relatively diverse number of donors. Increasing the number of people with enough discretionary spending to give to campaigns makes this system more democratic, as does lowering the max amount an individual can contribute.<p>Perhaps one day we will have a society where everyone contributes ideas evenly to this distributed system that is democratic government, but for now, I think it&#x27;s important simply to look for steps in that direction - get more people thinking and talking about political ideas, understanding the issues, and weighing the consequences of their vote.<p>Personally, I find the electoral college system the biggest barrier to engaging people... &quot;what does it matter, our state is going for candidate X anyway&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think the IC uses their capabilities to advise campaigns or blackmail dissidents anymore.

So does Standard ML. In these languages a monads would be a useless, redundant abstraction which will only clutter the code.",1437458642

But here goes: I think it is question begging to call CS a new liberal art without qualifying why (many people go for CS precisely because its practical). And its also unfair to think that a person cannot be intellectually devoted to a practical field (law is a pragmatic degree yes but its a love affair for a supreme court judge, why not the same for a business professor?) I think its more anti-intelectual to rank disciplines based on merit.",1437458504
9920749,comment,9917773,9920120,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"The simplicity is an illusion. While monads are not complex, the concept is very abstract relative to the imperative languages most people program in.<p>Think about it. In python there&#x27;s really no syntactic sugar to place something in a container, so the concept doesn&#x27;t really exist in python until you invent it using other python language primitives. So when you tell a python guy about a burrito, he really has no language analogue to think about. When I tried to learning about the maybe monad, I looked up a tutorial that taught it in python... Big mistake. I was thinking why the hell would people go out of there way to wrap that shit up in a burrito when they can just do a goddamn try exception...  It made no sense to me, and even now, it still doesn&#x27;t make sense for python. Only when I learned about haskell did I realize how the maybe monad makes sense for haskell.<p>I think most people learn about monads through haskell or any other language with a similar type system. It&#x27;d be interesting to hear peoples&#x27; experiences about how they grokked the concept.",1437458439

Not merely because of the way it jumps to conclusions from a single study (the discourse on Reddit/Twitter is likely to be somewhat different than in Halo 3), but because the article itself was about <i>online harassment</i>, and yet the only figure they deigned to include was about the number of <i>positive</i> comments.<p>If you look at the graphs for <i>negative</i> statements[2], you find that although female voices provoke slightly more negative comments for low amounts of deaths, male voices get significantly more negative comments when the death count is higher.

337667,comment,337404,337627,0,0,jwilliams,,,"May be the case - but in my experience, issues of scale don't creep up on you - one day hit a hard limit and your service is crashing all the time.<p>.. And if you haven't thought about it - this can happen at any volume. I've seen apps that test great with 5 users and then bomb when you get 3 more.<p>Just my experience. Not saying as an overall <i>strategy</i> it's not a good idea - as a business this might very well be an effective model - just saying that ignoring it technically is a bad one.",1224485753

337664,comment,337080,337258,0,0,lutorm,,,"There was a good article posted here a couple of days ago (can't find the link now) that argued that the difference is that the government can afford to buy the assets at above the market rate, because they can take a long-term view and hold them to maturity. The banks can't do that, though, they must value at market value and need to be able to trade them at a reasonable rate. The question then, of course, is how to estimate the hold-to-maturity value.<p>Buying them up at market rate, as you say, would just make all the businesses fail. The whole problem is that the market value is almost certainly not an accurate indicator of the intrinsic value of these investments at the moment.",1224485400

337653,comment,337546,337546,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>In 10 years computers will be able to use a combination of artificial intelligence and massed data from the Internet to generate music better than human musicians.</i><p>One can see how this conversation might drive one straight up a wall.<p>""Better"" in what sense? In the sense that recorded music is more definitive and consistent than live performance? Or that synthesized tones are more accurately pitched and timed than the sounds from a Stradivarius? Or does he mean better in the sense that it is more satisfying to win a chess game against a 3200-rated computer than against the merely 2851-rated Garry Kasparov? Or better to watch a dolphin race another dolphin than to watch a slow, human swimmer like Michael Phelps race against other slow, human swimmers?<p>Humans prefer other humans. Though we like all kinds of things, for most people the sight and sound of other humans has a special, extra level of fascination. So I seriously doubt that AIs will ever successfully compete with human musicians, except as occasional fads, in selected genres and niches (they make pretty good ambient music), or in disguise. The problem is not that any specific musical feat is impossible for a machine (humans are themselves machines, after all). Rather, the problem is that humans control the metagame: Sooner or later, subtly or overtly, we will change the rules arbitrarily so that only humans can be fully human in our eyes.<p>Indeed, it's all we can do to prevent ourselves from redefining <i>other humans</i> (except those who are our own close relatives) as undesirable aliens -- if you doubt this, just talk to a member of a local minority group.<p>In such an environment I don't think AIs stand a chance in hell except as part of a cyborg team in which humans front for them. And, in music, we will call those humans ""professional musicians""!",1224482754

7805404,comment,7804198,7804774,2,0,hluska,,,"> Specifically, what discrete banking options should be available if someone is homeless, owes child support, and maybe has open warrants someplace.<p>I used to publish a street paper and have been trying to solve this problem for the past six years. Street papers are theoretically great because they solve many of the problems associated with homelessness. However, their efficacy is being cut because more and more people don&#x27;t carry cash. Unfortunately, to take part in a cash free economy, you need things like a bank account, credit, or a device.<p>Another problem was cash management. We would launch an issue and out vendors would start selling. Then, after four hours, they might have made $80. This was problematic because some of the problems that lead to homelessness can usually be exacerbated by a sudden surge of cash.<p>In my experience, paranoia and/or fear of the system is the biggest barrier to discrete banking. Homeless people are disproportionately affected by laws banning camping in public parks, or that &#x27;close&#x27; public parks at 11pm. When society continuously passes laws making it harder for you to live, it doesn&#x27;t take long before it&#x27;s hard to trust society. Add in schizophrenia (which is an epidemic amongst homeless populations), and banking is very hard.<p>Some of the ideas we came up with include:<p>- selling ads to cover 100% of the magazine&#x27;s cost, thn &#x27;selling&#x27; the paper to vendors for $1 a copy. We&#x27;d hold this amount collected in our bank account and hand it out on request. We abandoned this idea because it felt too much like enabling addictive behaviours.<p>- building a new payment card system. If you buy a magazine, you would put cash onto a vendor&#x27;s card. Then, we&#x27;d have a list of merchants (ie - grocery stores, landlords) who would accept it. Not only is this idea insanely difficult to pull off, but it attacks dignity. A loss of dignity is a cause of continuing homelessness.<p>This entire question is complex and if you explore it deeply enough, you quickly run up against money laundering/banking regulations. But, if we can solve it, we can solve a huge problem.<p>Consider social assistance cheques. If you don&#x27;t have a bank account, you have to use cheque cashing services instead. Cheque cashing companies charge a large premium to cash cheques. In the case of government cheques, there is virtually no risk other than counterfeiting.<p>Thanks for bringing this up!",1401209597

7805339,comment,7796192,7803036,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"This has become a response of some length, so I&#x27;ll put a quick summary up front:<p>- From the perspective of linguistics, a &quot;language&quot; and a &quot;dialect&quot; are essentially the same thing; which word is used is a political question, not a scientific one.<p>- One common method of assigning different meanings to &quot;language&quot; vs &quot;dialect&quot; is to say that if person A and person B can communicate using A-speak and B-speak, then A-speak and B-speak are both dialects of the same language. On this approach, Mandarin and Cantonese are separate languages, and e.g. Beijinghua is a dialect of Mandarin.<p>---------<p>I understand that Mandarin, Minnan, Wu, Yue, etc etc etc aren&#x27;t all the same thing. That wasn&#x27;t what I meant. If the question is &quot;are Mandarin and Cantonese the same language?&quot;, it&#x27;s easy to demonstrate, e.g. by having two people attempt to communicate, that they aren&#x27;t.<p>Consider an alternative question, &quot;are Mandarin Chinese and my quilt the same thing?&quot; It should be clear that they aren&#x27;t. Furthermore, they aren&#x27;t even the same <i>kind</i> of thing -- one is a quilt, and one is, in the context of comparing it to a quilt, clearly a language. We can distinguish the language from the quilt by many tests: one has a physical instantiation (the quilt), and from that many ancillary properties like color, weight, size, rigidity, and so forth; the language is more of a hypothetical concept with no physical object that represents it, but can be conceived of as a tool for communication much as the quilt is a tool for keeping warm. All normal humans over the age of four &quot;possess&quot; one or more languages; many lack quilts.<p>So, if we keep the question &quot;is this thing that I&#x27;m considering a language, or not?&quot; in our minds... the point of my earlier rhetorical question is that there is no distinction to be drawn between Cantonese and Mandarin that would be relevant <i>to that question</i>. Any evidence you adduce to support the idea that Mandarin is a language will apply just as well to Cantonese, and vice versa.<p>> But then how would you explain the relationship between Chinese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Teochew, etc in terms of language vs. dialect?<p>&quot;Dialect&quot;, like &quot;species&quot;, is not a perfectly well-defined concept. Some people (not me) like the ecological species concept (which I will rudely characterize as &quot;two animals are the same species if an ecologist tells you so&quot;), and some (most) prefer the biological species concept, which says that two animals are the same species if they can mate and produce viable, fertile offspring (as far as I can tell, the requirement of a single generation of fertility is there specifically to stop donkeys and horses from being the same species under this concept; the occasional fertile mule is handled by the traditional fingers-in-the-ears method).<p>Analogously, it&#x27;s common to say that two, um, &quot;modes of speaking&quot; A and B are dialects of the same language if a person speaking A can carry on a conversation with a partner speaking B. By this view, a &quot;language&quot; is a very abstract concept, less physically real than a &quot;dialect&quot; in the same way that a dialect is less physically real than a quilt. The way any person speaks, which though massless is something you can measure in the world, is a dialect, and a language is a group of dialects which are all mutually intelligible.<p>Like the biological species concept, this has some issues; for example, it tends to suggest that Spanish and Italian are dialects of the same language. This is felt to be politically unfortunate, but from a facts-based perspective things could be a lot worse -- Spanish and Italian are known to be closely related, both recent descendants of Latin.<p>So to answer your question:<p>&quot;Chinese&quot; is a term with no clear meaning, usually synonymous with Mandarin. The structure of the word indicates that it refers to the language of China, but as there&#x27;s more than one that&#x27;s not very useful. Mandarin, Yue, Wu, Min, Hakka and so on are all &quot;languages&quot; (or &quot;language families&quot;), and Shanghaihua is a dialect of Wu, Beijinghua is a dialect of Mandarin, Guangdonghua is a dialect of Yue, etc.  You can read more here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese</a><p>All of these language families share an obvious (well, depending on your perspective) similarity because they descend from Middle Chinese, just as French and Italian share similarity because of their common descent from Latin.",1401208877

It also correlated with my high test scores, creativity, and inability to focus on &quot;boring&quot; work.<p>When I became a vegetarian at age 15, it was as much a reaction to my surroundings (an Iowa farm town) and worldview as anything else. As a creative, bright, curious, kid, possibly dealing with low levels of depression, it&#x27;s not too surprising that by 1986 I was a massive fan of The Smiths.

When I worked at Target, 2 people threw boxes onto rollers, 5-6 people sorted the boxes onto pallets organized by area of the store as they went by, 2 people rolled those pallets onto the sales floor and threw each box in front of the appropriate aisle, and ~20 people opened the boxes and stocked the shelves.  The 2 people unloading the truck could always keep <i>well</i> ahead of the 20 on the sales floor.<p>* An alternate strategy might be to sort the boxes into pallets by store area at the distribution center rather than at the store.  You might get some economies of scale out of doing this process for 100 stores at 1 distribution center, but it may still not be worth it to put all that needed floor space, latency, and congestion in what I imagine is already a very congested point in the supply chain.

The problem is your romaine from that hydro farm down the road is $3.99, and from the traditional farm shipped across the country is $1.99.  Lights are a big part of the equation.  Most plants need 10+ hours of sunlight a day, so even if you put the plants on a rotisserie you still have to supplement with artificial light ($$$).\nThe amount of water and land you save is immense, however, the water and land cost of putting a farm in an urban area counters that.<p>Pollination is easy - bees. Even basement/garage growers will use bees to pollinate.  That said, you don&#x27;t need bees in this example as you never want lettuce (or any leafy green) to flower.  You can control the flowering with reduced temp and different light temperatures, too.\nIn tomato/pepper/fruiting plants, you&#x27;ll need manual pollination or a beehive in your hydro-warehouse.<p>Re: super-organic - Most hydroponic growing is not organic.  By nature of adding nutrients (fertilizer, salts, ph adjustments) that replace what is found in soil means hydroponics is traditionally not organic.  There are organic hydroponics going on (I am not aware of a large-scale one) and they are NOT clean nor bug free, given the nature of making organic nutrients (they smell like shit, really, as most are compost or something-rotting-based).",1401207099

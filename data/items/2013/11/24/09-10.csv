6789230,comment,6787898,6788884,3,0,gnerd,,,"> I am aware of the usage of like in the simile context. Thank you for your concern however.<p>First off, apologies if you took that as an insult, it wasn&#x27;t meant that way, I just didn&#x27;t want my words to be twisted and lose the original meaning that I was making a comparison to a value increase of a given stock or commodity, using an IPO as an example.<p>> I don&#x27;t believe that there are any currencies, which when launched, were purely floating without any bands or a peg.<p>I understand the point and I believe it to be correct, but only to a point (national currencies, BitCoin is not one of those). This is why I was mentioning commodity currencies. See gold isn&#x27;t backed by anything, we use it because of historical significance. I understand you may say, it has value because of its conductive properties and use in chips but originally we actually used it as a currency because it a) was useless to make tools out of as it is a soft metal b) did not oxidise like other metals at the time c) was scarce.<p>Once we abstracted value to gold (or other precious metals), we used it to solve the coincidence of wants problem and that is what a currency does. Obviously I know you know about the gold standard that followed and how it was subsequently abandoned but it is important to note that I can still a) store value in gold b) exchange gold for goods and services.<p>Take South Africa (where a third of the gold ever mined comes from). They mint KrugerRands (gold) and they mint their national currency (Rands). Rands might depreciate in value due to low international demand and KrugerRands might appreciate in value due to high international demand (for gold) but both are a currency and South Africans can pay their taxes with those KrugerRands (using the spot price of the gold value converted to Rands). The same applies to Federally minted gold coins, they have value all over the world as a medium of exchange (based on the gold value) and I can pay taxes in the US with them as they are legal tender.<p>There is no peg for these gold coins, they are worth what the market says they are worth. Should you have gotten in on the ground floor with gold, you would have been a very rich man using something that was considered interesting but ultimately useless some time before. Obviously that wasn&#x27;t really an option as this story unfolded over a very long time, but we know that is no longer the case in an ever connected world. Changes that once took centuries can happen inside of a decade now (interestingly enough, although valuable at the time, the fortune gained by Mayer Amschel Rothschild with gold in the late 18th century was not the largest fortune ever gained, once the gold standard was adopted in the 19th century, it was probably the largest fortune in the modern world, by far. Something his descendants still benefit from to this day).<p>> Continuing the question, are there any currencies that are pegged to a basket which includes commodities?<p>Yes. I think we are confusing currency with national currency though and I have beaten that dead horse already.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure if you were referencing the Kuwaiti Dinar as one of those.<p>I was referring to the Kuwaiti Dinar being a success in terms of value fluctuation. I used it as an example because I made money with it once and it is regarded as the strongest national currency (although not a major currency). It was pegged to the pound originally and the pound devalued 6 years after. The value appreciation is nothing like BitCoin but to me, BitCoin is closer to gold than a national currency, as I said.<p>> Very sorry if my English was not clear enough to express my question in the initial format. In the future I&#x27;ll be sure to elucidate the question better rather <i>then</i> assuming the reader is able to follow along with the simile from the parent comment.<p>I think you mean &quot;than&quot; :p (just kidding, don&#x27;t get offended).<p>All jokes aside, I think one thing that is missing from all these discussions is that the value of BitCoin (at least as it seems to me) isn&#x27;t that you use it as a primary national currency (although I suppose it could serve that purpose in some places), but rather that it might be a contender for an international currency that mitigates inflation risks (which in recent years is what China[1][2] and Russia[3] have been pushing for, since 2009, year of BitCoin&#x27;s inception) because right now the USD as a reserve currency seems a bit unfair to people outside of the US (and a few other nations). Say I want to buy barrels of oil, most of the world oil is denominated in USD. That is great for Americans because it keeps the dollar strong but if I am in say, Indonesia, it ultimately decreases demand for my currency, putting me at a disadvantage just to keep my economy running.<p>All that is not to say I believe the success of BitCoin is guaranteed (far from it), or that this is the role BitCoin will take, but key players have suggested it has been China&#x27;s intention all along (by buying more gold than any other country on the planet), to create (or at least push) a new supranational currency. This century is almost certain to have a supranational currency adopted as a standard (SDR&#x27;s don&#x27;t really satisfy that niche).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bis.org/review/r090402c.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bis.org/review/r090402c.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vancouversun.com/Business/asia-pacific/China+yuan+makes+waves+international+currency/9123015/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vancouversun.com/Business/asia-pacific/China+yuan...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/16/bric-medvedev-currency-idUSLG42629320090616"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/16/bric-medvedev-curr...</a>",1385286582

I can solder 0603 surface-mount devices without magnification, and I have below-average vision and drink way too much caffeine.<p>More importantly, I think it&#x27;s the correct solution to this problem.  If moving the wire around results in the sound cutting off, you don&#x27;t have a good connection.  Holding the wire against the connector mechanically is a fine short-term solution, but it&#x27;s just going to break again, no matter how much epoxy you use.  (Though a thinner 2-part epoxy might have better results than Suguru.  Clamp the work in a position where you know the wires make good contact, pour epoxy into the gap, or a mold you make out of paper or something, and then wait for it to cure.)  Soldering on a new connector will ensure that you have a good mechanical and electrical connection.  Add some suguru for extra strain relief, if you must, and you probably won&#x27;t be repairing the headphones again.<p>I&#x27;ll also suggest just throwing the headphones away and spending $10 on a new pair, unless these are like $2000 custom molded for your ears, or something.",1385286119

To &#x27;us&#x27; (in the EU in this case) it just seems weird that when there is acted sex and fuck-and-such in a movie during daytime on normal (not pay tv) television, in the US this is considered porn, is beeped away or not aired in the first place. You don&#x27;t call that prude; while no-one here would blink an eye, young or old, over there it needs to be censored? How is that anti-Americanism and how is it not weird?",1385284366

In my capacity as a Wikipedia admin, I&#x27;ve handled copyright-related issues with images and text.<p>We put an enormous amount of volunteer labour into tracking copyright violations and removing them: if a photographer complains that someone has uploaded a copyright violation, our volunteers will go and forensically examine EXIF data, look at upload metadata on sites like Flickr, check for digital watermarks, check on Google Images and other search tools to try and trace the upload history of the image. And even after all that work, it still feels like it&#x27;s not quite good enough.<p>On image licensing, I&#x27;ve emailed government lawyers to verify that our interpretation of their national copyright policies is correct.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve worked with people in the commercial sector whose modus operandi for producing social media campaigns is &quot;open up Google Images/Flickr/YouTube and pinch all the things!&quot;<p>If I can trace the copyright claims on an image by using tools like Google Image Search, so can AFP and Getty. Not just for copyright purposes, but due diligence to make sure the metadata checks out with the photojournalistic claim made of the image. That they aren&#x27;t doing so ought to give one pause before trusting agencies like AFP to report the news.",1385284291

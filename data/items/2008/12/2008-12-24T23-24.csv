409248,comment,408836,409231,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I'm one anecdotal example of why Macs are sometimes worth the extra cash.<p>After being fed up with my old Toshiba laptop being crap, and their warranty department refusing to service (apparently bad fan bearings were ""wear and tear"" items), I splashed out for a top of the line MacBook Pro 2 years ago, and started experiencing problems soon after getting it - first the lid would refuse to close (the latch button got stuck), and then my HDD died. Anyhoo, long story short I sent it in twice, and in total got about 5 major parts replaced.<p>Rewind to 4 months ago, my machine was really on the fritz, VRAM was shot and would display random colors (textbook memory corruption). Below is everything that happened:<p>- Called Apple, waited <5 minutes for an agent.<p>- Gave the agent my info, and she immediately remarked that given my repair history I could qualify for a full replacement, and asked if I would like to proceed.<p>- Waited <5 minutes for tier 2 support.<p>- Tier 2 listened to my problem, got me to run some diagnostics to confirm my VRAM was shot, and after a few minutes authorized a full replacement, with a brand spanking new unibody MacBook Pro. I was handed off to a replacement rep via email and the shipping label was sent to me within an hour of hanging up.<p>- I have some projects in the pipe that I didn't want to put on ice for too long, so I called my rep after I shipped my old laptop off to explain, he sent the new one before even confirming with UPS that my old one was on the way back to Apple.<p>- That was Friday, it got here Tuesday - across a national border.<p>On this experience alone, and contrasted with the service I've received from Toshiba and Dell, Apple has basically cemented me as a repeat customer.",1230162275
409247,comment,408827,409217,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, RAID-Z is awesome, but probably not so useful in this case.<p>RAID-Z, among other things, is designed to offer parity (in a better implementation than traditional RAID parity).  But you probably don't care about that with EBS.  EBS volumes have an annual failure rate of 0.1%-0.5%.  Commodity disks have an annual failure rate of 4%.  That means that EBS is already taking care of parity in some way and you probably should worry about things other than that - like speed.<p>So, you could use RAID-Z to increase reliability (and it's a wonderful technology), but the speed of RAID-0 would be really nice for a good database server given that parity is taken care of.",1230161942

Yeah, the Chinese poor have it far worse than the poor in America - but at least their middle class is growing, not shrinking. Wealth is being generated for the everyman, and things are rapidly getting better for the average Joe.<p>Compared to the shrinking middle class in America as wealth flows upwards.<p>Don't get me wrong - I'm far from pro-Chinese, I'm just saying, let's not let the fact that there are starving people there prevent us from seeing our own faults.",1230161467

And FYI, Beijing and HK are plenty diverse.<p>I find your point here to be disingenuous. Because NYC has more people it is not comparable to other large cities in Asia? Because NYC serves citizens through democratic multi-tiered governments that this does not exist in Asia as well?

409234,comment,408786,409117,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I think you're losing the message he's trying to push - the wealthiest splinter of southeast Asia has created a beacon for talent to gather, for the rural poor to have something to aspire to (and many do, go to China and you will hear many of these success stories). Yes, the poorest of Chinese are still far poorer than the poorest of Americans, but what we're talking about is the ability for a country to forge ahead, something we haven't done for a while now. Take my (former) home country, Taiwan, for example - it has a massive, efficient, fast, and reliable public transport infrastructure that is both affordable and safe. This is country-wide. How many American cities can say the same? We are losing the war on infrastructure, which in the end means losing every other war that matters.<p>And to answer your question: yes we are. I will be graduating in a few months from a fairly good engineering school, and <i>many</i> of my fellow engineering majors are panicking - they all went down the financial engineering route instead of traditional electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering, and now they're all jobless. Before the big collapse of '08 there was definitely a large sense floating about campus that people who did ""real"" engineering were suckers. This is not an uncommon phenomenon.<p>Same thing back in high school - everyone guns for the big money. Tons of smart high school students went into business school instead of science or engineering, simply because one pays the bills, and the other not so much. My evidence is anecdotal, but this is based on observation from entire graduating classes.",1230161097
409233,comment,408901,409195,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> <i>Perhaps another monopolist would have come along.</i><p>There were certainly plenty of people who would have liked to dominated software the way Gates did. So, I agree, one of them might have succeeded. And if they did, the outcome would have been about that same as it was with Gates' dominance. In other words, we'd probably have been no worse off.<p>Could the alternative monopolist have been Steve Jobs? It's possible, though I think it's unlikely. Jobs' products have tended to be quirky (e.g. the original Mac had no expansion slot), with an NIH-flavour (e.g. Apple are about the only people who use Objective C), more expensive than the competition, and often locked-down (e.g. the iPhone will only run apps approved by Apple); all attributes that make mass adoption less likely. And Apple itself has often have the flavour of a religious cult about it.<p>This is not to denigrate Jobs: he's clearly a brilliant man, and Apple have clearly made some brilliant products. As opposed to Microsoft's products which tend towards the mediocre: they always work (sort-of) but are rarely inspiring.<p>So if there was an alternate monopolist, and it was Jobs, I think software technology would have progressed faster than it actually did.<p>Maybe Jobs isn't known for philanthopy, but that's irrelevant, since the original assertion was ""the magnitude of the impact Billy has had in their life"", and my life (and most HN readers' lives) has been changed more by technological advances in computing than by Gates' philanthopy.",1230161038

Market share isn't their problem, it's that they have to sell at a loss to maintain it.<p>The reason Toyota has all but caught up isn't that they're particularly innovative, it's that the Camry can have $2,000 worth of better build quality than the Taurus or Malibu.

409222,comment,408836,408836,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Owning a mac is still a cultural statement, like an Obama bumper sticker or worrying loudly about Global Warming in public. I even know poor humanities graduate students to pony up the extra $300 for a mac, because that's what they are <i>supposed</i> to own. Macs are common possessions of workers of DC non-profits, despite their meager salaries. It's a token that proclaims yourself to be part of the well-educated, hip, cool culture.<p>Owning a PC? That would be as much of a faux pas as owning a large vehicle, working a blue collar job, living in the suburbs, or voting republican. You certainly won't improve your chances of getting invited to the cool parties by doing that.<p>I do admire Apple for consciously making itself into a subcultural icon. Few brands are as successful as Apple. And as they have hooked themselves up to a subculture that is ascendant, it is a good strategic move.<p>Edit: It is possible that in the future that Apple will make the jump like Starbucks did to be a universal brand and not just a brand of the hip subculture. I consider Starbucks to be one of the greatest marketing successes of all time; at first a cool urban delicacy, later reaching the other half: the suburbs, the parents that may send their kids to the military but never to grad school, the PC owners, the small business owner (think ""Joe the Plumber"", not Steve Jobs), people who never worry about ""materialism"" or ""consumerism"",  the Republicans. Sarah Palin and Bono, investment bankers and environmentalists have their favorite latte. Of course, the cool hip culture tends to lead the rest, so that's a good strategic place to start.<p>I don't see any signs that Apple has made this jump yet. I certainly don't think my blue collar dad even considered a Mac when he bought a laptop, even though I am certain that he would have had an easier time learning its user interface.",1230160228

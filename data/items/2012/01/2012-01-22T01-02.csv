He's not talking about repurposing the domain for any of those things.<p>>A ""community"" cannot actually own a thing. Who exactly do you think should have the domain? Who represents ""the community""?<p>Once the community gets sufficiently large, a formal foundation like apache or the python software foundation. (Obviously for practicality it's fine for the domains of a smaller community to be owned by individuals, but they should act as custodians)<p>>And why exactly does this amorphous ""community"" have some special claim to one of an infinite number of domains that might be used for similar or entirely different purposes?<p>If you call your domain scala-tools and your site becomes known as a place to get scala tools you have a moral obligation to keep it about scala tools, or give it up and let someone else use the name. Doing otherwise would be cybersquatting - scala-lang may not be a single person's name, but it still means something.",1327197580

It also has the most voice acting of any game in history and it is the first MMOs that actually has a story for each player character that is worth following.<p>Modern Warfare 3 as an expansion is now arguing semantics. What makes it an expansion? Two years of development where they didn't really innovate but they continued to tightly tune their well oiled machine and CoD Elite is a great platform that almost every game would benefit from. Is it simply price you are annoyed with because you don't perceive the incremental improvements to be worth it? Modern Warfare 3 is definitely not going to push the video games industry forward in any major ways but Modern Warfare 1 & 2 have already done that.<p>As another poster has stated you're confusing Castle Crashers with something else. Castle Crashers is more like Battletoads or Double Dragon or River City Ransom.<p>The ""hardcare"" video game industry is moving forward albeit slowly.

3495344,comment,3492912,3492912,2,0,aaronmoodie,,,"I did some work in 2011 with a number of local bands, one of which has quite a big international following. This band recorded and produced their latest album themselves, yet despite this, still went to the major labels to release the album. I asked why they would do this since they own the copyright to their work and have a large enough following to get the coverage? Because the major labels still have the promotional might to reach more people. This was pretty much the only reason.<p>It was really interesting having an insight to the process as the band went along. I think I was most shocked at just how behind and locked in tradition the major labels really are. This was most evident in the actual release of the album. As I've mentioned, this band had recorded, produced and had artwork done when talks began. Despite this, the labels wanted to wait 4 months, 4 MONTHS, before releasing the album. Obviously, you can imagined what happend. The album ended up on torrent sites 2 months before it was released.<p>It's exactly this sort of unwillingness to change and adapt that has been undoing the major labels. The whole point of a digital file is that is can be distributed the second is it ready. If a digital version of the album had have been made available immediately, I sure a lot of fans would have bought it straight out. Instead, they get impatient and use a torrent site resulting in a loss of sales.<p>The main thing I took away form the whole experience is where we need to focus in order to remove these fools from the game. The music industry no longer has room for three players. Where once it was the band, label and fans, now it's just the bands and the fans. Major labels are only still relevant because they can offer something that the current suite of online tools can't, publicity. Work out a way to crowd source that, and bands will have no desire, or need, to approach a major label.<p>Just as a farmers market fosters and nurtures the relationship between producer and consumer, so to does the music industry need such a 'market' to foster direct relations between band and fan.",1327197154

He noticed that these companies tend to raise their fees basically in lock-step (when one does it, the others follow quickly).<p>This behavior seemed counter-intuitive to me -- I would have guessed that the companies would compete to keep fees low.  But this actually makes some sense in a world where the seller (the credit card company) reacts much more quickly than the buyer (the fee-paying banks and merchants).  Banks and merchants can only switch credit card issuers if they can get their customers to (i.e. the card-holders).  Therefore, it's possible for a card company to raise fees without losing market share right away.  Other card companies take note and their dominant strategy is to raise fees as well.",1327196970

Part of the problem is that it isn't really all on ""our"" side (if you read ""our"" to be the EFF side). We do have a fairly strong industry lobby of sorts already, the BSA, but it almost always takes the Hollywood side (and initially supported SOPA). I think, unfortunately, a lot of ""our"" companies just aren't on ""our"" side (Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, etc.), because of their MPAA-esque paranoia about piracy, jailbreaking, etc.<p>If it would be possible to make a professional association like the ACM take a stronger and more visible stance, imo that'd be a better approach, because the tech industry's <i>employees</i> are often intelligent, but the tech industry's <i>companies</i> would imo be more likely to just lobby as a special interest, not in any sort of enlightened way.

At most, all you should take from reading this paper is that ""cartels"" potentially can emerge without coordination, not that they do or that they are likely to. Or that this phenomenon has anything at all to do with the dynamics of prices at your neighborhood gas-station.<p>As anyone who has studied complex systems understands, the evolution of interactions among even very simple agents is enormously sensitive to initial conditions. (That's often taken as the very definition of chaos in deterministic systems.) So it is almost always wrong to draw strong conclusions about a complex part of the real world based on your computational model of it: vary one parameter a little bit and you end up with something that looks completely different.<p>This is why agent-based models, like the one employed in this study, are widely despised in economics and the other social sciences despite offering a way to do experiments that would otherwise be impossible in these fields. We simply don't know enough about people and how they interact to build meaningful models, and we probably never will.<p>For example, an economist might point out that the model presented in this paper doesn't account for the spacial distribution of gas stations and consumers, for buyers' and sellers' expectations of future prices, or for any number of conceivable and inconceivable factorsalmost all of which would affect aggregate outcomes in the model, I would bet, just as the authors found that the speed of reacting to price-changes did. (That was the only parameter the authors varied, by the way.) And of course we could model the problem in many fundamentally different ways to start with.<p>In other words, this is much different (and harder) than building an N-body model of the dynamics of Alpha Centauri, where's there's basically one force (gravity) that operates in the same way on a bunch of things that can all be described adequately by a single parameter (mass).",1327195697

It's a fucking conversion killer.<p>A large part of Greasemonkey's existence is due to how poorly architected extensions are -- the full restart, zero sandboxing, etc.<p>Webkit's native plugin API is really goddamn cool but I don't think any shipping software used it before ClickToFlash.",1267267879

Those will never produce the vast additional amounts of energy needed to make the next step in our general wellbeing. With cheap limitless energy, you can produce all the water you want, bind all the CO2 you want, produce all the O3 you want, recycle everything you want and even use fission to produce whatever materials you want.",1267267125
1155169,comment,1148079,1154361,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"It looks like it boils down to the restrictive clauses of the GPL. The reasoning is easy: BSD gives you total freedom. GPL gives you the 4 freedoms and some restrictions. Logical conclusion: the GPL is less free than the BSD.<p>This forgets a basic freedom principle however: ones's freedom must stop at other's. The GPL guarantees that you can't further restrict the freedoms it gave you. The BSD does not. Effectively, the BSD gives you the freedom to restrict other's freedoms. We have some examples of liberally licensed software which were more often distributed as proprietary software rather than as free software (IIRC, X was such an example). Therefore, when you look at the society as a whole, you could see that GPL software is <i>more</i> free than BSD software. (Now that companies see the practical advantages of Open Source, this effect is arguably weakened.)<p>My conclusion is that the GPL does a better job at promoting freedom than the BSD licence. To me that's what's matters. You may still disagree, but I'm out of arguments.<p>PS: Sorry for treating you like Microsoft, I got carried away.",1267267038

For example, I've seen the 60-ton Hoba meteorite in Namibia, and although the surface has corroded and oxidised, its bulk is definitely solid metal (mostly iron, some nickel).<p>It would still take some processing to separate the compounds, but nowhere near as much as ores.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoba_meteorite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoba_meteorite</a>",1267267016
1155167,comment,1154454,1154659,0,0,dpezely,,,"I would emphasize that the killer app for Lisp is simply programming.  ""Simply"" in the sense that you're unencumbered and not fenced in to any particular cliche such as Ruby being stereotyped in its association with Rails.<p>Ten years ago when deep into Python, I'd explain the language to others by including the disclaimer that you probably wouldn't want to use it for writing an OS.  Writing a near-deterministic scheduler in it ultimately motivated my return to Lisp.<p>I offer no such disclaimer when describing Common Lisp to other programmers, executives or founders at start-ups where I've used it.<p>Apparently, most people want to convince themselves of the value for a tool by citing something external.  To this end, it's likely that the success of EVE Online has helped Stackless/Python in terms of reputation.<p>I suspect everyone paid to write Lisp that I know would respond with something like: if you need that kind of external validation, then you probably don't know what you really need or want, so let's not wake the sleepwalker.<p>Maybe the sociological question has to do with why some people need/want that validation (killer app) versus those who don't.<p>For completeness and to preempt questions of what is the EVE equivalent for Lisp success stories: early days of NaughtyDog using GOAL, work at the University of Colorado and 2010 book, _Land of Lisp_, just to name a few.<p>But that will never be enough for people who prefer commodity languages for the sake of safety in numbers, as Lisp isn't commodity today.  More than just a bootstrapping issue or citing decline due to the AI winter, it may never reach critical mass to be commodity because so few individuals are involved with each success story.<p>That is, since you often need only a few developers when using Lisp, there's less need to evangelize when recruiting.  Job postings I've made have often been a single sentence mentioning Common Lisp and the city, which yielded very high quality people.<p>It's rather like what is said of big dogs: they don't bark nearly as much as little ones because there's nothing to prove.<p>For Lisp, questions of killer apps and becoming a mainstream or commodity language (again) is unfortunately impacted by this larger context.  Certainly, I would love to see my favorite language enjoying popular status.  In the end, however, it's rather like some explanations for the meaning of life: it's a personal quest, and the journey is part of the answer.  So too with deciding to use Lisp.  It's okay to break-away from the crowd.<p>This brings us back to one recurring theme of Justin's essays: Try it and decide for yourself.  Or Don't.<p>Regarding ""aversion to math,"" many developers unfortunately opt for the least they can get away with and retain only enough to pass exams or interview questions.  It's the difference between being able to recite versus being resourceful and the array of implications associated with each.  I suspect that statement is aimed at people who became programmers because it pays better than other directions the individual has considered.",1267266904

Your involvement could be more concealed if you were merely a stockholder or if the state where your business incorporates and any other state where your business is required to qualify to conduct business do not require that all directors and officers be disclosed.  Note:  You may be able to have a third-party serve as incorporator.

What the author was trying to show was how different regions adapt new technology.<p>In my ""world"" almost no one uses Twitter, 4square or any other new technology/tools. This means starting a new trend and getting early adapters (from within my social circle) is extremely hard.<p>Twitter could never get started here.
FourSquare would of never got enough usage to prove the concept.<p>IMHO, this is a very important point for social (and many other types) of startups.",1267266284

1155153,comment,1155108,1155108,0,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, it seems that fortunately the damage, while significant, isn't as catastrophic as one might expect from an earthquake of that magnitude (7th-largest on record, if the 8.8 is confirmed). I don't understand these things too well, but besides Chile's relatively good infrastructure quality, it looks like the depth of the event, and the kind of ground/soil in the region, had something to do with it.<p>For example, even though this was much stronger than the Haiti earthquake (8.8 v. 7.0), the Mercalli intensities are much lower:

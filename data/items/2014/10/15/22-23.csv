I blacked out, but the stuff people told me I was doing was pretty weird. The stuff I remember about the crazy ward I woke up in involves sobbing, screaming, and being absolutely certain that the doctors were getting ready to remove my organs and sell them on the black market. I tried to escape but I couldn&#x27;t figure out where the exit was. In the morning when I was finally sane again, I had huge cuts and bruises all over and bloody knuckles. I was told later I tried to punch a very pretty medic in the casino my friends were fireman-carrying me through, so I can&#x27;t imagine what I might have done to whomever brought me to the hospital.<p>To this day i&#x27;ve never felt anything as extremely horrifying, and I also now know what it feels like to resign yourself to death. Incidentally, for months afterward, heavy drinking resulted in word salad. Once I drank too much at a club and tried to walk out of south beach, because aliens had taken over the island. There might have been other substances involved but I don&#x27;t remember.<p>I&#x27;ve never done a study of my own experiments with pot, but generally speaking if I took it by itself, I was fine, with the usually documented side-effects. Other times i&#x27;ve tried marijuana (typically with alcohol) i&#x27;ve ended up like others have mentioned: misinterpreting behavior or intentions of others in potentially bad ways.

8462293,comment,8461667,8461667,0,0,ddingus,,,"I currently use Quora.  It&#x27;s closed nature has some disadvantages, though writers clearly can choose to publish openly.  Many of those can be mitigated.<p>Everything is logged.  Changes, edits, whatever are all presented to all users, who can see what happened and who did it over time.  I think that&#x27;s a nice feature.<p>One thing Quora has going for it is the Be Nice, Be Respectful Policy.<p>In terms of technical knowledge, the site varies.  In terms of advice, or something one might call wisdom, it ranges from good to really great.  There are some garbage answers mixed in there, but it&#x27;s not hard to see and have a dialog about the good stuff.<p>Notably, Quora is a place where people can share themselves and their experiences unabashedly.  Women have had some trouble there, as have some other regular targets of discrimination, stalking, etc...  Quora has dealt with those quickly and is very, very interested in people not having any worries about discussions related to minority, gay, women, trans, and other sensitive topics.<p>Some of those discussions, advice, information are very high quality, frank, real, and I&#x27;ve personally contributed to some of that dialog in ways that did some material good for people really struggling, or fearful, unaware of their options, or possible outcomes.<p>While not perfect, the actions so far have produced some notable results.  I am eager to see how Quora plays out, because having that kind of dialog and the tools given to users to manage conflicts and provide themselves and others &quot;outs&quot; to what would otherwise be messy, troll ridden discussion is something many people would value, and it&#x27;s something missing from an awful lot of discussion online.<p>Some of us do share technical information.  A lot of us share insight and experience or perspective that can be coupled with technical information.  This has value too, and it&#x27;s a little different from the more structured and highly technical Stack Exchange, and from the more noisy, often difficult to pick through general message board or forum dialog.  This niche is also something I&#x27;m watching with interest.<p>There are some nice things too.  One is non-English speakers coming to add questions or participate in answers or comments.  People can help by making edits, or in some cases, by translating for them.  I&#x27;ve done a few of those.  Quora has a few students learning English on the site, and they ask often intriguing, challenging and notable questions about the language and use.  Over time, that could be a great resource.<p>I think &quot;sharing knowledge&quot; is somewhat misunderstood.  In a general sense, who we are, what our experiences have been, etc... are knowledge as much as math, facts, technical data is.  The overall norms for discussion at Quora allow for very frank, real dialog.  This can be worth a lot.<p>Go and search on how to give an awesome BJ, for example.  A gay man answered that with such clarity and perfection, it&#x27;s kind of amazing really.  Or search on women in tech.  Ladies there are posting up a lot of real experiences and advice that might be hard to come by and interact around elsewhere.<p>I could give a lot of other examples.<p>So far, I like Quora.  I give it some time, and so far, I&#x27;ve gotten some good value in return.  Some time is going to be required to see the more subtle aspects of Quora play out and then we might better understand where the value is.",1413413357

That&#x27;s why malpractice is almost always a civil, not criminal matter.  The problem here is that with Ebola, the consequences of making what would often be a minor and correctable mistake are uniquely grave.<p>For that matter, an early Ebola diagnosis currently hinges on the patient&#x27;s self-reported travel and Ebola exposure history.  These screening criteria will <i>completely</i> miss 2nd stage (? what&#x27;s the term for this) infections when the patient doesn&#x27;t know he had been exposed to someone who&#x27;d been to West Africa, or some place else it will hit in due course.

It simply doesn&#x27;t mandate it.<p>If you wanted a 2nd channel confirmation like that, I suppose you could set up the service to link a mobile device (there might even eventually be some FIDO app that accepts FIDO challenge push notifications in a way that&#x27;s not service-specific).  Then FIDO would be used exclusively on the second channel (parenthentical stages 2, 3, 4 in your example).  The web interface in that kind of setup would have nothing to do with FIDO.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the MITM malware threat model you&#x27;re envisioning that can hijack an in-band public key crypto exchange, but that can&#x27;t simply hijack the session on the browser after you&#x27;ve completed (validly) the out of band verification.<p>Some of the complexity of FIDO is there to enable reasonably secure single-channel authentication (as might be expected, there are trade-offs between easy SSO and subdomain/origin policy security).  But I think FIDO would still be valuable if you wanted to do out of band confirmation without a browser.  The hardware dongles are standardized (although the requirements to unlock a key can vary from a button press like on the NEO to, hypothetically, biometrics in advanced dongles).  Mobile apps would also be standardized, much like TOTP is now, so you could use any FIDO app with any FIDO dongle (or no dongle, if an app offers less secure on-phone secret storage).  Without a hardware standard, you either <i>have to</i> store secrets on the mobile device, or you run into the existing problem of needing N hardware dongles for N services.",1413413266

Android seems to be doing it using OpenGL ES, but I&#x27;m not aware of any GNU/Linux window manager capable of this. The display controller didn&#x27;t support rotation and the only remaining alternative would have been too hacky for my taste, to use the image processing engine to maintain a rotated shadow copy.<p>* Limited capabilities: processing speed is mostly OK, but only 2 GB of RAM and the slow framebuffer are not great. There&#x27;s almost no I/O, essentially you only have a USB OTG port. Tablets are not thermally designed to sustain high loads. Battery life will probably not be that great and it seems difficult to upgrade the battery.<p>Now, some of this stuff doesn&#x27;t fully apply to Nexus 9. I expect Google to be better at providing a kernel source closer to that&#x27;s running on the device and the hardware itself it much more capable, it even has OpenGL (non-ES) support. This still leaves quite a few issues. Chromebooks (used for running GNU/Linux, of course) might be worth looking into.",1413412568

Instead, new web standards features/JS improvements/what-have-you are inexplicably tied to fluff features like 3d tabs. On the other hand, features that would make more sense to not mutate constantly on your user get changed way too frequently (for example Mail, which quite frankly doesn&#x27;t need constant updating, yet still broke Gmail for so many people on Mavericks release and should have really been caught beforehand).

I need to dive into this deeper, but I wrote a paper in 2008 (cited 110 times) called Survival of the Sparsest. I showed that when computational networks were permitted to evolve their connectivity (under a selective regime) they would evolve to a kind of minimum energy state with minimal network complexity (economic with no spurious connectivity). Looking at biological gene networks, I showed that this pattern of sparse connectivity showed up again and again.<p>For a given function, this suggests that there may only be one or two network topologies that satisfy the conditions of being both efficient and functional. This makes a good null hypothesis if you can see the input and output states and need to guess the structure of that network. If you don&#x27;t see that structure, then maybe this suggests that there is some other confounding variable lurking out there. For example, maybe the network has extra connectivity because redundancy is a functional requirement and not just nice to have.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;s some relationship here between root(2N) and the minimal complexity networks I was evolving.

You can even use boring old existing PKI.<p>You&#x27;re not sending authorization &quot;blind&quot;, though. You have to request the login from one device with a password, and approve it from another with a button push. In this way, only logins that <i>you</i> requested get sent to you, and only requests <i>you</i> approve get sent back, and <i>both devices</i> would have to be hacked by an attacker to intercept either part of the authentication process. Well, unless they both have your cracked password and inject malware on your mobile. Perhaps putting the button-pressy part on the hardware keyfob is safer :)<p>Even if none of this were cryptographically signed, look at the typical 2-factor SMS with this process. A user attempts a login and a text is sent to them with a code. The user then puts this code back into the login screen and presses return. If they could simply press a button on their phone they could approve the login without having to type the code in. Of course, we want to require a button press, because an automatic login means anyone who initiates the login (like an attacker with a stolen password) could log in automatically. And what i&#x27;m proposing is basically this, but with actual secure connections instead of SMSes or e-mails, and the ability to confirm on the device that the request was legit and not part of an elaborate phishing expedition.<p>All of this would work without a data connection because you could use QR codes to enter the challenge token into the device and it would spit out the response in a variety of formats.",1413411621

Unfortunately he basically hasn&#x27;t left my parents&#x27; house for the past 18 months or so (he had a psychotic episode that resulted in arrest/hospitalization and was forced to drop out of the Ivy League graduate program he had been in). We can&#x27;t get him on any kind of medication because his religious mania causes him to reject western psychiatry.<p>My parents also recently started attending a NAMI course and it seems to be helping. I recommend it to anyone going through a similarly painful situation. The hardest thing for me is the lack of insight in my brother (in the psychiatric sense of the term) - how to convince someone they&#x27;re insane? I have to assume that it&#x27;ll come from him rather than us if it does, but he seems to be losing grip on reality more and more with each year.

Someone I know has had that device on their desk for the past year. There is no part of it that is innovative. They do not deserve a patent. By applying for a patent, they destroy their credibility in the field. Which is all extremely sad and stupid because it's a cool product and they've thought of very creative stuff to make with it. They are wasting effort and money on patenting this stuff when they could just execute better than everyone else and have the market for what is clearly a fad to themselves. The more money they waste on crap like that, the less likely they are to deliver in time.<p>On that note, hell yeah I am completely against patents. Patents are the biggest threat to open hardware, and open hardware is my life.",1361339989

If someone had written something better and with similar exposure, people would give <i>that</i> assessment more authority.<p>Books and essays like ""Management secrets of Gengis Khan"" are an attempt at invoking this kind of power, that the writer is both knowledgeable enough and the topic is relevant enough to the times in which it appears to hold sway in some way (if only for book sales, natch). If nobody cares who the ""Gengis Khan"" author is and their way of describing what they're talking about reaches enough people to operate a (sub-) cultural transformation, then the words will therefore have little meaning in the practical sense.<p>To be sure, writers write from their own subjectivity. This cannot be avoided, so to critique something as having too much of the author in it is a little beyond the pale (pace Derrida). The last century-plus of philosophy and critical exercise have taught us that objectivity doesn't exist (irony intentional); there will always be hints of the writer's mind, biases, and so on. So of course the Jargon File is going to have ESR's fingerprints all over it.<p>We can talk about how the JF's corpus is weak and riddled with a particular subjectivity, but the simple facts are that it's accessible, easy to digest, and an early description of many, many concepts of the subcultures affiliated with computers. It acquires authority this way, regardless of followers-on and critiques. It's the same problem the Bible and other major religious texts have, but it's also germane to the scope of things like operational best practices, equity allocation, and any other topic where there are schools of thought. The critique raised here is simply another front in a battle between schools. Steven Levy articulated an infinitely more detailed description of hackers, but that has a concomitant inaccessiblity (length), but in my mind equally valid.

Yes, advertising is the majority revenue product, but like many startups, the people working on moonshots are not thinking about the business model, they are thinking about the problem to be solved. When most people go work on a 20% project, some of which become top Google services, they don't start out thinking, for example, ""How can I increase ad revenue by making voice recognition better.""",1361336478

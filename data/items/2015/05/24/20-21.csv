I think they were very timely (1998) because it was only 1991 legislation came in to affect that required adults to wear seat belts in the back of the car. Various seatbelt changes were finally implemented in the 80s and early 90s, but attitudes unfortunately had not shifted much (the people who I knew, anyway).<p>Also, my parents and grandparents grew up in different times in which seat belts were not required, or even present in the rear.<p>That video also highlights something I do too often: paying too much attention to what&#x27;s going on behind.

A program that typechecks cannot have type errors during runtime. Dynamic type (i.e. runtime tag) based functions like instanceof break this, and most (all?) OOP languages have it in some form.<p>2. Type inference: the types of expressions can be unified to the most general type that works for all of them. I don&#x27;t know any popular language that is able to do this.<p>Most typing I see added to languages these days are cherry-picking consequences of the HM algorithm. C++&#x27;s auto keyword for example is a very simple version of type inference, type hints in dynamic languages aren&#x27;t checked (or checkable) statically, and when runtime tags are involved it&#x27;s hard to speak of static type inference.",1432501039

I spend upwards of 10 hours a day in classes or in the lab. I&#x27;ve tried prepping meals beforehand to avoid eating out, but in the end I always ended up getting fast food on campus because I didn&#x27;t have time or energy. Powdered foods have a surprising amount of utility as a meal replacement for one or two meals a day.<p>Soylent itself is a fantastic product, truly. They&#x27;ve been attentive to the needs of their users, adapting the formula to issues as they crop up (such as digestive troubles from an excess of fiber), and recently made it a lot easier to use by incorporating the oils into the powder. Now they just send you the powder, and you mix it with water in the included pitcher. No measuring or anything. Of all the powdered foods, Soylent is easily the most convenient.<p>Nowadays, I&#x27;m a big fan of Schmilk. It tastes pretty good (like milk and oats) for powdered food, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive at $55/week (with no subscription) for the powder (and around $10/week for the whole milk required).",1432500830

What I am worried about, though, is the fine structure of &quot;custom&quot; proteins - meaning proteins that have been specifically generated by the brain to modulate the activity of one or more very specific neurons. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to suspect that these serve an important role in long term memory formation and function.<p>I strongly suspect digitizing the connectome by itself may not be enough in the same way that saving the structure of an artificial neural network <i>without</i> preserving info about any weights, activation functions, and other parameters is not enough to reproduce the network later.<p><i>> by copying the digital data to many archives and formats online and offline. No such option is available to a cryonics brain unless it abandons cryonics entirely</i><p>How you judge this depends on what you&#x27;re trying to achieve with cryonics. In theory, a destructive scan of a cryo-preserved brain should yield more and better data than that of a plastinated one. The question becomes: do we need that additional data or not?<p>I&#x27;d like cryonics to preserve brains until it becomes clear how to scan them adequately. By comparison, cryonic preservation is a relatively gentle process, whereas plastination imposes some heavy chemical changes on the brain to the point where it&#x27;s entirely likely that too much information could be lost. The promise of cryonics lies not in a biological resurrection at a later date, but in giving researchers enough time to figure out how to actually do an upload. It <i>may</i> well turn out that plastinated remains are a sufficient data source, but contrast that with cryonics where much fewer doubts about the preservation of the necessary information exist.<p>Of course, cryonics is beyond problematic - it requires constant and costly upkeep. And more importantly, just a few days of political, economical, or technological instability can easily wipe out every cryo-preserved brain in existence.

There is the risk added or reduced for your force in particular, but also the risk added or reduced for the adversary forces.<p>E.g. you put &quot;insurgent&quot; in scare-quotes when mentioning that they actually pose a danger to your family in the military, but without seeming to realize that many of the NSA programs Snowden leaked are directly aimed at those very same insurgents putting your family at risk. Even if we take it as true that the U.S. managed to unilaterally create insurgencies (which is by no means the case), that is not the fault of U.S. servicemembers like your family any more so than any other non-U.S. politician.<p>To loop back to my point about managing general risk, the things that Snowden leaks had disastrous real effects, including second- and third- order effects. Beyond improving the security posture of U.S. insurgent adversaries and terror networks (terror networks that strike against U.S. allies in addition to the U.S. itself, I might add), Snowden&#x27;s leaks also had the effect of weakening the national intelligence agencies of important U.S. allies, and reducing Western nations to infighting even as they needed to be able to present a united front due to geopolitical changes. It&#x27;s hard to make statements about past &quot;what-ifs&quot; (though that has never stopped Snowden&#x27;s supporters from chicken-littling about future what-ifs...), but certainly the joint U.S./E.U. reaction to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Crimea would be more meaningful without Snowden&#x27;s actions a year earlier.<p>But just because these risks (for the U.S. and for the possible adversaries or the U.S.) can&#x27;t be quantified or laid out in short and simple flowcharts doesn&#x27;t mean that those risks don&#x27;t exist.",1432498817

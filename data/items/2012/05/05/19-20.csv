Well, as part of the EU since 2007, the most talented Romanians now move to Germany and the UK for software work.<p>The same principles are at work in the American Union as that of the European Union. There are many intelligent English speaking people in Alabama who have been to excellent schools established during the space program, and many parts of areas have very low wages. However, we do not see much outsourcing to Alabama because the talented tech people (aside from Marshall Space Center) are not actually telecommuting in tech work from those remote areas, accepting those low wages. They instead move to California and New York when they graduate college. This happens because in both the EU and US there is freedom of movement between member states.<p>Both states are part of a union with freedom of movement between states. Both unions have poor areas. In neither case can you rely on finding high skill talent and expect to pay low wages as the article suggests, because the talent moves from the poor regions to the areas that pay market wages.",1336247542

After all, corporations are institutions that plan to require you to do things if they hire you, some of which you might not value.<p>A somewhat less meta answer is that employers trust standard curricula enough to not be interested in doing case-by-case evaluation of alternatives. So if one person has a ""4-year accredited electrical engineering degree"", and another person has passed a selection of EE courses they chose themselves, the company will probably prefer the 1st. Evaluating the 2nd candidate requires the company to decide whether that selection of courses constitutes a good EE curriculum (versus, for example, the student having avoided all the hard or math-heavy courses), and most companies don't know or want to know how to evaluate student-customized curricula on a case-by-case basis.",1336246969

Game over: you sell it, you're done. In some fields it's a little different; text book publishers expect to issue new editions, for example. But those new editions are <i>de facto</i> different books, re-written and re-edited and re-typeset from scratch.<p>Newspapers and magazines need CMSs because they may need to pull or revise stories. Novels ... not so much. Yes, it's good to fix typos. In the world of paper publishing the author gets just <i>one</i> shot at that: the book goes back to be re-flowed for a different page size when it goes from hardcover into A-format paperback, and there's an opportunity to fix snags.<p>This is, obviously, going to change. In fact, I expect the bigger publishers to wake up real soon now and realize that not only do they have to do e-pub related things like drop DRM and fix the broken territorial rights problem, they also need to do internal process-related things -- like set up a CMS, in-source their typesetting, and modify their workflow to allow updates to existing-and-out-there books, rather than viewing the books as a terminal state at the end of a production process.<p>(Reasons why it should change? Well, for one thing it makes possible the issue of ""director's cut"" versions of a book. Yes, crass commercialism. But it also makes it possible to retarget books on a different audience. It makes it possible to rebundle in-series books in an omnibus edition. It makes it easier for the publisher to directly issue extracts from the book via their website, for promo purposes. Once layout/typesetting stops being a single step and becomes an ongoing process, there's every reason for in-housing it. And that, in turn, will require revision control and archival functions that publishers are currently unfamiliar with.)",1336246862

By bundling education into its most popular format, the four-year degree, we are inevitably adding low-utility courses that the consumer should be enabled to avoid.</i><p>That's a problem with the curriculum, not the overall concept of a 4-year degree. There are schools that bundle useless courses as part of the required curriculum just because a tenured prof wants to teach it in a large auditorium. But other schools encourage students to build their own curricula with the courses that offer the most value to them. Brown University, for example, has been doing this for decades. It's not perfect, but it goes a long way toward catering to the needs and desires of each student.<p>I have two (soon to be three) degrees in some combination of humanities and social sciences, and I've thoroughly enjoyed all but one or two of the dozens of courses I've taken so far. I've been fortunate because all the schools I've attended have been quite flexible in their course-taking requirements. I wish most students at many other universities enjoyed the same amount of choices.<p>On the other hand, there is something to be said in favor of requiring engineering students, for example, to take a few courses in the humanities and social sciences. If you think you don't need to know philosophy or history to be a good engineer, you may find yourself at a disadvantage when dealing with today's complicated techno-socio-political issues. I would hate to live in a world where engineers did not stop to consider their work in a philosophical and historical context.<p>Sure, you could study history outside of a college. High school really should teach critical thinking skills. But the reality is that most people would never even get a chance to think critically about topics in the humanities and social sciences if they weren't required to do so by their college's curriculum.<p>The same goes for requiring humanities students to take introductory courses in math and science. Honestly, every college student should also be required to take a course in practical computer use unless they can demonstrate that they already know the stuff.<p>EDIT Clarification: There are plenty of other reasons to advocate a reconsideration of the value of higher education as a whole, but a poorly designed curriculum isn't the most important reason. That one can be fixed without ditching the college altogether.",1336246658

One important problem is the faculty, except that of CS, lack a vision and passion for research. While CS, Elec profs have undergrad experience at IITs, it is not at all true for other departments like Physics. [Yup, I am from EP]. The profs are ones who had a B.Sc at some regional university and MTech and Phd at IIT.  And I say CS students are not the ones who can contribute to the core Scientific Research. They drive Technological Innovations. But the research in CS is very 'volatile'. There is no sharing of Ideas in other departments as in CS. Ideas quickly spread in CS and give rise to better solutions to problems. But not so in medicine or physics. India already has a great 'research' contributions in CS. I myself has lost all the passion taking Physics as my professional career after coming here, and I am pursuing CS (which I was naturally able to connect, given it's mathematical nature, the first fav subj for any IITian).

But the course is really set by the hiring team.<p>There was a time when you only had to study legal books on your own and pass a bar exam to become an attorney. Law schools didn't exist until the turn of the century. Nowadays you can't seriously pursue a career in law without a law degree, and to get a top job, you have to have a degree from a top law school. This is not because the fundamentals being taught at each school are different. Rather law firms know which schools are hard to get into and simply go there to hire their talent because they figure those people are the best. Hopeful attorneys see those firms and want in, so naturally, they want to get into the top law schools. Those who don't, trickle down to the less prestigious schools where the firms that can't afford to compete with the top firms recruit, and so on. This is basically what drives the obsession with higher education in the U.S. whether it is business, law, medicine, or engineering.<p>Now whether a career in a prestigious firm is something you should actually want is a completely different conversation, but allowing that it is something a lot of the most eligible college graduates aspire to, the system will sustain itself.",1336246141

3932934,comment,3928079,3931309,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Haha I believe you. But you would really disobey some laws on principle? Which type? I can see people smoking pot and saying its on principle. But in a lot of cases it seems more like people don't break such laws on principle but simply because they want to do something that's illegal. For example take pot smoking and pirating media. I've done both k owing they were illegal. It was easy for me to break those laws because they seemed victimless and the likelihood of getting caught and the way I perceived the seriousness of the crimes to be minimal let me ignore the potential consequences. If I were to get caught I wouldn't protest to the police and judge and try to make a stand. I'd pretty much say ""fuck. I shouldn't have done that"" and try to get out of trouble. Now, I'm not saying this describes you but it seems like the whole ""on principle"" argument is an excuse for many. Most people don't smoke weed because they want to protest the law. They just want to get baked. Most people aren't pirating media because of their stance on copyright. They just want the new Justin Beiber single. There are laws that need to be broken in protest then there are first world laws that are conflated and compared to fights for freedom but are really just petty. Again, this is not directed at you specifically but I've heard this from others for whom it would apply - an individual breaking a law in protest does not help matters. Even if there massive amounts of people doing the same thing it still makes no impact. You have to unify, organize, and get active to truly change something that's wrong in the world. Getting a bunch of people together to smoke pot or pirate the new Dark Knight film in protest is nothing more than a self-important circle jerk where everyone pats each other on the back for protesting. Getting politically active, lobbying representatives (with or without money), getting out the vote, marching in the streets, educating the people who aren't aware of the issues are all far superior to creating a Twitter hash tag or getting together in an online forum. You need to get the attention of the uninformed, the opposition, and those with the power to execute any plans for change. Otherwise it just looks like a circle jerk. I would point to the protests against SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA as examples of the right way to protest. No one was breaking any laws. They just got the word out, made their case, and lobbied like hell to get those shut down. In addition the protests weren't exclusively online. Personally, I would've liked to see more rallies and physical protests but I wasn't involved so I can't say much. On the flip side, the ""right way"" can be equally ineffective. I'd point to the early days of the Occupy movement. There was a point in the Occupy protests where they just looked like a bunch of disorganized hippies out protesting that life isn't fair. They had a complaint but offered no clear solutions that they could rally behind and push for. They were out there basically screaming ""the economy sucks! Someone please fix it!"". These days it seems they have a more concrete plan and not just a list of complaints.<p>Sorry to rant. This wasn't directed towards you specifically. It's just that what you said reminded me of some people I know who like to ""protest"" but are all talk and full of BS.",1336245047

I still try to do as much as I can, hoping that my efforts will be enough.</i><p>I didn't get into the IITs after my 12th and thought myself not smart and hardworking enough to do well at an IIT, leave alone at research. Many years and plenty of twists and turns later, I'm now a graduate student at a well-regarded and extremely selective US university. I have a small number of papers, some of which even get cited every now and then (!) and a couple of patents. The main thing I learned from all this is that in research it's not very important to be smart, because I see people smarter than me all the time, what's important is to actually like what you're doing sufficiently that you <i>enjoy thinking really</i> hard about it.<p><i>lack of research output may be because the brightest of UG students get into US universities where there are better research groups and opportunities. Or may be because other engineering colleges from where the PG students have completed their Undergraduate programs didn't offer as much as IITs (or US universities do).</i><p>There's a combination of factors here. Many good students do choose to go the US/Europe over India and I can sort of see why they do that. Life, in general, sucks a little less here, the professors are little better, opportunities are a little easier to get, and of course, a good job after graduation is significantly easier. I studied at IISc and got to know quite a few faculty there and at a couple of IITs. I feel that the Indian system is improving rapidly and there are many good professors who are doing excellent research at IISc and the IITs. Having said that, I think that some things are still harder to do in India, and some professors are still very mediocre and some still harbour rather regresive views on how research should be done. A generation or two from now I expect things will be a lot better.<p><i>It is unfair to compare IITs with other institutes, there are a lot of factors at play. Sure, we want high paying jobs - but if they are available who won't? Think about the socio-economic pressure on the students as well. For a middle income family most salaries that are offered to IIT graduates will bring about a significant change in lives of these students as well as their families. It might be a different case in US (and other countries) but a lot of us face these issues. I was lucky that I don't, but I know many students with parents who will feel happier if their child settles down with a high paying job and not pursue higher education for another 2 - 5 years.</i><p>This is an excellent point.<p>We're still at that phase in our development where it's more important to ensure economic security for oneself so that one is guaranteed a reasonable standard of living. Foregoing these ""high-paying jobs"" and doing research, in effect, means accepting a significantly lower standard of living and it's completely unreasonable to expect people to do that in a still-developing country like India.",1336245039

Even on the communism times we learned English and other foreign languages (myself I learned since I was 8 years old).\n2. Strong theoretical learning in math and physics.\n3. Proximity to Europe (this article doesn't address just the US market but also Europe)\n4. Imagination and creativity of the people. We were used to not having things so we tried to be creative about them, make them somehow. I didn't have toys when I was a kid so I made my own toys (including functional model rockets and airplanes). We cam accomplish a lot with less resources and you don't have to micro-manage us (and I had bad experiences with micromanagement of some outsourced people from Asia - they couldn't do anything without me telling them in detail what to do).\n5. Being part of EU and NATO is no small advantage. That means the country is secure and changes of regimes (like we see in South America sometimes) are not possible anymore (not to mention wars - how's Argentina doing with Britain?)",1336244874

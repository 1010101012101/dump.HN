I don&#x27;t think scientists/doctors have it fully figured out just yet (given how little we understand the brain in general, no surprise).<p>Of particular interest are persons with very anomalous findings: fully functioning <i>with virtually no real &quot;brain&quot; to speak of</i>, just plenty of CSF sloshing around. When I first came across this, I was certain it was a hoax.<p><i>Later, a colleague at Sheffield University became aware of a young man with a larger than normal head.  He was referred to Lorber even though it had not caused him any difficulty.  Although the boy had an IQ of 126 and had a first class honours degree in mathematics, he had &quot;virtually no brain&quot;.  A noninvasive measurement of radio density known as CAT scan showed the boy&#x27;s skull was lined with a thin layer of brain cells to a millimeter in thickness.  The rest of his skull was filled with cerebrospinal fluid.  The young man continues a normal life with the exception of his knowledge that he has no brain.<p>Although anecdotal accounts may be found in medical literature, Lorber is the first to provide a systematic study of such cases.  He has documented over 600 scans of people with hydrocephalus and has broken them into four groups:<p><pre><code>   -those with nearly normal brains
   -those with 50-70% of the cranium filled with cerebrospinal fluid
   -those with 70-90% of the cranium filled with cerebrospinal fluid
   -and the most severe group with 95% of the cranial cavity filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
</code></pre>
Of the last group, which comprised less than 10% of the study, half were profoundly retarded.  The remaining half had IQs greater than 100.</i><p>More citations:<p><a href=""http://flatrock.org.nz/topics/science/is_the_brain_really_necessary.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flatrock.org.nz/topics/science/is_the_brain_really_ne...</a><p><a href=""http://www.rifters.com/real/articles/Science_No-Brain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rifters.com/real/articles/Science_No-Brain.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lorber"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lorber</a>",1380866268

&quot;
What Does Part 97 Say?<p>Section 97.113 (4) &#x27;messages in codes or ciphers intended to obscure the meaning thereof, except as otherwise provided herein&#x27; (emphasis added).<p>Based on the above quote, we can use any method at our disposal to provide for secure authentication which does not obscure the meaning of communications. As we start using more computing environments and bring the Internet to ham radio, we have to make sure that service is not provided to non-licensed users. In voice space, it is generally easy to spot a non-ham, but when everyone is using the same software there is not a similarly intuitive way to distinguish between the licensed user and the unlicensed user.

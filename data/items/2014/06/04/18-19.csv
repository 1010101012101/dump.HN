7847438,comment,7845361,7846566,3,0,petercooper,,,"xanderstrike did a really good job of explaining a part of it.  The monarch is our true head of state and the Royal Family our &#x27;family of state&#x27;, if you will. For all their problems, the Royal Family provides a real sense of continuity for Britishness and, to a lesser extent, an important sense of separateness from politics (usually) and what I consider critical &#x27;reserve powers&#x27; to protect us from potential extraordinary political events (it&#x27;s hard to speculate, but I doubt George V would have allowed a Hitler-esque figure to dismantle the political apparatus of the UK in the way Hitler did in Germany under von Hindenburg).<p>I must confess I recognize I am slightly biased as our current monarch is such a <i>good</i> one. I might not have been so keen on the institution in Richard III&#x27;s time ;-) Politicians come and go and prime minsters are lucky to stay around for 10 years, but Queen Elizabeth II has been the figurehead of my country for 62 years and has essentially devoted her life in service of it. I have a lot of respect for her as an individual.<p>There are a variety of lesser, miscellaneous reasons too. I see no specific need to change, the Royal Family provides a net profit to the country financially, having an army allied to the country rather than its current political system is best, they don&#x27;t have a significant impact on democratic procedure in ideal times, they provide a long-term narrative and stability, and more besides.",1401908392

Seems like the qualities of &quot;complaining, demanding attention, interrupting while working&quot; could easily apply to a small child regardless of gender. But no, we prefer to be particularly sensitive when he talks about his PERSONAL life, and describes his PERSONAL girlfriend and her qualities.

7847424,comment,7844882,7846968,1,0,vardump,,,"Whenever you do forget, it&#x27;s immediately obvious by looking at the function in question. Or by grepping things that &quot;open&quot; something to see if there&#x27;s corresponding defer nearby.<p>In practise, it&#x27;s not a big problem, because you learn fairly soon when doing something reversible that a defer is needed to reverse it when leaving scope/function. Like:<p><pre><code>  func DoSomethingInSomeDir() error\n  {\n    err := os.Chdir(&quot;somedir&quot;)\n    if err != nil { return err }\n    defer os.Chdir(&quot;..&quot;) // always done even if there&#x27;s panic\n    ... do the something that can fail\n    return nil\n  }\n</code></pre>\nGranted, using chdir in the first place is rather evil in anything but in a simple utility. And yes, chdir(&quot;..&quot;) doesn&#x27;t necessarily bring us back to the starting position. And it itself can have error, which should be handled in real code. But this is a quick example. :-)<p>But I didn&#x27;t need to write a ChdirToSomewhereAndBack wrapper class either. Control flow is completely obvious. All potential bugs are in plain sight, not hidden in some wrapper.<p>If you saw this code for the first time ever, you&#x27;d have absolutely no surprises or need to browse code in some class.<p>If you needed to do this chdir thing often, you could simply wrap it in a function:<p><pre><code>  func DoSomethingInANamedDir(dirName string, fn() error) error\n  {\n    err := os.Chdir(dirName)\n    if err != nil { return err }\n    defer os.Chdir(&quot;..&quot;) // always done even if there&#x27;s panic\n    return fn(); // do the something that can fail\n  }\n</code></pre>\nthen just:<p><pre><code>  DoSomethingingInANamedDir(&quot;something&quot;, \n    func() err { ... something that can fail ... })\n</code></pre>\nOf course, as someone who sees this for the first time needs to look inside DoSomethingingInANamedDir.

7847402,comment,7845361,7846117,1,0,scrumper,,,"And yet there is a growing chorus of voices in the USA complaining - with some justification - that the country is run by an elite for the exclusive benefit of that elite. The fairness aspects you talk about are, at this stage in the evolution of Western democracy, largely nominal.<p>The British monarch acts as a very gentle but constant steadying hand on the tiller of government. The queen meets in private with the prime minister weekly and holds regular meetings with a group of senior politicians (the Privy Council) as well as performing the functions described in the OP. These things help to inculcate British political life with a sense of permanence and continuity, and of duty and service to the country - the latter two being especially well exemplified by the monarchy. The day to day scrapping at PMQs doesn&#x27;t reflect this on the surface, but read any retired PM&#x27;s memoirs for some color on how important that aspect of her role really is. This would utterly disappear with an elected head of state, leaving British politics to collapse (some would add &#x27;further&#x27;) into the kind of rampant short-termism which afflicts most Western republics.<p>True, she&#x27;s not elected. True, perhaps, that her position isn&#x27;t &#x27;fair&#x27; in some arbitrarily egalitarian sense, but that cuts both ways: she can&#x27;t escape her position. The steady state which Britain has reached over the last thousand years of experimentation is proving remarkably resilient, given that supposed lack of fairness and accountability at the very top.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just that theoretical concerns of absolute fairness and accountability don&#x27;t really matter when you have a system which works well and allows its people full participatory rights in its government.",1401908059

It leaks your implementation, so if later you&#x27;re saving to memcache, you&#x27;ll throw some different error, which could break consumers that have written code to handle the FileNotFoundException<p>2. It lacks context: file not found: foo.yaml ... wtf is foo.yaml and why was this random function trying to open it?<p>3.  You can&#x27;t tell programmatically what failed.  Something threw a filenotfound... but you don&#x27;t know if it was opening the config file or some other function, so you can&#x27;t handle it properly.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that now anyone who calls your function needs to wrap it in a try/catch, or let an exception from 2 levels deep bubble up.

A competent chatbot judge could suggest a novel situation, say <i>a broken-winged black Pegasus appeared in Jane&#x27;s hometown when she was seven</i>, and ask pointed questions to find out if the interlocutor is a human or a bot.<p>The issue with almost all current approaches to AI is that it is either purely symbolic or sub-symbolic. The current symbolic approaches cannot completely capture preconceptual experience human use to make sense of the world. When we hear &quot;idyllic rural area&quot;, humans use our mental imagery and sensory experiences to help us understand the sentence much more deeply than the list of words suggests.<p>The subsymbolic approach could potentially solve this issue, but it raises the problem of integrating all those complex, interacting parts, vision, auditory, motor control, conceptual thoughts, etc. into a unifying whole.

The problem is systemic disparate impact throughout the entire criminal justice system.<p>Getting rid of drug crimes does nothing to solve that, because you see the same pattern in basically every type of crime. Legalizing drugs would reduce the number of crimes, but not the racial bias.<p>You could just as easily &quot;solve&quot; the problem of racial bias by getting rid of any class of crimes. Like, let&#x27;s legalize speeding because more blacks are pulled over for speeding than whites. Great. But the fundamental problem of inequality still remains in every other area of the criminal justice system.<p>Also, how do mandatory minimum sentences lead to more bias? Wouldn&#x27;t that lead to less bias, since it removes biaased human judgement from part of the process? Otherwise you&#x27;d probably see whites getting more lenient sentences than they already do.",1431183582

In my opinion, this system leaves millions without a say in the direction of the country proportional to the support their opinions have in the populace.<p>Not only do I find it unfair, I find it offensive and undemocratic, and as a result I don&#x27;t see a government elected under such a system as having any legitimacy.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing this out: It is not up to you to define what is fair. Nor is it up to a majority. It is up to everyone. When a system leaves a substantial number of people finding it unfair and feeling robbed of any opportunity to be represented, it is unfair, whether or not the majority thinks it&#x27;s the most awesome system ever.<p>If you care about fairness, you need to care about gaining consensus, not about whether or not you&#x27;re above or below 50%.<p>> Unfair? No - given that, at this election, voters did not give majority votes to a UKIP candidate except in that one instance.<p>First of all, it is not majority of a constituency but a <i>plurality</i>. This is a big deal. My seat was won with 43%: The majority of his constituents wanted to be represented by other people. We won&#x27;t ever know who would have been preferred by a majority of constituents under one of the many systems intended to actually get to a majority choice.<p>Secondly, that the results matches the rules does not mean they&#x27;re not unfair.<p>When peoples votes carry different value based on where they live, then that to me by definition is unfair.",1431183409

Indeed, many components (nspawn included) depend on systemd-as-PID1. As such it is monolithic.<p><i>...and I hardly consider sysvinit to be a great example of such a thing - a bunch of cobbled together shell scripts serialised into a particular order isn&#x27;t particularly clean or elegant.</i><p>You&#x27;re confusing sysvinit with sysv-rc.<p><i>You do realize that there are only a few binaries?</i><p>Have you actually compiled systemd? The binaries probably exceed a hundred at this point. The count given for 204 was 69.<p><i>The most controversial aspect of systemd, but of course as is overlooked all the log data can be forwarded to syslog, kmsg, the console or wall via a simple configuration change.</i><p>With two caveats: Forwarding to other sources has a priority loss and doesn&#x27;t have the same reliability/ordering/completeness guarantees (even if the claim is they &quot;try hard&quot;: <a href=""https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/syslog/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.freedesktop.org/www/Software/systemd/syslog/</a>), journald hijacks /dev/log and expects all syslogd implementations to conform to its own standard.<p><i>logind handles logins</i><p>Far more than that. It handles user sessions, seats, suspend/hibernate, some device enumeration, gettys and as of recent, system shutdown. It&#x27;s basically an extension from system init to session init.<p><i>it handles sockets for socket activation</i><p>Do you even understand what socket activation is? It&#x27;s a marketing buzzword for an old and simple concept, and the systemd definition in particular conflates multiple use cases. See this commentary by Laurent Bercot: <a href=""https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-994548-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html#7581522"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-994548-postdays-0-post...</a><p><i>It handles devices via udev, mount points (a key aspect to initialising systems), automount, swap, path-based activation and timers.</i><p>Mount points and swaps are just small unit wrappers around the mount and swapon/swapoff binaries. It&#x27;s oversold. Once again, path-based activation is a buzzword for reacting to file system changes, which you can do by leveraging inotify(7) or fanotify(7) independently.<p>There&#x27;s pretty powerful cron replacements these days that can take the place of timer units.<p><i>I can&#x27;t see how any of the above should NOT be part of an init system. Init systems should be capable of handling dynamic events.</i><p>Those features could be part of a process manager or a process supervisor, not init(8) itself. init(8)&#x27;s duties are reaping orphaned processes and handling high-level global system state at best (like SAK, shutdown, halt, etc.) It should not entangle the state of the system with the state of the OS processes, which systemd does quite egregiously. For example, even Apple had the engineering sense to separate their launchd plist configuration parser from the launchd PID1 itself.<p>How do you define a &quot;dynamic event&quot;?<p><i>Have a look at the dependency list here...</i><p>Your list is for systemd-204, which is <i>heavily</i> outdated. systemd moves really fast.<p><i>There&#x27;s a lot of bashing of systemd, but most of it (if not all of it!) is unwarranted and can be verified with even a modicum of research.</i><p>Too bad it&#x27;s apparent that you didn&#x27;t do much of it yourself.",1431182850

Modern GMOs, more than being about being resistant to specific herbicides, are about built in pest control. It&#x27;s part of the sales pitch to farmers: Buy this new seed, and you&#x27;ll spend less in pesticides. With a traditional seed, a farmer gets to either lose a lot of yield, or use pesticides. Organic farming doesn&#x27;t ban all pesticides: Some are considered natural, and are used a whole lot to protect the crop.<p>The problem is that organic pesticides are not necessarily less toxic for humans, or less likely to harm the environment. In fact, some organic pesticides are very toxic, even though they are &#x27;natural&#x27;. It get worse when we take into account that they have to be used in large quantities. Practical toxicity is affected by how much we use, and then ho much actually &#x27;leaks out&#x27; of the farm.<p>We also have the lower yields: A more &#x27;natural&#x27; seed tends to yield less in practice, so to get the same number of bushels, you need to plant more plants, and protect more plants.

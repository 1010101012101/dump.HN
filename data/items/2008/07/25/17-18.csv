The board works under Linux if the BIOS is modified to follow the ACPI spec, but under their own implementation it does not follow the spec. Thus at the minimum it is a faulty product that does not match the advertisement, and at worst it is an anti-trust violation. Certified or not, recommended or not, warranty or not, it does not fulfill the spec. The fact that Vista covers this up does not mean that it fits the spec when running Vista, no matter how you slice it, it is broken.",1217008542

Just stating the potential isn't interesting, informative or insightful any more than proclaiming that ""the internet is the future of business""<p>I guess I sounded a little erh, racist when I called them stingy: I guess I meant more along the lines of ""frugal"" and ""cunning"". Frugal: compare a Linen's n' Things to a chinese houseware store. You don't find NEAR as many useless kitchen knickknacks. Cunning: if i can duplicate your idea with a low-tech solution, I won't pay for your idea.(5-sizes melon baller set?!

While there is an inverse correlation between footspeed and intelligence in this extremely limited dataset, this evidence does not suggest there is a general inverse correlation because there are many many too many confounding variables. Look all you want, you won't find data that supports your conclusion.<p>There is a fundamental biological reason for this fact; no data suggests there are fundamental genetic differences between the races that result in the expression of differences in intelligence or footspeed or any other significantly complex trait.<p>This is because behaviorally modern humans evolved only 50,000 years ago. Modern humans were crafty and mobile enough to inhabit most corners of the world. We have not been isolated for sufficient period of time to establish the differences you are looking for.<p>We all are effectively the same version.

I think there's some kind of a distinction between a technology company, and technology company that is directly tied to a non-technology business, so that it also is a non-technology company.<p>Buildsoft (the acquired company) develop software for the building industry. At some point, this is the same business as developing physical tools for the building industry. Once there's a known task and a standardized way to solve it, we can develop our tool for doing that. There's less uncertainty.<p>I think the distinction is to do with uncertainty, generality and abstractness. A ""technology"" company is doing something new and unknown, that is <i>applicable</i> to many different industries - but hasn't settled down yet. Once the application becomes concrete, and specific to a particular industry, and the way of solving it is pretty well established, I guess it becomes just a regular business like any other.<p>Moore's ""Crossing the Chasm"" talks about customizing a product to a specific industry, as a way to get a measure of security - you won't get wiped out (until the next revolution in computers).<p>I was thinking that Warren might not have anything to do with this acquisition, but he's very attentive to capital redeployment, so I would guess he did personally approve this purchase.",1217007535

Companies still have the option of doing regular development and controlling their own marketing, distribution, revenues etc.<p>For your comparison to be valid, you'd have to consider the industries you're talking about. Microsoft operates within some pretty standard console industry practices - charging (relatively) small amounts for tools/licences etc. What they do is what Nintendo, Sony, etc all do and thus are neither bad nor good in this respect.<p>Now take a look at the smartphone market (major competitors being RIM and MS): APIs are pretty open, allow much more integration, users have much more freedom of choice, developers have freedom of distribution, speech etc.<p>Apple may be better than traditional cell phones, but they fail in comparison with their peers in this respect.<p>Just to give you an illustration, the last two projects I did had mobile components. I could not do an iPhone version of the first one for lack of background processes, and I can't do the second for lack of APIs that allow access to the phone's system settings. Meanwhile, a friend of mine is developing a horribly crippled medical device monitoring application, because the iphone allows bluetooth pairing for audio devices only.<p>None of these problems exist on the BB, Android and likely WinMo. So no, I am definitely not being hard on apple at all.",1217005453

The only answer is, you go out and continue to have big games. This would be akin to an interviewer asking Michael Jordan 'why did you miss 10,000 shots in your game' and he says 'I made XYZ game-winning shots and was NBA Finals MVP.'<p>If you look at any of the interviews about teammates/opponents of MJ, they all say he was very, very cocky.<p>Cocky != Refusal to fix mistakes.<p>Or perhaps, in a better context, an interviewer asking you why some of your stock purchases did not work out favorably, and you stating that you've had a lot of successes <i>despite</i> your failures.<p>I'm by no means a Michigan fan, but I saw him play a few games last year (on TV) and he was clearly a very, very good football player. Looking at Manningham's stats on Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Manningham"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Manningham</a> he seemed to have a pretty good season last year, when I believe the interview took place.",1217005260

But that's because email is BlackBerry's <i>core business</i>.<p><i>- What will happen if Microsoft demands 30% of all developer revenues for their products and limits the distribution of applications?</i><p>What, you mean like they do for XBox?<p>From the Wikipedia on ""Xbox Development Kit"": ""Only developers that are licensed by Microsoft may compile code and release binaries (.XBEs)of their software with the XDK, any software released using the XDK by developers that aren't licensed is illegal.""<p>I think the answer in the XBox case is ""Customers buy a lot of software anyway.""<p>These complaints about Apple are legit (their crazy SDK NDA is really frustrating), but they're still early-adopter nitpicking. The iPhone SDK is not the core of Apple's business: They made plenty of iPhone profits even when they didn't have one, and they had plenty of happy customers. Apple's currently-FUBARed email services aren't the reason that I bought a pair of Macs: I bought the Macs because they run Unix tools just fine, they've got modern browsers, they've got iTunes, the printers just work, there's a lot of available audio and video software that just works, they can run Photoshop, they can run Windows and Linux via VMWare or Parallels, they're kind of pretty to look at, they've got an amusing online fanbase, etc, etc.<p>All of that still works. None of it goes away just because some software that was released last week doesn't work yet. If you don't want to be burned like an early adopter <i>don't be an early adopter</i>.<p>One difference between Apple and Microsoft is that, when Microsoft released their new operating system, it reportedly performed poorly when running <i>everyday apps</i> on existing hardware with <i>formerly-supported</i> peripherals. The result is that... many people remained Microsoft customers but just went back to XP. They refused to be early adopters. Problem solved. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the other difference between them and Apple is that Microsoft's product development cycle is now eight years long, so late adopters will wait a <i>very long</i> time before upgrading...",1217005243

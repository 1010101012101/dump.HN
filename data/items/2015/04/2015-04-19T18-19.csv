The worst are offices without breakaway spaces, which cause impromptu meetings to happen at desks, which can be immensely distracting.<p>On the other hand, I have found that open plan offices can be a boon when working in small teams. One arrangement I remember quite fondly had groups of 4 desks in an X configuration with L shaped desks. We were working 4 to a team and it was a friendly and cooperative environment. The L shaped desks were also significantly roomier than I&#x27;ve encountered elsewhere.<p>I should note that my experience is in London, where I suspect there&#x27;s a greater premium on floorspace than in many other places.",1429469897

9404313,comment,9403483,9403890,0,0,bitexploder,,,"I definitely had problems with ADHD, and still do to some extent. I was listening to a book, The Sports Gene, and the touched on exercise and attention deficit. A proposed theory is that in the attention deficit brain you don&#x27;t have enough dopamine. Exercise produces the dopamine you need to get to &quot;normal&quot;. Therefore, exercise for some people is very rewarding and helps them out a lot. In other individuals who already have normal levels of dopamine it is a very &quot;meh&quot; experience for them, maybe even counter productive. They don&#x27;t get the boost of dopamine as strongly since they already had &quot;enough&quot; to function well. And, since they had to endure, potentially higher, cognitive load to do the exercise its a net negative for them. Anyway, I don&#x27;t know if this mechanism explains all of it, but anecdotally this matches extremely well with my experience.<p>Later in life I have come to rely on routine physical exercise as it keeps me on an even keel and productive. Caffeine and Ritalin both just made me go into the zone just the same way hard exercise does. I find that if I do not exercise hard and regular I have a hard time staying productive and I might seek towards other dopamine producing behaviors (Alcohol, junk foods). I have found a middle ground of moderate exercise, but it is never as fulfilling as being full tilt into a training cycle.<p>edit: Found a quote from the author of The Sports Gene:<p>&quot;Here at Axon Sports, we talk a lot about the brain’s role in playing sports.  From vision to perception to decision making to emotions, the brain plays a critical role in sports success.  What have we learned about neurogenetics that can influence an athlete’s performance from a cognitive perspective?<p>DE: One of the most surprising things I learned in my reporting was that scientists know quite well that not only does the dopamine system in the brain—which is involved in the sense of pleasure and reward—respond to physical activity, but it can also drive physical activity.<p>One of the scientists I quote in the book suggests that this may be why very active children who take Ritalin, which alters dopamine levels, suddenly have less drive to move around. That’s precisely what he sees when he gives Ritalin to the rodents he breeds for high voluntary running, anyway. And it appears that different versions of genes involved in the dopamine system influence the drive to be active. (Interestingly, native populations that are nomadic and that migrate long distances tend to have a higher prevalence of a particular dopamine receptor gene; the same one that predisposes people to ADHD. I discuss in the book the possible link.) &quot;",1429469854

9404303,comment,9403893,9403893,0,0,tedsanders,,,"I once worked at a utility studying this very issue.<p>The typical worries about solar are:<p>+Power intermittency (rapid, uncontrolled changes in power can push the voltage and frequency outside acceptable levels. This reduces reliability and can destroy electronics.)<p>+Voltage regulation (also, on a local level, PV can mess with voltage compensators, pushing voltage outside of acceptable levels at the end of voltage regulation zones)<p>+Morning power surplus (lots of solar power will drop the baseline demand from ~4AM to noon, reducing the amount of cheap baseline power you can run)<p>+Harmonics (crummy inverters can inject unwanted sine wave harmonics into the grid, again bad for electronics)<p>+Fault current danger (if a tree takes down a power line, both sides can be remain live if power is being pushed onto the grid by PV on both sides)<p>+Inverter tripping (the main way to fix the fault current problem is to mandate that inverters passively follow the grid&#x27;s voltage/frequency and then disconnect if they detect problems. However, with high PV penetration this has its own problem: a transient fluctuation can cause a domino chain reaction where all the inverters turn off, taking the grid down with them.)<p>+Power factor/vars (one important function for the grid is to keep current and voltage in phase, but today&#x27;s PV inverters are dumb and blindly produce power with a power factor of 1, which can mess with automatic capacitor banks meant to help counteract the inductive load of the grid)<p>Now, some of these problems are more real than others, and many don&#x27;t become an issue until PV penetration reaches like 30%.<p>The good news is that these are all solvable problems. Energy storage or additional natural gas peakers can fix the intermittency problem, and for the other problems the grid can be redesigned to allow better two-way power flow and inverters can be designed to produce higher quality power.<p>However, the bad news is that all of these fixes are expensive and all of them take years. Furthermore, many utilities do not have the expertise or confidence to make big changes to their grid and still guarantee reliable high quality power. Utilities are known for being slow and risk-averse, but they are risk-averse for a reason - blackouts are very costly to society.<p>Another issue for the utility is how to charge for power. Historically, utilities have tried to keep things simple for residential customers by charging only for power consumed. However, if residential PV becomes popular, utilities will have no choice but to change their pricing model so that they can be compensated for the non-kWh value they provide (e.g., reliability, stability, option value, power quality regulation).<p>The bottom line is that the problems from high PV penetration are real. Utilities are cautious, not evil, and they have good reasons to be. (Also, I think it&#x27;s ridiculous when people claim that PV will kill utilities - barring a radical shift in technology/economics, wires and pooled power regulation and economies of scale make a grid hugely valuable, even if power generation becomes more distributed.)<p>That said, these are all solvable problems and I am hopeful and optimistic about the long-term future of solar power.",1429469670

My dentist decided to quit and become a musician. A friend took a job with a pay cut because his wife moved for her job - it&#x27;s easier for a system admin to find a new position than a philosophy professor.<p>In any case, you don&#x27;t like employers who eliminate based on a single point of information, so you must not like an employer who eliminates candidates only because their current salary is well over the available funding. That doesn&#x27;t sound like you like their use of that information.<p>And that signal level is going to be lousy. The primary signal is the job roles/work experience. I can&#x27;t see salary adding much useful information. In some areas, like government, salary is closely tied to one&#x27;s job position, with only some variability based on skill level. There&#x27;s almost no information there in the first place, much less something that&#x27;s easy to disentangle.<p>It would also say that Lilly Ledbetter wasn&#x27;t as successful at her job as her male counterparts, because she was paid less, even though the reason she was paid less was due to 1) discrimination on the basis of sex, and 2) a policy of not revealing salary information.<p>If someone wins the startup lottery then spends the next few years working part-time to spend the rest of the time working on Linux kernel development, then said employer will regard the person as being unsuccessful, because options aren&#x27;t part of the salary information.<p>At another friend&#x27;s startup, the employees took a pay cut for a year, to help with cashflow problems while they did a pivot. That didn&#x27;t work, so they looked for new jobs. Again, your supposed signal would indicate that those employees must each be individually unsuccessful.<p>Sure, asking a job candidate about marital status, or children, or where the candidate goes to church is not &quot;unethical in and of itself.&quot; But these are not standalone questions completely uncoupled from the interview process, so your idea of splitting is apart is somewhat ridiculous.<p>Again, I say that all salary and income information should be public. Then all sides will have an idea of what the market is like. The salaries for government employees in the US are public, as are all the salaries in some countries, so it&#x27;s not like keeping this information secret is essential for the organization&#x27;s well-being.",1429469268

I think that a much more efficient way, and I believe, more durable also, would be rock-climbing because in addition to the physical expense (i.e. energy output), it also stimulates very powerfully concentration/focus and the zones of the brain associated with it (i.e somewhere in the pre-frontal cortex) and can actually teach concentration and focus.

These governors bid in advance to set their proportional gain for frequency stability.  Basically, they promise to autonomously raise or lower their throttle in the future based on the observed grid frequency and voltage, and get paid later when they make good on their promise.  Long-term stability (periods of 15 min or so) are regulated with market action in the spot market for power.  Very long term stability is regulated by markets that clear 24 hours in advance of their estimated delivery.<p>However, some energy producers effectively have flat rate contracts that don&#x27;t participate directly in grid stability.  Wind and nuclear will negotiate a fixed power-purchase agreement (typical prices are about 50 USD/MW-hr or so in the US) that will be fixed for years at a time.  Likewise, residential solar customers sell back their power under the same, basically fixed rate schedule that they use to buy power.<p>So, as the penetration of fixed-rate power increases into the market, the pricing volatility continues to increase as well.  There are technologies that can help.  In fact, it is trivially easy to get a grid-tied inverter to be sensitive to grid changes with controls that model virtual inertia, impedance, throttle, and so on.  This is part of what I do as a controls engineer.  The difficulty isn&#x27;t in implementing such controls, it is in adjusting the markets such that all of the existing players are comfortable with the result.<p>Witness this in Hawaii - the retail price of power is so high that it makes obvious good sense to install your own generation.

But those who follow fashions in tech tend to underestimate the opportunity costs of doing so.<p>This is the moral of the above story, and it is a good one:<p>&quot;Hopefully you are horrified by all things we didn&#x27;t do that are now considered best practices. No reproducible builds, lack of automated testing, creating and then repeatedly sidestepping technical debt. For a long time, that is how I told these stories: as horror stories that came complete with hand gesticulations to emphasize the &quot;can you believe I had to do that?&quot; nature of it all. Here&#x27;s the thing though: we were making money. We were growing and supporting ourselves.&quot;<p>I spent this winter working for a startup that had the opposite problem of most startups. The CTO was a serious Pythonista, and he wanted to ensure that all the code was written was of high quality. He wanted to avoid the build up of technical debt. There were 9 programmers on the team, using Python on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend. And he felt they could invent a new way forward, in terms of combining Python and Angular. And so the team was reinventing the whole Python stack: they had their own serialization libraries, their own database libraries, their own web server, their own authentication system. Adding each new feature lead to very long meetings in which people were encouraged to be thoughtful -- everyone was suppose to think about the long term consequences of whatever design was chosen. In some ways, it was a careful style, but it had a cost: the 9 developers spent more than 50% of their time on infrastructure questions that had already been solved elsewhere. In terms of meeting the real needs of this small startup, the startup might has well have had a team of 4 developers -- the money paid to 5 of the developers was, in a sense, an act of charity being offered to the Python community.<p>We&#x27;ve all ready endless stories about startups that cut corners, ran up technical debt, and eventually succeeded. We read much less often about startups that doing everything perfectly and then become successful. And that suggests that, for startups, cutting corners is the more adaptive path.",1429468143

The books&#x27; theory is exactly inline with my statement.<p>&quot;The first step towards civilization is the move from nomadic hunter-gatherer to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: 1) access to high protein vegetation that endures storage; 2) a climate dry enough to allow storage; 3) access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to food surpluses. Surplus frees people up to specialize in activities other than sustenance and supports population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technologic innovations which build on each other.

These power companies dont want to become energy storage companies, its too expensive. They prefer to simply make as much electricity at the moment as is needed.<p>I agree with the electric companies on this point. If they dont need the electricity, why should they be forced to buy it? That will increase costs for non-solar customers as they end up footing the bill for the battery storage needed by solar customers.

Yes, its nice to sell back electricity to the grid, but that feels like a very hackish way to use &#x27;solar&#x27;. It makes sense also.

However, in my experience as a professional statistician that has used Random Forests, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc --- finding the right algorithm takes &#x27;feature engineering&#x27; (<a href=""http://blog.kaggle.com/2014/08/01/learning-from-the-best/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kaggle.com/2014/08/01/learning-from-the-best/</a>) and close inspection of the data and basis function. Are the data fit well by rectangles? Then you&#x27;ll want to use decision trees / random forests. Curvy? Give SVM a try. Do the data take intricate patterns? Look into boosting (fitting on residuals recursively). Feature engineering boils down to the old statistical phrase, &#x27;live with the data.&#x27; That is, you actually need use your own mind and beliefs to organize inputs prior to feeding them into an algorithm. So in my experience, what seems to be true in Kaggle competitions, and the perspective of this author, it&#x27;s true --- algorithms are either tightly constrained and perform really well at a specific task, or they perform poorly (but quickly) in a broad sense.",1429467954

One second? I am just guessing here. It will take less than a millisecond on a usual SQL database.<p>Now increase the size of the database to say 100,000 facts. This will make essentially no difference for a normal database because they will likely be able to answer the query using an index in time logarithmic in the number of facts but it will take NebulaDB ten times longer to answer a query because GCC has to compile a ten times larger file.<p>If there is some quadratic code somewhere in the system it may actually take a hundred times longer. Every query requires processing all the data while a usual database will only touch the data relevant to answer the query.<p>Another thing are updates and deletions. I did not read the code in enough detail but can you support that? If yes it sounds a bit like a nightmare to me to find and remove or update the relevant lines in the C source code file. And it will be very likely a slow process because if the length of a fact changes you will have to move all the later facts.",1429467011

As for procedural and contractual issues, advocates in the past have gone so far as to get the owners of the assets to agree to license to Netflix free of charge, to no avail.<p>It&#x27;s sad that in the UK, VOD services are even further behind on accessibility. I do hope that Netflix is actively seeking out AD, but given their track record so far, I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.<p>Most of all though, I wanted to respond to one particular thing you said: &quot;And for all the stick they get, Netflix actually leads the way in accessible content&quot;<p>The lesson I&#x27;ve taken from this is that they don&#x27;t get nearly enough, or perhaps the right kind of, stick.

I&#x27;ve both personally visited homeless shelters where ex-homeless people lived and worked under guidance and coaching, and the general story from them was &#x27;don&#x27;t give money&#x27;. Maybe of them used drugs in the past and said the cliche is completely true.<p>In that case, if someone asks, best politely say no, direct them to places where they can get help (most advanced economies have some capacity in every city), and take the money and donate it to said places or another cause when you get home, pool it in a jar for a once a month or whatever donation if you want.<p>On the other hand, someone close to me in my own family was homeless for quite some time after a wrongful prison conviction. Despite him having enjoyed a great life, big social circle, never addicted, enjoyed higher education and a nice career etc, typical upper-middle class stuff, he struggled on the streets. His prison time carried stigma that he didn&#x27;t deserve, but couldn&#x27;t be proven innocent. He stayed on the streets partly because he was afraid to ask for help, to be seen. And partly because he was convicted on a holiday, outside of the country he knew well with a limited network.<p>Someone else in my family took him in, from the streets, gave him some money, a roof to stay under etc. And that&#x27;s why this person is part of my family now. And I&#x27;ve spoken to numerous ex-homeless who had no addiction, and just didn&#x27;t have any food or a roof to stay under. Or recently when we partially funded the first month rent for an illegal immigrant. He now has a painting job etc. It&#x27;s an uncertain existence for him, but he&#x27;s got an alright life and contributes his share to society and is financially independent. The issue is that cases like this require time to evaluate that you tend not to have passing someone by.<p>In short, I&#x27;m similarly conflicted and usually do give. When I have time I tend to have a chat and ask what they need. They&#x27;ll say &#x27;some change&#x27; or whatever and I&#x27;ll just cheerfully say huh, why? And they&#x27;ll say for some food or w/e, and I&#x27;ll just hang out with them for 20min and buy them some food and eat with them.

9151009,comment,9148746,9149640,0,0,eropple,,,"Personally speaking, I preferred ME2 greatly because it was a modern game in the good senses of the word: competent mechanics, enjoyable combat, and a good-enough story that was presented well enough as to be able to effectively stir emotional reactions that I appreciated. ME3 continued this trend--its general rep as &quot;ME2 but more and better&quot; is a compliment to ME2, which I feel like is a game that could have come out today and nobody would have felt it was out of place. In terms of mechanics and structure, it was ahead of its time, and it&#x27;s still very fun for me to play today.<p>On the other hand, the original <i>Mass Effect</i> is unplayable to me; that the narrative is a little (not a lot, IMO, despite retroactive claims to the contrary) tighter gets lost when the game is <i>too frustrating to play</i>, with unsatisfying core gameplay when you get out of menu hell to even play it. I liked many of the ideas in it--the Mako was a great idea with a ton of potential--but execution, and arguably the technology stack they used, was severely lacking. As such, ME1 is a product of that weird transitional era in games where few people seemed to really have a handle on what they were doing--a game like the original <i>Half-Life</i> has aged better than the ME1, and it came out many years before.<p>Now, isn&#x27;t it funny that that bears no resemblance to hurf blurf fancy graphics recognizable face hurf blurf?

People like these are all around us, that&#x27;s the really scary part for me. Some are quite obvious, some nto so much.

A bit much to just copy & paste in here, probably.<p>While so many people are complaining about what it doesn&#x27;t have, there are things it <i>does</i> have that, while not individually unique, are actually packaged into a unique bundle. Particularly the fact that it is a traditional imperative language. If you (like me!) don&#x27;t mind picking up Haskell or O&#x27;Caml or Erlang to get weird features, it might be hard to understand the appeal, but for many people Go is the first time they&#x27;ve seen these features without having to drop almost everything they know about programming on the floor in the process. This probably explains some of the breathless excitement it sometimes engenders... it&#x27;s the same breathless excitement that people will sometimes have when first using those other languages.<p>(And, yeah, the traditional imperativeness does bite a bit. I&#x27;d love to be able to assert that a goroutine is fully isolated from everybody else&#x27;s memory. In practice, I&#x27;m not having any trouble with that, but, then, I&#x27;ve got 7 years or so of Erlang under my belt so designing isolated processes that work together via clean interfaces is something I&#x27;ve got a ton of experience with from the most rigid language on this topic there is.

Let me tell you a story that happened to me.<p>I once went to a Java developers meetup. I&#x27;m a Lisper, probably the only one that was attending, so I was a clear minority (that was 3 years ago, back before everyone jumped onto functional programming bandwagon and started replacing &#x27;A&#x27;s in their company logos with lambdas, etc.). I actually only went there because my friend was giving a talk about Git. That, and they had free pizza. But I digress.<p>Anyway, there was this guy showing an interesting library for Java, name of which I can&#x27;t remember now, that was aimed at seriously reducing the amount of cruft and boilerplate one has to write, replacing common patterns with annotations. I thought it was a great idea, and wanted to congratulate him, but suddenly, the entire audience started criticizing. That it&#x27;s wrong, it&#x27;s not &quot;the Java way&quot;, etc. I voiced my opinion, that it clearly improves readability, for which I heard that I &quot;don&#x27;t get the Java way of doing things&quot;. I think I might also heard someone telling me, &quot;you&#x27;re a Lisper, this is different, you won&#x27;t understand&quot;.<p>Now should I be offended at that reaction? Well, I felt bad, but should I cry foul, and vent out on the obvious discrimination of concise languages? Should I Tweet about how misolambdic the people on that conference were? How they hate metaprogramming? Should I get someone fired from their job because they told me I&#x27;m a Lisper, and thus don&#x27;t understand Java? I&#x27;m a minority after all. I can&#x27;t even get a job in the field I love, and have to code PHP to earn my bread.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would find affirmative answers to above questions reasonable. And yet in some cases, it&#x27;s apparently fine to overhear a random joke and turn it into a mess that gets two people fired from their jobs, just because you&#x27;re a part of a minority. Do we want a society that&#x27;s <i>afraid</i> of minorities?

DPR did everything he could to conceal his identity while running SR and he still screwed up.

Adria&#x27;s case is more complicated. With regard to Hank, I know this is going to be unpopular but if the threats of physical violence (and, even, the actual fact) were directed at those who turned their backs on Hank, I&#x27;d support it, because morality demands enforcement sometimes, and abandoning someone in his time of need is unacceptable.<p>Adria fucked up, but she was the wrong target. She did something bad, and stupid, and wrong, in hot blood. The people who decided to abandon Hank in cold blood are the ones who deserve to be brutalized and terrorized into future decency (or oblivion).<p>Adria&#x27;s case is more complicated because firing her was the right decision (she was in a PR role, and a fuckup that ruins another person&#x27;s reputation is unacceptable when PR is your job) but I bet it was a sleazy tech-company firing where there&#x27;s no severance or contractual positive reference, and where the person is often singled out and humiliated. They also picked the wrong time to do it. They should have eased her out with a 6-month &quot;you don&#x27;t work here, but we&#x27;ll support you in landing on your feet&quot; period, and unless there&#x27;s something unusual that I don&#x27;t know about, they didn&#x27;t. So they&#x27;re almost certainly dirty as hell and I almost hope she reads this, gets treatment for her issues (described below) and also sues the hell out of them, not for firing her (they had to remove her from a PR role) but for firing her, a person with disability (I&#x27;ll get to that) in a damaging way at a damaging time.<p><i>Her lack of empathy is absolutely staggering. And, &quot;if I had kids, I wouldn&#x27;t tell jokes&quot;? Seriously?</i><p>I&#x27;m going to say this non-judgmentally. I have cyclothymia (mild bipolar) and panic disorder and... I know it when I see it. She&#x27;s mentally ill, and the most dangerous kind of it, because she doesn&#x27;t <i>know</i> that she&#x27;s ill. Instead, she justifies her horrible, mistaken actions by pretending she&#x27;s some kind of SJW rather than someone who panicked in a crowd and fucked up.<p>I didn&#x27;t join the Adria-hate bandwagon, originally, because I saw her as someone who fucked up rather than someone to hate. And I found the hatred rising as I read this interview. Then I got to the part about the abuse, and stopped hating her, because it made sense: she has PTSD, doesn&#x27;t know that she&#x27;s ill, and has a lack of empathy because severe mental illness makes you selfish, not out of a character flaw, but by necessity. So, I found myself not hating her at the end (although she should still get the courage to apologize for fucking up).<p>She, almost certainly, has PTSD because she was abused. That&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of. That&#x27;s how <i>normal</i> people react to awful experiences. She had what sounds like a (mild-to-moderate, because she was still able to type) panic attack. For evidence, this quote:<p><i>“Have you ever had an altercation at school and you could feel the hairs rise up on your back?” she asked me.</i><p><i>“You felt fear?” I asked.</i><p><i>“Danger,” she said. “Clearly my body was telling me, ‘You are unsafe.’”</i><p>(Trigger warning: this paragraph.) She was in a crowd. The people around her were annoying her. (When you have an anxiety disorder, lots of small things annoy you.) At some point, her nerves blew out. Again, nothing to be ashamed of. It happens. I&#x27;ve had hundreds of the fucking things. And panic can make you an asshole, like when you&#x27;re in line for water (to stop the dry-throat-feels-like-it&#x27;s-closing-up feeling) and you&#x27;re screaming at the people in front to &quot;stop taking so fucking long&quot;. (I screamed at someone, mid-panic, for using what I thought was a credit card for a $3 purchase and &quot;holding up the line&quot;. EBT, or &quot;food stamps&quot;. Huge dick move on my part; thought she was a yuppie who couldn&#x27;t be bothered to carry cash, I was wrong. Had to apologize profusely after that one.) So I am generally sympathetic to people who fuck up because of mental illness, even though posting a Tweet about the guys behind me wouldn&#x27;t be <i>my</i> strategy for dealing with a panic attack. I fail to see how it would resolve the episode.<p>What galls me about her is that she refuses to admit that she fucked up. I&#x27;ve seen enough not to demand <i>empathy</i> from the severely ill, but <i>human decency</i> is non-negotiable, and her self-righteousness is off-the-charts. Then she has to fall back on &quot;he&#x27;s a white male. I&#x27;m a black Jewish female.&quot; No, Adria, it&#x27;s not about that; he was never a danger to you, and you are someone with an intensely painful, but fortunately treatable, medical condition. You freaked out and ruined someone&#x27;s life in addition to your own, and that makes you hazardous. I have a lot of sympathy for people who suffer from mental illness, but not if they refuse to recognize and take responsibility for the problem.",1425566873

Those happen every five minutes at tech conferences. It makes more sense if she was suddenly lashing out at perceived sexism in the entire tech community, with the picture of the little girl on the screen combined with vaguely sexual humor acting as a trigger.<p>But. If she was so tightly wound that a dongle joke caused a sense of danger so profound that the hair on the back of her neck stood on end, then she&#x27;s probably dealing with personal psychological issues. We shouldn&#x27;t confuse the mental state of one person with the situation of all women in technology. I don&#x27;t think anyone is happy with the current levels of gender imbalance and sexism, but that seems like it might be a separate issue.<p>There&#x27;s a such a thing as too much empathy. If someone is exhibiting abnormal behavior then the best thing to do is to focus on getting them the help they need, and then question what factors in society might be contributing to their mental state. The majority of women can sit in a room full of men and overhear a dumb joke without feeling the need to publicly shame people. I definitely understand where you&#x27;re coming from, but this seems to be an issue about this particular woman and her psychological state.

Todays problem is that we want to make more money, faster (which is not &quot;wrong&quot; intrinsically as some people might think, but it does not work with the &quot;traditional&quot; stock model). The reason it does not work is that it may take some time for a company to be profitable and even then they may want to keep some of their profits to invest in research etc. which keeps dividends small (sometimes even 0). The new way one tries to make money is to buy a stock while hoping to be able to sell it to someone else for more money in the future (nothing wrong about that either). The real problem is that this price is based on supply and demand/perceived value which might differ significantly from the actual value (worth of the company&#x27;s physical assets, paid dividends, ...) -  it is easier to see these differences on more tangible things like luxury watches, art, etc., which are nowhere priced for their physical value (a frame and some paint - does not seem to be worth much ...) but they are there for stocks, too.<p>Now to the &quot;hyper efficient&quot;-part: yes, that&#x27;s true, the market is hyper efficient, as in it is not that easy to get money out, because that would mean that someone else leaves it on the table, but everything still happens in the &quot;perceived value&quot; point of view, in which you would have to compete, too, to make money with stocks.<p>The dilemma in which CEOs find themselves is that not all actions that are good for the company itself are good for the perceived value/stock price, at least not when you are forced to do &quot;short-term thinking&quot; (the CEO keeping his job, the trader making money now).",1425566681

This approach is incompatible with long-term growth, as there are only so many people who will fall victim to the idea of buying a worse game than last year&#x27;s edition yet still buy more and more expansions. EA pushes for day one profits seemingly without concern as to profits over the lifetime of the product. As soon as the product is unprofitable, they shut it down.<p>Again, this comes from the idea that they need to make their profits look better and better because their stockholders demand it, which is sometimes at odds with what the players are looking for.<p>Do you think Maxis failed on its own, or is there the possibility that EA milked it dry and left it to die? If the latter, why would they do that? Not because it&#x27;s good for the company long-term, but because it makes their bottom line look good just before annual profit reports are coming out. Think about it: SimCity was rushed out to meet a deadline of the end of EA&#x27;s fiscal year, which happens on March 31st. SimCity was released March 7th, 2013.

What the A57 (and most x86 processors) do is ditch the 1:1 mapping between the instruction set and what the functional units execute. A simple example: in x86, a MOV with a destination in memory is broke down into two micro-ops: one to calculate the store address, and another to put the store data on the internal memory bus. The two operations are executed by different functional units in the backend. In fact, all arithmetic instructions with memory operands are ultimately broken down into separate ALU and load-store micro ops.<p>Microcode also breaks down bigger instructions into internal ones, but the implementation is different. Usually, a micro odds instruction causes the CPU to execute from an internal ROM. This is usually subject to performance constraints. With micro operations, usually the decoder a generate the micro ops directly.",1425566624

I am absent minded and often accidentally leave the house without my wallet and this allows me to still pay for things<p>3.

Most of these language have a distinction between value equal and reference equal.<p>Also in databases you have the issue as well. Relational purist tend want natural keys for a item, but the reality is most database make artificial keys such that two items may have the same properties and are yet distinct due to the artificial key. For instance what is the natural key of a person? Even their DNA sequence may not be unique in the case of twins, or you may have incomplete information, either way you need to give them an artificial key.<p>Much of seems to come down to the observer. In the case of the two spheres, two where observed and given a mental haecceitas instantly. If I examine the identical iron spheres then close my eyes and they are moved into opposite positions, then observe them again I will not be able to determine which is which or if they have changed. Computers are the same way they are typically recording facts and modelling things from the real world, imperfect models based on whats observed.

Yes their managed service cost is quite high, but its worth every penny if you want to sleep well at night.",1224751567

341023,comment,340820,340820,0,0,jbert,,,"He looks at differing error rates for GET/DELETE/PUT to S3. This will presumably include any failures on the network path from the client to the server.<p>Might that be enough to explain the higher rate of failed PUTs?<p>Would anyone expect the <i>effective</i> network path from them to a well-known service like S3 to be noticeably asymmetric (at the levels of failure mentioned in the article)?<p>Most consumers' 1st hop (ADSL or cable) is asymmetric in bandwidth - does that imply the ISP is doing different sums in terms of capacity planning which might cause a difference in packet loss?<p>Does this asymmetry also exist outside of consumer 1st hop connections?<p>Do modern network shapers prioritise download ACK traffic (needed to give the customers those blazing download speeds) over uploaded data (bloody file-sharers)?<p>Lastly - given packet loss as measured by ping includes packets lost up or down, I guess there is no way to measure these independently without some co-operating code at the far end?",1224751472

""we want to tell people that they don't have an authentic product"".  well you can accomplish that without disabling the fake with a simple notification.<p>the public outrage _is_ a little absurd, however. it's as if they don't understand the piracy epidemic.<p>i'd say it's a failure on both sides to think rationally",1224750742

Perhaps I wasn't clear.<p>I was trying to point out that these same pool of people (low-paid workers in India and/or China) are necessary to  the economies of all developed economies. And so it's not really fair to say India isn't a developed economy simply because it contains this pool of people.",1224750597

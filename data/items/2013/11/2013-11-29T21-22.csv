A few suggestions for doing this:<p>- develop a morning ritual.  For me this involves waking up to music a few hours before I have to do any work, making a healthy smoothie for breakfast, doing a few exercises, meditating, and planning my day.<p>- before you start working, plan out your whole day into 25 minute intervals.  Think about what you want to accomplish to grow for yourself first, and then schedule your work around those personal goals.<p>- Keep a journal of your daily plans, and regularly track your progress.  Try using Evernote for this.<p>- Get in the habit of devoting about 10% of your mental resources to directing your own emotions toward thinking positively, focusing, and eliminating your own bad mental habits.<p>Hope some of this helps.",1385761621

Everything produced by the preprocessor is available at runtime as much as anything else.<p>&quot;you have to parse the generics over and over every time you want to use them.&quot;<p>I am not seeing how this affects Go, which does not do inclusion the way C++ does. You run the preprocessor once, it creates some files in the local Go package which you should not manually edit, and from that point on it is just as if you had created them by hand.<p>&quot;You also need to have some facility for collapsing duplicate template instantiations.&quot;<p>This one might be true, but given the cost/benefit tradeoffs, I&#x27;ll pay in some cases. It&#x27;s not as if we&#x27;re talking about a happy paradise in which <i>not</i> having generics solves all my problems; it visibly causes me to violate DRY in some of my code. DRY is the highest principle of software engineering.<p>Plus I&#x27;m not <i>sure</i> it&#x27;s true. With what&#x27;s being described here, you&#x27;ll only be able to instantiate the generics for a given data type within the package that declares that data type, as it involves adding methods. The result may be that you in fact can&#x27;t end up with duplicate instantiations; things outside the package can&#x27;t add methods to data types inside a given package, and true duplicates are trivially detected at compile time. (This is in fact a limitation of the approach, but for this reason may still be a good one. I&#x27;m satisfied to solve 90% of the use case for generics if I can get it without dragging in the pathological stuff.)",1385761389

Or, in my case, to do anything other than the absolute necessities (I am still able to work, barely).<p>In your case, your symptoms seem to be worse than mine by several orders of magnitude (I don&#x27;t want to set the world on fire). If that&#x27;s so, then professionals <i>will</i> be able to recognize them and help you.<p>And it really does help. You may or may not require medication. If you do, you may have to take them for a time, or may never get rid of them. In any case, they need a while to work (on the order of weeks) so, if prescribed, follow the treatment as is and don&#x27;t stop.<p>If you have someone close to you who can help (family? friends?) then get them to help, no matter what. I know that sometimes minor things such as calling doctors and setting up appointments require more energy than what&#x27;s available, so get someone else to do it for you - and drag you to the doctor&#x27;s office if need be.<p>Once you get better and your thoughts clearer, then reevaluate your goals.<p>Oh, and try to reduce your news consumption. I find that they resonate too much with my brain when I am not feeling well.<p>Good luck, and take care.",1385761063

They really only want more data and to make their site more valuable. Is it unfair of me to attribute a rationale to Facebook&#x27;s decision without cold-hard-facts, perhaps.<p>However, lets look at the took cases 1) They actually care about this &#x27;ownership&#x27; 2) They do not care.<p>In case 1), they are afraid to violate a person&#x27;s privacy choice of having a friendship be public. There is essentially a tension between their privacy choices and their &#x27;friends&#x27;. It seems to me that when two choices are odds like this, caution is the best route. For instance, when two people know a secret that relates to both of them, and one feels uncomfortable about revealing it, the general rule of thumb is that you do not reveal (unless its like murder 0.o). Overall, I guess it seems like if you do make it &#x27;public&#x27; it makes someone uncomfortable. While if you do not, it makes someone not get something &#x27;they want&#x27;. In this situation, just err towards caution and make it private. What does everyone else think?<p>In case 2), they just want more data. Well I understand it, but I do not really respect it.

I can&#x27;t think of anything sufficiently valuable that you could offer them in surrender to offset the probability of your launching a second strike and the resultant loss on their part.<p>If they thought they could deliver a knock-out blow to the majority of your arsenal, they&#x27;d do it.

6821029,comment,6820474,6820844,14,0,rbehrends,,,"I have been using Nimrod for some personal projects and internal tools since about version 0.9.0. It is quite usable -- especially the current Github version -- but as you may expect from a 0.x project, it still has some rough edges. These haven&#x27;t stopped me from being productive with it, but you should be prepared for the occasional &quot;huh?&quot; situation (the most common problem I&#x27;ve had was that when I experimented with and learned the language, malformed code that I inadvertently wrote would trigger a compiler error, e.g. an illegal AST exception).<p>If you want to do some serious experimentation with Nimrod, I recommend using 0.9.3 (the Github version). It is considerably more mature and stable than 0.9.2.<p>The one oddity that I&#x27;m still getting used to is Nimrod&#x27;s preference for value types. I.e., the string and seq[T] types use copying for assignment [1] by default, when most other languages assume reference semantics (you can use reference assignment instead, but have to say so explicitly). This may create inadvertent overhead if you are unaware of it, but also avoids some pitfalls you otherwise may run into with mutable strings.<p>As for the default GC, it&#x27;s not that you can actually guarantee a maximum pause time [2]. The GC uses deferred reference counting (i.e., eliding most RC operations and batching the ones that are needed). As long as your data structures are acyclic, that allows for a very low upper bound on GC pause times. Pause times for dealing with cyclic structures depend on the size of the cycles involved (and the size of data structures attached to those cycles). A practical workaround for when you have to deal extensively with cyclic data structures is to make use of the fact that each thread has its own heap: thus, putting all time-critical stuff in one thread where cyclic data structures aren&#x27;t used, and the rest in another thread.<p>[1] Copying is not used for passing arguments to a procedure or for returning a result, only actual assignment.<p>[2] You can influence it to some extent by changing the value of ZctThreshold in system/gc.nim, which specifies the size of the zero count table. Each GC iteration will still have to scan the stack, of course.<p>Edit: Oops, to correct myself, Nimrod does actually have a GC_setMaxPause() procedure, though I still don&#x27;t think it can <i>guarantee</i> hard upper bounds on pause times.",1385759417

So there was actually something left to optimize.<p>Think about it this way: a 20% difference isn&#x27;t unrealistic if you compare -O1 vs. -O3.<p>But it&#x27;s completely unrealistic to expect a 20% improvement if you&#x27;d try this with the machine code generated by a modern C compiler at the highest optimization level.<p>Claiming that JIT compilers outperform static compilers, solely based on this paper, is an untenable position.<p>But, yes, JIT compilers <i>can</i> outperform static compilers under specific circumstances. This has more to do with e.g. better profiling feedback or extra specialization opportunities. But this is not what this paper demonstrates.<p>Many compiler optimizations have strong non-linear costs in terms of the number of control flow edges. A static compiler has to punt at a certain complexity. OTOH a JIT compiler is free to ignore many edges, since it may fall back to an interpreter for cold paths or attach new code anytime later if some edges become hot.<p>One interesting example is auto-vectorization (SIMDization) where static compilers <i>have to</i> generate code for all possible combinations of vector alignments in case the underlying alignment of the participating vectors is not statically known. This quickly gets very expensive in terms of code space. OTOH a JIT compiler can simply specialize to the observed vector alignment(s) at runtime, which show almost no variation in practice.",1385758813

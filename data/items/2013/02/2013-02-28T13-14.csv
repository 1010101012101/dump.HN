> revenue by serving ads next to the content of everyone else but them,<p>That's oversimplifying the service and value Google offers. This is the typical passive-aggressive SEO stance. Deriding Google for the service it offers, but at the same time craving it's attention. Because you know, Google gives you a steady stream of customers.<p>People use Google because it helps get them to the websites that offer the content that people are looking for. It's (relatively) good at matching seekers with the information they seek. That's what brings people back to Google over and over.<p>And so, the page they deliver has value to people.<p>Yes, they scrape content from everyone else. Including themselves (e.g. a search for ""Google webmaster guidelines"" returns support.google.com).<p>They also add to that their special ingredients - algorithms that dissect pages, classifying, inferring meaning, deriving synonyms, inferring intent. Weighing, scoring, evaluating every page out there. So when a customer comes a-querying, it uses those calculated metrics to decide which 10 pages get to be mentioned on a search results page, and what snippet/extract of those 10 pages to show.<p>The value Google adds is the selection of which pages to link to based on the query and what it knows/infers about the pages themselves. That is no trivial thing.",1362059657

I recently decided to get the code I have so far online, even if it's not perfect.<p>Tip: play on Explore mode, it's more fun (though trickier).<p>The game concept is quite unusual, mostly because it ""evolved"" over time rather than being preplanned. I was interning at a social gaming startup where I was tasked with researching HTML5 (they were a Flash shop).<p>I had the idea to do a lemmings-meets-Angry Birds type game, with a ninjas theme, and coded up a very basic demo in HTML5 where you could click and drag ninjas to send them flying as they walked around. That was fun, but not really a game. Then I added a Falling-Sand inspired water simulator, just to see if I could code it up, which turned out to be more fun than the ninjas. Then I added randomly generated caves filled with gold, which turned out to be the nucleus of a playable game.<p>So the odd theme (underground ninjas?) and some of the odd mechanics (endless ninjas?) are attributable to its weird genesis. I did try and carry on with the project after I left that company, but university got in the way.<p>I can think of lots of ways I could improve this game (for a start, I'd change it so you just have one ninja, and collecting gold lets you buy extra lives or powerups) but I've decided it's not the most valuable thing I could be working on right now.

Some might even argue that running a forensic on a computer without the owners permissions is an exploit in itself.<p>Edit: How could such technology be used you say. Package a usb drive that once plugged in, will reboot the machine and load a Linux distribution. Once loaded, it automatically modify the windows system and transfer any interesting data it find. Afterward, it erase itself and reboots, thus looking like any empty usb drive once windows boots up.

It seems like a simple optimization to scan a selector for the most efficient parts and use that as your starting point (with ids being a no-brainer).<p>Obviously given the selector ""div #foo a {}"" (obviously a dumb selector, but...) it would be smarter to look for #foo and verify it was inside a div than get every div and search for a #foo. And by extension ""div .foo a {}"" (assuming .foo really is way more efficient than div, which again I find hard to believe given there's native support for getElementsByTagType).<p>It seems to me that the effectiveness of using classes probably stems from browsers optimizing against use cases like ""OMG folks are using Dijit and hanging twelve classes off every div"".

I expect that it will improve in the future and ultimately bitcoin will be better store of value then official currencies, because the savings will not lose the value ove years due to inflation.<p>But fortunately bitcoin has great use even today in its current state. It is great for sending or accepting money internationaly, quickly and without ridiculous transaction fees.

5298474,comment,5296005,5297982,1,0,Isofarro,,,"> Is it the owners responsibility to do something about that?<p>Reasonably, yes. But, when the volume of spam becomes too much to handle, what can a poor webmaster do?<p>I quite like that Google have altered their algorithm to penalise this SEO behaviour. Because it now puts the headache firmly on the website that paid SEO people to originally spam those links.<p>And I applaud and support the webmaster who requested payment for removing the link. The link was placed by a link spammer on behalf of their client, it's only right that that client, after benefitting from that tactic - risk free - now should pay for it to be removed.<p>Granted, there are negative SEO connotations to this, but factors like link-age can be used to spot who was link spamming before Penguin/Panda, and who is link spamming after.<p>I would be thoroughly impressed with an SEO agency who was practicing this now negative SEO tactic before links from spammy neighbourhoods were risk free. And thus benefitting by giving their competition a headache post Penguin and Panda.<p>I have no sympathy for companies that hired SEO agencies who link-spammed their website. They shouldn't have done it (ethic-deprived), and if they didn't know about it they should have known about it (abrogation of responsibility). If there was deceit involved, then the company can take it up with the SEO agency that created that deceit.<p>Yes, clean SEOers are doing a roaring trade trying to clean up these websites, but they must realise their client caused the initial damage by hiring bad SEOers, and they are not entitled to free link removals.",1362056874

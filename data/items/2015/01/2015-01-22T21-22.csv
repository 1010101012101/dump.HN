In which case you would likely want to physically disable inputs and sensors like cameras, mics, location hardware, etc. 
I seem to also recall once reading that it was good measure to use a laptop with a removable battery, having actually removed the battery and only being powered by your power cord.

As the author is the CEO of the company that issued the infamous &quot;Heartbleed Challenge&quot;, he should acknowledge that far from being some war of geeks vs spies, it&#x27;s geeks vs malicious hackers. Yes, as far as Google&#x27;s concerned, GCHQ fits that description, but it&#x27;s silly to claim it&#x27;s just about them. Even if you consider some intelligence agencies benign, there are a hundred-fold more that definitely aren&#x27;t.<p>And the only underestimation happening here is the politicians&#x27;. If the cryptopocalypse were to happen tomorrow (i.e. David Cameron&#x27;s fantasy), modernity would end as we know it. Financial markets wouldn&#x27;t so much collapse as cease to exist. Hungarians recently took to the streets over a tax on data; what would happen if e-commerce became impossible? Imagine the impact on the rule of law if 10% of the economy disappeared overnight.

For example:<p>- the text editor supports elastic tabstops<p>- its documentation is embedded right into the development environment, beautifully complete and well written, and filled with great little examples<p>- compilation error messages are delightfuly detailed, specific, and useful. But if the same error is repeated, the compiler usually tells you &quot;again, this doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot; rather than hitting you with a wall of repetition.<p>- many of the language&#x27;s tools are for creating new language syntaxes for you to write your program with, rather than for the player to use in the game. You can create your own nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions to use in  your descriptions of the world.<p>- Its relationships system is very powerful, and includes first-class support for performing operations on the graphs defined by relationships. For example, rooms are related by adjacency, and you can enquire what room is &#x27;the next step via the adjacency relation&#x27; from one room towards another to have characters navigate towards a goal - but equally you can create our own relationships and perform similar operations on those.<p>- in spite of the syntactic restrictions of trying to &#x27;read like English&#x27;, it surfaces surprisingly rich functional and generics syntaxes; there&#x27;s a real, grown-up programming language in there.<p>It is definitely worth a weekend play, if you&#x27;re looking for a completely different kind of language for a change.",1421962829

8931900,comment,8930825,8931528,0,0,dsacco,,,"Yep. Information security is a nonalgorithmic problem. Much as people might like to disagree or pretend otherwise, it is fundamentally at odds with a service that can scale to meet the needs of clientele in an automated manner. The most successful companies in that space are consultancies that can deliver personalized results to every client on every engagement, and while they are very successful, they will never be what venture capitalists want.<p>It feels good to try and form a business model on prevalent security themes like, &quot;Think like an attacker&quot; and &quot;How do we develop preventative measures before we get hacked?&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t actually stop incidents from happening. There&#x27;s no perfect security, just good enough security based on what a company can invest and how much risk it wants to manage.<p>This is something I&#x27;ve found most startup folks are really resistant to, because it means that they can&#x27;t commercialize security services in the same way you can commercialize web hosting. That&#x27;s understandably upsetting to them, when you see how trendy security has become in the media, and how successful a company could become by capitalizing on it.<p>I think the section any VC or investor has on security potential is going to remain naive for a long time. Semantic desires like &quot;I don&#x27;t want my mail to be read by other people&quot; simply don&#x27;t map very well to purely mathematical operations encapsulating privacy and security in software. Organizing security vulnerabilities into neat taxonomies makes security folks sleep well at night and gives the appearance of an ordered checklist you can build a product on, but in practice that&#x27;s never the case.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think security should be the sole product or service anyone tries to base a startup on. I am really excited about virtual reality and machine learning companies, however. I&#x27;d really love to see some hard innovations and improvements in that space.

From what I have said several times on HN now:<p>Concurrency is a statement about a <i>duration</i> of time. Parallelism is a statement about a <i>moment</i> in time.<p>During a one second window, did both of the tasks execute? If yes, then they are concurrent. If no, then they are not concurrent in that window.<p>Was there any moment in time when both tasks were executing simultaneously? If yes, then they executed in parallel. If no, then they did not execute in parallel. From this, it&#x27;s easy to see that if something is parallel, it must also be concurrent - in order for two tasks to execute during the same moment in time, they must also both have executed during a window of time.<p>Concurrency without parallelism happens on machines with a single core. Processes and threads must time-share the only core. Frequently, some of these processes will have multiple threads, so the threads need to synchronize with each other, even though they don&#x27;t execute at the same time.",1421962564

I&#x27;ve had a lot of people ask me about how our expenses work out, so I figure I&#x27;ll be a little bit transparent in hopes of helping newer folks out.<p>Person 1: Business/operations/marketing/CEO stuff (but still likes to get hands dirty in code when possible). 60k/yr, lots of stock.<p>Person 2: Brilliant programmer, mostly back-end. 115k/yr, lots of stock (family + student loans).<p>Person 3: Good programmer, mostly front-end. 120k/yr, a little stock.<p>Person 4: Great designer/product/UX. Can write HTML/CSS/JS, but it&#x27;s usually faster for him to pass it off to #3. $100k/yr, a little stock.<p>The salaries are, of course, dependent on our needs and personal circumstances. The person who makes 60k has practically no expenses, at least relative to some of the other members of the team. We&#x27;re also distributed geographically, so the salaries will change slightly in SF vs. middle-of-nowhere, but that&#x27;s the gist of what I consider the classic team.<p>After taxes, office space, etc. Our burn will last us just more than 18 months (we&#x27;re frugal on this stuff - didn&#x27;t need new computers or many monitors or other stuff). We also spend about $500/month on various types of software. If something slows us down even a couple days, it&#x27;s cheaper for us to buy a software solution than to pay salaries while everyone works through it manually.<p>Everyone has to be a generalist to a certain extent, but we all naturally gravitate to what we&#x27;re good at. It took us a long time to hire person #3 - we thought we would be able to get away without him/her, but adding him/her feels like it&#x27;s doubled the rate at which we can ship product. We formerly compensated for it by having #1 and #4 do his job, and that really slowed things down.<p>Now we have every opportunity to do what we need to do.

Text based games have always captured my interest and I often tell my friends that there is no better graphics engine than your imagination.  Many of the games I made in my spare time were text based in nature like old school professional wrestling sims, adventures games, etc and there is a surprisingly high number of people in the world who still enjoy them (young and old) as is evidenced by this article and my latest game (shameless plug in 3, 2, 1: Pit of War [1]).  I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever spent money on a mobile game because its awesome 3D graphics, but I have spent money on a mostly text based game with an awesome story, or something like Gemini Rue with its retro style graphics and intriguing story and will happily do so again.  Story is key for these types of games and I believe they leave a much longer lasting impression, at least for me anyway.  My game that I mentioned above is more of a strategy pvp arena fighting game so there isn&#x27;t the story element there yet (it is planned for 2015), however, I often get emails from my players telling me how much they enjoy the fact it is text based and they&#x27;re happy to support continued development.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this genre out if you are small team or just one person.  You won&#x27;t get fawned over by the press but you&#x27;ll have the ability to create a rich, fun and detailed world and with some creatively placed still images and an engaging story or game mechanics many people out there will pay you for your efforts if that is one of your goals.  Be attentive to your player base, be good to them and they will reward you in spades for keeping one of their favorite genres alive that the mainstream have all but called dead and buried many times over.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pitofwar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pitofwar.com</a>",1421961650

My certainty also does not have the same magnitude as yours but on the inverse vector. Someone will inevitably premise a reply on the idea that it does, though.<p>My understanding, after reading the news and the relevant stuff on freebarrettbrown.org (which collects a bunch of filings) is that he faced sentencing for three counts: (i) concealing laptops during the execution of a warrant, (ii) threatening an FBI agents, and (iii) being an accessory after the fact to the STRATFOR hack.<p>Of those three, (i) and (ii) seem open-and-shut. Even Brown&#x27;s own motion to dismiss concedes them. (The more damning of the two, about the laptops, was accompanied with a sort of harebrained argument that it&#x27;s not a crime to conceal evidence so long as you hide it somewhere in the scope of the search warrant, so that it is at least mathematically possible that agents executing the warrant could have found it.) He plead guilty to them, then discussed them in their particulars at his allocution.<p>Accessory-after-the-fact liability for relaying a URL to a bunch of stolen credit cards is a fuzzier charge. I have no idea what I think about it. But two things worth considering:<p>(1) Accessory-after-the-fact liability is a much lesser offense than being an accomplice to the STRATFOR hack. Accomplice liability would have charged him as a principal to the actual crime. That&#x27;s not what he got convicted for.<p>(2) The charge doesn&#x27;t criminalize sharing of URLs, but rather <i>intentionally</i> facilitating the spread of stolen credit card numbers. The DOJ had the burden of proving intent. His &quot;actus reus&quot; was, I think we all agree, very minimal. But his mens rea might not have been.<p>His vulnerability to having mens rea proven at trial was probably greatly enhanced by the fact that one of the open-and-shut charges against him was about his effort to shield Jeremy Hammond from prosecution. It would have been hard for him to argue that he wasn&#x27;t much more intimately involved in the STATFOR hack than some Twitter rando RT&#x27;ing a URL would have been.<p>I dunno.

As an interviewer I care very little about your thesis, about your advisor, and about which papers you are current researching. I DO care that you spent a significant amount of time solving problems. You found a problem, you stuck with it, and you solved the problem. Again, I have my own problems, I don&#x27;t care at all about the problem you solved to get your PhD, just that you did! You have a HUGE ability to stick with things, this is an asset. Practice getting this out during your interviews. Make sure they know this is a skill they need within their organization and that regardless of the challenge, you will conquer it.<p>Second, you have a lot of languages. There is nothing wrong with that, but tune your resume and your interview towards the one this potential employer needs. You mention that you study a lot. Spend that time studying the needs of the person you are interviewing with. Know a lot about their product, about their environment, and about their history. Be ready to talk to them about all of these things. Defend your &quot;mini thesis&quot; about this organization every time you walk into an interview with them.<p>Third, practice confidence. I know this is easier said than done. I am not always confident in myself nor in my abilities. But I practiced and I show confidence when I walk into an interview. This helps a lot. Control the interview by asking questions, talking about what they need, knowing what to say when you get stuck, and showing your skills even when you feel nervous or scared that things aren&#x27;t going well. Over the years some of my best jobs came from interviews that I was SURE I bombed miserably. Use your study time to practice these skills for a while. Never call yourself half as*ed again. Ever.<p>Finally, practice interview questions! Google &quot;interview code questions&quot; and practice one a day. Practice them in different languages. Really understand why you use some of the techniques that you use. You have an AMAZING ability to study, learn, reason, and defend your ideas. Use these skills to your advantage. You will do well!<p>Final Note: interviewing is a numbers game. You have to interview with a lot of companies to get where you want. You are already playing it well. Keep interviewing because you only have to pass that one best interview to get that one best job that you have been looking for. You can do it!",1421961256

I asked if you could point who these people were. I&#x27;m genuinely curious to learn and understand how in modern times -- where people with their elaborate plans, not snakes with their instantaneous attacks, are the common threat -- a person of average or above intelligence could end up risking their own lives without having to involve fear.<p>Your argument for evolutionary conservation doesn&#x27;t hold at all. Intelligence evolved fairly recently (in evolutionary terms) and thus, pending genetic tampering by us, it should take a plenty of time for any such adaptations to be successful. Besides, fear was indeed essential to us prior to intelligence evolving, as the quick and dirty survival mechanism of instincts was all that we had to survive and reproduce successfully.<p>> Why does the only cited example lead an extraordinarily risky life?<p>What I&#x27;m asking, specifically, is: are their other (cited or non-cited) examples of a woman or a man with no fear whatsoever leading an ordinary or below-ordinary life? I&#x27;m more that happy rescind all that I&#x27;ve written to you here if you could successfully provide them. After all, you have a track record of doing meticulous research.<p>> How many white female artists ever get held up like that? Or 4 times? Hell of a coincidence...<p>Are you suggesting that those 4 gunpoint/knifepoint perpetrators were influenced to do so, in part, due to SM being fearless? It really is hard to say without understanding her life context. Besides, this is going down the speculative path.<p>>> All that these scientists could come up with over the years to justify their (and the general public&#x27;s) fear of lack of fear is those four incidents of being held at knifepoint and gunpoint.
> &#x27;All&#x27;?<p>Yes -- and I&#x27;m not too sure what you were aiming to point here -- I took the liberty to assume that people like Antonio Damasio wanted to specifically find out/ bring out incidents from her life to buttress their opinion of fear being essential even to modern humans (he did say this in his book &#x27;The Emotional Brain&#x27;).

If only someone could have saved me the time.<p>There was plenty of criticism from the JS world when Prototype came out, and the main issue everyone had was how Prototype attempted to shoehorn classical OOP into JavaScript (hence, the abuse of prototypes and fake class inheritance), which is a mistake amateur JS developers make to this day. jQuery has at least made it so using the most popular DOM abstraction framework didn&#x27;t also mean you were running less-than-ideal code inherently, but developers still manage to mess this one up.<p>I think it&#x27;s because when you learn how to program, you <i>only</i> learn the classical style, so you&#x27;re not ready for the pitfalls of prototypal inheritance. So a lot of developers go through the &quot;phase&quot; of attempting to retro-fit their own ideas of how programming should work into a language that is designed in a totally different way, inevitably lead to problems, and have &quot;the revelation&quot; of understanding the prototypal inheritance idea. It&#x27;s kind-of like a growing pain, which is why I&#x27;m really happy JS is being taught more heavily in schools and especially to entry-level programmers. Unlike Java, JavaScript is more accessible (just pop open the REPL in <i>any</i> browser) and its results are easier to observe. While it&#x27;s not a great tool to teach people the concepts of OOP, I think it&#x27;s very useful to teach kids at a young age that there isn&#x27;t just one way to do things. They&#x27;re different enough to screw developers up on a day-to-day basis, but not different enough that spending a few weeks with the language isn&#x27;t enough to grasp its power.<p>As others have said, you really didn&#x27;t waste your time there. If anything, it was simply a matter of JS developers collectively and simultaneously going through the same growing pains and eventual realizations about how the language works.",1421960735

proper buffering, and allow any size reads of various packetized data.<p>Of course, I&#x27;d also suggest that whoever was the genius who thought it
was a good idea to read things ONE F<i>CKING BYTE AT A TIME with system
calls for each byte should be retroactively aborted. Who the f</i>ck does
idiotic things like that? How did they noty die as babies, considering

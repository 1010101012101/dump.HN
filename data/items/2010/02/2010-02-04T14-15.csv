So did the profitability of the Office division suffer from not engaging the tablet?

It's not a good idea to wrap that into a function, together with the code that is supposed to be executed, because you are mixing two completely different kinds of information into some new function. This code is being too clever for it's own good: it condenses information so far that you are forced to think harder about what each piece means. I consider this is one of the main dangers of languages like Ruby: it's proponents lose sight of the fact that they are coming full circle, back to writing code that's so clever that no one in the future will understand it.<p><i>every web library I've used has worked this way.</i><p>I doubt that we've used a disjoint set of web libraries, so my only answer can be: no, they haven't worked that way.

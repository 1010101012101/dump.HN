5447300,comment,5445159,5445925,1,0,robomartin,,,"First:  Je viens en paix.  So, please, don't turn this into a mud-slinging competition.<p>Also, because of the ambiguity that exists in the English language I should clarify that this is addressed to the general HN audience rather than to api.  In other words, when I use ""you"" it is generally meant as the plural ""you"".<p>I have a genuine problem understanding where anti-capitalism sentiment, particularly in HN, comes from.  I also have a huge problem with pro-government sentiment bordering on socialism and even going as far as having a communist undertone.  I keep seeing this come up again and again on HN and I just don't get it.  I don't understand it.<p>So, this is me asking for help.  Why do you (plural) think this way?<p>Again, please, I am looking for a respectful conversation. This is about you, not me.  I want to understand you.  I have lots of questions.  Some might sound dumb and maybe even off-base.  Go with me, if you will, humor me, and see if you can help me --and others-- understand where you are coming from.<p>How far back in human history do we have to go until you would concede we don't owe what existed at that point in time to state-funded research?  Fire?  Hunting? The wheel?  Agriculture?  Making clothes?  Making boats?  Domestication of animals?  Medieval time?  Industrial revolution?<p>And, when feudal lords enslaved the population, was that population to be thankful because of the developments that came from such ""state-funded"" efforts?<p>Communism funded lots of things.  Not sure anything of use to the world at large came out of any communist country.  Do you think communism is better than capitalism?  Why? How about socialist ideas?  Better than capitalism?<p>The Nazi's funded a lot of medical research in the context of killing millions of Jews.  Are you suggesting that we all benefit from that today?  Are there a few million people somewhere in the world you would be willing to kill today in order to do some state-funded research that would benefit us all?<p>I know this is a ridiculous and grotesque question to ask, but it is a valid question.  If you are deriving any benefit whatsoever from what the Nazi's did then you either have to reject all technology derived from that research --even if it costs your own life or that of your loved ones-- or be willing to do the same in the name of progress.  I am not proposing, for even an instant, that what they did was acceptable.<p>Where do you stop singing the praises of state-funded research?  How many people did ARPANET help kill?  If we owe the modern Internet to all the military programs between 1960 and 199x or so and you recognize this as good; what's the difference between that and the various Nazi programs.  Killing is killing, isn't it?<p>Well, virtually all state-funded research is motivated by war.  War means killing people.  Sometimes by the millions.  Certainly by the thousands.  And, in that regard --in terms of the mass killings-- it is no different from genocide.<p>How about nuclear power?  A great result of state-funded research?  Killed millions.<p>So, in embracing your belief system, do we ever fault governments or do we always look at the rosy side of state-funded research and ignore the ugly parts.  As I asked before, how many people did ARPANET help kill?  Is that ever a consideration?  I am not sure Compuserve and other civilian BBS's helped kill nearly as many people --if any-- as the various means of communication resulting from state-funded research.<p>When I was younger the realities of war never really hit my radar.  As I got older it really started to turn my stomach.  And that's why I developed this idea that we should limit our government to throwing fancy dinners for visiting dignitaries and pull ALL non essential funding from their hands.  All they do is kill people, one way or the other.  The research would be done far better, cheaper, faster and with less violent purposes in the private sector.<p>I prefer capitalism and profit-driven entrepreneurship than war-driven state-sponsored research who's aim is to kill millions.  Do you see the difference?  How does that align with your pro-state belief system?<p>That aside, on the assumption a rare state-funded project produces something of note, for how many decades or centuries should we be thankful?<p>Do advancements ever become part of human culture and intellectual property upon which we can build without being labeled as having taken advantage of those before us?<p>Are you of this opinion because you have studied the subject or because you were indoctrinated into this manner of thinking at school or at home?<p>It's an honest question.  Please don't be offended by it.<p>As an example, most religions folks were indoctrinated into their religion.  I don't know anyone who grew up without any kind of religion shoveled at them as a kid, only to choose one independently as an adult.<p>It is a fair question:  Are you pro state/government/communism/socialism because you chose to believe this way or because the thoughts were shoveled into your head?  Can you remove yourself from your mind far enough to even make that evaluation?<p>All forms of governments, from democratic to communist seem to be great at devising ways to kill people.  If WW1 and WW2 --with over a hundred million people dead-- did not prove that, I don't know what would.<p>It is also interesting to note that governments seem to need war as a motivator to invent anything.  Why?  Is that the only goal they understand?<p>Can you reconcile your ""more government is good"" view of the world with the fact that governments --not people-- have started all known wars and that they have caused the death of hundreds of millions of people throughout history?  People don't start wars.  Governments do.<p>I sincerely reject the idea that ""All this stuff we're gluing together is the product of state-funded research"".  There are countless innovations that originated far, far away from government.  Too many examples to list, but such things as flying machines, the telegraph and the light bulb come to mind.<p>Now, it is natural for entrepreneurs to look for markets for their inventions.  Governments are flush with cash.  In the US, if you can mold your idea or invention into something that can be of benefit to our mighty armed forces you can get tons of money for further development and even hugely profitable contracts through programs such as SBIR.<p>Entrepreneurs look for markets where they can make money.  This means that while I am sure someone is going to claim that aviation was funded by government, I will propose the opposite:  Aviation entrepreneurs went where the money was: Military contracts.<p>I could go on, but it is time to listen.  There are a lot of questions above.  I ask you to think, really think about them and then give me your perspective.  And, again, I mean this with the utmost respect.  I truly want to understand.  I have seen enough pro socialist/communist/government/state posts on HN to cause me pause.  I don't know if these are coming from outside the US (or outside democratic/capitalistic cultures) or from within.  Don't know.  Please, help me understand you.",1364349361

Called university, asked if going to a nearby emergency clinic would be covered. They said ""yes"". Did so. Got there, waited 1+ hours in the lobby. Then a young intern saw me for 5 minutes. Prescribed a codeine pill and sent me home.<p>It turns out outside of campus clinic visit was not covered. I did not record the phone conversation.

It seems they are out to rob people I wouldn't even feel back screwing them over. Charging a student who lives on rammen noodles $400 in 1999 could mean not being able to pay for housing or not being able to avoid food or books.<p>Now I just avoid doctors as much as possible. It is irrational but I just feel like both insurance and doctors are out to screw me and take all my money. Sad thing is, my rational part of the brain understand that the next time I will see doctors might be in the emergency being unconscious or really sick (maybe I should carry a wallet with a fake name with me ;-)",1364349330

Half a year ago she (we?) got pregnant, and we are paying more than triple the money for doctor visits than it would be back home. Not only that - but the money we're paying is just 20% of the ""real"" cost, the insurance she paid $7000 per year for is paying the rest. So we're paying $180 per visit and the ""real"" cost of each half an hour long doctor visit is about $900!<p>Now you might argue it's better service, but in my very subjective view, I highly doubt it and it doesn't feel like it at all. To add insult to injury: We got a 3D sonogram and the amount we paid (mind you, 20% of the ""real"" cost) was twice the amount our friends at home have paid for 3D sonogram taken by a private company (and the government is not paying a cent).<p>IMO, America is one fantastic country if you're rich - but it seems much much harder to live here than in Europe on meager salaries.",1364349014

Most 17-year-olds aren't programming at all. However, this is an HR acquisition (they're shutting Summly down). What exactly does a 17-year-old have that merits a $30m hiring bonus?<p>I'm not ragging on him, at all. I think it's great for him. He had the opportunity and took it. That's awesome. But... what are Yahoo's executives thinking?<p>When DE Shaw hires Putnam Fellows, they start them at $150-200k. Not $30 million. They have to work their way up to that.<p>I'm not asking this out of resentment, because I don't care. Yahoo could have acquired him for $500m and I wouldn't care. I'm asking that out of honest curiosity. If you're that desperate for talent that you're hiring 17-year-olds (very good 17-year-olds, no doubt) with a $30m hiring bonus instead of a much more reasonable, I don't know, $500k, then what did you do so wrong as to get there?<p>See, I'm sure there <i>are</i> economic reasons for large companies to buy goofy startups for $7 million per engineer. But that's a sign that either (a) they're all seriously underpaying their people, and it's systemic across the Valley, or (b) their internal cultures are so stifling of creativity that they're desperate for innovation, and the only thing they can come up with is to massively overpay ""credible"" people from the outside instead of developing internal talent.<p>I suspect that it's both (a) and (b). In fact, I've been inside enough short-sighted, badly-run companies to know that it is.<p>It's of personal interest to me. Companies are literally in headline-making death throes because they can't get people like me, and when one of us shows up-- we aren't <i>that</i> rare, maybe 1 in ~100 software engineers-- they treat us like shit. It's bizarre.<p>Here's a proposal to all the large corporations out there. For a mere $2500 per hour I, Michael O. Church, will tell you how to unfuck your inefficient, talent-stifling culture. CEO of a megalith that can't hire good people without a 5-million-per-engineer acq-hire? (Actually, you probably <i>have</i> good people-- some much better than I am-- but the dopey middle managers keep you from seeing their talents. Fire them. That'll be $175.) I will help you change that. All you have to do is listen to me. After 200 hours (that's a mere $500k) you will no longer to acq-hire at $5-10m per engineer to get good teams. You'll be able to do it for <i>$3m</i> per engineer because people will actually want to work for you. Or, better yet, you'll be able to get good people the old-fashioned way.<p>Mark Zuckerberg is young and rich, but he actually built a free-standing company.

An recent gripe is that when you use it as a feed proxy it doesn't pass along subscriber numbers like any other good feed parser, so a FeedBurner feed of a FeedBurner feed doesn't pass long info to the original FeedBurner feed or feed (but will pass along downloads, though it's only because FeedBurner is just a glorified Location header then.) I originally only went with FeedBurner over an open solution for expediency, but I've never liked giving Google more information on our users or giving up my control of our feeds to a product that has been limping along for years. It wouldn't take much effort to replicate FeedBurner. Maybe it's time I hunker down and do it. I've been planning for a FeedBurner switch since the beginning by using its ""branded"" feed feature and using a subdomain of ours for feed hosting. I hope everyone else has been wise enough to do so, as well, though looking at our network membership feeds, I know they haven't.",1364347527

Not only was the infrastructure around us mostly built during that time (the highways, power plants, etc) but most concepts in computing: programming languages, AI, GUIs, databases, etc.<p>Over time I become more and more convinced that the market doesn't produce (much) real innovation. If you look at the stuff that really matters, it's come from one of three sources:<p>1) Government research labs (NASA) or government funded defense contractors (Lockeed-Martin, SRI, BBN, etc)<p>2) Government funded universities (MIT and its $1 billion in defense contracts each year)<p>3) Private companies that have either monopolies (AT&T Bell Labs) or massive market power with entrenched cash-cow products (IBM, Xerox PARC).<p>Look at innovation that's happening now. Where is it happening? Self-driving cars got a big boost from DARPA in the early 2000's (DARPA Grand Challenge), and is now being funded by Google (which has a ton of cash from its deeply entrenched position in search).",1364347470

5447131,comment,5446634,5446634,2,0,booleandilemma,,,"I was in your situation about three years ago, and I'll tell you what I did.\nI found a startup company that was willing to hire me for $15/hour as a low level computer tech. A computer janitor, essentially. I worked ""in the field"". My job roles consisted of configuring hundreds of computers by hand, performing keyboard and screen replacements, and occasionally having to physically deliver dozens of computers to our clients' office locations.\nMy fellow techs had never progressed beyond high school, and I had just graduated a liberal arts college with a CS degree. I felt a little ashamed.\nTo get attention from management, I started writing software to automate a large portion of my job. Surprisingly, and fortunately for me, no one had thought to do this before. The company's sysadmin was excellent, but he lacked a flair for programming. Management soon moved me into a sysadmin role, and I became the company's go-to guy for writing programs that would make configuration changes to our thousands of client machines in the field. My pay was increased and I got a desk. It helped greatly that I was the only person in our company's US office that had any programming ability.\nI guess my advice to you is to first get your foot in the door doing the most trivial work they'll give you, and then show them what you're really capable of.",1364346421
5447130,comment,5444878,5445716,1,0,xenophanes,,,"> I know you want to believe that it costs Apple $559 to make that $600 phone, but it doesn't.<p>Did you miss the part where i mentioned iPhone margins are over 50%? I know that margins over 50% means it costs apple less than $300 to make an iPhone, not $559.<p>Or something in that ballpark. Margins are lower on the smallest iPhones and go up a great deal on the ones with higher capacity. Putting in a little more flash storage costs apple very little compared to the extra $100-200 they charge for it, the margins on that are much higher than on the base phone.<p>All I was saying is that i think iPhone components and manufacturing labor genuinely do cost more than for iPad mini, and retina costs more than non-retina. Here are some rough guesses, I think they are in the right ballpark:<p><pre><code>  >> 260 / (1 - 0.6)\n  => 650.0\n  >> 230 / (1 - 0.33)\n  => 343.283582089552\n</code></pre>\nMaybe iPhone costs 260 to make and has 60% margins, and iPad mini costs 230 to make and has 33% margins. The results are in the right area for the average selling price of the devices.<p>This would put the cost of materials $30 apart. If the retina screen costs an extra $15, it actually accounts for half the difference in component costs, it's significant. (higher margins are more significant, of course)<p>Or maybe non-retina screens are $20, and retina are $30. Then the retina ones cost 50% more, that's significant (and still 1/3 of the component cost differences).",1364346408
5447129,comment,5446634,5446634,44,0,bazillion,,,"Honestly, probably one of the best things you could do is join the military.  If you are tech savvy, then chances are that you can score high enough on the ASVAB (entry test) in order to get into a really high speed career field.  I joined the Navy, became an arabic linguist, left after a few years, and got a programming job as a contractor for 102k/year.  Here's the process you're looking at if you want to take a similar route:<p>1) See your local (you might have to travel a bit) recruiting station and ask to start the process in joining.  I recommend the Navy of all branches, because I've worked with people of all the other branches and the Navy gives you the most potential to succeed long-term -- they are the only ones that promote the idea of cross-training, will burn away your outer weakness by some extremely crappy years of work ultimately making you a better person, and allow you more technological opportunities than any other branch.<p>2) Your recruiter will ask you about your past.  This will include drug use, prior convictions, etc.  Hopefully you don't have any felony charges, or you won't be able to join.  There are waivers for various offenses, but some will preclude you from getting a security clearance job.<p>3) Take the ASVAB.  It is an extremely simple test which tests very basic concepts that you should already have formed a mental model about if you're a halfway decent programmer.  Example:  This lamp post is 30 feet tall and casts a 50 foot shadow -- What is the hypotenuse? (That was a real question).  There are also mechanical things (what type of wrench is this?) and basic english things.  Score in the 80+ range (out of a possible 99...which I maxed out without breaking a sweat and I'm not a genius) and you can almost guarantee yourself a security clearance job.<p>4) Your recruiter will take you to a MEPS station.  After they do a bunch of physical tests on you (normal physician tests like stripping you down and checking your parts), you will be taken to the most important leg of the journey -- the guy that will assign you your rating.  If you did well on your ASVAB, this part will be a breeze, because he will mostly be interested in fitting you in to where you're comfortable.  As a programmer, your goal is to get one of these ratings in order to get yourself into a job that can leverage your skills.  Even though I was an arabic linguist, I was allowed to build unlimited amounts of tools in order to support missions, and that eventually just became my job.  I was in the military and could come in to work whenever I wanted to and basically do whatever I wanted to.  This is the exception more than the rule, however, but it's still a possibility if you have an excellent work ethic.  The jobs that get you into said positions are:  CTI, CTT, CTN, CTR, IT (secure).  All of these will require a 6 year obligation (4 year + 2 year extension).<p>5) Boot camp.  It was basically one of the more enjoyable periods of my life.  Every day is mapped out on a bi-hourly basis about what you're going to be doing from the minute you get there to the minute you graduate.  You can look on the schedule and see what you're going to be doing 2 hours and 4 weeks later, and that will be exactly what you'll be doing.  The structure will allow you find out things about yourself and your capabilities which you might not be aware of.  I had barely graduated high school (1.8 gpa) and had a couple months of work at subway, but the experience awakened a great motivation to succeed in me, and it just might do the same for you too.<p>6) A-School.  Depending on the rating (job) you chose, this will be different.  For the non-CTI jobs, you'll be going to lovely (sarcasm) Pensacola, FL.  The experience is great, and it's a good stepping stone to re-introduce you back into the world after having everything taken away from you in boot camp.  If you chose CTI then you'll be going to the Defense Language Institute (DLI).  It's basically college, except you're paid to go.  Would recommend.<p>7) C-School -- most likely still in Pensacola if you're a non-CTI, and if you're a CTI it will just be at your final duty station.  This will be where you learn more advanced things, and will be influenced by your scores on tests in A school.  The great part about this is that there's no homework since everything is classified, which is why I was able to do really well here.  Only knowledge and practical ability matters (which is the common theme that you'll find in most of the Navy).<p>8) Final duty station.  This can be many places around the world, but if you specifically want to program then you want to be stationed at an NSA facility.  The NSA is the <i>only</i> government agency that really promotes people to think outside the box -- trust me, I've worked at all of the others.  I never programmed anything for real until I went there, and there was a program we used where you had to add the number 9 to a calculation before entering it in.  I asked ""shouldn't the computer just do that?"" and no matter how many trouble tickets we submitted, no one would resolve it.  So, I asked the person who had created the program 20 years ago if I could modify the program to fix it -- he handed me the Perl cookbook and said go for it.  That spawned an entire career.  You'll find that people there, although <i>odd</i>, will be more open to change than anywhere else in the government.<p>Once you have 6 years in (which will be the minimum for a job like this), you'll be 28/29 with a lot of skills, experience, and a security clearance.  You'll have met people working at various contracting companies that will hire you, or you can apply at various government agencies that will easily snatch you up.<p>About me: I started out as an EW (electronic warfare technician) tech which was 2 years of electronics schooling.  I served on a ship for 2 years and cross-rated to CTI to learn arabic.  After finishing 9 years total in the Navy, I collected a total of 62,000 dollars in bonus money.  I left the Navy with no debt, a car, a lot of money in the bank, a 92k offer and a 102k offer and three full months of collecting my Navy paycheck after leaving (terminal pay).  I took the higher job offer and worked that for a year, conceiving of, writing the requirements for, and building (by myself) a computer program that saved the government an estimated 3 million dollars (along with writing a bunch of piddly scripts and API's that have saved a few million more and continue to be used).  I'm 29 now and have saved up enough money that I dont have to work for 2 years and can focus on bootstrapping my own startup.  The Navy and my work ethic (and ability to save money) gave me that, and it can give it to you too.<p>If you'd like more information, message me and I'd be glad to help.",1364346384

I say, go him!<p>The next time I am looking for work I am seriously considering getting rid of the resume and coming up with a bullshit startup name. It's pretty ridiculous that my ""acq-hire"" value in a startup with a bullshit product would be about 50 times the market salary for someone at my level of skill. (I've seen enough inside numbers to know that this is not an exaggeration. Acq-hire values are $2-4M for mediocre engineers and $4-10M for good ones.)<p>One could do major social-proof arbitrage by offering cuts (of future acq-hires) to people in the tech press. I am dead-fucking-sure this is already happening. It must be. The stakes are too high, and the players too degenerate.<p>On to the main point: yeah, it is terrifying that large corporate cultures are <i>that</i> desperate for innovation.

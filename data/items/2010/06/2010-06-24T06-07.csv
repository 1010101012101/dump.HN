The obvious thought is that they want to gut the DMCA safe harbor, but this seems like it would make combating piracy harder in the long run.<p>The safe harbor is the carrot offered so that service providers respond to DMCA takedown notices. Without that carrot, or with it much farther away, service providers are less likely to cooperate with Viacom.<p>Viacom is setting the playing field for service providers like this:
1. Dedicate resources to DMCA takedowns and then spend millions defending your safe harbor status anyway, or
2. Spend millions in copyright fines<p>This is a bad playing field to set, the DMCA takedown is a pretty sweet deal for Viacom. Why spoil it by making option 2 so attractive to service providers?

1457464,comment,1453259,1457264,0,0,davidkellis,,,"As far a runtime performance goes, my backtesting framework would run slightly slower  using intraday price history than it does with EOD data.<p>There are two reasons why:<p>1. There would be more data to load into memory, and that process of loading the price history from a CSV file into memory would take a little longer simply because there is more data to deal with.<p>2. The data structure I'm using to index the historic price information by timestamp is the Java 6 implementation of TreeMap. The TreeMap class is an implementation of a Red-Black tree, and provides a guarantee that lookup operations (even when the key is not present in the collection) are O(log n). Since the time to find a key in the collection is O(log n), there would be a small performance hit when adding more data to the collection.<p>I actually began using intraday price history that I had downloaded from TradeStation, but I ran into the problem that I only had intraday price history over a 1-year period. I needed to be able to run 1-year trials over the course of a much larger period of time, so I switched to EOD data. Switching to EOD data had the nice side effect of speeding up my program (mainly due to the fact that loading all that intraday price history into memory took several seconds - up to 30 seconds or so).",1277361560

As time goes on, an increasingly large slice of the U.S. (and world) economy is coming from non-physical goods like software, movies, writing, speaking, etc.  Politicians who acknowledge this would want to promote an economic environment that will let these growing industries thrive.  I would imagine this is the thinking behind ACTA - we want the world to respect copyright since we expect to rely heavily on it.  While people like to (rightly) point out that a downloaded song or movie is not equal to a lost sale, the potential for easy, private transfer of data WILL eat into sales significantly over time if not ""controlled.""<p>What the politicians don't seem to acknowledge is that the products of this process are not scarce (although the inputs to the process are).  Enforcing the illusion of scarcity (particularly with all the great privacy/crypto we have) must be extremely heavy-handed.  We'll have to choose between severe restrictions in our communication (which should bother everyone) and less production of the software and movies that we desire (which would be unfortunate).",1277361178

1457420,comment,1456026,1456026,0,0,eston,,,"One of my last undergraduate reports as an economics student at the University of Michigan in 2007 was on the ""true cost"" of watered urinals vs. waterless urinals for the campus. The waterless ones were primarily used in the Dana (Environmental Sciences) building, which even had expensive composting toilets- basically large, windy abysses which you defecated into.<p>We spent nearly a month doing research on vendors for waterless urinals as well as attempting to model the cost of negative externalities from the water use (sewer system upgrades, water treatment) and the waterless ones (manufacturing and disposal of cartridges, smell and hygiene.)<p>Whilst I can't locate a PDF of the report anymore, the evidence came out overwhelmingly in favour of the watered urinals. The cost of the waterless filters and hardware, even if all of the waterless urinals were installed new, was still over 2x the cost of running watered urinals at the University, externalities included (I think it was nearly 6x IIRC.)<p>I can't imagine these being useful for many municipalities – including the more water-scarce ones — unless costs have <i>really</i> dropped.",1277359891

Words such as ""know"", ""believe"", ""think"" and ""suspect"" don't express these things properly, but we have to make do with what we have.<p>I don't think that ""believe"" is a particularly bad word for the relationship of a rational person to a fairly well established fact, though. I believe, for instance, that the Earth has an iron-nickel core. I fully acknowledge the possibility that it might not, and am fully ready to change that belief based on new evidence, but I think it's fairly well established and I am willing to act as if it were true.",1316833099

What is this if not ""a chauvinistic belief in the inferiority of women?"" [1]</i>*<p>Actually I was claiming that young men are more likely to be interested in programming today than women. The culture of what it means to be a programmer has changed, and the idea of spending ten hours a day slinging Javascript around in order to query some database appeals to a fairly limited subset of the population, who tend overwhelmingly to be male. Whether this subset are the lucky few or the unlucky few is rather a matter of interpretation.<p>Like I said: Sudoku is fun when you do it for ten minutes a day.

3032257,comment,3031574,3031574,12,0,dbingham,,,"Yes, this is a dupe from earlier today.  I posted the damned thing by accident while learning the system in a half awake stupor.  And, because I was in an half awake stupor, decided it was a good idea to share it with the world after accidentally posting it.  I've been trying to get them to take it down to no avail.  Failing that I've suggested better language and asked other people to suggest better language.  On Monday I plan to call the White House switch board and see if I can beg/bully my way to someone with the power to update the text.  The previous thread had my suggestion for better language, but I'll just go ahead and repost it here:<p>----<p>The US Patent system is badly broken with respect to software patents. Patents are being issued to companies for inventions that are, in fact, common knowledge included in any introductory software textbook. The result is that the large software corporations are buying up reams of patents and using them to bully small, innovative companies out of business or into paying ridiculous licensing fees.<p>Quite apart from encouraging innovation, patents are now stifling it.\nThe software industry is one of the few industries still strong in America. Even in a time of recession, there are not enough computer programmers to fill all the available positions. Startup companies are forming and growing readily. But if every line of code written brings with it a potential violation of someone else's intellectual property, this will cease to be the case.<p>To solve this problem, we petition the Obama Administration to direct the Patent office to cease issuing software patents and to instruct the judicial system to take a long hard look at existing patents for validity. With these two steps, those of us in the software industry can stop worrying about mutually assured patent destruction and get back to doing what we do best.<p>----<p>If anyone else comes up with language the community prefers, I'm game to use it when I call the switchboard on Monday.",1316829611

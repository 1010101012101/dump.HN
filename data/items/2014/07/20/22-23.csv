8061819,comment,8060356,8060356,0,0,micro_cam,,,"Ayasdi&#x27;s notion of topological data analysis has to be the most overhyped piece of &quot;math&quot; yet this century. Take a simplistic notion of topological invariance, gloss over how you actually infer things like neighborhood structure to get the topology, slap a slick UI on it, show it works on one out of date breast cancer data set that is tiny by modern standards, charge through the nose and see how far you can ride it.<p>It is kind of shocking that they are now selling it as beneficial in heterogeneous data. Actually learning any structure from highly dimensional heterogenous messy data in a way that doesn&#x27;t just overfit is the crux and, last time I looked, their public papers and other materials suggests they are doing nothing beyond some standard distance metrics. There is lots of other exciting work going on in this area. Topological invariance may provide some assurances what you are seeing is real but kind of just becomes a fancy name for doing parameter sweeps.<p>There are really exciting things going on in manifold learnings and application of (smooth and topological) manifold theory to modern data. This includes applications of discrete exterior calculus to abstract simplical complexes that may not even represent a manifold allowing efficient algorithms for problems like ranking from graph flows (e.g. page rank) and other cool things. Maybe Ayasdi has some new proprietary magic up their sleeves but everything I&#x27;ve seen from them so far is just a showy wrapper around really basic math.",1405897136

8061814,comment,8061502,8061502,1,0,jordonwii,,,"In the summer prior to my last year of middle school (~2007), I came up with an idea for a website: a restricted and local social-networking site for young students (my peers, essentially). I spent that summer reading Head First HTML/CSS (a fantastic book, if a bit dated by now), and a book on Javascript. I taught myself PHP, SQL, and Python/Django, also, over the course of that year.<p>That site was never really finished, as by the time I hit high school, almost everyone was using Facebook, and my idea seemed redundant. However, through high school, I kept up on a number of side projects (mostly in Python, and Django where appropriate), and also participated in Google&#x27;s Code-In (a great experience for a high school student who&#x27;d never contributed to anything with more than a few users, so far. Would definitely recommend to anyone at that age interested in CS). That was my first &quot;paycheck&quot;, but it hardly counts, as it was only ~$200, made from an organized competition. One of my side projects was a Chrome app that I sold for $5 each, and I made a couple hundred dollars off of that, too.<p>I got my first real job (part-time) when I moved to the Bay Area to go to college studying CS. Conveniently, a startup just off of the campus was looking for a Python/Django dev, and the skills I&#x27;d acquired on my own doing side projects were enough that I could dive into a moderately large codebase with a good idea of what was going on (and this was before I&#x27;d even started classes). I&#x27;m still with that startup now.<p>So, the timeline went something like this:\n~2007: taught myself basic programming.\n2009-2010: made some money in Google Code-In and selling an app.\n2013: went to college, got employed at a startup.",1405896894
8061813,comment,8060156,8061639,2,0,smutticus,,,"If you don&#x27;t want to trust DNS then don&#x27;t trust DNS. All DNSSEC does is verify that the reponse you get from a DNS server is the response the domain owner wanted you to receive.<p>It&#x27;s also a bit of a stretch to say that DNS is controlled by governments. I don&#x27;t even know how to unpack that statement as it seems overly broad and unnuanced. When the USG wants to seize a domain they can seize a domain. DNSSEC has nothing to do with that. The USG seizes domains now, and they&#x27;ll most likely seize domains if DNSSEC reaches full deployment. Whether or not DNSSEC is deployed is entirely irrelevant to any seizure of domain names by any government.<p>I&#x27;m all for working on non-hierarchical naming systems for the Internet, but DNS is already rooted in hierarchy. We might as well have a hierarchy we can trust, so why not DNSSEC?",1405896807

I didn&#x27;t have any experience in the area, but I had always had a knack for computers. However, after nine months of job hunting, I was ready to take anything remotely computer related and ended up accepting a position as a customer service rep/QA tester at a small (4-6 employees) web development agency.<p>My boss gave me a lot of freedom, so when I wasn&#x27;t tied up with customer support or testing I worked on speeding up processes that were extremely tedious and/or time consuming. This agency had been around for more than a decade at this point, so there were a lot of things we did a certain way just because &quot;that&#x27;s how we&#x27;ve always done it.&quot; For example, at the end of each month we would review the hours logged against various client projects and create invoices manually. This process generally took several days because we would print out hard copies of all the time entries and mark up the sheets with pens and highlighters, then transfer that back to Word documents to be printed and sent to the client. By writing a little code and moving to an Excel spreadsheet for reviewing the logged hours, I was able to cut the time down from several days to &quot;just&quot; 3-4 hours. It was like magic!<p>I continued doing this kind of work in my free time until one of our developers left for another company. I expressed interest in moving to a development position and got the job. At this point, I had been with the company for about six months. I honed my skills for a while and got involved with some OSS communities and started a blog, both of which served to really help me grow as a developer. About a year and a half after moving into the development position, I moved on to the company I&#x27;m with now. I&#x27;m still doing web development, but not at an agency - I work primarily on internal tools and processes for a company.",1405896130

Very often you can prove statements about relationships among solutions to an equation (e.g. they may form a linear or affine space). You could then use the original experimental solution to generate further solutions using numerically tractable transformations.",1405895772

Vikram Villager gets more Vikram-utility out of a few more dollars of income than he would out of keeping his lobster. No mainstream utility theorist would claim to quantitively compare Yolanda-utility to Vikram-utility.<p>Edit/Clarification: the essence of social welfare economics is in trying to do interpersonal utility comparisons that yield a social utility function that behaves as much as possible like a personal utility function.

You&#x27;re European, and I think you may have an overly inflated concept of what a DMCA notice is, hopefully this will help.<p>The DMCA, or digital Millennium copyright Act, was a poorly written overhaul of US copyright law. It included some smart things, like &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions for companies that simply provide a place where users can share content. These companies aren&#x27;t actually copyright infringers under the DMCA, but in exchange for not being liable for user content, they have to comply in a timely manner with a complaint about copyright infringement. The complaint is in the form of a DMCA notice, or DMCA complaint.<p>A DMCA notice is simply a form that someone fills out and gives to a host complaining about something being hosted that was created by a third party. I record a TV show, put it on YouTube, the owner of the TV show sends a DMCA complaint to Youtube, Youtube suspends my video.<p>There are no judges, administrators, or even legal professionals involved (although the parties involved may use lawyers to create and reply to DMCA complaints). There is no government office involved, no DMCA institution. You or I could go to Youtube and fill out the DMCA complaint form against a specific video.<p>And there in lies your problem; any jerk can MAKE a DMCA complaint, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be true, there&#x27;s no prof required at this point. And the way DMCA noticed work, your stuff gets pulled. That&#x27;s how the rules work, they complain, the host pulls it and notifies you, then you are granted the opportunity to respond. The good news is, the was the DMCA says it&#x27;s supposed to work is that if you respond that the DMCA claim is false, then the content is supposed to be put back up fairly quickly.<p>I had someone incorrectly make a DMCA claim against a video I had on Youtube. the video came down, I replied that it was fair use, and the video went right back up, and no one has complained since.<p>This guy is going to make a DMCA claim, and you&#x27;ll have to simply respond that he&#x27;s wrong, and your content will go back up. If he insists he&#x27;s still right, then he has to sue you, and THEN he has to show prof, and since he can&#x27;t, he&#x27;ll never sue you.<p>However, if he makes a bogus DMCA claim, you can sue him. <a href=""http://targetlaw.com/consequences-of-filing-a-false-dmca-takedown-request"" rel=""nofollow"">http://targetlaw.com/consequences-of-filing-a-false-dmca-tak...</a>",1405895346

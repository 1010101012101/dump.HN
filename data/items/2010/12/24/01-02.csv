I stumbled across it earlyish, so I was pretty involved in meta-Wikipedia stuff (mailing lists, Arbitration Committee, etc.) circa 2003-06, when the barrier to entry and formality was low.<p>Now, researching & writing articles on moderately-important-to-obscure historical subjects is something I do as an odd form of relaxation. I occasionally edit articles in my actual area of expertise, but that feels more like ""work"". Collecting a few sources to write a decent first cut at an article on a historical figure or event feels like recreation. Plus, I learn some things.<p>There'a also <i>very</i> little controversy and conflict compared to writing about hot topics and recent events, so not much wikidrama.

That is part of the reason why things ""just work"" when you move that process to another machine, or data centre. If the implementation can be smart and ""cheat"" by sharing data in the same process that's fine, but it is an implementation detail and not a property of the system.<p>The way Erlang works is that you have a single event loop and threads are spawned to handle i/o and such (the n:m threading model, N green threads are mapped onto M OS threads). When a process blocks its execution is suspended.<p>Node employs an n:m threading model as well except ""processes"" in node are just functions. One big difference is that if you make a blocking call in node the whole process is blocked. There's only an event loop, no scheduler or anything that OS-like involved. The Erlang model is clearly superior imo, but Node is <i>far</i> more accessible (for better and worse).",1293154902

Thus issuing a count command repeatedly on a 100k doc collection will see the count bounce up as it shards. 100k, 106k, 100k, 104k etc. This is not a problem for lookups of single documents but means any row scans will produce inconsistent values if the collection is re-balancing.

It seems arrogant and presumptuous to claim the number one spot for a hypothetical threat that one happens to be deeply involved with.<p>Debating the likelihood of recursively self-improving AI is tedious, usually pointless, and often goes the way of political and religious debate, which could hint at its inclusion in the participants' self definition [1], and I don't have the time or energy to get involved right now.<p>I apologize if I came off as dismissive -- I was frusterated over my initial point. If it matters to you, I certainly haven't completely written off recursively self-improving AI. I just find it extremely unlikely in the near-to-mid future, and think there are other more pressing issues that have the distinction of currently existing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a>",1274327983

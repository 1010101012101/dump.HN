From an interview Eno gave (found on his Wikipedia page):<p>""The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, ""Here's a specific problem X solve it."" The thing from the agency said, ""We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,"" this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said ""and it must be 3 3/4 seconds long."" I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel. In fact, I made 84 pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.""\n",1193003983

Yep, he means software testing.  <p>I guess it's good news for us startup founders that Google has an infestation of Agilists, burrowing into the company with their sharp little teeth.

70963,story,,,6,18,myoung8,"Ask YC: Is it a bad idea to...?",,"Is it a bad idea to build a product where the distribution model relies heavily on sales?<p>Here's the problem: our product fulfills a big need (not a want) for a certain group of individual consumers. However, they're not part of the TC50K and it won't be easy to get the word out to them. What we're thinking about doing instead is selling the product to HR departments in big companies (a few of our competitors are already doing this). There's a lot more money there, but the product doesn't fill as big a need anymore and selling to the enterprise seems a lot harder than selling to individual customers.<p>Any suggestions? Thanks.",1193001585

This would allow you to stay with a specific version of a library and less dependent on the whims of the distro staff.<p>- You also have the option of using a cluster of compilers to compile the packages, though you may not want your production machines to be a part of the cluster. <p>- You have control over the CPU optimization flags.<p>- You have control over package features. This is the equivalent of turning them on or off with ./configure --enable-xxxx, but it is abstracted away into USE flags. <p>- Each package is downloaded from upstream, sometimes with Gentoo-specific patches applied to them. In otherwords, you have access to pristine sources as the authors intended.<p>- You can also define an ""overlay"" so you can write your own custom ebuilds, should you have specific patches you want to apply to any or all of the packages<p>- You can use the overlay to do an internal release of your proprietary software using Portage. You can define package dependencies with your proprietary software.<p>It is a lot more work than setting up a Debian or an Ubuntu box, but you also get more control. \n",1193001009

With an imaged LAMP, I can copy and scale very easily. I guess I'd rather have 20 boxes whose CPUs were only the doing the few things I care about than all the other stuff that goes with Windows -- patches, updates, Active Directory, Kerebos, etc.<p>\nBut no, I'm not ruling WAMP out. I was curious to see what kind of learning curve we're talking about moving from a windows to a LAMP environment. A couple of months ago, I downloaded a LAMP vritual appliance, but didn't have a good grasp on how to do even some very simple things.",1193000583

70956,comment,70855,70954,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"What is interesting is that it seems that there was a person or persons who developed the traditional Japanese style including modularity, scale proportional to humans, space usage flexibility, about 1000 years ago.  That style was copied again and again.  There are also many non-integrative contemporary buildings that do not try to imitate a style, so I'm still not unconvinced about this - but again this is clearly a pretty big generalization without any significant research, but something to think about.\n",1193000541

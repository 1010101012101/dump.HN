My iPad Mini, iPhone 5, Mac Pro, Apple TV and MBP are all more than adequate.  Making them gold or shaving off a few ounces isn&#x27;t very exciting.<p>The iPad was released less than 3 years after the iPhone.  Now we&#x27;re three years past the release of the iPad with nothing new to talk about.  I&#x27;m sure there are exciting things happening under the hood at Apple, but the event was a bit boring.<p>Apple should also rethink their television ads.  The style they popularized has become trite and they ooze with self-importance.  The iPad mini video with the pencil reminded me of Facebook&#x27;s terrible Chair ad.

But as a currency, it <i>does</i> need to &quot;settle down.&quot; Think about it from the perspective of a business intending to transact in Bitcoin and prepare for the years ahead. Inventory management, logistics, financial planning, and all the other necessities of running a business as a going concern are extraordinarily difficult when the currency one accepts is fluctuating this wildly.<p>Exchanges, such as the late Silk Road, do not hold their own inventory, and so those types of businesses make some degree of sense. (Even still, they&#x27;d have a very hard time attracting investment, if they ever sought it, because the company&#x27;s fundamental financial position would change on a daily basis.)<p>But businesses other than open exchanges face some very serious difficulties when conducting business in BTC. This is one major source of the liquidity issue. The other is that speculative holders and traders far outweigh transactors in terms of the currency&#x27;s total trading volume. BTC changes hands quite often, but not typically in the form of business transactions, which one would expect of a currency. Far more often it&#x27;s in the form of buy and sell orders, like a commodity.",1382644714

They give them special bells and whistles the user created content doesn&#x27;t have. They let them animate, float over content or auto play video or sound.<p>Why? Because it makes the product a little better for the customers: the advertisers. Instagram, just like their Facebook overlords, are now in the business of making their product as good as it can be for the advertisers while keeping the users just happy enough not to leave.<p>I really dislike this cycle in the startup world.

My takeaway is that this isn&#x27;t something I personally would get involved in.<p>First and foremost because I have a preference for starting my own projects independently as opposed to signing on with Assembly; for a number of reasons, chief among them is arguably personal preference and perhaps a bit of an entrepreneurial streak. I also think there&#x27;s a potentiality, as open source continues to grow in popularity, for corporate-funded projects to be more alluring given that they provide a steady paycheck and benefits if you work for the company. For example, I work on an open source project which was initially an internal project developed for my employer and later released to the public. Today we maintain the codebase and in a sense I am paid to do that particular bit of open source work (I don&#x27;t exclusively work on that, of course). Maybe this isn&#x27;t a fair comparison, but I wouldn&#x27;t give up my day job, which affords some of the benefits Assembly is ostensibly offering (get paid to do open source), or exchange the free time I spend on my own projects for this kind of stake sharing in a project or product...at least not yet.<p>On the other hand, this might be exactly what some people are looking to do in their free time: maybe you don&#x27;t want to start your own company or you want to spend time in open source but prefer to get paid for it and your employer has no intention of helping you scratch that itch. However, given that last comment in particular, I really wonder if money is the proper motivating factor for so much of what the community has come to mean? Certainly the prestige of working on a popular or important project has historically been far more valuable than monetary compensation (and can even lead to monetary compensation these days, if a savvy employer is involved and happens to notice you&#x27;re a Linux kernel committer or some such).<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea, that I&#x27;m sure of and I&#x27;m wishing these guys the best of luck with it! While I may not be their target audience, it does seem like there could be something here. So here&#x27;s to hoping it develops into something awesome.",1382642480

We&#x27;re really familiar with the science of matching wavelengths of sound (like music notes, making chords when wavelengths work in harmony, and the idea of a measured scale of tones from low to high.<p>Some musicians can &#x27;play by ear&#x27;, and likewise some artists and designers just rely on their gut to pick wavelengths that &#x27;feel&#x27; right together.

6607243,comment,6602674,6602674,2,0,johnzdennis,,,"Hi everybody, designer here.  I really appreciate all the feedback; this concept is still in its infancy and can obviously use quite a bit of improvement, but I&#x27;m trying to tweak it as best I can to maximize its usability.<p>Couple of notes:\n1. The ultimate intention is to either pull images (both satellite and decoy) from the web as they are needed or create a database of images and update it regularly.  Thus identifying images as real or decoy will only work on a short-term basis; there will always be new images entering the fold.<p>2. If people like this concept well enough to keep at it, I&#x27;m planning to automate some kind of color-matching scheme so that it&#x27;s not possible to just look at the histograms of the images and identify the satellite images thusly.<p>3. I&#x27;m only just starting to learn about OCR, so at this moment I have no idea whether it&#x27;s worth bothering to disguise letters or even whether it&#x27;s worth using letters at all.  I prefer having a two-tiered approach; having to ID a satellite image AND identify characters.  If the bots are too good at identifying the characters and/or it&#x27;s too hard for humans, that just leaves the satellite question and from what I&#x27;ve read that&#x27;s not a high enough level of entropy.<p>4. I don&#x27;t have anything lined up for an audio solution just yet.  I&#x27;m fooling around with a few concepts, but nothing worth mentioning just yet.<p>5.

For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline&#x27;s homepage when the airline&#x27;s name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.</i><p><a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a><p>The main difference seems to be that today even getting the top organic search result doesn&#x27;t provide enough clicks for advertisers, so they feel obliged to purchase ads for their own brand names even when they already rank first.

I taught myself programming in 7th grade because I really wanted to play Sim City, but having no gaming computers/consoles, I couldn&#x27;t. However, I did have a programmable calculator for my math class.<p>I spent all of middle school and high school programming my own games on this underpowered (a few mhz of CPU and a few kb of memory), inconvenient (typing thousands of lines of code on this tiny keyboard is a feat) device (and yes, I did make a turn-by-turn Sim City for the TI-82). While I was doing this, a lot of my friends were playing Warcraft 3, The Sims, and watching dumb TV shows (early to mid 2000s, reality TV was just becoming big in France).<p>Similarly, my girlfriend&#x27;s parents were very anti-TV etc. As a result, she spent her childhood and teenage years drawing, and eventually she went to a top art school (RISD) and now makes a living from her illustration and teaching art.<p>I&#x27;m not sure who I would be if I had grown up with an iPad and a playstation, or who my girlfriend would be if her parents had let her watch TV; no one can tell. However, I think our situations worked out really well for us; and when I have kids/teenagers (not for another decade or so), I will most definitely give them a life analog to what I experienced rather than a media-consumption heavy one. For instance, I haven&#x27;t had TV ever since I moved out of my parent&#x27;s house (I do have a projector for watching movies from the computer), and intend to keep it that way.<p>I obviously have a fairly tech heavy life right now, as a tech worker in SF, but I am trying to cut down. I am noticing that I whip out my phone every time I have a spare 30 seconds, I have several laptops and iPads laying around the house, etc. - and I like it less and less. I&#x27;m slowly selling away my excess devices, and am thinking of getting rid of my iPhone when my contract runs out (and just get a dumbphone as a replacement for emergencies). I bought a really cheap netbook, installed archlinux+xmonad on it, and am using it as my primary machine at home for web browsing + programming + LaTeX. It&#x27;s harder to get distracted with this machine.<p>In 2011, Tom Preston-Werner said the only hardware he had at home were a waffle maker, a microwave and a bike[0]- I like that mentality.<p>19 year old me would have pre-ordered a Google Glass from day one and used it with religious fervor; now, I am absolutely not interested in such a device, as I know it is just the ad billboard of the 21st century manufactured by Google.<p>I still have a few guilty digital pleasures; for example, I buy a lot of used video games that I wanted to play in my childhood and never could (mostly Game Boy Advance/Game Cube- the upside is that you can get 20 of those games used on Amazon for the price of 3 new current-gen games).<p>My hope is that over the next few months and years, I will revert to reading as much as I used to, and spend less time on Facebook/Twitter/etc. (HN is not completely in that bucket, as it leads me to write introspective comments like this, which I think is good). I think a big part of it is removing the devices that will <i>call</i> for your attention. My Game Boy Advance or MP3 player will never call for my attention- it just waits for me to use it. However, my iPad or iPhone will call for my attention every few minutes, which is not liberating at all. Tech should be liberating.<p>YMMV :)<p>[0]: <a href=""http://tom.preston-werner.usesthis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tom.preston-werner.usesthis.com</a>",1382641606

6607205,comment,6605500,6605500,6,0,ianstormtaylor,,,"Love the idea for the tool, and happy to see it support Javascript. Some feedback:<p>- Let open-source projects still live under an account, instead of being weirdly separated. Just oauth with Github and automatically lint all of my repos. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t mind getting an email for all of them. You&#x27;re making way more work for yourself by splitting open-source vs. private, when I don&#x27;t think you gain much. Companies will still have to use the private system. Look at Travis for a better example of how to do this. This is critical to me using the product, I don&#x27;t want to have to remember the link to these things every time.<p>- Call it &quot;open-source&quot; not &quot;OSS&quot;. Unnecessary abbreviations are confusing. I don&#x27;t ever refer to it as &quot;OSS&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure the people who do still understand &quot;open-source&quot;.<p>- The other benefit to letting me actually have an account for open-source things is that I don&#x27;t have to see the annoying marketing bar all the time when visiting my own repo.<p>- Even though that solves the marketing bar, get rid of the marketing bar. It&#x27;s by far my most hated &quot;feature&quot; of most sites, and I would feel pretty comfortable saying that since your target audience is developers most of them probably aren&#x27;t fans.<p>- The other benefit is that the ignoring patterns don&#x27;t need to be migrated over, they&#x27;re just there. (You&#x27;ll see this pattern a lot, because separating open-source out is a bad abstraction in your app&#x27;s design, so it will lead to tons of other random problems and extra work. I&#x27;m literally doing this right now for Segment.io -- moving from &quot;projects&quot; that exist by themselves to &quot;users&quot; and &quot;organizations&quot; that contain them.)<p>- Have an option not to lint. The linter options are really strict, I use a very lax version of JSHint in Sublime, but I don&#x27;t use .jshintrc because I don&#x27;t want extra bloat files in my repos.<p>- It seems like every time I want to add a new open-source repo I have to navigate to the pricing page a click a tiny link... (If I&#x27;m actually able to have an account for open-source projects, that wasn&#x27;t clear at all from the landing page, it looks like signing up is only if I want to pay for a private team account.)<p>- Add a link to your homepage on your blog. (The old classic.)<p>- Don&#x27;t make your min-width so wide. I mean I&#x27;m a dev with a huge monitor and still I had to open up my window to not feel claustrophobic. No page in your app needs to require that much space. Cutting off source at ~80 characters is perfectly fine. (Actually, lots of your internal pages could benefit from having less space instead.)<p>- Make your climate badge look nicer. Travis&#x27;s badges are disgusting, so no need to copy them exactly ;) (Retina would be nice!)<p>- If the &quot;view on github&quot; button is important (I think it is) then make it look important. I had no idea what it did until  clicked it because the icon doesn&#x27;t communicate much. (Plus that &quot;g&quot; is from their old wordmark.)<p>- The search by class name, badge and tweet button are all different sizes so they feel very awkward next to each other.<p>- The site is really slow. It takes ~5 seconds to navigate from the feed page to an individual file by pressing the graph. And around 1 second to &quot;view more&quot; on the snippets of code. Generally this just makes me frustrated and less happy to use the product. (The importance of this is often underrated, I know because our own dashboard has this exact problem.)<p>- Come up with a layout that doesn&#x27;t need to have the repo name overflow with ellipsis. That&#x27;s pretty much one of the most important pieces of text on the page, so it&#x27;s not okay to truncate it.<p>- Get a yellow with more orange in it for &quot;C&quot;. Then it would be possible to still use a white letter. This way your highcharts graphs don&#x27;t break since the labels are all white there.<p>- Be more consistent with your color scheme. The greens and yellows on the tour page aren&#x27;t the same as the in the grading. And they&#x27;re also different from the colors in the source view. And they&#x27;re different from the colors in pricing?<p>- Heyo! Just found the &quot;Solo Plan&quot;, op, nope that doesn&#x27;t solve my problem nevermind.<p>- There&#x27;s probably a more understandable way to organize the table of files by the way they are nested in the codebase. you might want a sort of Github file navigator instead. Or at least files that are in the same folder shouldn&#x27;t be bisected by files that aren&#x27;t.<p>- I have no idea what the complexity numbers mean. Or the duplication numbers (is that lines of code duplicated?) Or  the churn numbers. Or what &quot;C/M&quot; means. Or the smell numbers. Or why smell is a category, since aren&#x27;t all of these code smell? Should it be lint instead?<p>- Having a file navigator would eliminate the need for paging the files. (Really strongly suggest a file navigator because it will feel very nice to browse the same way as on Github. I don&#x27;t need to see every single file up front. I can just browser through my repo like normal. And then the bad ones are called out on the feed page.<p>- The refresh button is also confusing, why is the commit shown? (I know why now, but in its current state it&#x27;s un-obvious, slash ugly.)<p>- Don&#x27;t abbreviate &quot;Complexity per Method&quot; to &quot;Complexity / M&quot; just to then have a tooltip on hover that says &quot;Complexity per Method&quot;.<p>- Lines of code count seems broken. Lines of code per method also just shows exactly the same as LOC, which also seems broken. Same with method count. (for <a href=""https://codeclimate.com/github/segmentio/analytics.js/lib/integrations/spinnakr.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codeclimate.com/github/segmentio/analytics.js/lib/in...</a>)<p>- Breakdown over time graph is probably better visualized as a percentage-based stacked area plot.<p>- Churn vs. quality seems pretty useless to me. Can&#x27;t think of why that will help.<p>- GPA is a really bad metric. My co-founder asked (is a low GPA good? because the connection to school GPA isn&#x27;t clear) Just give me an overall grade like &quot;D&quot; for the repo instead. You can still plot the real number over time but I don&#x27;t need to know about it.<p>Hope some of that helps! The product seems very promising.

I had a bit of an epiphany about the state of desktop Windows a few years ago when for a hobby project I wrote a UI using only Win32 and C and no external dependencies.  Maybe it took longer to write than it should have but I was really shocked at how the thing ran so much faster and smoother than just about any UI I was using on that machine.  It dawned on me that all those layers of MFC, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, WinRT and whatever else they&#x27;ll come up with in the name of developer productivity are no match for a set of APIs designed to run at 25MHz with 8MB of RAM.",1382641444

6607190,comment,6606056,6606948,4,0,claudius,,,"> 1. Instant on. I can keep my thoughts in tact and act on them immediately. No booting, no memory lags, no millions of tabs open in a browser.<p>Suspend to RAM, 8 GB of RAM and as many tabs open as I like (usually none, but Opera appears to handle 100s quite well, too). You must be using PCs wrong.<p>> 2. Focus. Desktop interfaces seem to be desperate to put everything onto one screen. I have a PC and a Mac (both laptops). I prefer the PC to the Mac; better memory management for photoshop and browsing, and I love Snap. But that&#x27;s where the usefulness stops. With an ipad, I have no distractions on the screen.<p>I also have no distractions on the screen if I don’t want them. You must be using PCs wrong.<p>> 3. \\…] The iPad Mini is better than the bigger variants. […] I don&#x27;t need a big screen for a PC because the resolution isn&#x27;t better than an ipad and I&#x27;m using it solo. Google Glass could quite possibly be the next advancement in this theme.<p>The iPad mini has a resolution of 1024x768, roughly the same as my X41. If your current PC doesn’t have a higher resolution, you must be using PCs wrong – I expect at least 1200 pixels vertically and 1400 horizontally if I am expected to do any work at this thing. 900 vertically might be enough for casual browsing, but it does feel inferior.<p>> 4. Build quality. PCs look and feel cheap. Including my beloved Sony Vaio Z. The ipad in my hand could never be criticised for build quality.<p>I tend to be very wary around Apple hardware, seeing how people put them into protective sleeves, pockets and all other assortments of stuff. I don’t think a tablet would survive the things my T410s survived.<p>> 5. Price. The ipad doesn&#x27;t do more than 10% of what I need to do. But, I do those 10% of things 90% of the time. So why pay more for a PC when the ipad has no performance issues and takes care of me 90% of the time.<p>I won’t argue about performance issues (the iPad lacks the software to even test performance properly…) and at least I pay for a PC because I want 100%, not 90%, of the job done.<p>> 6. Always connected. It strikes me as absurd seeing laptops on the trains with dongles sticking out. It takes ages for those dongles to boot up. I used to spend 5-10 minutes of a train journey waiting for the laptop to be ready. My ipad mini with LTE is ever ready. And cheaper. And built better. And more fun.<p>Time from button press to xscreensaver unlock window: 2s. Time to get LTE modem ready: 5s. Time to open 100s of tabs in Opera and decrypt email locally and do all other things I could possibly want to do: nearly instantaneously. With an iPad mini (which would most likely break in my backpack on the way to the train), I couldn’t even do half of these things – it admittedly might be cheaper, though, but 1600 € every four-or-so years vs. 480 € what appears like every year are roughly equivalent, wouldn’t you say?<p>As I said, if you settle with inferior stuff and use PCs as absurdly as described by you, I can see why you like tablets more.",1382641359

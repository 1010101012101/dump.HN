In 1066, the Normans conquered England, bringing French which became the official and court language of England for several centuries.<p>Old English and Old High German being ""basically the same language"" is a very ignorant thing to say and categorically wrong. Old High German might have been much more close to Old English than modern standard German is to English but they weren't mutually intelligible and they were clearly different languages even at that time. Major differences between the two had arisen many centuries earlier. Take for example the High German consonant shift. Now, would you please explain why you would say that both were ""basically the same language""?",1313956711

2910110,comment,2909136,2909787,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"> knowing a second natural language does give you a new perspective on your first<p>I agree with that, however I disagree that having a different perspective on English makes me a better English speaker. Writer -- perhaps -- but still nothing that a smart native English speaker who spent some time in school reading Shakespeare and the classics could not beat.<p>> If you don't feel knowing a second language is helping you use your first, maybe you need to look more closely at how you use both.<p>I can speak English, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, and French. The last two are a bit rusty but I bet I could catch up pretty quickly if I had to. The problem is that, while I speak and write English very well, I possess no ""secret power"" that would let me beat native speakers of English. Proof: nearly all great writers who wrote in English (or any other language) were native speakers. Knowing the ways of Lisp gives a C programmer a ""secret power"" which he or she can apply even to the procedural language that is C. Knowing the ways of Russian or French gives me no such advantage with English (except obviously for the occasional French phrase or word root -- but those advantages are insignificant compared to the tremendous advantage of being a native speaker).",1313956665

After all, in years not too long ago we managed to live just fine without cell phones or even personal computers (of any kind).<p>The thing that most people missed before the iPad was they didn't understand what its purpose was (myself included, although I was neutral on the device rather than negative). You pick one up though and it's simply a joy to use. There's no booting it up, battery life is great, it's sufficient for Web browsing, reading email and generally consuming various sources of information. Updates are a breeze (of both the OS and apps). The payment ecosystem is built in.<p>The iPad is for me the most used gadget I think I've ever bought. For the foreseeable future I think it's easily justifiable (for me, having sufficient disposable income) to buy the new model every year. Not because I need it (I have the iPad 2 and could easily have lived with the iPad 1 for another year).<p>But it's simply a joy to use.<p>Apple has a great history now of taking things that suck and making them great. Using computers, generally speaking, sucks. Updating tends to be awkward and haphazard. You end up wasting huge amounts of time solving arcane problems (on Windows and even more so on Linux).<p>In years passed I used to like buying PC parts, assembling a PC, installing the OS and so on. Now? I just can't be bothered. I'm happy to pay a premium to someone (which only seems to be Apple these days) to solve these problems for me.

2910084,comment,2908850,2909569,1,0,exDM69,,,"There are several examples where something like this has gone horribly wrong. High level API's for ""common use cases"" tend to work only for writing one page examples for text books but are completely useless for anything more serious. One example of this is the CUDA API. They have a low level C API, which gives you a good but a little verbose programming API (because GPGPU is complicated). Then there's a high level API where you write the GPU code mixed together with the CPU C++ code. It somewhat worked for the examples in the Cuda manual but was useless for anything else.<p>OpenGL did have a library called GLU that did some high level things such as quadrics (for spheres, cylinders, etc) and tesselation of polygons. It was completely written on the CPU on top of OpenGL. It worked decently for some stuff. Direct3D has also some helpers, f.ex. to do some matrix math and load 3d models.<p>A library like OpenGL is probably best left to be a low level API for a low level task.

Just compare the OpenGL API to the Direct3D API and you should see a clear difference.<p>The best (or worst) example of this is the OpenGL context, which is basically a global (actually: thread local) variable that tells which GL context and window should be drawn to. This context then stores a bunch of other global state, such as texture bindings.<p>The API was (probably) designed like this because in the early 1990's it was actually a major optimization to avoid pushing parameters to the stack when calling functions several times a frame. Many graphics API's of that era did the same thing. Also there usually was only one screen with one fullscreen ""window"", so why not make the ""display"" a global variable? Now 20 years later we are stuck with this shit because it became an industry standard.<p>OpenGL is a pain in the ass, not only for programmers but the implementors of the API. For example, take a look at OpenGL ""texture completeness"" rules (textures must have consistent mipmap levels, etc). Direct3D does not have an equivalent, because the API is designed so that all textures are always complete.<p>Unfortunately we seem to be stuck with OpenGL for a while. There's not much interest for redesigning the API and as far as I can tell (I'm a Khronos member), no ongoing effort to do so. Direct3D is a much better API but unfortunately it supports a very limited number of platforms (none of which I actually like to use).",1313955645

2910033,comment,2909136,2909136,27,0,cletus,,,"I'm a native English speaker. I studied a little French and speak (and can read/write) some German (with limited vocabulary). For the English speaker, German grammar is painful enough (3 genders, agreement of nouns and adjectives by case, number and article, separable verbs, etc) but, based on what reading I've done, German is still ""Latin lite"".<p>A friend of mine (also native English speaker) lives in Taiwan and has learnt traditional Chinese (rather than simplified, as is now taught and used in China). The character memorization, to me at least, is horrifying. But the grammar is fairly simple (apart from tonal variation in words).<p>The evolution of languages (linguistics I guess) interests me greatly so first up, thanks for the post.<p>With all these different language systems, one has to wonder how they evolve.<p>Several events in history are of particular interest.<p>The first is what happened to English. English in the 10th century was basically the same language as German (Althochdeutsch or Old High German, to be precise). In 1066, the Normans conquered England, bringing French which became the official and court language of England for several centuries.<p>This had several important effects:<p>Firstly, many words migrated to English from French and Latin (although there were Latin words previously). Often the English form was ""low brow"" whereas the Latin/French version were ""high brow"".<p>Secondly, without a central authority enforcing a language standard, the language evolved hugely. Old English for Modern English speakers is basically unreadable. Middle English is mostly comprehensible. This was a massive change.<p>Along the way, English basically lost the concept of case (apart from pronouns), gender (again, apart from pronouns) and word agreement. Grammar was also greatly simplified (almost everything in English is done on word position rather than word ending like most Indo-European languages).<p>The TL:DR version of this is that there is a reasonable case to be made that a central authority actually stifles language ""innovation"". If true, one could argue that how arbitrary (rather than regular) a language is is a measure of the state control over that language during its history.<p>I don't presume to argue that this is true but it's an interesting idea.<p>The second interesting historical event was the switch in 1929 from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin alphabet for Turkish, which had a massive increase in literacy in the following years (since the alphabet is simple and phonetic).<p>The third interesting event is the rise of computers. I would argue that is was almost <i>inevitable</i> that this would happen in a country with either the Latin or Cyrilic alphabets. The reasons are:<p>1. Limited number of characters (think: keyboards and character sets); and<p>2. Limited variation in those characters (in English: uppercase and lowercase). Compare that to Arabic.<p>IMHO (1) is incredibly important. In Mandarin, if I want to tell you a new character I have to show you. There is no way to describe it. In English, a new word can be communicate verbally. I don't think you can overstate how important this distinction is.<p>Asian computer use has evolved a number of schemes to get around these issues, such as character combinations to represent certain characters (which, again, you have to learn) and, more recently, the use of graphics pads to draw characters.<p>The last thing I wanted to mention was this paper [1], which shows a mathematical relationship between languages becoming regular and the frequency with which words are used (the more a word is used, the longer it takes to become regular).<p>Anyway, enough rambling on my part.<p>[1[: <a href=""http://www.physorg.com/news111241495.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physorg.com/news111241495.html</a>",1313955539

2909985,comment,2909144,2909822,3,0,radiowave,,,"Not much of a comparison, but JTalk aims for code compatibility with Pharo Smalltalk, whereas Clamato is a distinct dialect. Perhaps partly because of this, I felt able to work with immediately in a way I never did with Clamato, or any other in-browser Smalltalk-like software I've seen. My past experience with Smalltalk transfers well into JTalk, not so well into Clamato.<p>When I first ran JTalk (months back), one of the expressions I tried was to get the sum of even numbers between 1 and 5, and it doesn't work, because JTalk is missing various things, like 'even' and 'odd'. I had a Pharo Smalltalk system to hand, and was able to look up the implementation for 'even', and deeper requirements like '//' (divide without remainder), and type them into the browser until I got the answer.<p>Since then, JTalk now has the very beginnings of exception handling. When Smalltalk is asked to evaluate a non-existent method, it raises a MessageNotUnderstood (MNU) exception. It's interesting to think about the idea of having a web service running on Pharo, which answer chunks of it's own source code, and JTalk's MNU behaviour being to send out an http request to try to load that source code, and then continue running. (I don't know nearly enough about Javascript or JTalk internals - this may be wildly impractical.)<p>In any case, the idea of code compatibility between front-end and back-end is very appealing: re-use domain model classes, write input validation in one place and have it run in both places, and such.<p>(I seem to have gone off on a tangent.

Learning any language well is mind-bending for any speaker of another language. It does help if the languages are different (I remember very vividly the <i>click</i> that went in my head in high school when I was taking English, Chinese and Hebrew simultaneously... that's how I ended up in linguistics grad school), but different people have their minds bent by completely different things. I mean, root-and-pattern morphology is really cool when it's that regular, but if you think of it it's not horribly different from Germanic strong verbs (write-wrote-written). Weird agreement patterns? Well, Welsh only uses the 3pl verb forms with a pronominal subject, so ""they they-went"" but ""people he-went"" (as, for that matter, do some varieties of English). And so on.<p>I mean, sure, whatever floats your boat, and it's awesome that studying Arabic can be so fulfilling; I've had the same experience with Welsh. But at the end of the day <i>all</i> languages bend your mind, and I don't think there can be an objective metric. They are just hard.",1313953699

2909925,comment,2908208,2909078,1,0,vu0tran,,,"I want stock because I know the work I""m doing is adding tremendous value to the company. I also know that right now, I am underpaid. I do more than 40 hours a week and what to do more than 40 hours a week. I want that work to translate to something and ultimately, I feel that this company is in the position to take off. It was featured in Inc. 500 as one of the top startups in the industry.<p>Here's a little more of a background with where I'm at:<p>I was initially signed on as a contractor (startup obviously). My contract was for 9 months and there were 4 other devs there at the time including me.<p>Within a month, one of the devs changed workplaces because he got a better offer. After that, they took the initiative to sign me on full time as a ""senior level"" developer for 75k. I was expecting more of a 85-90k range, however, this was the start of the summer months and the work coming in is drastically reduced.<p>I approached the general manager anyways and pointed out that 85k-90k is where I want to be, but I am willing to be patient through summer. The feedback I got from him was that I was too ""naive"" the way I approached this and sounded too ""greedy"" and ""arrogant"". Big blow to my ego. I resolved that I would just work tremendously hard and prove my value otherwise.<p>Within another 3 months, another developer left, and the technical director left as well. Due to better opportunities or they just didn't get along with the people there anymore.<p>This leaves me in the position of doing all of their work, including the job of the Technical Director. Generating business strategy, implementing new technologies, overseeing research/development etc.<p>I had a chat with the general manager and my boss about a week ago. This was a midyear review. They raised my salary to 80k, but didn't really talk to much about whether I'd be the new Technical Director or not, but just deferred to December.<p>Unlike with the general manager, I have a pretty good work relationship with my boss so I gave him a call that night and asked him what's up. He told me that he was trying to push the general manager to increase my pay to 100k and push me to Technical Director right now given that my responsibilities to change. However, the general manager pushed back and said that this ""wouldn't be fair"" to the rest of the team as I was the only one that got a midyear review.<p>I'm grateful of my boss. He definitely understands me. However, because he's not a technical guy (nor anyone else at the company), he doesn't understand the grasp of how much I'm doing for the company, and more importantly, how much devs should get paid. 85-100k is a great salary for a lead developer. For technical director, I would be expecting more like 110-120k... Seeing that they're struggling so much to even bring me up to 100k, I imagine the fight to get 100k + 20k in equity is going to be pretty hard.<p>And yes, I understand what stock dilution is.<p>A couple more details: I'm 19, I don't have a degree. My work history as been with 2 other companies, but haven't lasted more than half a year. Maybe this has a huge factor as well?",1313953530

The client will mitigate that risk and take the cost of that mitigation out of your hide.<p>You won't realize it until you and your friends start complaining over beers about how jacked up your big competitors rates are; they aren't, though, they're just not getting rolled by their clients.<p>People here really seem obsessed with the risk that the client is going to change their mind a hundred times. That makes sense, because it's the element of risk that developers actually see, care about, and feel entitled to an opinion about. But some important things about that risk:<p>* Unless you're working for tiny clients, it's much less of a real-world risk than it sounds. Major clients don't start projects with the intent of squeezing extra hours out of their devs. The amount of money they save by doing that is less than a rounding error, and, most importantly, <i>they aren't spending their own money</i> to get you.<p>* There are better levers to pull to mitigate project/schedule risk than quoting at your most flexible and least favorable rate by default.<p>* Even if you shoulder the risk of midstream spec changes, in all likelihood a client that pulls the rug out from under you is probably going to be reasonable about buying more of your time, especially when you say ""no, I can't get that done in the original schedule; I don't see a way to resolve this without adding time to the project"".<p>The middle ground between project and hourly rates has been our default for years:<p>* We break pricing down by person/week<p>* Our proposals loosely attribute milestones to weeks<p>* Any negotiation is conducted over the total project amount<p>* Project price cuts take the form of scope/effort reductions<p>This is a project-based bidding system that leaves you with the ability to say ""no"" or ""you choose, either this new stuff, the original project milestone for the week, or an extra billable week and a new SOW"".",1313953486

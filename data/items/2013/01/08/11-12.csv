By the definition, your strategy will compress the data no better than its Kolmogorov complexity. In this aspect, Kolmogorov complexity measures the data's true randomness. If the random data has been generated correctly its complexity should be near its length, however, so your strategy won't work. (And there is enough evidence that this was the case.) It does not matter whether the data is already known or not; it is the data's inherent randomness prohibiting you to compress it.<p>To be sure, of course, Patrick Craig did not compress it in the pure information theoretic sense.

It won't be a console war, but an ecosystem war.<p>By and large, with the exception of a few exclusives, the 360 and the PS3 have more or less the same set of games. Both were incredibly advanced and were a logical progression of the course that these systems were going. But they both more or less have the same software ecosystem. Most of the library available on one is available on the other.<p>Yet the Wii outsold both of them, using far less advanced technology and offering far inferior on-line play. Many people credit the control scheme, but because of the controls (and an incredible first party development house) Nintendo offered a truly unique software ecosystem.<p>So this current generation we've <i>really</i> had two software ecosystems, the 360/PS3 one and the Wii one.<p>So today we have three new consoles about to hit the market in the upcoming months, Valve's, the Ouya, and Project Shield, right after the Wii U.<p>Valve is going to offer the PC gaming ecosystem and probably the strong on-line offering that PC gamers enjoy, the Ouya and Shield are offering Android (plus some exclusives on either side), and the Wii U will continue to offer Nintendo's ecosystem. This leaves Microsoft and Sony to respond, probably with announcements this year and releases before Christmas of next, with their next offering.<p>Back in the 16-bit days, the market showed that there can really only be two console players. Third place was a very distant third (PC Engine). But it's worth it to keep in mind that the Megadrive/Genesis and Super Famicom/SNES had wildly different software ecosystems as well.<p>In the generation following we had a plethora of platforms as well, and it rapidly shook down to 2 (with 3rd place so bad that Sega made one more go of it with the Dreamcast then exited the business entirely). Nobody remembers the CD-I, 3D0, Jaguar, CD32 from this generation.<p>Following that we had the PS2, XBOX, Gamecube and Dreamcast. It shook down to an unusual <i>3</i> this time, but the XBOX was artificial in this environment with Microsoft willing to lose tons of cash on the investment and if you look at the numbers they really just split 2nd place with the Gamecube.<p>Today instead of two major consoles, we have two major ecosystems. 360/PS3 and Nintendo (in transition to the WiiU)...and we're about to add 2 more to it. I don't think it'll work. Somebody's going to exit the market. It just can't sustain 4 (5 if you count iOS which is kind of stretch).<p>The Console business is <i>hard</i> and the public is fickle.",1357644777

Somewhere within this series of integers, there will be some kind of randomly created pattern, since this is a property of an infinite set. eg. somewhere within the data set, there could be the values [1, 2, 3, ... 10] or [1, 3, 9, .. 27] or [1, 2, 4, 16, 32] - it does not matter which of these patterns, exist, only that there does exist some mathematical pattern in the data.<p>The chances of there being no pattern in a big enough set of random data is impossible as there is a finite number of possible data combinations for bytes [1..256][1..256] etc. I guess a data set of 256^256 bytes would guarantee a pattern, but I'm sure there is a far smaller number that would give 99% confidence.<p>Once you find a pattern in the data, you can remove that pattern and replace it with code that will recreate the pattern using a data offset. ie. you remove the pattern from the data completely, and replace it with a smaller piece of code to recreate that pattern exactly and insert it into the correct position.<p>The key here is that once the data has been generated, it is no longer 'random data', but a fixed input. eg, you cannot compress a random unknown string of bytes, but you can compress the string [1,2,4,16..]<p>The output data would have all possible mathematical patterns removed from it, and the decompression code would be just a list of mathematical functions and data offset points.",1357643395

I've some cash to spend on games, I have a Wii and Xbox360, I'm techie enough to build a gaming rig, but too lazy to bother. I prefer keyboard + mouse to the Xbox controller. $1,000 == 1,000 by the time it hits rip off UK. This is so far out of my price range for a gaming consol it is crazy. Like I could get 3 or 4 playstations for that. Or an Apple Air. Or 3 PC laptops. I hope it's more like 250 then maybe I'd pick one up, but the way things are looking I'm now thinking of hanging onto the xbox360 and picking up an Ouya. Most interesting Indy games will probably make it onto it anyway.",1357643034

I also take a picture of myself. Then I'll write a small program that will combine the image, self shot, title and a map into one image and finally generate a video from those images.<p>Combining this with my OhLife daily diary I hope I'll have a pretty good overview of my life and a treasure of memories (I'm very bad at remembering things from my past).<p>edit: I've now realized that this man was the inspiration for my project (I've seen this before new year) :)",1357643028

So yes, XML uses more space, but you have to ask if 1.5M for 1000000 records is worth inventing your own format that nobody else understands.

The <?xml at the beginning of the file is the ""magic number"" that lets the XML parser guess enough of the encoding to read the ""encoding='whatever'"" part, and then the rest of the file.  Everything is binary though, never treat it as text!<p>The author claims that most editors use latin-1 character encodings; I don't think this is correct.  Everything uses UTF-8 these days, and if your UTF-16-encoded XML has a BOM at the beginning, it will use UTF-16 instead.  So basically, this is not really a problem.  You <i>can</i> use your text editor to edit XML.<p>In the end, it sounds like the author doesn't like file formats that take more than the minimum possible way to store the data.  XML is pretty verbose, but since disk space is cheap and libraries do all of the generation/reading, I don't really care.  XML is far from the solution to every problem, but it is much quicker than rolling my own format which nothing else understands.  (BTW, did the author ever try gzipping the XML?  That should make it much smaller.  libxml2 can even operate directly on gzipped XML files.)",1216143745

Motor gasoline accounts for 19.65 gallons of the finished product.  Next in line is distillate fuel oil at 10.03 gallons.<p>Jet fuel comes in a rather distant third place in the refinement process.  Of the original 42 gallons of crude oil in a barrel, that portion which will end up as jet fuel is 4.07 gallons.  Residual fuel oil accounts for 1.72 gallons of the overall refined product.</i><p>Then there's a list of another thirty things that you get from the remaining leftovers.<p>Rough rule of thumb: add up the number of gallons of non-gasoline products in the paragraphs above and you get about 16 gallons. That's nearly equal to the amount of gas you get from the barrel.

Think of yourself as a guerrilla warrior and right now you're biding your time and building strength.<p>It sounds like you aim to be the CEO type. If that's the case, you've got to train yourself to be a CEO. No one is going to do it for you, at least not if you're an entrepreneur. A CEO wears a lot of hats, but mostly a CEO is a salesman, especially in a startup. So learn about that and get good at it, even if it means you take a job selling someone else's crap for a few months just to know what that's like.<p>Yes, you definitely should learn to program to the point where you can build real things.

246861,comment,246606,246765,0,0,maximilian,,,"I'd argue that the subjectiveness of a paper isn't as totally devoid of a good method.  If you, once you were out of the woods from writing you paper, read it you could probably tell the teacher what grade it should receive.  If you couldn't, if she gave you a great paper, (say an A paper) and you could easily compare the relative merits of each paper.  You'd know immediately if your paper was worthy of an A or not.<p>Its probably all the more difficult for the teacher to grade the lower end of the scale.  Giving a B grade is probably pretty easy.  The paper was pretty good, but not an A.  From there on down it gets difficult to wade through the errors and bad constructions to figure out if perhaps the ideas were of B quality but everything else was a C or D.  I'll bet that the lower end of the scale is the most difficult and gives the most grief.<p>Its like judging climbing routes.  They have this whole rating system (5.8, 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d...) that is wholly subjective, much like an english paper.  However, if you were told that something was a 5.10a, and you could climb it, you could surely judge climbs around it.  ""oh, well that climb was pretty hard, I just barely made it after several tries at the crux (the hardest move). It must be a 5.10b or c.""<p>On a side note, grading ""quantitative"" tests isn't easy or grief free either.  Math tests with lots of mistakes are frustrating.  You want to give as much credit as possible for correctness, but for a multi-step problem, how does one assign points for correct ideas but incorrect implementation.

This is golden.  If anyone here has ever seen a Pinter play acted out, you know exactly what this means, and it is totally spot on.  It's when you totally have begun to talk beyond each other, each sentence containing only enough of the subject continuum to keep you in the conversation, but apart enough to make it clear that nothing is being exchanged at all.",1216141717

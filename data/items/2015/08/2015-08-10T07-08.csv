10033231,comment,10030516,10031528,0,0,jpalomaki,,,"I can only comment for Finland, but at least here it is not so common for people to have company credit cards. If you want to buy something for the company you then either need to find out the person who has the card or use your personal credit card. Both options are bit cumbersome.<p>Getting the person who has the card to enter the necessary card details to a web site is not always convenient. On the other hand passing the card number, cvc etc to many people in the company has certain risks associated with it. Using personal credit card is painful, especially with monthly fees, since you need to do all the paperwork to get money from company.<p>Usually the credit card invoices are not enough for the bookkeeping. You need to have more detailed record about what was purchased and about the VAT included in the price. With shared company credit cards somebody then ends up chasing the actual receipts, which happen to be in somebody&#x27;s inbox.<p>In most cases it is just so much easier to handle things with invoicing. The invoices are handled electronically and usually companies have systems in place which allow the accounting department to just pass the incoming invoice to whoever for approval.<p>A quite good solution this would be a virtual credit card service where somebody could assign &quot;virtual cards&quot; to whoever on the company and put specific monthly/yearly limits on those. It would be pretty nice to add the collection of receipts to this one as well. So the person responsible for specific virtual card, would also upload the invoices that match to the payments made.",1439193143

It&#x27;s still quite experimental, but I did many mechanical proofs manually in the past (mostly in the hardware-related DSLs).<p>> much less the incredibly amount of machinery that must be involved in taking two correctness proofs and producing a correctness proof for their combination.<p>I still cannot understand your point. Why exactly a combination of DSLs is going to introduce any additional complexity?<p>I demonstrated in my examples that mixing the DSLs is exactly the same thing as using them. There is a dataflow dependency between various semantic realms, but it is really hard to break any constraints by merely feeding valid data in and getting a valid data out.<p>So, yes, no existing language workbench enforce language soundness, it&#x27;s up to the designer to ensure the correctness. But, can you name a single general purpose language with an enforced soundness, CompCert aside?<p>> get inter-leaved in unexpected ways<p>Mind providing any examples of this?

I&#x27;m all for the formal proofs and I&#x27;m doing them a lot when it is really necessary (e.g., in hardware, where the cost of error is huge and verification capabilities are limited), but besides that, having a <i>hacking</i> and permissive language allows experimentation, while b&d languages inhibit innovative designs.<p>I only built a b&d, non-Turing-complete (total functional), strictly typed version of my language workbench after years of experimenting on a dynamic, unrestricted codebase.<p>So, my claims are:<p>1) It&#x27;s dead simple to implement eDSLs using metaprogramming, if you&#x27;ve got the right tools (features for dealing with ASTs and their transforms; examples: Nanopass framwork, Racket in general)<p>2) If you have a hierarchy of ready-made DSLs, then with the above approach you can easily mix arbitrarily selected properties of all of your existing languages into a new DSL.<p>3) PEG and GLR are great. The others are inferior. All hail the lexerless parsing!<p>And, btw., my framework is not any different from the other metaprogramming-based language workbenches.

She regularly shows me photos of her city, and her surroundings, and I know what the economic prospects are of the people that live there. My opinion is the exact opposite of yours. I can&#x27;t imagine the despair, the poverty, the lack of potential, that nations such as Bulgaria (median income of about $300-$400 / month) or Romania face. She just watched her grandmother die, with &#x27;free&#x27; healthcare, because the doctors were so horrible they couldn&#x27;t even begin to figure out what was wrong with her, and the local hospital had no MRI or CT machines - as she got worse, they wanted to take her to another hospital in another city, but the family - which has an average income in Romania - had no car to make the trips. So the grandmother died, at about 67 years old, while the family never even found out what she died of. Must be that universal healthcare I hear so much about that everyone but Americans have.<p>I think you&#x27;re completely off base, and obviously so. Americans have among the highest disposable incomes on earth, falling household to income debt levels, and a jobs picture that has been improving non-stop for five years. Americans also have among the highest median household net wealth levels of any nation, and the best universities by far. Bulgaria? That claim almost comes across more as propaganda, when you understand that even Romanians look down upon the poverty in Bulgaria.<p>I personally grew up in one of the poorest parts of America, Appalachia. My experience is the exact opposite of what you describe. Where I lived there were no homeless; wages were half the national average, and we had great public schools, with some of the best rated teachers in the state; everyone had a home, and a car; a nearly zero murder rate; the standard of living was on par with the US median because the cost of living was very low; unemployment was higher, and people lived relatively simple lives when it comes to materialism. This is all mostly still true there today. Compared to the childhood of real poverty my Romanian friend endured growing up there in the 1990s, I grew up in paradise. Where I grew up, the <i>poor</i> there today have access to medical care and routine medical tech via medicaid, which the median household in her Romanian city can&#x27;t get access to without going to Bucharest.<p>But don&#x27;t take my word for it -<p>OECD better life index:<p><a href=""http://cdn.dejanseo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/better-life-index-full.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.dejanseo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/better...</a><p>And<p><a href=""http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2012/06/blogs/graphic-detail/20120609_woc357.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fu...</a><p>You could also run a dozen other economic metrics like long-term unemployed, unemployment rate, median income, median household net worth, household debt to income, health outcomes from medical care, access to the latest medical technology and drugs. You could compare classic markers for materialism for the poverty line and what it&#x27;s defined by in say the US vs Bulgaria. The US does extremely well in most comparisons.

One day we drove out to his place, turning off the gravel road toward a barn. Stepping inside the barn was a surreal experience. There, out in the middle of nowhere, in a fucking barn, was a freshly painted 1950&#x27;s Rolls Royce. It was beautiful.<p>I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s a good example of the economic class divide, though. I understand Kristof&#x27;s larger point and that he&#x27;s writing from his own life experiences, but I think Goff&#x27;s situation is more demonstrative of the rural-urban economic divide than a class divide.<p>He had a skill that people were willing to pay him for, but he chose to restore cars out in the country, in his barn. I can&#x27;t speak for Goff&#x27;s life choices, but during my summers in Yamhill and having relatives that lived in rural areas, I met a lot of people who would rather eke out a meagre existence in the countryside than move to where the jobs are.

I think the people who believe that are ignorant or indifferent or both.<p>However, an ugly bit about the poor that no one wants to confront is culture.  What is to be done about the culture of the poor that locks them in poverty?  I don&#x27;t think throwing more money and resources at the poor helps -unless- it is somehow coupled with culture change.<p>Wasting money/health on cigarette smoking and booze and drugs, credit debt and payday loans and living paycheck to paycheck, dropping out of school, lotto, endless streams of chaotic drama-filled relationships and unprotected sex and babies outside of marriage, junk food and fast food and drinking pop instead of water at every meal...  These things to me aren&#x27;t -only- an education problem, they&#x27;re -also- a culture problem.<p>It&#x27;s judgey for a well-to-do guy like me to talk this way, sorry in advance.  I just find this culture thing very depressing because I don&#x27;t feel there is much that can be done.  It&#x27;s very tempting for me to pick a single group to blame, like the banksters (especially re: payday loans) for being the secret hand in causing all this.  But in my heart, I know the culture of the poor just really sucks in America, and there&#x27;s a lot of wasted human potential.  Nothing is being done to change that culture based on what I see on the boobtube.<p>If you ask me, the victimhood status we confer upon the poor only serves to lock them in their place.

Use of technology amplifies productivity, so that differences between different quantiles of worker productivity become larger, and companies have more incentive to hold out for the potential employees at the top of the food chain. And as it becomes a more competitive environment, there&#x27;s less incentive for the less competitive members to bother participating whatsoever. Since increasingly more of society&#x27;s functions can be performed by smaller segments of the population it shouldn&#x27;t even be that much of an issue, except that, especially in the US with its widespread &quot;screw the non-contributing zeroes&quot; and &quot;let them die&quot; attitudes, no one wants to consider restructuring the system to support the huge portion of the population that didn&#x27;t &quot;make it,&quot; despite that being the same population that the same highly productive individuals are being produced by and drawn from.<p>So my suggestion is it results from productivity differences due to technological advancement, and social welfare programs will not eliminate those differences, they can just help sustain the necessary population that will never be making 250k a year working as a senior engineer for a large tech company.",1439190431

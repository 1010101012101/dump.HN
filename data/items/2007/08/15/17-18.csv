42726,comment,42317,42669,0,0,nickb,,,"So you're trying to be the next reddit.com since that's mostly what ""hackers"" are interested in?<p>Also, the choice of the word ""hacker"" is horrible. Yes, I know the difference between cracker and hacker but you ask anyone out there what a hacker is and they'll tell you it's someone who ""hacks websites and steals credit cards."" To change that perception is a next to impossible task. So, I'm sure we'll enjoy a bunch of newbies coming here and asking how to ""haxor"" their friend's email account.<p>I don't like this change one bit. Are you trying to increase the amount of traffic on this site?",1187200568

42723,comment,42716,42716,0,0,eposts,,,"If you are looking for feedback, I can think of one. Maybe it has to do with comments like these:<p>""Some idiot just karma bombed me. I lost around 10 points. Coward hiding in the shadows.. Step up""<p>Calling someone an idiot/coward.\nMaking a fuss about points lost.<p>I guess this is getting way offtopic now. A book pg highly recommends and that I recently read again is great if you are looking to learn: How to win friends and influence people.\n",1187200258

Tables were created so that you could layout out tabular data / information for presentation.  <p>There hasn't been much in the area of css frameworks besides for YUI and this framework is based on the work of some well-known designers.  The nice thing about this and YUI is that it does help with consistency from browser to browser and it gives you a similar vocabulary to use.  <p>I'm sold on the grid technique in general but I'm not sold on either YUI's grid.css or Blueprint's implementation but they're both very good starts.",1187199607

If our site was boring to us, it was probably boring to the audience we intended it for.  <p>This is hard for business guys to understand, but the people who make the best startup founders often don't care about business very much.  Some of the most successful companies started next year will be started by people who do not currently plan to start companies.",1187199564

42699,comment,42667,42667,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Okay, so I looked at this.  I don't get the point of the grid system.  Rather, what I want to know is: if you're going to laboriously simulate tables in CSS classes, why not just use tables?  It would be simpler, more easily understandable by human readers, scales up and down better (Blueprint doesn't do non-fixed layouts yet, apparently), and in HTML4, at least, would usually involve less markup.<p>Against this, it wouldn't be quite as easily read for the tiny fraction of a percent that use screen readers.  That seems like a very small price to pay for the major wins.",1187197501

The anti EU people in the UK are...... you guessed it... right wing. Fairly extreme right in UK terms, but probably still left wing by US standards. So, for them, the US is an aspiration further right.<p>IMHO, the EU makes total sense, even if there are many problems with it, and even the US government have urged the UK to get more in to Europe and stop antagonizing it. Partly I think the US likes having the UK as a gateway to Europe. I just wish we in the UK got more out of that deal than we do, like equality and fairness in our deals.<p>Right now, despite my criticism of the US, I&#x27;d prefer to be a 51st state, since we&#x27;d Brits would no longer have no rights over US excesses.

www.fuelup.co<p>Recent research by the IMF shows that big business is moving 25% of its R&D budget into open innovation, startup acceleration and incubator programs in 2013.  They understand it is an effective way to find new ideas, opportunities and grow business.<p>Exploring this new avenue is not without its problems, however.  It can be difficult for corporates to find the right startup at the right time and they do not necessarily have the in-house expertise to research the multitude of options available.  Meanwhile, startups encounter their own set of complications.  They often lack clients, marketing and sales expertise.<p>FUEL UP seeks to address these issues by creating a global overview of the tech and corporate landscape, finding the winning startup for the right business and making that connection.<p>FUEL UP provides corporates with the technology that allows them to discover, track and connect to startups globally.  The powerful in-house software continuously ranks startups based on a stringent selection criteria which includes:  sector, team and traction.  Potential propositions are then matched to the clients business on a daily basis as determined by users profile and preferences.<p>FUEL UP has an agreement in place with the Global Accelerator Network which connects its database to more than 60 accelerator programs worldwide.  This allows businesses to stay on top of the most recent, relevant and cutting-edge innovations.",1372844868

I started out with Smalltalk, then started doing C# professionally and eventually started doing CL in emacs.  CL/SLIME/Emacs was by <i>far</i> the worst of that trilogy.  I can&#x27;t think of one single thing that the emacs combo did better or even as good.<p>Both Smalltalk and VS+Resharper have great refactoring tools.  Both have great debugging tools (and in Smalltalk I can even do a lot of development right inside the debugger and watch how the code is reacting while I&#x27;m writing it).  In the CL/Emacs setup debugging is so bad most people recommend not to even bother; just use tracing.  And I can&#x27;t understand why it needs to be like this, CL is closer to Smalltalk than it is C# (that is, CL is a &quot;live&quot; language as Smalltalk is or at least it very much can be.  Even a compile-only CL like SBCL).<p>The other issue is project management.  In Smalltalk it doesn&#x27;t really come into play as much since the image is your &quot;exe&quot;, but despite this Smalltalk has great tools for organizing classes, methods and so on (and Dolphin&#x27;s way of letting your image be a &quot;solution&quot; and you make individual exes from that that drop everything they didn&#x27;t use was absolutely brilliant).  In VS, I create my assemblies, make dependencies and so on and the IDE just handles all this for me.<p>Contrast that with CL/Emacs: CL has ASDF files that can manage all your dependencies for you (people complain about it, but I&#x27;ve used them for several years and never had any problems) but you have to manage all this stuff manually.  If you want a nice way of saying &quot;create new package&quot; or &quot;create a new file that is in this package&quot; you&#x27;ll need to write all that handling, UI, etc. yourself.  And after you write it all, what will you have?  The interface will be hideous no matter how you do it because you&#x27;re restricted to just text.  In Visual Studio you can have the disapearable side bars approach, the &quot;old school mac&quot; approach of different info windows floating all over the desktop, etc.  With emacs you&#x27;d be restricted to doing that stuff via ascii art or popping up more windows with ugly ascii art in them.<p>The only way I could see CL/Emacs as the future is if we&#x27;re talking post-apocalyptic.",1372843918

You could, with Google Reader, use a vast multitude of RSS clients: you didn&#x27;t have to use Google Reader proper. And, because nearly everyone supported Google Reader as a common sync API, you could switch between clients without losing your place or your data. Want to try X flavor-of-the-month RSS app? No problem: just log in with your Google account. Don&#x27;t like it? No problem either: switch back to your other RSS client and everythingeven what articles you&#x27;ve read and starredare right where you left off.<p>Now, there&#x27;s at least a half dozen competing and incompatible sync APIs and numerous perfectly-adequate RSS clients rendered obsolete because they haven&#x27;t been updated to support other sync services. Because of the lack of a common and ubiquitous sync API, choosing an RSS client now that Google Reader is gone will be more locked down than before, at least for the foreseeable future.<p>Which is Marco&#x27;s point: companies don&#x27;t want you to be able to freely move your data around.

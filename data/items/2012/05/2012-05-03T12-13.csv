I wanted to try XMonad after hearing people talk about it so much, but I figured with 10 years of having burned the same workflow into my fingers it would take me some time, so I sort of budgeted some playing-around time on my home computer of a few days before I even considered putting it on my work computer.<p>It really surprised me that by the end of the first evening I was already pretty good with it and by the end of the second day didn't want to go back. I disagree that it's a big productivity enhancer, I think there's some excitement bias there, but even after a couple of days I did find myself preferring it, which was actually contrary to my expectations.<p>It helps that I know Haskell well enough to truly understand the configuration file and configure it using Haskell <i>qua</i> Haskell, and not just copy-and-paste snippets from others (I also added some DBus support to manage volumes using Haskell DBus modules, though it's not tested enough to share), so I would say that if there's a tiling manager in a language you already know (Lua has one for instance, I think), you may want to try that one. I would also say this is not all that great a way to <i>learn</i> Haskell, the subset it uses for config is too small, and opaque if you don't already know what's going on. But tiling managers in general work better than I thought they would.",1336049267

Because of this, we can't use some popular Python libraries like Pygame since they aren't hardware-accelerated [for transformations], and hence run too slow.",1336046546

b) or lyrics that I've known by heart for 10+years and that anyway don't matter much to me (no emotional attachment).<p>Everything else is distracting.   Apocalyptica is a favorite for coding, but anything that fits (a)/(b) would do.",1336046544

I've been underpaid and overworked for sure.<p>But put things in perspective.  Being a skilled programmer is one of safest careers you could have in these days of cold economic downturn.  Instead of worrying about being downsized, realize that even a company in the red can afford to hire you to automate processes which currently require paid employees.  In other words, you have the ability generate direct ROI which is not the case for many employees these days.<p>I think a work to live mentality is good.  There's no reason you can't be a great programmer working your 40 hours a week and then going home.  There are plenty of companies that will appreciate what you bring to the table.  You could also try a lifestyle business rather than joining the ""startup lottery"", though if you really see it as a lottery then you're devaluing the impact that individual decision-making plays, and you will never be an A-player with that attitude.",1336046525

3923391,comment,3922528,3923334,2,0,babarock,,,"To be fair, my diatribe is not geared at self-taught programmers. I have a lot of admiration for the people who learn programming that way, and I personally consider that most of the (theoretical, formal, CS) knowledge I got came from self-teaching, picking up a book and personal experimentation despite having earned a Masters in Engineering that taught me more about corporate bullshit like ""Project Management"" or ""Work Ethics"" than it did on programming - The sad state of engineering schools in France, a whole different subject.<p>What I'm merely pointing out is the ridiculously short amount of time the article is promising its readers. 3 months? Really?<p>I have been programming for a while now, borderline obsessing about it for the past 2 years and a half, and frankly, I feel like I still know so little. When yet another blogger tells her cool marketing friends that they too can learn to code with such few efforts, it makes me chuckle. And cry a little.",1336046411

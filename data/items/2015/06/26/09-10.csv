9783222,comment,9782368,9783199,0,0,moyix,,,"Return-oriented programming is an exploit technique that relies on reusing snippets of existing code (called <i>gadgets</i>) in a program in order to carry out attacker code. Each gadget generally ends with a return instruction, which causes it to read the address of the next gadget off the stack and jump to it. In this way, arbitrarily complex code can be built up by chaining together sequences of gadgets controlled by an initial set of return addresses on the stack.<p>It&#x27;s used as a way to defeat DEP (Data Execution Prevention); with DEP the attacker can no longer write code into memory and then execute it, so instead they just set up the stack cleverly so they can carry out a return-oriented payload (most commonly, these payloads just disable DEP and then move on to a more traditional second stage).<p>More info:<p>The paper that introduced the name ROP (though some would argue that the techniques existed before this paper): <a href=""https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf</a><p>Wikipedia: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming</a>",1435312239

While it&#x27;s nearly 20 years old, it&#x27;s taken a surprisingly long time for this to become widely understood and tackled.<p>Even today, tools like Automake default to recursion.  It offers a non-recursive mode if you explicitly enable it and adapt your code to use it.  I did this for my projects when the support was originally added, and the improvement is noticable, from both a speed point of view and overall maintainability.  If you&#x27;re not using Makefile generators, the effect is even more dramatic.<p>Today I use CMake for all new projects and have converted from Automake for some older projects.

All homes are rented by management companies, full background checks, the likes. Being able to rent one, even this far out from Atlanta (think 25 miles) apparently is very desirable and not as simple as showing up with the money.  After a few years they either sell out right or do a limited rent to own.<p>The surprise to me is that there is still substantial turnover in renters.

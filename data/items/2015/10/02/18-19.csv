Freakonomics did a pretty interesting piece on it.

10320527,comment,10314895,10319709,0,0,mrchicity,,,"No. Vanguard is a large participant in the markets because it manages funds for long-term investors. Markets have bid and offer prices where you can instantaneously sell or buy shares, and these bids and offers are often provided by professional market-makers. Before automation, these were humans on an exchange floor. They could only trade a single stock at a time, hence the name &quot;specialist&quot;, since they specialized in that issue. Volumes were also lower. To make enough to earn a living, that human on the exchange floor had to charge a big spread between buy and sell prices. For a long-term investor, this spread is an additional friction cost that drags on their returns when rebalancing portfolios.<p>Now a small team of researchers can make markets on many securities at once. They don&#x27;t have to make as much money on each, so the spreads get smaller. Additionally, instead of a monopolistic specialist, these professional traders compete to win transactions by making better prices (higher bids and lower offers) than others. Many market makers try to keep a neutral &quot;book&quot; of positions, so if they sell some GS they may bid higher in other bank stocks to reduce their exposure to market risk. The faster a market maker can update his quotes or hedge when conditions change, the less spread he needs to charge.<p><a href=""http://meanderful.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/hfts-dirty-little-secret-where-money.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meanderful.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/hfts-dirty-little-...</a>",1443812343

I&#x27;d think recruiters aren&#x27;t any more apt to say something like that than other technologists. That seems like social skills issues, and I don&#x27;t think recruiters are generally considered poor in that area.<p>3 - The relationship is often sour on both sides, to some degree, for a variety of reasons. Recruiters would have to be blind not to see the contempt from many technologists. I think part of this is the knowledge that the candidate holds the final say in a transaction that might net the recruiter tens of thousands of dollars. That gives the technologist a feeling of power - &quot;If I turn down this offer, the recruiter &#x27;loses&#x27; 25K&quot;. Some recruiters make more money than the technologists they represent, which might also cause some issues.<p>4 - Agreed. Concise makes sense for both sides of the equation. Time is money for recruiters on commission. And if you are a Py dev that knows GIS, we should talk. (sorry, couldn&#x27;t help myself)<p>5 - Again, as I&#x27;ve said to others here, we can&#x27;t even try to read your minds. One candidate doesn&#x27;t want to hear about benefits, one doesn&#x27;t want to hear about the office, and you don&#x27;t want to hear about company growth or stability. The problem here isn&#x27;t that they are growing, the problem here is that they aren&#x27;t paying you what you want. They could say whatever they wanted and you probably wouldn&#x27;t care if they offered you 100/hr.<p>6 - This is a genuine problem, and I have no problem sharing that with candidates. I actually make a point of sharing it on most occasions, as I want to make sure candidates weigh my advice based on my incentives. If I stand to make 50K off a transaction, you might think I could be less truthful than if I only stood to make 5K. Incentive to lie decreases as the value of your reputation increases.<p>You mention hourly rate, so I assume you&#x27;ve done contract work. One interesting aspect of recruiting is that a recruiter increases his/her personal income when negotiating  higher salaries for permanent hire candidates (where FEE = $SALARY x $FEEPERCENTAGE, but in contracting the recruiter maximizes income by negotiating hourly rate down (where the recruiter earns $BILLRATE - $PAYRATE).<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts, interesting perspective.",1443811309

I see a number of issues:<p>1. Reason Codes: FCRA reason codes that the lender has to generate will be a PR nightmare if they decline the loan application based on Facebook data -- imagine a consumer getting a rejection reason as &#x27;Your fiends have poor credit rating so we don&#x27;t want to give you credit&#x27;.<p>2. Discrimination / Disparate impact: Most people who are poor also have poor friends and this type of analysis will lead to disparate impact that the article talks about and there is no way around it -- even if they get a slightly different interpretation of FCRA they are not going to solve disparity easily.<p>3. CRA Regulation around data quality: Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA) has specific mandates around providing accurate information about the the borrower. If a borrower thinks it is wrong, they can request the CRA to fix it through a dispute process -- this is a very time-intensive, expensive process for a CRA.  I doubt Facebook would want to build a process for disputes and the disputes are going to be worse -- before I will say, I paid my credit card on time and you got it wrong to the credit bureau. Now I may say, I don&#x27;t think my friend&#x27;s rating is low and Facebook has to due diligence before they can claim it is correct.<p>I can see a few ways they might go about this:<p>1. Second shot at approval as opposed to decline: A lender may reject an application and may choose to use Facebook data to give the borrower a second chance. This is better for the borrower and the regulators may be ok with this type of approach. Although they need to be careful with banks not suddenly changing their FICO Score cut off to something very high so they can fall back on this.<p>2. Only make it available internationally: not all countries have such strong protections around consumer credit data. Also, many countries don&#x27;t have a robust credit bureau and this may actually help consumers.<p>3. Focus on alternative payday lending: CFPB is keen on opening up newer sources of data for certain segments that do not get any credit today. They may be open to this approach if fb can show that it will allow lenders to provide credit to people who they wouldn&#x27;t have before.<p>I have strong views about FCRA / ECOA and I feel most of the provisions in there are actually beneficial to the consumers. Even though my startup SimplyCredit is in the fintech space and would greatly benefit from relaxed regulation, I do think it is good to have strong consumer protection and that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t use anything outside of what will be considered as &#x27;payment behavior / financial management&#x27;.<p>I cringe every time a new fintech company claims they monitor how fast you can type or analyze your github profile to give you credit -- either they say these things for marketing but really using it for underwriting or actually using it and breaking many provisions of FCRA. The last thing I want to do is decline a person with disability for typing slowly -- especially when the focus is to really help consumers and not to showoff your power to analyze such realtime data!<p>Instead of data sources like Facebook, I would welcome a cleaner source of data with verified income and employment.",1443810610

The objective was to codify, in machine-usable form, millions of pieces of knowledge that compose human common sense. CycL presented a proprietary knowledge representation schema that utilized first-order relationships.[1] In 1986, Doug Lenat estimated the effort to complete Cyc would be 250,000 rules and 350 man-years of effort.[2] The Cyc Project was spun off into Cycorp, Inc. in Austin, Texas in 1994.\nThe name &quot;Cyc&quot; (from &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, pronounced [saɪk] like syke) is a registered trademark owned by Cycorp. The original knowledge base is proprietary, but a smaller version of the knowledge base, intended to establish a common vocabulary for automatic reasoning, was released as OpenCyc under an open source (Apache) license. More recently, Cyc has been made available to AI researchers under a research-purposes license as ResearchCyc.\nTypical pieces of knowledge represented in the database are &quot;Every tree is a plant&quot; and &quot;Plants die eventually&quot;. When asked whether trees die, the inference engine can draw the obvious conclusion and answer the question correctly. The Knowledge Base (KB) contains over one million human-defined assertions, rules or common sense ideas. These are formulated in the language CycL, which is based on predicate calculus and has a syntax similar to that of the Lisp programming language.\nMuch of the current work on the Cyc project continues to be knowledge engineering, representing facts about the world by hand, and implementing efficient inference mechanisms on that knowledge. Increasingly, however, work at Cycorp involves giving the Cyc system the ability to communicate with end users in natural language, and to assist with the knowledge formation process via machine learning.\nLike many companies, Cycorp has ambitions to use Cyc&#x27;s natural language processing [3] to parse the entire internet to extract structured data.[4]\nIn 2008, Cyc resources were mapped to many Wikipedia articles,[5] potentially easing connecting with other open datasets like DBpedia and Freebase.&quot;",1443809481

Compare that to proprietary while we&#x27;re at it. I predict results aren&#x27;t going to look good for GPL&#x27;s success rate and that&#x27;s without a financial requirement.<p>Far as compilers, proprietary are winning out in terms of longevity, it&#x27;s a select few proprietary vs GCC in terms of performance, GCC in uptake, LLVM with decent performance/uptake, and some others with intended academic uptake. So far, that&#x27;s barely any GPL, one industrial BSD, quite a few academic (MIT/BSD licensed), and many proprietary. Apples to apples, GCC is barely special except in what it offers for free and how hard it is to extend. That&#x27;s why LLVM was designed and why Apple built on it, among other companies and OSS-loving academics. After a mere market survey, GCC suddenly doesn&#x27;t look amazing.<p>Now what&#x27;s your thoughts on GPL getting the only development when I bring up Apache, BIND, FreeBSD, Sendmail, and so on?

It rewards you for choosing who you are willing to be friends with based on their creditworthiness.  It punishes people who have associations with people with poor credit.<p>It essentially keeps good people down too. If you are a role model in your group of peers.  If you&#x27;re the guy out of your group of friends who got an education and got a steady job.  If you pay your bills and don&#x27;t carry debt, and you want to buy a house and have the money and responsibility to do so, you should be allowed to.  When you do that, it shows those friends what you can do, and it allows you to move forward.<p>On the other hand, if you get an education, get a job, pay your bills, and don&#x27;t carry debt, but when you go to buy a house your mortgage application is denied simply because you have some friends who are struggling on facebook, what is the impact of that?  It just causes you to stop moving up.  Maybe it discourages you.  Maybe it makes you realize that the world doesn&#x27;t really want you to be better than what your friends have become.<p>What the problem is has less to do with being judged by your actions, but rather being judged by the actions of those you associate with.",1443808806

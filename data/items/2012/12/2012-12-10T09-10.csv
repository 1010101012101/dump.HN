4898267,comment,4897992,4898039,9,0,tikhonj,,,"This is one of the reasons I really like property-based testing  la QuickCheck[1]. The core idea is simple: you come up with an invariant for your code and the testing framework checks this invariant with randomly generated inputs. So when you're writing a test, you just have to come up with interesting invariants; you do not have to guess which inputs are edge cases.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickCheck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Introduction_to_QuickChec...</a><p>This may sound complicated and seem like overkill, but I've actually found it <i>easier</i> to use this style of tests for much of my code. Having randomly generated inputs can help find edge cases I did not even consider when writing the code in the first place--this addresses the bias issue you are worried about.<p>I also find that this style of test results in concise, easy to read tests. The usual ""hello world"" example uses the reverse function for lists. We want to ensure that for all lists, reversing it twice does nothing. The test would look like this:<p><pre><code>    prop_reverseTwice ls = reverse (reverse ls) == ls
</code></pre>
It's very easy to tell what invariant you're testing for! (The prop_* name is a convention for this sort of test.)<p>While real invariants are often more complex, I find they are still usually easy to read right from the code for the test.<p>Anyhow: you should really try QuickCheck or something like it for your language of choice.",1355132179

With that level of training, or even 4 hours of really basic first aid training, you know enough to help.  I won't be writing any dissertations on the best way to deal with a specific kind of trauma, but I can do a pretty good job of stopping bleeding in most cases.  You're not going to have a top-flight trauma surgeon in every car.  The 200-hour tech isn't going to be operating on his own (ideally), but can be a part of the solution.  For some fields, like datacenter operations, experience is worth more than formal training, too.<p>Plus, there actually are a surprising number of cases where a relative newcomer to a field actually does end up advancing the theoretical limits.  Maybe it's due to not knowing and accepting the limits of the field at the time, or maybe it's because that moderately passable junior programmer also happens to be a world-class expert in some other domain which just happens to be similar to the problem at hand, but it's not all that uncommon.<p>I'd still prefer any pending neurosurgery on me be done by someone with a good amount of experience, credentialing, and expertise, but it's a rare Django app which requires that level of caution :)",1355131691

The whole subject is however rather interesting, being a very political subject but also one where experiments and statistics tend to go against common opinion.<p>Okey, this is from a Swedish perspective, as that is the only perspective I got. Anyway, the Swedish state educational overseeing body has made several attempts to improve equality in education, normally marked at getting more women and colored people in white men dominated areas. The biggest attempt, which was started in the 1990s, were a rather simple rule. It said ""If a student applying for a class would be a minority in a the class thanks to race or sex, that student shall receive a small bonus in the application"". No judgment call was used in the applying of the bonus, but in 2007 it ended, and the primary reason it ended was because the target group (women and colored people) was not in the group actually normally receiving the bonus. Rather, 95% of the time, it was a white male, applying to a class where he would be a minority in.<p>This is actually not that extremely surprising if one consider that 2/3 of the students in Sweden are women. It also not that surprising given that every areas of education except engineering and one form of math (abstract-math past 3rd year university), have women as the dominating group. Classes are rather clustered in women and men density. The state overseeing body for education did suggest after reviewing the program that maybe they should start some men-only courses in areas which are highly dominated by women students. That suggestion however got turn down rather immediately, as it was viewed ludicrously impossible.<p>Maybe there is some pedagogical value of women-only and men-only classes. There clearly are anecdotal evidence on it, and the numbers do tell that men are more willing to attempt entering a woman dominated class, than a women trying to enter a men dominated class. But as a method to get more equality in education and encouraging a 50/50 setup, based on the Swedish attempts I must say it does not work as intended. To reach that goal, I think further studies of what actually work is needed. Something great this academy could do is to create a research study on the effects, with an control group, and maybe even a men-only class to match.",1355130408

GaTech and Emory, of course, and the CDC draw their share of talent.  Lots of my friends or spouses worked in places like that.<p>Art culturewise there's not a lot.  A solid underground band scene, you could see good hardworking indie bar bands nightly if you wanted.  A world-class but underappreciated symphony.  So-so art museum.  Great archaeology  museum at Emory, better than anything LA has. Gallery scene is eh. Theater scene is eh. Some film culture, but spotty. Decent foodie culture, though not on the scale of a major foodie hub. A much, much, much more vibrant LGBT culture than you might expect.<p>A good number of outdoorsy people.

4898170,comment,4896134,4896936,1,0,Jach,,,"To quote myself, ""...I still occasionally pipe the results of find through grep -v and then on to something else..."" I agree find is greatly useful for the purpose of finding files (I don't know how Windows sysadmins could live without it) and learning its basics is important in one's mastery of the shell, but it's clearly ""not like the others"". It has useful options to control its behavior like outputting with null separation (something I wish `ls` had), following symbolic links, searching up to a maxdepth limit, and limiting the type to file or directory. And in the same way you can make justifications for the utility of other `find` features, but for nearly all of them and the ones I mentioned they have an irregular syntax. There are also things that obsolete `find`'s features like `xargs` that are simple to use and easy to understand and are useful in more contexts than `find`, even if using them has some performance hits. (And `locate` obsoletes `find` almost entirely because of performance when you need to search big swathes of your system.)<p>I think Ritchie sums up my feelings for `find` with ""...we were somewhat put
off by the syntax of their things.  However, they were clearly quite useful..."" `find` is useful, it's just not Unix-y. Does it still follow some of the Unix Philosophy in spirit? Maybe. I think there's also a chance that Unix Philosophy in its purest form is mostly dead in practice and has been for a while. Just look at the evolution of echo.c: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1091803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1091803</a><p>I'll readily agree that `ls .. | grep -v ..` can break, but I don't find anything archaic or non-Unix-y about it like I do with the `find` version. (Also every time someone uses `cat .. | grep ..`, a kitten dies. :( )<p>Finally, it's not the newbie-unfriendliness that `find` has, it's the irregularity and kitchen sink of features that aren't expressive and don't generalize well, as the other repliers elaborate on. In my experience `sed` and `awk` are more regular, more generally useful, and have less ""intuition traps"" than `find`. (As sort of a neatity aside from their surface-level expressiveness, both sed and awk are Turing-complete. I think it's interesting that my man page for sed(1) is 267 lines, my man page for gawk(1) is a hefty 1713 lines, and my man page for find(1) is also a hefty 1446 lines.)",1355130068

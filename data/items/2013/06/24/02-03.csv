5930736,comment,5930640,5930640,49,0,gruseom,,,"It&#x27;s sad that the classical education is no more, but it&#x27;s also true that the humanities rotted from within. Because carrying on the traditions of arts and letters was no longer considered valuable, the disciplines rushed to gut themselves in favor of far shallower and dodgier stuff, like political ideologies (&quot;the only things that matter are race, class, and gender&quot;) and pseudo-technical gibberish. None of that has lasting value and none of it touches the heart of why a student would want to devote themselves to things like literature, philosophy, or art history. So over the same time period that these fields have been losing social and intellectual status, they&#x27;ve also been becoming less valuable.<p>They&#x27;re not going to disappear, and maybe it&#x27;s a good thing if they become de-institutionalized for a century or two. I admit to being bothered by it, though. By the time I went to university it was already no longer possible to get what I would call a real education. Meanwhile there is a smugness that goes along with purely technical training, a certainty that its way is the only valuable way, that calls itself education but whose true name is Philistinism, and I feel sad that that mentality is taking over our society completely.",1372042788

5930712,comment,5929207,5930542,6,0,taliesinb,,,"According to Wolfram, Cook&#x27;s <i>job</i> was to prove Rule 110 was universal. Cook didn&#x27;t &quot;discover&quot; it as an independent action.<p>In a very direct sense, this was a software development task, where the program that was being written was precisely a universal program (through several layers of emulation, of course; rule 110 -> &#x27;particle computer&#x27; -> cyclic tag system -> Turing machine). It&#x27;s an impressive program, but also quite mechanical. More details: <a href=""http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-681#previous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-681#previous</a><p>Here&#x27;s the timeline as far as I&#x27;ve been able to determine, mostly from sources inside the company:<p>0. Wolfram tasked Cook with finding a proof that 110 was universal.<p>1. With encouragement and help, Cook finished the proof many years before the book was ready.<p>2. Cook tried to publish the program/proof at some complexity conference.<p>3. Wolfram asked him not to, because it was against the terms of his contract.<p>4. Cook agreed not to, but then did it anyway.<p>5. Wolfram threatened legal action to prevent the proof being published.<p>This kind of thing is clearly a breakdown of the relationship between Cook and Wolfram. Is there a good guy and a bad guy? Maybe, maybe not. But if we see this proof as a program, I&#x27;m sure many people would agree that publishing code one was paid to write, without permission, is kind of a no-no.<p>To my mind, this doesn&#x27;t so much paint Wolfram as a lawsuit-happy egomaniac as it does expose some of the contradictions of a running a private company as a commercial venture <i>and</i> as a vehicle for one&#x27;s own research.<p>edit: I work for Wolfram, as probably some HN users already know and as I mention elsewhere on this thread. But when I heard about the whole Cook thing a couple of years ago, I asked around about what happened to make sure I wasn&#x27;t working for a company that was unethical.

There\nwill be the issue of a plaintiff having &#x27;standing&#x27;\nto bring the case, but maybe now 120 million\nVerizon customers have such standing;\nif not, likely still Google does.  At this point,\nsomeone&#x27;s <i>gotta</i> have enough standing.<p>Then\nthe &#x27;conclusion&#x27; is that in 1-2 years we will\nfind out what the SCOTUS wants to do about\nwhat appear to be laws enabling serious violations\nof at least the Fourth Amendment.<p>To respond\nto much of the discussion in this thread, I\nmade a side point that it is the job of the SCOTUS\nto defend the Constitution and not to\npermit bending the Constitution so that\nthe Executive branch can find it easier to\ngo after bad guys.  So, in particular, a lot\nof the discussion here about just how\nwe will get the bad guys will mostly\njust be set aside during this process\nand mostly the SCOTUS will not be\nmuch influenced by that consideration.\nSure, maybe some Admin lawyer can\nargue something about &#x27;treason&#x27;\nor &quot;the Constitution is not a suicide\npact&quot;, but my guess is that the\nmain issue will be just a simple,\nclear protection of at least the Fourth\nAmendment.  SCOTUS is interested in defending\nthe Constitution and not much interested\nin how to stop Boston wackos with\npressure cookers.<p>For a longer term &#x27;conclusion&#x27;, I pointed out\nthat if after the SCOTUS decision the\ncitizens still want NSA listening in on\npillow talk, steamy e-mails,\ntracking people to their romantic\nmeetings, etc., then we can\ntry to amend the Constitution.<p>> If your point is that we will ultimately be protected by the Supreme Court, I think you are wrong.<p>No, in simplest terms the process has started;\nlikely nothing can stop it; SCOTUS will \nmake a decision, in all likelihood defending\nthe Constitution; and then we will see where\nwe stand.<p>That this process will move inexorably to\na solid (the other two branches won&#x27;t argue with it)\nconclusion is, in the context of\nmuch of the discussion in this thread,\nquite significant:  Or, we can discuss\nthis and that issue and fine point and\nwhat if, but, still, this unstoppable\nprocess will move to its conclusion which\npromises to be quite meaningful.<p>For being &quot;protected&quot;, I see no alternative to\nthe usual from Jefferson<p>&quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance&quot;.<p>For Obamacare, I don&#x27;t know what the legal\nstatus is or what cases have been decided.<p>For me, my guess is just that Obamacare is\nso poorly designed that too soon so many\npeople will be screaming bloody murder,\nespecially appropriate in the context,\nthat Congress will just repeal it.<p>I don&#x27;t think that Obamacare was ever\na serious attempt to help the US healthcare\nsystem but just some political posturing\n-- Nancy had a <i>really</i> good time,\na <i>lot</i> of fun.  She had the smile of \na Homecoming Queen.  Now that she&#x27;s\nhad her good time, we can go back to\nreality.<p>Obama?\nHe knows nothing about Obamacare:  How do we know?\nBecause during his efforts at helping it\npass, too soon he said things that were\nreally dumb, got slapped down hard, and then\njust shut up.  In particular, at one point\nthe US College of Surgeons put out\nthat what Obama said was &quot;uninformed,\nmisinformed, just plain wrong, and dangerous&quot;.\nAnd that caused Obama to shut up.\nOne more point was, one of his tear jerk\ncases said that due to her existing\nbad health she couldn&#x27;t get insurance.\nNonsense:  All she had to do was move to\na state with &#x27;community rating&#x27;, e.g.,\nas I&#x27;ve been told, NYS.  Obama&#x27;s interest\nin Obamacare was about political posturing,\nnot healthcare.  Also someone from Arkansas,\nmaybe Bill Clinton, said\nthat Arkansas had a program for\npeople like her.<p>If the IRS comes after many people,\nObamacare will go down in flames.<p>But for SCOTUS and Obamacare, that case\nis less clearly about the Constitution\nthan the attack on the\nFourth Amendment by grabbing all that\nVerizon data.",1372041929

Make sure it&#x27;s something a bigger company like Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, etc would be interested in. Make a real go at building a business, and doing the hard PM work. Hire others to do the engineering work so you can focus on the PM skills. This may also take 5 years before you land your dream PM role. If you play your cards right, you may land in a PM role with a nice exit as well.<p>3) Go get an MBA from a top school that Google, Facebook, and Microsoft actively recruit from.

Outsourced means being exposed to risk from your supplier -- by the company itself, by its employees, or by governments.  Gmail has somewhat better technical security to protect from outside non-state hackers than your average self-hosted exchange server, and from insiders (the IT guy, like Snowden, may not have the same goals as the organization...), but that may or may not make up for the ease of serving a third-party communications service provider.<p>I still prefer well-run self-hosted mail unless:<p>* You have a <6 month retention policy (i.e. so ECPA&#x27;s weaker protections are a non issue) (which can be specified in Google Apps for Your Domain)<p>* You don&#x27;t have the technical competence to run your own mail server (which gets complicated in a larger organization due to HR risk), or don&#x27;t have the business competence to hire a contractor to run it in-house in such a way that their staff don&#x27;t become a huge risk.<p>There&#x27;s a third way which would be a lot better for everyone, but it&#x27;s not technically feasible yet -- a way to outsource some aspects of the server without giving up control.",1372039459

If Hong Kong did not intend to comply then some reasoning would be found, &quot;mistakenly&quot; or otherwise, within the legal code to technically invalidate or delay the request.<p>Apparently Hong Kong or China didn&#x27;t feel like complying.

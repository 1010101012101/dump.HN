I came to a similar conclusion years ago and would be interested in retracing your steps.<p>As for the not-understanding-it part, how is it hard to understand? It's effective marketing. The industry doesn't make money by people getting better, it makes money by getting (their) drugs into them. Humans are a vehicle for the delivery of their product. (So now are pets. The opening of the pet market for antidepressants is so classic a move that it will surely be studied in business schools.)<p>The vegetable oil industry did the same thing, ingeniously, against dairy fat. Remember those decades of propaganda about how butter and cream mean cholestorol which means heart attacks which mean death? It was an industry contrivance. The original studies it was based on were shamelessly cherry-picked. The campaign leveraged the widespread public fear that derived from the heart-attack epidemic of the 1950s and 60s. (Edit: I learned this from a CBC Ideas episode a few years ago.)",1257181196

917187,comment,916924,917049,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Actually, I make a point of asking to see a sample of production code anywhere I interview, and have done for a while. Nowhere has ever refused, although most places have asked to wait until the following interview if not warned in advance (which is best if possible).<p>This has been a very enlightening practice. To date, almost 100% of the places that showed me code put me off enough that I wouldn't have accepted any offer from them. The way they wrote their code told me more about the deep-rooted problems they had than anything anyone could ever say or not say in an interview.<p>It was fairly obvious to all concerned that those places and I weren't a good fit, though, and most didn't make me an offer in the end anyway. But if feedback was at all honest, asking to see their code has nothing to do with that, and in fact it was more often taken as a positive sign that I was genuinely interested, which at that stage I was.<p>My other favourite thing to do is turn questions around. If the people interviewing me at a smaller company are supposedly the senior technical people and they're assessing my abilities during a discussion about a code snippet (mine or theirs) in the interview, then I'm going to assess theirs as well: I will use a certain level of terminology, or mention related concepts, or allude to alternative design possibilities, and watch for their reactions and where the discussion goes. In other words, I would be assessing technical interviewers just the same way that I assess a candidate from the other side of the table, and for much the same reasons.<p>By the way, you should never feel insulted just because someone asks you to write code at interview, no matter what your level. I used to get some mild irritation from that, but having interviewed supposedly very experienced candidates, I have found that even those with great-looking CVs can be clueless no-hires in practice. The point of the basic coding test isn't to make the really good people stand out, it's to make the really bad people stand out. Of course, if you rapidly produce a decent answer to the simple coding problem, continuing with more simple coding problems starts to say more about the interviewer/company policy than anything else, and you might reasonably question whether they are wasting your time at that point.",1257181119

If the reason you are getting a Ph.D. is because you want to teach college kids or get a 'BGN' job, you are doing it for the wrong reasons. The only reason to get a Ph.D. is because you want to publish academic research. And if you show up without already knowing what you want to be researching, you're probably not ready to get a Ph.D. yet.<p>That's not to say that academia isn't horribly broken, it is, but in some places it really seems like the author is going off in the wrong direction.",1257181039

The punchline is that our software occasionally doubled-up samplers in order to increase the probability of detecting a release.<p>The problem domain is a biological or chemical release in a building.  Given a suite of possible release scenarios (variable release locations, amounts, and dispersion conditions), find the sampler network with the highest probability of detecting a release.  Pretty much everything is probabilistically defined, including how likely each scenario, and how likely a sampler is to detect a given mass of the released substance.  Critical to the discussion here, this probability was assumed independent of what other samplers did.<p>The software just brute-forces its way through all possible sampler networks.  One striking result from our (very simple) study case was that it often put two samplers in the same location.  This is a clear consequence of the principles laid out in the linked article.<p>For further info: Sohn and Lorenzetti, Risk Analysis, v.27 n.4 (2007), pp.877-886.",1257180898

917156,comment,916924,916924,0,0,btilly,,,"I've been on both sides of this situation.  I don't think there is a clear answer.<p>The fundamental problem is that interviews are a horrible way to select people.  There is little correlation between doing well in an interview and being capable at your job.  So in theory the more you make the interview be like the job, the more accurate an assessment it is.<p>For instance I have never seen an interview method produce better results when looking for a front end HTML person than giving them a picture of the page you want, giving them cutouts of all of the pieces they need, and asking them to write a web page that looks like that, will scale reasonably as you resize the browser, and with reasonably clean HTML.  Seriously, I've seen the results that this test produces, and invariably it gives you someone that can actually produce web pages.  Occasionally it lets someone with poor work ethic slip through, but that seems to be better than the alternative.  <i>Particularly</i> if the interviewer does not have the skillset you are looking to hire.<p>And then there is the time issue.  I have seen interviewing for a new person suck up top talent for weeks on end.  You need more resources, and you are losing proven, trained resources to do something they probably don't like!  Yet unless you can have someone with the skills you're hiring in the room, the interview process can't weed out people who don't have the right skills.  And as Joel's fizzbuzz test demonstrates, most candidates don't have the skills you need.<p>How bad is it?  Well Joel claims a significant portion of candidates can't write a program to count numbers, but with every multiple of 3 replaced by ""fizz"", every multiple of 5 by ""buzz"", and every multiple of 15 replaced by ""fizzbuzz"".  I believe it.  I have found that over 2/3 of candidates when given a double-loop to compute the intersection of 2 arrays can't figure out how to make it more efficient.  And good luck if you ask people to do something unusual like a depth-first traversal of a tree!<p>But there is a limit.  It is easy to produce a simple application that looks reasonable, but which takes a lot longer to put together than you think it will.  If you can't, knowing how it is supposed to go, personally do the exercise in an hour or two on a freshly set up machine, the exercise is too hard.  Personally I far prefer having a test with some simpler questions rather than a full blown mini-application.<p>But the opposite extreme of depending on interviews to filter out bad people is worse.  Much worse.",1257180638

(Simplifying a bit; said offspring should also reproduce, recursively, but it's a decent approximation to just consider offspring.) What kind of weird question is that?<p>In animals, yes. Humans, especially in affluent societies have more sophisticated goals. Obviously, reproduction is important, but we will also pursue irrational goals, such as self-realization, quality of life, love, ethics and so on. The idea that we consider it a virtue to raise a child with Asbergers syndrome or other genetic defects is evidence to that, and in an evolutionary context decidedly self-destructive.

917055,comment,915212,915212,0,0,jsensarma,,,"@everyone - thanks for all the comments. i have incorporated the multiple comments about the data loss scenario being incorrect when using vector clocks. i have been thinking too much about Cassandra lately - and it doesn't use vector clocks. that said - i continue to believe that returning stale reads is bad and best avoided and that unbounded stale-ness is not acceptable for many applications. To the extent that this is an avoidable scenario in a tightly coupled environment within a single data center - i consider it to be a significant drawback.<p>@jbellis - i hope the responses to your comment have convinced you about the problems with the dynamo quorum scheme/read-write protocols. i can convey that the problems i described definitely do exist in Cassandra. Jun Rao has made this point in the Cassandra public mailing lists a long time back and i have a pointer to the JIRA that he filed in my post as well.<p>regarding Dynamo being an interesting design space and for the academic community etc. That may very well have been the case - but the reality of the situation is that the world is now overflowing the Dynamo clones with people considering them for all kinds of usages. Hey - if it was good for Amazon (and Facebook and LinkedIn) - it's probably good for me! The people trying to use Dynamo clones do not understand all the small details. They don't understand what applications would be safe to write on it and which would not. I hope my posts (imperfect and opinionated undoubtedly) would provide a counterpoint to this sentiment and make users think harder and deeper before they make the leap.<p>i was also hoping to trigger a discussion (looks like i succeeded). i hope that it takes us to a better design space than what exists currently.",1257178756

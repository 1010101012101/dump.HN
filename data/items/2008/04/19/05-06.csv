167896,comment,167788,167836,0,0,indiejade,,,"Assuming that by ""skimp on"" you mean ""spend sparingly on a necessity,"" I'll preemptively refrain from rambling about what's probably not necessary for a tech startup.<p>Of course, one of my new hobbies, since making the voyage out here, has been to practice the wonderfully fun and interesting ""make vs buy"" comparison game.  You can, and probably will have many opportunities to play this game as a startup founder.  This game involves simply asking yourself and/or your team numerous questions of a basic logistical nature:<p>A)  How much does X cost to make, if I get to (or have to, depending on the day) make it myself? \nB)  How much does X cost to buy? \nC)  What are the costs, inclusive of shipping/assembly, for scenarios A and B?\nD)  Do I have anything that can be improvised or are there any possible substitutes that can serve the ultimate purpose of X (i.e. using a door as a desk) in the mean-time? \nE)  How long can I ""live"" with the improvised substitute or the idea of an improvised substitute?  \nF)  How much of the actual value of X is imagined; that is, how much have my perceptions been influenced by hype or advertising?<p>Questions E and F can get complicated, as they relate quite a bit back to the original posit about ""necessities"" and such.  Probably I'm too tired to go into them at the moment, so perhaps in the morning.<p>I therefore recommend being pretty weary of anything involving hidden ""lock-in"" costs resultant from usurping alternatives; for example, anything involving a contract probably fits into this category.<p>Regarding brand loyalty. . . remember that there's a big difference between purchasing actual quality and purchasing advertised ""quality.""  When factoring in costs associated with advertising, the make vs. buy comparison game really can take a person full circle.",1208584386

It's a private company that has found a way to make it dead simple for anyone to come along and make a social network of their own, what Movable Type did for blogging.<p>The article paints Ning as unstoppable, but if the parallel holds then the end I would foresee is the eventual arrival of an open source rival, a la what Wordpress brought to the blogging scene.

If you can live with svn, you'll find that its features are simple yet powerful (wiki, downloads page, svn browser, issues tracker). Another thing i like is that you can give admin/commit access to other Google accounts easily.<p>Launchpad is also a good alternative if your code is under a free license. You'll have the features of bzr, issues tracker and others, and if you're packing for Debian/Ubuntu, you can use Launchpad PPA to build your packages for 32 and 64 bit architectures for free.",1208582704

So we placed a bet, the one who loses most will win a bet.  He invited another fat friend. So three of us each put $500 into a envelope ($1,500 all in), and we had 6 weeks to lose as much as possible.  We weighed in immediately (3 times each, taking the average, very anal about the details).  6 weeks later one had lost 8lbs, one 20lbs and I lost 23lbs (I was completely dehydrated!), but we were skinny and I was rich.

Rest when you rest.  Play when you play.  If you're too unfocused to work, don't waste that time:  Rest instead and put the hours in when you're refreshed later.<p>Funding was easy enough:  Set aside as much as you can each month and invest it against the market index.  In a few years you'll have a nest egg which can see you through a good period of modest living without a single penny of revenue.  It really doesn't take a lot to support yourself if you focus on the essentials, and knowing you've a good buffer to see you through to profitability takes a lot of the pressure (and distraction) off of paying your bills.  Immodest living can come later -- you'll be too busy building up your business to live rich anyhow.<p>Business ideas were a snap:  They magically come while you're working for others (and building up your nest egg for self-funding).  Just pay attention to your surroundings and identify where there are unmet needs (those can often be measured by the volume of workplace profanity).

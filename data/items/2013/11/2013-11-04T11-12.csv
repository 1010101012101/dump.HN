6668082,comment,6667202,6667391,5,0,pavs,,,"My personal experience. There was a time in my life when the idea of having &quot;free time&quot; was a foreign concept to me. I took 12-14 credits in college, worked 60 hours (mostly graveyard shift), plus I had small online side projects (needed fair bit of time) which was making me $500/month and I was fairly busy socially and had a girlfriend. The commute to my work and to my school were both about 1 hour each (NYC subway) and most of time I would sleep in the train to make up for rest and would sometimes miss my stop. I did this for about 2.5 years (give or take).<p>Life was bit of a blur, so much was happening, so fast, it was hard to keep track of everything. But I LOVED it. I loved the rush, I loved having something to do all the time. I loved looking forward to vacation times dates or whatever leisure time I could squeeze in.<p>Now that I am older and have much more free time in my life, I am not even 1/10th as productive as I used to be.<p>Honestly given the choice I would gladly take a extremely busy life over all the free time I have right now.<p>Trust me I am not just sitting around with the all the free time I have. I try to take on projects, learn new things, take on difficult physical challenges (training for marathon), but its just not the same.",1383566314

Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute and receive a lot of backing and support from the institute and their extended network.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent\n    - have a good sense of humour\n    - be an amazing programmer\n    - wish to change the world\n</code></pre>\nOur system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past months we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.\nThe work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way.<p>We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose. \nOur team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2). We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.<p>We hope to hear from you.

6668070,comment,6667202,6668025,3,0,DanBC,,,"> In the UK we technically have a similar thing but the employee can voluntarily opt out.<p>There&#x27;s a maximum 48 hour work week, which the employee can opt out of.  That 48 hours is normally averaged over 17 weeks.  (I have no idea what happens if an employer tries to use median or modal instead of mean).  But the employee can not opt out of the other requirements.<p>The 48 hour maximum doesn&#x27;t cover people who control their own working hours (ie, start up founder); the armed forces, the police, and the emergency services, in some circumstances; domestic staff living in a household; some boat crew.<p>Trainee doctors used to be exempt.  They&#x27;re now covered, but averaged over 26 weeks.<p>Some staff are not allowed to opt out - airline pilots for example.<p>Workers can opt in and opt out of the arrangement, but they must give some notice if they had previously opted out and now want to opt in.<p>And all of this is for workers over the age of 18 - 16 and 17 year olds can only work for 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week with no averaging.<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours</a>",1383566098

I think I&#x27;ve deciphered your meaning now. You contend that a non-exploitative prison owner might earn such profits from non-exploitation that she would seek to increase the multitudes upon which she inflicts her non-exploitation.<p>This proposition has at least a couple of problems. First, a good measure of whether a practice is exploitative or not is whether people would freely choose it, so it&#x27;s a bad sign when your SOP requires locks on the cells. Second, from a purely commercial perspective, we would expect a &quot;just&quot; prison owner to be indifferent (in the long term) to how many are imprisoned. That is, she would charge society a suitable administration fee, and transfer most resources directly to the charges in her care. A &quot;kind&quot; prison owner would lose money on every prisoner, so she would actually lobby for fewer of them! Then we come to the sort of prison owners we actually have, and it&#x27;s no surprise they want to transform the nation itself into a vast prison.",1383566064

So would paying more to rent a one-bedroom apartment out there than I pay to mortgage my 4-bedroom detached house. As for &quot;trying both&quot;, I have. I did the internship rounds while in college. Spent 6 months on the west coast with Microsoft, and a year at two smaller companies, as a full-time software engineer.<p>There&#x27;s nothing about employment I miss. You could double the salary and I wouldn&#x27;t trade lives with an employee at any of those companies. I wake up in the morning without an alarm,  decide what I want to work on, program in my PJs, work as long as I care to, answer a few customer e-mails, and I&#x27;m done for the day. Some days I flip the schedule and shop/socialize/veg in the morning/afternoon, then work late at night. If I want a day or a month off, I just take it.<p>If I&#x27;m building something new, like the two months or so I spent on Improvely, I probably work about 4 hours a day, which is the most number of <i>productive</i> hours I ever got while working for someone else 8 hours a day. That&#x27;s 1300 hours a year of time wasted on commutes, meetings, endless e-mails, employee reviews, forced socialization with coworkers, and kissing up to managers so you rank well for bonuses and get better projects. Ugh.<p>There is one downside to what I do. I&#x27;m on call to keep the servers running 24/7. That means I pay for some monitoring that can SMS me if something fails, and I carry a Surface Pro in the trunk of my car so that even if I&#x27;m away from home I can get to a computer. It&#x27;s a once-a-year type responsibility. Had a hard drive crash in one server this year, and a power supply pooped out last year. Not a terrible burden.",1383565987

It just came out a few days ago. It speaks to a time period (70s) that I know little of; but the imagery is powerful and human emotions/relationships are so well expressed that you can feel the decade as you read. Brennan is true to her hippy voice - an authenticity so real that it stands in stark contrast to most modern narratives that you find in memoirs. It&#x27;s the first book I&#x27;ve read in years that I don&#x27;t want to put down.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this book to anyone without a very deep interest in Steve Jobs Studies.

That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really still missing in the field of Steve Jobs Studies We have some good general histories (Pirates, new movies, Apple books). We have some good personal narratives (Isaacson, Brennan, Wozniak&#x27;s iWoz, and Mona Simpson&#x27;s novel A Regular Guy which is well known to be about him and just an awesome book even if it weren&#x27;t). Yet the best business narrative we have other than magazine cover stories is probably Folklore.org and The Second Coming of Steve Jobs (Deutschman) which Steve himself called &quot;A Hatchet Job.&quot; It&#x27;s certainly an entertaining read (and it still makes an impression) but it doesn&#x27;t cover the important 2000s period, and it&#x27;s a bit too thin to really get into the sort of depth about NeXT, Pixar, and early days at Apple that the field needs.

Now anyone who searches for my email (on Google) is displayed a (spammy) link to the dumped file containing my email, along with some jumbled letters, possibly my encrypted password.<p>One super-good thing I did when I signed up for adobe was:<p>I created a separate email address (purely by co-incidence) that I used exclusively for Adobe (and for some spammy services like some deal sites, which didn&#x27;t require my card). As a result, I know for sure that my card was compromised because of the Adobe&#x27;s breach and no one else.<p>Lessons and observations:<p>1) I&#x27;m glad I bought the CS6. With the cloud comes great risks too. Not to say that you should avoid cloud products, but when you have a version you can own forever, then you might as well go for it. Imagine if I was on CC and my card was hacked and I decided to stop paying Adobe the next month out of frustration. Do you know what will happen? My company will come to a stand-still because I will no longer have access to Photoshop and a huge portion of my company is basically a Media company.<p>2) Someone else said we&#x27;re depending too much on Adobe, and I tend to agree. But there is really no superior equivalent for Adobe&#x27;s Photoshop at the moment. Please don&#x27;t cite GIMP - I&#x27;ve tried it and it needs a lot of work to even be on par with Photoshop atm. Another factor is the PSD file format which has painfully spread like a Virus and you can&#x27;t erase it out of your workflow if you&#x27;re a Media shop like us (Most printing services accept PSDs/TIFF). I sincerely wish why YC companies who generally want to change the world, don&#x27;t want to create a Photoshop clone/competitor to kill this stupid Adobe that&#x27;s ruining all of our lives with the stupid CC bundle.<p>3) The people who really won, like someone else said, were the ones who used pirated versions. I mean, I&#x27;ve paid a total of ~$1400 till now to Adobe and what have I received from Adobe? A &#x27;fuck you&#x27; from their CEO in the form of their Creative cloud bundle and a hack that leaked my personal details online making me look like a jack ass to anyone who searches for me by my email. Oh also don&#x27;t forget the uncounted number of &quot;fuck you&#x27;s&quot; he&#x27;s sent me while developing for Flash (on mobile) and Flex.<p>4) Always create a separate email (or an alias) while signing up for cloud services, so you can eliminate guess work during a crisis. So, instead of signing up with example@gmail.com for Adobe or someone else, use example+adobe@gmail.com (this will  redirect to example@gmail.com) or rather create adobe.example@gmail.com or something (gmail is just an example). This way, you can always trace out the right service  responsible for the leakage of your details whenever something goes wrong.<p>I was lucky enough that my bank blocked my card on observing a fraudulent transaction initiated from another country and thus issued me with a new card. I have no plans to upgrade from CS6 or to something else for the next few years. Hopefully GIMP will get better by then, or some YC company will create a better Photoshop and let us own it forever for a one-time fee.",1383565041

And unless you&#x27;re running a very unusual, top-end restaurant, that&#x27;s a matter of a couple of months&#x27; work every year, at absolute maximum - closer to a couple of weeks a year for most normal restaurants, I believe.<p>Of course, some cooking tasks are going to be harder than others. I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet on a top-flight pastry chef getting replaced any time soon, for example. But creeping automation in the kitchen is definitely a possibility: sous-vide techniques can already make things like preparing a hollandaise considerably quicker and simpler, for example. And baristas are staring down the barrel of robot barista workers right now.",1383562828

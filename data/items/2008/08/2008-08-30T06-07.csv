But what is the guaranty they will still be supported after 20-25 years when we actually need it? Just the way floppy disks and various other storage devices are dead today USB or timecapsule may be dead soon. What is the best way to take backup of those precious moments then? Have you faced similar situation? or am I thinking too out of the box?",1220079261

What other websites do you go to for these kinds of discussions, particularly on non-hacker topics? Like most people here I'm interested in various areas -- technology, economics, politics, psychology, and mathematical modeling of all kinds --  and enjoy discussing them with other analytically/quantitatively minded people.<p>Some blogs, such as Freakonomics, Marginal Revolution, and Overcoming Bias have interesting commenters. Metafilter is full of smart people, but is a bit too heavy on the arts & humanities for my taste. Apart from HN, where do you get your fix for smart discussion?",1220077871

Proprietary software, especially where much of the code is intentionally user-hostile (DRM, etc), is the enemy. There's absolutely nothing ignoble about a forensic investigator or librarian, roles which encompass much of what I see as reverse engineering.<p>Also, it's fun and educational.

That's what following rules is. The shallow (easily observed) lie that those who wrote the laws knew enough to do so (more than we do now), and the sociopathy to ignore the circumstances and damn people based on cold unreasoning laws.<p>It takes a caring and empathic human to evaluate a situation and say the rules are for shit.

While that is a safe assumption, a hacker mind would just consider the locked door as one particular blocked entry to the house and hop in through the basement window that was left slightly open. It might not be too relevant for him whether the premises themselves are, or are not, off limits: the hacker mind would realize that him looking around the house doesn't cause any tangential damage to anything, but at least he would satisfy his endless curiosity about what's inside.<p>Similarly this shoe guy realized it does no harm to anyone and nobody would actually care if he posed as a film crew even if they weren't filming anything.

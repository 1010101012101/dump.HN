If this Swift Transportation company which is featured in the article wanted to avoid a 20% decline in their share price, they merely had to walk into the break room at the competing trucking company and offer $10,000 spot bonuses to switch companies.  Boom.  Elastic.<p>Anyway, Swift&#x27;s annual report says that driver wages as a fraction of revenue have fallen in each of the last two years, so it&#x27;s their own fault if they came up short on drivers.",1407628783

In that situation, paying more won&#x27;t help any shortage. And some jobs that you would think are elastic in the long term aren&#x27;t as much as you might think: the majority of people may simply be unable to perform the job, or uncertainties about the job&#x27;s existence in four years might mean the expected return of training is very low or negative.<p>If people are not sanguine about the existence of trucking jobs 10 years from now, it&#x27;s no surprise that the actual supply of labor is very low and not looking to expand soon. If you&#x27;re an employer, you&#x27;re probably best off using your monopsonist position to drive down wages of the current supply instead of paying handsome sums to coax people into taking big risks in preparing and dedicating themselves to your jobs.

It concerns itself with ensuring that everyone has the same definition of measuring units.  For a long time, the yard was based on physical standards. i.e. Somewhere there sat a physical rod 1 yard long that all other rods were measured against to define the yard.  The meter was defined this way until 1960 too.  The unfortunate problem with physical standards is that they change.  A physical rod is different lengths at different temperatures and will, of course, gradually get shorter as it&#x27;s handled and wear occurs on its ends.<p>The meter is now defined in terms of how fast light can travel in a given period of time.  That period of time is defined in terms of hyperfine ground state level transitions of a Cesium atom. Yes, it&#x27;s complex.  However, while a physical standard changes, these standards are built into the laws of the universe and are thus reproducible and fixed for all time. <i>For this reason, the yard is currently defined as 0.9144 meters in the U.S.. No matter how the metric system defines the meter, a yard is 0.9144 meters.</i><p>So, the U.S. really has gone metric, at least where it counts.  The average American is just ignorant of the fact.<p>P.S. Even the metric system is not completely free of physical definitions... yet.  The kilogram is still based on a physical prototype.  However, there are proposals to change that to something based on physical constants.  Once this is done, the metric system will be defined entirely in terms of physics.",1407626334

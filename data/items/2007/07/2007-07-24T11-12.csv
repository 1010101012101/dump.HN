If you have the luxury of not having to work, great otherwise you might want to add consulting in there in order to gain some real world experience while plugging those holes on your resume.  If you can't find consulting work then transition some of that ""brainstorming for project"" into volunteer or internship work in a larger shop to gain experience.

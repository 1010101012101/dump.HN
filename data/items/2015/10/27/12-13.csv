Or, to be more precise, which papers are &quot;needlessly complex&quot;, and which ones are &quot;justified complex&quot;? FTA:<p>> Bosley (...) says that academic prose is often so riddled with professional jargon and needlessly complex syntax that even someone with a Ph.D. can’t understand a fellow Ph.D.’s work unless he or she comes from the very same discipline.<p>That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the article is &quot;needlessly complex&quot;, it could also mean that the article deals with a complex topic, and therefore will be complex to read if you are not up to date with the topic. An article that makes no previous assumptions is ultimately called a book, and runs hundreds of pages long, as opposed to an 8-pages scientific article. Or, to make an analogy, it&#x27;s not intended to be the full source code but a diff to previous research.<p>Of course, there is some bad writing around (like the IG Nobel prize, where students use longer words just because they can). But to claim that it makes for a majority of writing seems to me like a stretch.",1445950793

There are many classes on this (albeit from professional-level degrees) and it&#x27;s all based on public statutes and court cases.

I&#x27;m a tax attorney, I understand these deals, and I can explain them rather well so even someone unfamiliar with tax law will understand it. However, it still does take a bit of active listening on behalf of an unfamiliar (as in, unfamiliar with tax law) listener to actually understand what I&#x27;m talking about, regardless of how much I simplify it.&quot;</i><p>The most disappointing thing about international tax is how little even professional journalists understand it, or care to.

This is a very useful base for all kinds of NNs but also for any mathematical models. This will give you a computation graph which is then also optimized by Theano and which can be evaluated on several different backends, e.g. CUDA, i.e. it can be calculated on the GPU. This is also important for common NNs for performance.<p>Torch (Lua) is similar, but is not symbolic, and when you want to calculate the gradient, it will do the backpropagation through the same graph, just backwards. It&#x27;s like Theano only a mathematical framework, which is very useful for all kinds of NNs but also any other mathematical models.<p>There are many libs based on Theano, e.g. like Groundhog, Keras, Lasagne, etc. There are also Torch based NN utils.

In addition, the\n  analysis revealed that Regin is apparently an attack\n  platform that can be used by several different institutions\n  in several different countries. Kaspersky published its\n  findings in a blog post on Tuesday.\n\n  The new analysis provides clear proof that Regin is in fact\n  the cyber-attack platform belonging to the Five Eyes\n  alliance, which includes the US, Britain, Canada, Australia\n  and New Zealand. Neither Kaspersky nor Symantec commented\n  directly on the likely creator of Regin. But there can be\n  little room left for doubt regarding the malware&#x27;s origin.\n\n  The source code excerpt published by SPIEGEL comes straight\n  from the Snowden archive.\n  \n  Regin was also apparently involved in the attack on the\n  Belgian telecommunications firm Belgacom. And Belgacom, as\n  SPIEGEL reported in the summer of 2013, was a target of the\n  British intelligence agency GCHQ. Ronald Prins, head of the\n  Dutch security company Fox IT, which analyzed the attack on\n  Belgacom, told SPIEGEL ONLINE in the summer of 2011 that\n  Regin appeared to be a tool belonging to the NSA and GCHQ.\n\n  There are also additional clues pointing to Regin being a\n  Five Eyes tool:\n\n  - In the QWERTY code, there are numerous references to\n  cricket, a sport that enjoys extreme popularity in the\n  Commonwealth.\n  \n  - There are many similarities with the cyber-weapons system\n  that the intelligence agencies call &quot;Warriorpride&quot; in the\n  Snowden documents.\n  \n  - The targets thus far known are consistent with Five Eyes\n  surveillance targets as outlined in the Snowden documents.\n  \n  A serious cyber-attack on the European Commission in 2011.\n  The deputy head of Germany&#x27;s Federal Office for Information\n  Security, Andreas Könen, told SPIEGEL at the end of last\n  December that, &quot;we have reconstructed that; there are clear\n  congruencies.&quot;\n  \n  The Austrian newspaper Der Standard, citing anonymous\n  sources, reported last November that malware code from the\n  Regin family had been found in the network of the\n  International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna.\n  Germany&#x27;s Bild newspaper also reported a Regin infection in\n  the computer of a member of the department for European\n  affairs in Angela Merkel&#x27;s Chancellery. According to the\n  paper, the malware was found on the woman&#x27;s private\n  computer. The Federal Office for Information Security says\n  that Regin has not yet been found on official German\n  government computers.\n  \n  It seems likely that more Regin discoveries will be made.\n  Kaspersky alone, says Raiu, has found the malware in\n  computers belonging to 27 international companies,\n  governments and private persons.</code></pre>",1445950381

Both dirty checking and Virtual DOM are pull-based mechanisms - i.e. nothing happens when the state itself changes, you have to give the system a signal to pull and apply. This means when manipulating externalized state you need to hold a reference to all the components that are interested in it, or do it by registering events - which is why the original Flux is unnecessarily complex.

When wondering how the enourmous losses came about, remember:<p>- the Grande Armee was walking from Paris to Moscow, and quartering in the field along the way.<p>- the army was fed (as routine for all pre-railway armies) by local looting.<p>- the Russian response to this was to burn everything in the path of the advancing army that they might capture or make use of. This rendered the original plan to spend the winter in Moscow impossible.<p>A large fraction of the army starved, as was to happen later to the German 6th Army at Stalingrad. Or froze due to lack of available fuel. Or slipped away in the night to forage and never came back.",1445947949

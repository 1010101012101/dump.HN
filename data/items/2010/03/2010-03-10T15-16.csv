If the interviewer doesn't take this into account (and few do), the interview becomes little more than a random, high-pass screen, wherein lots of smart people are eliminated from positions based on bad luck, and little else.<p>Joel (on Software) has it right, but it seems like few people are listening:  you want to make sure the candidate is <i>smart</i>, and can <i>get things done</i>.  That's it.  The goal is not to see if they're the next human incarnation of Alan Turing, and it's certainly not to see if they can derive fiendishly difficult algorithms during a whiteboard lecture (call me crazy, but I'm reasonably sure that Turing didn't come up with his theories while talking continuously in front of a whiteboard, while some asperger-y geek sneered at him from across the room.)<p>When you're interviewing, you want to make sure that the candidate can write code, that they're reasonably smart, and (IMHO) that they're not an asshole.  It seems to me that our industry has taken ""coding puzzle"" and turned it into ""crappy intelligence test"", while largely ignoring the ""not an asshole"" part of the equation -- the part that's usually the most important in real life.",1268234947

Is the fact that non-agile workers can always fall back on retail jobs good enough?</i><p>First step, since we'll need to go there anyway: half of all economic growth goes into a basic income fund that <i>everyone</i> gets; no strings, no questions, given to rich and poor alike. Asymptotically, this means that no one will have less than a 1/2<i>N share. Eventually, we'll be able to get rid of other entitlement programs once this basic income fund is sufficient to eliminate poverty.<p>We're destined for sub-20% </i>employment* in 50-200 years. The best we'll be able to achieve is a state where most of those who are unemployed are studying up for their next career. This eliminates the ""fall behind"" problem. People fall behind today because they still have to work when they do, often in more taxing jobs than we work (retail sucks). So they have no energy to push forward.<p>Second, we'll need to improve human intelligence either through ""transhuman"" advancement or eugenics ^. Not to sound like a dick, but a lot of people are ""falling behind"" on technology because they aren't smart enough. It's not that they are lazy or disadvantaged, but that the skills required to master advanced technology weren't necessary throughout most of our evolutionary history and are therefore uncommon.<p>^ On ""eugenics"", please understand that I'm not excusing the horrors that have been given that name (a misapplication thereof) in the past. I'm not advocating harming anyone, but I think there should be strong incentives (e.g. free education) for smart people to reproduce.",1268234859

He calls C++ : &quot;feature adding contest&quot;.&quot;<p>Adding the capability to utilize more degrees of freedom into a system does not mean one is compulsed to use all of those. One of the pitfalls of C++ is that people imagine they must write &quot;idiomatic&quot; C++ - which they understand is that they must use every language feature available. Which is idiotic.

C/C++ lets you go as close to hardware as you would possibly want. Want SIMD? Easy. Want custom memory allocation (a big deal if you allocate/deallocate a ton)? Sure, why not. Want to profile and optimize cache locality and memory layout? Knock yourself out. Memory alignment? Yup. Branch hints? Of course. I could continue with this, but as someone who has written performance-sensitive code you already know most if not all of this. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that e.g. high performance linear algebra libs are written in C.<p>Which you can use in Python. I&#x27;m a C guy myself, but this bullshit &quot;do it all in C&quot; attitude needs to be calmed down a bit.

Please bear with me here, as I&#x27;m not as technically skilled as the average HN user.<p>On your first sentence, is the issue that some fundamental aspect of the SGX security model requires copying data in/out of enclaves, which would make direct computation on data stored in remote memory impossible?<p>And breaking your second sentence into two parts:<p>(1) That does seem to be the present state of affairs. From what I can gather, RDMA and low-latency networking is expensive due to the high cost of interconnect/cabling and switching infrastructure. So atm RDMA is exclusively used in HPC clusters and as backplane interconnect between server blades/racks. But I wonder if this will always be the case. Take cabling for example. Retail SFP+ optical interconnect is crazy expensive for even very short runs. If this is because production costs are high by nature, then I&#x27;d agree that LL networking and RDMA will remain confined to the server room. But if there are significant unrealised production economies of scale, or there are achievable advances in production techniques that will reduce costs, then deployment at the network edge might be economically feasible once we pass some level of demand/adoption.<p>2) On low-latency RDMA not being as powerful as I think: This might be because of my limited understanding. From what I understand, LL RDMA would allow a whole bunch of computers to be abstracted as a single &#x27;super computer&#x27;: the inter-memory-processor latency is so low that it makes this abstraction possible. Have I misunderstood the technology? (genuine question)",1454309492

Why should I have to worry about my memory allocation when I&#x27;m trying to do a bunch of statistical tests on data? Not to mention that I can do endless monkeypatching in Python safely, while in C you&#x27;d be trying to modify code (which modern kernels don&#x27;t like).<p>Most performance problems come from bad algorithms, not your programming language. I had a piece of code that had to do some complicated &quot;image&quot; masking with a 2 array, with feathering and some quite complicated statistical modelling to compute the offset.

Hedge funds <i>borrow</i> and create temporary money by writing derivative contracts such as options, futures & swaps. It is by this logic they can actually muster more funds than the PBOC in aggregate. Quite simply the market for currencies is bigger than the PBOC and the hedge funds, but there are more hedge funds that are richer than the 3T in reserves the PBOC has access to.<p>This is partly why the PBOC uses the overnight rate to limit resources (such as to affect the interest rate of the derivatives instead of the Yuan prices they bear). It would be possible to profit by arbitraging the interest rate so this would make using derivatives expensive too.<p>Of course affecting interest rates affects the entire economy as a whole and is unsustainable.",1454309421

Why generalize from that sample?  Why ignore all those contributions to the Linux kernel or Fedora, OpenStack or Kubernetes, gcc or coreutils?  Some pretty good leaders in there.  And if &quot;creating leaders&quot; is supposed to be how we judge companies, what should we make of much larger companies where few employees engage with the community at all?  I don&#x27;t even mean unpopular companies like Microsoft or Oracle.  What about Google, for example, or Apple?  When it comes to community leadership, they&#x27;re net negatives; existing leaders go in, and are never heard from again.

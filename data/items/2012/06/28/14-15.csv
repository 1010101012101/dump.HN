4171939,comment,4170837,4170891,1,0,rayiner,,,"I don't think the first comment is particularly controversial, though the speaker was being diplomatic in his use of the term ""innovate."" It makes more sense if you replace it with ""rip off.""<p>The fact of the matter is that a lot of people paint this idealized picture of the morally virtuous techie, where the only people who own patents are big bad patent trolls, and the only people who get sued are innocent innovators who independently arrive at an invention.<p>That's not the actual story, or at least that's not the whole story. Like in every other field, there is a gaussian distribution of business ethics at various companies. Look at how many companies get nailed for using GPL-ed software without releasing source. You think those same companies don't also copy competitors' designs wholesale? When our company was doing business with an American telecoms supplier, a manager there mentioned that a Chinese telecoms supplier was ripping off their designs wholesale, down to the silk-screening on the PCBs.<p>There is a difference between ""let's innovate on top of this idea"" and ""oh this idea is good, let's just copy it.""<p>Now, NPE's in their current form are clearly just rent-seeking. However, I think there is a role for NPE's that create value by serving to create a market for patents. Not every innovator wants to get into the business of making products. ARM wants to design microprocessors, they don't want to design and manufacture iPads. Patents facilitate that division of labor, and NPE's can make the whole system more efficient by creating markets for patents.",1340895008

The word is probably the most used word in the crisis, which is never explained by facts. What are those ""punitive austerity measures""? This is not a rhetoric question, I'd like to know.<p>Germany (and others, Netherlands, Finland etc.) want taxes to be paid (could end the crisis real quick) and structural reforms to prevent bottomless pits and enable growth in the future.<p>Greece was not able to take 15 billions EUR over the last years of infrastructure money from the European Union because of a local administration that just does not work and is extremely corrupt. The European Union was supporting Greece growth with money for innovation projects, infrastructure money etc. over the last decade, but Greece was not able to run the necessary projects.<p>I was managing European IT projects 10 years ago. Poland did show how to take EU money and prosper. They were on EVERY IT project I was part of, payed every company and university that took EU money additional money, helped get projects into Poland etc. They did everything right, now - and it was of course not only EU money but a very strong spirit and enthusiasm in Poland - they prosper from what they did since they joined the EU (and before).<p>The crisis is kind of sad for Greece, because their productivity grew strongly in the last 10 years (contrary to Spain or Italy) and the crisis is often attributed to ""lazy"" Greeks.",1340895004
4171937,comment,4170474,4170474,2,0,sophacles,,,"I like mustache a lot. Particularly because it just works for every language I use, and a huge number of the languages I might use. But it does have pain points (lots of little templates, weird include behavior, some uneccessary repetition, etc).<p>I don't think that adding logic, filters, etc explicitly to the templates is the right answer. Such things tend to accelerate and encourage big ball of mud apps (in my experience ymmv). It also makes it harder to have a consistent cross-platform experience. I really think a better solution might be to have a simple callback mechanism. So for instance, a tag:<p><pre><code>   {{*foo}}\n</code></pre>\nWould result in the renderer looking in the context dictionary for a key ""foo"". If the value for that key is callable, it calls the function (with the context dictionary as an argument), and replaces the tag with the return string of the function.<p>That's it. This can mitigate many of the pain points of the templates, while still making consistent implementations across languages easy.<p>It is still a bit tricky in the ""templates are the same on client and server"" case, because then you need to implement a function twice (potentially), but I think I would rather do that than descend into some of the templates with logic horrors I've seen (and written myself sadly).",1340894998

As a result it can't be used again to decide if the transcription fits the model; it's the case by design. There must be some kind of confidence metric at the end of the process, but I don't think it's possible to tell how much of the ambiguity comes from inadequacies in the phoneme model, or the audio environment, or the language model. They'd have to throw out good transcriptions in noisy environments along with bad transcriptions, and probably wouldn't keep much at all.

Right now I personally see patent trolling as a tax (collected by some really murky individuals) on innovation, a neo-liberalist would perhaps see it as the market promoting patented innovations over non-patented innovations or innovations without ""good"" protection - thereby making the individual with a ""good"" protection an advantage. I think even a neo-liberalist could see that as positive. I'm however not a neo-liberalist (fuck, I'm a Swede we're pretty much communists anyway?) so I can only see this as a tax on innovation, but the point I was trying to make and still stick by is that if patents are so ""worthless""/""weak"" then why can someone make a buck out of them, aren't patents then more misunderstood than ""worthless""/""weak""?",1340894932

Once you take a normal infant car seat and reverse it, and the front passenger (or driver) legroom completely disappears unless you're driving a minivan or an SUV.<p>Three years ago, the guidance was to keep the infant car seat rear facing until age 1. Then it became until the child reaches 20 lbs. Now the guidance is to push to age 2 with the additional recommendations to go even longer if possible.<p>I believe that the proliferation of side impact rear airbags has forced the safety guidelines in this direction. Side impact rear airbags are a great safety feature for adults, but they can be fatal to small children. A car seat is the only real defense you have against them. And the manufacturers aren't taking chances with letting the airbags be disabled based on weight requirements.<p>Nobody likes to take chances with their kids, but we've also gone a little nuts with safety in the US, using ""bigger is better"" to handle every safety issue and with all sides so worried about getting sued that we've created this unsustainable escalation of safety features in cars.<p>This has the net effect of keeping us in larger cars for longer and preying on our emotions to keep us from switching to more practically sized vehicles.

I was back and forth with just getting a standard run of the mill b&w Brother Laser (on Amazon for $50 or so) and something a little more robust. The HP Envy caught my eye. I had seen one in a big box store in Manhattan for about $100 more than they were going for on Amazon (cost me $160) and was impressed with the look and quality. I decided to go for it. It came in the mail this morning and I will say I am very impressed so far. It looks great, the paper is hidden, the UI is very sleek, it reacts quickly to touch and does everything you'd expect. The only issue I'd say with the UI was that they ask you to program in the date & time when they could easily get that information a couple steps later once you're on wifi. It's also the quietest printer I've used so far. It was printing a test sheet and I literally didn't even know it was printing.<p>Anyway long story short I just basically had given up on HP's (or really anyone's) ability to make a quality printer that didn't drive me insane when trying to operate it.

With that being said, it's easiest to compare apples to apples, so why not compare developers :)<p>I'd also love to know what you think.<p>Questions, comments, and feedback are welcome :)<p>Looking forward to seeing some of you!",1340893928

Still its coarse motor control instead of fine motor, which is less tedious.</i><p>Yeah, I'd be shocked if this replaces the scroll wheel. I can see a few ways it might complement existing input devices, though. One is for maybe a dozen intuitive, system-wide shortcuts. Like ""if I stick out two fingers and twitch to the right within six inches of the screen, and I'm not in a touch-enabled app, switch to the next song."" (This takes too long to say -- try doing it.) Or, ""if I make the classic 'stop' hand gesture within six inches of the screen, stop playing music."" This may not sound like much, but imagine a random non-geeky user is playing music in the background and gets a phone call and wants to pause. I bet 25% or less of users use a system-wide shortcut for that. I bet 75% or more would intuitively remember and use the ""stop"" gesture if you showed it to them once.<p>A second use case is collaboration. Someone comes into my office and I turn my screen around and show them a map of a given facility we're working on. (This happens a couple times a week.) They want to zoom out a little and see what's to the west of the facility. Instead of asking me to do that, they just reach in and do it with gestures. They don't think about it, it just works.<p>The third use case is all those things we do with our hands in real life that there's no analog for on the computer. Like, say, oil painting. Or conducting. Or playing rock-paper-scissors. Or air guitar. Or juggling. Or ping pong. There are a million things we do that involve <i>holding something in the air and using it to cause some effect on the world</i>, with little or no direct physical feedback. There are a million more that we haven't thought of yet because they're not physically possible (but they will be virtually possible).<p>I'm pretty excited about this.",1340893923

We're seeing this more and more with tighter integrations between major google products, but I feel this goes above and beyond what we've traditionally seen from Google in terms of habit-building.<p>A personal example: I fly a few times a year, and I always check my flight status at the specific airline's website.  I haven't really looked into other options because I've held a ""if it ain't broken, don't fix it"" attitude, and it is a simple enough task.  But if I were to use an app like this, suddenly I have a huge added incentive to search for my flight statuses on google.<p>I don't mean to imply that this is a bad thing.  To the contrary, I think it is a smart business decision that adds a lot of value to all of the integrated google products for the user.  I just found it interesting when I was trying to decide what the ""value"" was to google for a product like this.",1340892159

The tool itself encourages this, so instead of adapting to it, for some people it's best to not use it.<p>It's like eating at a fast food restaurant. Yes, you can adapt to it and order the salads, and healthy dishes.. But noone's forcing you to go there, you can just not go to them in the first place.",1340892078

To provide an alternative (and equally useless) anecdote, the older I get, the more I prefer GPL licenses (to the extent that I used to be adamant about ""freedoms"" and such, licensing all of my code as BSD, and then I ran through series of life situations dealing with, as far as I can tell, similar issues to those I hear Stallman had, and now I license everything I do under GPL3: for similar reasons I have come to understand the role of governments, why insurance works the way it does, and in general have become less libertarian); this is a pattern I have seen in others as well: I might argue that the GPL is something you come to later, after you've seen a glimpse of the world of software without it.",1340892037

6311098,comment,6310555,6310555,11,0,betterunix,,,"I think Common Lisp has a good approach with its restarts system.  I try to write something to a file but there is not a enough disk space?  How about telling the user, then invoking a restart when the user says, &quot;There is more space available!&quot; and continuing execution as if nothing went wrong?  The problem with exceptions is that there is no way to recover from them in most languages, because the exception handler is found by unwinding the stack.<p>What I do not like about the &quot;check return values&quot; approach is:<p>1. It means that client code must understand how to handle error conditions.  No disk space?  Well whoever called the top-level function that invoked <i>write</i> needs to figure out what to do if there is any chance of recovery.  It is a maintenance headache that can quickly accumulate bugs.<p>2. In both Java and C++ there are functions that cannot return values:  constructors, and in C++ destructors.  No, it is not acceptable for a program to crash just because a constructor call failed.  No, it is not any better to have every class have a special variable that indicates that the constructor failed.  No, having empty constructors is not the answer, and it is certainly not going to help with destructor calls (the C++ standard library actually requires some destructors to silently fail because of the issues with error reporting).",1378054787

6311089,comment,6306906,6307878,1,0,mortehu,,,"> If every major problem in the United States were already solved, it would be more reasonable to then try to help others solve their problems.<p>> If you have people suffering right in front of you, it just makes sense logistically to help them first.<p>> there isn&#x27;t any sane reason why an American would prioritize the needs of another country before his own<p>You&#x27;re making several statements basically asserting that proximity is the only relevant factor when determining how easy it is to help one person or grow an economy.  But we&#x27;re not all paramedics.  I&#x27;d argue that the American economy has already grown so much, and people are already given so many opportunities here, that making improvements here is going to be way more expensive in terms of natural resources and manpower, than improving an area where much simpler problems are still unsolved.<p>For example, spending $1M fighting malaria in Africa improves the GDP of Africa by $12M.[1]<p>> Helping our own homeless and unemployed would aid in stimulating the American economy.<p>This seems to be evidence of national bias.

We&#x27;re a humanoid robotics research laboratory, we have a fairly large and old codebase for what we do (~1MLOC of Java, plus a whole big whack of C++ for JNI), and since we neither have a customer nor an OSS community then we make no guarantees about our API nor do we frequently generate stable, frozen binary releases.  As such, the code is <i>constantly</i> being refactored and evolving; especially our numerical based stuff; things like physics, controls, etc. (we use an in-house simulation environment that one of our PI&#x27;s created while he was in grad school, so even stuff like the 3D engine or the simulator data viz GUI&#x27;s can change at any given moment).<p>I realize that this is entirely anecdotal and highly specific to what we do, but without high coverage and solid CI (We use a self-hosted Bamboo instance with nightly and every-commit builds), our code would be in complete and utter disarray.  The build routinely breaks a dozen times a day when one of the control theory guys checks in a parameter tweak to our state estimator or introduces a new component to one of our modular controllers (we have test suites that actually run headless versions of our sims and mathematically verify the walking behavior).<p>I guess my point is that, as is the case with <i>anything</i> in programming, choose the right tool for the job.  Evaluate what you&#x27;re doing, what your goals are, the nature of your code-base, and decide (as is brushed over in the source article) whether or not the opportunity cost is worth it.  For us, we&#x27;d be up shit creek if we didn&#x27;t have high coverage.",1378054604

6311051,comment,6306795,6307558,2,0,robomartin,,,"> Why did you take a deal where you took such a risk with such a limited return?<p>Gross margins were far greater than what I quoted.  The number I quoted was what I realistically thought we could keep if all went well (defined as &quot;normal&quot;).  Also, remember that you don&#x27;t get to keep all the money you make, you have to slice off a good chunk and hand it off to the government.  This is another area where a $2.5 million dollar sale is not a &quot;we are swimming in cash&quot; situation.  Don&#x27;t get me started on that one.<p>The other reason was:  2008.  The economy took a dive.  In a lot of industry segments orders evaporated from the books within one quarter.  It was a do or die situation.  In all honesty, I was looking down the barrel of an ugly gun.  I was facing having to lay off a significant number of people.  So I did what a CEO has to do under those circumstances.  I took off my engineer hat and hit the road to sell, sell, sell.  The result is that I landed a nice contract.  The bad news is that buyers knew that they could extract very good deals during this weird time when everyone was hurting.  In other words, as a seller you had limited leverage.  Margins had to be tightened in order to get the deal.  Plain and simple.  Sometimes your choices are very limited.<p>> Was that your best option to keep the company going?<p>At the time, yes.  There was nothing else in the horizon of the right scale.  It would be a year (2010) before I saw an opportunity of that scale come across my table.<p>> Maybe I&#x27;m hopelessly naive, but would that deal have been impossible to make on terms where the client paid the majority of those up-front costs.<p>Well, I asked for 100% payment upfront.  There was no way I could close that deal.  Not even 50/50.  It ended up being four 25% installments which, under normal circumstances, isn&#x27;t bad at all.  If you consider supply chain lead times and supplier credit terms (which I negotiated to 90 days in some cases) this would work out fine if all went according to plans.<p>I did not have the luxury of acting in consideration of payments not arriving on time without being dishonest.  What I mean by this is that I could have waited until at least two payments were in the bank before issuing PO&#x27;s and getting ready to manufacture.  This would mean that I would most-definitely not deliver on time.  I would have to lie about delivering on time in the interest of ensuring that at least half the cash was in the bank.  This could setup a whole array of situations when deliveries end-up delayed by a month or two.  I chose to be honest and pull the trigger right away.  Bad decision?  From hindsight, yes.  At the moment the right thing to honor a commitment to deliver on time.<p>> and thus not half-killing their supplier!<p>I found that people don&#x27;t generally think this way.  I&#x27;ve had customers knowingly support my efforts because they liked the direction I was taking.  Even though they were paying more and had to wait for the results they&#x27;d still support me.  That is a microscopic portion of the TAM.  A few people counted with one hand.  The more likely scenario is that people want it for as little as they can get it.  Period.  At one point I chose to highlight the fact that our products were US designed and manufactured.  The effort failed to produce any measurable sales above the noise floor.  People don&#x27;t think that way.  They&#x27;d happily buy the cheaper Chinese alternative and don&#x27;t think about the fact that, in doing so, are contributing to the slow destruction of the local manufacturing base.  Ultimately you, as a CEO, are forced into an &quot;if you can&#x27;t beat them, join them&quot; situation.  I really rubs me the wrong way when I hear people talk about how companies are taking jobs to China because they are greedy.  Thinking like that only reveals deep ignorance.<p>> I&#x27;m a new CEO: please help me learn from your experience!<p>Talk to people who actually run businesses.  For the most part ignore those who do not.  I say &quot;for the most part&quot; because I have long time friends who have always served as a &quot;bring balance to the force&quot; input, particularly during tough times.  However, these people are few and far between and, in my experience, you&#x27;ve known them for quite some time.  A lot of the people posting on sites like HN have never even run a cookie baking operation yet think they understand business.<p>To that end I&#x27;d be more than happy to speak to you off-list.  My email is in my profile.<p>If you are a technical CEO (EE or CS major) I&#x27;d urge you to put a lot of time into understanding business.  If you can, enroll in an MBA program.  MBA&#x27;s are, in my opinion, useless without context.  However, if you do have context --for example, you are an EE and have experience in the industry you are addressing-- an MBA can probably save you from lots of pain and suffering.  I wish someone had pushed me in that direction.<p>Beyond that, at some level nobody can teach you everything you need to learn.  You have to hold the cat by the tail [1].<p>Learn to sell and market.  It&#x27;s an art.  And you&#x27;ll need to know how to do it with your eyes closed if things ever go bad.  Selling isn&#x27;t sitting at a desk waiting for phone calls or emails.  It&#x27;s a contact sport.  It&#x27;s finding business rather than business finding you.  Very important.  The &quot;Little Red Book of Selling&quot; [2] is one of a possible range of books you could use to get started.<p>[1] Mark Twain: &quot;A man holding a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way&quot;<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Little-Red-Book-Selling-Principles/dp/1885167601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Little-Red-Book-Selling-Principles/dp/...</a>",1378054172

However, apparent color differences are a highly non-linear property, and so by the point E gets past 5 or 10, a specific color difference in one direction or one part of the color space will be substantially different than a same-distance color difference in another part of the space.<p>Often, the reason you want to carefully pick a color scheme is to make sure that two areas of a graphic are easily visually distinguishable along an edge. Because human vision mainly uses a monochromatic color signal for distinguishing shape, texture, and the finest details, the most important difference to make between a pair or set of colors is to separate them in the lightness (in CIELAB, that&#x27;s L) dimension. If you have sufficient lightness contrast, then any particular choices of a and b (or hue and chroma) will work fine. If you dont have sufficient lightness contrast, changing the other color components wont help much: even if you maximally separate them in the color space, theyll just appear to mush together in a clashing way along edges.<p>[edit: removed asterisks from L*, etc. because HN thinks they should be for italicizing]",1378053263

6310912,comment,6310555,6310555,4,0,dsego,,,"This is a problem of architecture. Should you mix error handling with application logic? You have to handle errors somewhere, but they pollute the otherwise clean problem-solving code. One solution is to just let the exceptions bubble up and the other is to handle them immediately. If you let them bubble up, you can have a separate module that can do the right thing, notify the user, restart the app or something else. This way, the error handling is somewhat cleanly separated into its own thing. Sometimes you want to handle errors immediately, because only the code where the exception happens, knows how to deal with it. This is where return codes might be better. A lot of it depends on the desired behaviour. Sometimes you want the software to immediately exit or restart if there is a critical exception, sometimes you can safely ignore errors if real-time experience is more important.

The problem is that when you get down to details, there is disagreement about what exactly is an &quot;exceptional condition&quot;.<p>e.g. - you are trying to open a file for reading. The file does not exist. Is this exceptional? That depends on context, but the function that opens the file, being in an independent library, is usually designed without this context.<p>If it does throw an exception, some people complain that &quot;of course it&#x27;e expected that file won&#x27;t be there sometimes! that&#x27;s not exceptional&quot;.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t throw an exception, some people complain that &quot;we tried to open a file, but didn&#x27;t succeed, of course that&#x27;s an exception&quot;. But if you want to avoid an exception in this case, you&#x27;ll need to check for existence before opening (LBYL &quot;look-before-you-leap&quot;), and get into a race condition (TOCTOU &quot;time-of-check,time-of-use&quot;), which is really bad.<p>So it very often happens that you are forced by your ecosystem to use exceptions for normal control flow.

Say I&#x27;m writing a function and I have a dictionary I need to access values from often. Now say that 85% of the time the key I need is in the dictionary, but 15% of the time it is not. I could do this:<p><pre><code>    if key in my_dict:
        execute_operation(my_dict[key])
    else:
        pass
</code></pre>
So that if the key is not in the dictionary I do nothing. But this can be expressed more clearly like this:<p><pre><code>    try:
        execute_operation(my_dict[key])
    except KeyError:
        pass
</code></pre>
This is considered to be clearer because it expresses the fact that the key should be in the dictionary, but in some cases is not. And interestingly, performance reflects this. The first method is more efficient in cases where the key is usually not in the dictionary. The second method, on the other hand, is more efficient when the key is usually present in the dictionary.<p>So, in summary, exceptions are used in Python to represent cases where successfully executing the code within the try block is normal, but exceptional conditions could once in awhile occur. Almost all uses of exceptions occur for conditions where the program should not crash. When the program should crash we just let the exception bubble up to the top level where we gracefully shut down the program and call an exit function.",1378051419

6310874,comment,6309834,6310507,5,0,T-hawk,,,"One answer: Things don&#x27;t inevitably match up on the bottom.  The tetrahedron is the counterexample.  Constructing it based around one vertex as you describe (call it the north pole) does not result in a matching cap around the south pole.  Of course, the gap around the south pole is still congruent to the three original triangles.  It must be by the rules of Platonic solids, because the other three vertices must each behave identically to the original north pole, meaning the south-pole-centered triangle must be identical to the other triangles.<p>Here&#x27;s a more general answer.  The solid always has N-way radial symmetry when viewed from above any vertex, such as our north pole.  All longitude lines at 360/N intervals are identical from this method of construction.  There is nothing to differentiate the triangle of your icosahedron on the 0 meridian from its counterpart at 72, so they will all fall into the same relationship with the south pole.  The polygons can&#x27;t overlap the south pole from one direction while falling short from another.  In the tetrahedron, the south pole gets overlapped equally from all three radial directions.  In the other four solids, the edges and faces meet exactly at the south pole.<p>I can&#x27;t answer exactly why that last sentence is true.  It reduces to, why does this construction method always produce symmetry across the equator for the four non-tetrahedron solids?  Your strip of 10 triangles on the icosahedron: if that is indeed equatorial, then we have both latitudinal and longitudinal symmetry which renders your north and south hemispheres identical so things will match up.  But why does that strip of 10 triangles end up centered on the equator?  I do not have the answer to that, but maybe someone does.",1378051373

This is not an example of people voting to reduce their salaries because they understand the business finances.  That is a ridiculous idea.<p>This is more of a Russian Roulette [1] scenario:  If you don&#x27;t vote for reduction in pay you might lose your job.  Without knowing whether you are safe or not all you know is that there is some probability of losing your job.  Therefore, the best option in front of you is to go for the pay cut and guarantee you are safe.<p>This is not an example of altruistic [2] behavior but rather almost exactly the opposite.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism</a>",1378051278

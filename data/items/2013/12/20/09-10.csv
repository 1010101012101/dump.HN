6940673,comment,6936321,6940421,3,0,sethrin,,,"Yii still exists? Why?<p>Laravel has a half decent API and doesn&#x27;t rely overmuch on (untestable) static functions. My evaluation of FuelPHP was admittedly brief, but let&#x27;s take another look:<p><a href=\"http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/controllers/base.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/controllers/base.html</a><p>and <a href=\"http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/models.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/models.html</a><p>For those who may be unaware, the issue with static functions is that, if you are calling a static method, you will execute that method. You&#x27;re not able to choose not to execute that method (unless you do something surpassingly stupid like checking whether you&#x27;re in test mode), and you can&#x27;t generally make that method return anything other than what it normally does. Isolating that static method is rather difficult, and if that static method happens to call another one, well, it had better not be an issue with your test, because you&#x27;re not going to stop it happening.<p>I know the FuelPHP devs have gone on record saying that Fuel doesn&#x27;t rely heavily on static methods, and that static methods aren&#x27;t a problem, and that to the degree to which there is a problem, they are gonna fix it, but...<p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/K03HMyVs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/K03HMyVs</a><p>Here we compare CakePHP, Laravel, and FuelPHP (Thank you to Sebastian Bergmann for providing the statistics utility). For anyone actually evaluating these platforms, you may want to check out these benchmarks as well:<p><a href=\"http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks</a><p>Without saying anything about how easy or fast it would be to develop for each of them, it seems that for trivial tasks Laravel > Fuel > Cake. From the code statistics, we have:\nFuel: 785 static methods (22.45%) \nCake: 530 static methods (7.96%)\nYii: 483 static methods (7.95%)\nLaravel: 0 (0.00%)<p>Laravel seems pretty light as far as that goes, and generally when I&#x27;m faced with a large project I want the framework to be large as well. I feel like otherwise I&#x27;m going to end up finding or writing libraries for things that I feel like the framework should take care of. I would have a hard time recommending a PHP framework, imo they&#x27;re all pretty much crap. Laravel is not better per se than other frameworks, but it does (far) less, and therefore does it less badly. Divine intervention alone will fix the PHP world at this point, but if you can avoid CodeIgniter, Yii, and FuelPHP, probably no other choices will be as bad.",1387532396

The problem with strlcat and strlcpy is that they assume that it&#x27;s okay to arbitrarily discard data for the sake of preventing a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow may be prevented, but because data may have been discarded, the program is still incorrect.  This is roughly analogous to clamping floating point overflow to DBL_MAX and merrily continuing in the calculation. ;)<p>This is still a bug in your program, and it can still specifically be a security risk; if you want to cap a buffer, you need to fail the operation, not just silently discard some of the data.<p>Further down-thread, here is Ulrich&#x27;s (I will argue 100% correct) rant:<p>> Dammit, it is not safe.  It hides bugs in programs.  If a string is too long for an allocated memory block the copying must not simply silently stop.  Instead the program must reallocate or signal an error.  I can construct you cases where the use of these stupid functions is creating new security problem.<p>I realize it is fun (and sadly part of the zeitgeist at this point) to rag on Ulrich, but a lot of the things he&#x27;s said over the years have been quite insightful, and you should at least read the full conversation before judging him.",1387532139

If a population is motivated enough, a non-violent resistance movement could look very much like a country which anybody could invade, but nobody could control.<p>To apply an example: If this resistance was trained into the British public, and the Germans marched into London and declared themselves conquerers, the population would ignore them. When they are ordered to build factories here, to report to detention centres there, they would simply refuse to. Threats and demonstrations of force aimed at extracting compliance by brutalising certain segments of the population would be disregarded by the rest of the population[1].<p>Supplies for the conquerors would go missing or never be produced. They would have to rely on their own manpower to oversee all operations at gunpoint. As soon as the men with guns are called away somewhere else, work stops, workers disappear.<p>Any population which could respond in this manner would be unconquerable not in terms of territory, but in terms of spirit, which I believe is the sort of thing Ghandi was after.<p>The degree to which you could ever implement this system is dubious.

It&#x27;s that it looks at the stories proposed by Christianity and calls &quot;bullshit&quot; because of Occam&#x27;s razor.<p>Virgin birth. Resurrection. Parting the seas. Water into wine. And so on. Things that straight up, didn&#x27;t fucking happen, ever, by any reasonable probabilistic estimation based on what we know about the world today, and those are far more recent than billions of years ago - words in a book are so far outweighed by what we know about the world that we&#x27;re talking sub .01% chances here. And if you want to start calling them metaphors or helpful fictions, that&#x27;s fine, but you&#x27;re departing from any regular version of Christianity.<p>If the rules of our universe were so flexible that stuff like that could happen with such regularity less than a few thousand years ago, it&#x27;s overwhelmingly likely that we&#x27;d have seen some evidence of gross violations of physical laws today.<p>When it comes to creation and all that, sure, science is blind, most scientists would agree with you there.

If it improved in the meantime and my comments are no longer representative, I&#x27;m really sorry. I should have made that clearer.<p>However, as for the other matters:<p>> we do have escrows by default- called Milestone Payments.<p>Actually, you don&#x27;t have them by default :-). By your own admitting:<p>> We don&#x27;t however force people to use them if the two parties decide to come to an arrangement where they don&#x27;t want to use them.<p>My (admittedly foggy, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) memory tells me that RAC had escrows <i>by default</i>, i.e. the buyer had to place the money in RAC&#x27;s escrow before the coder could start work. I distinctly remember that RAC&#x27;s seller instructions clearly said you <i>should not start coding</i> before the project is awarded to you, because there is no way to be sure the buyer actually has the money to pay you. When the project was awarded, the money was placed in escrow. I actually had a dispute settled over this matter: my client had simply vanished. I waited for two weeks before telling him I&#x27;d get the project into arbitration if I don&#x27;t receive feedback, and waited another three before getting it into arbitration. The RAC arbitrator decided that if he failed to respond within some reasonable period (a couple of weeks, again), I&#x27;d get the money, because the deliverable I had submitted was indeed in accordance with what had been agreed.<p>Freelancer.com doesn&#x27;t force buyers to do that, giving rise to the following phenomenon: a scammer opens an account -- with zero reviews <i>but</i> a verified payment method -- and posts a job ad. It&#x27;s well-paid for something otherwise reasonably simple, like some content writing, but the job has to be done quickly and the buyer claims he can&#x27;t offer a milestone payment that quickly -- he doesn&#x27;t have the money on hand, bank transfer takes time (he usually lists his country to be something like Zambia or Congo, where it&#x27;s probably fairly safe to assume that banks don&#x27;t go too smoothly with all the firing in the street and whatnot). Since the pay is higher than average, a lot of freelancers are happy to do it. Needless to say, they never get their money.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to say, but when this happened, your large support team did absolutely nothing. They simply reminded her that she should ask for a milestone payment, which a lot of buyers actually don&#x27;t want to do for credible, or at the very least legitimate reasons. If you don&#x27;t want to force people into escrowing, you should be able to deal with cases like these.<p>This wasn&#x27;t an isolated incident because the same type of job ad appeared several times in the following weeks. We actually tried to warn other freelancers about it and we found at least another dozen people got the same treatment, quite possibly from the same guy who was opening different accounts, and from the same support team.<p>Edit: Oh yes, rounding of fees.<p>This page: <a href=\"http://www.freelancer.com/feesandcharges/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.freelancer.com/feesandcharges/</a> claims that, for a free membership plan, Freelancer.com gets 10% of what gets paid to a freelancer, or 5 USD, whichever is greater. Fair enough.<p>But if I try to bid for 100 USD that gets paid to me, the bid now gets to 111.11 USD, which looks an awful lot closer to 11%.<p>I initially assumed this had something to do with including the 3% amount that the employer is charged for the posting, too, but it doesn&#x27;t add up. I never really bothered understanding how it goes; as I mentioned in my other post, I haven&#x27;t done freelance work on what is today Freelancer.com since the days it was still called Rent a Coder. But in the best case, this is poorly documented. I, for one, can&#x27;t make sense of it, and I&#x27;m probably better at doing math than most freelancers who do content &quot;writing&quot; or social media promotion on your website.<p>Even later edit: just to be clear, I&#x27;m not trying to scold your business model, nor your efforts as a company. If your current model works for you, then it&#x27;s awesome. Matters of finance and corporate politics are beyond either my possibilities and my wish to comprehend. Freelancer.com isn&#x27;t doing bad financially (though, since I&#x27;m not living off its dividends, that&#x27;s irrelevant to me) so I presume there are people for whom it makes world a better place. For me, it doesn&#x27;t.",1387530477

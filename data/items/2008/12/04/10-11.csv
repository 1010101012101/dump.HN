385541,comment,385323,385345,0,0,Angostura,,,"Actually, most of the complaints I've seen about the Touch and the iPhone seem to be about the <i>lack</i> of storage. I have a 16Gig Touch and it is crammed.<p>Let's see...<p>8Gigs of audio (including a lot of BBC podcasts)\n4 Gigs of video\n2 Gigs of photos\n200Mb apps\n200 megs app data.<p>I've never bought video through iTunes, but video is extremely useful. When we go away on holiday, I always encode a couple of children's series on to it which comes in very handy as an occassional treat for the two girls when its getting late and we are setting up a tent, or we have a boring hour or two in a aiport terminal or on a very long flight (We're in the UK, my wife's family in Australia). Video also gets used to transport home movies to my parents' house for viewing through the TV.<p>Is video a 'killer app'? No, but it was definitely a nice-to-have factor in the purchasing decision, as was the excellent Web browsing and e-mail client.",1228387826

385538,comment,384897,385051,0,0,mojuba,,,"If it was only that.<p>How about ""Unicode, only Unicode, nothing but Unicode""? Doesn't it smell Microsoftish/Sunish? 16-bit data is a pain in the arse, and as long as communication hardware is essentially 8-bit, Unicode will never replace old good 8-bit and UTF. It will only make your I/O programming harder and the programs themselves slower, with no real benefit. UTF-8 gives you a perfect solution for all your localization needs without any special support on the compiler side.<p>I have mixed feelings about Python ""3000"". Many changes are meant to bring more consistency (if saying <i>you shouldn't do this because it's bad</i> is called ""consistency""), however, as a result Python 3 will successfully make it into the corporate environments, but will never be truly popular among geeks. Stick with 2.6, it's nice.",1228387390

Because it really is astonishingly, mind-bendingly awesome.<p>Granted, the leading Perl 6 implementation is still a little over a year away (though Parrot hits 1.0 in March, which is a pretty cool milestone in and of itself), and I imagine Ruby 1.9 will be widely available long before then.",1228387253

385530,comment,384606,385300,0,0,bokonist,,,"I find your essay a bit confusing because you never define what ""success"" or ""better"" means.  There are many different ways of measuring organizational success.<p>When you say that traditionally, bigger organizations were better, do you mean they were better:<p>a) militarily \nb) in developing new technologies that make lives better\nc) in producing goods like trains and cars\nd) better at generating revenues/profits\ne) better at attracting the best and the brightest\nf) producing achievements that are remembered by historians\ng) all of the above<p>It is important to clarify this, because some of these measures of success oppose each other.  For instance, the Egyptian governments were great at f) but at the expense of b).<p>I at first took your essay to define success as b) improving technology. But if so, the thesis is obviously wrong.  Most of the great inventions of the industrial revolution were created by tinkerers and small enterprises, not large organizations.  Just look at the development of the textile technology <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_clothing_and_textiles_technology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_clothing_and_textil...</a> . Almost every single invention from 1600 to 1900 was developed by a startup (and many of these startups were funded by outside investors, Kleiners Perkins has nothing on the Boston Associates <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Associates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Associates</a> ).",1228386751

385525,comment,385068,385155,0,0,13ren,,,"I've really got to learn to stop posting anything to HackerNews that in any way can be construed as an admission of weakness or vulnerability. I sensed that was the case here when I was writing, but didn't think it was necessary to hide it. I will be more careful in future to not reveal more than is absolutely necessary, and so avoid this typical, casually condescending reply. It's annoying because it's the ""mistake"" that gets seized on, instead of what I'm saying... as if there's more interest in correction than communication.<p>Maybe I am alone here in disliking unsolicited advice, but ironically, when I ask a question here, I usually don't get any help...<p>...so perhaps the secret is not to <i>ask</i>, but state something that <i>incidentally</i> reveals the lack of knowledge, so the scent of inexcusable ignorance rouses the instinctive hacker display of superior knowledge. I will try this.<p>Or maybe, I am just not a <i>hacker</i>. Although I love coding (especially to help other people) and I'm not a corporate type, I am coming to think this more and more; because behaviour like giving unsolicited advice seems to be totally acceptable and approved of on sites like this, but by my values is a form of trolling, and has never sat well with me.<p><i>EDIT</i> I just checked the site mqt lists in his profile (<a href=""http://mark.nirv.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mark.nirv.net/</a>), and judging by his May 26, 2007 entries, he does troll at times (""What a f______ p___""; ""Use a spell checker next time, a______."" - to me, that's really abusive). Trolls have sometimes gotten under my radar by combining genuine knowledge and apparent helpfulness with their trolling. Oh well, you live and you learn; without risking mistakes and uncongeniality, one cannot learn.",1228386500

The problem wasn&#x27;t posting the drone video to YouTube.  The problem was turning on monetization for the drone videos.  If you try to make money a drone flight, you are using the drone commercially.  The fact that the money actually made is less than a dollar doesn&#x27;t really matter as the intention is there to make money.  Not saying I agree with the rule, but it seems to be pretty straightforward with relatively little room for interpretation.<p>EDIT: Even the updated HN headline still doesn&#x27;t have it right.  Neither the video nor the drone flight are illegal.  The video just bumps the flight up to a higher tier of regulation from a hobby flight to a commercial flight.  A better headline might be &quot;FAA says monetized videos retroactively qualify drone flights as commercial flights.&quot;",1426186561

Funny enough out of &quot;functional&quot; languages those have probably just as much (or even more) been used to develop distributed, fault tolerant systems than F# or Haskell. Just saying.<p>BTW both Clojure and Erlang allow a form a gradual typing.<p>From personal experience. I&#x27;ve used both static (C#, C++, Java) and dynamic typing (Python, Erlang), and have to say, the prevents-many-bugs excuse as the main problem with dynamic types just wasn&#x27;t true.<p>Maybe my code is more complicated and dealing with distributed state, consistency, and protocols but what what kills everything is usually logic errors, network failures, files not being there, misconfiguration, segfaults, user-after-free, and the most evil ones, shared global states in a concurrent shared-heap environment.<p>Things like &quot;oh I expected an int but got a string&quot; are pretty trivial and easy discovered.<p>Moreover, in a recent service I implemented. I did in Python and I believe the faster development time and less code to write in general, gave me time to write better integration tests that exercises and covered the code a lot better. I would have had to write the tests anyway, even if this was written in Haskell.<p>Perhaps static typing helps a lot more in large code bases. Think of a large game, or a CAD application or some huge C++ back-end.  But, if you buying into the whole micro-services fad, well, you shouldn&#x27;t have large code bases if you can help it.<p>Another big motivation for types, which I think most people have in mind when they pick a strongly typed language is performance. Usually static typing and a very large performance increase would go hand in hand. Now with the effort put into v8 and PyPy we see that gap getting smaller.",1426186428

9192918,comment,9190551,9191910,0,0,perdunov,,,"You&#x27;re right that writing singletons needs expertise because there are a number of (possibly unsolvable) gotchas that you need to know about to even start using singletons.<p>Take the self-referencing problem: let&#x27;s say we have a logger singleton (pretty simple, what could possibly go wrong?) And let&#x27;s say that the logger singleton invokes particular code during its initialization, such as the file I/O code that is also our own and that uses... guess what? a logger! Thus, when the logger class initializes, it will either try to log using an uninitialized object or invoke the initialization recursively depending on whether the singleton is lazy or not. A beginner is normally not aware of this problem when they are writing their singleton class. Another problem is the initialization order: what is initialized first - the logger singleton or the I/O singleton? Turns out, we just <i>have to</i> use lazy initialization. Then the multithreading comes on the scene. So you have to make a thread safe lazy singleton. But that implies additional cost on every call for the singleton.<p>I don&#x27;t know... Singletons are a mess.",1426186224

I know how tough of a position to be in this is -- you sound a lot like I was in school.<p>First, dropping out is a serious thing, and I wouldn&#x27;t take any random internet advice at face value on it.  Do you have family/friends/etc you could talk to?  School guidance department?  Does your college let you take a year off?  I&#x27;m happy to chat more about it if you want, but you will get better advice from others on this.  It also sounds like you may be taking the wrong classes -- maybe explore and see if others are more interesting?<p>As for programming, it&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s a passion for you.  It may not seem like it right now, but there are lots of low-risk ways to see if that passion is real, and get more into the scene.  Going to hackathons is a great first step.  You get to meet other coders, potentially interact with some companies, and build something.<p>It sounds like you might have a portfolio already of projects.  Why not talk to some local companies that are looking for interns?  Does anyone visit your campus?  If you already have some projects, those will be a lot more relevant than your GPA.  An internship would give you all summer to explore your interest, and see where it takes you.  Some colleges have intern match programs.<p>If you have a good portfolio, you could also try to take on some consulting work.  Depending on what languages you know, this can be pretty easy, and would give you a nice way to gain some skills.  Go to local tech meetups.  Join your campus programming club.  There&#x27;s always people there who can connect you to companies.<p>As you start to meet more people and network, I think you&#x27;ll naturally start to answer some of the questions you&#x27;re having.<p>I&#x27;m happy to chat more.

Even if that means switching majors to one of those &quot;bullshit social sciences&quot;. The piece of paper still matters, true most of all in the corporate world, but not just there. You are far better off having a line on your resume that lists a college and omits a GPA than having no education on your resume at all. If you&#x27;re almost at the finish line there&#x27;s no point in walking away now.<p>On the other hand, if this is near the beginning of your college career, maybe it is a good idea to take some time off. It doesn&#x27;t cost you anything to get a leave of absence versus just quitting. It doesn&#x27;t obligate you to go back, but it leaves the door open. Use the time to find out if you are bullshitting yourself about willing to do some real learning so long as its on your terms. Find out what the job market is like. Figure out what it means to be responsible for your own schedule, with your ability to live (or at least live decently) on the line instead of just a bad grade. You&#x27;ll either go back to school more motivated or you&#x27;ll find that you are thriving without a college degree. In the latter case, if you ultimately do find you need the paper, there are increasing opportunities to do so for working adults (though life can make that really tough if e.g. you have kids).<p>For what it is worth, I took a semester off after doing really poorly and worked as a programmer during the first dotcom bubble, then returned to finish my degree.

- I had a clear role model (mentor)
- I had several good sounding boards for ideas (professors had more time for me than for undergrads, and graduate students were also closer friends)
- More frequent communication with professors translated to better grades (if they&#x27;re aware of your thought processes, they can more clearly understand how to interpret your work).<p>As a result, I felt much more involved in the work I was doing. That feeling of involvement made me more invested (and more confident) in my work.<p>I know that some colleges are working on programs to supplement mentorship and structure, and are finding great success. For example, in the ASAP program (<a href=""http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.cuny.edu/sites/asap/</a>), the graduation rate is more than three times the national three-year graduation rate of 16% for urban community colleges.

He obviously had severe mental health problems, and killing himself was disproportionate to what he was facing.<p>2. I&#x27;ve had two friends do time for Federal, non-violent crimes, and it wasn&#x27;t horrible for either of them. It mostly just kind of sucked. Not even close to a worst-case scenario. Family embarrassment and having a felony on their record was the worst of it for each of them. Aaron could have turned all that to his favor.<p>3. It&#x27;s an unpopular thing to say around here, but before becoming an activist for a cause, it&#x27;d be worth talking to a lawyer. No doubt the prosecutor was overzealous (what else is new?) but Swartz&#x27;s operation was both ham-fisted and a bit unhinged. He obviously was trying to get away with something, he just got caught. He really should have thought that through before doing it, during, and after.<p>4. And if you&#x27;re actually guilty of something–however absurd that law is, it&#x27;s law–fight like mad (which includes appeals) and then take the best plea bargain your attorney can get you, and make the most of it. A six-month term would have been the best thing that could have happened to his cause–afterwards he would have had immense credibility as an activist with both character and credibility.<p>This should all enter into your cost/benefit thinking.

I don&#x27;t go to class anymore.<p>I can recognize that it&#x27;s entirely my maturity and work ethic that is the problem here. When I do find myself going to class, I comprehend fully. I don&#x27;t find it hard to catch up, even. When I leave class, I don&#x27;t do homework and I don&#x27;t study.<p>This is the first time I&#x27;m admitting it to myself, but I don&#x27;t believe I can succeed in this system. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m lying to myself when I say I love learning, or if I&#x27;m just much more subpar than I&#x27;m willing to recognize.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m an unmotivated individual, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve always been a self-learner. I hate this whole system of, go to a class for 50 minutes and study a subject, spend an hour later in the day doing some homework in the same subject, and maybe do this every other day. When I learn, I&#x27;m much better at spending 10 hours really consuming the material, flying through chapters, and then doing that for 5-6 days in a row. Formal education doesn&#x27;t cater to me in this regard.<p>I love to program. The few hours in the day that I&#x27;m happy are when I&#x27;m reading mailing lists and and working on personal projects. I truly believe that if I was to drop out, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time doing anything else. I&#x27;d be able to really embrace the style of learning that works best for me.<p>I think that a few years from now I would find myself more prepared for the real world than most of my friends, although, I think they would similarly find that they have an easier time finding work than I. But that doesn&#x27;t worry me a ton.<p>I&#x27;ve watched my father be an EE for his whole life, programming and managing for a boring company that makes controllers. I don&#x27;t want to enter that ecosystem _at all_. I have watched him hate his life in exchange for a paycheck, and I&#x27;d like to opt out from that system entirely. What best fits that? The market for full stack engineers / web developers / app developers. And alternatively, the start up scene.<p>I wonder if the reason I&#x27;m involved with coding at all is because it caters so much to my preferred style of learning. Maybe that&#x27;s why I latched onto it so hard in late middle school.<p>Anyway, thanks for reading. Let me know what you guys think I should do, or if there are any questions you think I should pose to myself to really figure this out.",1426184904

Each of our repos has a .config file in it which defines what it depends on, and we have a simple script which &#x27;installs&#x27; packages by git clone and then creates symlinks into the proper places. Because we&#x27;re not using submodules, we don&#x27;t have any of the standard submodule issues (e.g. if you do a &#x27;git pull&#x27; you have to commit that to the main repository and push or it shows as a change).<p>The tool also handles scanning through our &#x27;install&#x27; directory, determining what packages are installed, doing a &#x27;git pull&#x27;, post-install/post-update hooks, multi-branch support, show local changes/uncommitted changes, etc.<p>The other option for you (since our dependency list is fairly flat and uncomplicated, and yours may not be) would be to create a yaml/xml/json file to specify the directory structure and which packages go where, and then have the tool automatically update them appropriately. Alternately, store a .config.yml file in each repo telling what other repos should be cloned where, and let your tool recurse through it.<p>The nice thing about a tool like that is you can add functionality like e.g. doing a batch-commit (commit all changes in all/specified repositories, with the same commit message, create the same tag name for all of them in all repos, etc), batch-rollback, and so on.<p>Just a thought.",1426184642

GitLab fills this niche nicely, in that the community edition is based on fully open-source code, while the enterprise edition (that the their commercial service gitlab.com is based on) uses proprietary extensions.<p>&quot;The projects with the most stars on gitlab s gitlab itself with 221 stars right now.

3339134,comment,3338155,3338155,5,0,mindcrime,,,"Meh, all of these debates about ""the mythical 10x programmer"" are missing an important point:  You can't just lump all programmers into one batch in the first place. That is, I posit that there are programmers who are better at certain things, or better in certain domains, or better at certain times of day, or even better during certain phases of the moon.  Whatever.<p>Maybe one guy is a goddamn genius when it comes to writing embedded systems code in C, but if you put him to work writing CRUD webapps in Ruby, he might just be average.  Or vice versa.  Or maybe one gal is shit-hot at writing statistical analysis code for dealing with scientific data, but is useless if recast into a role doing embedded systems in C.  Who knows?<p>To use an analogy, imagine this... you have a group of football players.  You take the one who's best suited for playing Left Tackle and ask him to play Tailback.  And maybe you move the Quarterback to Fullback.   In either case, they are going to fail miserably, even if they would otherwise be an All-Pro at their ""natural"" position, simply because the attributes required to be great can't be generalized to a generic ""Football Player"" requirement.<p>In other words ""Fit Matters.""  I posit that it matters a LOT more than most people acknowledge, or certainly more than you hear anybody discussing.   And let's not even get into the importance of chemistry and the ""gel"" factor among the members of a team.  It isn't popular to talk about these factors; probably because they're hard to measure / validate empirically and so this all remains a mostly subjective thing.  But I believe this discussion is just as important as - if not more important than - all the debate about ""10x programmers.""",1323571242

3339095,comment,3338839,3338839,4,0,moocow01,,,"I couldn't agree with this article more.  Due to the awkwardness around not accepting a friend invite, my Facebook consists of just about everyone I've ever known in my life.  It is convenient to have an easy channel to track someone down if you need to talk to them but the wall has become completely unusable to me.  The combination of 1) having too many people that I don't have real relationships with on Facebook 2) many of my <i>friends</i>' postings of very low value things (ex. I'm eating an apple right now) 3) the increased usage of auto-updates (ex. I'm listening to 'Rihanna'), Facebook has turned into a wasteland of posts where about 1 / 500 updates are actually useful to me and finding that 1 is no longer worth it.  I know the natural response to this is that I should be organizing my friends better but I'm not sure that this is a solution, because I have certain friends that will post 'low value' updates and then post something very 'high value' (value meaning somehow interesting to me).  So the first problem for Facebook is trying to figure out how to cherry pick the good posts to show me and this in itself is incredibly difficult.  But the problem gets exponentially harder as I add more friends (which will continue to happen to avoid awkward moments in the real world) assuming that I only have time to read X number of updates.  In other words if on average every friend has 1 / 100 high value updates, the chance of Facebook getting it right and getting that high value update into the 100 updates I read every day gets lower as I add more friends and there is more noise to filter.  It seems to me that there may be a bell curve to the usefulness of Facebook based on your friend count - in the beginning it is marginally useful when you only have a few friends, it becomes very useful when you have some magical conservative number of friends and then it becomes again marginally useful as your friend count gets very high.  The problem is that keeping your friend count at that magical number and not progressing past that is very difficult.",1323569420

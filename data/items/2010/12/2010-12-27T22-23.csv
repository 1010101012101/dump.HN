Disregarding for now any 'grand plan' for further monetization beyond simple replication of this model that the company has, a YC-style (~10k for 6%) investment in a company that has already does $1.8M in sales isn't exactly bad.",1293490717

If 24-hour charging cycles are required for the <i>average case</i> what that means is that you're limiting use for a lot of normal cases. Use the phone a bit more than average or have a long period of poor reception, and then you've exhausted the battery. Which is precisely the case today, it's trivially easy for anyone to exhaust the battery on a modern smartphone in much less than a day.<p>In contrast, a phone that requires charging every week, for example, you'll tend to keep at a higher total charge and will survive periods of heavier usage better.<p>That's not dismissing the fact that most people are willing to accept the tradeoffs of modern smartphone battery life, but make no mistake the necessity of daily recharging for average use is a problem.",1293490416

The amount of influence differs by situation.

People use simple models in math, physics, medicine, sociology, statistics, economics, finance, chemistry, ecology, climatology, astronomy, etc. In almost every field of inquiry, people attempt to build simple models to try to get at the underlying truth of some situation. Real events are full of complex interactions, which often involve more variables than can be easily understood. The human brain is not set up to understand real events in which 200 variables all have some influence.<p>Issac Newton was offering a simple model when he said all matter attracts matter, proportional to its mass and inversely proportional the square of the distance - his model does not explain everything in the Solar system, it especially failed to describe the orbit of Mercury, but it did offer wonderful insight all the same.<p>Lister and Pasteur were both offering a simplified model when they advanced the germ theory of illness, and yet their model offers wonderful insights into disease.<p>Gauss offered simple models for more things than I could possibly list here - some have argued that he was the most important mathematician of all time. He contributed something to group theory, geometry, analysis and he largely invented statistics. And what is statistics, but a set of methods for quantifying simple models or sorting relevant data from the irrelevant?<p>With only slight exaggeration, I could make the argument that the progress of science is the progress of simplifying models.<p>That is the argument for not using ""real people and real numbers"".",1293488384

It is extremely difficult for a firm to fire anyone.<p>I would prefer it if people in this thread could avoid lazy labels like ""capitalist"" or ""socialist"" and instead speak specifically about what policies you think help or hinder German competitiveness.<p>I have trouble imagining that anyone would look at Germany and see it as a model of what an economy can do when the government does nothing - rather, in Germany, the government is everywhere. The state plays a leading role in all aspects of civil society. This does not mean that private sector players have no influence, however, the role of the state is large.<p>I'm uncertain what the original author may have meant by this:<p>""Germany is a socialist as a nation comes and they're one of the most prosperous countries in the world""<p>However, if you recall the debates that happened in Britain and the USA during the 1970s, Germany raises many interesting questions. Both Thatcher and Reagan came to power in a political environment where the labor unions were blamed for the competitive decline of Britain and the USA, respectively. Given the very strong unions in Germany, and Germany's competitiveness, some revision of the 1970s debate in the English speaking countries seems warranted. Apparently it is possible to have very strong labor unions and yet remain competitive.",1293487630

I'm personally a proponent of tossing the current Prelude and replacing it with something more useful. I think the supposed costs are smaller than expected (it's already modular) and the benefits underestimated. I'm not a Haskell booster, I'm an interested skeptic.<p>I just think an article about a relatively esotoric issue about Haskell got upvoted suspiciously quickly on a holiday weekend.

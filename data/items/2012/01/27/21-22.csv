3520352,comment,3520108,3520204,3,0,cluda01,,,"Writing use cases and thinking about how the user is going to interact with your system is a very large part of creating correct and defect free software. Besides the obvious ""will the user get it"" it has a huge benefit when it comes time to design of your test suite.<p>Consider an imperative programming language where you can have null values. A null value most often means that some piece of data is optional or not required for operation. One example of this could be a form field for users to enter their real names. If you're making a social site ala reddit or something else you might want to make real names optional. Hence when someone fetches the real name field or passes it as an argument to another method it could be null.<p>Designing the use cases will help you because when it comes time to write the implementation and test cases you have a concrete understanding of why the value is null. If your program is sufficiently complex this real name field may end up being passed around to several seemingly unrelated modules. Having the use cases drawn up prior to implementation will help you quickly diagnose those crashes or null pointer exceptions and more generally answering the question ""Why is this value null?""<p>Edit: Ineligibility ++",1327701401

This is demonstrably true, at least in the U.S.<p>I would say that it is demonstrably not true in many EU countries. Maybe ""non personalisation"" is the tendency of lazy teachers, but I remember pretty well how my math teachers repeated the same subject thrice: the first time describing its core in an abstract way, the second time with concrete examples (apples and pears) and the third time in very little incremental steps. The first explanation was for naturally able math learner, the second for those how needed practical examples and the third for less able pupils. Some of us complained about the fact that it was a boring way to teach (and you know how horrible bored kids can be in the class) but I'd say it was worth it to have all my classmates learning more or less at the same pace with nobody left behind.<p>Actually, I complain more about the fact that we had to change math teachers so many times because of educational reforms and budget cuts/reorganizations.",1327701147

American consumers get the products they want, China gets the opportunity to improve the quality of life for its citizens, and Apple continues to do what it wants. It's a win win win situation.<p>You're arguing for companies to use US manufacturing and that's a naive view in the long run.

I can certainly see the point that all of this separation is unnecessary on a typical modern desktop system, but several of the paths you listed in support of your argument are not actually specified by the FHS, nor do they even make sense.<p>Of the paths you mentioned, there is no such thing as:<p><pre><code>    /usr/share/bin\n    /usr/share/local/bin\n    /usr/local/share/bin\n    /usr/local/share/lib\n    /usr/share/lib\n    /opt/bin\n</code></pre>\nAll the paths that involve `share` are for non-executable data, so `bin` and `lib` subdirectories of these don't make sense. That's not to categorically say that there isn't any OS that provides them anyway--I've seen plenty of Linux distros with disorganized file systems--but that's a problem with the distro, not the FHS as a whole.<p>The `/opt` hierarchy is pretty much the wild west, I'll give you that. It's basically like `Program Files` on Windows; packages get an entire hierarchy to themselves. Most of the software I've seen that installs to `/opt` is Linux ports of Windows software, where the authors were either ignorant of the Unix way of organizing things, or simply didn't want to bother conforming with the norms of a different platform.<p>Incidentally, one of the reasons I prefer Arch Linux over some other distros is that the organization of the file system follows the standard and actually makes sense. Things are always where I expect them to be.<p>Your overall point may have some merit, but it feels a little like you're reaching for support for your position by making up wacky, confusing paths that don't actually exist.",1327700465

3520286,comment,3518967,3519411,6,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Good points.  To add a few from my own experience:<p><i>>I've come around to thinking that Zed Shaw (as just one example) is right about this. With his ""Learn X the Hard Way"" books he starts out by basically saying ""just type this in"" (and don't copy and paste). Don't worry what it does. You'll figure that out later.</i><p>That's basically the 10,000hr approach - the earlier you start programming, even at Zed's most basic level, the earler you start rewiring your neurons to do it more efficiently and effectively.  For the natural born programmers in the article's study, this isn't necessary, but for that whole other group aren't natural born, I do believe something like this is very necessary if any of them hope to become effective programmers.  It's not impossible for them, as the study implies, but does require taking into account how the mind works (which we know now thanks to modern neuroscience), how it is malleable, and then designing an instructional course around that understanding.<p>Additionally, trying to educate the 'goats', the second group, at the same pace as the 'sheep' is going to fail.  It simply takes more effort and more time for their minds to adjust, for things to 'click', for their neural pathways to rewire.  Especially when that the thing that is getting rewired is their fundamental need to grok meaning amongst the relatively 'meaningless' rules that programming consists of.  They're not a lost cause, but trying to educate them with the same curriculum and pace is.<p>Finally, the programming instruction should, as you imply, be bottom-up exploratory, not top-down memorize-apply-repeat.  Part of the problem may also be that people with weaker working memories have a harder time with the academic approach to learning, even project-based ones.  One of my favorite pieces of anecdotal evidence for this is from a story Paul Graham linked from 'Beating the Averages' [0].<p>So, given that it takes significantly more time and effort for the second group, it is all the more imperative that they start earlier, as early in life as possible.  As soon as they can read and type, basically.<p>And in order to increase the amount of time per day that such students can spend practicing programming, it may also be worth delaying math education, or integrating it with programming education.  Something's gotta give.  No more pen and paper math, or even calculator math, if possible, rather learn how construct and solve math problems in code.<p>That may sound extreme, but given where the world is going [1], I think nothing should be off the table when it comes to teaching people, even (especially) the 'goats', to code.  Even if they go on to non-programmer jobs, the ability to think both abstractly and concretely simultaneously, and the ability to handle meaninglessness, are both supremely valuable, no matter what you endeavor.<p>0.  <a href=""http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html</a><p>1.  <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405311190348090457651...</a>",1327700352

I personally believe Cython is not an answer here and you <i>actually</i> need full python to do most, especially for unexperienced users, so we're primarily targeting the niche that can't be possibly attacked by any solution that's based on CPython.<p>As for other stuff - numpy even if you vectorize stuff is nowhere near the speed of C.

It has all of the really beautiful system stuff of FreeBSD (rc.conf, predictable file hierarchy, documentation) and matches them or does better. It forces you to learn how things work and does a good job of teaching you good practices. Even if you don't use Arch, the Arch wiki is a gold mine on configuring pretty much anything.<p>The main thing Arch has over FreeBSD is you get easy access to lots of shiny toys. Pacman repos update much more frequently and the process of updating packages is <i>much</i> faster. If your favorite text editor drops a new version, it will be available in Arch repos in minutes/hours; it may be months before it makes it to FreeBSD ports. And things like audio, video drivers, wireless are pretty painless in Arch compared to FreeBSD.<p>The biggest downside of Arch is that it sits on the complete opposite side of the security spectrum. FreeBSD makes sure you start with a secure machine and anything you do to cheapen the security is your bag; most of the time it'll try to let you know you when you're doing it wrong. The BSDs in general have a really healthy culture of security paranoia. You don't get that with Arch. Signed packages have only recently made their way into pacman and I'm not sure if they're even required yet. So a lot of the time, it feels like you just have to cross your fingers and trust that the repos you're hitting haven't been compromised. And you're constantly installing software from them.<p>Also, occasionally you'll need to spend 5 or 10 minutes recovering from a wonky upgrade (upgrading often is better than not).<p>Arch is an excellent, if not secure, desktop/laptop environment and you'd be crazy to run a production server on it.",1327700076

What exactly did he do different than his predecessors? What were his great accomplishments exactly, that put him in the same category as Newton and Gauss, or even higher than them?<p>> So what's the big stink with Newton? I mean, we have much better mathematicians and scientists now? By modern standards Newton is incomplete and imprecise. <-- Note sarcasm.<p>Even though you mark this as sarcasm, I'd like to address this. Of course modern mathematicians and scientists do better in absolute terms. What Newton did is now common knowledge. What makes Newton so great is not his absolute level, but the things he <i>added</i> to science. The delta between scientific and mathematical knowledge before Newton and after Newton is huge. So what is da Vinci's delta? In concrete terms; not just a logical fallacy like ""you don't know what da Vinci's contributions are, so they are so entrenched in society that they <i>must</i> be great!"".<p>> (Note: Don't confuse what I'm talking about with linear perspective, developed in the west by Brunelleschi, a contemporary of Da Vinci. Linear perspective is vitally important to this, and Da Vinci made good use of it. Visually, better than anyone else at the time.)<p>Interestingly, perspective was already understood by Euclid in 300BC and described in his work on optics. Alas, like the Greeks' knowledge that the earth is a sphere (heck they even measured the diameter), this was largely forgotten and didn't become mainstream artistic knowledge until much later.<p>> Da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine</a>) was one project.

And it's considered a lessor work.<p>I'm sorry if this comes of as rude, but that's hardly proof that da Vinci was an extraordinarily good painter. Still, I have no problem conceding this point the third time. When I look at da Vinci's paintings I see nothing particularly worthy of deification above all other painters (on the contrary), but then I don't have a degree in Fine Arts so I accept that people who are experts on the matter have it right and my tastes have it wrong.<p>The problem is that he is in general deified for being an all-round genius, not just a painter.",1327699040

3520181,comment,3519952,3519952,92,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Wow. As someone who was there (I know dating my self here) reading this is kind of like that scene in Sleeper where the person from the future is trying to understand artifacts from the past.<p>So during the BSD / System V merge (project Lulu at Sun) the /opt filesystem was introduced as a way to keep 'packages' separate from 'system'. The difference between /bin and /sbin was that sbin was 'static-bin' which is to say everything in it was statically linked and could run without any libraries being available.<p>The fact that Linux starts up differently is because Linux never was UNIX they are two different OSes, pretty much from the ground up. They use similar concepts, processes, file descriptors, Etc, but they are two different species. FreeBSD on the other hand <i>is</i> a derivative of UNIX and last time I checked it started up in a similar way.<p>The lack of space on the RK05s was indeed the reason for the addition of /usr/{lib, bin} and the general consensus at Sun and AT&T in the 80's was that the root file system contained the system, and the /usr file system contained stuff that was not-system.<p>AT&T (the guys that 'owned' UNIX) had some pretty detailed specifications about what lived in what directory and why. It was a ""BigDeal"" (tm) to add a new directory in the root file system so new directories, when they were proposed, appeared under /usr. And once /opt existed it gave people free reign to create their own trees. Early package managers would build /opt/<package>/{bin/lib/share/man} and the downside was that ones path variable got longer and longer, and there arguments about if there should be more constraints on opt.",1327698652

Except he named the variables BARF and BEER. And led everyone to believe that if BARF = 3 and BEER = 47 and then BARF = BEER, that their storage contents would be reversed. Nodding his head and asking if this was correct -- to which the entire class raised its hand except for the very few (this was 1983 mind you) who had some experience who sat smugly by, knowing the punchline already.<p>I instinctively also raised my hand, but had an inkling that something was askew, and in a snap, I got it, before he ""played CPU"" and scribbled an line-by-line execute process on the chalkboard. It might sound trite, but it was a thrilling note, to realize something logical that your brain short-circuits. Today, in languages, you can write something like ""a, b = b, a"", giving you that sugar sparing temporary variable and confirmed my choice to pursue a computer science degree.<p>That ""aha"" moment was repeated when learning about pointers, recursion, regular expressions, etc.<p>But I wonder, the way my 1st teacher presented it, if the way he stoked and kindled the curiosity fueled and whetted an aptitude for programming. Not that it made me super-rock-star-programmer but it certainly led me on a quest that resulted in semi-successful (I mean I have made a living, but not built things that sold for millions and billions :)) career.

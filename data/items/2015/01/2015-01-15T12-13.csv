The top 10% of earners right now pay something around 70% of all income tax: <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-inco...</a>. Is that &#x27;fair&#x27;? What is the &#x27;correct&#x27; number? Food for thought.<p>At any rate, the reason the Fair Tax&#x27;s &#x27;regression&#x27; isn&#x27;t bad, is the estimated increase in tax burden for the middle class is around 2-3%. HOWEVER, the estimated wage benefits of the Fair Tax total 5-10%. So, even though the middle class is paying a higher share than now, its net income would go up 2-8%. That&#x27;s a win, plus the entire IRS and income tax apparatus is gone - another huge win.<p>Given the political abuses the IRS has facilitated lately, it needs to go.

Because translations are always crappy - even for big players. Lack of context is the key here - translated text often feels out of place, because there usually is some overarching idea behind them that isn&#x27;t communicated to translators. Then there is lack of consistency. Words in original text often have some site-specific meaning, which tends to also be somehow lost in the translation process. For example, on Facebook the word &quot;like&quot; talks about a well-defined thing, not about the dictionary meaning, so it&#x27;s <i>totally not ok</i> to randomly replace it with synonyms during translation [0].<p>I realized at some point that I often look at a crapy translation, guess what was the English original, and then in my mind translate to what it should be in the first place. Because for some strange reason I, the user, have the context, and the paid translation team has not. I guess I&#x27;m going to put that into my &quot;Translation issues&quot; file in the &quot;Mysteries of capitalism&quot; drawer, right next to &quot;how on Earth multi-milion media companies can&#x27;t do a movie translation that isn&#x27;t a total crap&quot; file. I mean, seriously, you&#x27;re better off looking for pirated subtitles even if you bought the original because pirates at least seem to have watched the movie they&#x27;re translating.<p></rant><p>[0] - I wish more translators would use the approach Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses used when doing their own Bible translation. Since it was designed to be studied and analyzed, they preferred accuracy over aesthetics - therefore one of the translation rules was &quot;as much as possible, let&#x27;s have any given word in original text be always represented by the same word in English&quot;. Adhering to that single rule would eliminate like half of the &quot;context missing&quot; problems with software translations.",1421326533

We are influenceable. Ads invade our environment constantly for that reason, their goal is to influence us into buying something. They can take us to directions that we want to avoid.

It would have been even worse.<p>Those who stay are the ones with the real courage, people say. No, I&#x27;m really sorry, but those who stay are those who have their shoulders covered (by family, maybe) and may have some long-standing interests that give them enough stability to try what they want.<p>But, they won&#x27;t change anything. The system is rigged, you cannot take the power away from those who hold it and who are in charge of the big, important decisions. That is, unless you are ok to play their conservative and self-preserving game, actually becoming part of the skewed systems. Look at what the Movimento 5 Stelle has already become.<p>Recently we even tried with oligarchy - officially called the government of the professors, it was a government made of the Italian &quot;best minds&quot; and it was appointed directly by the President of the Republic. It may have saved us, but it didn&#x27;t really kickstarted the economy back. We&#x27;re now in a triple-dip recession, ask any economist and he would gladly lecture you about our very interesting case.<p>We&#x27;re a country where a lot of people saved and still manage to save, and that has naturally turned us into a very conservative country, where every little change is seen as a menace for the status quo.<p>Long story short, if you want to do something with your life and you have no settled financial interested (or you can manage them from abroad) you flee and put your studies and experience to good use. Otherwise you stay and either get involved in the mess or try to stay out of it and see yourself beaten to the punch by incompetents and people that are just ok with marching aligned with the old and distorted system.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not one of those self-deprecating Italian whiners. I don&#x27;t hate my country. I just think the problem lies with the biggest part of our fellow Italians.

8892218,comment,8891009,8891242,0,0,Mvandenbergh,,,">One thing this article leaves out is a deeper analysis of why the conventional wisdom is to replace a founder with a professional when there are so many famous counterexamples. It could be that at a certain stage in a company&#x27;s growth investors prefer to be more risk-averse and will give up a potential grand slam in order to get a two-run double, or something. (And by extension the OP is willing to take larger risks than the average VC.) Or that there are hidden social dynamics at play.<p>I think one of the reasons that this conventional wisdom is becoming less common is that &#x27;technology startup&#x27; is more likely to mean a company with a product and customers now than in the past when it frequently meant a company that had brought a new technology to the commercialisation stage.<p>In companies of the latter type, it can make sense to move the founding CEO to a CTO role because that has been their actual role in the development phase anyway. Their skillset may not match well with running a company with marketing and sales departments and getting the product sold.<p>Companies of the former type, like Facebook, are different because by the time they get real traction, they are already dealing with customers and are out there in the market.

Through no fault of their own they&#x27;ve been born in a country that doesn&#x27;t provide the same quality of life for them and their family that an American/EU resident enjoys. Don&#x27;t they have the right to the pursuit of happiness just like you?<p>&quot;Just an individual&quot; sweeps an immense bunch of important facts under the rug.  Countries do not acquire their standard of living <i>merely by luck</i>: their economies grow through systematic planning and coordination.<p>At the margins, moving one individual between countries does not appear to have a large systemic impact.  However, moving entire classes of individuals between countries usually results in one country dumping its externalities on another, thus misaligning the entire economic mechanism and resulting in deadweight losses as various ways to grow and improve get ignored.<p>A simple example: why should taxpayers in Germany, say, subsidize the training and education costs necessary to produce labor for American companies?  The American firms are capturing a positive public-good externality <i>from the Germans</i> while dumping a negative externality (deskilling) on their fellow Americans.  Since the externality producers in both countries are failing to capture the costs and benefits of their own productive activities, this is systematically unfair <i>by definition</i> (in the sense that &quot;capitalist unfairness&quot; consists of paying the costs and reaping the benefits of one&#x27;s own activities).",1421325555

The subjects reading from paper books were free to adjust their position however they wished.<p>In other tests, the paper version of a document was properly typeset while the electronic version was rendered in the ugliest font available, with hyphenation turned off.<p>I have yet to see a paper vs electronic study without odds stacked against the electronic reader.<p>&quot;Noyes and Garland’s experiment (2005) might account for the experience of long- time astronomy professor David Bruning, who believes that today’s digital native students no longer have the patience necessary to truly engage with and understand difficult reading material…&quot;<p>I wonder if the perceived shift in generational attention spans is due to over-abundance of entertainment material, a surplus of information, and perhaps our favourite medium of TV essentially training us to have thirty second attention spans?<p>But no, the report pins the blame on computers because they present information on an electronic screen.<p>&quot;As this article demonstrates, print books are still the best suited to the optical, cognitive, and metacognitive requirements of the reading brain. While e-paper technology has been shown to be the optical equivalent of print on paper, e-readers still are lacking in the physicality that has been shown to be so important for comprehension.&quot;<p>No, the article demonstrates nothing of the sort. The &quot;lack of physicality&quot; was based on a study which endeavoured to remove <i>all traces</i> of physicality from the electronic document: there was no pagination in the electronic document.<p>The article already addressed the issue that there are no components of the brain uniquely involved in reading, so the &quot;requirements of the reading brain&quot; is a furphy too!<p>The article can&#x27;t even agree with its own sources about the difference between written notes and typed notes:<p>&quot;Given the demonstrated physicality of reading, it seems likely that typing on a keyboard is, to the writing brain, the cognitive equivalent of reading virtual text, and therefore a more indirect and inferior way of achieving understanding.&quot;<p>versus<p>&quot;Recent experiments by psychologists Pam A. Mueller and Daniel M. Oppenheimer (2014) confirm that taking notes in cursive facilitates comprehension better than typing notes on a keyboard, possibly because the greater speed of typing leads to verbatim notes, while note taking in cursive tends to be a synthesis of content in a reader’s own words.&quot;<p>Noting that in the experiment where paper and electronic readers were required to study the texts for the same period of time, they got the same results, while in the experiment where both groups of readers were given as much time as they felt they needed, the electronic readers who were reading on computer screens finished sooner and as a consequence got worse results. Somehow this is a reflection on electronic books, rather than the difference in experience between reading a book that you hold in your hands versus a computer screen that remains in a fixed position, forcing the reader to sit at attention.<p>The issue of reader reluctance to flip backwards through pages on an electronic reader speaks more to the design of the electronic reader&#x27;s user experience than some innate value of electronic books. More research needs to be done there.<p>At best, this paper is a nice bibliography for further study by people interested in correcting some of the poor experimental design.<p>---<p>As far as anecdotes go: I am no longer comfortable reading from paper books. They are bulky, ungainly, and require me to orient myself in relation to an available light source. With a paper book, I can&#x27;t simply turn the ambient lighting up or down to a comfortable level and read where I want. Even worse, with a paper book, regardless of what markings and annotations I use, I am forced to remember where in the book the information is that I want. In an electronic book, I only need to remember which book contains the information I want. The electronic book reader will help me with the fine navigation.<p>I agree with the suggestion that handwritten notes encourage better learning outcomes, for exactly the reason suggested in this article (the quote earlier in my reply about hand written notes encouraging the student to rephrase the concept in their own words). Again, I don&#x27;t have any experimental evidence to support my supposition, so I&#x27;ll just cherry pick the study that supports my opinion :)",1421324206

In Europe, this structural split was a key part of the de-regulation of the telecoms market.<p>In the UK alone, OpenReach, the BT subsidiary that inherited the last mile network, counts more than 500 companies as customers that provide telecoms and ISP services to end-users. Many of them are business focused or offer only specific subsets of services, but there are a huge number of nationwide ISPs using OpenReach&#x27;s services.<p>Especially because the starting point is very simple: You can start out using their &quot;backhaul&quot; service which lets you integrate with OpenReach a couple of places and be able to offer broadband nationwide in the UK and have OpenReach provide you with IP connections to each customer for you to do whatever you want with. You can then if you want &quot;graduate&quot; to local loop unbundling where you put equipment in local exchanges as/when demand justifies it, allowing you to connect directly to the local loop (line) of each of your subscribers, which allows you to offer services in excess of what OpenReach does (e.g. some ISPs offer higher speeds).<p>Once you go the LLU route, you can turn around and offer backhaul services yourself if you wish, in competition with OpenReach.<p>If even that isn&#x27;t enough, and you have the capital, you can look at laying your own lines. E.g. in some cities we&#x27;re starting to see alternative fibre connections to many apartment buildings etc. as providers are capitalising on the density to bypass OpenReach.<p>So it encourages competition massively by creating a very low barrier to entry, while allowing larger providers to compete with OpenReach itself.",1421324052

During that lunch break, you could easily go for a 6km run (30-40 minutes), as well as have time for a shower, and grab food. If you&#x27;re prepared to have a faster shower, and eat a quick snack, heck, you could even make it a 10km run (50 minutes).<p>And depending on where you live, you might also be able to jog, or cycle to work - that&#x27;s probably another 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity, depending on how far. (I have a 15-minute cycle each way).<p>And maybe some mornings, you could get up early, and go for a swim, or go boxing or something.<p>Either way, I personally know many ordinary people who manage to get a healthy amount of exercise, and achieve their weight goals.<p>I also have a friend who quite honestly, eats what seems to be an incredibly unhealthy mix - think large amounts of junk food and deep-fried fast food. However, they manage to stay reasonably slim (think BMI 18) by doing insane amounts of exercise (several hours a day). So it&#x27;s definitely achievable, assuming you have that sort of willpower.<p>What studies are you referring to, that show that &quot;normal&quot; exercise will not cause weight loss?

And people are used to outsourced service companies dealing with utilities. E.g. I get power from Npower, and over the years a dozen different companies have done meter readings on their behalf where I live.<p>As for your &quot;Twinkle&quot; and &quot;Decker&quot; examples, blame your ISPs that have decided to use this as an excuse for their own problems. In the Twinkle example, the ISP is a customer of OpenReach, not you, it is their responsibility to deal with OpenReach, not yours. If they&#x27;re trying to push OpenReach in front of them, that&#x27;s their bad customer service.<p>As for your &quot;Decker&quot; example, it&#x27;s Decker&#x27;s fault they&#x27;ve not checked coverage prior to making promises they can&#x27;t keep. And &quot;aren&#x27;t allowed to run the fiber&quot; == &quot;we&#x27;ve decided (as most, but not all, UK ISPs) that OpenReach provides a good enough network for us, so we won&#x27;t make any investment in rolling out our own, sorry&quot;. Nothing prevents UK ISPs from trying to build competing networks, other than the capital investments needed, and the low projected rate of return for most of them outside of the most densely populated city cores.<p>The relative lack of competition for OpenReach is a good demonstration that the market doesn&#x27;t share your assessment of them.

I.e. this is a case of people being made maddest by statements they worry might be true.",1189089455

51074,comment,51042,51042,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"There was a piece at the new Institute for the Contemporary Arts in Boston. The whole exhibit had interplay with the digital side of life, but one of my faves was a blown up picture of a bomb exploding with very low compression quality. Those 8x8 bins so common to image compression routines were a few inches across. Looking close, it was easy to imagine an ideal, abstract contour in each 8x8 square, despite the clear picture from afar. I liked that effect a lot.<p>I think it was part of Super Vision, which looks to not be part of the permanent collection.\n<a href=""http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/supervision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/supervision/</a>",1189087522

64161,comment,64112,64140,0,0,matth,,,"<i>If you can't convince them this is the one idea they should work on maybe you need to change your idea.</i><p>Not necessarily. You can have a great idea and still have shaky cofounders. It doesn't automatically mean your idea sucks, cofounders can have any number of outside concerns that may prevent them from throwing their full weight behind your project. Job, wife, SO, children, mortgage, bills, school, etc.<p>And even then, your partners may not realize what a big idea you're sitting on. I think Robert Morris had little faith in Viaweb from the beginning. I guess that's how he ended up getting his ear pierced.",1191700697
64160,comment,64112,64140,0,0,Tichy,,,"I wouldn't mind to find a cofounder here (please contact me - I am located in the south of Germany). The problem with my friends is that they are not living in a startup culture. Where I live, everybody has a well-paying job, and startupping isn't the norm.  Basically, my friends somehow haven't read enough of Paul Graham's essays yet :-(<p>My best friend would probably come along as a co-founder, and he is a very good coder, whom I worked with on several projects before. But he works as a freelancer and just got an interesting offer for a new project. It might be a close chase...<p>Now about the idea: it is true that most of my friends didn't get overexcited when I told them about it. I think that is because it deals with a relatively new thing: build on demand hardware. It is only just starting off (Ponoko, eMachineShop, Apple and Dell online shops...), and people are simply not used to the idea. They think it is exotic and weird, but I think there is a fair chance that in relatively short time it will be really, really big.<p>Edit: I'll probably be at BarCamp Munchen tomorrow, in case any prospective co-founders want to talk...",1191700612

64155,comment,63702,64116,0,0,olavk,,,"Regarding Hungarian notation, it's really a kind of type system with explicit typing, except the type checking is done by the programmer reading the code rather than the compiler. Kind of the worst of the static and dynamic worlds combined.<p>He could solve the tainting problem by just wrapping the unsafe string in an object. This would be safer even in a dynamically typed language. His example is only relevant to very early versions of VBScript that didn't support classes. <p>Regarding exceptions, they are NOT supposed to be used for returning multiple values. They supposed to be used for exceptional results that cannot be handled locally. They don't have to be ""invisible"", e.g. in Java you <i>have</i> to either explicitly handle an exception or explicitly declare that you may propagate it. Using return values OTOH you may forget to handle a return value, and the compiler will not complain. His complaint is more valid wrt. C# where exceptions are indeed not checked by the compiler. But since he don't even seem to be aware of this difference, I'm pretty sure he knows about neither.",1191699873

When I found Google I instantly thought ""this is the greatest thing ever"". Within a month of owning a cell phone I knew I could never go back.<p>Facebook has been around a long time and still has nothing more compelling than turning people into vampires, and they have a ton of geniuses trying to figure it out. Its not only a perpetual novelty, but one which is apparently wearing off if you look at average visits per day per user.",1191699605

64147,story,,,2,2,cowmoo,"Ask YC: Should you go to graduate school?",,"I am currently a college CS senior. One of the biggest bind I am going through right now, is deciding whether I should go to graduate school for computer science. Like most people here, I am very much interested in applying CS to exciting and important problems in the everyday world. It would seem like then, I should just start heading out to either Cambridge/Seattle/The Valley.<p>The thing is after having worked at various tech companies, both small and Fortune 500, I realized that companies don't really push you to do research or learn on your own; it's all about ""bringing yesterday's technology one step closer to today"" and dumbed-down powerpoint presentations to the pointy-haired boss. <p>As for joining or founding a Web start-up, I have tried to launch a few sites with my college friends and honestly, I have come to a conclusion that copying-and-pasting php, playing with photoshop and dreamweaver isn't cutting-edge CS either; Web startups, IMHO, has become more about designs, social networking and hype. <p>Don't get me wrong. I don't want to sit in a closet office in the ivory tower, writing proofs about lambda calculus. But there's just this one paradox: 
I happen to see all of the new exciting area's in CS: Bioinformatics, data-mining of online community intelligence, computational finance all have graduate school as a barrier of entry; and yet it is the college/grad school dropouts (see every successful software/web company founder) that made it out of the ivory tower to make an actual difference. <p>So is there a third way out of this lesser of three evils, career IT corporate ladder, trendy style-over-substance web start-up's, academia ivory tower? Any ideas would be appreciated. <p>P.S I tend to use unnecessary adjectives for dramatic effect, I actually think anyone who is involved in IT/Web/CS  is a great person and I actually don't mean to offend anyone's professional or academic background.

So you move onto other questions, like what to write.<p>Response #2:<p>This statement is idiotic. Computer science is essential to the collection of technologies people call ""Web 2.0"".<p>The most advanced Web 2.0 sites allow for quick search across enormous databases, and efficient, many-to-many messaging. These problems are hard. Using the appropriate algorithm is essential to scalability.

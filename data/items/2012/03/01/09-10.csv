As often is with labour issues in Sweden, it's not dictated by law but by a voluntary agreement between unions and employer associations (called kollektivavtal, or the collective deal), but it is established in most all sectors. I know companies like McDonalds refused early on, but were forced to cave in due to strikes.<p>Of course a minimum wage will take away some jobs. Jobs that doesn't support your LIVING on those jobs. They suddenly become jobs for the sake of fueling companies, not jobs for the sake of sustaining yourself, which is sort of bizzarre.

3651481,comment,3651159,3651159,9,0,danieldk,,,"It's true that most natural languages cannot be parsed with a CFG, but he gives the wrong example. In fact, the language of the grammar that he describes can perfectly be generated by a CFG. E.g. for a rule such as:<p><pre><code>  sentence --> noun_phrase(Num), verb_phrase(Num).\n</code></pre>\nYou could create the CFG equivalent:<p><pre><code>  sentence --> noun_phrase_sg, verb_phrase_sg.\n  sentence --> noun_phrase_pl, verb_phrase_pl.\n</code></pre>\nIt sure is a drag, but this is how many CFG grammars/parsers work. Of course, it's generally agreed upon that DCGs generalize better even when used with grammars that can be described with a CFG.<p>Most natural languages are not context-free, but he gives the wrong example. To provide a more convincing example - in Dutch you can construct phrases like:<p><i>dat ik Marie Jan de dozen zie helpen inpakken</i> (lit: <i>that I Marie Jan the boxes see helping packing</i>)<p>The NPs and the verbs correspond in the following manner: ik - zie, Marie - helpen, Jan - Inpakken. Or, more formally, the structure is: np_a np_b np_c np_x v_a v_b v_c. Of course, this highly resembles a COPY language, which cannot be expressed using a CFG, but (obviously!) can be expressed using a DCG:<p><pre><code>  s(L) --> w(L), w(L)\n  w([a|Rst]) --> [a], w(Rst).\n  w([b|Rst]) --> [b], w(Rst).\n  w([]) --> []\n</code></pre>\n(This grammar parses/generates a string of zero or more a's and b's, followed by exactly the same string.)",1330593707

3651473,comment,3650743,3651108,5,0,lysium,,,"Although time is an important data in most applications, there is only poor library support for it. Most languages don't even have a data type for time!<p>For example, the system call gettimeofday(2) does only return the seconds since Jan 1, 1970 (the 'epoch'), the time zone and the daylight saving time correction. No day, no month, no year. For this, you have to call some other function, eg. libc' localtime(3).<p>libc's time(3) function says it returns the number of seconds since the epoch, but it ignores leap seconds, so it actually does not return the number of seconds since the epoch (since there have been several leap seconds since the epoch).<p>Even if you use localtime(3) to get the actual wall clock hour and minutes, you are left on your own from there. Want to have a time point two hours from now? Do your own math, but watch out for the end of the day, which might also be the end of the month and/or the end of the year. One month from now? Do your own math, but watch out for months that have less days than your current month.<p>You may want to resort to do calculations only in seconds since the epoch, but how many seconds are in a month? Depends on the month (and the year as we've just learned!). In a year? Depends on the year (Is it a leap year? Was / will be there a leap second? Do you have to care about leap seconds?).<p>I just picked the C language because it is so prevalent. Other languages have their own issues or inherit them from C. In Python, for example, there is a timedelta object, but it can only handle days, seconds, and microseconds, so you still cannot calculate the date one month from now or one year ago.<p>I find it unbelievably funny that it's 2012 and we still have to deal with this 'solved problem'. Turns out, it is not solved at all.",1330593346

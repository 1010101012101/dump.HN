It is the inability of anyone to say no to shitty paying jobs that requires the existence of minimum wage laws in the first place. As long as people can&#x27;t say no, because they need the income to survive, they will say yes to shitty wages, hours, benefits, etc.<p>This author should ask himself, if he earned $1k/money for breathing, would he accept a shitty job for $7/hr? If not, how much would it need to pay before he would accept?<p>Then the next question is what the effective wage of automation would be. If because people have basic income, no one will work that job for less than $15/hr and a machine can do it for $10/hr, then it now makes more sense to automate that job out of existence.<p>And that is the direction we should aim for as a civilization - full unemployment, not full employment. Humans should hand as many jobs to machines as we can, to free us up to do the work we each feel is most valuable, paid or unpaid.<p>Enough with this pro-toil mentality that sees value in everyone being employed, even if for only 4 hrs a week in order to employ 100% of the population. As if that is even possible anyway. Like what, we&#x27;re going to have 10 doctors share the work load of one doctor so that everyone can be employed? And what of all the work that goes unpaid? We should just keep not recognizing that? And what of all the jobs that don&#x27;t need to exist? We should keep those around so that people can fill them to prove their right to live?<p>Full employment in the 21st century is a bullshit goal. We as a species are better than that. Our goal should be to free ourselves to pursue what we each wish to pursue.<p>And anyone who thinks people&#x27;s ability to organize will be in any way diminished instead of monumentally expanded with basic income, isn&#x27;t giving their fellow man enough credit.<p>People will use basic income to give themselves greater voice.

The experiment, known as ‘Mincome’, was jointly bankrolled by the then provincial New Democratic government and Pierre Trudeau’s Liberals, and offered an unconditional annual income to every family. Those that worked had their Mincome cut by 50 cents for every dollar earned. The idea was to offer a cushion for shifting crop prices or crop failures. The governments were interested to see whether such a support would produce a disincentive to work, a town full of lay-abouts. If successful, the long game was to roll out a similar plan nationwide. But the scheme ended up costing $17 million, much more than had been envisaged. It was scrapped as recession hit Canada at end of the decade. Almost 2000 boxes’ worth of data on the trial were packed away, not to be heard from again until University of Manitoba health sciences researcher Evelyn Forget tracked them down in 2009.<p>She found that there was essentially no reduction in working hours with two notable exceptions: women who were mothers of young children, or had elderly or disabled relatives and who were now choosing to stay home, and teenagers, who now felt free to continue in school and not help out their parents on the farm. Meanwhile, there were fewer work-place injuries, fewer car accidents, less domestic abuse and hospital visits declined by 8.5 percent.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1446881142

They&#x27;re parameterized on type, but I&#x27;m pretty sure those types can&#x27;t affect the runtime behavior by, say, specifying their own hash or comparison function.

Doing this can tell you who can help you improve, or maybe you identify role models, appreciate a good mentor, etc...  Or it can show you who you might be able to help.  Sometimes we all need some help.<p>The real battle is in how you define your sense of worth.  Take smarts, for example.  In your life, you are going to encounter people smarter than you are, as well as not as smart, or maybe you can&#x27;t really tell.  What does that really mean?<p>Think about being smart enough.  One artifact of that thought could be what you accomplish boils down to how willing you are to do the work to actually accomplish it.  Being willing is very high value!  Suddenly, how smart you are isn&#x27;t a defining attribute.  Your intent and resolve are.<p>Another artifact of that might be the realization that smart people &quot;rub off&quot;  If you want to improve, being around people better than you is an excellent way to do that, and feeling inadequate gets in the way of all that too.  Think back on that intent and resolve and maybe you realize everyone who wants to do stuff with their life has those things and is sharing them with others who appreciate it.  Going further, many people respond favorably to someone they see doing the work to get after those big things, whatever they are.  And there should be no shame in any of that at all.<p>Extend that a bit more, and suddenly those comparisons have value!  Hard working people rub off.  Social people rub off.  Etc...<p>What you need to do is absorb unabashedly.  As you encounter others who are compelling in some way, watch and learn!  Make a few friends.  Those people know it&#x27;s OK to be who they are, as should you.  Those people are doing the work, making the friends, showing good intent.  As should you.<p>Do the work and trust in yourself.  Get help when you need it.  Give help when others need it.  Treat yourself with the same respect you would others you admire or believe you can learn from.<p>In fact, cultivate a sense of respect.  Mutual respect.  When you demonstrate this, people most often return it.  And if it&#x27;s your intent to do that, work hard, get something you believe in done, people will most often return that too, and in that process you become one of those people you are comparing yourself to.<p>Give with honest, good intent, and &#x27;ye shall receive.<p>You aren&#x27;t stuck behind anybody.  You are where you are, and it&#x27;s up to you to move forward and do what you want with your life.  What you are doing here is looking at younger peers who made different choices and you are wishing you had made those same choices.  Or you are buying the bullshit they are selling.<p>A great many people never, ever really figure out what they want to do with their life.  Often, they are too busy living it, having fun, building, doing, playing to think about it.  Others are driven, focused, intent.<p>So you&#x27;ve arrived at some life goal!  Good for you.  Now quit your regrets and start getting after it, whatever it is.  There will always be others who seem better positioned, or whatever.  It&#x27;s not about any of that.  There are people who are worse off, or more poorly positioned too.<p>Do you want to be here?  Do you care about other people, the world, and the things you find in it?  Great!  That&#x27;s all anyone requires as justification to be here.  No joke.  Be sure and share that often.  People like other people who care.  People value others who care too.<p>Share that thing you want to do with others, and ask them what it is they are wanting to do as well.  Maybe you can help, or maybe it&#x27;s good to just listen and appreciate they are doing something they care about.  Maybe you have a common goal.<p>Maybe you can realize that&#x27;s all any of us are doing, you included.<p>Like I said, give and &#x27;ye shall receive.<p>One great way to feel better about yourself is to help others, and the doing of that does wonders for your own sense of worth.  Do it.  Clear that mess out of your head and free yourself to get after it, whatever it is.

It seems odd that we&#x27;re happy to take care of kids for free (or highly subsidized cost) from the age from 6 to 16 -- but somehow the years 1-6 needs to be paid for by parents? Are those 4 years really so much more expensive, that it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to just roll that all up into one budget?<p>I actually need to look at the arguments around this in Norway -- free school from the age of 6 to 18, along with a free college education isn&#x27;t really an issue - and full coverage of child care services also have broad agreement -- but somehow simply making said childcare free seems to be much more contentious. Or perhaps just overlooked.<p>I suppose one could make up microeconomic arguments along the lines of a solid education for all benefits all, while allowing <i>all</i> parents those extra 3-4 per child in the job market might not benefit all. Perhaps more interesting is the general trend that there&#x27;s <i>less work</i> -- so having people spend some time off from work (with eg: pay from the government) might simply be a more efficient model going forward.<p>But if we accept that free primary school is a good thing, I don&#x27;t see how we can argue that free kinder garden isn&#x27;t too.",1446880458

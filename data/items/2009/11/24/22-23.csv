Instead of leveling up your character, the skilling-up mechanism is memorizing the hazards in the levels; with enough patience the player memorizes the pattern and repeats back the appropriate response and wins.

All we are asking for is for the user to login and if they find article they like (on the front page or from the topics menu) then click on them. What more simple that that? The voting system up/down you talk about is exactly the same except that you explicitly ask the user to vote, while we implicitly do the same.\nTechnologyReview ran an article last year how asking the user to explicitly rate stuff is considered overburdening and how the system should quietly monitor the user without asking direct questions.

The problem is that all of the corners cut early on begin to accumulate, and major design issues quickly become daily maintenance headaches once something is in production and up to the point of ""pitching"". What is more likely to happen is you will have a bunch of basic stuff that is relatively easy to implement and any advanced/killer features will become very hard to implement, and most of the effort will just go in to keeping it going, rather than improving it.<p>Chances are, taking the quick-and-dirty approach won't get to the deadline either, it will just show pieces of early functionality earlier, but wont have a foundation to get to the solid product.<p>The early development you do is laying a foundation, while you are in that phase, you can still scrap pieces of it wholesale and rewrite it, but once you start building on that foundation, you will not be able to make a skyscraper if you are building it on a tar pit lined with tin foil.<p>And ""best practices"" (TDD,agile,whatever) are no guarantee that you will get it right, either.",1259100141

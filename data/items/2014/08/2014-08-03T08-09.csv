In fact that&#x27;s the entire premise of the field <i>learning from data</i>. Of course you need good quality data and in sufficient quantity.<p>Your model will almost never be perfect but you can evaluate confidence intervals by using part of the past data (training set) and making prediction for events that is not included in that data (test set) and find out how good is your model. This process is scattered with land mines. People frequently end up overfitting or do not take in to account variability trends or power laws or possible &quot;black swans&quot;. So all such models you want to take with grain of salt in any case.<p>For this particular case, I don&#x27;t think we have enough data yet to make predictions with significant confidence. From past epidemics in same region, it will very likely that this will end without getting out of control. One of the big deal about current strain is that it doesn&#x27;t manifest symptoms until 1-3 weeks which gives plenty of time for virus to spread.<p>One should never discount the power of power law. We are safe only until tipping point is not researched. I think that tipping point is about 10,000 infected people in a city. If this happens, it would take extreme measures to prevent spread (something like completely isolating entire countries). But by that time, virus might have already escaped elsewhere.",1407055958
8127467,comment,8124919,8125319,1,0,Natsu,,,"There are various interests in play, but what prompted the movement was the idea that ISPs were going to start billing websites to provide unrestricted access to their customers and invert the web.  That idea was nearly universally condemned online and the first few people who came up to name a movement contrary to that called it net neutrality and started trying to come up with principles to fit what had horrified so many people.<p>So the basic idea behind it is that ISPs shouldn&#x27;t be able to indirectly charge content providers by threatening to block or restrict their content when it&#x27;s requested by the ISPs customers.  In other words, ISPs have no legitimate business meddling with other peoples&#x27; businesses, but different people have different ideas about what it is or isn&#x27;t now.",1407055881

It seems reasonable that cannabis can trigger underlying illness, or exacerbate existing illness.  So while I am strongly in favour of legalising drugs I am still concerned about possible harms from cannabis.<p>Researching this is difficult.

Chips like the Freescale MK20 are about the same price as the atmega328, have had the arduino framework ported to them, and have capabilities like acting as a USB host. The AVR was, and for certain needs still is, a compelling platform, but at the same time, it is starting to severely date itself.",1407054062

This is bad if the abuse is bad for the user.<p>I'm echoing the idea that increased production doesn't necessarily entail increased happiness due to second order effects.<p>One scenario: a lot of those WoW players can play so much because their parents have worked very hard.  But, they play so much because they don't have good relationships with their parents, since their parents spent so much time working hard.<p>Then there is the issue of whether the level of production is sustainable, and what happens to a society dependent upon such activity if it stops or slows.  Also, what kind of class attitudes develop with the societal stratification.",1205128534

So you need someone who is 1) financially able to make such an investment, 2) a savvy enough investor to be able to assess whether or not your company is worth investing in (or foolish enough to make the investment without due diligence) and 3) able (and willing) to program. ""<p>Dead on.<p>I heard this observation from a designer who had been asked to take on a contract for stock. From his point of view it was the same as being paid cash, then turning around and investing all that money in that company.  And, base on what (little) he knew, there was no clear reason to think it would be a sound investment; it was pretty much a crap shoot.<p>Put another way, if you simply had that cash lying around, would you invest it in that start-up?",1205128263

Trying to create a startup mentality within a corporation is like trying to create a festive mood at a wake. It comes down to motivations. Early stage startup founders are motivated because the rewards for being successful are potentially high, and the cost of failure is at worst some ego and time wasted.<p>Some corporations try to instill a startup mentality in their employees by letting them propose product ideas and by doing some of the implementation on company time. I'm not sure how they reward these employees, and I'm not sure how motivated these employees would remain if they come up with a million dollar idea, but only get a $50 gift card for their troubles.<p>In the end there is no substitute for a real startup.",1205127997

Many nootropic drugs work either by stimulating the production of, or blocking the absorption of, otherwise normally occurring brain chemicals.<p>I believe, for example, that  methylphenidate (Ritalin) stimulates the production of dopamine, while bupropion (Wellbutrin) blocks dopamine reuptake.<p>I used to do a fair amount of wetware hacking, and one of the concerns was avoiding the crash that comes when your brain is depleted of one or another chemical.<p>One path to a better brain, then, is to feed it the material it needs to produce the more interesting (noradrenalin, dopamine, etc.) stuff.",1205127896

I want policies for how to live that function reasonably well even for people who have flaws and sometimes act unreasonably (aka everyone). In other words, one of the major features I look for in a philosophy of education, or of life in general, is resilience to errors. So far, I think we are in agreement.<p>But you seem to have brought up your own imperfection as a point of possible disagreement. I'm guessing that has more to do with this other issue:<p><i>The fundamental issue is that if you can't persuade someone of your ideas, that is a bad reason to force him.</i><p>Here your comments about different ways people can be unreasonable are important. If a problem is due to someone's ignorance then it makes sense that good ideas can solve the problem. Ideas clearly are capable of reducing ignorance.<p>If it's a problem of akrasia, lack of self control, emotions run wild, or solidly entrenched bad ideas, then what to do is less clear. What if the person, adult or child, won't listen to reason? If what he wants isn't based a reasoned decision then why would reason change his mind?<p>I have some answers to those questions. But first I want to check in to see if you agree so far, and if this is the sort of question you are interested in.<p>PS FYI I might potentially be able to give a more helpful reply in private; I try to avoid personal comments in public about both myself and others.",1205125358

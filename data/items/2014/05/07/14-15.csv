Most ratings cover the simplistic &quot;I saw the movie and this is how I feel about it&quot; kind of data. In that case, the ratings can be useful.<p>But if a group with an agenda comes in and rates the movie on a different set of criteria without letting the typical reader know renders the data useless.",1399474746
7710506,comment,7709567,7710227,6,0,jorleif,,,"While this is true, I would argue that there is a social expectation that an IMDB review is written by someone who has seen the movie. Especially, it is expected to be true on average with the usual &quot;few bad apples&quot; thrown in the mix. In this case, this expectation does not hold, and in this sense these reviews are truly anomalous (they are produced by a different process than the other ones). From the perspective of the expected usage of the reviews this anomaly is indeed possible to see as an error, rather than just slightly different behavior.",1399474730

Funnily, the language that taught me all that was Python.<p>As willvarfar points out, I feel Rob Pike is being disingenous when he talks about this. Golang uses less significant whitespace than Python, but it exists, the difference is in degree. If he prefers to minimize the impact of whitespace in Go code, that&#x27;s fine. But why does he have to talk about it as an error or misjudgment?<p>If significant whitespace is such a bad idea, why do exist keywords that require whitespace around them in Go (package, func, type, etc.?

They tend to be net tax drains, in fact. 5) The native population overwhelmingly favors much reduced immigration, but powerful interests press for more.<p>The only way this disastrous situation will get fixed is with a year zero restart.

One of those was Poul Henning Kamp, that have mentioned OpenSSL as a problem in many talks before Heartbleed was discovered. He is not alone. It is also quite well known that OpenSSL have had a unusually high number vulnerabilities in its history, mostly because its low quality. I have read the code, even before the heartbleed bug was introduced, and I was not surprised that this could happen. Some of the code that lead to the heartbleed bug was made to bypass security measures done by the operating systems to make it hard to exploit such vulnerabilities, and the maintainers did this instead of fixing the problem.<p>So why have nobody fixed them. I guess one of the reason is that the codebase is broken beyond repair, and it was not just to &quot;provide patches&quot;. In fact a major rewrite or reworking of the code was required, and this is what the people behind LibreSSL currently are doing.<p>Another reason is that people (and companies) generally are not willing to pay for security, and does not know when something is secure or not. Thus for something that works, but is insecure, the incentive for doing something about it is missing. Security vulnerabilities is only theoretical for most people.",1399473338

It would be very easy for me to get a few friends together and make a 90 minutes improvised movie filmed on my phone. That would be an absolutely terrible movie, but it wouldn&#x27;t be a very satisfying answer to the question &quot;What&#x27;s the worst movie?&quot; because it would be seen by very few people and it would be made with no ambition of quality. I could go further and make a movie that was 90 minutes of a black screen. That would be a worse movie but an even less satisfying answer.<p>Even if you limit the field to movies that have seen a theatrical release, the same principal applies. Some movies are shockingly bad, but are made with few little effort by people who know they are making a bad movie. These seem less interesting, less sad and less funny than very bad movies made by people trying very hard and spending lots of money.<p>Personally, when rating the badness of work, I judge it against my own assessment of the potential of the work. The potential isn&#x27;t directly measurable or quantifiable, but it consists of things like the budget, the vision of the creator, the skill and effort of the artists involved in the creation, etc. etc.<p>So, for example, I think of Star Wars: Episode 1 as being a worse film than a lot of 50s low-budget sci-fi B-movies, even though I might choose to watch it more readily. The B-movies were pumped out without much effort. They&#x27;re boring and poorly made on a technical level, but they never really had a chance to be any good. Episode 1 was made on a vast budget, drew on extremely rich source material, and was the culmination of unimaginable amounts of time and effort by a large number of hard-working people.

7710230,comment,7709567,7710088,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"Rotten Tomatoes does contain different information, and different statistics. For example, take Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.<p>IMDb gives a 6.9/10 from 119,115 users. That&#x27;s the only real statistic it gives us; there is no &#x27;Metascore&#x27; for this movie. (Personally I think the Oscar nomination should be mentioned next to this score, but it&#x27;s sort of buried further down the page)<p>Rotten Tomatoes, on the other hand, shows us several numbers. The Tomatometer is at 50% for &quot;All Critics&quot;, with an average rating of 5.7/10 and 52 reviews. The &quot;Top Critics&quot; Tomatometer is at 36%, with an average rating of 5.9/10 and 14 reviews. The Audience rating, however, is 73%, with an average rating of 3.4/5 from 333,273 users.<p>--<p>The above example shows how you can sometimes use IMDb&#x27;s stats of general ratings as a median reference between the audience numbers and critics numbers. But this doesn&#x27;t always paint the best picture. Let&#x27;s take another example: the recent (and generally accepted as a flop) 47 Ronin.<p>Here, IMDb gives us a 6.3/10 rating from 60,849 users. But it also gives a Metascore of 29/100. Yet the number in a gold star in bigger font is just the &#x27;6.3&#x27;. So even though this movie has a dramatically lower Metascore, they only feature the general user rating from IMDb.<p>The story is much more dramatic on Rotten Tomatoes. It has a 13% &#x27;All Critics&#x27; Tomatometer rating from 72 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The &#x27;Top Critics&#x27; Tomatometer shows 0% with 13 reviews and an average rating of 2.9/10; not one single top critic liked this film, out of 13 critics! Yet the audience rating shows 51% with an average of 3.3/5 with 53,921 ratings.<p>We can see how IMDb got its &#x27;6.3&#x27; rating here: both seem to show a middle-of-the-road rating from general audience ratings. But Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; critics stats show this movie isn&#x27;t worth wasting two hours of your life on. The gamble of whether you may like the movie or not becomes more certainly <i>less likely</i> when you take the critics&#x27; reviews into consideration.<p>--<p>As we can see above, even within each website, sometimes they have not only greatly varying statistics, but sometimes missing or hidden information (Robin Hood not having a Metacritic rating and not prominently displaying the oscar nod). People weigh their options based on the data they have at hand, so the information you give people - along with its context - will change their minds greatly, regardless of the source.<p>This is why I think it&#x27;s much more realistic to look at multiple different sites. You need as much information as you can get, and no one site gives you all the relevant data, as it varies from film to film and user community to user community. It would seem you can&#x27;t just depend on &#x27;the crowd&#x27; to give someone an accurate idea of whether they will like a film; a survey would probably be better, but nobody&#x27;s going to survey every film they watch.",1399472204

This is not a documentary to put the truth on the screen (I am not sure how much of the movie is fiction).<p>I think the author calls data erroneous as the rating does not represent the actual quality of the movie - a thing which IMDB wants to achieve. He doesn&#x27;t call it erroneous for actual errors in the process of collecting ratings.<p>I think, as you said, you are just inclined to seek more nuances.",1399471302

Leaving people who deliberately, intentionally review movies. Those ratings would be of an entire different class.",1399471299

Though I would say this is <i>partly</i> because teachers and administrators arent trained properly.<p>I agree it does have a UI which dates back a decade and consequently not a very good UX, However moodle HQ is well aware of this problem and I expect them to crank out better UI/UX in newer versions.

7710145,comment,7708939,7708939,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;m of mixed minds about this. On one hand, if your CEO isn&#x27;t smart enough to appreciate engineering, R&D, and the cultural needs of high talent, you&#x27;ll never get anywhere. The long-term result of having a business-driven technical organization isn&#x27;t having a lower talent level. It&#x27;s losing all the talent.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s really simplistic to assume that engineers are &quot;the good guys&quot; and that having an engineer-turned-CEO will guarantee an engineer-driven organization. There are plenty of self-hating, Benedict Arnold engineers who&#x27;ll gladly sell technology out to management. For some reason, a substantial portion of the engineers who become executives are that kind, and I don&#x27;t know why, but it gives the good engineers who move into leadership a bad name.",1399471207

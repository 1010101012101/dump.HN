Interoperability code with some library or the OS.<p>2. C as the closest thing to a portable assembler there is (e.g. to implement something like the Ruby interpreter).<p>What I need for this isn&#x27;t perfect safety; it&#x27;s the ability to reason with some confidence about the code I&#x27;m writing (I may want to be able to rely on code review by merely mortal programmers or create my own tools to enforce this). If I wanted a safe, expressive language, I wouldn&#x27;t use C in the first place.<p>But right now even something as simple as a malloc implementation is riddled with traps even for reasonably skilled programmers. The Linux kernel uses -fno-strict-overflow and the FreeBSD kernel uses -fwrapv because the price to be paid by enabling the undefined behavior of -fstrict-overflow was too high.",1451959192

It&#x27;s important to call out bad practices where they exist.  Not having good comments and test cases for intended behavior is a bad practice.  Yes, in the real world, plenty of code gets shipped without adhering to these practices, but it&#x27;s really unfortunate to see someone talked down on for showing where good practices could have prevented the current circumstances.

If so, keep in mind that the prices insurance companies pay for procedures are not designed to make sense on an individual level[0].<p>I&#x27;ve explained this in more detail on previous comments, but basically, hospitals lose money on publicly-insured patients (Medicare/Medicaid), and so they have to make up the difference by overcharging private insurers. This is why the sticker price for procedures is so heavily inflated - they&#x27;re intended to be the starting point for negotiation, and the insurers then negotiate standard rates (still inflated, but less so) for in-network providers.<p>In other words, the amount that your insurer had to pay for your ECG includes an amortization of the amount of excess cost that your insurer bears in order to (effectively) subsidize the patients on public insurance.<p>In theory, this should not affect your out-of-pocket costs (though of course, in the end, it all does come out of patients fixed monthly premiums, so you still are paying for it in some way).<p>Yes, this is unnecessarily complicated, but that&#x27;s the way billing works.<p>[0] That is not to say that the amount that the insured <i>patients</i> pay for procedures shouldn&#x27;t make sense on an individual level - just the amount that the insurer pays on top.",1451958391

Tor&#x27;s original design was only for low-latency anonymity. Circumvention was initially a side-effect of Tor functioning as a (very slow) proxy for its users, and later dedicated circumvention features were added (unlisted bridges, obfsproxy, etc) to make Tor more durable in hostile environments, for the purpose of making the anonymity features more available, which of course reinforces the side-effect of Tor being useful for circumvention.<p>Most recently, the rendezvous system and hidden services have been particularly powerful in reducing censorship on the end of content publishers, but this feature was added two years in, it is an area in which Tor performs significantly more poorly than, e.g., i2p, and very few people are actually talking about this when they discuss using Tor for censorship evasion.<p>I love the Tor project, but people should understand that it is an anonymity system, not an anti-censorship system. When you are facing censorship on your end (the reader&#x27;s end) and do not require anonymity, just use a SOCKS proxy or a VPN. They&#x27;re radically faster, often easier to use, and there are a million different options for evading blocking and detection - using DNS queries as a covert channel is a popular one, but the sky&#x27;s the limit.<p>If you need to evade censorship on the publisher&#x27;s end, then this generally comes down to an anonymity problem (the publisher must remain anonymous for their protection) and so onion-routing becomes a reasonable approach. This is relatively uncommon, though, and I believe people should more strongly invest in other projects that originally built around this goal, rather than having it added later. Some of these are more robust against attempts at direct censorship (rather than just punishing the creator) as well, as Tor is relatively centralized.",1451958020

(To be sure 60 is also a beautiful number but its ratio of factors to non-factors is of course lesser.) I can see you gearing up to argue that 6 is more beautiful, and I get that. I really do. But the ability to evenly divide into quarters is just so ... pleasant :)<p>Does the ability to divide evenly in several ways serve as a soapbox from which to argue that it is mathematically important to memorize the first 12 numbers of which 12 is a factor? I suppose not. But could we simply do 12 the honor of learning these two extra columns of the multiplication table because it is beautiful?

10840332,comment,10835853,10835853,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"1. Bots become more prevalent on the business end<p>Developers and designers work best when they&#x27;re not interrupted. Asynchronous communication enables workers to ride the flow when they&#x27;re focused and address communication when they take a break. A bot that requests a daily status, collects results throughout the day, and summarizes them would save the time wasted in unnecessary meetings without sacrificing communication.<p>Managers tend to piss off their workers because they perceive their time as more valuable and expect their workers to drop everything for a status update. Bots have no ego, can collect all the necessary data, without being intrusive.<p>That&#x27;s just one example. Why are we still paying people to manually aggregate data? Bots can and should be used for menial/repetitive work.<p>I think startups will start to popup to &#x27;spread the bot love&#x27; to our less-technical business counterparts.<p>2. ChatOps and greater cross-platform integration<p>Microservices are on the rise, everybody is talking in REST, and ChatOps is becoming the backbone of successful organizations. Slack is a good example of this. What it can&#x27;t integrate with by default it can be extended with using bots or glue services like Zapier.<p>It&#x27;s time we ditch the push/pull models of communication. It doesn&#x27;t scale and it&#x27;s too easy for bad actors to game the system. Work, progress, and status should be tracked passively and in the open. No more lazy people hiding from their responsibilities, no more bad actors advancing by kissing ass and taking credit for other&#x27;s work.<p>Many sites/services have been exposing public APIs with a &#x27;build it and they will come&#x27; mentality. It&#x27;s about damn time we tap those resources.<p>3. Unikernels will start to be used in production<p>For stateless webservices, it simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to use a full-featured general purpose OS. A unikernel drastically reduces the surface area for security vulnerabilities, requires zero maintenance, requires very little memory/space overhead, and is small enough to fit in version control.<p>Docker containers will live on as a scaleable approach for &#x27;pets&#x27;, unikernels will start to emerge as a replacement for &#x27;cattle&#x27;.<p>To take this a step further. If we&#x27;re running a service that doesn&#x27;t require mutable state, why the hell are we running it on a mutable operating system?<p>DevOps is expensive and difficult to setup. Organizations that figure out how to embrace this new approach will be able to move fast and <i></i>not<i></i> break things..<p>-----<p>Bonus: Anti-trends<p>1. TDD will be on the decline<p>Devs start to question whether TDD is just another form of &#x27;waterfall&#x27; model. If we collectively agreed that making a ton of assumptions up front before starting development is a bad idea, why has that practice been pushed into the testing domain.<p>The important question to ask isn&#x27;t, &quot;how much test coverage do we have?&quot; It should be, &quot;how many tests are we throwing away?&quot;<p>On a short timescale, startups will start looking to &#x27;trim the fat&#x27;.<p>2. We reach &#x27;peak mobile app&#x27;<p>Apple has been coasting on the success of mobile since the passing of Steve Jobs. They&#x27;re betting the future on mobile at the expense of everything else.<p>Safari has become the new IE and the updates to OSX have been lackluster. OSX is the preferred platform for a large percentage of Developers/Designers and nothing pisses them off more than watching their favorite tools/ecosystem fall by the wayside. Resentment toward Apple will grow.<p>To make matters worse, both React and Angular2 are aggressively pushing to be the platform of both the web and mobile. UI responsive issues have been resolved with the VDOM, and they&#x27;ve effectively built architectures that separate the application from the UI rendering layer.<p>Mobile has never been scalable from a business sense. There&#x27;s only a limited amount of screen real estate for apps. Mobile development strongly favors the few at the expense of the many. Plus, proprietary platform lock-in sucks. The mobile app ecosystem will contract as well as any -- but the most successful -- startups that depend on it.<p>3. &#x27;Nobody ever got fired for purchasing Oracle&#x27; will become a past time<p>Amazon AWS is aggressively pushing to eat Oracle&#x27;s lunch. With the recent launch of services that achieve feature parity with Oracle&#x27;s db as well as tools that assist the migration, Oracle will be on the decline. Not to mention, the business world finally overwhelmingly accepted the cloud as the future in 2015. Amazon AWS is the sleeping giant that just woke up holding a can of whoop ass in one hand and a can opener in the other.<p>Startups that specialize in data migration to the cloud will be flush with cash.",1451957723

The whole point is that they&#x27;re useful, though.<p>Haskell doesn&#x27;t have mutable state; it still has closures.<p>Mutable or immutable is somewhat orthogonal; I admit, coming from Erlang to Javascript I was -shocked- and very facepalmy when I learned that closures close over variables that can still vary. That is, I couldn&#x27;t just pass back a function and expect it to behave the same way depending when I called it. I had to add an additional scope in place and bind the values anew (i.e., a new function, passing the values being closed over into it as params). Immutable is much easier to reason about, much easier to write with, and despite being more limited in what you can do with them, I&#x27;d argue just as useful. Everything it prevents you from doing there is some other, safe way of achieving; the same as comparing mutable vs immutable in other contexts.",1451955613

In Italy it&#x27;s less than 50%, while in Spain less than 20%.<p>Just a note: After wikipedia in 2013, world production of virgin olive oil was 2.8 million tonnes. Spain produced 1.1 million tonnes, or 39% of world production in this year whereas in Greece the production of virgin olive oil was only 0.31 million tonnes. Therefore, please note that with your data both countries will produce almost the same amount of liters of extra virgin in fact.<p>If you find that in Spain less than 20% of the virgin olive oil is extra, this is a good thing, not bad. Means that if you read &quot;extra virgin&quot; in the tag is top quality. Only the best of the best can be tagged as extra virgin (More than 80% of the candidates are eliminated in the process). Of course, the controlled and &#x27;low&#x27; production is also a marketing strategy to keeping prices of this premium product always high. Spain could produce much more bottles of extra virgin if they wanted to do so.<p>After wikipedia: Extra-virgin olive oil accounts normally for less than 10% of oil produced (extra-virgin + virgin + refined + pomace) so to find extra-virgin produced in California should be currently difficult, but the percentage is 80% in Greece, 65% in Italy and 50% in Spain and is not difficult to find in the european markets. Is just that is not cheap.",1451955603

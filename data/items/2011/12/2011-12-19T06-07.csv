IMO, this is extremely narrow-minded, and entirely sidesteps the most important part of the RPG acronym: the R and P, standing for role-playing.<p>That said, just role-playing is not enough to make an RPG (otherwise, all games would be RPG's!).

It can vary by county, township, inside/outside city limits, and in all these different combinations (literally thousands for the whole country) what items are subject to sales tax varies region by region too. For example, most states don't tax web design service, but there are a few that do. Most states don't tax advertising services, but a few do, and it depends what type of advertising is being bought.<p>Passing on an address and a total to an API will do the trick 99% of the time, but technically, some of the businesses using that API are going to fail to collect sales tax in some cases where they should.<p>I am hopeful that if enough state legislatures get serious about taxing internet sales, they'll band together to do some nationwide standardization. That kind of thing can't come down from the federal government; congress has no authority to tell a local municipality it can't levy its own sales tax, but state governments can.

Many VC's eat these folks for lunch like Hollywood eats wannabe movies stars. I met a guy who said that after his first startup he felt like some young kid who came out to act and settled for a role in an adult film, only to have all the proceeds go to the producer and a reputation sullied by is previous 'history.' His startup had a good exit, for the VCs but was considered 'poorly executed' so he took the heat.<p>I've met older engineers who were amazing creative forces to be reckoned with in their 'day' but are now stuck in a bitter, curmudgeonly loop rebelling against new technologies because they 'add no value over the old way which still works fine thank you very much.' They get reviews they don't understand, things like 'stuck in your ways, not a team player, argumentative.'<p>Flashy loud mouth hipsters reflect badly on young entrepreneurs and bitter engineers reflect badly on older engineers. Its not like you can change that though.<p>All you can do is take an engineer, listen to their ideas and observe their work, and if they are good it will show. If they are past their sell by date, that will show too. And if they are more air than insight, well that comes out pretty quickly too.<p>One thing I've come to appreciate is how dangerous a generalization can be.",1324275487

They just need some plug-in or whatever to check their DNS against an uncensored one and their geek friends will probably be passing such things around in less than a week.  I think someone <i>already made that program</i> actually, so I think the blocks are likely to be ineffective before they start.<p>That myth that ""this will make it hard for the 99%"" thing has been trotted out during every single anti-piracy failure ever.  (There have been no lasting successes.)  Once the ""smart cow"" opens the barn door for everyone else, it's open.  Every single cow can just walk right out and it will be too late when you go to close it.  It's like we're playing a game where we flip a fair coin.  Heads, I win.  Tails, we flip it again.  And yet people still think that maybe next time it will work.<p>Think we can make it up with even harsher punishments?  Well, the Great Firewall of China leaks like a sieve.  Incidentally, they also use a form of DNS blocking, as I understand it (something like spoofed NXDOMAIN replies).",1324275200
3368687,comment,3367966,3368535,1,0,richardw,,,"Google ads on the content network, only on sites that you add, and start off with foodie sites.<p>Problem with the search network is that you need to target people who match your offing closely and it's very hard to do that when you don't know if the user 1) has an iPhone, 2) cooks, and 3) wants help deciding what to cook. So a normal 1% clickthrough rate would likely end up much lower than that unless you hit on some awesome uncompetitive keywords that match exactly what your app does, for the right target market.<p>At least with the content network, you can target foodies, and maybe some pages mention iphones and recipes so you can target those accurately. Some work involved, but that's how I'd do it.<p>Other thoughts:<p>You're calling it Random Chef. That doesn't reaaally solve the problem of the user. A casual scanner might think 'throw in random ingredients' or make some similar non-connection to what the app does. Their problem (or solution) isn't 'randomness', it's deciding what to make. So maybe 'menu decision maker' or 'recipe suggestion box' or 'chef's recipe suggestions' or something that a person who is reading a list of app names says 'that's exactly what I need!' because it hints at solving the problem they have.<p>Another thought: maybe the 'benefit' isn't the decision making, it's the more interesting menu. I know people who will order the same things from the store each week just so they don't have to think about it. That'll get boring after a while, so your app helps to make it less boring. Maybe add a checkbox for 'standard' recipes, and those make up the bulk of the recipes each week so everybody is happy, and throw in a new one once/twice a week just to grow the collection without making them think through each meal every day.<p>In any case, your idea of 1-month apps is a great one.

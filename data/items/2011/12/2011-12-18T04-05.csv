Haskell already has support for singly-infinite lists, so you can implement it very easily:<p><pre><code>    data Command s v = Halt | GoLeft s v | GoRight s v
    type Tape v = ([v], [v]) -- Both lists must be infinite.
    type Next s v = s -> v -> Command s v

    turing :: Next s v -> s -> Tape v -> Tape v
    turing f s t@(l:ls, r:rs) =
        case f s r of
        GoLeft s' v  -> turing f s' (ls, l:v:rs)
        GoRight s' v -> turing f s' (v:l:ls, rs)
        Halt         -> t
</code></pre>
If your Turing machine simulator is much more verbose than this, you are probably doing it wrong.<p>As an example, here's a Turing machine that counts the parity of the rightward run of 1s from the tape head's starting position, writes it to the tape, and halts:<p><pre><code>    data Bit = Zero | One deriving Show
    data ParityState = Even | Odd | Done

    parityTM = turing next Even
        where next Even     One  = GoRight Odd Zero
              next Odd      One  = GoRight Even Zero
              next Even     Zero = GoRight Done Zero
              next Odd      Zero = GoRight Done One
              next Done     _    = Halt
</code></pre>
To test it, here's a helper function that converts a Haskell integer into a tape containing all 0s to the left, a run of n 1s to the right, followed by all 0s, and runs the Turing machine on it:<p><pre><code>    parity :: Int -> Bit
    parity n = head $ fst $ parityTM (repeat Zero, replicate n One ++ repeat Zero)</code></pre>",1324183740

3365953,comment,3365433,3365927,3,0,Natsu,,,"> Why are you suddenly focusing on happiness of customers?<p>Because that's how you get people to give you money.  It should be common sense, but I see people failing badly.<p>Louis CK is a good example because he showed that caring more about fans than pirates is good business sense.  Pirates are going to pirate, so he said screw them, I'll do right by my fans.  See, you get $0 whether they pirate or don't pirate.  But with fans?  You get a sale if they buy and no sale if they don't.  So the pirates are all zeroes anyway, while the fans are the difference between sale and no sale, and that is what makes or breaks your business.<p>> I thought the debate was about legality, or, if not that, at least about moral right to download music.<p>As far as business goes, that debate is irrelevant.  And unless you enjoy the whole starving artist thing, business is kind of important.  Pirates haven't gone anywhere, so screwing your fans in the name of fighting piracy is cutting off your nose to spite your face.  But you don't have to listen to me.  You can tell your fans that it's your way or the highway if you want to.  Just don't complain when they take the highway instead and go off to buy from someone who treats them well, like Louis CK.",1324183656

There was a time when people did not believe in free speech. Free speech is an ideology. A widespread ideology, but one nonetheless. You need to consider very seriously whether your right to ""free speech"" of posting another person's work and creation is more important than an artist's right to their own work. Is it? Can you seriously tell yourself in ""net benefit to society"" that your ability to distribute stolen content is more important than the security an artist might need to create that content in the first place? And yes, some may produce anyway, even without that right to their own work, but beyond the speculation as to the cultural benevolence of man, can you really say that your ""right to distribute"" is more important than their right to simply have real ownership over that which they may have work on for months before they created a music product?

The value that the Haskell Platform has is that it includes the stuff that depends on system libraries (X11) and other packages that are more difficult than average to install.  That means that once you get the Platform, everything else will probably be easy to install, and so there's no point in including it.<p>(This is especially true of things like web frameworks; what's popular today may not be in 5 years, and deprecation cycles are hard.

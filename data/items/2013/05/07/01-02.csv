These are <i>militant</i> left wingers (the photos of the event seem to suggest this, based on my experiences in the neighborhood). I would not be surprised if there were more than a few violent folks in the crowd.<p>Keep in mind what happened the <i>last</i> time there was an anti-gentrification protest in the Mission. Ostensibly it's a peaceful gathering to march against gentrification. It turned into smashing windows of local independent businesses and massive vandalism.<p>Every leftist protest or demonstration in San Francisco seems to have a bad habit of turning violent. This isn't to say that everyone there is violent, or that their cause isn't worthwhile, but rather that if you see these marches or protests, the Black Bloc is always close at hand, so I'd watch right the fuck out.<p>> <i>""I would be very surprised if the people involved in an open air drug den had much to do with the people attending and organizing this protest.""</i><p>There's not much of an intersection. The whole open-air drug den thing isn't to associate the protesters with the crackheads of the neighborhood, but rather to say that this isn't like any street corner in San Francisco. This is a street corner that the police effectively have no control over. If you get jumped by a Black Bloc asshole with a bone to pick with Googlers, you are fending for yourself. Though, reading the article, it looks like the cops <i>were</i> on hand for this one, which is a nice change for the corner of 16th and Mission.<p>All in all, don't be so cavalier with your own safety. While San Francisco isn't ruled by the Khmer Rouge, the Mission is <i>not</i> a safe neighborhood. Don't let the bistros and boutique coffee shops fool you. If you mind your own business you'll be fine. If you go looking for trouble, the Mission has no problem delivering trouble to your face, fast.",1367891312

Obviously online storage/sharing features require network access to function, but otherwise all features are available without network access.<p>> Downloading the binaries that are installed locally is not zero-cost/zero-time; anyone whose primary access is, say, 3G is going to waste the better part of a month's allotment on installation and upgrades.<p>I agree they should have a physical purchase option for people without appropriate internet access (Apple had to do the same thing with their last update that was download only at first). Updates would be the same in either case, no matter what version you have currently you don't get mailed DVDs containing new camera profiles when they are released...<p>> And >180 days disconnected (or only having hyper-expensive satellite access) is not as far-fetched as you might think; many of the fine-art landscape photographers I know pretty much make their livings on that kind of a schedule.<p>I completely agree and apparently Adobe is willing to work with you if you are off network for long periods of time (by calling customer service). It seems like a pain, but this is the future of software so if this is your work schedule you should prepare for lots of headaches.<p>The pricing seems off to me for a suite where most people only use a few of the apps (personally a 2-app package would be ideal, I could care less about 90% of Adobe's apps).

The renter already has the right to deprive the owner of the property value increase, this is just creating a legal framework to give it back for cash. I'm imagining it would only be part of the value of increase in rent over the rent-control limit, not all of it.<p>It would increase market price rents modestly, as you're essentially depriving landlords of the power to shake off bad tenants by finding rent control loopholes or waiting them out, but you could offset that by creating a process for voluntary tenant buyouts.<p>Buyouts are currently very difficult to carry out legally even if the tenant wants to leave and the landlord would rather replace them with someone paying more, leaving the two parties stuck together in an unhappy marriage as an unintended side effect of the way the laws work.<p>In response to your edit: Of course you'd pay for them, new rentals are market-priced (then locked into rent control until that tenant leaves), aren't they? It's got one-sided risk like any option but those aren't hard to price. It's in everyone's interest to increase the future value of the rental unit.",1367891263

Most of these can be nicely pigeonholed as 'State', 'County', or 'Municipal'. Some can not.<p>* There are a handful of cities with multiple municipal tax rates. Most of these straddle counties. A small handful of them, perplexingly, don't.<p>* Most states charge tax based on the three(ish!) rates applicable at the sale's destination. Several charge based on the origin.<p>* Some states charge tax on shipping. Some states charge tax on shipping and handling. Some both, some neither.<p>* Three states only charge county and municipal level taxes if the destination is located in a county that the business has a phyiscal presence in. Of these three, one does something subtly different still.<p>* Figure the 5-digit zip code is sufficient to identify the applicable rates at a given address? Nope. You actually need to geolocate the street address to get it right sometimes.<p>* There are a nearly-unfathomable depth and breadth of exceptions on a type-of-goods basis (selling clothing in New York? It's exempt if it's under $110, but only from State tax, and additionally county tax if the destination is in one of 14 specific counties, unless it's in the cities of Norwich or Oneida, in which case the County tax applies again.)<p>This astounds me as a Software Developer and a Canadian (we have vastly simpler Sales Taxes). How they expect Joe Merchant to be able to charge all these taxes correctly without radical simplification (and unification) of tax codes is beyond me. Very far beyond me.<p>--EDIT--<p>After reading the full bill, it's not as bad as I previously thought (logistically, ignoring the more-taxes discussion). However, it is still pretty bad.<p>Salient points:<p>* One central authority per state means at most ~50 points of contact. This is better than 23,000, but not exactly good.<p>* Doesn't apply to merchants doing less than $1M/yr in business.<p>* States are required to provide a database of rates and boundaries. As worded in the bill, it's unclear whether this means zipcodes or bounding coordinates. Geolocation is not a cheap service at scale.<p>* Each state is required to provide software to calculate rates for a given sale. Given government, this will likely be a desktop Windows app that does not integrate cleanly with any server-side infrastructure, nevermind the fact that there will be 50 likely-distinct pieces of software.<p>On the other hand, with states actually being encouraged to publish their rates in a freely-available machine-friendly format for once, perhaps we'll see some startups pop up around this problem to ease the pain.",1367890859

But it would be strange indeed to say that you cant do exercise.  You may not want to do it.  You may be unwilling to invest the time and effort into doing it.  But you arent incapable of doing it.  And the same is true, in my experience, in mathematics.</i><p>I think a more apt comparison might be to sports, rather than to exercise. Everyone can get reasonably good at ""exercise"" i.e. be able to run a mile in a reasonable time, but I think we can all agree that there are certainly many people who simply ""can't do"" a sport.<p>For example, I am pretty bad at baseball. I was a terrible batter and an even worse fielder. I ""persevered"" and played Little League Baseball for several years, eventually realized I didn't have much if any aptitude for it, and stopped playing altogether. Does this mean I'm lazy or that the Little League coaching system is broken? No, it just means I'm not that good at baseball and probably never will be, and I don't think any amount of great coaching would have changed that.<p>Are there some people who could have been good at a given sport but ""slip through the cracks"" due to laziness or bad teaching? Maybe, but I doubt it's a significant number.<p>It's easy to take mathematics ability for granted on a focused forum like HN, but perhaps being good at math is no different from being a great sports athlete - Some people are really good at it, but most aren't and it's pretty unrealistic to expect everyone to change their expectations and opinions on the matter.",1367890756

It might be long, but you need to spend a longer time if you are confused.<p>First of all, P=NP is not a ""theory""; it's a _question_. We do not know whether the answer is ""yes"" or ""no""; most experts suspect that the answer is ""no"", i.e. P is not NP. There were attempts to prove it both ways, none successful or even remotely close. The theory encompassing the question is called computational complexity. It is a relatively new field (foundation is often taken to be ~1965), and many questions are open. However, we do make progress and each year there are breakthroughs. People hope to solve it some day - history shows that many open problems in mathematics resisted for long, but they were finally solved after centuries of thinking.<p>""I want it in simple words so it is easy to understand""<p>The definition of P and NP uses things such as ""decision problem"", ""polynomial running time"", ""nondeterministic"" algorithm or Turing machine etc. You need effort to understand them.

Writes solid code with good tests and, usually, high-quality documentation.<p>Corporate Engineer: bike-sheds the hell out of technical choices (war of attrition, and managerial favor helps) so he controls the stack and becomes the ""blazer"" while the other N-1 spend most of their time keeping up with his changes and look like underperformers. Calls himself an ""architect"".<p>True Programmer: writes excellent code to solve problems. Enjoys writing code, perhaps a little bit too much. Constantly learning new languages and technologies. Cares more about the technical challenge than the macroscopics of the problem (unlike the developer, whose stance is the reverse).<p>Corporate Programmer: drags windows and highlights stuff on his IDE. Moves the mouse around in circles for 8 hours per day, then goes home at 5:01. Occasionally plays with the menus and something ""magical"" happens, like the auto-generation of 18 Perforce clients due to some bizarre interaction of IDE plugins.<p>OP sounds terrible at interviewing and is probably really bad at Corporate, too.<p>He could get good at interviewing with a month of practice.

Rent control is the most tenant-hostile policy ever invented. It basically means that newcomers (or people who had to move) are subsidizing ridiculous rents of those who haven't moved in a while. Rent control restricts the freedom of movement.<p>My barber pays $1600 for a 2br apartment two blocks from the my building where a shitty 1br got rented within an hour after showing up on craigslist. The very same 1br was $2,400 just a year ago, and $2,200 two years ago.",1367888494
5665862,comment,5665537,5665537,2,0,lacker,,,"To understand the P = NP stuff, you first need to understand what people mean by ""P"" and ""NP"".<p>""P"" refers to problems that can be solved in polynomial time. This includes almost all of the normal algorithms that you use in everyday programming, like sorting a list or using a hash table.<p>""NP"" refers to problems whose answers can be checked in polynomial time. This is kind of a weird group of problems. Generally an NP problem will be phrased as, ""Can you find a solution to this formula?"" Like, can you color a given graph using X colors without giving two adjacent nodes the same color?<p>So. The ""P = NP"" question is whether these classes of problem are actually the same. You can generally solve a find-the-solution-to-this-formula problem by checking all the possible solutions. That takes exponential time, though. The ""P = NP?"" question asks, is there a general way of solving these problems faster?<p>Most people who have an opinion suspect that the answer is no. That P is not NP, and that there is no fast way to solve general formulas. However, it's really hard to prove that writing a particular program is impossible, and nobody has proven that P != NP.<p>It's a fairly complicated problem definition, so I wouldn't assume that all these folks are BSing you. It's just tricky to explain because it depends on a lot of other knowledge.",1367888489

There's easily space for that kind of journalism to exist in conjunction with the raw data of individual conversations that take place to generate that narrative. In the same way that data journalism takes data available to anyone and makes it palatable I would expect the same could easily be done in this case if the journalist felt the story was engaging enough.",1367888447

I'm 15 years into my IT career and I can honestly say it's not getting easier.  I don't believe it's an ageism thing, but just a symtom of something I still cannot put my finger on.<p>I put myself on sabbatical after realizing that my needs were not being met on a regular basis by my job.  While I'll allow short-term ROI to be negative, I will never allow my long-term ROI to be negative [3].  I took some time out of my life to spend it with my wife and young daughter, something which I'd never done in my life.  It is a blessing.<p>However, in the first week of my sabbatical I get called up for an interview with Expedia for a senior Web dev position.  I thought ""hey, I've never worked in the USA before, this could be fun"".  My interviewer was a junior dev who, in the course of the interview, demonstrated that he had very little experience in interviewing (whereas I have conducted > 100 interviews).  In the technical phone interview I was asked some esoteric questions about finding the intersection of two integer arrays, what the O-notation would be, and so forth.  I came up with some half-assed answers, since it had been years since I thought of those things [1] and since I was tired (on sabbatical) and didn't care if I got the job I asked the interview plainly how often this type of problem comes up in his work routine.  His answer: never.  Not once.  I mentioned to him that I don't understand asking these types of questions, and I have never asked something like that in an interview before.  I thanked him for his time, and prompted removed my resume from the application process [2].<p>To wit, my phone interviewing tactics for a Web dev position contain the following questions:<p><pre><code>    - when I type in a URL in my browser's address bar, press Enter, and then the page appears, tell me what happened technically in as low level as possible.\n    - what are the main verbs used in the HTTP protocol.\n    - something about CSS, JS, <backend language>, HTML\n    - something about how to handle a situation like breakfix, sensitive data leakage, etc.\n</code></pre>\nOnly after answering all of the questions in the phone interview properly, only then will I invite them in for an in-person interview.  However, even an in-person interview doesn't contain stupid programming puzzles or tricks...merely practical examples of things that have happened on the job.<p>[1] In other words, I think of O-notation in the back of my head when I code (loops within loops, etc), but I don't lead with it.<p>[2] Oh my, they did not like this.  Granted, I was working through their internal recruiting agency, but you'd think I just called their child ugly or something.<p>[3] That's my corporate-speak coming out.  Basically, short-term negative ROI is akin to working really hard and losing a bit of sleep to see a project to completion.  Long-term negative ROI is when the hard-work you are doing is not noticed by upper manager and you are passed over for awards, congratulations, and other extrinsic things.<p>Edit: clarity",1367888408

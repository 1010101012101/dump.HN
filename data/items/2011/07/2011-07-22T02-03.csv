Generally, developers should write applications to allow the same code run in as many different configurations as possible.  Using the compatibility library should help developers create applications that are designed to scale from low-end phones to high-end tablets.<p>If anything, I believe that the biggest boon is not so much in creating device-specific builds, but being able to leave out some things that are unnecessary to keep application sizes low.  If you know that a particular package is going to be used only on small, low-resolutions screens, there is no need to include the artwork for tablets.",1311301725

I believe MIT makes the newer version of the text available online, and the old MIT Open Courseware lectures that go along with the old version are <i>very</i> good. Also, the book ""The Little Schemer"" is a great way to get a handle on recursive thinking. Scheme is also very similar to the low level abstract syntax tree format of some kinds of compilers, so if you are interested in compiler theory it may be useful to know.<p>Erlang can be sort of considered a ""Scheme with syntax"". However, it is also somewhat weird, and if you're just starting with a functional language, you might as well go for Scheme.<p>I personally don't know that I'd recommend Haskell as a starting functional language. If you want to learn Haskell, I might suggest stating with Erlang as a baby untyped Haskell, and then move up to Haskell.<p>Also, Javascript is more functional than is generally realized, however, it's functional flavor may be more obvious after you have been exposed to an explicitly functional language.<p>One last thought, if you are interested in Web programming, Clojure is a functional flavored version of Lisp that runs on the JVM, and has a web framework called Compojure that seems well regarded.",1311301349

Many educators force students to submit their papres to Turnitin or else take a failing grade on the assignment (which is often a final project which can cause you to fail the course).<p>1. Turnitin cites fair use (""it's educational""), but one of the metrics of fair use is the extent of use (they use the whole thing), if it's used for profit (they are), and the affect of merchantability. As shady as it sounds, paper mills are not illegal, copyright infringement is. If a paper mill rejects your paper because it's been through turnitin, that hurts me as an author.<p>2. Another aspect of the monetization that really grinds my gears is that every paper I am forced to submit benefits turnitin by making their database larger and thus helping grant them a monopoly in this market. I am being forced to write articles for the monetary benefit of a company. If they're making money off my paper I want a cut.<p>3. Turnitin does not offer any way to remove one's documents from their database. If it was merely being used temporarily to compare for plagiarism against internet or book sources then that'd be reasonable. But they keep my papers forever and will continue to monetize them for years after the fact.<p>I understand the plight of educators that want to stop plagiarism, but forcing me to irrevocably offer royalty-free licenses for my work to a for-profit company that is then charging the school (which if it is public is being funded by my tax dollars) is just insane any way you slice it.<p>Unfortunately the courts sided with Turnitin on this issue back in 2007 and 2009 and somehow ruled that their for-profit use was fair use.",1311300748

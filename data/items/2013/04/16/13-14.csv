5558064,comment,5557171,5558018,4,0,vonmoltke,,,"> The problem is that most companies make it a lot harder to move internally than they advertise. They have ridiculous ""headcount"" issues and it's almost impossible to move in most firms without a top-20% performance record... but impossible to get a top-20% review unless your manager sees you as having staying power. So you have to play dishonest political games, in most companies, to get the one big-company benefit (lateral mobility) that actually matters.<p>>In fact, most companies are so fucked up on the matter of internal mobility that the only genuine time at which transfer's possible is shortly after a promotion, but managers rarely promote people who seem to have any interest in mobility.<p>This was the driving reason I left my prior employer.  I had no internal mobility without some sort of advocate, despite the large number of open reqs.  At the end I got hit by the political double whammy of not having any support for a lateral transfer from my manager[1] and being on the 800lb gorilla project that was trying to draw people in from elsewhere at the time I was trying to leave.  The company got away with shit like this, though, because most people thought that was just the way it was at large companies, and small companies were too risky and flaky.<p>[1] I even got labelled ""disloyal"" in the heat of the moment for expressing the desire once.",1366120782

5558055,comment,5557647,5557647,7,0,andreasklinger,,,"Many people i talk make the same mistake with lean and custdev.<p>And i have to say i did the same mistake.<p>We try to things the lean way and hope therefore we do it the right way. Eg. building an MVP that should validate our business assumptions.<p>All of the methods around lean and custdev sound perfect in theory. But validating that you do the right thing (apart of a super obvious strong market pull) is extremely hard.<p>A common mistake i see is when people speak about 20 different hypotheses or experiments - and usually none of them is related to a real make-or-break risk of their company.<p>They try to validate that they do the right thing. Which is extremely hard.<p>As entrepreneurs <i>we</i> are in charge of a strong product/customer vision. Any method we use is only in charge to check if we are lying to ourselves.<p>But many of the techniques used in custdev/lean are very strong tools for minimizing the downside.<p>And this is (imho) where we should use them.<p>Our main goal is not upside optimisation (waiting for the go) but downside minimization (avoiding the no-go)<p>Or differently put: They are very good to double check if you aren't doing the wrong thing, if we aren't lying to ourselves.<p>The other main mistake i see is ""trying to do it the lean way"":<p>There is no ""lean"" way. Lean is a reverse engineered model largely based on survivor bias and wrong self-reflection. But that's completely ok. We must not forget how young fast-growth oriented product-centric entrepreneurship is. Even custdev which is more fullstack than lean is mostly academic and best used only as a frame of thought. Not as a blueprint model. Lean will be replaced by other models using the same or improved stack elements.<p>Just like me, too many people are obsessed with the theory behind lean and see it as fullstack solution.<p>Instead of looking at lean as a fullstack, we should pick parts of that stack that make sense for our business - as we do eg in software engineering or ux.<p>E.g. MVPs tend to be a problem with b2B relationships. Agency like concierge code-for-hire models tend to work better. Also customer interviews work gold for B2B - by far better than for b2c models.<p>Simply put: We need to pick stack elements of lean and custdev as we would pick elements of software stacks, depending on our business's risks and challenges.<p>If you are interested what i mean with stack elements, take a look at \n- customer interviews <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/actionable-customer-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/actionable-customer...</a>\n- metrics in early stage <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/metrics-for-early-stage-startups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/metrics-for-early-s...</a>\n- jobs to be done <a href=""http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html</a>\n- and several other aspects: <a href=""http://www.hackertalks.io/robfitz/why-bother-talking-to-customers-and-how-to-not-waste-your-time-doing-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackertalks.io/robfitz/why-bother-talking-to-cust...</a>",1366120643

Prosecuting the criminals who commit murder for the purpose of terrorism is clearly a ""no reasonable person could disagree"" sort of a thing.<p>But the question remains, how is justice won? In theory we could impose martial law and suspend elections, or permanently shut all the roads and trains and prohibit gatherings of more than five people in the same place, or nuke the entire middle east. Perhaps doing those things could bring justice to more terrorists.<p>Well before we reach that point, we come to a line we should not cross. We come to a choice that will cost us more of our humanity than it gains us in justice.

They do sell audiobooks, but I mostly listen to free libravox books, its far better than the libravox apps.

It would be kinda interesting to get notifications everytime I (or someone else) does something with my account, or be able to see my balance if I'm paying at a store. (whoops edited to add the killer problem is the Goog TOS require full access to all features for all free downloaders, but I just realized my credit union only provides service to people in a limited geographic area by charter... so they'd have to give free houses in their area to anyone downloading the free app so they get full access to the system by opening an account, this is a killer problem which moves this and any other app like it to the dead zone)<p>What I could do:<p>I think the newsblur client works with a free account so although I have a paid account I think I'm OK.<p>Same deal as above with the dropbox client.<p>Baconreader, I guess thats OK.

A number of people left for telecoms large and small during that period, then got burned on the bubble pop and came back humbled.

Big or small doesn't matter <i>that</i> much because all people (under the right conditions) have parasitic tendencies and power makes it worse. Good companies are easily less than 10 percent, and startups are no better.<p>What makes startups seem great is the survivor bias. The shitty ones with MBA-style management and closed allocation tend to faceplant. The good ones grow and become less good gradually.<p>Also, many of the big-company perks mentioned in the OP don't exist.<p>Big companies actually don't provide better benefits than startups. Banks, for just one example, have pretty shitty health insurance due to misguided shareholder activism and cost-cutting. Also, it takes <i>forever</i> to move up in large companies. The upshot of that, though, is that you'll never have a 25-year-old manager-favorite ladyboy hipster douche barking orders at you (which I have seen demolish a startup or two).<p>Finally, large companies are not great at long-term projects. Those tend to be cut first when there are cuts, and in most companies, continuous cutting is now in favor over press-making layoffs. The best people in large companies (excluding companies with a real research presence, and those aren't paying salaries that would impress anyone on HN) want to work on immediate P&L stuff, not long-term efforts that lack job security and short-term promotability.<p>There is exactly one reason to work for big companies, and it can be substantial: <i>lateral mobility</i>. Your compensation won't go up fast, but if you can move to more interesting work under a manager the ability to protect, it can be a pretty damn good deal, because with a good manager it doesn't matter that you're in a mediocre company. You'll get to learn a lot (even if you won't have a major impact) and your work will be interesting enough (much more interesting than what most of these startups do) to provide jumping off points into credible side projects and, possibly, startups. It can be a great way to get a 5-year stint (there are plenty of HR Boomer-o-saurs who are still stuck up about ""job hoppers"") and a lot of time to learn.<p>The problem is that most companies make it a lot harder to move internally than they advertise. They have ridiculous ""headcount"" issues and it's almost impossible to move in most firms without a top-20% performance record... but impossible to <i>get</i> a top-20% review unless your manager sees you as having staying power.

Hence why people _nominally_ talking about that subject may, in fact, be talking about different things.<p>> Nearly every venue has either enacted or is enacting policies and procedures to either prevent it or severely penalize it, because that is what all of their customers want.<p>Regarding penalties to prevent or penalize it, I disagree.  NASDAQ's policy uses a ratio weighted by distance from the top-of-book.  There is no penalty for excessive order submit-cancel loops at the top-of-book.  Their matching engine also operates in a fashion which specifically encourages cancel/resubmit loops at the top-of-book, in that they accept and subsequently display limit orders at a different price than submitted.  If they were serious about preventing quote-stuffing, they could fix this simply by rejecting those orders.  Presumably they either don't care (because their system doesn't get bogged down), or there is pressure from some big customers to keep the status quo here.",1366120226

Not since eBay removed the ability to leave negative feedback for buyers, anyways.<p>If I were the seller in this case, rather than going to court, and negative feedback was still around, I'd have left them the same with something like ""PITA buyer, - feedback for being off $1 in shipping.

Remember you have done this thing many times over the years. So <i>now</i> it seems trivial to you but probably not to your student who has never done it before. So be patient and go slow.<p>- Everyone learns differently. Figure out what works for <i>that</i> specific student and use it to your advantage. If you user is a writer who wants to learn how to program, try and use some references to writing if you can when explaining a concept.<p>- Focus on the negative cases. Teach a specific concept (say pointers in C or vector in Java) not just by showing an example program that works. Teach it by breaking the program and showing how the compiler/interpreter etc. behaves when something does not work the right way.<p>- Try and use pictures/diagrams to illustrate a concept if necessary. For example, pointers can really be explained well if described in pictures where you show the address, the value etc. and how they are related. For example, when you say int * p, what really happens.<p>- Teach them how to ""design"" a program for larger programs. For example, I was taught to use nouns and verbs where nouns <i>usually</i> become class. Something like that. But knowing how to design an app is very important in my opinion.",1366118683

It's either the customer, the payment processor, or the merchant, or possibly two of them, but it certainly isn't no-one.<p>There were multiple periods <i>today</i> in which Bitcoin fell more than 10% in 15 minutes.

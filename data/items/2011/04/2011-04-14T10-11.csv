2446349,comment,2438980,2444935,1,0,danssig,,,">please avoid any sentence of the form ""So what you're saying is....""<p>No, the point of that statement was to break down what you were saying for you because you might not have been aware (and still aren't apparently).  The OP was saying <i>the people posting here on HN</i> were whinny people with an entitled mentality.  So no, what I said was in no way a misrepresentation.  Then you came on defending what he said without pointing out that you disagreed with his application of his theory <i>to HN posters</i> (you still haven't).<p>So you point out some mythical situation where you think someone would be behaving irrational.  What does that have to do with this thread?  No one has claimed to be mad about the money for the money's sake so this whole line is a straw man.  Unless you (like the OP) <i>are</i> claiming other people here are behaving this way.<p>>et's say that I am making $50,000 and I am perfectly happy with it. More money would be nice, but I do not consider that more money to be at all essential to my happiness. Suddenly I find out my coworker is making $60,000, or even $100,000. It is irrational for me to now be unhappy with the same $50,000 I was happy about thirty seconds ago.<p>Again this is wrong.  The mythical person was happy because he/she assumed the market rate for what they did was $50k.  Now they've just seen evidence that it's actually $100k. The rational response is to take action as they're potentially leaving $50k (or more) of your value on the table.  The person's happiness was based on a lie or misunderstanding and the new unhappiness is based on finding out the truth.<p>You're only going to live so long and you only have so much earning potential.  Leaving money on the table for no other reason than some feeling of happiness is the furthest thing from rational.",1302778646

multi means 2, then said it did not work

How about changing it into something that has an output for which I own copyright / redistribution rights, such that I can sell it?<p>If the output of a program can be considered derived work of that program, than freedom (0) is bitch-slapped.

2446284,comment,2444590,2446025,2,0,qrybam,,,"Interesting article. I'm not much of a console gamer (not much of a gamer anymore in general) but those figures are horrifying for a PC gamer to look at! 100-150ms lag (not counting any network lag on-top) would be pretty hard to swallow for me, but I'm biased and have a bit of a purest view on these things. I guess the most important thing is that you have fun - in which case, if the game achieves this but lags a bit, who cares?",1302776293

2446280,comment,2444590,2444854,4,0,qrybam,,,"Depends on the monitor. You're pretty much stuck when it comes to most current TVs and LCD/LED displays as well (60Hz, 70Hz, 75Hz sometimes 100Hz).<p>Before flat screens were affordable we were all using CRTs. A good CRT could push a 150Hz refresh rate. When Quake3 was still being played competitively (it /kind/ of still is with QuakeLive, but it's not the same anymore imo) we ran the game at a capped 120 FPS, set the monitor refresh to 120Hz and then turned on V-sync which equated to the smoothest and most responsive experience I've ever had in a game - it's pretty much indescribable and most people would argue that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference anyway, but even though solid 60 FPS on a v-synced 60Hz screen in most modern games comes pretty close, you can definitely feel the difference.<p>The worst is when you have some FPS lag with v-sync enabled - then it's a lot more noticeable than without v-sync.<p>I remember that during Quake4's (the 60FPS cap was hardcoded in Quake4, and somehow part of the engine, which in theory at least, made 120FPS/120Hz redundent) short run on the comeptitive scene, players complained that they wanted the cap lifted from 60FPS to 120FPS (or just any configurable number) so they could play on 120Hz monitors. id finally caved and released a patch which allowed this, and this made a huge difference. It definitely gave you an edge over the 60/60 players.",1302776015

2446261,comment,2445715,2445980,2,0,lsc,,,">But even preferred shares are a terrible idea. The right thing is to give the founder a convertible note. That means the founder has debt if the company folds early (and gets his/her money back), and if the company raises a financing round, they just convert on those terms in to the same preferred shares as the subsequent investors.<p>This seems like an elegant solution to the problem. So these convertible notes pay interest, right?  is this generally fairly high interest?  I mean, if I were to ask a bank for a loan without a personal co-sign,[1] they would charge me a pretty hefty rate if they looked at me at all.<p>At least for my company, even upon success the chance of an investment round is... small, so I imagine the people buying those convertible notes would still want some upside.<p>[1] I'm assuming these convertible notes are corporate debt, not personal debt backed by the founders",1302775481

A numeric value can only express a limited classification.

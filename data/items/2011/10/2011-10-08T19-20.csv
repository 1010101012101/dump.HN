If you look at Eq 1 in the arxiv paper, you will see that they start by calculating the Seebeck coefficient from first principles.  (My original comment above turns out to be exactly the issue.)<p>The reason that this is interesting:  The authors are saying that there is an interesting Seebeck effect as a consequence of graphene's material properties, especially its odd density of states.<p>To the point you raised:  The electron population does absorb photons.  But rather than transporting across the pn junction due to the increased energy of the absorbed photon, it collides with other electrons and then these electrons form a population with an elevated temperature among themselves.  The electrons do not couple with the lattice, so they don't transfer energy to the lattice all that quickly.  Hot electrons from the high-temperature ensemble then have a probability of making it across the pn junction.<p>Like I said above, I haven't fully digested the paper (and I doubt I will, it's not in my critical path), but that was my quick take.

3088719,comment,3088284,3088672,5,0,saurik,,,"I would love if someone from Stripe talked about how they handled this sort of stuff. Everyone keeps saying ""I use Stripe and love them"", but the process people describe of signing up seems to be begging people to scam them.<p>There are actually good reasons why merchant accounts work the way that they do, and Stripe doesn't provide any argument for why they don't: until they do, I can't imagine trusting them for anything important at my business.<p>I mean, they are almost sketchy when it comes to talking about ""when bad things happen""; example: when chargebacks happen (and they do happen: I get one every couple days), can I easily (as in: no human interaction) tie it to an individual payment? The only mentions on their entire website about chargebacks are in the painfully informal FAQ/pricing (that it costs $15), and in their terms of service (which indicates that the $15 doesn't include mediation, which I'm pretty certain PayPal's $20 does).<p>The first thing I think, of course, is ""they charge more, duh"": if you do any kind of volume at all, or are involved in small transactions, they are a /lot/ more expensive than PayPal: I'd easily be paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for the privilege of not spending a few hours on the phone negotiating a merchant account.<p>(For those not looking at their pricing, their fixed fee is PayPal's worst case fee; PayPal discounts 1-2% from that for volume, and supports a fundamentally better fee schedule for payments under $12: 5.0%+$0.05 vs. 2.9%+$0.30. Unless you are handling small numbers of transactions all over $12, Stripe is going to burn you on fees.)<p>However, when I think through ""where does the risk of credit fraud mostly occur"", I'd imagine it would be reasonable sized transactions (trying to launder tons of money $1 at a time will get noticed pretty quickly), and I'd imagine the merchant fraud is mostly small volume (as if you actually have a functional business, you are able to easily able to cover the risks).<p>So yeah: I just don't get it... is the Stripe 7 day hold enough? (PayPal doesn't have any hold for most businesses.) I certainly wouldn't touch it over PayPal if the only reason is ""PayPal seems overly cautious"": Stripe simply seems to be ""asking for it"".<p>(And this is just looking at normal chargebacks: pre-orders are a whole different ballgame, and if Stripe doesn't have a policy forbidding them then they will probably be out of business, seemingly out of nowhere, in a few months.)",1318102278

3088715,comment,3088342,3088573,3,0,cheald,,,">  Apple have vision while Android just slavishly copies them. Siri is a perfect example of this. They didn't make it but as soon as they saw it they knew it was what they wanted, where they wanted to take it.<p>This is sort of blowing my mind. After the release of the iPhone, Android shifted from a trackball-based design to a touch-based design (which <i>is</i> a big shift), and copied the Apple homescreen for its app drawer layout, but to call it a ""slavish copy"" is disingenuous. Android diverges - and innovates - in a lot of very significant ways. Google has been offering voice search/commands/voice-to-text for Android long before Siri. It did notifications and task switching far better than iOS did (and iOS has now ""slavishly"" copied those concepts). The back button and activity stack make the device usage behaviors ridiculously different from iOS usage. It's been doing wireless sync and cloud-based stuff for a long while; Apple's just now starting to integrate that stuff.<p>iOS has better-looking stock art assets/widgets, and the application approval process guarantees an adherence to Apple's UI design policies, which does help produce a more consistent experience for the things that Apple cares about, but to me personally, iOS feels like a toy next to Android. As non-fanboyishly as I can say it, I genuinely believe Android is better software than iOS. Apple has the vertical integration down better, no doubt, and their marketing is about a thousand times better than anything that any of the Android handset makers are doing, but I don't think you can use both OSes and seriously dismiss Android as a cheap carbon copy.",1318102170

For one, you already get a copyright on the software you write, as well as any books or pamphlets that your company might write to describe your business process.  So there really is no reason for the patent -- you can use your copyright for all types of business practices.<p>Second, the purpose of patents was to protect an inventor for a limited time to encourage invention.

My experience tells me that an API provider, especially a public one, is like a nasty virus. It has to consume more and more of the market, by whatever means necessary, to generate more revenue to satisfy it's stakeholders.<p>Google is a perfect example of that. It provides marketing services to FourSquare and other check-in services, but then it uses the data they generate using it's services to build and market it's own checkin service, while STILL taking their money for ads.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't hold anything against Google for using its market position as it does. It has spent the time and money to get where it is, and FourSquare has the right to use or not use Google services to market itself, and it had to accept Google's terms of usage in order to do so.<p>That said, Google doesn't build anything that has a dependency on singular external sources, as it expects its users to do with its APIs. If there is a single source, Google buys it or replicates the dataset using it's own means, then positions itself as the primary source for that data.<p>Take map data. Google didn't have any map data. It licensed and bought its way into the market, and now if you google ""maps"", Google comes up as the primary source, and there are ZERO ads for that keyword.  It used to be that when you typed ""maps"" into Google search, you'd see ads for Rand/McNally and other map service providers.<p>Now, they're all gone and only the big online map data providers are atop the natural results, and it's uncommon to see any ads.<p>Think you can SEO your way to the top of the list in maps? Good luck. It's not happening.<p>If you're currently in this position, you should be preparing for your business for imminent collapse. Alternatively, you could build or buy your own version of the dataset(s) and/or API(s) you use so that they have no outside dependencies.<p>If you're an investor, and you're approached by someone using external data sources as a platform for their business, DO NOT invest unless they have a solid plan to buy or build their own version of the dataset(s) or API(s). In fact, I'd suggest making any investment contingent on them doing so.<p>Just my $0.02 (adjusted for inflation).",1318100845

Usually the idea is that metering costs more than the bandwidth, up to a point, so you get a 'don't worry about it' quota, and then a punishing price after that.  Me, I limit people after the 'don't worry about it' price, because, well, the sort of people who are my customer don't want to get hit by unexpected bills.<p>what would that look like if you had the 'don't worry about it' quota with a more reasonable price on overages?

Meanwhile, the author never seems to talk about the parse time. Which, will be exponential. See <a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/</a> for all the glory details.<p>Specific points:<p>> Im talking about parsing XML, not checking whether some input actually is XML. Correctness is a Boolean, after all: invalid XML is not XML.<p>However, from a particularly pedantic point of view: To parse is to check whether the input is in your language. If your parser excepts input that is not XML it is not an XML parser. It is a parser which accepts some language which largely overlaps with XML, but is not XML.<p>I know it's an academic point, but it <i>is</i> an important one. When you have properly parsed your input, you should be sure that the input is what you were expecting. A parser that excepts a different language than the intended one can be highly misleading.<p>So I am left to wonder what is the point of it all. You never say in the article.<p><i>tl;dr</i><p>Read the dragon book. Learn what a Language actually is. Study some Chomsky. Write a recursive descent parser. Lay in the green green grass.

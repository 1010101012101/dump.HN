22238,comment,22062,22062,0,0,sabat,,,"IMHO, Java is not dead, but it's found its home: the enterprise.<p>Java has a ton of overhead in its syntax and structure: just saying ""Hello world"" takes like 10 lines.<p>In an enterprise, where you have so many developers who will work on the same codebase, then a nanny-language like Java is appropriate. You never know who might take advantage of a lack of structure and do something Really Stupid[tm] that you won't find out about until much later.<p>But for hacking? YMMV but in my experience, the only hackers who need Java are the ones who cannot exist without a lot of predefined structure.",1179240340

Isn't that <i>great news</i>? Shouldn't you be thrilled?<p>Let's not get ahead of ourselves: we can have a big party after the company you start to hire all these great undervalued programmers finishes up its IPO.",1179239041

22228,comment,21974,22213,0,0,sabat,,,"$200k/yr may seem massive, but here in the bay area, it's not. $150k is about the base if you don't want to live at the very edge (so far out that it's a 1.5 hour commute to get to San Mateo, SF, San Jose, etc.).<p>I live in a 1800 sq ft townhouse on the peninsula worth $900,000, I'm on one income, and my head is just above water -- I can save money every paycheck, but not as much as you think. I make just shy of $200k.<p>I know you realize that the bay area is expensive -- I'm just not sure you realize how expensive it is.<p>That fact doesn't change what investors do -- maybe they don't want to invest in salaries. But forcing entrepreneurs into huge debt doesn't sound like a smart investment plan. No one's looking for a mansion; I just don't want to live in the ghetto because I had an idea.",1179237820

Diaspora had substantial cash flow shortly after launching the foundation. In fact they got SO MUCH MONEY that PayPal froze their account, probably because they thought it was fraud (fraud detection is REALLY hard and false positives are cheaper than false negatives...this is IMHO the most likely interpretation).<p>On the contrary, Ilya was in a GREAT position.

I have trouble with this sort of thinking. It's a little too pat, a little too wishful, requires a little too much reliance on faith. Things are never that simple. You can't just find one screw and keep cranking on it indefinitely. Progress relies on the occasional blacksmith[1].<p>And this is good. It helps social mobility. I have a hard time imagining a metric that wouldn't entrench a tiny set of haves if it grew without bound. Monotonic progress perpetuates the status quo, like trees stunting the ground around themselves. To avoid it requires periodic creative destruction. Ends of eras. The saturating of metrics.<p>(If I could still edit my original comment I'd replace 'weird' with 'interesting/weird'.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg</a>",1321225177

As underwhelming as this is, I think it's incredibly generous, as I would call its social form simply ""nothing.""<p>The tendency to start artisan businesses is not a social <i>narrative</i>, it's just another part of the <i>aesthetic</i>.  The author compares modern youth culture with the hippies, beatniks, and punks.  But those generations were doing what they were doing <i>for a reason</i>.  Read anything from the heroes of those generations, and you'll see a clear ""grand narrative"" that described the social relationships of the world they were trying to create.  The social narrative of punk culture was not ""a tendency to start bands that played three chord songs.""  That was part of the social aesthetic.  The narrative was one of anti-authoritarinism, collective autonomy, and a vision for a world without hierarchy.<p>The truth is that youth culture today has no narrative.  Yes, money is cool again, small-business entrepreneurship is a common pursuit, and ""maker"" culture has taken root, but these are just the things people do.  Ask someone why they made the latest LED clock design out of ""make magazine,"" and they'll more than likely say something along the lines of ""because it's neat.""  Look at the average young entrepreneur, and you'll find someone who discovered technology before they discovered themselves -- someone who is ""innovating"" because that's what they read they're supposed to do, rather than out of some informed sense of the social reality they're trying to create.",1321224285

But the claim that successive releases of OS X become more user-hostile and encourages more lock-in is a bit of a stretch.<p>Apple has never developed for the power user, and they never should -- this is part of what makes their products so great; their unrelenting focus on the common case. In fact, complaining about a hidden library file for Mail.app misses this point entirely. It's actually a wonderful feature, since the common user is more likely to mess up their own mail library than to have a need to move it between disks.<p>+Tim O'Reilly's second point is valid, though, the UX for emptying the trash can definitely be improved. But again, is the common case deleting 400,000 files? Is the ""delete whatever you can checkbox"" too odd for a normal user to understand? Let's take the mom example; if your mom emptied the trash after deleting a file, would she want to know if it couldn't be emptied, or would she be OK with it being emptied without her recently deleted file actually being removed?<p>People can yell for a OS do-over all they want. The fact remains though: Apple focuses on UX more than any other company I know. If that UX doesn't cater to your particular needs and you'd rather have power-user flexibility and features, even if it means less polish and more annoyances when dealing with common tasks, use Linux or Windows.

What is it about certain commonly-censored materials that makes them so special?  Why can't a person just change the channel or read something else to avoid uncomfortable material?  Also, why are people so much more likely to be angry about swear words (which cause no demonstrable harm), when things that <i>do</i> cause harm (like wars) are more-or-less tolerated silently?  Makes you wonder.",1321221861

The custom and implicit if not explicit promise is that you do your time, work hard, and get paid. And that trumps the letter of the agreement. Go to a typical startup and ask the people working there if they know what all the language means. In my experience it is the rare exception that someone does. Usually, they are relying on ethical behavior from the founders, and will admit as much if you ask them.<p>If that language were written for this purpose, you would see people being forced out of their options prior to the one year cliff routinely.<p>But then, if that were common (or even somewhat likely), options would have literally near-zero value. See the problem? This <i>cannot</i> be the default behavior and make sense as an incentive. It <i>has</i> to be reserved for very rare and special circumstances. And even then, I have trouble thinking up a scenario where you would want to keep the employee but reduce their equity compensation.<p>Yes, these are agreements between consenting adults. But a contract is only a contract if minds meet. And if one mind is thinking ""if I work hard, I'll get paid whatever this stock is worth"" and the other is thinking ""I'll reduce this guy's payment later if I want to"", then you don't really have a meeting of the minds at all, do you? It doesn't matter what the words on the paper say.",1321221700

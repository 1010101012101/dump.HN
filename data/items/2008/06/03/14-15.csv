If you're developing {framework}, that's reasonable, but if it's just a tool being used correctly, it isn't your problem and you should talk more about what you want folks to do with {framework}.",1212505183

To whom? Surely not to people enjoying music - infringing copyright has made more people listen to more music.</i><p>It's harmful to the producers.  It's not cheap or easy to put together a professional music recording.

Noah had completed new textbooks for use in the public school system, which <i>he had based</i> on existing works.  Nevertheless, his books were new productions, and he wanted to have control over how they were copied; he wanted to be able to profit from the production of his works.  (Noah was never a very rich man, by the way; don't get the idea he was insanely wealthy and scavaging for more.)<p>Daniel Webster agreed wholeheartedly, that authors should have the right to how their works are copied and should get royalty payments <i>for a limited time</i>.  He claimed this was so obvious it was like ""natural law""...  as obvious as laws against murdering and theft.<p>Some people in recent history (e.g., the RIAA and other big corporations) have taken copyright law to absurd and abusive levels, and that is wrong.  But the basic principles of it -- to allow the author of a work rights over who copies it and rights to limited royalty payments -- are <i>not</i> absurd and <i>do</i> contribute to the furthering of more and better works.",1212503899

CLOS has multimethods and multiple inheritance; Java has explicit interfaces.<p>Frankly, multiple inheritance, and multimethods, are nice tools when you need them, but I'd say that most of the time, you don't.  (Let me clarify that.  Doing what Java does with multiple inheritance of interfaces IS very important, and it would be very bad to leave that out.  What Java cannot do, namely multiple inheritance of implementation, is much less crucial.  And you can very often get around it by using delegation.  See ""The Treaty of Orlando"" which asserts that multiple inheritance and delegation have the same inherent power.  (This was formulated at an OOPSLA conference in the 80's; Henry Lieberman was one of the main authors.)<p>Anyway, my point is that Java does indeed have limitations, but the fundamental concepts are very similar to those in CLOS.",1212503402

207906,comment,207486,207805,0,0,DanWeinreb,,,"Yes.  That's why you want a multi-paradigm language, in which all of those methods of writing code are available.  The trick is to figure out how to provide all of them in a way that is well-integrated.  I feel that Common Lisp does this very well.  For example, when you want a method to get called, you don't use a special ""send message"" operator; you use a generic function.  It looks just like a function call, to the caller; the fact that this call is doing a method dispatch is part of its internal implementation, rather than part of its externally-visible contract.<p>One reason Lisp has survived so long because it is capable of absorbing so many of the good new programming ideas as they come along.

You have to look over all the boilerplate and see if it's all exactly the usual boilerplate, or whether one or two methods in there were manually improved.  If the IDE has to generate it, it means that the programming language is expressing your wishes at too low a level of abstraction, rather than more-directly reflecting what you were trying to say in the first place.

Yes, you have to let the IDE handle it for you, which is fine for writing code but not so great for reading (someone else's, or even your own) code.<p>I will assert, though I can't demonstrate it, that had this been done in Lisp, the boilerplate problem could have been substantially alleviated by using Lisp macros.  One piece of evidence: J2EE has improved this problem substantially by using Java's relatively-new ""annotation"" feature, which, broadly speaking, has some of the same mojo as Lisp macros, when used properly.<p>On the other hand, you can do a lot better even in Java.

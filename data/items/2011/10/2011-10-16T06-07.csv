""Monsanto entered India in 2002 with some very compelling advertising. They claimed their engineered seeds would produce yields up to five times that of conventional cotton  20 quintals per acre (equivalent to approximately 4.5 bales) compared to the 4 quintals (less than 1 bale) farmers were struggling to pull from their fields at the time. At the time, Monsanto admitted that their seeds costed more but insisted that investment would pay dividends.<p>Unfortunately the average yield of Monsantos GE cotton turned out to be nowhere near the advertised 20 quintals per acre. In reality the average output of the crop turned out to be 1.2 quintals per acre. Nowhere in India did it exceed 4 quintals per acre at the end of the harvest. To add insult to injury, farmers soon found out that the fibers produced by the Monsanto GE cotton plants were of lower quality. Instead of getting the usual $86 per quintal, they were only able to sell their crops for around $36 per quintal.
On average since 2002, of the farmers in India, many of whom fell into the Monsanto trap, one is committing suicide every 30 minutes. Many end their lives by drinking RoundUp.""<p>The list goes on, if you've read this far and want more, I'll be glad to dig up some more of the material.",1318748362

I am almost hilariously nearsighted, and find it quite difficult to ensure that I'm walking out with a haircut I won't be disappointed with when I get home and get a chance to see it up close where my eyeballs work. As a result, I have to trust that my barber didn't do anything that will be a problem to fix later.<p>After a two consecutive bad haircuts where the barber apparently ignored the one thing I asked for and I had to fix it myself at home, I bit the bullet and bought myself a cheap pair of clippers. I'm married with a newborn baby, and am as close to ""off the market"" as a man in his 20's can be. Having a hairstyle straight out of a magazine picture is the least of my concerns right now. I now ask my wife to trim me up every weekend and I couldn't be happier. My hair looks the way I want it to, I save $15 a month, and I no longer have to wonder ""what corners did this scissor jockey cut to move on to the head after mine?""",1318745723

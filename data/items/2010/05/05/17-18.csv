1321922,comment,1321739,1321739,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Nice post overall, but his point about poker got me thinking about when I used to play:<p>> In poker, there are simple rules you can follow to put yourself ahead of 90% of other poker players. One of my favorite rules revolves around removing any attachment to the value of poker chips. When playing poker, the chips in front of you have absolutely no value, they’re just a medium for you to win chips from other poker players. Most players don’t play their A-game because they’re trying to “make the money” and don’t want to risk losing all their chips (which they end up losing anyways).<p>This is a good strategy to get from being a beginner to get a more skilled place. You should be playing stakes that you have the bankroll and emotion to be able to play reasonably aggressively, make correct plays, and afford to lose at. So, this is decent advice going from being a new player who is afraid of losing his money to thinking of the chips more abstractly and playing correctly.<p>However, play is considerably different at higher levels, and you should take and process information accordingly. I haven't followed poker so much recently, but when I was playing David Skalansky was generally considered to have written the definitive guides on playing well:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sklansky#Books"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sklansky#Books</a><p>Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players was one of the most incredible books I've ever read in my life, and though I don't play more than a couple times a year, I should probably re-read it at some point because it teaches you how to think.<p>I read Hold'em Advanced before Small Stakes came out. Reading Small Stakes was even more eye-opening - Skalansky came right out and said something like, ""You shouldn't be using advanced plays at lower levels, instead you should adjust to the quality of opponent.""<p>It was huge - I'd been trying to make elaborate, tricky plays in low stakes games and getting killed off of it. Small stakes talked a lot about managing your own psychology against bad players, and then just play hands that make strong hands, and bet for value a lot. Adjusting my play downwards let me absolutely destroy low stakes games after that.<p>I've never played incredibly high stakes, but at mid/high stakes you've got to think about folding to a 3-bet on the turn even with a decent hand sometimes. Small stakes you should only be betting if you want to be called, and then probably should call down after that. Calling down in a mid/high stakes game is going to brutalize you, but you should generally only be putting yourself in a position where you want to call down in a low stakes game.<p>Anyway, I agree with the general sentiment of the post, just wanted to riff on cards a little bit after reading that. The main point is abstracting the money considerations away is good for becoming an intermediately skilled player, but considering the stakes is valuable again at the higher levels of play.<p>And definitely check out Skalansky if you like cards, poker, game theory, or math at all, they're really marvelous books.",1273082117
1321921,comment,1319034,1320698,0,0,eru,,,"Depends on what you want to achieve.  If you leave out the dimension of static vs dynamic typing, you could get most of Haskell's benefits by making your Scheme pure, and confining side-effects.  (Monads are one solution for this, but not the only one.  Have a look at Functional reactive programming, or see how Clean uses linear typing.)  You could probably hack most of the pureness stuff together with macros in an already existing Scheme.<p>Purity by (strong) default makes it easier to combine your programs.  Lazyness can help, too, but I am not completely sure whether you should make lazy the default.  Chris Okasaki's ""Purely Functional Data Structures"" argues for needing both lazy and strict evaluation to guarantee asymptotic run times.<p>Have a look at, say, Software Transactional Memory to see what purity can buy you.  Combinatorial parsers are another interesting application in Haskell; however they should be easily implementable in Scheme, too.<p>Please have a look at how <a href=""http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/smk/redblack/rb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/smk/redblack/rb.html</a> uses the type system to statically guarantee the balance of red-black trees.<p>Please pardon that I mostly talked about the `how' and not so much the `why'.

Those last days were scarce. In a way, they are infinitely more valuable than all her other days, because she knew at that point that she had a finite number. Until you are given a terminal diagnosis, you feel infinite, and perhaps -- with the innovation in life extension -- you actually could live forever.  Of course accidents still happen and with more days to live, the law of large numbers kicks in, so we'll probably never live forever, but I digress.<p>Point being, the last days are the most valuable and the treatments to keep us alive under terminal conditions are expensive.  It's expensive to fight death and few want to die.  Most believe not dying to be the most important and valuable thing in their lives, so it is understandable that the last years, in general, cost the most to keep.<p>The only alternative to this situation is to embrace death.

1321900,comment,1321443,1321846,0,0,jerf,,,"Actually, it's the other way around; it sounds like they are talking about having lots of processors literally physically spread amongst the data. That's sort of more Erlang-y, although it isn't actually Erlang-y either. Erlang pretty deeply assumes homogeneity of the computational units it is accessing. (It does allow you to start a process on a given node, and that's a start, but the VM's strategies for memory management and copying on a given node would have to change quite substantially to cope better. Or map one node to each processor-in-the-memory in which case I'd expect too much copying between nodes to occur without a <i>lot</i> of care taken by the programmer, sort of fighting the language the whole time. Erlang lets you control where processes run, but not directly control where data lives beyond that.) Basically this future seems to be NUMA writ large, and while an ""Erlang-inspired"" language may be the way forward, Erlang itself would not make this transition without substantial changes. (Might be feasible, though.)<p>But Javascript as it stands today is even worse off, as are most languages. We don't really have much that could cope with this right now in a clean way.

I've dealt with people who were considered above average programmers and yet for whom ""floor"" wasn't obvious. They needed to look it up, and then they needed to look it up again when they saw it the second, and sometimes the third time.  It  cost them mental overhead because it was something they didn't know immediately, it's in a library, they needed to find it, and it's not actually part of the language.<p>The bitwise operators, however, they knew immediately.  They were part of the library, they could immediately deduce what was happening, because it was part of the language.  They were <i>glad</i> that someone didn't use some library call that they'd have to look up, and instead used the actual language itself, the built-in operators.  And it was clear from the context that the desired result was an int that was close to, and preferably smaller than, the float they started with.<p>So there's an alternative viewpoint, and one from my direct personal experience.  I agree entirely that code should express the intent of the programmer, and it should be clear, and that future maintenance is critical.<p>I'm not for a moment advocated that every clever, unobvious, difficult to disentangle trick you know should be used.  Of <i>course</i> it shouldn't.  Code should be clear, concise, and express its purpose.<p>But it should, above all, be maintainable.  And sometimes an idiom is short, precise, unambiguous and does what is needed, and sometimes it's easier to simply regard it as an idiom of the language and get on with it.<p>Sometimes idiomatic code is, well, OK.<p>And I'll stop there.  Feel free to disagree, feel free to dismiss my experience, thoughts and comments with an airy ""no - it's not maintainable - it's not instantly readable - it's not possible for a programmer with no experience to modify effortlessly.""

It's common knowledge among chip-design companies that as soon as your prototype board hits the fab (unless you're someone like IBM or Intel with your own fabs), it's going to be in your competitor's hands: NVidia and ATI operate on the assumption that as soon as a chip's sent to Taiwan, it's going to their competitor too. Nobody is ever prosecuted for that, either, on the side of the seller or on the side of the buyer.<p>Yes, technically selling found property is a crime, but morally, this looks more like a trade-secret dispute between businesses than a normal stolen-property dispute, i.e. the harms suffered are not primarily the loss of the device, but of the secret information. And I think people are pretty jaded when it comes to inter-business trade-secret/corporate-espionage sorts of disputes, because it happens all the time and nobody important ever goes to jail for it, even though there's a lot of wink-wink in which executives are aware of it.<p>The main difference here seems that it was made public instead of kept secret, and the people doing it were amateurs. If Gizmodo were a consulting firm instead of tabloid, paid $5k to see the prototype for a bit, took a bunch of photos and information, quietly returned it or didn't, and then quietly sold that info to one of Apple's competitors, we probably would never have heard of it.

My high school was full of corrupt assholes who spent all the school's funding on elaborate sports complexes for our shitty sports sports teams, so that all the funding to our science, math and tech clubs dissolved and the library only had a few outdated dictionaries and some terrible fiction books.<p>But I'm not bitter.

The quality of person required by a startup is much higher than what an investment bank needs, and most of the people going into IB/MC wouldn't be qualified.<p>Also: analyst programs are designed to filter for the people with an unconditional work ethic-- people who will cut corners and work 100-hour weeks but simply will not miss a deadline, no matter how arbitrary, and people who will take the most awful work with a smile on their empty faces. This is a bad employee from a startup's perspective, because startups need people who write quality code (hard to do if you're working till 3:00 am) reliably and are willing to question others' decisions.",1273078809

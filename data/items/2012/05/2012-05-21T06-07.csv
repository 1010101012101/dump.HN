4001623,comment,4001099,4001445,5,0,grepherder,,,"We have similar chess history, but I think you're being emotional here in your ""rebuttal of chess"". I've had similar thoughts but I've come to the natural conclusion that all that matters in the end is whether I enjoy playing it or not.<p>Some things you mentioned don't add up. You don't have to be a human database to play chess as a hobby, even at club level. Playing at club level can be fun, and can definitely be a healthy hobby which doesn't take more time than any other sports or any other gaming activity. If it's not fun for you, or if you obsess over how better you could get if you just studied this or that opening, or how you'll never even reach 2200 ELO, then chess is probably not for you or not fit to be a hobby for you, that is true.<p>In short, thinking you would gain more mentally that would help with your engineering skill-set by playing chess instead of just, well, studying and working as an engineer, is fallacious to begin with. If there aren't any such studies, which I doubt, then why would you assume that? Of course, if all you want to do in life is being a better engineer, then anything but doing that is a ""huge waste of time"", not just chess.<p>But I think I still understand you emotionally as we had similar thoughts. Maybe, like me, you too rationalized your time spent in chess by saying to yourself that it helps your focus and concentration at work etc., but that's really not any more logical than rationalizing smoking, in the end you're just fooling yourself spending time doing something you enjoy. I'd think this was obvious, and I knew it even when as I was doing it myself. Maybe you just needed that external heads-up, from that older engineer you mentioned.<p>On a completely different note, I could still argue chess is not entirely useless in that sense. Compared to legos, you're forgetting that chess is a social activity. You're facing real people, and beating them can build confidence, and losing also has its lessons - socially, not chesswise. I've learned a lot about competition at a young age, and I've experienced what ""winning"" and ""losing"" is like. This is different than team sports, because you're out there alone by yourself, with no luck involved. And although we don't share the same success with him, a friend who doesn't spend more than a few hours per week playing chess became rather successful (2000+ ELO), and I see that it made him a lot more confident. Also for what it's worth, a lot of people - you may find the notion stupid - perceive him to be a very smart person, which is pretty valuable socially. I think that is an incredible value gained for that effort, arguably more efficient than a college education considering all this talk nowadays about the bubble.",1337582492

Assuming perfect conditions, an airplane can climb to a desired altitude, follow a GPS course, switch to a nonprecision VOR/DME approach, and follow a precision ILS approach (and descent) to within a few hundred feet of the runway.  And that's a Cessna 172 with a mildly recent avionics package -- a modern airliner can take you to the runway surface in zero visibility.  (Taxiing and takeoff are still manual operations that require more than zero visibility, however.)<p>The reason a self-flying plane is easier than a self-driving car is because there is much less stuff in the air than on the ground, and everything in the air has a transponder that tells you its exact location and speed.  (Not true of small VFR planes, but transponders are becoming more common and if we really wanted to, we could make them mandatory.)  Compare this to a car, where there are kids running into the street, traffic lights, other drivers, loads falling off the back of trucks, and so on.  The number of things that can suddenly change the driving conditions are dramatic.  In the air, that's not the case; the environment is very controlled and you have an extra dimension to navigate in.<p>With that in mind, we're still a ways away from untrained people getting into an airplane, pressing a button, and arriving at their destination.  But honestly, that's details and risk management rather than a fundamental lack of technology.  (What happens if the engine fails?  What happens if there's a thunderstorm?  The corner cases are why you have trained pilots there to assist the computers.  If you're willing to die because of a simple mechanical or software failure, then self-flying planes are a reality today.  If you're more cautious, then not quite yet :)",1337580722

If someone spent ten hours a day doing nothing but building legos the observation would be exactly the same:  It's not good for you.<p>Chess can become a sick obsession.  I know.  I've been there. I have played chess for 12 hours straight on more than one occasion.  It leaves you rattled and with nothing good to show for it.  Contrast that to spending twelve hours with a mixed bag of skills: learning to play the guitar, watching a tutorial or two, taking in a couple TED talks, etc.<p>My greater point might be that if you have x amount of hours per day to devote to something it is probably a bad idea to devote too much of it to Chess.  You are going to get nowhere by playing chess the way you learned it.  The only way to start climbing up the ranks is to become a human database.  That takes you in a very different direction.",1337580526

4001515,comment,4001032,4001032,1,0,makecheck,,,"I guess producers are used to a world where it takes agreements with local outlets in many parts of the world to figure out how a show will be broadcast in each region.<p>When a pirated show is instantly available in a region that would otherwise wait a week, that shows an industry asleep at the wheel.  Producers should ask themselves some hard questions if they're unable to deliver a <i>better</i> format when they're the ones being paid for it.<p>As I see it the future looks something like this:<p>1. ISPs and other infrastructure companies start charging much, much more for bandwidth but <i>in exchange</i> they invest hugely in it.  The default assumption would be that everyone and his grandmother needs obscene amounts of data because this is now how they're watching TV, etc.  There would be exceptions for people who somehow use very little, just like now where some people don't own a TV and don't buy cable.<p>2. Content companies make deals with these ISPs that basically say this: ""hey, I'll produce lots of stuff people want, which will cause them to download obscene amounts of data; in exchange, give me a guaranteed cut of whatever you're charging them"".<p>3. There would be a way to buy temporary bandwidth, e.g. instead of a pay-per-view movie you rent an hour of ""high bandwidth"" and download whatever you feel like watching in that time.<p>In other words, companies have to stop pretending the Internet isn't the best way to distribute things, and customers have to stop pretending that things don't cost money.",1337580481

Although exploring the world was initially interesting -- and I enjoyed outfitting my character with a fez -- after a while wandering around squeezing chickens got a little dreary. And when you leveled up and learned new skills, most of the time they weren't all that interesting. Becoming 10% more efficient at gardening or whatnot.... It definitely seemed to be lacking a hook of some sort. I bet there are some interesting lessons for game designers there.",1352955599

Sorting algorhythms that I don't have to implement. Understanding of trees that I don't have to implement. Knowing what ""NP hard"" means.<p>That stuff gives you maybe 5 minutes of conversation with another comp sci major a year in many jobs- as those were the 5 minutes I cut to 10 seconds with a ""whatever"". Sure, some jobs require you to think like you just got a PhD in computer science. That's fine, but I worked with a PhD in computer science, and one with a masters. It made very little difference. I ended up managing the one with the PhD, not that it matters.<p>But to all of those guys and gals thinking ""so I don't need a degree in CS"" think again. What did matter was that I didn't apply for least 50% of the jobs I could have applied for, not because of my ability, but because of my lack of a CS degree that was in the job requirements (although that requirement is often bullshit). And when you have no experience then it really can keep you from getting your foot in the door. I got lucky- I had worked at a place that had a developer opening, so I was a known quantity and they knew I could pick it up. These days I think it would be easier to start off as a contractor writing Rails apps.",1352955265

4787154,comment,4785731,4787103,1,0,jfarmer,,,"The school is located in SF, but only 50% of our students come from the SF Bay Area.  45% come from other parts of the US, and another 5% from other countries.<p>We want to make DBC more affordable, but there are some very important things we get by charging students directly that we'll never compromise on.  We're working hard to make it more affordable within those constraints, though.<p>Some of the benefits we get by charging students:<p>First, the vast majority of our revenue comes from directly from students.  They're our customers.  If we made money only from employer referral fees, there'd be a financial tension between ""in-network"" and ""out-of-network"" employers.  Right now about 40% of our students are hired from companies who don't have a referral agreement with us.<p>Second, when students pay they feel it.  They demand so much of us because of what they paid.  Their bar is set incredibly high and we push ourselves every day to overshoot it.  If we're delivering the value we promise -- you'll be job-ready in 10 weeks, if that's what you want -- then we think the price tag is worth it.<p>Third, we, as staff, feel it.  When a student hands over a check like that, holy shit, you feel responsible.  They're entrusting you with their livelihood.  It helps hold us accountable to remind ourselves every day that they're not just students, but customers.<p>Fourth, when you're in a room with 50 other people who have made that kind of personal and financial commitment, you can feel it.  It's electric.<p>Fifth, we have a sustainable business.  We don't need outside capital.  We can create an awesome space.  We can have an awesome library, events, etc.  We can hire awesome teachers and pay them 2-3x what they'd make teaching elsewhere.<p>Just some food for thought.  It doesn't change your overall point about our price tag, which we're sensitive to, but those are just a few things on the other side of the scale.",1352955218

I'm at the bottom of the totem pole, so I'm not really privy to what the people at the top are thinking (and don't think what I'm saying is in any way official), but I don't think this is true.  We really do have bandwidth constraints, and it takes a small fortune plus a couple years to slog through the process of putting up a new cell site.<p>The reality is if we don't have caps some percentage of our customers is going bittorrent twenty HD movies at the same time, completely swamping that leg of our network and causing everyone else's cat videos to start buffering.  If we double our capacity they'll just double the number of movies they download at the same time.  We can't win by adding capacity.<p>The part that pisses me off about all this is everyone I know who compulsively downloads a bunch of movies hardly ever actually watches them.

The main way is the ""move"" function, which oscillates the nozzle back and forth. Usually you can activate this by pressing the spray button twice or pressing a dedicated button. You can also usually manually adjust the nozzle position to better suit your needs.\nAdditionally, some of them have dryers which further negates the need for toilet paper. My routine is usually spray, oscillate, check with one or two TP squares, and then dry. This saves me from a lot of hassle and saves a lot of toilet paper. \nExcuse my vulgarity, but I've had times where what would otherwise turn out to be a ""nightmare shit"" became a relatively pleasant experience. It's those times where I can really appreciate modern technology.\nI think Toto did a good job to try to get it to fit the majority of people's needs, but it seems some manual tweaking and button pushing is still necessary sometimes.",1352954793

4787071,comment,4786794,4786794,98,0,crazygringo,,,"These have been around for years. I put together a guide for personal use a while ago, for how to get them running under VirtualBox on OSX. Should be a similar process under Linux. I don't have a blog or anything, so I'll include them here, hoping they'll be helpful to people here, sorry about the length (I last did this a few months ago, so it should be pretty up-to-date).<p>- Extract the RAR files. On OSX use UnRarX: <a href=""http://www.unrarx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unrarx.com/</a> At least with UnRarX, it will still work despite the first RAR file being a self-extracting .exe file which, obviously, can only run on Windows. You may have to open the multi-part archive using the second file, it will still work.<p>- Install VirtualBox from <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>\nInside of VirtualBox, create a new virtual machine using the wizard. Make sure to choose the appropriate OS (for example Windows 7) and give it enough memory (the default 512MB is definitely not enough). Also, we're using 32-bit OS only. The important part is to select the .vhd file you extracted from the .rar files as an existing hard drive.<p>- Do not run the virtual machine yet. It won't work, because it's designed only to work with Microsoft Virtual PC. To make it compatible, click ""settings"" in VirtualBox to change some things:<p>- On the system tab, check Enable IO APIC. This is necessary to get your mouse to work (I think).<p>- On the storage tab, remove your VHD from the ""SATA Controller"" list. Then add the same VHD file back, only under the ""IDE Controller"" tab. The VHD is expecting an IDE controller, and you'll get a BSOD if you don't do this step.\nUnder the network tab, change ""attached to"" from ""NAT"" to ""Bridged Adapter"". This is necessary to be able to access a webserver running on your local machine, that is outside of the VM. (You don't need to do this if you just want to access websites in general). Start the Virtual Machine.<p>- You'll notice the mouse doesn't work. We'll get to that. For now, the Tab key and Alt+Tab are your friends.\nLog in with either the ""IE User"" or the ""Admin"" account. The password is ""Password1"".<p>- It will ask you to activate. Ignore for now.<p>- In VirtualBox, go to the ""Devices"" menu in your OS menu bar and click ""Install Guest Additions..."".<p>- In Windows, launch Explorer somehow. Easiest way is the ""run"" command (try Windows Key + R) and type ""explorer"".\nFrom within explorer, use Tab and Enter and arrow keys to navigate to the inserted CD. Select the ""Autorun"" file and hit ""Enter"" to run it.<p>- You are now installing guest additions. During the process, you'll need to Alt+Tab to the new prompt window to hit enter every time you need to confirm something.<p>- Once guest additions is installed, use the start menu to restart the virtual machine. Once it restarts, your mouse should now work inside the virtual machine, hooray!<p>- It will ask you again to activate. Try to activate online. If it works without asking you for a product number, awesome. If it asks you for a product number, hit cancel, open up a command prompt (run ""cmd""), and type the following:<p><pre><code>    slmgr -rearm\n</code></pre>\n(If it says you don't have permission, then try logging in under the other account when Windows starts up, if more than one account is listed, e.g. both ""Admin"" and ""Administrator"". One of them should work.) This will activate Windows for 30 days, and you can redo this every 30 days. Note: if you don't activate or run this command instead, then Windows will shut itself down after 15 minutes.<p>- Open up IE. It should be able to browse the Internet. But it will not open up sites on nonstandard ports, so browsing to your own site at something like<p><pre><code>    192.168.0.10:8080\n</code></pre>\nwill not work. To fix this, go to Internet options, then the Security tab. Click the Trusted Sites icon. Click the Sites button. Uncheck the ""Require server verficiation (https:) for all sites in this zone"" checkbox. Click Add, then type in the IP address of your machine (for example<p><pre><code>    http://192.168.0.10\n</code></pre>\n). Click Close. Then, with the Trusted Sites icon still selected, change the security level for this zone to the lowest possible setting. Now, browsing non-standard ports like 8080 should work.<p>- If you find yourself Cmd+Tabbing between the Virtual Machine and the rest of your programs, you may find that every time you Cmd+Tab back to the Virtual Machine, it opens up the windows menu. This can get real annoying real fast, because it removes focus from whatever you were working on. You can disable the ""Windows key"" inside of the VM from this Microsoft webpage:<a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216893"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216893</a> Obviously, this will disable any windows key shortcuts, but that's probably fine.

4787059,comment,4786514,4786882,7,0,sirclueless,,,"Here's one. Even though it is more varied and complex than your average Zynga pump-and-dump, at a fundamental level it is still the same kind of get-on-a-treadmill-and-keep-walking sort of game, where the primary form of achievement is watching numbers increase linearly as rewards start getting exponentially farther away. You feel almost as used while playing it as playing farmville, which kills enjoyment. That is, you are acutely aware at all times that the game mechanics are subtly or not-so-subtly designed to keep you recurrently tied to the game. To profit you need to spend a certain amount of time per day doing menial tasks.<p>Thankfully it is a real MMO, and there are some redeeming social aspects to it, but it has very little to recommend it over, say, World of Warcraft. It's a browser game, so it's more accessible, but it doesn't actually play nicely with mobile since it runs in flash, and you might as well go big or go home.",1352952873

It is a skill to make systems that can be managed by only a small number of engineers/operations types, but it is no more difficult than building a game world like this, just different.<p>I was wondering how much capital it would take to build that replacement infrastructure. If you went through game engine, databases , everything, and said ""Hmmm, ok how can we make this thing basically run itself, or at a minimum with a staff of 3 or 4."" Then you'd need a game population that supported that, and I don't know what it cost to play. But I'd love to do a deep dive into the business and technology and figure out if there was a way to make it work.

The best examples that the authors could come up with are:<p>* A professor receiving an automatic notification about when his flight was delayed. This saved him approximately 2 minutes as compared to checking the flight number before he left for the airport.<p>* Stephen Wolfram figuring out what time he likes to send emails.<p>Big data proponents need to tell a better story about how data will empower the individual.

The desired skills are usually something like RoR, ember, and backbone.  I'm sorry, but from my perspective, that is all frontend development.  This article refers to backend developers as ""sending only a HTML document as a result to the browser.""  Again, in my world, if your sending HTML, mostl likely that is frontend.<p>Backend has nothing to do with HTML or any presentation logic.  Backend is services.<p>I know this is a rather unfair judgement but so many articles seem to indicate RoR+JS/CSS+DB is the ""full"" picture of software architecture.  But really, that's frontend.

However, if you compare wikipedia's page to britannica's i think it undermines your argument against wikipedia's inferiority. Wikipedia not only has more information, but it also lists all of the contributors and has a complete list of citations. Britannica's banner ad plastered page featured only 3 paragraphs, no citations for deeper reading and no list of contributors to help you evaluate the content. I know this is just a sample size of one, but I think it shows that your opinion is extreme. As I said before, it doesn't matter where you get your info, you have to practice critical thinking and demand sources. I totally see where you are coming from, but i am not convinced that it is as bad as you are making it out to be.  \nImo, its the lack of education on how to evaluate information (this includes the ability to determine the ""authority"" of its sources) that is an intellectual travesty and a giant threat.",1367589116

I started using emacs when I was 18 and switched to vi at the age of 40.<p>The reason I switched was the I found many difficulties when I was using emacs on one hand and mouse-based editors on the other.  One problem is that you can't easily cut-and-paste out of an emacs window because of the continuation characters.  Another one is that if you use emacs and Windows editors,  you'll end up confusing ^X^S with ^S and wind up typing the wrong thing into the wrong window.<p>You can get started with vi if you know the arrow keys,  switching in and out of INSERT mode,  as well as :wq and :q!.  If you're using putty,  visual cut-and-paste works great.<p>Learn how to use / and you're cooking with gas.  I keep an old Unicos vi reference card around so I can gradually learn ""dd"",  ""G"" and other useful keystrokes.  But I was productive within 10 minutes of switching to vi.",1367588962

5650056,comment,5644880,5648987,1,0,bhauer,,,"We used 8 Vert.x verticles on i7 because there are 8 HT cores and our understanding is that the ""best practice"" for Vert.x is to create a number of verticles equal to the server's core count [1].  Obviously we would be happy to hear from Vert.x experts about an more idealized configuration.  Admittedly, we have not spent a great deal of time attempting to tune Vert.x and, like I said earlier, we have not received a pull request [2].<p>In all tests, the database test is allocating a greater amount of effort to database connection management (in totality: the handling of connections, statements, queries, and result sets) versus request handling.  This is not unique to Vert.x.  The reason some frameworks' database tests achieve nearly 50% as many requests per second on i7 versus the pure JSON test is simply that at the ~210k rps range for the JSON tests, we are running into a Gigabit Ethernet wall (which I have commented about elsewhere).  If we had 10 GBE, the JSON test results on i7 would be even higher.  (Also see comments elsewhere about our intent to normalize, to a degree, the response header requirements since the variation observed is attributable to response-headers [3].)<p>Yes, the node.js tests are running with the cluster module [4].<p>Thanks for the comments.  We have received great feedback in the previous rounds and this round received even more attention so there have been some more good questions.  Unfortunately, there has also been some rehashing, which indicates we're not doing a great job of explaining to people how each environment is configured (linking to the repository only goes so far).  That said, we also continue to receive some fantastic pull requests.

They were here long before all this sexy unnecssary stuff and will be here long after these fads pass.</i><p>Fair point. ""CRUD"" is a straw man. Actually, most apps <i>should</i> be simple. That's just good design. If CRUD is enough to solve the problem, then one shouldn't do more if it compromises simplicity or conceptual integrity.<p><i>2. Whether you want to admit it or not, everyone answers to someone.</i><p>Sure. What I like about Valve's model is that, yes, employees answer to the company. What isn't there is the middle-management extortion of ""since I can fire you, you invest in <i>my</i> career, and you're lucky if I give you a 2-week 'plum' project"".<p>Everyone answers to someone, but the terms are widely variable. We're a lucky set, being programmers. We have skills whereby, if we can solve the leverage problem (as a group, we're poor negotiators) we can deliver <i>so much</i> value to society as never to be poor. Unfortunately, because we are so critical to operations, and because we're terrible negotiators, there's a class of people (VCs, tech managers) who spends as much time devising ways to hack us as we spend coming up with ways to hack computers.<p>It's the fact of answering to a careerist middleman-- often for little in return, resulting in long-term career stagnation-- not the abstract ""answering to someone"" of having to deliver value, that makes corporate engineering so humiliating.<p><i>3. Make no mistake about it: if you build anything, you benefit, often more than those you built it for. In fact, to become an excellent programmer, there is no better way. It doesn't matter who you built it for, it just matters that you built it.</i><p>I agree, but at least in my experience, programmers are lucky if they get to spend 10-20% of their working time on <i>building</i>, and it's rare that we actually get to <i>own</i> and to <i>finish</i> a project.<p>Most of us get staffed on fourth-quadrant ( <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadrant-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadra...</a> ) maintenance work that's largely evaluative in purpose, while the company decides whether it trusts us enough to give us real work. Of course, the managerial gatekeepers who proctor and grade this years-long dues-paying/testing period use it for hard-core extortion.<p>I think this problem (of long slogs on evaluative make-work, and projects never getting to be finished) might be the visceral appeal of game development. Sure, it's a horrible industry if you look at the conditions, but unlike much of software, you actually finish and ship a product.<p>I'm 29 years old and I'm starting to have the experience of getting <i>genuinely</i> rejected for jobs that a top-talent person of my age should be able to get (and that I would be able to get, with better work experience). This is not a case ""they're idiots"" rejection (a pathetic defense mechanism) or ""lost in the shuffle"" bad luck, although that happens too. It's genuine rejection that occurs because the quality of my work experience is mediocre. There are a lot of jobs that I would be able to get at this point, had I not drawn a string of bad bosses and shit projects. Now, some of that's my fault: I should have shown initiative and started open-source hacking five years ago. Some of it is not my fault. If I had landed on a machine learning project when I joined Google, I'd be spending a lot less time ranting on HN and more time building awesome stuff.<p><i>4. Literal definition of ""professional"": earns money. There's probably no better way to be a professional programmer than to build corporate CRUD apps. Looser definition of ""professional"": someone I would want to march into digital battle with. I would most certainly pick someone who has written many corporate CRUD apps that someone who has recently embraced some sexy new technology from the conference and community du jour.</i><p>Disagree. The defining trait of a profession is a set of ethics (that one <i>professes</i>) and processes to which one subordinates. For programmers, ""don't build logic-bombs and back-doors"" would be an obvious first commandment. ""Never compromise on quality to gain rapid career progress"", i.e. ""don't launch and flee"", would be a more controversial second one.<p>When you're a professional, there are ethical principles which you have the <i>right and obligation</i> to place above managerial authority. To make sure this works, the profession controls the economy (a controversial process, for sure) in order to make sure you always have work and your boss never has you by the balls. Professionals can't use the ""just following orders"" defense. If a doctor's boss tells him to kill a patient, insubordination (against that boss, subordinate to the higher authority of the profession) is a <i>requirement</i>. He loses his license and possibly goes to jail if he fails it.<p>We don't have the right to tell our bosses, ""I won't do that, because it's unethical"". Nor do we have the right to expect our bosses to invest in our careers-- and, most often, they don't. Ergo, I'd say that we're not professionals.",1367586711

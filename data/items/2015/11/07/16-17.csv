Also interesting - huge apartments (>100 m^2) are nowhere near to being proportionally expensive (except on the top end) because people can&#x27;t afford them - eg. they might be double in size but only 1/2 more in price.",1446915595

These speakers are built to fill a living room and should be listened to at a distance. They come in fancy shapes and exotic wood finishes and are hyped for that full and rich musical sound. Hi-Fi speakers are meant to look and sound pretty.<p>In contrast, nearfield studio monitors are designed to be placed within a few feet of you in a small room that is close to dead, acoustically speaking. Instead of complementing the source, studio monitors need to be detailed, neutral and reveal problems to the critical listener. If something sounds off, they should let you know.<p>The difference between a Hi-Fi speaker and a studio monitor is like the difference between a fan and a friend. A fan will flatter you. A friend will tell you the unvarnished truth. That’s probably why most monitors look as sexy as a black brick.</i><p><a href=""http://www.nethervoice.com/2013/12/04/the-truth-about-studio-monitors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nethervoice.com/2013/12/04/the-truth-about-studio...</a>",1446915347

Learn your acronyms to get attention from these folks (you have about 5 of the 30+ that Amazon Web Services is very informed about on their pages) - they won&#x27;t care about a product unless they are confident that their vendor understands compliance very much. This is a huge reason for the shift by enterprise to AWS when people joked that it&#x27;d never pass enterprise muster - they started packing tons of alphabet soup and whitepapers along with reference customers at the right conferences. I might try to get a vendor partnership or something with someone to get a reputable logo namedropped onto that page or two specifically under compliance. The big win will be with an actual quote with a specific outcome from a reputable reference customer. That&#x27;s hard in security space but perhaps a F1000 could work instead of a F500 / F100...<p>3. Cost doesn&#x27;t matter generally when it comes to enterprise purchases because for most start-ups what they can charge is insane (but is a problem for people-centric tech vendors like old school software companies that are themselves very bloated and inefficient capital-wise), $1M is a rounding error for most F100 companies and POCs are paid maybe like, $100k for a few months or so maybe, which is easy to float most start-ups even with a regional account manager that commands a $600k / yr comp package. So don&#x27;t bother with a pricing section, it&#x27;ll go out the door in the middle of negotiations anyway.<p>4. Password management of endpoints is not mentioned and that&#x27;s a huge reason that companies buy software like this, not for team / user passwords (the user penetration rate compared to shared sticky notes and tribal knowledge is pretty poor - trust me, I don&#x27;t even do it and I just drop it in a private gist or something because just logging into a system is enough inconvenience).<p>5. No prominent &quot;talk to a representative&quot; kind of link. Most of these people want to talk to a human / sales person first (they want a throat to choke if things go wrong - they want a relationship, not a product / service), and they don&#x27;t want to read a whitepaper probably either. Some rather technical folks will be interested, but the number of info security executives I&#x27;ve seen that are still technical to the degree they could understand a solid security paper in a F100 are countable on one hand from my experience.<p>From a more abstract level, it really doesn&#x27;t sound the most friendly / human-centric of a pitch to me, it might as well be a set of bulletpoints. It doesn&#x27;t look like a &quot;here are your problems, here&#x27;s how we&#x27;ll solve them&quot; narrative. Most successful enterprise and b2b pitches are based around demonstrating you have competency in solving the fundamental problem through <i>using</i> your product / service, not selling the technical product or anything at all. For example, Square had the problem where they were compliant, simple, and everything awesome after tons of feedback, but merchants didn&#x27;t care. Then with some real-life reference users they broke through.<p>For a reference point of &quot;quality,&quot; the Cyberark vault implementation in place where I&#x27;m now is horrifically bad - 8 character passwords rotated through maybe every day and passwords are locked when a user checks it out, and only administrators can break locks on &quot;checked out&quot; passwords. So it means single user mutual exclusion root access to a server. Supposedly we don&#x27;t use anyone else because nobody else would bend to the really bad / insecure demands we asked, but I am no authority on the steps that led to such a poor system.<p>The enterprise security model is that every administrative access to systems must be gated somehow behind 2FA or a physical presence (ID badge swipe works). VPN counts perhaps, but then we&#x27;re asked for 2FA again when accessing passwords. But even with this secrets store system most admins that are productive here don&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s so restrictive UX-wise (it doesn&#x27;t support ssh key access, for example). There&#x27;s a separate effort going on for ssh key management that&#x27;s being custom-developed with some partners, and that&#x27;ll take so long it&#x27;ll be 2017 probably before it&#x27;s released.<p>Anyway, best of luck. Enterprise is a hard space to break into but once you&#x27;re in you&#x27;re basically in for life at this point even if your software is so bad that it directly causes the death of someone... unless a lawsuit is involved. Then you&#x27;re out the door in less than a week. That&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve seen enterprise companies take swift action on that destroys start-up competencies - legal issues.",1446913838

I come from a background in BI and data warehousing, so I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with SQL as a second language, as I like to call it.<p>Here are a few things I understand as unique in SQL, some of which clearly do add unique difficulties:<p>* Everything not a SELECT is stateful - unit testing becomes difficult<p>* Syntax/semantics are far from most &quot;normal&quot; languages (not C-like, not similar to shell scripting, not OO, not functional, verbose in a style similar to COBOL, the hated)<p>I, personally, do not find large SQL codebases particularly difficult to work with correctly or understand. Perhaps this is a combination of ignorance and Stockholm Syndrome since most of my experience is in databases and heavy SQL work. I&#x27;d like to understand better why the attitude in the excerpt I quoted seems so common.<p>Ninja edit: Additionally, I find a lot of power and expressiveness in the relational model. Again, perhaps because of the focus of work I do I find SQL indispensable and very easy to use for both exploratory programming and data analysis, as well as robust programming e.g. for ETL processing. Note: I still use ETL tools and frameworks, but this is not to remove SQL from the equation, but for the better dependency tracking and process monitoring.",1446912853

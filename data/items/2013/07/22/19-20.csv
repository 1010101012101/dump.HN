The motivation is that they want people who enter the country to have enough cash on hand to be able to pay for an apartment deposit, and their initial rent, food, etc. until they get an income stream flowing. If someone enters the country with only, say, $500 cash on hand, there&#x27;s a significant chance they could end up homeless and/or needing to draw on social-welfare services almost immediately if their anticipated income stream falls through or is delayed.

It costs them next to nothing (the venture capitalists / angels are picking up the tab) and they get more skilled workers either way.<p>I think quite a few entrepreneurs will see this as a way of moving to the states without the drawbacks (it&#x27;s North America, after all) and may eventually use it as a stepping stone to the US if they&#x27;re successful.<p>Compared to London, Berlin, Prague or Hamburg I&#x27;d stay in Europe if I had to make the choice.<p>If you already have a life on the go in some other place $50K is peanuts when moving to another continent.

The screen will likely be 1024x768 or similar, seeing as how they say that they are shooting for around 300ppi in a 4.5in screen. The battery technology that they say they want is unproven, produced only in sample quantities, and has issues with the electrolyte expanding to 4x it&#x27;s size (which they say will be fixed via carbon nanotubes, the latest &#x27;magic pixie dust&#x27;). I am pretty sure they will have an announcement later on saying that they had to switch battery technologies in order to source what they need. For $800 it&#x27;s quite expensive. I imagine they could easily just buy a bunch Galaxy S4s and offer that with Ubuntu as an option... that way they wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with certification and all that jazz. I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong, but seriously people need to think about this before just handing out their money. My bet is one year from now if you had given them your money, there will be better phones out that make this one seem like a joke. Compare what they are offering to the Galaxy S4, the S4 will definitely have a better screen, it&#x27;s running at 1.9ghz (will 2.1 or whatever is the fastest make much of a difference? probably not). A better battery may be great, but the S4 has great battery life, which will last almost all day, good enough for most people. I&#x27;d be surprised if I don&#x27;t see batteries explode on this device if they do manage to ship with the new technology (and expensive) battery.

And it didn&#x27;t take much time to setup.<p>Progressive enhancement is &quot;The Right Way&quot;, for sure, but there are some projects where we just aren&#x27;t concerned with targeting users without Javascript. That said, hopefully this will let us cater to many of those users, reap the SEO benefits, and provide a better first-landing experience for those not hitting the home page.<p>Edit: This is the grunt plugin we are using for this: <a href=""https://github.com/cburgdorf/grunt-html-snapshot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cburgdorf/grunt-html-snapshot</a>",1374521343

Conversely, if our product has a reputation for good SEO, it can drive a lot of business to us.<p>Also, Monocle.io isn&#x27;t setting the title tag for any of their URLs, so that&#x27;s a pretty poor example to use wrt SEO.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a real, in-depth article that discusses the following:<p>- At this point, should I use hash-fragments or pushState?<p>- Which front-end JS framework (backbone, ember, angular, etc) has the best support for SEO features out of the box?<p>- Is Rails 4 + Turbolinks SEO-friendly?<p>- I&#x27;d love to see some kind of experiment/example showing that a JS/hash_fragment based site can actually rank well when competing against basic HTML sites.

The only thing blocks seem to be able to do that C++11 lambdas do not is that multiple blocks are able to share mutable data<p>Blocks are also a bit simpler if you want to continue to mutate the same variable both inside and outside of a lambda (but then have the variable stay alive after the outer function exits).<p>> As for the type erasure, a block is pragmatically an instance of NSBlock, which is represented as &quot;?&quot; in the type signature and is morally equivalent to an object id. There is therefore an implicit conversion from blocks of all types to id.<p>All objects are also represented with the same character, and all function pointers are ^?.  This may be unfortunate, but isn&#x27;t really about blocks; in pure C, of course, they are only erased inasmuch as all types are erased.<p>> The reason this is important is that if you have a random object, you want to be able to send it an arbitrary message and not be concerned you got the type signature wrong; the worst that can happen is that the object doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>How do you mean?  If you have a random `id`, or possibly an object casted to the wrong object type (isn&#x27;t that the equivalent scenario, since you&#x27;re talking about implicit casting from id to blocks of any type signature?) and send it a message for a selector it implements but with different types, the call will go through and probably crash, same as if you cast a block to the wrong type.",1374521191

But if I take a look at what our actual governments and authorities are doing (PRISM, Stand your ground laws, voting rights act, recent news of censorship in Britain etc. pp.) it seems it couldn&#x27;t be much worse &quot;under Google&#x27;s rule&quot;. sigh.<p>Of course, the blog post is a bit naive, but it probably was just meant as a discussion starter. I&#x27;ve been thinking about a very similar plan.<p>This is what I&#x27;d do if I were filthy rich and ruthless:\n- Buy a large part of the city. I mean properties, buildings, infrastructure.\n- Arrange special terms with city and state. Make Googletown into a separate entity, with its own city government etc.. If you wait for another major crash, the US might be so desperate that you can arrange for extraterritorial status.\n- Maybe one could arrange that unused interesting property can be expropriated or forcefully sold.\n- Make Googletown into a Special Economic Zone.\n- You don&#x27;t only get the property, but also everybody who lives on it. Not as your servants :-) but as citizens of Googletown.<p>Why?\nThe idea is that you&#x27;ll have a lot of very cheap workers, who will be extremely loyal to you for saving their city, if you pull it off correctly. You can produce all kinds of (cheap) goods at competitive prices, and sell them on the north American market. And you can run experiments - sure, Google Cars, but I&#x27;m more interested in <i>social</i> experiments (see below).<p>Why would Detroit/Michigan/the US agree to my plan?\n- It would provide immediate relief. As someone in this thread noticed, the debt is much less than the total value of the city. Paying the debt is peanuts in comparison.\n- They&#x27;d get rid of many bad = cheap parts of the city.\n- You&#x27;d take care of the people for them - providing healthcare, social security, police, etc..<p>How would I rule Googletown? I&#x27;d let it organize democratically, but I&#x27;d take care that I&#x27;d control the general direction of development. On one hand, I&#x27;d try to make it a liberal model town / experiment. Gay marrage, strict gun control, universal healthcare... a republican&#x27;s nightmare :-).<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m trying to run a very troubled town. People are poor, not well educated, there&#x27;s a lot of crime. People are accustomed to doing stuff their way, and won&#x27;t likely adapt well to a googletopian society. So it&#x27;s not just carrot, but unfortunately also stick. (Wow, that sounded really Machiavellian. Honestly, I hope no one ever tries to pull this off.). One necessary thing would be to crack down on organized crime and gangs. Increase police presence, expell all gang members from the city bounds. Ban all weapons. Regard organized crime as treason against the people, and have draconian punishments for it. Robocops.<p>Again, I find it sad and scary that we&#x27;ve come to the point where I&#x27;m actually considering a benevolent corporate dictatorship to be a worthwhile alternative to our current system.",1374521020

And even if they do, they are very lax at interpreting claims. And even then, most posters frequently misunderstand the terms used (case in point, Spolsky&#x27;s very post! <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6084884"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6084884</a>). All this leads them to post irrelevant prior art.<p>That does not mean there are no useful answers at all; there are, but they mostly come from people who are somewhat versed in patent law (such as agents, lawyers and examiners). Some re-wording of claims, such as what Micah Seigel does in his posts, helps, but for the proportion of useful answers to go up, we need more education about how patents work for this to be useful. It&#x27;s really not that hard; heck I did it!<p>2) It&#x27;s wayyy too soon for a victory lap because that was only the first non-final rejection, for which a response has already been filed. Statistically, this application will undergo 2.5 more rejections [1] and (based on my guestimate) at least one Request for Continued Examination (RCE) before being abandoned or (more likely considering the applicant) issued with much narrower claims.<p>3) Patents are worded so not (primarily) to be obfuscating, but rather because of legal, technical and some silly historical reasons. For instance, pronouns are very rarely used because <i>any</i> indefiniteness can be cause for invalidation. Obfuscation will not help much, because you are not trying to get it past lay engineers, but patent examiners, who have a technical background and are (usually) adept at reading patentese. Complaining about how hard it is to read patents is like a Blub programmer complaining about Lisp. You simply need to learn the language to appreciate what you are reading.<p>4) Most &quot;software&quot; patents (which can&#x27;t even be cleanly categorized as such) are not crappy, at least with respect to all other patents. There are studies presenting this view [2, 3], but it&#x27;s also based on my experience having read hundreds of patents. Almost none are revolutionary, but just as few are really as bad as the media portrays. The PTO has gotten pretty good at finding prior art (interestingly around the same time Google came around), and the really broad patents are dying out.<p>The &quot;crappy software patents&quot; view is common mostly because tech media routinely publishes uninformed (or disinformed? [4]) rhetoric, mostly because they garner some easy rageviews, and audiences accept it without critical thought. I do think the bar for non-obviousness should be different, but solving that is a difficult, almost-philosophical problem.<p>5) In response to various comments on this thread regarding pay-for-prior art schemes, initiatives such as Article One Partners already exist.<p>I am not a patent lawyer or an agent, but I believe in the patent system, as I have actually worked for the mythical small-guy firm that was ripped off by the big guys and almost died, but eventually prevailed with patents. You don&#x27;t hear these stories much because typically the small guys don&#x27;t have the PR budget for it [4]. (And also because many of those with patents turn to trolls, who like to keep a low profile.)<p>I have only recently become personally invested in the patent system, but I want all inventions, including mine, to be truly novel and worthwhile. And I want people to get off their butts and do something rather than complain about patents on HN. This is why I support Ask Patents.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/patents/main.dashxml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/patents/main.dashxml</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=650921"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=650921</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=970083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=970083</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html</a>",1374520773

6085886,comment,6083918,6085814,4,0,ritchiea,,,"Well who are they trying to attract with this visa? If you are the kind of person that has 50K in savings, is this startup visa really going to help you? If you have 50K in savings you are already wealthy on a global scale even though you are not really a person of high net worth (after all to have 50K in savings you have to have earned a healthy income in some line of work that allows you to save or have a wealthy family).<p>My impression of this kind of visa is it is should be attempting to attract young people with high potential but without necessarily having other great routes to the life they desire in North America. If you think they are targeting a different audience, say older foreigners with established businesses/careers who just want to move to Canada then 50K is reasonable.<p>Also there&#x27;s definite risk on one side here, otherwise it&#x27;s an opportunity for no one. If you have $50K of your own, why start a company in Canada rather than SV? I think to make this a worthwhile visa, Canada has to take on the risk that they are going to let someone into their first world country with a good social safety net because that person has untapped potential. Canada takes the risk if the savings threshold is low, but if the savings threshold is high they are not creating much of an incentive to move to Canada rather than an established startup hub and its the entrepreneur taking the risk.",1374520765

I never felt the need to leave my rural community and &quot;get by&quot; just fine on my HS diploma.<p>I remember in high school my peers would lament about getting out of here as soon as possible, but I never had the same affliction. I always felt I could bring the perks of the world to me, and feel like for the most part I have succeeded with that. I&#x27;ve maintained &quot;big city&quot; programming jobs for more than a decade now, and I get to do a little farming on the side for the enjoyment of it, which brings in it&#x27;s own not-insignificant income.<p>I feel like I might lose a little bit on the entertainment side of life, especially as I get older, but frequent trips to the city does mitigate that problem somewhat. On the flip side, if anything, access to technology might be better here. For instance, the farm has a fibre optic connection to the internet and top notch cell service. I don&#x27;t even find that when I visit the neighbouring cities. I think that is pretty important for someone with an interest in technology, like myself.<p>I guess I just don&#x27;t see why teachers hearts would be broken.

Your comments about Apple on this thread are worth contemplating.<p>There seems to be this silly idea that Apple is now &quot;more than a (proprietary) hardware company&quot;.  But if we took away the design-patented, hermetically-sealed enclosures, what is the value of Apple?  What&#x27;s left that we can use?  Can any of it stand on its own?<p>It should be obvious, but only after you tie users to a particular piece of hardware do the other opportunities like playing middle man to digitized consumables like music, software or books arise.  I surmise it is those opportunities that cause people to believe Apple is more than a hardware company.  But maybe Apple is just a hardware company that, outside of their area of expertise - hardware, is very opportunistic?  &quot;Good artists copy, great artists steal.&quot;<p>How many times have we seen Apple &quot;borrow&quot; from third party software that supplements Apple&#x27;s OS functionality and proceed to incorporate others&#x27; ideas into their next OS version?<p>Are all the components of Apple&#x27;s allegedly diversified business dependent on the success of Apple hardware?  Try the following thought experiment:<p>Subtract the fact of the Apple hardware with its attractive form factor and imagine other companies designing the world&#x27;s most popular mp3 players, phones and tablets.  Imagine Apple does not make, sell, or have made hardware enclosures or the cheap, Chinese-made electronics that are hidden inside.  Now, ask yourself, &quot;What is the value of Apple?&quot;<p>The value of iTunes without Apple hardware?<p>The value of the AppStore without Apple hardware?<p>The value of Apple&#x27;s latest Mach/BSD hybrid OS without Apple hardware?  OK, but how easily can Apple&#x27;s graphics layer run on other hardware?<p>...<p>Filemaker Pro for Windows?  Eureka!<p>Yes, Apple is much more than just a hardware company.",1374520083

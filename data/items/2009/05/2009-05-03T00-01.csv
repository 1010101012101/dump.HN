I don't know how many, though.  I just ordered a Dell Mini 9 (it was $50 when purchased with the Latitude E6500 that I was already ordering), but it's got Windows XP on it from the factory.  I'll certainly be reinstalling it with Fedora or Ubuntu the day it arrives, though (likewise the Latitude).",1241311870

I fear that if people didn't file their taxes themselves they would lose all respect and recognition of how much they pay for their government, which is bad for democracy.<p>The easier taxes become, the less people complain about paying them. The government then has an easier job of justifying how they spend that money. Arguably, taxes should be as inconvenient, difficult, and painful as possible.<p>On the other hand, having to file taxes really sucks and I would rather not do it. So there's an argument both ways.",1241311538

Maybe you spend your time writing love poems (ha ha, cliché right?), after all you'd be surprised how much something like this can be attractive. Imagine being this poet and going to a school that allows you to be taught by a world-class mathematician without any requirements other than sheer tenacity and zeal. I admit the first thing that popped in my head is that a poet might be one of the most enthused in such a situation.<p>After all, who is anyone to trivialize the pursuit of knowledge from motivated students who are by their very nature yet to be categorized or to have created a deep identity. It's like so many universities are swaying towards vocational training. No, I'm not making fun here, vocational schools have their uses, but one of the great things of a higher-education is the continuance of encountering things that you wouldn't otherwise find without the help of someone who knows the terrain.<p>Just imagine.",1241311162

From my experience, one learns a helluva lot from an internship when you're not thinking about the money and spending more time loving whatever it is your working on.  I don't think there are many Python shops around here, but I do know a few openings you might be interested in ;-).",1241310466
590360,comment,590094,590094,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I talked to a guy at a party who sells rooftop solar systems here in Ohio (supposedly 75% of San Diego's sun).  For up to a eight kilowatt system, 80% will be reimbursed via grants from a combination of the state and federal government.  So, instead of paying $50K, I'd only pay $10K up front for a system that might last 20 years.<p>He said that it would generate 10,000 kwh of power per year on my roof.  At about ten cents/kwh, that's about a grand.  So, a 10% ROI doesn't sound too bad although I question the maintenance cost stream over the product's lifetime.<p>However, it's not so rosy.  The power company (at least in Ohio) only must pay about three cents per kwh to the homeowner for putting power back onto the grid.  So, at least some percentage of that 10% ROI gets turned into a three percent ROI.<p>Even at 80% off, it's still a bad deal at current pricing levels!",1241310381

This, too, seemed to work well for most people without unfairly restricting the liberty of those who would rather manage their own financial affairs.",1241309646
590352,comment,589852,590311,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"OK, so then to be sure I'm understanding, let me walk through how Django (in the default auth backend -- this is customizable if you want to plug in another scheme, as people often do) does it:<p>1. The ""password"" field in the DB holds a value of the form ""algorithm_name$nonce$hash"".<p>2. ""algorithm_name"", by default, is SHA1, but the backend lets you also use in MD5 (for backwards compatibility) or Unix crypt if you're running on a platform which has it.<p>3. ""nonce"" is the first five digits of the hex digest of a pair of floats pulled (at the time the password is set) from Python's 'random.random()' (which, of course, is a PRNG, not a truly random source of numbers).<p>4. ""hash"" is the result of applying the algorithm to the combination of the plain-text password and the nonce.<p>It's a bit confusingly set up internally because the code refers to the nonce as ""salt"" even though it's different (within the limits of Python's PRNG) for each stored password. And there's some fun legacy stuff in there that transparently switches naked MD5 hashes over to the algo/nonce/hash scheme when possible, which makes even more fun.<p>As best I can tell, this is the sort of scheme you're recommending, or at least that you're not outright bashing. Is that correct, or have I missed something?<p>We've had requests to open up the variety of hashing algorithms supported in the default backend, and AFAIK the jury's still kinda out on that one due to various compatibility issues with existing DBs and older Pythons, and the ease with which alternate authentication schemes can be plugged in.",1241309638

Come on.</i><p>and that's what I'm calling you on based on our earlier discussions. I'm not making any point about how this compares to other security flaws, I'm just trying to figure out where you <i>really</i> stand on plaintext.<p>An earlier quote from you as I try to sort this out:<p>> <i>People get to access password hashes as soon as you mess up a single database query. The idea behind storing safe hashes is to prevent your stupid mistakes from screwing over every one of your users. The stupidest people of all are the ones who assume they aren't going to make stupid mistakes.</i><p>So, the question at hand: Is it an embarrassing security flaw to use plaintext passwords for a modern, respected website?",1241309631

590348,comment,590256,590256,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"It's probably been ten years since I even thought about looking something up in a CDROM encyclopedia, but even now it's kind of sad to think that Encarta is gone.  When I was a kid, my dad bought a double-speed CDROM drive for our Digital Equipment Corporation 486-powered computer, and the 1994 edition of Encarta.  At the time, Encarta was the best possible reference for a curious kid.  If you just wanted to learn about something interesting, it was way easier than flipping through heavy encyclopedia volumes.  I'm sure plenty of this site's readers have innocently gone to a Wikipedia page to look something up, only to find themselves reading a completely unrelated page a half hour later.  Encarta was deep enough for a kid to do just that.<p>Some time around 1994 or 1995 (just after we got a modem), I remember reading an article in a magazine comparing three CDROM encyclopedias: Encarta, World Book, and Compton's.  There was a sidebar, entitled something like ""What about the Web?""  The conclusion was that while the Web was promising, it just wasn't comprehensive enough to replace a CDROM encyclopedia.  It's funny to think how far we've come.<p>Finally, it's interesting to see how irrelevant encyclopedias are for current schoolchildren.  When I was in middle school and early high school, an encyclopedia was the first thing you went to if you needed to write a typical school paper.  In eighth grade I had to write a research paper on a topic of my choice; I remember my teacher telling us that while we could start our research with an encyclopedia, we were forbidden to cite it as a source.  My eighth-grade brother says he always starts a paper by reading up on Wikipedia -- he's never looked up anything in a traditional encyclopedia.",1241309332

You'll definitely get some odd looks as a non-student, but there's nothing stopping you.<p>However, given that, I would shy away from the intern route.

682214,comment,680578,682005,0,0,sho,,,"Hm. I am not so sure about that. There are many societies around the world in which the rich live in near-obscene luxury while mere kilometres away the masses huddle in abject poverty, dying of curable illnesses, helpless and starving while their betters fly past in their Mercedes and helicopters. They do not rise up.<p>I think the rule of law will prevail for the most part, and private security will make up the gaps. Whether this is just or injust is left for the reader to ponder but I don't think radical life extension for the rich will prompt revolution.",1246431594
682213,comment,682128,682128,0,0,gojomo,,,"IANAL, and this is not legal advice, but I have heard this analysis from software engineers wiser than me:<p>Unless you have very specific expertise in the interpretation of patents, given their specialized lanaguage and all the circumstances of related law and practice, you are highly likely to misinterpret them in expensive ways.<p>Further, if there's evidence you've knowingly infringed a patent, damages are much larger. So in some ways it's better <i>not</i> to seek out information about related patents, unless it is a part of your professional job description.<p>When you're applying for your own patents, a certain amount of research about prior work and patents is necessary. But otherwise, you can wait for those with patents to inform you of their claims. That call may never come; it will typically only come if you're successful, and at that time the deep expert analysis of specific situations becomes cost-effective.<p>(A different analysis for other engineering domains -- hardware, chemicals/materials, drugs, etc. -- may apply; this analysis most pertains to software and business methods.)<p>Also, you mention business process patents. They might not survive in current form past the present Supreme Court session.

Google has have hired some of the core Python developers, and some of its infrastructure is written in it...

Given that this work was done partially by people at Adobe, there's a good chance they will include it in the next version of their video-editing tool.<p>In general, the computer graphics industry is incredibly fast at picking up research developments (often under a year for many of the CGI/FX studios). Other areas of computer science typically have much longer lags between research results and industry adoption.",1246430886

There is some research supporting unittesting (McConnell writes about it in Code Complete) it doesn't find even half of the existing bugs though, and it should be supported by other testing methods.<p>The main-big-very-nice advantage of unittesting is that any bug that is _does_ find is easily found and fixed.",1246430606

I imagine as the language and community grow and mature they will shed these associations and hopefully create a language worth taking seriously. They haven't done that yet (strictly in my opinion).",1246428651

It's just really fucking hard compared to what most people can do so like all things, skills bring money.  The fact is most people work as unskilled labor.  If you can learn to do a job sufficiently in a couple of months, you're an unskilled laborer.<p>For those people, numbers like 38k, 40k, and 50k sound absolutely fucking HUGE.

We'd run 30/45/60 day free trials, bundle offers, one-time offers, and so on.  I mean we ran literally hundreds of split tests every year.  The funny thing is that we went a few years before trying a low $1 trial (for a $100+ item) on a whim, and you know what?  It out-pulled almost every free trial test we'd ever run.  Then we bumped it up to $2.95, and that out-pulled $1 even more.<p>All this time we'd been running free trials because common sense said that's what would pull best.  Not testing this earlier was literally a multi-million dollar mistake.<p>This taught me a valuable lesson: never make any assumptions about what will or will not work, and test all time.",1246428193

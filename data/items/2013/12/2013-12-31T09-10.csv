6989834,comment,6989624,6989702,2,0,kaloyan,,,"Agreed, comparing a median to a total is misleading. Even if it were an average-to-average comparison, it would not tell the entire story. There are more factors that determine one&#x27;s debt situation in addition to money owned and money made. A much more telling graph would be monthly student loan payment -- at the prevailing interest rate and terms -- to disposable income. I imagine it would still be showing a worrying trend but, likely, not as bad as the original graph.",1388483927

You can avoid this: instead, only have a system call to execute a file of <i>bytecode</i>. Everything in userspace would target that bytecode format as if it were the machine&#x27;s instruction-set. The kernel would then have to have an interpreter and JIT built into it, and do static safety checking--ala Google&#x27;s NaCl sandboxing--before it ran the results. Both are CPU-costly, but doable, and the results could be cached.<p>Of course, root would still have to write the compiler... because the true &quot;compiler&quot;--the one targeting the native machine-architecture--would be the kernel.",1388483915

6989829,comment,6988895,6989069,7,0,captainmuon,,,"I&#x27;ve lived in both the United States and Germany for long periods of time. In general, these are two modern, democratic countries, not typical oppressive regimes, an 99% of the people have nothing to worry about 99% of the time.<p>The problem are the 1% who express the wrong ideas at the wrong time. I know people who have been put under surveillance or charged in court for things that are perfectly legal, or just minor infractions. Some examples from Germany:<p>One guy I knew made a poster protesting against nuclear power, and put it up near his university. About a year later he got a letter saying that the &quot;proceedings against him have been terminated&quot;. He found out that the police suspected him of planning a terrorist attack against a nuclear waste transport. They bugged his cell phone, his apartment, and followed him and his friends for about a year, until they realized they have the wrong guy.<p>A friend of mine made a mistake of visiting a squatted house an being seen there. Later he went to a demonstration, got filmed by the police, and charged with something you could translate as &quot;ring leadership&quot; or &quot;inciting a riot&quot;.<p>There also was a famous case last year where a pacifist pastor who visited a anti-nazi demonstration was charged with something similar [1]. (And of course there are numerous examples from the US.)<p>The thing is, the threshold invading people&#x27;s privacy is getting lower and lower. Police or intelligence agencies will put you under surveilance if they just have a hunch. At the same time, persecutors are under really high pressure to &quot;make a case&quot;. More and more they will rather convict an innocent on dubious grounds than admit a mistake. Actual quotes from judges (paraphrased): &quot;we need to make an example&quot;, and &quot;I don&#x27;t know if the accusations are technically true, but if you were there [at the demonstration], you have to be guilty of something&quot;.<p>A situation like this is unworthy of a democratic society. As I said, stuff like this doesn&#x27;t happen to 99% of the people. But you never know when you are in the 1%. I have to be afraid to say anything controverisal - I have firecrackers and vinegar at home, what if some overeager investigator decides I want to make a bomb out of it? And this kind of fear is what they call a &quot;chilling effect&quot; - people will stop using their democratic rights, their right to free speach and freedom of assembly and so on.<p>[1]: <a href""http://news.msn.com/world/german-pastor-faces-trial-over-anti-nazi-protes"" rel""nofollo"">http://news.msn.com/world/german-pastor-faces-trial-over-ant...</a>",1388483832

6989827,comment,6984525,6987641,3,0,lazyjones,,,"> <i>more of a ridiculous over the top reaction in fear of being accused of going soft on terror.</i><p>As you wrote yourself, terrorism is a minor issue in the US. Most of the fear is fueled (and some of it created) by the government, because it&#x27;s so convenient for manipulating the population. Therefore the government itself cannot be driven by the fear of being accused of going soft in this matter, because if that was the case, it&#x27;d simply stop perpetuing this fear of terrorism.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but there is no cheap way out for this goverment. It&#x27;s fundamentally evil and corrupt, it uses terrorism to keep a certain elite in power and to channel taxpayers&#x27; money to the pockets of the military-industrial complex. That&#x27;s the only logical explanation I&#x27;ve seen so far.",1388483755
6989826,comment,6986797,6987798,5,0,Confusion,,,"It&#x27;s interesting how people are attacking you for using &#x27;pseudo-intellectual&#x27;, while completely disregarding the &#x27;cult-like reverence&#x27; bit. Your question is just as damning without the &#x27;pseudo-intellectual&#x27; adjective, yet they are trying to change that to &#x27;intellectual&#x27;.<p>This is a nice demonstration of &#x27;framing&#x27;: you frame pg as not deserving cult-like reverence because of his &#x27;pseudo-intellectuality&#x27; and people respond by explaining how he is a true intellectual. Except that the arguments they give for that assertion are wrong, because that is not the assertion for which they have arguments. Their arguments actually explain why pg is revered and they are now contorted to be arguments that seem to be meant to explain why is he is cult-like revered for his intellectuality.<p>The result is that it seem like people are tacitly acknowledging the &#x27;cult-like reverence&#x27; and are giving completely ridiculous arguments in support. The ridiculousness of those arguments is pointed out and we get into pointless discussions about what things mean, completely losing sight of the original point.<p>The bottom line is: pg is revered and reasons for that reverence are given. There is nothing cult-like about the reverence and the pseudo-intellectual part of his writings (I would use another word to describe that quality of the writings, but that is beyond my current argument), are not the reason for the reverence.",1388483746

It&#x27;s now simply up to you to manage yourself given that you have nobody to answer to anymore (at least in theory).<p>The next thing is then realizing that there is no one correct way of dealing with these issues commonly faced by entrepreneurs.  Everyone is different and therefore everyone will have different strategies or techniques that work for them as an individual.  You really just need to read up, get feedback from others (like you&#x27;re currently doing), and try a bunch of things to see what works for you.<p>With that said, here are some general rules that I feel apply regardless of many of the variables that exist.<p>1) Have a dedicated workspace.  I lock the door to ensure that my wife and daughter don&#x27;t interrupt me.  I took crap for this early on but as I explained to my wife....when I was still working at my old job she didn&#x27;t have the luxury of walking into my office and interrupting me whenever she wanted so there is no need for her to have that luxury now.<p>2) Keep your work space clean.  I struggle with this one and it&#x27;s easy to let things get out of control.  I find that when my office is a mess I want to spend less time in there and I&#x27;m more likely to plop my ass on the couch and get sucked into non-productive activity.  Taking 5 mins to do regular cleanups prevents your desk from building up and getting overwhelming.<p>3) Create habits.  Humans are habitual by nature.  Take notes on how you are spending your time for a week and you will notice patterns.  Make a schedule every morning and allocate a certain amount of time for the things you regularly focus on every day and that will help you avoid getting lost in something (like reading HN or TC) for hours before realizing what happened.  Also, if you have multiple clients/projects that you have to give daily attention to then work on them in blocks of hours to help make the limited time you have to focus un them more efficient.  It will also make tracking your time a hell of a lot easier.<p>4) Remember that things change.  Regardless of what it is...it is bound to change.  You just need to be cognizant of that fact and be able and willing to adapt. When I started working from home I was single and could work however long I wanted to, sleep whenever, etc.  Now I&#x27;m married with a daughter and life just doesn&#x27;t work like that anymore.  My schedule obviously had to change in order to effectively incorporate the new changes into my life.  I just had to adapt and go through a new period of trial and error to see what worked best.<p>Good luck working through it all and just remember to regularly schedule some time to review where you are spending your time and how you can improve.",1388481710

The problem with the current pricing is that what was once a &quot;hack&quot; (using the degree as a legal iq proxy) is now so far out of wack with the information content of the degree itself. After all, the distribution of iq doesn;t really change. so nobody is in aggregate all that better off by paying more for an iq test. there is sureley some productivity gains by &quot;better&quot; educaton over time (and these accrue to both students and to economies), but again...the rents are extracted from this production by people in structural positions of power (ie, not &quot;productivty&quot; in the normal sense; these are people who have the ability to get paid for not destroying value), long before they accrue to the more productive economic agents.<p>This disconnect between marginal productivity and actual wages for marginal work is evident in other data, eg<p><a href""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/opinion/america-in-2013-as-told-in-charts.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/opinion/america-in-2013-as...</a>",1388480735

But if I had to pick a reason, and it would be a reason based on no inside knowledge, it&#x27;s that the 8086 was a stop-gap design until the Intel iAPX 432 came out. The 432 had a lot of capabilities that mainframes took for granted, including segregation between data and executable code. Problem was that the 432 was so over-designed (which made it slow, for one problem) that it never saw production. So everyone just kind of settled on x86 and close to forty years later we&#x27;re stuck with the 8086 legacy.",1388480449

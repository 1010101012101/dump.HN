In practice many of the existing scripts make use of C bindings or rely on odd behaviors that aren&#x27;t replicated by alternate VMs. Since the alternate implementation, benchmark programs, and benchmark tools are all available, I&#x27;d recommend you put your theory to the test.

The idea of the benchmark is to actually do the JSON serialization/database access/etc.<p>I believe they have plans to add additional tests which will allow for caching and that kind of thing.<p>I don&#x27;t think that removing caching across all frameworks equally is creating &#x27;artificially hamstrung implementations&#x27; as all the frameworks would benefit from caching.",1392325183

At least, this kind of policy can be seen as a backstop to particular arrangements and policies like limiting the size or rate of transactions, requiring multiple authorizations for certain transactions, and so on.<p>The reversibility of transactions has drawbacks (one that&#x27;s of interest to me is that it serves as one motivation for reducing privacy and increasing data retention).",1392325169

Although I&#x27;d readily admit that applies to some industries more than others.<p>As an example, John Carmack (formerly of ID Software) recently posted this on twitter:<p><pre><code>  GPL never did really do anything for game code, and I do\n  wonder whether it was a fundamental cultural\n  incompatibility.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/434005981379309568"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/434005981379309568</a><p>When I was merely a user of free software, I too believed as others did, that a more restrictive (or &quot;stronger&quot; if your prefer) copy-left license was better.  However, the more years I&#x27;ve spent in the software industry, the more my opinion has varied.<p>I think it ultimately comes down to who the primary &quot;users&quot; of your code are.  If it&#x27;s an application, it&#x27;s probably ok to use more restrictive licensing.  If it&#x27;s a library, or code that&#x27;s in any way intended to be reused by others more generally, the licensing should have very few restrictions if you want to encourage wide usage and to discourage others from duplicating the work.",1392325086

This meant effectively there was no way to implement a sane backup policy. Later on, they implemented the ability to generate private keys in batches of 100. This is better, but still problematic because your backup have to be refreshed after no more than 100 operations.<p>Obviously that was a usability disaster, and so wallet designers worked around that by just using the same private key over and over again. Other people worked out secure deterministic address generation so that you could just backup a single seed once, but by the time that got standardized (BIP32) the damage was already done.<p>Blockchain.info is the most popular wallet, and they&#x27;ve taught about a million newbies to treat single-use payment codes as permanent account numbers. It&#x27;s a privacy and security catastrophe, but those issues are invisible to most people who only care about ease of use.",1392325045

The content is released under a CC license, and publised at http://kodegenet.no/#/courses/courses_raspi (Norwegian), including text, figures and screencasts.<p>The general idea is that each group of 4 kids will build a remote controlled car (with on-board Raspbery Pi computer, and hosting a Wifi HotSpot). The Pi will control the motors, and expose a webapp that can be accessed via a computer, or a smartphone.

They&#x27;re trying to figure out text search, they&#x27;re expanding the aggregation framework rapidly (which looks really interesting), they&#x27;re adding security features like auditing, etc. etc.<p>They have some unfortunate behaviors that are all attributable to their storage implementation, most prominently locking, fragmentation, and slow performance out of memory.  While they could &quot;just buy TokuMX&quot; and solve these problems with money, it would then put their engineering team in a position where they would need to relearn a big portion of their codebase, and spend time backporting features they&#x27;ve prototyped to TokuMX.  It would basically halt new development for a few months while they learn the new code, too.<p>The way I see it, MongoDB will continue prototyping interesting features and polishing some of their existing ones, and TokuMX will incorporate the ones with the most promise.  But to integrate the codebases would slow down MongoDB considerably, and I don&#x27;t think they can afford that right now.  I&#x27;m perfectly happy to sit back and merge the best features from MongoDB as they mature.<p>Put another way, if you were working on a product and someone came to you and said &quot;here let me fix a bunch of things by replacing some of the fundamental subsystems with code you don&#x27;t know,&quot; would you do it?

The process of protein fermentation is important in the circulation of matter in nature.<p>source: <a href=""http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Fermentation+Process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Fermentation+Proc...</a>",1392324086

I even get emotional about this and here is why.<p>TL;DR: I am a Brazilian and it would have been much easier for me if I had the resources I needed available in my mother language.<p>Long story:<p>I am a Brazilian. I was born in a small town in Brazil (population: 13k) and I only had access to public schools. Public schools in Brazil do have English classes, however all I remember was them teaching the verb &quot;to be&quot; in every single grade.\nWhen I was 15, in 1998, my mom found a way to finance a cheap computer for me. My first access to a computer. Everything was in English. I did not have access to internet initially, but the computer came with a few softwares installed. At the time I also asked my mom to buy me a translation dictionary, so I could learn English. Translating most of the things I was seeing on the screen did not make sense at all, so I just assumed them as part of my vocabulary giving them meanings, but not translations, like &quot;software&quot;, or software names...\nLater, with access to internet (long distance dial up after midnight), it was really, REALLY, hard to search for stuff related to programming because there was almost nothing available in portuguese. I had to learn how to translate properly what I was looking for before I could even do the search. Not sure native English speakers understand this part.\nSo what I tried to do instead was to learn English. I did that by finding lyrics of the songs I liked online (they were easy to find since no translation was needed) and translating them with the help from my dictionary. And this is basically how I learned most of the English that I know. (In fact, I never went to a real English school/class, as you can probably tell at this point by reading this).\nBut dude, I was able to do this because I put <i>A LOT</i> of effort and hours, and nights, doing this, day after day, because I really wanted to learn. (It paid off... I am a H1B living in Miami today)<p>Learning English is not for everyone. Learning another language is not for everyone.\nLearning how to code IS WAY MUCH FUN than learning how to speak another language.<p>While I always tell people to try to learn English, because they&#x27;re going to have better chances, I believe this should not be a barrier for the average people to learn programming. Or anything, really.\nYou have no idea of how many great developers in Brazil do not speak proficient English.<p>So, thanks to the guys at Stack Overflow for doing this. I&#x27;ll make sure I share this with everyone I know that always wanted to learn programming but had English as a barrier.<p>I am confident that the IT industry in Brazil will be thankful for this in the long term.<p>Thank you guys.",1392323920

HTML5 for the most part works because people use what&#x27;s portable. Html5test.com wouldn&#x27;t need to exist if this weren&#x27;t true.<p>The fact of the matter is, Web apps are more portable than Android apps, period. Take a random sample of the Chrome Web Store apps, how many of them do you think are tightly bound to be Chrome proprietary API only and won&#x27;t run elsewhere? How many of them won&#x27;t install or run on a forked Chromium?<p>Now go take a random sample of the Play store. And test those apps on say, a Chinese AOSP fork or Amazon&#x27;s fork. How many of them will run without breaking? In no way can you compare GMS dependencies to a handful of Chrome-only APIs that barely any web developers use.<p>And when we talk about open-ness, we&#x27;re talking about open source and how open the project is developed. Web standards have working groups to agree upon a spec. For the most part, the majority of new CSS or Javascript features are decided on at the W3C and TC39. That is a far cry different than the way say, future versions of Android are developed in secret. I understand some of the restrictions on why Android is developed like that but to compare it to the web or iOS is a false equivalence.<p>The fact that Web apps can&#x27;t do the kinds of things you&#x27;re talking about with respect to inter-app services has nothing to do with openness and more to do with the sandbox that the web puts apps into.<p>That said, locally installed apps can provide services to other apps through multiple techniques:<p>* Background pages (invisible HTML pages running in the background)<p>* Shared Web Workers (spawned process that lives at a known address)<p>* Custom Protocol Handler<p>* Service Workers (intercept HTTP requests for resources)<p>* Chrome Extension content page<p>* WebRTC or local web server<p>* Web Intents/Web Activities (got shelved by Google and Mozilla)<p>From your perspective, you&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s presented to the developer. But this discussion is about Independent Hardware Vendors. What does it take for someone to build their own <i>usable</i> ChromeOS device vs build a modern smartphone starting with only open source. For ChromeOS, you get very very far with the existing open source and most apps will run unchanged. For Android, if you start only from AOSP, any apps dependent on the Google cloud will be broke, and the question is, how easy is it to shim those services out and replace them, and it is far more work.<p>This is not a bash on AOSP or Android. It&#x27;s just a retort to the ridiculous idea that somehow web apps on ChromeOS are more locked in than Android.",1392323102

IIRC, I started doing this somewhere around 2008, during the heydays of Slicehost. What has changed is that you now get pretty good and reliable VPS providers for cheap and in some ways it has kind of become a cool thing to do for everyone.<p>I would, though, add a few words of caution here.<p>1. It is one thing to put together a VPS to run a bunch of sites. It is another to handle major traffic on it. Some of you have done it, some of you will learn with time how to do it, but a large number won&#x27;t. If it is critical for your site to be up 24/7 and Google is going to be your best friend in trying to understand which part of the stack is creating the bottleneck, you&#x27;ll be in for some real trouble.<p>2. Do you know how to check for rootkits? Would you know if your server has been backdoored? These days attack vectors are so complex that even experienced hands (the main reason why I don&#x27;t do this on my own anymore) have trouble saying for sure they are fully locked down. Wordpress on a public static IP represents one of the juiciest targets on the web for hackers and a big chunk of the phishing sites are hosted on servers with unpatched Wordpress installations or plugins/themes that have backdoors in them. Most of the site owners have no clue they&#x27;ve been owned till the hosting company takes them down. Please don&#x27;t wind up being one of those site owners.<p>If you are going to do this own your own, at least get something like Wordfence installed, so that you have some degree of protection in place.<p>I run most of my sites these days on Webfaction. I believe they run Cloudlinux these days, which means you get pretty consistent performance from the server, even in the shared hosting environment. The sites with greater resource requirements are moved to Wiredtree, who provide beefier, managed VPS services at reasonable rates as long as you are OK with cPanel and don&#x27;t veer too much from their standard stack.<p>Disclosure: I have no business links with Webfaction or Wiredtree.",1392322701

See, for example, leptin signaling.<p>At the anthropological level, we have good examples of several different pre-agricultural societies where food was abundant and obesity was rare.<p>At the whole-animal experimental level, researchers have demonstrated in both rats and humans that when you give an animal unlimited access to food, it doesn&#x27;t gain unlimited weight. It reaches a plateau and then resists further changes up or down from there. Interestingly enough, rats fed a diet of unlimited human junk food reach a much higher plateau than rats fed a diet of <i>unlimited</i> standard rat chow.<p>And finally, we all know people (perhaps even our younger selves) who never consciously worry about what they&#x27;re eating yet undergo very little fluctuation in weight. Judged from the perspective of a control system designer, getting that kind of stable outcome from wildly varying inputs doesn&#x27;t just happen by luck. And indeed, experimenters have shown repeatedly that &quot;naturally lean&quot; people experience reduced appetite in the days following a period of overeating. You can even deliberately perturb the system by force-feeding them, and they bounce right back to their long-term weight thanks to reduced appetite and increased metabolism.",1392321828

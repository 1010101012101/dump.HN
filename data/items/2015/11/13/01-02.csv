For others it might mean cutting back on sleep, or sacrificing a higher-paying job for one with better hours or more flexibility.<p>Finding little ways to cram your life full of learning is important, but just as important is cramming in time to digest/process what you learn so it sticks, as well as practice it.<p>Lastly, take a break.  Over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve increasingly felt a sense of disgust with myself whenever I give in to my vice and play video games.  But I also realized that I needed that cognitive downtime to reduce my stress and stay sane.  Don&#x27;t beat yourself up if you aren&#x27;t learning every waking free moment.<p>Beyond that, I personally find it helpful to read what I&#x27;m learning about while in bed at night, and find related podcasts for my commute.  I often also read on my phone while on the can.<p>Also, try mixing it up.  If you like volunteering in general, but aren&#x27;t married to something in particular, see if you can volunteer somewhere that will help you learn in the process.  And if your family commitments require taking care of kids, consider teaching them programming activities that let you dabble in new topics you want to learn.",1447379889

The latter certainly warrants authorship, but I don&#x27;t think the former does.<p>So a contribution is only a contribution if it contains an appropriate amount of NIH?<p>No programmer is going to going to want to work with academics, if they are forced to inject bogus novelty in order to get fair attribution for the real work.",1447379880

If Professor A&#x27;s grant goes away, then you just pick up more work on Professor B&#x27;s grant and Professor C&#x27;s -- all of which would be managed by the university or department, and not separately managed by each of the professors.<p>Universities already do this for essential services like janitorial work, administrative work, and centralized IT provisioning, like university-wide email or supercomputing infrastructure.<p>They even already try to do this to some degree with software. For example, there&#x27;s been a lot of software-focused hiring at the Cornell Weill school in New York City, and some political science research groups at NYU banded together to hire some big data and development staff to service more than just one professor&#x27;s line of grant-funded projects.<p>The problem is that they still fundamentally undervalue software labor and look at a programmer as simulatenously a low-level grunt and a wizard.

Would this be a search box that you type something, press ENTER, and it does a search in a normal tab or I could do something else to make it search in a private tab? Or something as easy as Chrome&#x27;s three dots > &quot;New Incognito Tab&quot; and I could immediately search from the URL bar would be fine.<p>Having played around with Firefox on my iPad, here are some things which are annoying (I mentioned a few of these elsewhere in this thread). I can see that many of these decisions were likely taking into account the limited real estate on an iPhone where I can understand the limitations, but it makes for a poor iPad experience. Safari and Chrome generally get these correct in a single app by adjusting the functionality based on the screen size.<p><pre><code>  - Adding a tab takes two steps: click the number box then\n    click &quot;+&quot; to add a tab.\n  - Closing a tab takes two steps as well. Why no &quot;x&quot; to close?\n    The &quot;star&quot; icon is exactly where I&#x27;d expect the close option\n    to be. Consider the frequency of someone closing a tab vs.\n    marking a URL as a favorite and the resulting UI should be\n    obvious.\n  - Adding a private tab is three steps: click the number box,\n    then click the Private Browsing icon, then click &quot;+&quot;.\n  - Swapping between regular and private tabs involves three\n    steps: click the number box, enable/disable the private\n    icon, then click on the tab you want to focus on. In Chrome,\n    this is one step: click the Incognito icon which immediately\n    swaps between the most recent active tabs in each mode.\n  - You can only view one tab at a time. Not only does this make\n    switching between tabs tedious but you also lose context;\n    not seeing a tab you&#x27;ve opened in the background that you\n    mean to read later will generally go unread.\n  - &quot;Settings&quot; available via the tab management interface. This is\n    a rather unintuitive location to manage application settings.\n    Why not have app settings available from within the iOS\n    Settings app?\n  - Editing the URL of a tab hides the tab&#x27;s content. Not sure what\n    the thinking was here, but if I want to access thumbnails,\n    bookmarks, etc. I&#x27;ll do this from a new tab, not by manually\n    editing a URL. Consider the use case of a URL shown in a web page\n    but it contains tracking info. I might want to manually type it\n    instead of clicking, so when the page contents vanish it&#x27;s\n    difficult to do that.\n  - Unable to search for text on the page.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve run into after five minutes of playing with it. I might keep this on my iPhone, but as it stands it&#x27;s unusable (compared to alternatives) on an iPad. Safari and Chrome generally get the iPad UX right.",1447379506

One of which is the sheer insanity of a single corporation knowing so much about us all and our relationships. Another is that checking Facebook all the time became a bad habit, like a twitch, something I felt the urge to do but then got no relief through doing. Another is probably spite - a rejection of the idea that having a FB account is necessary, something to be taken for granted.<p>Some observations:<p>- I have no idea what&#x27;s going on in the lives of many people I&#x27;m not in close contact with. I have no problem with this.<p>- My wife tells me about extended family stuff, and shows me the occasional photo. I&#x27;m okay with this.<p>- Instagram has replaced FB to a great degree, for me. But instead of being built around a growing social graph, my Instagram experience is built around a handful of friends and networks of interest. But my usage is nothing like the way I used FB. I post only when I have something to share, and I open the app probably once a week to peruse. I miss tons of stuff, and I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>- I&#x27;m involved with a bunch of athletic groups that use FB for events and communication. This is a problem. The degree to which FB has replaced email in this regard is crazy to me. I hope Slack etc. will prove effective at minimizing this.<p>- I&#x27;m launching a business soon and I was concerned that I&#x27;d _need_ to be on FB in some commercial capacity. But I honestly think that era is over. Other companies in my industry have anemic feeds that point to the low, low level of engagement through that channel.<p>- When I feel the need to waste time, some remnant of the FB &#x27;twitch&#x27;, I look at old faves like englishrussia.com or subject-matter porn like landandfarm.com or everydaycarry.com<p>- I call/FaceTime my mom more often.",1447379279

This can easily run on a telephone no sweat. Viola and Jones practically solved this problem in 2001.<p>- Find the parts of the face (eyes, nose, mouth), and then warp the face so it looks like it&#x27;s facing right at the camera. A recent paper at CVPR last year was called &quot;Face alignment at 3000 FPS,&quot; so this is also no sweat at all anymore.<p>- Extract the face&#x27;s features. This turns the pixels into a smaller vector representation (maybe a list of 1024 numbers perhaps). This is a bit tricky --- many current systems use convolutional neural networks to do this step, which typically take a lot of compute time. Maybe Facebook could shrink them down to a telephone.<p>- Compare that feature vector to your friends&#x27; vectors. In the verification setting, you know the &quot;feature vectors&quot; of your 500 friends, so you find the Euclidean distance between the image&#x27;s vector and the 500 others. No sweat.<p>- To get a recognition result, just pick the closest vector. Or, if the closest friend is too far away, return &quot;No Match&quot;.<p>There are many ways to build a good face recognizer. This is one of them.<p>This might or might not be what Facebook&#x27;s doing. Last year, they published a paper called &quot;DeepFace&quot; which works essentially this way but with some extra tricks. (The paper is here, but the focus was on comparing to academic state-of-the-art on a strictly academic dataset. It&#x27;s totally marketing / PhD recruiting bait. :P I&#x27;m sure their internal system they have now must be far better. <a href=""https://research.facebook.com/publications/480567225376225/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.facebook.com/publications/480567225376225/d...</a> )<p>The AI and ML people at Facebook are darn smart.

How can you visualize the current set of websites you are on, or this history of sites you have visited. Can you easily restore a bookmark set of twenty websites? If so, does it restore your window sizes, positions, and tab order? Can you easily identify which window/tab is making annoying sounds? Does it have a 1Password extension? Does it override standard OS features like Print (to PDF) with its own lame-ass UI for the same thing (lookin&#x27; at you Chrome)?  When you copy text, is it smart about putting the different representations of the copied data on the clipboard so it works optimally whatever app you are then paste into? Does it let you have different profiles to keep e.g. your work cookies separate from your pr0n cookies? Speaking of cookies, how easy is it to inspect and deal with them? How does its extension mechansim work, and what is its defense story against the installer-malware that comes with e.g. Java? Is it fast to launch? Can you easily re-open closed tabs and windows? If so, do they retain their state and Back/Forward history? Can you easily customize things like font and zoom and override bogus sites?

When I log in to Facebook, there&#x27;s a post from a guy who lives in a different country to me, who I met on a bus 8 years ago, posting about his crusade to stop his vet offering homeopathy(!). I see an update once every two or three days from this guy, but we&#x27;re not really close enough to send each other regular emails or messages. But last time we were in the same city, I sent him a message, and we had dinner, drinks, and went to a show. I listened to his latest album a few years back, and as a result, we had him play at our wedding. I have a <i>lot</i> of low-interaction friends like this, and they enrich my life incredibly. I would not have the mental energy or time to maintain lots of friendships like this by email.<p>I have a reasonably large extended family. We could start up a mailing list, but we&#x27;re not all related to the same people. When I see them in person, I have been &quot;keeping in touch&quot; because I&#x27;ve been seeing their family photos, seeing daily updates from them, and interacting with them. Again, I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to do this actively.<p>We have a party organized this weekend. There are 40 people on the invite list. A Facebook event has meant that we&#x27;ve invited a whole load of people who we might not have invited to a more intimate event, but also that we got suggestions for a bunch of people to invite - we went through our friends list, and often thought &quot;haven&#x27;t seen Joe in ages! I&#x27;d forgotten he was in town, let&#x27;s invite him&quot;. Facebook has kept track of who&#x27;s coming for us, and will gently nag our guests to reply either way. We don&#x27;t have cellphone numbers of email addresses for many of these people.<p>Conversely, a couple we don&#x27;t know very well has invited us to an event in a fortnight. We&#x27;re not that close to them, but we can see on Facebook that a whole bunch of our mutual friends who we do really really like are going. As a result, we&#x27;ll probably go.<p>Many of these things are <i>possible</i> without Facebook, they&#x27;re just much much harder, and we probably wouldn&#x27;t bother.<p><pre><code>    > 2. Are many people you know actually going exclusively\n    > to facebook as their sole communication method?

Facebook Messenger is the primary way I communicate socially with people. If I happen to have everyone&#x27;s cellphone, I&#x27;ll use WhatsApp, as it has a few more useful features, and not everyone has Messenger installed, but generally FB Messenger is how I communicate with people, as it&#x27;s a constant, even when they move country, change numbers, change email, whatever. I ran in to some old high school friends at a university alumni event recently, who I hadn&#x27;t seen in decades. I added one of them on Facebook, and he created a Messenger group with some other people we went to high school with, and we organized lunch. I could have gotten his email, and we could have done it that way, but I don&#x27;t think he had contact details for some of the other people he invited, other than Facebook.<p>I have three ex colleagues who I&#x27;d love to be more in touch with, who aren&#x27;t on Facebook. I try and see them when I am in the same city as them, but I often forget they&#x27;re around, and because I&#x27;m not up to date with what&#x27;s going on in their lives, we often have less to talk about.<p><pre><code>    > 3.

People who aren&#x27;t on Facebook are the big exception, and they tend to be the slightly kookier people.<p>The trade-offs seem hard to articulate. I don&#x27;t feel like my social graph is particularly private.

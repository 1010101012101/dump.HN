Seriously destabilizing a suicidal person is murder and on a moral level I don't believe in claiming that a particular murder is more or less immoral than another. Murder is murder and I don't think you can compare magnitudes. So if he had been an ordinary guy, his murder would still have been wrong on a moral level.

The <i>real</i> issue is that when packaging for say debian and RHEL you have to care about different glibc, different compiler versions with potentially different ABI, different filesystem conventions, different scripts for post install, etc... The format in which the files are packaged is the least of the issues compared to that. For example, packaging for opensuse once you have a package for RHEL is as much of a PITA than packaging for debian, really.<p>Once you standardize on what makes packaging difficult across distro, you basically end up with the same system. I think systems like the build service from Suse, etc... are much more useful than wishful thinking on packaging format.",1272343496

Hodgell†:<p>""That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.""<p>Some people seem to be afraid of truth. I've noticed this when I've turned down cheese, and upon being asked why, saying I think it's unhealthy for me. Often they start saying why they can't live without cheese, or why eating cheese regularly doesn't increase the risk of disease unless you have a certain risk factor (like high blood pressure or a sedentary lifestyle). This happens without me doing anything except turn it down. I find people have an easier time accepting it if I act like I'm turning it down for moral reasons rather than nutritional reasons.<p>As for how truth-avoidance leads to this: I think that people don't want to accept a certain truth often don't want to accept justice that's based on that truth.

Is he the first one there in the morning and the last one out?<p>From the outside it seems like he spends a lot of his time playing around on his side projects. Hanging out with cool people. And generally taking it easy. No one wants to kill themselves working for a guy that seems to be having fun doing unrelated things. VCs are even less okay with that, as far as I know.

The ones where you tell a funny story, and deliver a few key points, but don't actually explain everything. It is good when you trust the author, and don't have to get up to speed on the details.<p>Trust is important, because the presenter doesn't have to explain themselves very well. The emotive impact of pictures (or funny stories) can trick you into thinking they have filled the credibility gap. Malicious presenters can leave out details that should really be there - such as how the implementation will actually occur, or the justification of decisions, and so on.<p>It's also good if you already understand the details, or if you don't know or care about the technicalities. A written report has more space for the technicalities, which is very important if the information has to flow out of the silo you are in, or if the reader wants to drill down and check that you actually know what you are talking about.<p>I think that the whole ""interactions"" bit is a little over-hyped.

I went through all the scouting levels, and I think there's a lot of good things in there, I also think there's a lot of cruft left over from when it was a thinly disguised military preparedness course.  Salutes, khaki uniforms, ranks, etc : all a bit much for me back then, and I wouldn't put my own kids in it now.  Of course it has probably modernised quite a bit but I suspect a lot of it is still the same.<p>What I'd like to do is keep the good things about scouts : personal responsibility, teamwork, goal setting and acheiving, respect for adults etc and tie it in with an entrepreneurial focus : team building, idea generation, production, marketing, distribution, legal understanding.  The idea would be to work on mini-projects a bit like they do on 'the apprentice', with the goal of generating funding for both the club/group/whatever and of returning funds to charity.  There would also be aspects of social and environmental responsibility tied in with the work.  The projects would be fun for kids, whether it is commissioning a line of t-shirts, selling flowers or doing an e-bay drive.<p>My reasoning for this is that I think within the space of a couple of generations, people have gone from usually-self employed to usually-corporate employed, and as such get very little control over their lives.

You're being down voted because you're not very smart.<p>Dude, you essentially <i>made up</i> or misinterpreted the numbers you're using[1], then you make what amounts to completely irrational sweeping generalizations based on nothing but <i>two</i> numbers and/or your (limited) social experience..  And, admit it, you know these conclusions are offensive.  Not only that, but you can't even stand by your intentionally ambiguous statements about homosexual behavior after you post them -- you're not only an asshole, but completely gutless.<p>i.e. Shut the fuck up, kid.

We're much more exposed to examples of heterosexual couples raising children than homosexual couples, and, as Harvard's Implicit Association Test demonstrates, this could easily lead us to thing that one ""makes more sense"" than the other. Increasing positive exposure to the opposite end of things can change our opinion. Harvard's IAT site has more information (check out esp. the Q's about the Black-White test):

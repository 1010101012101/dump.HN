For progress, we need to understand the subject mathematically.<p>If you think that there has been no progress in these areas, I'm sorry, but you really don't know what you are talking about. Could that progress have been faster, had the maths behind it been formalized? Maybe so, yet I don't see that many mathematicians working on branch prediction on deep pipelining processor architectures, and plenty of other things that lowly CS-ers have worked out. Want to see more maths in all of CS? Maybe you need to bring them to it, in the form of useful tools that can deal with fast moving targets.<p>>what are the mathematical properties? Can't see any? Okay: Change programming languages until can.<p>I regret to say that that's not as easy as it sounds. There are issues of tractability, and more importantly, there's this not-quite-cottage industry of software development, which needs good-enough languages to use _today_.<p>> this is old stuff. It has leaped off the screen for decades. We want some known properties we can use to derive new, useful properties.<p>You mean like Agda, Epigram, and countless other formal systems for program specification, derivation and correctness proving?<p>> Instead all we get is programming languages that compete in some absurd 'beauty contest' or that 'encourage' programming 'styles' seen as 'helpful'. Sicko.<p>This coming from a mathematician is strange to hear. Elegance and expressiveness are important when programming. It makes for succinctness and less bugs, and improves programmer productivity (which down here in the real world, means $$$).<p>>How about stochastic processes? Any stochastic processes in server farms and networks?<p>How about them? Plenty of very CS-oriented research based on stochastic processes. I should know, I did my doctoral research within a 45 person team on networks and network modelling, where most of the big guys were mathematicians. These people (not me, I do very applied stuff in a very bastardized field) breathe and live Markov processes and queuing systems. I don't see what you're complaining about here.<p>>E.g., it has been common now in server farms to be concerned about reliability. So, we set up systems so that when system A gets too busy or fails, then system B takes over, etc. However, what we've seen, including at some of the most important farms, for decades, up to this year, is that these intuitive approaches far too easily go ""splat"" in the mud: They are 'unstable', have problems that propagate, and are surprisingly UNreliable.<p>The folks over at Google would like a word or two with you on this.<p>> Until CS gets serious about the math, it is writing checks its methodology can't cash.<p>Maybe, and yet it seems to be doing not at all bad, as far as I can see. Would more and better maths be useful? Surely so. Would relegating CS to ""footnotes"" make any sense? We surely disagree there.<p>There's a whole continuum in CS, from the highly abstract and ""math-y"" to very applied stuff that has a very faint, if any, relation with what mathematicians normally worry about, and yet is critical for actual applications. I just find it odd that you don't see that fact.<p>There is a trend towards more maths in plenty of CS topics that were once just ""practical stuff"", so maybe the day will come when maths departments will branch out into real-world CS, and CS students will need more math, as you'd like. Given that we've been doing ""maths"" for 3K years, and CS for less than 100, you might need to wait a bit, though.<p>Anyway, thanks for the discussion, and have a nice weekend.",1313268455

Or, in this case, with the right combo you both make the product better together - over time. When I see someone focusing on the immediate benefits of a co-founder, I wonder if it's short sighted.<p>For an analogy that may resonate with this community - think about a hacker house or group of programmers that are friends. Those relationships can make each of you better programmers. In effect, you're each helping each other move from, say C or B players, to A players. Imagine if you only thought someone at an equal or higher level than you could teach or help you with something.<p>You might carry more weight for the first 2 years, your partner's skills may become more valuable for the 2 after that. That's either a reality you accept in creating a true team or a point of tension for you - depending on your personality.<p>Of course, a solo founder can be a part of a community that helps them become better, just another perspective.",1313268385

It was an accident that I even got his resume (coincidentally, a <i>staffing intern</i> at my company mixed it up.  It was due for the bin [<i>HR and staffing</i> are for another rant, I'll leave it alone this time]).  He was a brilliant guy.  He interned for the half of the summer.  In a few weeks he went from zero experience with databases and directX, to developing a solution using both technologies (he wasn't a magician, the end-product was <i>good</i>, but required some reworking of code due to his applying knowledge from one language to another, but it was <i>done</i>, <i>usable</i> and with a bit of work <i>supportable</i>).  We offered him a full time position on the spot and he declined (he wanted to be in academia at the time, but ended up in industry a few years later).<p>Degrees are important.  Experience is important. <i>Intelligence</i> is important, but being intelligent and having degrees doesn't equate to success or the deserving of success.  I used to work with a guy who was the sort of guy you wanted to go out to lunch with (if you're a geek).  Very intelligent, had all sorts of ideas, could talk about anything related to his field (networking) and would challenge you to <i>think</i> about things differently. Unfortunately, he could talk all around theory, but he couldn't execute. It was a strange sort of inability to choose between several equally good approaches to solving a problem. Every project he worked on got about 3/4 to completion and then fell flat into failure.<p>And of course, the story of my two coworkers is certainly not a rigorous statistical understanding of the world.  It's my observation mixed with bias.  But it's worked so far in finding good, terribly unqualified individuals that can produce far more than they take away from me in time-spend.",1313267602

I'm not pleased with <i>how he went about it</i> (particularly the game he and his brother seem to be playing; Daniel's startup deposited exactly $625, the same amount Sam took.)  I'm not pleased with the ""yuppies buying coffee"" vs ""starving kids in Africa"" comparison.  But I'm glad this particular exploit has been exposed, which means we now have the opportunity to set up a better-and-safer version of Jonathan's Card.",1313266398

I don't see how the current tottering state of the economy explains his inability to find any employment at all from 1993 to 1999, which was as good a time for an engineer to be hired as I can imagine. I was there in that job market, and there was a constant problem of recruiters cold-calling people by randomly dialing company numbers and trying to tempt them with higher salaries. There were all sorts of company policies to stop that from happening, including assigning phone numbers out of a really large space and making incoming calls go through the receptionist. For a physicist and acoustical engineer with computer programming experience to not be employed at all in the late 1990s - sorry, blame it on anything you want, but don't blame it on the American economy.<p>EDIT: also, that same LinkedIn profile claims he started his masters degree in Plasma Physics in 1972, when he would have been around 16.

Not prematurely optimizing means choosing to prioritize your code structure to allow no-unexpected-side-effects changes and easy readability by other people, but it is not an excuse to use a O(n^2) algorithm when an O(n) algorithm can be used without cost.

The short version is that it is usually rooted in intractable personal problems:  Chronic health issues, abusive childhoods, mental illness and so on.<p>That is not intended to blame the victim. That's just reality:  Employers pay you for value added to the business, not as a charitable act.  If you have very big personal issues, you may not be very employable.  I have a chronic illness myself and was very fortunate to be able to be a homemaker and military wife for a very long time.  The good medical coverage from my husband's career was a godsend and it was helpful to be able to claim ""homemaker"" instead of ""unemployed bum for 20 years"" after I was finally diagnosed and well enough to work. I still had a hard time getting a job at all and I am still ""underemployed"" if you go by my education/skills.  But until very recently, the job I currently have was all I had energy for.  Anything more demanding would have gotten me fired.<p>I will also add that my understanding is that there is a general rise in homelessness, which points to systemic problems.

Run a production site ghost on some other platform (software/hardware bugs, ...), run by some other provider (bankruptcy, theft, ...) in another country (power cuts, earthquake, ...).

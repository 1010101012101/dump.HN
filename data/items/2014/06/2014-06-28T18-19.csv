It&#x27;s almost entirely due to the addressing setup times needed to access different parts of RAM (something I suspect most programmers don&#x27;t even know exists).<p>Programmers should actually be treating RAM the same way they treat disks, if they want the best possible performance the hardware can deliver. You can treat the L3 cache the way you used to treat RAMâ€”they&#x27;re certainly big enough these days!<p>One of the problem I work on is completely random access memory bound, so to scale, we now use ridiculously cheap CPUs (AMD Kaveri chips if anyone cares) paired with DDR3 2400 DRAM, $100 motherboards, and an Infiniband fabric and switch to keep them talking to each other quickly. (We use Kaveri&#x27;s because we also are doing GPU computation at the same time, and thanks to the slow RAM, the on-chip R7 GPU is more than fast enough to keep up.)<p>On the plus side, I get to spend way less time optimizing the code since the CPU just sits there idling most of the time, which is a nice change. :)",1403979683
7958858,comment,7956356,7956356,1,0,inthewoods,,,"Just my opinion, but to me cloud is more disruptive to B2B than mobile.  Not that mobile doesn&#x27;t have some level of impact that varies by industry, but most people working in my office aren&#x27;t using their mobile phones and tablets for data input - a key action that is performed by most office workers.  For B2B, therefore, web will likely be #1 and then they will have a mobile app that exist to reference into that system and do some specialized tasks.  In this way, the mobile app is just another application accessing the same system vs. a mobile app that exists on it&#x27;s own (such as, say, Instagram).<p>As an example, Salesforce.com, the &quot;standard&quot; in SaaS CRM has a mobile app, but the majority of the time users are in front of a laptop or computer during the day.  They may use the mobile app on the go, but people are not walking around our office using these apps - they&#x27;re at their desks where they&#x27;ve got a keyboard.<p>This obviously varies by industry - I&#x27;m sure people can provide examples where it would make a big difference (thought of one: services businesses with a lot of remote/scheduled workers ala lawncare).<p>Cloud infrastructure has been disrupting both in the delivery of SaaS applications and lowering the cost of developing and delivering a service.  I&#x27;m just not seeing mobile having the same level of impact.  The fact that most mobile apps that support SaaS applications are thrown in with the service may show that they don&#x27;t add huge value to overall revenue a SaaS company may see.",1403979621

7958854,comment,7958194,7958194,12,0,adrusi,,,"A lot of these ideas seem really good. I like that all processes run in CPU ring 0 and safety is ensured by the VM. It seems like this is more flexible and allows for more easily provable safety guarantees. That said, I think javascript is the wrong way to go, and especially how they&#x27;re doing it. Javascript carries with it the idea of garbage collection, which is fundamentally incompatible with hard realtime systems because it can create unpredictable pauses. What happens when a driver is communicating with a graphics card over a PCI bus or with an SSD over SATA and suddenly there&#x27;s a GC pause? It might miss some bytes, and in the worst case scenario, the serial data stream will still be valid and the driver will carry on like nothing happened, returning corrupted data.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat confused about the concurrency model in Runtime, The frontpage says it ditches traditional preemptive multitasking in favor of an event loop, but another pages says it runs a v8 isolate on each core. I&#x27;m going to assume that this means on my machine with 8 virtual cores there would be 8 parallel event loops. An eventloop for multiplexing OS processes on the timeline is simply not appropriate for the general usecase. If any process performs a CPU-bound operation, it would block all other processes in the same v8 isolate. This system is also not very good for multicore operations, it&#x27;s impossible to properly balance to load on each core, leading to poor performance. Traditional kernels can run a single thread on core A one millisecond and core B the next, but even if it&#x27;s possible to send a process between isolates, it would be a lot less efficient than simply remapping the address space.<p>I think it would be much better use LLVM bitcode instead of javascript. Instead of JIT compilation, the Kernel compiles the program to machine code when it loads it into memory, verifying that it&#x27;s not using any unauthorized constructs statically. LLVM bitcode is already being used like this by PNaCl. It offers the same security guarantees as javascript, but without the overhead associated with it.",1403979542

7958842,comment,7958194,7958665,2,0,thegeomaster,,,"Actually, I think there&#x27;s a pretty good motivation behind this.<p>When executing JS code in a browser, it runs inside a safe VM and can&#x27;t touch any of the memory or variables that don&#x27;t belong to it. However, the browser itself has to go through a lot of the abstractions and safeguards required by the kernel in order to run. Particularly, every syscall induces a context switch which costs a lot of CPU cycles. This happens on every operations that needs access to hardware, such as reading from a file or from a socket for IPC. Also, the kernel needs to update the MMU registers so it can map its own address space, invalidate the whole TLB, etc etc etc.<p>The basic idea here, it seems, is to avoid all these costs and build the system so the user can run nothing that isn&#x27;t a VM. The VM will provide fail-safes and terminate offending code. This allows everything to run in a single address space and under ring 0, thus avoiding context switching.<p>This is beneficial to (and only to) code that we used to run under a browser or some kind of JS virtual machine (Node.JS servers come to my mind here). Web apps such as editors (Atom maybe?) or any other kind can now run natively and run way faster, which is very important on low-cost low-end machines, without all the overhead that they know pay twice (first to virtualize JS from everything else, and then to virtualize the browser processes). However, the raw performance that can be gained from writing fast C/C++ code will essentially be lost. The more JS code you were running before, the more a naked metal JavaScript OS will benefit you.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me if this will ever be necessary. What I just said is the justification of the idea, just from the top of my mind. Anyone feel free to correct me if I screwed up the argument :)",1403979091

I can buy two or more servers in different counties, install the notary server on them, copy&paste the cert of the notaries in my client, and from that moment on Convergence works and my TLS connections are secure.<p>You misunderstand. The problem is not for the client when the attacker controls a DNS resolver, the problem is for <i>everybody</i> when the attacker controls a DNS TLD. You&#x27;re trying to verify the certificate for democracy.cn which is supposed to resolve to 1.2.3.4, but China changes its DNS record so that it points to 6.7.8.9 which is the Chinese government&#x27;s MITM server. Now you go out and ask ten thousand notaries, what&#x27;s the certificate for democracy.cn? They all resolve it to 6.7.8.9, get the attacker&#x27;s certificate from China&#x27;s MITM server and tell you they all saw the same certificate. But it&#x27;s the attacker&#x27;s certificate.<p>The existing CA system doesn&#x27;t solve this. The attacker that can control a TLD is the sort that can control a CA. But you&#x27;re claiming Convergence <i>would</i> fix it, which is a misunderstanding of what Convergence does. Convergence is solving an entirely different problem.<p>The thing that (mostly) fixes it is certificate pinning. It doesn&#x27;t fix it if the attacker starts the attack as soon as the server is put online (which is about a thousand times harder for the attacker to do than the status quo), and I&#x27;m not actually sure how they deal with certificates legitimately changing over time, but certificate pinning really does go a long way to preventing any central authority from being able to MITM arbitrary connections.<p>I see your confusion because Moxie Marlinspike is the one advocating both certificate pinning (i.e. Tack) and Convergence and you can use them together. But there is no technical reason you couldn&#x27;t <i>also</i> use certificate pinning in combination with DNSSEC. Or use all three together, essentially using the DNSSEC signed certificate as an additional notary.<p>The existence of Convergence as something cool we should all be using ten years from now doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t still need transitional measures in the meantime.
